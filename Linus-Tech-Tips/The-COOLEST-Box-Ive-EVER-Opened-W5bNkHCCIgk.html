guess it's more of a crate really is
pretty interesting so Intel brought me
sedatives and ammunition who you may or
may not be familiar with but we'll link
those guys down below down to do a video
about their 8086 processor and we
thought it was just kind of like we were
on a panel about PC gaming and game
streaming and then they brought us down
again
and actually surprised us with computers
that were based on sort of what we
imagined as our dream pcs and I was
particularly surprised because it is a
formidable challenge coming up with the
PC system for the guy who literally
already has every PC system this is the
wall of video cards so what did they
come up with I guess we're about to find
out aren't we after I tell you about our
sponsor for this video synergy synergy
allows you to share a mouse and keyboard
across multiple computers and it's even
compatible with Windows Mac OS Linux and
Raspberry Pi check it out at the link in
the video description
okay so first things first let's get
this moved somewhere a little more
picturesque okay that seems better so
there were a couple of sort of guiding
things that I had said in the video
obviously I love quiet systems because
in my mind there's just no reason to
have a loud system anymore now that
cooling technology has advanced to the
point that it has another thing that I
mentioned was my love of retro machines
and not retro in the sense that they
have really old hardware inside retro in
the sense that they're kind of like like
classic machines that have been updated
so one of my favorite things that we've
done in the last couple of years has
actually been the sleeper series that
alex has worked on those these are just
kind of like random boxes that we've
found at the local free geek and then
converted into you know bang in gaming
rigs I was gonna do all these by hand
just to like add to the suspense of the
video but I saw how many there were I
don't think they can handle that much
suspense you know the thing about the
Internet is somewhere someone is into it
no matter what it is somewhere someone
is like oh yeah taking out screws and
putting them in could watch that all day
so what's really interesting is that
instead of going to the usual suspects
you know BS mods or Lea Harrington or
whoever else in the PC modding scene
Intel actually solicited the help of a
company that's more into like Hollywood
props building and less into computers
and so they were basically just given
the footage of us describing our dream
machines and told to make them come to
life
well Oh so when we set up this space I
actually forgot that there's a monitor
that goes with the system so I'm gonna
go ahead and get this out of the way as
much as it pains me to do so because
this is an amazing monitor right here
which isn't to say that in spite of what
it looks like this one is the worst
gaming monitor ever and you'll see what
I mean in a minute here I get such a
kick out of this thing I've seen it
before and I'm still like I'm laughing
inside just in anticipation so that's it
it's not the most practical approach to
skinning up a monitor that I could have
possibly imagined because as you guys
might already suspect yes the front
cover here does in fact cover up the
corners of the monitor so it's actually
kinda hard to use and these dials these
dials don't do anything but this is
definitely the most complete attempt at
retro izing a modern display that I
think I've ever seen so they're using
like a high density kind of prop foam
here that they've shaped and painted and
then they've painted the back of the
display and what I think is a really
great really close approximation to the
kind of ugly greeny brownie tan color
that you'd often find on older systems I
don't know if that plastic was just
cheaper or if they actually thought that
looked space-age or whatever but so I'm
sure you guys are eagerly anticipating
the system now that you've seen this
this thing is unbelievably cool I mean
here they're actually under this very
table we're opening it on is a perfect
example of why it's impossible to send
Linus a dream system I already have a
murder box wait now I should preface
this by saying that while some people
are going to love this
there are going to be others who are
actually kind of upset now what happened
here because the case that was chosen
for this particular retro sleeper well
let's just say there aren't a lot of
good condition
IBM 5150 s left out in the wild and now
there's one fewer because this is what
they sent over and absolutely tricked
out and you can't really call it a
sleeper anymore because of this gorgeous
acrylic window on the top but it's a
tricked out IBM 5150 chassis and the
level of attention to detail in this
thing is unfreaking real I'm gonna walk
you guys through it here before we fire
it up for the first time
we first have to appreciate one of the
finest details here so you can see
obviously this this old chassis was not
designed for modern standard ATX
components so they had to create their
own acrylic backplate with check this
out those are when logos cut into the
the grille for the radiator and then
also our motherboard and our GPU which
is mounted using a PCI Express riser the
most impressive part to me though is
this they actually integrated the
original power switch so instead of
having a chintzy little power flippity
doo-dah on the back and they redid all
the internal wiring have a look here so
that it actually functions as the switch
for the back of the power supply so sick
so check this out
not only does the original power button
work and have an LED behind it to
indicate that the system is on so even
though these floppy disk bays arent
functional check this out
drive activity is still handled by the
original LEDs and then these slits down
the middle are actually functioning as
an intake for cooling the graphics card
you're ruining everything Brandon you're
supposed to talk about it on camera Oh
okay anyway the cooling system is
actually pretty ingenious so to keep
dust from getting in they've got an
intake here and an intake here and then
the whole thing just kind of blows out
the top so they've got like I don't know
whatever that is about three quarters of
an inch the CPU now this was interesting
because everyone else got 79 ATX ease
and so I was kind of like yo I got an 80
86 K like what's the deal with that and
they were like well we thought the 8086
K made perfect sense given that this is
an original IBM 5150 chassis which had
the original 8086 in it yeah you know
what we should do we should get Alex to
look at this and see if he thinks he can
beat it
yeah so I told Intel that one of the
coolest projects I think we've done over
the last little while or some of the
coolest projects have been the sleeper
machines and this was kind of their take
on fusing retro with new no those don't
do anything okay you can go so I've
already found one unexpected side effect
of yeah sure how's that just put that
back on there oh so this is cool because
the 8086 K is the highest performance
single thread processor on the market
check this out our local steam cache is
actually working better than ever before
so when we tested it we were having a
hard time getting such impressive
numbers on titles that have a lot of
compression because we actually run into
cpu bottlenecks but on this one
81 megabytes per second download in
Grand Theft Auto 5 from our local cache
that's really good for that title
yeah grand theft auto 5 over 80 dad
single thread performance no matter how
cool your system is
you can't get anything done when Windows
decides hey how about now
and I actually have an IBM model M from
1986 that I can hook up to it here that
looks so good like so good
ah this blows I actually don't have my
ps2 adapter here so disappointing I am
NOT very familiar with that rock style
style let's just go for 5 gigahertz
full-auto and see if it manages that
boom speed 5 gigahertz I'll be curious
to see if that download goes even faster
now yep we just hit 85 peak pretty sure
that's the best we've seen so far
alright so let's see how she performs
yes max zero and we are sitting
somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 to
300 frames per second at any given
moment here I mean it still doesn't help
me aim at anything but what it is then
that's butter smooth so as a TN panel so
frankly not the most color accurate
experience ever but this thing's running
out a hundred and forty-four Hertz
of course we expected that with like an
80 86 K and GTX 1080i but man bots suck
oh they still suck they still suck I
just I own that I'm also not very good
so that's pretty much it
what we've got so far is the coolest
retro themed gaming system that I have
ever seen but I really don't think this
is the last you're gonna see this and
I'd love to hear from you guys what
would you like to see us do to this
thing to take it to the next level
please
leave your comments below because we've
already got some ideas on our own but
definitely interested in what you guys
think and we're also interested in
telling you guys about Thermaltake
Thermaltake is celebrating 20 years of
thermaltake with their level 20 cases
they've got four styles to choose from
the VT the XT the GT and an updated
version of their triple chambered full
tower case they all feature sleek modern
design with rounded front corners and
tempered glass and they've got ample
room for cable management and radiators
if you're into water cooling they also
feature USB type-c connections for the
IO and you can check out the link in the
video description to get yours on
amazon.com so thanks for watching guys
if you disliked this video then you must
not like fun but you can't hit that
button that is your right but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured how how good luck
at the link in the video description you
could get an AV 86 K or a GTX 1080 TI or
a 2080
as far as most people can tell is pretty
similar until RDX comes also down there
is our merch store which has closed
stores like this one at our community
forum which you should definitely join
one thing's for sure this mouse has to
go a little more off-white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
