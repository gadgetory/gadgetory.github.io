with the original pixel for me was that
while I did end up using it for a couple
of months it was a bit of a one-trick
pony an expensive one at that and a good
camera or even a great camera is not
enough for me I need a phone that knows
what I want a phone that shares my
interests a phone that I can't wait to
greet at the end of the day with a great
big hug or failing that a little squeeze
I also need sponsors like Intel who keep
this show going CyberPower pcs lineup of
gaming desktops feature Intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below
in some ways Google launched two
different sizes of the same phone both
the pixel two and the pixel two XL
feature basically the same internal
specs with the main difference being the
amped up battery on the larger model to
power the larger screen and I was both
surprised and pleased to find out during
the October 4th event that both phones
even get the same optical and electronic
image stabilization and portrait mode
camera features a move that is much
appreciated by those of us with both
small hands and precious moments to
capture but pretty much any flagship
Android phone these days has the same
internal specs including the Galaxy s8
that launched six months ago so we have
to look a little closer to see that
while they are clearly related they're
also as different as I am from my
siblings they both still sport a
rear-mounted fingerprint sensor
satisfyingly clicky lock buttons a 12
point two megapixel single rear camera
and the partial glass backed design that
debuted on the original pixel but is
somehow much more refined looking this
time around but then when we flip them
over they're like nothing alike it's
almost like they were made by completely
different contract manufacturers with
different capabilities so the pixel 2 is
lightweight with squared off edges
making it easy to handle but a little
chunky looking with larger top and
bottom bezels to make room for stereo
speakers and I guess the rest of the
basically no compromises internals the
XL by contrast is the far more 20-17
looking of the two devices little
changes like the seamless transition
from the body to the sexier curved glass
and wider gamut
not to mention much higher resolution
display wouldn't really bother me as a
pixel to buyer but the taller aspect
ratio of the display makes
handling of the devices very different
in day-to-day use the pixel puts less
strain on your thumbs to reach the
spacebar while you're typing while the
Excel uses its extra screen height to
compensate for the space lost to the
on-screen buttons by comparison it also
fits a lot more content on the screen at
a time though it should be noted that
both of them lose out to the galaxy s 8
and the node 8 in this regard
and this affects media playback in a big
way too if you're a movie watcher by the
xl2
period surprisingly they both managed to
pack similar and impressive sounding
stereo front-facing speakers like
seriously HTC boomsound lovers y'all got
something to upgrade to finally but
while six inch versus five inch doesn't
sound like that big of a deal the pixel
wastes far more of its screen real
estate in ultra wide content so think
about how much bigger a 50-inch TV looks
compared to a 40 inch TV that is the
difference on to day-to-day usability
once I added a specifically compatible
well thankfully inexpensive type C to
three-and-a-half millimeter adapter to
my headphone pouch the pixel 2 and the 2
XLR that they're just a pleasure to use
gone is the stress about incidental
water splashes from last gen and I gotta
say while I had no pressing desire for a
squeezable phone how tall is Linus
Sebastian I really like it as a super
natural way to bring up the Google
assistant to the point where I even
found myself just using the Google
assistant a lot more than I have in the
past now you'll hit it by accident a
fair bit at first just trying to pick
your phone up off the table or put it
into your pocket but the sensitivity has
a wide adjustment range so if you're not
the kind of person who's voice saying OK
Google would take about
minutes to capture and steal ok Google
ok Google ok Google and you're
comfortable with the reduced security of
a voice recognition unlock man there are
a lot of fast ways to get things done
ok Google assuming of course that what
you want to get done isn't that
complicated the thing for me is that the
more that these digital assistants can
do the more obvious it becomes what they
cannot do so I can open Google Docs
handy but I can't then open a specific
document or start dictating without
touching my phone I can search for Drive
badminton center and I can navigate
there but then I can't add a stop at a
name W on my way without touching my
phone while I'm in the car and it's
stuff like this that makes the whole
exercise feel a little pointless I mean
no not not pointless that's not fair but
but definitely incomplete I mean I can
see how folks who just want to perform
discrete singular tasks like turn off
the light or play that song that I like
would be really happy with the current
state of things but for some reason a
lot of what I end up wanting to do is
going to result in me entering it
manually at some point anyway and if
that's the case it's usually faster to
just do it myself correctly the first
time rather than relying on what is much
better but still imperfect voice
recognition a perfect example is that it
recorded this as in perfect
instead of imperfect and the screen
turned off while I was finishing the
recording because I've been talking for
a minute sigh and of course I meant hi
not that sigh the good news is that even
if you don't give a crap about Google
assistant Android Oreo has plenty to
love in no particular order here are a
few things that made my life better
versus the iPhone 8 and the galaxy s 8
upcoming events at the top of the
homescreen super nice to have holding
task switcher to run multiple apps on
screen
to work with Netflix boo but wit
supported apps it's faster smoother and
more intuitive for multitaskers than
ever before being able to snooze
notifications is a godsend for busy
people like me so finally there is a
middle ground between dismissing them
and forgetting about them and having
them just pile up and better management
of background app power usage makes the
pixel to behave very nicely for a phone
with only a twenty seven hundred million
power battery
I have gripes still though Google allows
bootloader unlocking but I shouldn't
need to load a custom ROM to do
something as simple as swapping the on
screen nav buttons and this suggestion
that I found on reddit was even more
annoying than reaching all the way over
for back and while we're at it I capture
markup and send out a lot of screenshots
and stock Android screenshot management
sucks compared to iOS 11 and third-party
variants of Android bringing us to the
camera even though it lacks a few
shooting modes compared to its
competitors like 60 FPS 4k or ultra high
frame rate slo-mo it's great but don't
take my word for it here's our resident
camera guru Brandon to tell you guys how
the front-facing camera is okay if you
turn off the tear facial processing and
the back shooter is great and you're
gonna love it
the front-facing camera is okay if you
turn off the to face retouching and the
rear camera is great
that's it I mean could you do a
follow-up video next week maybe
comparing the pixel two to the iPhone 8
and the no DEET or something okay
well great then so bottom line
should you buy it's actually kind of
hard to evaluate especially the pixel to
excel in the absence of its true
competitor the iPhone 10 but squeezed
changed the game a lot more for me than
I thought
even if almost everything else about it
especially the absence of wireless
charging it still feels like the Nexus 2
pixel price hike was a bit of a kick in
the balls so I like the design much
better than the super boring iPhone 8
but iOS 11 and Tweedy touch are great so
is face ID better than squeeze and
Google assistant how about the camera on
the 10 these are all questions that need
answers unless of course you're a
die-hard Android user and you were never
going to consider the dark side anyway
so for you guys the pixel to excel gets
a strong recommendation with the two
just behind it due to its fat bezel and
last gen 16 by 9 screen so yeah you
probably already knew this but these are
the Android phones to have right now
assuming of course that you're a great
big baller speaking of being a great big
baller why not look like a baller with a
D brand skin on your phone debrand is
your source for awesome vinyl skins and
they've got them for laptops phones
tablets consoles controllers and more
they use high-quality authentic true
textured 3m vinyl on every product and
their skins are cut with unrivaled
precision so use their configurator see
what your products gonna look like you
could go with the panda or the reverse
panda for your pixel - even if you can't
get one and not only that but you get a
little bit of protection against
incidental scuffs and scratches they
ship worldwide they've got great
customer service and you can
