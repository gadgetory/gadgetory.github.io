interesting to unbox I got cameraman
helping me today we have the pro art
series LCD monitor PA 2 for 6 from a
soos now what makes this unique with
quite frankly any number of monitors on
the market that are 24 inches okay they
have black bezel you know height
adjustment potentially you know built-in
USB hub built-in card reader I does
support picture-in-picture which is kind
of neat but what separates this from
every other monitor on the market with a
black bezel and the 24 inch diagonal
screen well we're going to get into that
a little bit because yeah what I
realized about monitor unboxings is they
take a really long time because monitors
are big and I'm like weakened from the
internet so and yes I stole that from
crazy Russian he says it all the times
that he's from the internet and I'm like
okay um so yeah what I realize is that
LCD unboxings take a long time because
they're big and bulky and kind of
ungainly to deal with and I always tell
you guys everything about the monitor
before I actually open the box so I'm
not going to make that mistake today I'm
going to unbox the product and then when
I can show you the product itself I'm
gonna tell you all about it so here we
have the accessories under a bottom
layer styrofoam we get lots of different
accessories this is terrific we get a
cable tie o to cable ties no it's one
there - just one nice that is getting
pretty excited there for a second next
we get a support CD and VIP member
notice to notice okay all right I'm
noticed I noticed it Quick Start Guide
excellent plug the thing into the thing
hit the power button probably something
along those lines
woo
check this out okay so I didn't I didn't
get to save this for when the the
monitor actually was was unboxed but
check this out so this is a color
calibration testing report this report
was run on your serial number this is
not batch color calibration that is why
this monitor is expensive this is an
out-of-the-box calibrated LCD monitor
that is why it is called a pro art so
I'm going to finish showing you guys
that yeah yeah there's that don't put
this bag over your own face or your
baby's face or your face is done okay so
we'll get into more of the other
features that are professional oriented
later ah thank you cameramen here are
the cables that are included with one
DisplayPort cable so I'm going to go
ahead and jump out on a limb here and
assume the monitor supports DisplayPort
you've got VGA cable don't use that
crying out loud please don't buy $500
monitor and then use that and we have a
DVI cable we also have a power cable
pretty standard as well as a USB a 2b
cable for a printer USB cable for the
built-in hub so I'm going to go ahead
and hold on to these accessories and
let's get this monitor opened up there
is file appearances no real assembly
required to speak of I'm gonna go ahead
and take off the plastic here we've got
an adjustable stems pretty sweet I like
the UH
I already like the base on the mounting
arm feels very very very smooth when
you're adjusting things compared to some
of the less expensive ones that I team
okay so why don't we go through all the
range of motion that we can do be a sous
pa 2 4 6 so we can go up and down so
here's the very bottom you can see that
the monitor is actually almost resting
right on the base we can go up this high
okay tilt we can go way up here we can
go way down there okay I knew very few
people sit and look up at their monitors
so that's you know doesn't need to go
too far down it's better if you look at
this from this side I think okay pivot
look at that
it can pivot all the way to that side
and all the way to that side so that's
like that that's that's pretty good
seems to me okay ah you can also do this
actually I believe this is called oh
yeah I know this is swivel that's right
so can swivel can go into portrait mode
can't quite go upside down okay go ahead
and do that let's have a look at the
physical characteristics of it it's
quite thick this is not a thin monitor
it's not like a dainty monitor this is
meant for professional use so it's going
to be built up as much hardware as they
deem necessary to put inside it they're
just going to do it they're not going to
try and make it thinner so it's going to
have lots of ventilation holes all along
the top here actually only about half of
these are ventilation holes same thing
here on the back right here this is kind
of funny to me but almost everything on
this monitor has um centimeter and
centimeter and a half markings on it oh
no it looks like it's inches on the on
the oh no ok there's inches and
centimeters no that's kind of neat but
so yeah you can see that's mark you can
see down here is also marked and then
there's an indicator at the front so it
actually shows you okay you're here that
far off now and then there's a little
dot to indicate okay you're at the
maximum
so there's halfway and then max and then
same thing here at the back for the
height adjust everything is marked
that's kind of neat okay let's go ahead
and have a look at our inputs so I'm
going to go ahead and tilt it back check
out the bottom here I'm not sure if
we're gonna have enough light from that
angle I'm gonna actually tilt it this
way and then you can have a look from
that side okay so we've got our USB in
I'm Pierce p.audio
we have VGA DVI oh yeah okay there's the
seven in one card reader as well as the
two USB ports on the side okay we've got
HDMI in DisplayPort in so we have pretty
much every option we could possibly need
as far as inputs go we've got our power
as well as a power switch there's a
warranty void a seal damaged thing on
the bottom here so that's a make sure
you don't do that alright
let's go around to the I don't know
buddies on about sound I already said
that yeah yeah has speakers right maybe
doesn't okay hold on I'll be back yeah
okay so those are just for the hdmi and
displayport inputs so that you can
actually plug headphones into the
headphone jack on the bottom of the
monitor and you can hear sound that way
so cameraman is now showing you some of
the features that i promised to talk
about once we got the monitor out of the
box and that is that this uses an IPS
panel so IPS is out of the three main
LCD panel technologies that is TN VA
which would be P VA MVA or IPs this is
the highest end one in terms of color
accuracy as well as professional use so
that's why it is the pro art something
else that I wanted to point out to you
guys this is a 1920 by 1200 monitor it
uses a proper PC 16 by 10 aspect ratio
instead of the Moore theater and movie
oriented 16 to 9 that gives you that
extra little bit of vertical that gives
you more space to work when you are
using a PC desktop as opposed to
watching a movie I mean for gaming 1080p
is great but for professional work I
really do prefer to have that extra
little bit of vertical okay we've also
got the advertise here okay uses Adobe
RGB we've got the color accuracy is down
to a Delta II of less than 5 which I'm
to understand is quite impressive that
basically means that the color is very
accurate sixaxis color adjustment
supports picture-in-picture the
ergonomics 10 we've definitely looked at
already as well as the USB hub and seven
in one card reader now here's something
that I thought was pretty darn cool so
you can see all of the right side of the
monitor there are little marks as well
as all along the top those are in all in
inches so you've got inch half inch and
quarter inch marks and then all along
the left side and all along the bottom
of the mark of the bottom of the monitor
is a metric so that's in centimeters and
half centimeter increments so I thought
that was hilarious I don't know why but
I thought it was on screen menu we don't
normally show
this on tech tips but since we have the
monitor plugged in anyway we might as
well so you got a few different modes
here about some color settings got some
image settings got some picture and
picture settings you can select your
input which is much easier to do with
the input button as well as system setup
there is a quick fit button which it
requests that I try so why don't we try
it Wow look at that sweet that's
actually really cool so it puts an
overlay right over top of the screen in
centimeters or in inches and I'm gonna
go ahead and assume oh look at the look
at this
oh that's cool so you can quickly find
out how big the thing you're working
with is just by using this button so
there's your 8 by 10 there's your 5 by 7
huh that's cool eh and yeah ok it
doesn't actually line up with the ones
on the side of the monitor so these seem
to be mostly for show but this this is a
cool feature ok well I think that's
pretty much it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the pro art PA 246 Q from a soos
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other videos and actually before we
finish up right here I got to tell you
guys the color and the image looks about
right up until about this angle for me
so cameraman can come over here where I
am right about there so the viewing
angle is phenomenal actually really
impressed with that
you come to expect that from an IPS
panel also it's not a matte screen so
there are no there are no rather it is a
matte screen there it's not a glossy
screen so there's no user really shiny
screen to make the contrast and the
colors look more vibrant tricks going on
here it's all just the quality of the
panel of the quality of the backlight
and it is using a matte screen which is
preferable for color accuracy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
