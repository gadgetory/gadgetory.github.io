editors with six graphics cards but we
don't have six graphics cards I don't
know what accent that is now it's not
often around here that we have a project
that's so big we don't even have enough
hardware to validate if it's going to
work but that's what six video editors
one CPU has been like but the good news
is that even though some of the final
hardware isn't quite here yet
we have enough to know for sure if it's
gonna work so we've got all six monitors
and the keyboards and mice that go with
them for all of our stations we've got
our pile of high-end graphics cards over
here I don't know if you guys can even
see this but I want one per system over
here we've got all this is really cool
where is it ah here it is we've got the
replacement for that PCIe 4x interface
to our daughter board so I believe this
is either 8 X or 16 X which means we
shouldn't run into bottlenecks for all
of our USB controllers and we've got
Intel op teen along with the cards to go
with that and better coolers for our 28
core CPUs so today is the acid test does
it actually work we're gonna find out
smartdeploy allows IT departments to
reimage unlimited computer models from
one golden image search their library
and grab your exclusive free licenses
worth over $600 at smartdeploy com / -
so first order of business is to kind of
reconstruct what's going on in here
because we've had to tear apart a lot of
it over the last little while due to
other projects like that crazy thing
with the four Titan V's and all that
nonsense so let's go ahead and get back
to a functioning state and then we will
go from there now because a big part of
the goal today is eliminating all of the
hypotheticals we're gonna do away with
things like our gigantic split-screen
four-way monitor and we're gonna
actually set up each workstation as it
is intended to be used with a single
monitor and keyboard and mouse although
it should be noted that we could easily
run dual monitors since we're just
passing through entire graphics cards
we're not quite going back to the
previous state though one thing that we
are going to change is this so now
instead of a half-height like low
profile card that passes through PCI
Express 4x we have got this honkin sucka
that we're gonna go ahead and I'm not
sure which one's the host side and which
one is the target side but we're gonna
go ahead and install one of them into
here you know what I think it actually
has dip switches so that you can
configure it
they're both configured the same way
maybe it doesn't
ah so on on
oh my god it like it doesn't indicate
what for six just one to four ah
we'll figure it out okay so I think I
figured it out these little switches we
just need them in on on off for this guy
and then hold on off on on four one two
and four and oh okay but then six is
labeled backplane type yeah it looks
like we are running PCIe 8x although if
we got our hands on another one of these
cables we could run 16x by using dual
host I think or something anyway
8x should be enough to start is just
ridiculous like this connector look at
it so even compared to the 4x connector
we had last time which looks ba that's
the 8x connector this is great I found
the card from last time so instead of
this card now we need this card so it's
basically exactly this doubled up sheesh
now we got to get the other side
installed in our system here
that's the only configurable thing on
here let's go ahead and install it here
these are all in I've got my nvme drives
here so the next thing I need ah there
we go
is the test cart hooked up to the back
of the system here and then why do that
Yvonne is setting up all the stations
with their monitors keyboards and mice
though it will be a little bit until
we're actually quite ready for that can
I get that big fit yep exactly that and
I think we should be ready to fire up
the system I hooked up the power button
this time to make my life a little bit
easier so I guess we find out if that
works right now Oh Oh what the crap
let the motherboard back in without
actually hooking the motherboard power
back up whoo
okay it's a little better so ridiculous
you have to sign up for an account to
get a user manual for this card and it
wasn't working so fine I'm signed up and
here we go okay I think I did it
entirely wrong but I'm not sure why as
their diagram here doesn't actually
correspond to the number of dip switches
that's on here on four one and two off
four three and four that is completely
different from what it says here as far
as I can tell on four one and two off
four three and four I really hope this
works
so I think it's configured right now
what we should see is this fan spin when
I power up and
we got nothing and I don't know why okay
there's another dip for black back plain
type and that's just labeled directly on
here
so let's try selecting a different
backplane type shall we
nothing no power to it at all maybe we
have to do the same thing on the other
side wait oh no I turned this off while
I was troubleshooting oh this is what
happens when you hurry
not that that fixed it okay now hold on
a minute I think I get it
oh boy okay whatever that is probably
isn't good stop stop stop stop stop
okay so off on off on so whatever node
you're using now you have to go from the
bottom port out into the top port and
yeah I don't know it's on so maybe it's
working there it is they have flashing
lights on their slots but they're
detected so presumably they're working
one way we can tell for sure is just
plugging this mouse into into one of
them you can wait no I think I already
have them dubbed yeah I do okay that's
fine that's fine
oh snap oh crap oh shoot I just
unplugged this that's really bad
probably oh shoot oh I hope this still
works
I'm smell burning it's turning back on
and everything looks normal hopefully
that's fine what just happens there
so the next stage assuming that we're
still past getting this to work stage is
10 gig networking for the whole thing oh
it still works
that's good there it is or 10 gig all
right now I just just need to copy our
install images off or at least one of
them cuz it's time for us to put obtain
it that's how everyone does it
that's industry standard so I actually
only had 5 USB cards in here before I
found another one that gives us the full
complement of 6 and it's happening I'm
swapping out these peasant 750 series
drives for obtained the reason we care
about running opt in for our boot drives
is that these handle random i/o much
better than traditional SSDs and when
we're gonna have 6 operating systems
running off them at the same time that
becomes really important oh shoot I
totally forgot I got to put all the
graphics cards in C X little P Titan X
ok so Titan X Titan XP 1060 1070 and
maybe we'll put another quadrille in
there I don't know
now we've yet to actually boot this
motherboard with 6 graphics cards so
we're in uncharted territory right now
this could be the thing that kills the
entire project just a melon
so Jake Jake this is real that I'm there
okay this last card is our janky Asst I
think it's gonna have to kind of hang
out right there should be fine now we
fire it up and we have a display out so
that's a good sign that's not a good
sign I know we're asking for a lot here
motherboard but if you could come
through for me what the hell I don't
think I have ever heard a hardcore
sounding error code like that followed
by the system just booting Oh in order
to display this message some PCI devices
were set to a disabled State oh maybe
about 4G decoding will solve this
problem okay let's see if about 4G
decoding is gonna help us boom there it
is I think we're booting now did it just
turn off now why didn't it pick up my
boot device well that's interesting our
the USB key is just not even in here
anymore okay so the only thing I changed
was disabling the boot option ROM from
all of our PCI Express devices which I
can't imagine mattered and then I moved
our USB boot device into a different USB
port I wonder if one of our onboard USB
controllers isn't working because now
it's showing up although maybe it was
just a fluke last time I I don't know so
it's here now let's see all right so now
we're going obtain on our cache and
starting the array
there's our Titan XP there's our Titan
there's our gtx 1060
there's our Quadro GV 100 there's
another one and there's our 1070 all six
graphics cards are here and six USB
controllers at least beautiful and
there's our 10 gig card I think we've
got everything we need here I should go
do my own show so update time when show
is now complete and we can start to dig
in and make sure everything's working
the way we expected now I still only
have my four VM set up from the last
test but this is as simple as making
some reconfigurations to the CPU
assignments the GPU assignments and the
USB card assignments and tippity Boppity
we should be off to the races so
theoretically we are gonna just fire
this bad boy up and and go now once we
know everything's working and it's time
to performance optimize we're gonna want
to do things like make sure that none of
the VMS have CPU cores that cross from
one CPU socket to another because then
we're gonna take a performance hit there
and we're also going to want to make
sure that every VM has a graphics card
that's in a slot that is actually also
directly connected to the CPU that those
cores are physically present on that's
going to be really important I think I
might have bumped that stupid cable
again the whole system restarted when I
bumped that external PCI Express cable
well I don't think it's because I bumped
the cable I think it's because I don't
really have the cards screwed in okay
well while we wait for that we can do
the totally safe plugging in of display
cables so can I just take a moment to
point out how good I am at plugging in
monitor cables without looking
that noscope monitor plugging in David
can I get an HDMI cable from down there
sorry it's just hard for me to get down
do you ever just like picture the
engineers at Intel in an video watching
something like this oh okay let's make
sure all of our USB doodads are still in
here 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 up
number Five's not not doing anything did
that one fail execution error could not
find device all right we're just gonna
do yield reboot and reseed all that
stuff now let's try firing this up again
and it should be fine so I think what
happened was the USB controller for this
one disconnected from the system when I
bumped the cable and then the one for
this one took the fifth slot so neither
of them was able to start also what we
can do now is we can come around here
and see if any of these monitors are
lighting up this one just turned blue so
I think that means it's about to light
up hey there's one okay we got hey one
this is not working you want to let me
know when you see a pop up over there
like I'm gonna plug in a mouse oh that's
it now we should be able to figure out
which VN is supposed to be on all of the
other monitors here theoretically this
is ws1 but my display isn't lit up so
what I'm hoping is that I'll like move
the mouse and it will wake up
honestly I don't even know what's going
on right now also the name of this
didn't change what is going on here
yo hey wake up like this one just went
from having a blue light to having no
signal and a yellow light as I'm
shutting down VMs so what we can do in
the meantime I guess is unread has a new
version or two actually since I
installed this so why don't we update
that and see if everything magically
resolves itself the plot thickens
now that we're rebooting the system to
apply our update we have power to this
keyboard my level of pissed off right
now is pretty high now I've seen
monitors that have a bit of a hard time
picking up signals I have a hard time
believing that six monitors here I'll
have the same problem but I just say no
signal so my theory about those cards
being in order whenever it works we're
gonna label it as quickly as we can yeah
all right next up is this guy that's not
what I was expecting so this is the ten
sixteen which one is that who knows so
the little game we're playing it's
called find the patterns and so far the
only one that has managed a successful
reboot he's number five I believe that's
the one that I assigned the sound card
to wouldn't that be funny okay that's
actually booting there's four so it lit
up but it has not actually managed to
start loading windows yet oh there it
goes now one thing John from unrated was
that we ended up screwing up where our V
disks were some of them are on the array
and some of them are on the cache and he
had said he's run into some weird IO
bottlenecking nonsense with the way that
storage devices
are virtualized that might be explaining
some of the finicky behavior so we need
to make sure all of those are on the
opt-in drives number five came up so
this one's now consistent which is good
to see this is getting very interesting
so six and two are the ones we haven't
seen yet so everything that we've had
working so far is working right now six
gonna line up for me so six should be
this one theoretically all right so
let's try moving those V disks and see
if that solves it yeah neither of those
are coming up okay okay we have some
material to work with here I'm gonna
shut her down for now P ia hides your
true IP address and allows you to bypass
your restrictions and censorship by
making you appear as though you're
connecting from somewhere else and you
can use up to five devices at once it
also helps prevent attacks by blocking
unwanted connections it Auto blocks all
traffic if the VPN disconnects and it
keeps your data out of the hands of
advertisers and other activity tracking
snoops so go try it out at the link in
the video description
today it's affordable and it works
we got you might as well eat some privet
like don't don't die over this project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
