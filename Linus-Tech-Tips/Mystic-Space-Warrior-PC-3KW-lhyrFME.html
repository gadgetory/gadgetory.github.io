NVIDIA Star Wars Titan graphics cards is
that they paired the Jedi Order with the
Galactic Empire which is just you know
what though it's fine
I mean full points for effort at least
and honestly I barely even care anyway
okay thank you all for joining me I
understand that NVIDIA probably had the
best of intentions but there's one
fundamental problem here and that is
that Senator Palpatine Darth Sidious
whatever the you want to call this goal
these two entities never actually oppose
each other directly which led me to my
second realization we had to make a
video that showcased these bad boys so
this my friends is the mystic space
warrior knowledge cube build
the twenty liter moss pack features a
built-in charging station cable
management pass-throughs and it's been
recently updated to include a few little
improvements like better straps and a
larger laptop pocket check it out at the
link below now with a warehouse full of
computer cases you would think that
after spending hours searching we could
find something with bashir moxie and
space-age energy that we were looking
for but alas it was for naught so we set
out to do something that we surprisingly
never done before here at LTT design and
build our very own case from the ground
up so setting out to design this thing
we only had a few rough guidelines in
place we wanted it to look really cool
and Alex has been itching to play with
our new FUBU laser co2 laser cutter from
smart DIY so our design team immediately
came up with some wild and crazy ideas
for complex polyhedrons and ornate
acrylic paneling that would fit our
overall theme after all when it comes to
imagination the sky is the limit right
no actually the limit is something
called international copyright law which
is why our decorative inscriptions are
in Klingon not Arabic so after much
internal debate and many failed attempts
here's how our final design ended up
coming together or at least we wish it
was that easy we constructed our case
from the bottom up which meant putting
together a wooden frame now wood isn't
exactly first-choice material when it
comes to computer cases but we aren't
quite ready to try our hands at
fabricating a metal frame yet so we
attached wooden pillars to a small sheet
of MDF then we made holes for inserts
for motherboard standoffs and a much
larger hole for the GPU next we needed a
starter hole for the GPU i/o then to get
a nice clean cut we picked up a brand
new handsaw that totally ended up
sucking so the hole looks super ragged
but
since it's on the bottom of the case no
one will ever see it provided of course
that there was nobody standing around
with a camera filming the whole thing
the motherboard standoffs went in a lot
more smoothly and we elevated them on
these big screws so we would have
somewhere to tuck our cables after
putting on the motherboard and ROG Strix
Z 370 I mini ITX board we added our CPU
an Intel Core i7 8700 k-6 core processor
pretty much the best of the best for
gaming right now and 16 gigs of DDR for
RAM then for cooling our first choice
was a bit quiet dark rock pro 3 tower
cooler but unfortunately even with low
profile ram we were unable to
successfully mount the tower so it looks
like it's knocked to it to the rescue
now the centerpiece of this build is our
Star Wars Titan XP graphics card so we
opted to give it a full frontal mount
which is not nearly as dirty as it
sounds it just means that we used a PCI
Express extension to mount it in a
vertical position front and center right
here now let's see how it might look
with some paneling well luckily a hasty
modification can rectify that problem
now we're not going to leave the frame
showing exposed wood so we also need to
give the whole thing a quick coat of
paint then once we've got all the
hardware loaded into our mark to frame
we can get to the most important part of
any kickass case build adding the RGB
with all the strips in place it's time
to close it up but first let's get a
nice good look at just how awesome that
setup is looking as mentioned earlier we
used our faboo laser cutter to create
our non-infringing designs and aside
from a few minor hiccups that process
was relatively painless so after another
finishing touch and some decorative
molding around the outside yeah now
we're looking good
once it was built though we had to put
it through the paces I mean you have a
good idea based on the hardware you put
in of how something like this is gonna
perform but what's the point of owning a
rowboat if you never ride it does one
write a rowboat not really the point
anyway
the thermals aren't quite as good as we
might expect from an NHD 15 so it is a
little toasty in there but our core i7
8,700 case still managed to turbo to 4
gigahertz on all six cores with temps in
the mid 70s and gaming wise this thing
is a beast churning through even the
latest triple-a titles as you would
expect a Titan XP to do and remember
this is all in a case that was really
not made with thermals in mind so in the
end we love the results but we feel like
in the future we've still got a lot of
work to do for as the Klingon proverb
teaches load up la la da la la love it
