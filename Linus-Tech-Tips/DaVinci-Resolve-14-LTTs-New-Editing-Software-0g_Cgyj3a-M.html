NAB 2017 coverage learn more about the
MKE two elements gopro microphone and
their other audio for video products at
the link in the video description we're
here at NAB 2017 and Wow
there's this enormous ad for DaVinci
Resolve 14 on the side of the southern
Convention Center this is actually a
pretty big deal DaVinci Resolve has
always been geared towards professional
color grading but with this new update
they've added a ton of new features for
both video and audio editing you can see
the complete list on the blackmagic
forums and you can already download the
free public beta which has some
limitations when compared to the full
studio version which has gone down in
price to $300 I took a four-hour
training course today and there's
definitely a lot of cool stuff in
resolve but and I hate to admit this as
an NLE it's still not as feature-rich as
Adobe Premiere and there are still
plenty of bugs to fix like this one
where audio playback simply does not
work at all nevertheless I'm going to
start using DaVinci Resolve 14 on my
home computer while sending feedback and
feature requests through the forums if
they fix the bugs and continue to add
more awesome features we just might
switch Lynas media group over to DaVinci
Resolve frankly I'm tired of all the
bugs crashes and missing features in
Premiere Pro if you don't know what I'm
talking about
I do have a 215 line spreadsheet and a
3-hour long playlist that goes into
extreme detail about it speaking of
which at the Adobe booth they were
showing off some of the new features in
Premiere Pro 20 17.1 like essential
audio and essential graphics which
definitely looks like an improvement
over the legacy title ER tool I've
always said there's not enough
competition in the MLE market space so
I'm glad that Blackmagic has really
stepped up their game as a video editor
I'm really looking forward to seeing
what the future holds thanks again to
San Heiser for sponsoring our coverage
of nab 2017
