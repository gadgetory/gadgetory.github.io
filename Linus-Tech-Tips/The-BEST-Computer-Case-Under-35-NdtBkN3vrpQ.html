best bang for the buck round ups for the
super budget-conscious lately and today
that dollar menu gravy train keeps on
below and baby you've got your cheap
gaming peripherals already which means
now it's time to start building your
cheap gaming PC so we teamed up with
Newegg to test seven of the best rated
cases on their site for under 35 bucks
before sale or rebate pricing so tax
Magnus en 1070 mini gaming PC comes VR
and triple-a game ready check it out now
at the link below
we'll be judging the cases in order of
their popularity on newegg.com based on
three main metrics one compatibility how
much can we comfortably stuff inside
are there any component size limitations
to take into account to performance does
the case have air flow issues how many
fans can you mount can you mount a
radiator and three injury factor
are there any sharp edges how much slack
on sliced open is it awkwardly top-heavy
oh and actually for a 10% bonus extras
and aesthetics
these aren't necessities at this kind of
a price but they're certainly nice to
have so first up is the micro ATX Zion
x3 10 BK it's the most popular case in
our roundup and it's certainly the
cheapest at just $23 but that maybe it's
only selling point it's pretty sharp
looking it includes a USB 3 port it's
sturdy enough and it's extremely
lightweight but installing anything but
a mini sized graphics card is a carnival
of frustration and sadness and oh yeah
there's this thing the screw retaining
it is on the inside and it just swings
out of place to install a card
also while the Box claims that it has
five and a quarter inch bays there mi a
but the rails are there making usable
space so tight that it's almost
impossible to mount the power supply and
cable management was even worse the
cables just kind of hang out at the
bottom of the case and there's no top or
side ventilation thermal performance is
utter balls there's nowhere for the heat
or even air to go not recommended we'd
actually prefer a milk crate off eBay
and some zip ties instead next up is the
full ATX large assists es350 BK which is
both solidly built and thoughtfully laid
out
for a design from 2003 to its credit it
comes with a power supply but the claim
that it can handle three hundred and
thirty watts of total continuous load is
probably bull this thing won't be
powering anything north of a GTX 1050 Ti
and even for that I wouldn't recommend
it now the case is rolled edges help
with preventing injury but they aren't
totally pinched off and there's also
these break off PCI slot covers and a
rear i/o shield to contend with
otherwise there is plenty of space in
here which is good but there's nowhere
to throw cables so managing them is a
chore the aesthetics of the case other
than the glossy plastic are fairly
inoffensive so that also is good but
with only a single intake fan for
cooling this case pulled off some of the
worst thermals in this group and that is
saying a lot not recommended our third
most popular case is the micro ATX
Zalman t3 it's a little cramped to work
in but it's also the first in our
roundup so far with a semi reasonable
modern layout the edges are pretty
smooth and the overall fit and finishes
oh the reset buttons mushy and this is
starting to look like a pattern here
actually there is only one USB 3 port on
the front panel again rather than the
two supported by the motherboard header
I mean I guess copper prices are going
up geez you guys building in it though
was mostly painless the hard drives can
only be accessed by removing the front
panel for some reason but the two and a
half inch SSD mounts are easily
accessible and there's actually quite a
nice amount of cable management room
behind the back panel there's no
included radiator mount but up top you
will actually find cutouts for use with
an external radiator an old feature that
dates the core design here a little bit
it's a touch game relooking but overall
this case has pretty excellent thermals
mesh covered fan mounts and clean cable
management recommended on
to the Compu case Voyager where is the
Voyager going somewhere far away I hope
this is a MIDI computer case that I
would raid a net D out of 10 on its
looks alone the front panel is adorned
with brightly colored headphone and mic
jacks straight out of 2005 the power
button kind of looks like a cigarette
lighter and when your PC freezes you can
call team rocket with this button right
here inside isn't much to write home
about either it's a very early 2000
style with a top mounted power supply
taste the rainbow style front panel
cables and very little room for cable
management to hide them there aren't
really any sharp edges but with these
breakaway PCI slot covers and it's thin
metal construction you'll be creating
your own soon enough drive bays line the
entire front of the chassis which means
that you will need a dremel for a large
high-performance graphics card not that
you should be putting any decent gear in
here anyway our CPU got super toasty
without a fresh supply of cool air not
recommended in the number five spot is
the apex sk3 and you know what who cares
it doesn't matter I'm calling this one
the disappointment not only does it look
like a 2005 piece of steel junk it's got
so many sharp edges that I had to dish
out hazard pay to the unlucky sod who
built the system in it in any way there
is nowhere for cables to hide so have
fun with that the PCI slot covers are
tear off without a tab to which a
screwdriver into so you'll be using your
hands and while there's a 120mm fan
mount in the front of the case and an
80/90 to mount in the rear both of them
are unoccupied by default so out of the
box the power supply acts as the main
exhaust this thing's an oven not
recommended Wow
most of these sucks so far next up is
the DIY PC Jack's 12 BK witch ha
actually doesn't look too bad it's got a
nice clean aesthetic as long as you're
into pandas a single USB 3 port on the
front panel with a twin USB 2.0 to boot
and on the inside it's even got a shroud
to hide the power supply and three and a
half inch bays and you can see them
through a nice wide acrylic window the
full ATX layout is as open as you could
want with SSD mounts to the right of the
motherboard and I mean really all we're
missing here is a radiator mount and
some topside ventilation both of which
can be remedied with a dremel and some
time the construction is sturdy though
with rolled and smooth edges throughout
and we've also got a huge area in the
rear for hiding all of the junk in the
trunk it's not an ideal config the
breakaway slot covers are a good example
of this as is the minimal clearance
about the motherboard but it is leagues
better than everything else we've seen
so far and perhaps unsurprisingly then
its thermal performance is pretty good
too with 120mm fans on the front and
rear complementing its wide-open
interior highly recommended finally
we've got the Cougar
the cougar mg 110 another micro ATX case
we've got single USB 3 and USB 2 ports
on the front and on the rear we got
those blasted breakaway PCI brackets on
the interior though we've got smooth
edges all around and it looks like that
five and a quarter inch bay is - Liz -
with a nice little handle labeled gaming
we've got a 120 ml case fan
pre-installed on the rear and we even
get space on this one for a 2 by 120 mil
radiator on the top if you remove the
yes removable optical drive mount
there's also a removable three and a
half inch hard drive tray and a decently
sized area in the rear panel for cable
management complete with management
points and two and a half inch SSD
mounts thermal performance was actually
stellar - owing to the clean interior
and decent placement of the exhaust fan
and copious ventilation holes
recommended
again so overall then what we learned
today
is that the one with the most votes
might not actually be the best choice in
all cases the Cougar mg1 10 was the best
case overall an hour pick for an M ATX
build with the Jax 12 over here creaming
the rest of the competition if you've
got a full sized ATX board the Zalman t3
then gets an honorable mention for
sucking a lot less than the rest of them
and as for the rest of them
the Sennheiser 5 8x from mass drop uses
Sennheiser's new 150 ohm drivers making
these headphones easier to power from
devices like your cell phone then their
predecessors the emphasis of this
particular set is on clean extended bass
with a smooth but clear upper range
they've got soft velour earpads with
elliptical ear cups that I know it's
crazy
follow the anatomy of the ear round on
an ear I don't know where that idea ever
came from but not with these they come
with a handy detachable cable and
they're available now on mass drop for
