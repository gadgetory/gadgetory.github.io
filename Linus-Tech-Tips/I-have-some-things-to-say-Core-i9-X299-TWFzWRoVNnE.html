to you by the Corsair 1 and synergy you
can check them out at the link in the
video description I have been
conspicuously silent about Intel's new
high end desktop X $2.99 platform and
the CPUs that they just announced
to go with it and this was on purpose
but probably not for the reasons that
you think I've spent the last few days
walking the show floor chatting with
industry folks and generally trying to
wrap my head around what the actual hell
it is that Intel's trying to do with
this launch before we get into that
though a primer on X 299 so socket 2011
v3 is old news socket 20 66 is the hot
new girl in class with the new chipset
come support for up to seven series
skylake based Intel Core i nine
processors we get up to quad-channel
ddr4 memory running at up to ddr4 26 66
megahertz we get up to 44 PCI Express
Lanes for massive expansion up to
greatly expanded nvme and obtain storage
capabilities and up to 2 preferred turbo
max cores that run at higher boost
frequencies well what's with all this up
to I'll get to that first let's take a
look at the board's so intel's partners
have been out in full force with support
for this new tech a since we're showing
about half a dozen boards based on the
same basic DNA each with some standout
features the rampage fix extreme
includes dual water flow sensors to go
with the pump headers that are standard
on this generation their Deluxe board
includes 802.11 80 multi gigabit
Wireless and an OLED postin system
monitoring display and the tough smart
one comes with in the usual extra
thermal sensors tough armor and the
freaking graphics card sag holder
gigabytes digital RGB header allows
lighting effects with individually
addressable LED strips they are smart
fan 5 software now allows fans to be
turned off outright if system
temperatures allow it a huge boom to
silence freaks like me
they've gone ham on USB 3.1 10 gigabit
ports including like the others support
for the new type-c front panel spec and
they were showing off for PCIe nvme SSDs
running in raid which in and of itself
isn't exactly groundbreaking but the
fact that they were running off of the
CPU and they were bootable is MSI on the
subject of nvme has boards with native
support for up to 5 m dot two SSDs and
is putting a really strong emphasis on
cooling for them like everyone else
they've given a lot of thought to the
aesthetics of their board you can even
3d print accessories from template and
swap cooler covers in some cases and
unlike everybody else this is
interesting they've got a white or red
LED that tells you what kind of CPU
you've got installed and in turn that
how many of the features that you're
looking at on the board are actually
going to be enabled which I guess brings
us to a fairly natural conclusion to the
nicely scripted part of this video
because I've got some rough notes for
some other stuff that I've got to get
off my back
but to do that I think it's probably
better if we go for a little walk going
back to my earlier question what what is
this platform quite honestly what it
looks like to me is that Intel
themselves can't really decide it's like
they've changed their mind multiple
times and the whole thing just seems
like this this knee-jerk reaction to
AMD's announcement of they're up to 16
core 32 threads thread Ripper platform
and then I mean some of the things
they're doing look just kind of like a
1/2 desperate attempt to appease
enthusiasts and gamers who if they feel
anything like me we're you know the
mainstream has been stuck with quad-core
processors for the last 10 years and
even on the enthusiast level we're lucky
to get another 2 cores and last time
around we even had to pay another $700
just for the privilege of going from 8
to 10 course with the new Broadwell II
generation I mean to be clear for me
personally a lot of this stuff can only
be good I mean high core count
overclockable water-cooled servers that
that's right in my wheelhouse that's
perfect and when you're someone who
doesn't pay for hardware then it's
expensive no problem I mean not to
mention that as a hardware enthusiast
I'm not going to be struggling to pair
the correct board and the correct memory
and the correct TPU together to make
sure that I'm getting the most out of
the entire platform cause honestly
that's one of the biggest problems with
a platform right now it's really
confusing K V Lake X muddies the water
in a way that just makes absolutely no
sense for Intel to do I mean I've spoken
to system integrators here at the show
I'm not going to name them by name or
anything but they flat out said we're
not going to support this this aspect of
the platform is a mess because what is
kV Lake acts like on the surface it
sounds like they've gone ahead and
they've added the latest architecture to
this platform in some you know amazing
Wow we engineered a new generation
overnight kind of way but what actually
happened was they took the existing
cable 8 processors on the main stream
platform and just like they pulled the
lawn to socket 2066 the only difference
between the 7740 and the 7640 compared
to the socket 1151 versions is that
they're rated at 20
hired TDPS their cloths a hundred
megahertz higher and Intel is promising
better overclocking on them but at the
end of the day am I going to spend
another hundred dollars on a board just
for that and why on earth would Intel
neuter
all the features on the motherboard just
for the sake of me being able to run a
chip at like a little bit higher
frequency they don't have four PCI
Express Lanes they still only got
sixteen and making matters even more
confusing they only run dual channel
memory still so when you go and you buy
an X $2.99 motherboard it can have
anywhere from four to eight memory slots
on it which might support two sets of
dual channel memory a single set of quad
channel memory or two sets of quad
channel memories so you might actually
have bin slots that don't work if you
install a KT like XE to you oh and I
mean right this is crazy too I even
forgot the part how X $2.99 boards
aren't going to have all the connectors
for onboard graphics so the onboard
graphics are fused off which wouldn't
inherently be a huge problem I expect
someone spending you know 300 to 600
dollars on a motherboard to buy a
dedicated graphics card but the issue is
that then you can even use features that
you would be able to on the mainstream
platform like quick sync for example
that rely on the integrated GPU in order
to function
KDH just makes no sense at all okay so
now let's talk about those reactionary
hike or count CPUs again I'm not
complaining an 18 Core Extreme Edition
that's overclockable sounds great to me
but everyone in there dog knows that
Intel was only planning to use the low
core count version of their xeon
processors to create their high-end
desktop platform so that was going to be
up to 12 cores
and surprise surprise here at the show
the only tips they're showing are based
on that one
so what Intel did is they saw Ono AMD
has
red gripper there they're making us look
bad by announcing this stuff that people
really want a quick announce something
even though you know we don't know how
much power it's going to consume we
don't know what clock speeds is going to
run at we don't know how much we're
going to charge for it we just we need
to make sure we're announcing something
so that when AMD launches thread Ripper
we're not caught completely with our
pants down and no way to react to it but
here's the problem they're taking this
wait-and-see approach for a reason that
I personally don't really like they want
to see what thread Ripper turns into
before they commit to what they're going
to deliver to the consumer and that's
exactly the problem that they're running
up against in the first place here
here's some corporate strategy advice
free of charge and help build the best
thing you can for the best price that
you can deliver it and you're not going
to get blindsided by a competitor that
walks in and delivers something way
better for a lower price so we've got
this really confusing platform we've got
these these mid core counts
harvested Zeon's on the high end desktop
platform that are going to be
differentiated by having lots of PCI
Express Lanes
which i think is what gives them the
core i9 designation we're going to have
the normal chip some of which still have
lots of PCI Express Lanes and go up to
12 cores all of the ones I've mentioned
so far support quad channel memory and
anywhere from 28 to 44 PCI Express Lanes
then we're going to have KB Lake X which
only supports 16 PCI Express lanes and
get this the motherboard manufacturers
have to support any chip that you could
put in the socket on every single board
how do you build a board around 16 to 44
PCI Express Lanes dual to quad channel
memory and anywhere from 4 to 18 cores
the whole launch is so rushed that
gigabyte flat-out isn't supporting
Thunderball
three on any of their ex 299 boards
because they didn't have time to go
through the certification process and
the whole thing is confusing as hell too
not just the general consumer but even
enthusiasts and I mean there's other
stuff here that just makes no sense to
me as well be Rock okay so I talked
about how you can have you know up to
you know better support for nvme storage
than ever before so this is a really
cool feature you can actually run
bootable raid through the CPU rather
than letting it get bottlenecks by the
chipset now with nvme devices but out of
the box Intel is only supporting raid
zero and if you want to run raid 1 or
raid 10 you need to buy a $99 physical
key and plug it into the board and if
you want to support raid 5 on top of all
that other stuff you're going to pay
another $300 like I get that they're
worried about cannibalizing there's V on
sales and their server and high-end
workstation sales with this platform but
this seems like such a step backwards on
a consumer product going back to buying
like rain cheese and sticking them onto
a motherboard and as if that wasn't an T
consumer enough the word on the street
now and I really hope they reverse this
decision if it is one is that this
bootable raise this be Rock feature is
only going to work with Intel branded
nvme SSDs they don't make the best nvme
SSDs at least not till octane lands so
they're basically going out here's the
highest end you know enthusiast thing oh
by the way put some you know SSDs in
here for your wicked raid array that
aren't even the best on the market so
I'm sorry if this video was a little
more rambley than what I usually do and
maybe a little longer than what I do
these days but I guess it just felt
appropriate given the
the frustration that I've had I mean you
know I've been asking for higher core
count and I've been you know asking for
really a lot of the things that they're
doing right now which like it's funny
because here I am complaining about it
but what's frustrating is not that
they're doing it what's frustrating is
my perception of the reasons that
they're doing it so I guess that's
pretty much it like leave a comment
letting me know your guys's thought am I
am I being nitpicky or are the
criticisms fair leave a comment below
and let's let's at least talk about it
if Intel is going to come across this
video I'd love for them to get some real
feedback not just for me but also from
you guys so thanks for watching this
video here from Computex 2017 and
beautiful Taiwan a huge shout out to
Corsair for allowing us to be here the
Corsair one is their 12 liter powerhouse
