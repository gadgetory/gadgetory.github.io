quick look at the d-link dgs-3627 is
downloading files somewhere else on your
network and you are gaming it should in
theory prioritize those gaming packets
over all of the other stuff that's going
on so let me see includes world of
conflict content oh this is actually
interesting it is a gigabit router so
you do pay a bit of a premium but if you
bought both extreme and wireless and
gigabit then it's pretty important to
find at the high end router I mean
personally I wouldn't settle for
anything less than gigabit these days
especially with the way that the cost
has calmed down it also features dual
technology so your router has the power
of dual been two point four or five
gigahertz wireless signals to get your
game on in the wireless band of your
choice now I'm not a huge fan of gaining
on wireless and you can actually check
out the full NCIX tech tips episode we
did on wireless versus wired vs
powerline and i'm a big powerline using
these days but that doesn't mean that
wireless doesn't still have its use and
that you wouldn't still want draft in
for example or a rather ni should call
it because maybe you have a laptop and
you want to stream HD content and makes
a huge difference for that so let's see
what we got inside first of all here is
your start insert CD and run wizard i'm
just going to ignore that phone call
sorry about that okay and then there is
a disc i can't imagine any reason you
would ever use an installation CD for a
router it makes zero sense to me and
I've never put one in my computer maybe
there's something useful but whatever
okay it's your internet so take charge
okay
some kind of ad all right then you've
got a quick install guide alright so the
quick install guide is pretty much a
world and conflict poster there you go
okay and it has the router at the bottom
of it leg is no longer an excuse okay
and then on the other side that is where
the quick install guide actually comes
in so here what's funny about the quick
install guide oh this is awesome is
there is no step that requires you to
put that CD yeah ok so the CD includes a
manual and a router setup wizard okay
there you go so it shows you how to set
it up okay okay so next we will find an
AC adapter nothing particularly exciting
about that and then we have three huge
2.4 / 5 gigahertz labeled antennas which
we can plug into the back of the router
so you can see these are like the huge
bulky kind there we go then we have a
little stand for standing the router up
on its side if you don't want to run it
as like a desktop router and switch okay
hold on we've got a cat 5e cable yeah
that's cat 5e I think yeah whatever
doesn't really matter and then a couple
of screws for I think this is for wall
mounting it or something oh and it has
little rubber feet for propping it up on
the desk I guess I know it comes with
rubber feet I can't imagine what those
are for now the camera man's phones
ringing use of this device may make your
wireless network connect okay this is a
good morning to see they give you a
quick warning and show you how to go to
their support site to set up your
wireless for wpa2 security which is
really important because you don't want
someone for example tapping into your
wireless connection to download illegal
content or something like that and then
you end up blamed for it so I mean that
kind of thing is pretty bad news I mean
it's one of those things where yeah
people aren't supposed to do that but
the same people who aren't supposed to
download anything illegal are the ones
who are doing that right so here's where
the LCD screen is and these buttons are
used for navigating through it I have
one of these at home and honestly the
screen is totally useless you should be
using the the web GUI based web
interface to configure the router
192.168 point zero point one here is a
reset button okay it's kind of nice to
see that that's oh no that's not a reset
okay I have no idea what this button
does sorry
okay then we've got the other side and
then we're around at the back so here's
where we plug in our antennas and you
can see we've got four gigabit lan ports
so there's a gigabit switch built in and
then you've also got your internet
uplink port right there that USB port I
believe can be used as a print server
among other things and the firmware
updates are actually done in a really
smart way on this router it's really
nice you just go into the to the router
configuration screen and then you just
tell it go update and it does it it's
really seamless I mean a lot of routers
out there you have to like download it
to a USB key and then plug it in and
then upload it and it's very strange
anyway thank you for checking out my
unboxing and quick product oh it's shiny
we should do the shiny shot yeah don't
go away yet see see how shiny it is
actually it gets scratched up really
fast there's like nothing you can do
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the DGL 4500</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
