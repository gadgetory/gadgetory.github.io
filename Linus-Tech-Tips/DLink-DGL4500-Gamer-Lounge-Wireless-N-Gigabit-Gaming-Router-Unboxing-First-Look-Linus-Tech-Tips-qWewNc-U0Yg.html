quick look at the d-link DGL 4500 so
this is from their gamer lounge series
of networking products and that means
that it is optimized for weight for it
gaming yes okay awesome so that means
that the gaming feature it seems to have
over its cousin the DW dir-655 is that
it has an LCD on the top and it also
features game fuel priorities so let's
have a look at the back of the box and
see what we can find in terms of
information about this router powered by
game feel nothing Rian's a frag that's
faster than leg basically what game fuel
does is it prioritizes gaming packets
over something like your roommates
favorite 80s hair band music so if
someone else is downloading files
somewhere else on your network and you
are gaming it should in theory
prioritize those gaming packets over all
of the other stuff that's going on so
let me see includes world of conflict
content oh this is actually interesting
it is a gigabit router so you do pay a
bit of a premium but if you bought both
extrema and wireless and gigabit then
it's pretty important to find at the
high end better I mean personally I
wouldn't settle for anything less than
gigabit these days especially with the
way that the cost has come down
it also features dual technology so your
router has the power of dual band 2.0
four or five gigahertz wireless signals
to get your game on in the wireless band
of your choice now I'm not a huge fan of
gaming on wireless and you can actually
check out the full NCIX tech tips
episode we did on wireless versus wired
vs. powerline and I'm a big powerline
users these days but that doesn't mean
that Wireless doesn't still have it to
use some that you wouldn't still want
draft in for example or rather n I
should call it because maybe you have a
laptop and you want to stream HD content
and makes a huge difference for that so
let's see what we got inside first of
all here is your start insert CD and run
wizard I'm just going to ignore that
phone call sorry about that okay and
then there is a disc I can't imagine any
reason you would ever use an
installation CD for a router it makes
zero sense to me and I've never put one
in my computer
maybe there's something useful but
whatever okay it's your internet so take
charge okay so
some kind of ad all right then you've
got a quick install guide all right so
the quick install guide is pretty much a
world and conflict poster there you go
okay and it has the router at the bottom
of it
leg is no longer an excuse okay and then
on the other side that is where the
quick install guide actually comes in so
here what's funny about the quick
install guide oh this is awesome
is there is no step that requires you to
put that CD in okay so the CD includes a
manual and a router setup wizard okay
there you go so it shows you how to set
it up okay okay so next we will find an
AC adapter nothing particularly exciting
about that and then we have three huge
2.4 slash five gigahertz labeled
antennas which we can plug in to the
back of the router so you can see these
are like the huge bulky kind there we go
then we have a little stand for standing
the router up on its side if you don't
want to run it as like a desktop router
and switch okay hold on we've got a cat
5e cable yeah that's a cat 5e I think
yeah whatever it doesn't really matter
and then a couple of screws for I think
this is for wall mounting it or
something oh and it has little rubber
feet for propping it up on the desk I
guess oh no it comes with rubber feet I
can't imagine what those are for another
camera man's phone ringing used to this
device may make your wireless network
connect okay this is a good morning to
see they give you a quick warning and
show you how to go to their support site
to set up your wireless for wpa2
security which is really important
because you don't want someone for
example tapping into your wireless
connection to download illegal content
or something like that and then you end
up flamed for it so I mean that kind of
thing is pretty bad news I mean it's one
of those things where yeah people aren't
supposed to do that
but the same people who aren't supposed
to download anything illegal are the
ones who are doing that right so here's
where the LCD screen is and these
buttons are used for navigating through
it I have one of these at home and
honestly the screen is totally useless
you should be using the the web GUI
based web interface to configure the
router 192.168.0.1 here is a reset
button okay it's kind of nice to see
that that oh no that's not a reset okay
I have no idea what this button does
sorry
okay then we've got the other side and
then we're around at the back so here's
where we plug in our antennas and you
can see we've got four Gigabit LAN ports
so there's a gigabit switch built in and
then you've also got your internet
uplink port right there
that USB port I believe can be used as a
print server among other things and the
firmware updates are actually done in a
really smart way on this router it's
really nice you just go into the to the
router configuration screen and then you
just tell it go update and it does it
it's really seamless I mean a lot of
routers out there you have to like
download it to a USB key and then plug
it in and then upload it and it's very
strange anyway thank you for checking
out my unboxing and quick product oh
it's shiny we should do the shiny shot
yeah don't go away yet see see how shiny
it is actually it gets scratched up
really fast there's like nothing you can
do thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the DGL 4500</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
