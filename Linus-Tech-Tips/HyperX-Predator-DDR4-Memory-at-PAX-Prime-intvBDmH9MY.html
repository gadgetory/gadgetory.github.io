to you by HyperX gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device hey
guys we are finally here at PAX Prime
after the long drive down and the first
booth we wanted to stop by was the
HyperX booth they've got tons of stuff
here from headphones to stick on mouse
pads to memory but what I'm really
excited about is memory I think that's
what a lot of people at this convention
are excited about this year right here
we have 16 gigs of DDR for predator'
memory running at 3,000 megahertz pretty
beast they I was wondering why they
actually released their predator first
and I talked to them about it and they
said that's because with the new
enthusiast platform they expect people
to want really high-end memory right out
the gate if you're buying this platform
right off the bat it's gonna be really
expensive so you're expecting to buy
really nice components throw the entire
computer so they're releasing what
predator that makes a lot of sense I'm
not too surprised at doing that later on
in the show we're hopefully gonna be
able to check out their overclocking
station that will come later though
because the guy is still overclocking
the RAM right now as we speak so we'll
check that out later in the show but
this should be the first video you see
so that won't be in this right yet so
far you should also subscribe to the
HyperX youtube channel you can click a
button that will be somewhere on the
screen I don't really know where because
I'm not gonna make the annotation so
anywhere around here subscribe to their
channel it's really good they've doubled
in subscribers in the last month I think
and their philosophy on that channel is
to actually make really good content not
just like look we released a new product
which is what I see from a lot of
different manufacturers channels so it
should be pretty interesting be sure to
check that out also thank you to phantom
glass you're saying us here this year
I'm excited to check out a whole bunch
of stuff so watch all the pax videos and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
