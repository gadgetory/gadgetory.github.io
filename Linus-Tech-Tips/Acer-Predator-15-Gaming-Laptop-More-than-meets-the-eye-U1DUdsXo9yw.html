yet another high-end gaming laptop with
a top-of-the-line NVIDIA GPU and Intel
processor this time it's the Acer
predator 15 specifically the G 9 v 9 174
kn well compared against other competing
gaming laptops in terms of raw
performance so stay tuned to see how it
stacks up
the Scimitar RGB from Coursera features
17 programmable buttons a 12,000 dpi
optical sensor and a shape design for
comfort in MMO and mobile gaming learn
more in the link in the description down
below sitting on top of the lid there's
a snazzy looking predator logo and name
with a pair of red LED bars on the sides
there is also an Acer logo visible on
the bottom area that is fixed in place
as it's part of the main body and not
the back of the screen the main material
used here is a matte black plastic that
almost feels slightly rubbery to the
touch I personally like this a lot as
it's not glossy and cheesy looking like
glossy plastic and it won't look bad
over time like brushed aluminum the
bottom of the unit features a bunch of
venting near the back for rubber feet
that help the venting breathe by getting
it up off of whatever surface it's on
and to help the laptop stay in place by
gripping said surface there's a red
subwoofer that is a part of the predator
sound pound 2.1 audio system that
features doli surround and there's a
sliding latch that releases your blu-ray
drive why the hell would you want to
quickly release your blu-ray drive well
just in case you want to install the
predator frost core basically you turn
your laptop off pop the optical drive
out pop the Coolermaster designed
predator frost core in and now you have
a third fan instead of an optical drive
which you probably wouldn't have been
using is it cool yes
is it effective kinda no major changes
but in Crysis 3 skybox load test it did
bring the temperature down of the CPU
and GPU by one degree each nothing to
break into song and dance over but
definitely something I'm happy to see I
wish they also included a like predator
Drive core or something where you could
mount an additional two and a half inch
drive that absolutely would have been
kind of cool it's been done before but
it would have been kind of cool under
the hood it's rocking a shiny i7 6700 HQ
Intel processor which turbos up to 3.5
gigahertz and NVIDIA 980m
32 gigs of ram for all your browser tab
needs killer 1535 AC Wi-Fi and a Gigabit
Ethernet alongside Bluetooth 4.1 a 6,000
milliamp hour battery which
claimed six hours of battery runtime a
one terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive and a
512 gigabyte nvme SSD which is like
crazy
not only because nvme drives are super
freakin fast and totally awesome check
out this video to see just how much more
powerful these drives are but it's also
crazy because they don't really tell you
it has one on the website it just says
solid-state drive no other information
on any part of the page on the box it
states that it's a PCIe SSD which isn't
wrong but it also doesn't properly claim
the awesome power that is nvme anyways
moving on on the left side other than
the derivative frost cooler there's an
SD card slot - 3.5 millimeter audio
jacks for headphone and microphone and a
dual USB 3.0 ports on the right hand
side there are two USB 3.0 ports a
Thunderbolt 3.0 port hdmi displayport
killer gigabit ethernet port and a
Kensington lock slot where your hands go
there's a wonderful chiclet keyboard
with four lighting zones and cool
outlined WASD buttons just above the
keyboard there's five macro keys and a
profile button which allows you to swap
between three profile groups for a total
of effectively 15 possible hotkeys the
touchpad is nicely sized and has a
noticeable ridge around it and separate
buttons so you can easily find your way
around without needing to look down
which I super definitely like just up in
to the right of the touchpad is a toggle
button to turn off or on said touchpad
just in case you're plugging in a mouse
and don't want the touchpad to randomly
decide to send pointer inputs when
you're just trying to type or whatever
also a cool feature the screen itself is
a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS comfy view panel
which has a little bit too much bezel
around it for my liking what suits the
laptop quite well regardless the panel
does not support g-sync despite a
sticker that says g-sync on it if you
look a little bit closer in the slightly
smaller print you'll notice that it
states monitor support meaning that if
you plug in a g-sync monitor it will
function as intended
performance-wise we compared it against
the Asus g7 51 the review of which you
can also see up here under the hood the
G Sun 51 has the same 980m
BPU an older model i 747 10 HQ and a
little bit more weight near the back in
the form of bigger heat sinks it's also
considerably cheaper but that can
probably be blamed on that massive super
badass nvme Drive in terms of power draw
from the wall and battery Jane when not
plugged into the wall both during our
crisis 3 skybox test the predator 15
dominated from wall it drew 29 watts
less than the G sub 50 1 and during the
battery drain test it lost 4 percent
less over 16 minutes of gameplay which
is actually pretty significant for
temperatures the G 751 consistently had
better CPU temperatures with the
predator including the not so impactful
frost core installed having better GPU
temperatures moving on to game
performance there's a bit of trading
blows that went on here when looking at
battery power game performance the
predator wins by 5 fps in both
battlefront and Crysis 3 but loses by 3
in Tomb Raider when plugged into the
wall however they tie in Crysis 3 with
the predator losing by 4 in Tomb Raider
and three in battlefront ok so that's
all fine and good but what are the
takeaways here well I think there's
three main ones if you want to no
compromises compared to a desktop
performance laptop and don't mind
hauling around basically a bag of bricks
maybe check out the sager that we
reviewed up here it's a similar price
point to the predator but not nearly as
elegant if you want great gaming
performance and don't mind lugging a bit
of extra weight but don't quite want to
call a bag of bricks and want to spend
some money but maybe not quite as much
as this guy of a shaker maybe check out
the g7 51 if you want a gaming laptop
that still managed to look sleek despite
the stereotype of big bulky gaming
laptops one that has beefs gaming
performance one that performs relatively
well on battery and has what has very
recently been a revolutionary storage
drive maybe check out the predator if
your bank account can take that big of a
hit mine cannot so I guess I'll keep
using the lioness hand-me-down laptop
that he gave me it swivels and stuff
whatever thanks for watching guys if
this video suck you know what to do it
