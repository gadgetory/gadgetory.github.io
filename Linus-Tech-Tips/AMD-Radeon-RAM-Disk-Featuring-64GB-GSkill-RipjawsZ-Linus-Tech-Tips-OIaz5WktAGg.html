something with a ram drive for quite a
while so check this out in this system
this is with a p9 x79 deluxe from isus
and 64 gigs of g.skill ripjaws z memory
so here i'm going to try and show you
guys in the is there we go can get in
there so this is an 1866 32 gig kit
times 2 it's rated at CL 9 and 1.5 volts
this is an extremely extremely binned
extremely high performance kit however
I'm running them at 1600 I haven't tried
them in 1866 because when you pair them
up sometimes you have to go a little bit
less aggressive on things so designed
for Intel LGA 2011 processors next 79
platforms so why would you need 64 gigs
of memory see there's the spec on that
right there so I've got eight sticks two
kits
why on earth would you need 64 gigs of
ram well if you're doing some really
hardcore 3d work I guess you could need
them obviously not for gaming so just so
that's real clear guys obviously not for
gaming hardcore 3d stuff hardcore video
editing really hardcore photo editing
there you go that's what the system
looks like with 64 gigs of RAM in it
sweet or an alternate use and this is
what I'm actually using it for is if you
wanted to set up our RAM Drive so I'm
going to show you guys how I used the
AMD software which you can get for just
a couple bucks it's actually not that
expensive it's called radeon ramdisk
radeon ramdisk configuration utility so
this just runs in the background nothing
out of the ordinary this is just a
branded this is just a branded Ram disk
software it's not actually developed by
AMD so here you go you set how much of
your memory oh yeah right I want to show
you guys so we've got a 39 60 X at 4
gigahertz in here it's you can't see
that because it's not actually under
load but don't worry about it
then we here we go to memory I guess you
can call it 65 gigs at this point
instead of 60
for gigs but there we go 1600 megahertz
nine nine nine twenty four command rate
two T 1.5 volts only so just block crazy
crazy crazy stuff look anyway so back to
the configuration utility so I set I set
aside forty eight gigs of memory as a
ram disk so what happens is when the
system loads up we load the disk image
off which is saved to the C Drive which
is an SSD then when the system shuts
down we save to that same image and we
can actually autosave it at any moment
it doesn't take that long to save so
I'll just show you guys how long it
takes to save it's not that bad and the
RAM disk is actually full now so I have
a whole whack load of games installed on
it as well as actually all that means
since I last saved it I have added
almost the full 50 gigs worth of stuff
so it might actually take a little while
I guess we're going to find out how long
it takes let the record show the time is
now 921 ok so here we go computer Ram
disk so I've loaded up 40 gigs of it
with a bunch of stuff including a few
Steam games as well as the full Adobe
cs6 master suite
so uh-huh that's what I meant to do oh
it's not letting me access it right now
because it's saving so I'll be back in a
moment let's find out how long that
takes that took about 10 minutes which
means that guys I will take a little
longer to shut down your computer than
normal and if you want to set up the
autosave option I would probably run a
separate disc for your RAM disk cache
like a small SSD maybe a 60 or 64 gig so
that you don't have to worry about the
slowdown on your boot drive while it's
doing it you can see that on your boot
drive I'm just saving to my boot drive
there's now a ram disk dot IMG that's an
image that takes up well the bulk of my
boot SSD now so here you can see also
though that I have a 46 gig ram disk
available with five about 6 gigs free
and the image only takes up around 41
gigs so it only uses as much space as
you're actually using on the ram disk to
cache it it doesn't just store blank
space as occupying your your boot SSD so
now that we've done this let's have a
look oh yeah I wanted to show you guys
where to get it as well so download
that's a different one radeon ramdisk so
you just go to radeon ramdisk comm and
you can see here they actually say this
is a data Ram product so it's just
rebranded you can get it for free for up
to four gigs of ram disk and if you have
AMD memory installed you can create up
to a six gig ram disk for for no extra
charge so that's pretty cool and then to
actually buy the software only cost a
few bucks i think it's twenty or but
twenty bucks or something like that yeah
not that bad
twenty bucks to get the full version
which allows you to create up to a 64
gig ram disk so that's what I'm using
the full version so let's do a couple
quick demos shall we let's go ahead and
close all the stuff down space sniffer
is awesome by the way you guys if you
aren't using it already you should
allows you to track down where all your
space is being used up so here is my
Steam Drive but here here's a cool demo
so I installed cs6 and we are going to
launch Photoshop cs6 64-bit here we go
boom done holy crap that was Photoshop I
don't mind this this is because I'm just
using a trial so that that doesn't count
that doesn't count in our load time so
let's go ahead just to make sure it
wasn't a fluke you know what here here
just to insure you that it wasn't a
fluke I'm going to fire up something
that I haven't opened yet Illustrator
cs6 and hey Lister oh shoot oh okay yeah
there we go they're mine
illustrator is open all right last but
not least Adobe Premiere so these are
all actually our office is installed on
a different drive so these are all
installed directly on the RAM drive so
Premiere Pro and I mean look at those
loading screens go done well okay it was
done but I exited it so now let's fire
up some Steam games so Crysis Crysis is
a good one because the load the saved
games actually take quite a while to
load now I don't know that I'm actually
saving the saved games to the RAM disk
but the game itself is loading off the
RAM disk so any textures or whatever
else are going to be able to load off of
that Ram disk come on game let's go go
Crysis
it's like yeah my system has you know 46
gigs of memory base storage and then the
joke is but but can it run Crysis
oh-ho-ho-ho oh okay I haven't seen him
do this before system just lock up
outright number lock not working we'll
be back alright so if you guys have
played crisis at all we're back by the
way took a little while got everything
working again if you've played prices at
all you have some idea that you know the
game takes a little while to load I mean
is it the difference between you know
not waiting for it to load at all and
waiting for it to load for you know
billion hours no but that is a lot
faster than I'm sure you guys have ever
seen a crisis game load because it is
loading off the rub which is very very
very cool so let's go ahead and sort of
can that of course everything is super
responsive because everything is running
off of RAM which is of course very fast
so we can go ahead and fire up another
game another game that I also enjoy the
long loading times of is the
elderscrolls v Skyrim so let's go ahead
and play the game see this is the thing
that kills me no matter how fast your
system is you're always going to wait
for stupid loading screens just freakin
ridiculous okay so let's find a game
loaded I think that's a test game yeah
yeah yeah whatever
and here we go so does the RAM Drive
make a difference the answer is
absolutely it does it definitely makes a
difference is it the difference between
you know your computer being usable and
your computer being totally not usable
no it is not however it's very very cool
ram is so cheap these days that it's not
necessarily a terrible upgrade and
honestly while i well i really like the
idea and while I really am sort of
enjoying the experience while I'm
playing around with it I wouldn't
necessarily recommend this particular
configuration where you actually have a
dedicated ram disk for the applications
that you use very frequently because
there's a couple things the number one
you saw me corrupt the RAM disk already
on my own here so there is the there's
the potential for things to go wrong so
I wouldn't use it for anything
mission-critical and number two is the
fact that it's just not that useful it
slows down your your shutdown it slows
down your boot up and you can't really
do anything with the stuff that's on
that drive until it's done whereas if
you were using it as a cache so there's
another there's another application
called fancy cache that is that is very
looks very cool as well because it
allows you to use that RAM disk to cache
your boot drive so you could actually
have instead of using an SSD to cache
your hard drive you could be using RAM
to cache your SSD which would obviously
be very very snappy so I think that
pretty much wraps this up I haven't
tried the other one yet although I've
heard very good things about it thank
you for checking out my sort of
performance test of what it's like to
run things off of a ram disk using like
a ludicrous amount of 64 gigs of g.skill
memory on my test bench and turn up the
gain here so you guys can actually see
