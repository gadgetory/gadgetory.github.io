unboxing something pretty new pretty
different and pretty unique today I will
be unboxing my new intro for Linus tech
tip so one of our artists here NCIX
worked very long and very hard on
creating this new intro along with music
and homemade sound effects and all that
good stuff and to announce the new intro
as a bit of a celebration plus the fact
that I never did anything when I hit
that 50,000 subscriber milestone a while
back and I did promise to do something
big I will be giving away a complete
gaming system so yes a complete gaming
system with oh okay let's just go ahead
and put this here box down go ahead and
get off the table I will be allowing you
to customize some components of this
gaming system but others will be
pre-configured for you it will include
an intel core i7 2600 k processor which
i will be cooling with a corsair k70 air
cooler with for heat pipes check out the
copper heatpipes it will be using an
asrock fatality p67 professional series
motherboard nice nice you guys like that
yeah yeah so far there's a pretty good
gaming system it will be using four gigs
of corsair dominator GT memory it will
have an msi gtx 560ti twin frozer to
graphics card I actually don't have it
here with me right now but i will be
using a 60 gig sandforce SSD for the
boot drive and a one terabyte western
digital green drive for storage i will
also be throwing in a mosque in 701 80
plus bronze power supply and your choice
of chassis so i will allow you to choose
between the NZXT
th2 if you want a more silent elegant
looking pc or the CM storm sniper and
for sir that i unboxed recently if you
want more of an aggressive gaming
looking pc the choice is actually
entirely up to you so what's the catch
guys the catch is that i need you to
leave the video response to the video
that I'm doing here announcing the
contest unboxing yourself video
submissions should be no longer than 30
seconds okay there longer than 30
seconds you guys are out this is open
only to residents of the US and canada
unfortunately due to the cost of
shipping a completed system I cannot
allow overseas entries but I want you
guys to be as creative as possible so
clearly putting yourself in a box and
opening it from the inside and popping
out of it isn't going to cut it since
I've already done that so I want you
guys to come up with some creative
interpretation of unboxed yourself
submit it as a video response and your
selection or rather your submissions
will be reviewed by myself the legendary
NCIX cameraman the crazy russian the pc
configurator here at NCIX as well as our
artists who helped me with this new
intro which you will now find at the
beginning of all linus tech tips videos
so don't forget to subscribe you can't
win if you're not subscribed and good
luck winning this rocking gaming PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
