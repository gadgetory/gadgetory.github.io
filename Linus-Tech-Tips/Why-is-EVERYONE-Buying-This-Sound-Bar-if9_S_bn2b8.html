files with high fidelity multi-speaker
surround setups there have been scrubs
who are fully satisfied with the
speakers that came built into their TVs
but then in the early 2000s a curious
thing happened a middle-class appeared
the scrubs started buying sound bars the
first sound bar came about in 1998 and
since then they've been gobbling up
sales from other speaker categories at
an ever-increasing rate with no sign of
slowing down in the future and in this
installment of why the debate is the
fitting a bleep who pinky are you buying
this we're going to discover why why
your TV speakers suck more now than ever
before and whether or not this
best-selling $75.00 sound bar off
amazon.com can solve the problem
speaking of problem solving Colton
solved our problem of not having a

unlike most technology trends the
speakers built into TVs have not been
getting better and better every year in
fact they've generally been getting
worse and the reason is that TV speaker
quality is not something that people
think about when they're buying a TV
with many customers wheeling their new
set out of the local Best Buy without
ever having listened to it so since the
mainstream mostly cares about screen
size picture quality and price
manufacturers that are trying to push
price down without sacrificing picture
quality while driving screen sizes up
naturally look to speaker quality as a
logical corner to cut but there's
actually another reason that TV speakers
are getting worse TVs are getting
thinner your dad's old CRT was big
enough to crush a juvenile hippo so
there was lots of space for the sound
coming out of proper speaker drivers to
bounce around him and the speaker's
could actually face the viewer a fairly
obvious advantage but the design
language of modern TVs dictates that
bezels be as thin as possible so
speakers either have to fire downward at
the TV stand or backwards towards the
wall and then bounce back at the viewer
which which is not ideal
since the reflecting surfaces can color
the sound dramatically that is why
you'll see people even snooty elitist
ones recommend that you upgrade to just
about anything other than your TV
speakers which is exactly where this
puppy comes in at $75 it's unlikely that
the two two and a half inch drivers
inside the Vizio SB to nine to zero dash
c6 or as I call it this sound bar are
much higher quality than what you would
find already onboard a TV but at least
they're actually pointing at you and the
sound can resonate within its 29 inch
cabinet setup is super easy you just
plug it into the wall and then well you
could actually just stop there and use
it as a Bluetooth speaker
or you could use the included RCA
coaxial or digital optical cable to
connect it to your TV and you're done
this simplicity is one of the big
reasons that sound bars have captured so
much market share from home theater in a
box solutions I mean just because I'm
not satisfied with my TV speakers
doesn't mean that I have the inclination
not to mention the space to run a bunch
of wires underneath my carpet or along
my baseboards or whatever for my
receiver to my satellite speakers behind
the couch and yadda yadda yadda and some
of them actually sound pretty good
like the Sonos oh it's got four full
range woofers and one high frequency
tweeter
it's got voice control via a le x8 and
soon the Google assistant and it's got
support for the brand-new Apple AirPlay
to standard for synchronizing multiple
speakers wirelessly the this sound bar
has none of that stuff but considering
the price
another big sound bar advantage over
multi speaker setups it's only really
got one job be better than TV speakers
so let's see if it can do that we're
comparing our budget sound bar against
the internal speakers of two displays
that we had lying around the wasabi
mango UHD 430 monitor equipped with two
down firing 10 watt speakers and the
high-end LD 65 KS 9500 with 220 watt
speakers also aimed towards the floor
none of our solutions sound great but
this sound bar is a definite improvement
over both of our displays in multiple
ways fuller sound deeper bass and most
of all better clarity especially when
listening to low quality recordings of
people with accents the most interesting
takeaway here though at least from a
normy perspective is that this cheap
sound bar achieves all of this despite
being advertised as being way less
powerful only 5 watts compared to the 20
and 40 watts combined of the
place and this might sound a little
unintuitive but part of why it sounds
better is due to the directional stuff
we talked about earlier and another
factor especially with the cheaper
wasabi mango is that the sound can be
muddied by low quality chassis materials
that resonate with the audio playing
along and reducing clarity but with that
said low power is still low power so
while this budget bar is a worthy
upgrade when watching TV don't expect to
be able to fill your house with your
favorite tunes during a house party this
sound bar is not great at max volume not
only does it not get very loud but it
can struggle the power itself resulting
in a skipping effect that is totally
unlistenable
so conclusion time should you join the
throngs of people who have bought this
sound bar well if your hearings going
and everyone on TV sounds like they're
mumbling it will help a lot and it even
has DTS true volume to help equalize the
volume differences between say regular
videos and freaking streaming ads so
it's not a bad Buy but if $75 is still
too rich for your blood well you could
always try sound scoops pieces of
plastic that you velcro to your TV in an
attempt to redirect your down firing
audio toward the cut I am not even
kidding
I mean it's worth the shot right do you
don't see a review Brendon should we
review that no let us know in the
comments if you agree or disagree with
Brendon he's saying no I think we should
and on your way down to the comments
check out the link to ting ting is the
mobile carrier that does rates not plans
you pay just six dollars per phone line
plus the minutes messages and data that
you actually use each month usage is
shared across all your devices so the
more phones you have on one ting account
the less you pay per phone and with an
average bill of just 23 bucks a month
per phone ting is the smarter choice for
mobile they offer service on two
nationwide LTE networks so the phone you
already own will probably work with ting
there are no contracts no overage fees
and you can try it for a month with no
commitment so get 25 bucks off your bill
or towards a new phone in the ting shop
at Linus ENCOM we're gonna have that
linked below so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucks you know what to do
but if it's awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy this stuff we featured
in the video description also linked in
our description is our merch stores has
cool shorts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join oh we missed a key benefit of the
this sound bar it's a lot lighter than
the Sonos one if someone drops it on
your face we should we should have
worked that in there I think we sure
worth that it can we can we work that in
there I think we should work that in
there oh oh oh so first you hit me in
the nose you make it swell up then you
make fun of me for it being big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
