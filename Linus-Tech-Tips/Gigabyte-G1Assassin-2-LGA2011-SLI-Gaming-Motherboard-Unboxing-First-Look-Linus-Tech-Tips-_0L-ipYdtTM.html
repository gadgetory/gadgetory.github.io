update to the g1 assassin which we
actually oh yeah we have our do you want
assasin system over here so we will be
updating our g1 assassin LGA 1366
machine right there with the dual 5 90s
and the liquid cooling and the all the
good stuff we will be updating that with
this board once we are finished unboxing
it and once I have the LGA 2011 mount
that I need for Smith Tech's waterblock
in order to rebuild our extreme buyer's
guide system so this guy's got a 5 year
warranty as well as some other upgrades
over the original g1 assess and one of
them is a Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi card
that is included another one is their
patent-pending 3d bios dual UEFI bios so
I'll be doing a video on 3d bios in the
near future here we also have 3d power
which is basically gigabytes way of
saying that they have 3-way digital
power delivery on this particular board
it's not see 3d is more like three
digital rather than 3-dimensional
whereas this is more like three
dimensional so yes so they mean a couple
of different things what else we got
back here ok so you know what let's get
the board open let's open up the board
let's cut to the chase skip to the good
part
and I know someone someone is going to
make a comment on that
on YouTube I know because they did it
when I did my original d1 assassin
unboxing for some reason yes both the g1
assassin one and the g1 assassin to let
out a huge fart when I open them up
there's nothing I can do about it
grow up now I'm just kidding you don't
have to grow up farts are funny ok so
here we go
we have some bullets some bullet holes
and a g1 killer dude we've also got some
more bullets and bullet holes and more
g1 killer logos we've got a poster which
is different from the g1 original series
posters which featured the gorilla the
sniper and the assassin this one is just
the general g1 logo so this has oh it
has the original ones on
but not the new ones I guess they didn't
update the poster fascinating okay we've
got a gigabyte sticker included and look
at all these accessories that's some
good accessory action going on here so
we have our Bluetooth and Wi-Fi PCI
Express 1x adapter which incidentally
doesn't only work antennas on gigabyte
motherboards it also works on whatever
motherboard you want so if you happen to
buy one of these boards and you happen
to need Wi-Fi and bluetooth on some
other machines and you just got yourself
an extra value add we have a crossfire
bridge a 3-way SLI bridge as well as an
SLI bridge these are all long bridges
which is nice let's you use that long
spacing this is a USB data cable for
that Bluetooth card
all right Wi-Fi Bluetooth card it does
both we've got one right angle or two
right angle and two straight SATA cables
all right we've got a front three and a
half inch USB 3 doodad that plugs into
the header of your motherboard so if you
don't have a case that has front USB 3
now you do next we've got an i/o shield
some documentation including some disks
that you're gonna want to go ahead and
download the latest from the gigabyte
website so one disk for the board one
disk for your GC Wi-Fi that is that a
wireless bluetooth guy you got your
manual you got a manual for the GCC
Wi-Fi and that pretty well does it looks
like that probably went in there aha I
figured out how this works like a
gizzard sure Harry Potter could figure
out how to unblock something it's too
bad those movies are over
I enjoyed the Harry Potter movies now
I'll never get to watch one ever again
because they're not really like they're
good they're no they're kind of fun to
watch but I don't think they really
merit like a rewatch so to speak you
know what I'm gonna put it over here
yeah we're gonna put it on its digicam
camouflage box and there's absolutely
nothing camouflage about this board this
board is about as like out there as it
gets so here we go let's start with the
overall package so the overall package
is Excel is it Excel a chance hold on
just a gosh darn minute here no it's not
I'll be back in a moment so I thought
this was the XLE ATX board but it turns
out I was wrong
the ud7 is the excel ATX board so this
is an ATX board with an LGA 2011 socket
right smack in the not-quite middle but
a little bit off to the right side and
it supports four dims in quad-channel
so that means you have support for up to
32 gigs of memory if you're using 8 gig
dims and potentially 64 gigs in the
future when that sort of comes out if it
ever does ok what else we got here we
have our 8 pin connector and I would say
it's not quite ideal location it is on
the top edge of the board but it is not
over here in this corner which is where
most cases are usually putting a cutout
so that you have easy access to it
we've also got our 24 pin ATX connector
in its ideal location along the
right-hand edge we've got our USB 3
connector and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge we've also got our
SE 2 3 6 gigabit per second ports right
about here
our SATA 2 3 gigabit per second ports
right about here so that's 2 of those
and for those and finally on a
third-party chipset we have more say 2 3
6 gigabit per second ports here now in
terms of the cooling solution we're used
to seeing pretty cool cooling solutions
on the g1 board so we've got kind of a
sort of silence or muzzle looking thing
over here that looks like kind of like a
barrel and that looks kind of Lake up
you know stock or not a stock what's the
thing you hold I don't know the grippy
thing where you put your left hand if
you're right-handed okay and then we
have a heat pipe going down to a pistol
which says gigabyte gaming motherboard
and this is hilarious you guys are gonna
love this ok here
Denton it heatsink not a weapon cannot
be assembled as a firearm so just in
case you were wondering no you cannot
assemble it as a firearm and you're dumb
for thinking that ok not that I ever try
to insult my viewers but come on really
like really ok so front panel connectors
are right about here on the bottom
there's your powered USB 2 so powered
USB 2 is useful for charging things like
iPads and
other tablets and good stuff like that
we've also got two additional USB to
front panel headers we have our front
panel audio and we have full support for
up to three way crossfire or SLI so
you're going to be running 16 X 16 X 4 a
dual card configuration which would
leave you with PCIe 8 X and a PCIe 1x
for further expansion or you can run 16
X 8 X 8 X and that would leave you with
nothing else for further expansion
unless you're using water blocks which
is possible what we also find down here
is our amplified onboard audio so
headphone amps I'm a big sort of
advocate of using a properly amplified
headphone output if you are using
headphones especially ones with
reasonably high impedance which is
anything that's higher end and a fairly
basic set of headphones so that is there
we also have the onboard yes with
dedicated RAM killer a 2100 NIC card and
up here you find all kinds of like
fascinating little chips most of which I
don't know what they do here's a fresco
logic there's our Marvell which I would
say is probably powering raid but my
guess would be that it's not and
probably powering the eSATA got another
Marvel chip over here okay that's a good
stuff hey let's look at where all the
fan headers are okay so we have our CPU
fan header here you want to sort of back
up a little bit for this part of it oh
yeah you are good job ok
CPU fan header here we've got another 4
pin fan header here another one here so
that's three so far we've got another
one here so that's four we've got
another one here so that's 5 so we have
5 4 pin PWM fan headers on the g1
assassin 2 and let's have a look at what
we've got in terms of rear i/o so we
have a ps2 u ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 USB 2.0 ports an OC
button that is a OneTouch overclock a
BIOS selector switch that is very very
handy and very cool to see we've also
got a CMOS Clear button 2 eSATA ports so
those are those esata/usb combo ports
two USB 3.0 ports there's your killer
2100 networking and finally 7.1 audio
out in
optical audio out although the omission
of a microphone in a dedicated
microphone in port is a very strange one
to me so what you guys can probably see
here is that this is a little bit costed
down compared to the original g1
assassin but they still have left along
most of the features that I would say
gamers would care about most gamers are
not loading up their system with 128
gigs or 64 gigs of memory so that you've
still got the four slots for
quad-channel operation you've still got
your full support for 3-way SLI or
crossfire X you got your killer big foot
networking you've got your headphone amp
sound card that is built-in okay you
know what bearing in mind okay I'm
criticizing them on the mic part missing
here but you can obviously use your
front panel mic which is probably what
they're expecting you to do now that I
think about it a little bit more so yeah
