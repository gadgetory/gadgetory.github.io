XCOM hey guys we're up here in the VIP
section of the CM storm booth which is
very very cool because they have a green
switch cherry mechanical keyboard these
are Cherry MX greens and they are very
very heavy I know
explaining what switches are like on
video is very very difficult and most
people don't actually understand because
you really really can't tell how it will
feel to you until you try it in person
the biggest thing that I suggest people
do when they're buying mechanical
keyboard is they try out all the
different switch types they can before
buying one and if you're buying a green
that is very important because well I
might like it it is very very heavy and
they push back up against you very very
hard if you have experience typing on a
blue it's not just a slight increase in
weight it's very very noticeable I
currently use Blues on almost all my
keyboards and I love it and I would
really like to have a green although I
don't have one currently because I like
that that heavy heavy feedback where
it's really really pushing against you
they're very very very heavy so if
you're interested in a green I would
highly highly suggest trying one out
before you buy one but if you do want to
buy one CM storm has them and they are
one of the only companies I know that
make full green mechanical keyboards I
know ducky has in the past and a few
other company has as well but they are
currently doing it although they are
having problems keeping them in stock
because they are selling very many of
them I just wanted to show you guys
green switches now if you're wondering
how they compare they're very very heavy
compared to blues like I explained
before they have a tactile bump that you
can hear and they're very very clicky
they're actually a little bit more
accurate than blues our Blues have a
slight problem where when you hear the
click as you can hear this I hope you
could hear that I just shove the mic
right on top of it
you can hear that the blue the actuation
point isn't exactly where the click is
so if you just click it and come back up
you might not actually actuate the key
meaning that the key press does not get
transferred to the computer greens are
more accurate in that aspect which is
cool now don't freak out if you're
buying a blue and you're worried that
it's not going to actuate every single
time you go down it is quite accurate
it's just in
problem it can happen sometimes it won't
happen very often thank you for watching
