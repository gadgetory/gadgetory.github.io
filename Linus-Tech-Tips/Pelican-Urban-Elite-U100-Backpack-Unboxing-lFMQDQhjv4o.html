Coolermaster mobile featuring the jazz
pro notebook stand check it out at
mobile Coolermaster usa.com welcome to
my unboxing and first look at the
pelican urban elite u-100 now we're all
familiar with Pelican cases in fact if
you watch our videos you should probably
be quite familiar with them because we
unboxed one that we use to transport our
camera to CES but now they have
backpacks that have integrated Pelican
cases so basically dust proof waterproof
with a purge valve just generally BS
proof if something bad happens you're
going to hope that your device was
inside something like this when the bad
thing happened so let's go ahead and
start with the Pelican style features of
the backpack and then we'll move on to
the slightly less interesting stuff so
in here we've got places to put pens and
post-it notes and school supplies and
all that kind of stuff and then we've
got an armored tablet pouch right in the
very front of the backpack now you're
not going to fit any huge tablets in
here in fact it's probably mostly
optimized for like your iPad or your
transformer or whatever else sort of
those sizes of things but you can go
ahead check that in there and it's going
to sit in there very comfortably in fact
it looks like it sized perfectly for an
iPad there's a soft surface here at the
front if you don't keep your iPad in a
case so you don't have to worry about
the screen getting damaged and there's
yet another pouch right here where you
can keep sort of stuff that you want to
keep there alright moving on to the next
Pelican II feature so they're calling
this the S shape back or something like
that s-curve comfort back so there's
like a ton of padding here here and here
but you can see this isn't flat at all
like you see the contour there it sticks
into the small of your back and then
curves around your shoulder blades so
there's actually a way to take this
apart and there's kind of like a little
hidden pocket here in the top where you
can put more stuff and then down here
you can see the dense foam that they're
using to make the s-curve because the
back here is actually the Pelican case
itself that makes up the main laptop
compartment that is where your stuff
will be safe in this particular I wanted
to call it a chassis but it's a backpack
since we're here at the back we might as
well check out the
comfort features so these are kind of
they feel kind of like a gel strap so
they rebound fairly quickly and they're
pretty firm they're not soft like a
memory foam or anything like that but
honestly that's probably better for a
backpack because any foam that
compresses too much or too consistently
is basically like no foam at all you're
better off to have a gel so there is a
chest strap goes right here there you go
and the overall build quality is very
solid like these buckles are metal as
opposed to being made out of plastic
fully adjustable and all that stuff that
you'd expect stitching looks extremely
high-quality I mean if you yeah I mean
yeah I like Pelican products already so
you don't really have to sell me on them
but yeah I like Pelican products because
they do tend to be just sort of stupidly
rugged all right so the inside they're
calling this a check point sort of ready
laptop pouch so it's top loading which
means it's going to be easy to get out
in the event that you do have to show it
to someone at the airport
they include little spacers here so
depending on whether you have a thicker
notebook or a thinner one you're
supposed to install these spacers inside
the main pouch here so that it holds the
laptop in place without jiggling around
so if you had something like an
ultrabook obviously there'd be quite a
bit of space in there where it could
move around if you don't install
something like that so that's what it's
for and you can take these off simply by
threading them through here I believe
not melt there it is
so there's a Velcro piece here and you
can out not take those off okay
apparently I was wrong about that never
mind so it is intended to be loaded like
that is this it does not look like it
intends for you to open it up all the
way although I really really hope I'm
not wrong about that because should be a
way to open that hmm okay yeah no does
not does not look like it so there you
go that's what the inside looks like the
purge valve is on one of the sides there
there you go so that keeps the pressure
equalized in the event that it does drop
in water it's rated for 30 minutes under
three feet of water so as long as
nothing totally disastrous happens and
it should be should be all good in the
hood as far as your notebooks concerned
the waterproof seal is all around the
can't see that in the camera at all but
it's all around the outside here and the
latts closes with a very rugged sturdy
looking sort of OneTouch latch here the
handle on the top again it feels very
industrial and Pelican so it's got a
rubberized grip on not even rubberized
it's a rubber grip on the bottom so it's
extremely grippy and then the top is a
textured plastic the hinges are again
kind of ridiculous like instead of just
having one hinge there like why have one
interlocking piece when you can have
five so there you go because we're
Pelican because we can the sides expand
a little bit so you can either tighten
these up to have it not sit as far away
from your back or you can loosen them to
have them expand so you can fill it up a
fair bit even outside of the laptop
compartment
although the laptop compartment does
take up a good half of the overall
capacity of the backpack itself then we
get into all the stuff here so we can
unclip these ones and this yes okay good
this is the one where you can undo the
velcro here and you can open it up all
the way should you so desire so you'll
just undo that and it opens up
completely so this is your main
compartment this is where you put you
know your lunch or your textbook or
whatever else that is not critical and
doesn't need to be stored inside the
waterproof compartment I think that
pretty much wraps it up for the oat note
there we go
the bottom here is a really nice
rubberized thing going on so it's not
going to sort of slip or otherwise do
bad things more expansion spots here to
open up that compartment a little bit
more and last but not least I almost
forgot a hidden drink holder so you can
throw a drink in there and have it hang
off the side or you can tuck it away and
have it not hang off the side thank you
