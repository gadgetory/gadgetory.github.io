that I think might be interesting or
they might not it depends whether I can
get a compatible board or not
now cameraman don't get too close yet
but I want you to guess who the
manufacturer of this processor is okay
so I'm going to show you the top and I'm
going to show you the bottom and if you
guessed Intel you're wrong because these
are actually AMD Opteron c-32 socket
chips so they look just like an LGA 775
chip but they have a completely
different number of pins on the bottom
and these are these ones in particular
are quad cores but these are available
in quad core and six core configurations
even though they're these little tiny
chips see they came in green boxes
that's how you should have known that
they were AMD anyway I'm just gonna go
ahead and put that back in there but
these are actually compatible with up to
two way motherboards so that means you
can actually throw two of their six core
processors which are actually only
around I think 300 to 400 dollars for
the entry level six core ones into a
dual socket motherboard and you can make
one heck of a workstation for a pretty
good value with 12 physical cores so
this is a pretty neat one and whether or
not I'm able to do anything with this
will depend on whether I can get my
hands on a board or not because I can't
find anything yet but the big difference
between this and their previous
generation Opterons is these do support
ddr3 so that's a that's a new Opteron
thing and yet so they are two ways
socket compatible also they're just
crazily inexpensive given that they're
brand new Opteron chips
