by the way but I'm gonna try yeah sure
you know you don't be an idiot it'll
probably be more interesting to work
maybe I can try to recruit people while
I'm there I'll just like get a sign sit
on the side of the road be like need
developers please help if you know
JavaScript welcome to the show you guys
before the show and then we usually try
to do lunch once a week just last week
and I think we missed the week before
yeah this is the only time luke and I
talk to each other so yeah you'll have
to forgive us honestly it doesn't
account for all of it part of it is that
I was reviewing a script with Tarun
before this and I was doing that late
because I was building a machine with
one of our ROG rig reboot winners right
before that pretty banging machine did
you see it looks really nice yeah I
didn't like really inspect it but it
looks really nice from 7700 K 32 gigs
ram RGB up to but 1080 TI Strix yeah 165
Hertz monitor basically as good as I
would ever recommend awesome like
anything beyond that you're like kind of
dumb like for gaming really really
intense diminishing returns yeah yeah or
or you were literally worse yeah unless
you do something else yeah so so yeah we
were just chatting about floatplane Luke
is leaving the country yep not
permanently no one year will notice yeah
what will they notice they'll notice
your car not in the parking I may be
here yeah now that you have that like
hid know I have the furthest away from
any entrance office as far as I know
yeah like the most Awkward you would
only go there if you were going to my
office possible location and then I
entered not from the main entrance now
and my alley
well I enter from that side what am i
right
like a really quick loop yep your
basically your private stairwell yeah
anyway
Dennis was Dennis just mentioned before
the show that he's seen me like 10 times
this year Dennis I think I'm lesson
focused now
I think Soho we have what we have a
month so well you're reading that in
focus
yeah hi mom oh I'm good I miss you to it
this is probably the point where she
mentions that I also don't see my I'm
not sending him anywhere unsafe it's
okay oh I don't know she knows that I'm
going into the country yeah it's not
like Somalia no it's fine yeah well I'm
sending myself yeah yeah like he's the
CEO of that company and he made an
executive decision that he needed to
have a meeting out of the country and
informed me that he was going yeah
that's pretty good Suzy virya no this is
completely my idea I'm going to Sweden
so like it's not like I don't want to go
there and I'm visiting a guy that I've
known for a long time and we're gonna
work on some floatplane stuff right I
did sort of forget that I'm also leaving
tomorrow
and I haven't booked my ticket yet what
it's fine there's available - he's
getting mothered on both sides right now
by the way just so you know I'm with you
on this
it'll work I would be fine yeah yeah I
have a place to stay that I can't really
detail but I do have a place to stay
this time I have traveled without a
place to stay before this is an
improvement all right well thank you for
calling in it's always a pleasure all
right all right so we've got a great
show for you guys today
Intel's 18 core high-end desktop die has
been pictured the iPhone 8 is rumored to
cost more due to Samsung's control of
OLED display supply apparently we're
putting a headphone jack back into the
iPhone 7 well we're not but some go this
is the same guy I believe that like
built his own iPhone out of a whole
bunch of little components hey do you
hear about that okay this is the same
guy so he went to China and went to like
the little shops that had little like
individual iPhone components and he
built this hole on one that like works
in stuff and like the touch ID and
everything functions really it's pretty
cool it's it's took him months but then
he was like traveling in and out cuz he
was like working there and doing those
kinds right and he was doing it just
like overtime on the side it's a really
cool video series it's quite a long
video but it's really interesting I
believe this is the same guy but I'm not
I wasn't certain
and then AMD Vega 11 enters production
intro time oh oh I'm gonna use a screen
back screen back didn't work
what Billy I tested this last didn't
work again are you wait wait wait wait I
love it
are you using the are you using the I'm
not using anything hold on hold on are
you using the xsplit blog for
broadcaster PTR I don't think so I
didn't launch this oh we have to use the
public test release if we were fine yeah
I didn't watch that was already set up
what I got I think thankful yeah yeah
okay so just to talk of oh no we're
playing a track yeah look
yeah
Mack Weldon no no no no no I didn't put
on the shirt before the show I'm gonna
have to change into it and risk a nip
slip
oh my dang it I'll body block you
twitches terms of service are gonna be
the end of me yep all right damn nipple
equality oh wait oh and we're back oh
man I am excited for today's show for
one reason and that is that I didn't do
the okay so I think I figured it out
it's when we put the computer to sleep
and wake it back up with xsplit still
running that the the capture cards oh
okay the camera just no that's fine that
one's already working though you can
tell which one the camera one is by the
way it is everything's amazing oh yeah I
guess I could have done that
okay so our first topic was posted by
the Benjamins on the forum and the
original article here is from hexxus
dotnet famous overclocker
der Bauer you know what I think der
Bauer does so well even though
professional overclockers generally are
like really well known within the
professional overclocking community so
basically like it's a big circles circle
congratulation I have to use it I think
the reason that he has kind of broken
out into the mainstream is the guy's got
a personality he does I've met him he's
cool yeah why I met him but I like his
videos yeah like he's actually super
cool I ran into him at Computex and he's
roasted us before and I still liked his
video really I mean it was like YouTube
tech reviewers I was like alright
alright ramen I thought
am i included with YouTube tech
reviewers you might be I don't review
anything anymore
oh I mean if you think about it I mean
there's still like graphs and that's
opinions in our videos which is like a
forum that's okay
I'm over it okay so right here on the
left is the 7900 X so this is the ten
core core i9 and on the right is the
utterly massive eighteen core die of the
upcoming 79 20x so there's a couple of
takeaways here number one is that in
case you were wondering eighteen course
means a bigger die than ten course which
will hopefully have at least some
positive effect on our ability to pool
this bloody thing because we actually
have a video coming on D living Intel
processors that's coming really soon
we know mainstream and the high end no
so we we stripped down to 79 hundred
because we can almost did it for nope
can't talk about it I don't even know
about this but didn't oh yeah wait what
never mind
Oh move on continue okay where was I
going with this right so we know that
it's bigger which will hopefully help us
move heat away from it because hopefully
the the heat density won't be any higher
so if we just put a really powerful
cooler on it that's got a an enormous
cooling plate then maybe we'll be okay
and it also tells us based on that
that's a shiny clean dye that Intel is
still using an easy-to-clean thermal
interface material rather than soldering
the dye so as some of you probably know
AMD is soldering the dyes on their Rison
and thread ripper chips I do still
intend to try to delete a thread Ripper
it should theoretically be pasta
because did you see the vanity thread
rippers that they provided to youtubers
and and influencers so it's a thread
Ripper tip with your publication name
lasered into the top yeah so but it
doesn't work well I want it to work so
you're gonna take that off and swap with
it that's cool so yeah that's gonna be a
video project sometime in the next
seoul-beijing
what's the what's the theory the theory
hypothesis how are you gonna go about
this so I plan to do it the same way
that I did the qx60 700 way back in the
day okay so what I did was I carefully
and I'm gonna use the dead one to
investigate how well it works because
what do I have to lose it's dead one
yeah so I'll cut the seal all around it
and so you just have to be really
careful that you didn't go too deep with
the razor blade so you don't cut off our
resistor or something yeah then what I
did was I just put some thermal paste on
it put it on to a pot and then put the
pot on a hot element on the stove okay
that way as soon as the solder gets hot
enough it will release and you can just
pop it off and get it away from the hot
element so that way you don't heat it up
any more than you have to and also you
don't heat up any part of the chip that
you don't have to you know any more than
you have to that make sense girls
thinking you're gonna have to heat it in
some way and I was worried that you'd
fry it that way I guess so the qx60 700
that I did back in the day did survive
and then the way that I got the solder
off was actually just with a plastic
scraping tool and a lot of patience so
that's that's my plan and we'll see if
it works maybe twitch ad is telling me
about how it's not going to work in the
dashboard it's just full of people
getting time out so maybe I'll have to
go to the public theater to see the
actual twitch ed yeah hopefully I can
hit the pause button before we get an
echo apparently people are pretty pretty
roasted about how out of focus we are
right now oh damn oh damn Colin's gonna
come in and try and do it twice oh you
look at her focus I don't know about
myself I just like shiny
the same okay tell you what tell you
what just for you guys we're gonna pause
the show we're gonna okay Colton Colton
but the wheel on the front will you know
the lens let's do it let's do it okay no
worse ask a Vee I'd love to
ah we tried to contact him okay other
way he was like me
other way not quite not too far that oh
yeah that looks good ah still mean well
like right up against this now anyways
it's actually still yeah it's really
soft yeah I think I don't even get this
like where are we I think it's like way
up here okay you got to come further
back this way come on back yeah it's
like here my hand is nice and InFocus Oh
too far well let's go with that let's go
with that alright alright okay cool so
what else do we know you know depth of
field folks different things what I was
saying was we could get one with a wider
one so that it seems like we're more in
focus more often because the focus is a
constant problem yep so we could we
could turn less apertures and then
deeper depth yeah a focus field okay the
iPhone 8 will apparently cost more
because Samsung is controlling OLED
supply also there will apparently be no
touch ID due to 3d touch so this was
posted by red round 2 on the forum and
the original article here is from 9 to 5
Mac what I want to know 9 to 5 Mac is
why you guys aren't willing to put in
the extra hours typical employer
question these guys if they even want to
be paid for their lunch I only work
eight actual hours so they probably take
a half hour lunch they probably take two
15-minute smoke breaks come on you guys
smoking is disappointing you're
disappointing me here you're
disappointing me here okay
so let's go ahead and run through run
through what we got here so it's the new
iPhones display is expected to include a
flexible OLED panel an OLED touch panel
a 3d touch monob module and an OLED
panel module but Samsung will be
responsible for providing each OLED part
with the only exception in the stack
being the 3d touch module so normally
Apple will leverage multiple suppliers
this helps keep costs low and they've
even gone as far as to use both TSMC and
Global Foundries
to fit our wait is it TSM team Global
Foundries or was it were they using
Samsung as a fab they've used multiple
fabs for their actual like compute chips
sorry it's tsmc and Samsung a lot less
common have they ever made a chip in
Global Foundries blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah no makes last-minute
decision to use tsmc for 30% of a9 chip
facing poor yield rates from chip maker
Global Foundries so solidify its chain
etc a Samsung Google foundry used to
produce the 14 okay so it looks like
whatever the point is they've gone as
far as to dual source even the CPUs in
their phones which is pretty ballsy not
how many people do that which is super
ballsy because even if you make the same
CPU at the same process node Samsung's
Intel's Global Foundries TSM sees all of
their technology even on the same node
is going to be slightly different with
different characteristics so one might
consume more power one might pluck a
little higher one might do both one
might do neither you never actually know
until you've actually got silicon in
hand what some of the quirks of a
manufacturing process will be so in this
case they are not able to take advantage
of an additional supplier and it looks
like oh beep sorry
it looks like the OLED unit is estimated
to cost a hundred and twenty to a
hundred and thirty dollars per screen
versus the 45 to $55 per unit cost of
LCD panels
huh you think anyone's gonna care do you
think anyone that buys iPhones
consistently and has been for a while
he's gonna care it's $100 mark rice yeah
um you know let me think for a second
because okay someone will care how much
of an impact do you think it'll make
with the amount of whinging that I've
seen over the Galaxy Note 8 price which
is actually about $100 more than an s8
plus and 4-year hundred dollars you get
a stylus okay my point here though is
that it's Apple customers instead of
Samsung customers that's fair
but I would argue that a note customer
is pretty close to an apple customer
pretty close to an apple customer
because I think the note customer is
locked into into a way of using the
device that goes beyond Android right
because there's a feature that is
literally not on something else there
that they value yeah and so you know I I
don't think for $100 that it's that big
of a deal but there were a lot of people
who were pretty about her now
Oh actually I wanted to address another
quick thing about the note 8 video some
people were upset that I was that I was
freaking out about the 200 milli amp
hour smaller battery on the no-date
versus the s8 plus saying that the note
8 gets better battery life than the s8
plus 2 that I would say yeah that may be
sure that may be true for now but you
also have to remember that the note 8
also has I can't remember they don't
call it TouchWiz anymore but whatever
Samsung's UI is yeah the node 8 also has
TouchWiz features that the s8 plus
doesn't have because it gets a new
version of the software the fact that
they're running the same CPU with
actually I believe the note it has more
RAM depending on the the storage version
of the s8 plus don't quote me on that
one
but basically there's nothing about the
s8 plus that consumes more power than
the note 8
has a smaller display marginally so
there will be a difference even if there
isn't today even if at launch Samsung is
positioning the note 8 as having better
battery life some of the chap all
capital letters quoting you on that one
that's okay if you go ahead I'm for the
rage Linus is this panel cracked what
the crap just happened I think my screen
is scratched that sucks
I really like this laptop okay I'm sad
weird I don't see Oh like it just looks
like a little hair on there but it's not
not really sucks okay it's not gonna
show up in camera room
so backs back to your question do I
think that the hundred dollar so I
wouldn't have okay excess you had seen
that except that people were so upset
about the extra hundred dollars for the
no date that's fair I think I don't
think it's gonna affect a lot of
purchasing decisions but it might hurt
some fanboy mentality I don't know the
Apple fan behaves a little differently
they do then the typical fan like they
they tend to defend apples need to make
a profit on their devices they tend to
defend the sort of disparity between
their pricing you're totally right and I
don't think it's completely changed but
it's been changing a little bit I don't
I don't feel like people would just Auto
buy everything from them anymore and we
saw that with the watch the Apple watch
didn't actually sell that well watches
in general didn't actually sell that
well yes mart watches seem to be tablets
are going quiet
yeah no one cares about a new ipad
anymore which is why i Apple did that
commodity basically like education
Edition iPad honestly
okay I think the hundred dollars would
be pretty easy to swallow if Apple was
bringing something game-changing to the
table and I think that's where Samsung
ran into trouble a little bit because my
biggest issue with the no-date wasn't
that it's not a great phone it's a great
phone does everything my issue with the
no date was that it was really safe you
basically made a note seven with a
smaller battery uh-huh and what did they
add again
oh right dual camera it has not
surprised the dual cameras really not
that impressive so so that was where we
ran into trouble the big highlight
feature the dual camera didn't blow my
mind and so and it's an extra hundred
bucks for someone who's not a heavy
stylus user yeah I don't really care
whereas here if the iPhone eight has
this like basically floor-to-ceiling
wall to wall display surface and people
are really into that then an extra
hundred dollars might not be a big deal
but kind of a killer from me on it is
this is how I take out my iPhone I I
lift it up to my face like this and
touch ID has unlocked the phone before
before I would ever get a chance to
align the phone with my eyes and unlock
it with my irises well before that he
just did both of those by the way the
rumor is that the iPhone 8 or whatever
they end up calling it iPhone edition
the rumor is that it will rely on facial
recognition and old-school typed
passwords instead of touch ID because
their plan to embed a touch ID sensor
under the display is rumored to be
cancelled since OLED creates an
unfavorable scan through scenario for
the fingerprint sensor that's really
disappointing which is sort of a bummer
because apples touch recognition is
awesome sorry that only didn't go
because I hadn't clicked it yet like
it's so fast I would really miss that
you know and I would look at something
like that and I would go the decision
between an iPhone 6s because your your
form of power users mostly speed am i
correct yes I'm all about like getting
stuff done with might so you were
absolutely a power user of your phone
but like I don't do much with not in
terms of like gaming or not like
watching really high quality video no
yes I expect performance and that's one
thing that the iPhone does really well
but the thing is is that the iPhone 7
and the 6s for that matter are both
really fast and the weird thing that an
iPhone 8 with this gorgeous
full-coverage display but lack of touch
ID does for me is it creates this weird
segmentation in Apple's product lineup
like they they tend to still support
older iPhone models so I'm looking at it
going okay so it's iPhone 6s if you want
a headphone jack its iPhone 7 if you
want better battery life and better
performance than the 6s but you don't
care about the headphone jack and then
it's the iPhone 8 if you want this cool
display experience but you're giving up
both the headphone jack and touch ID and
it costs more and it costs more and
instead of it just being like an
unequivocally better experience as you
move up the stats trade-offs cuz you are
actually making trade-offs as you go
which is really I feel like that would
be unacceptable to Steve Jobs it's let
me try much they like basically
reinvented the wheel then he'd be like
no this is what the experience is now
and it would be a big deal
did they ever take back a feature
they're not one of a previous iPhone put
together pieces from other things and
went look this is better
still Casteel the hill yeah they stole
the wheel and they put other spokes on
it and they're like heck yeah um trendy
ones yeah
really trendy wheels really trendy
spokes sorry the wheels were made by
someone else okay
speaking of taking features off the
iPhone and or putting them back on this
is a pretty cool video it's from strange
parts guys only ever published to videos
ever one was the one we were talking
about yeah so the first one is how I
made my own iPhone and it's 23 and a
half minutes long and then this one is
bringing back the iPhone headphone jack
and it's thirty three and a half minutes
long and both of them are really
interesting I haven't fully watched the
new one yet but the first one I have
watched the entire thing it's a great
video he's only released two videos like
- just said his other ones for four
months ago and has nine million views
his new ones from two days ago and
already has 1.7 million views all right
awesome
I dropped the link in the chat but I'm
pretty sure fair use allows us to show a
little bit of his video for the sake of
illustrating that he made a video so
basically he does a bunch of stuff to
the iPhone 7 that he says he loves but
it didn't have a headphone jack find
some contact basically does some pretty
crazy DIY shiz my friends Wow so
basically he ripped off how the
Lightning adapter works and then like
that's incredible it's wild like Eve
even the how I made my own iPhone video
is absolutely wild like how he finds all
the different things and how he talks
different people to get information to
find out like oh I needed these little
tiny like silver contact pads that have
to go in this one area that like aren't
detailed anywhere but they have to go
there so that there's like spacing
between whatever and like he details all
of his different talks with different
people and he details everything and
he's doing and I don't know about this
one but the how I made my own iPhone
video went over as far as I know months
right he's like doing little pick up
vlog things the whole time it's really
cool I haven't fully seen the new one
yet
highly suggest watching both yeah go
check it out you guys dramas strange
parts and we've got one more let's do
one more topic before we jump into our
sponsors
this is sources WCC F Tech so take it
with a grain of salt
AMD Vega 11 GPUs supposedly entering
production with Vega 20 rumored to be
coming on 7 nanometre so the AMD rumour
mill is a going strong Vega 11 will
supposedly be an actual replacement for
Polaris 10/20 and the rx 580 and 570
graphics cards it's rumored to feature
HBM to memory which I would assume AMD
has some compelling reason for yeah
given that there again this is a rumor
but given that they're rumored to be
losing money on RX Vega right now due to
the cost of HBM - given that I would be
floored if HP m2 is cheaper than some
GDD are variants and given that like
even once
I believe that SK Hynix that they're
waiting to come online so that pricing
will get more competitive and like why
would a mid-range card even need
HBM to memory like HP m2 is super cool
but GD r5 is a very solid pretty damn
well performing implementation like why
don't I put it this way it's not very
expensive if gddr5 is good enough for
the GT X 1080 Ti and your upcoming
mid-range Vega is not faster than a 1080
TI why do you need
HBM - I don't think it's that big of
like a buzzword I know and that most
people don't know what it means
and he every time I talk to them they
are just like they can't wait to like
unzip and like show me their HBM to be
like we are bringing HBM to to consumers
and I'm sitting here going so what
consumers don't care what memory is
under the hood I just want to know how
fast it is in whatever games yeah there
are a few that do sure but they care
about the zero-to-sixty of the vehicle
and like if it has air someone in the
chat no idea what HP m2 is well yeah
watch it's a next generation graphics
made video Neverland
I'm not insulting you I'm just saying
like this is the thing the only thing I
can think of is if they think that it's
going to reduce the complexity and
therefore the cost of the of the
graphics card PCB to such an extent that
it will offset the additional cost of
the memory or if they basically the
other thing that I can think of is that
they just locked themselves into this
you know 18 months ago when development
started and there's no going back now
without significant R&amp;amp;D to to backtrack
on the decision and they're just kind of
boned because HBM to costs didn't fall
the way that they were hoping actually
you know what that's probably it okay oh
other news sorry yeah yeah I will aim
these next-generation high-end Vega 20 a
I and supercomputing general purpose
graphics chips will allegedly be made at
TSMC in order to take advantage of their
7 nanometer process technology which is
expected to enter volume production
sometime next year so this is all very
early rumor stuff where basically it
feels like AMD's in sort of they're
basically letting us know that there
will definitely be news for when show
about AMD all the way through the end of
this year and into the next year
thank you I appreciate that thank you
AMD b0
we appreciate the steady stream of leaks
yeah um it's it's appreciated we got to
talk about something yeah so it might as
well be it might as well be products
that that AMD hasn't made yet but but
but they're going to yeah and and it's
gonna be really good I don't know I mean
honestly I don't know how much of what
leaks out of AMD is unintentional and
how much of it is like Oh rx Vega is
sort of not that exciting especially
because GPU pricing is screwed right now
but we need headlines hey what are you
working on what's on your screen okay
cool cool man don't worry about it all
right sponsors for the show first up is
fresh box so let's say you're not in the
business of leaking AMD news you're in
the business of fixing and the computers
or Intel ones as it were you run a
small-time tech shop you run a plumbing
business you teach yoga in your garage
whatever it is you do if you're a small
business owner and you're looking for an
accounting solution this is great I even
said this recently freshbooks
is one of the only sponsors we've ever
had that has literally generated zero
complaints back to us I even challenged
people to complain and we didn't get a
single complaint let alone one that we
could validate back to somebody who
actually used it FreshBooks men that's
cool let's track your time with the
timesheet function manage your expenses
it helps you keep track of who owes you
what it has a feature that tells you
when a client looks at an invoice for
the first time it has the full
functionality in the mobile app for iOS
and Android so you don't even have to
sit down at your computer to work on it
and you can even call and talk to
someone immediately if you're having
trouble just no phone trees no axles
escalations no return calls just answers
try it out for 30
for free at freshbooks dock home slash
land and enter the land show in the how
you heard about us section number two is
Corsair oh wow I don't think Corsairs
sponsored the Wynn show in forever so
they refreshed their void series of
gaming headsets they now have the void
prep where are my keys you have an
iPhone you know I apparently have side
cutters in my pocket so don't worry yeah
I didn't get to show off my super cool
valve lanyard well you can if you want
it super cool valve lanyard
yet the stormtrooper on it let's storm
through front whose feet are lights you
can't really see them camera and they
can move independently so you can
absolutely light up two different places
at once
heck yeah you're such a dork and it's
why I love you so I'm unboxing at the
void parole okay fine hit me again we
got we got we got another seal we need
SEAL team Luke Wow get it awesome it's
funny because seal it's so bad that it
just like pulled it off
wow your I assumed you had a knife you
were just gonna gentle key in it yeah
there you go thank you sure work now
yeah you're janky alright so what do we
got in here
it's got microfiber okay first of all it
is like pretty darn it's secured in the
packaging like a toy it's not it's not
gonna be it's probably very unlikely
that it will be broke in the box yes it
is like as its gonna stay exactly where
it is this is seat-belted AF in there oh
yeah so at least it's got that you know
what it could it might not even you know
work but it's gonna look amazing no
dents no scratches it'll probably work
I'm just kidding it'll probably work
it's a pretty damn good chance that
it'll work yeah of course there should
bring us to there fine I'm just gonna do
the features okay so they've got oh yeah
we tuck it in there oh that's a cool
to stash the the USB adapter sound card
adapter thing this is a really good way
to do USB headsets
I was actually super mad at some of the
earlier Corsair headsets that just had
the USB connector right on the cable
yeah because this is so much more
versatile so it comes with a Dolby
headphone certified USB sound card that
way you could carry this in your bag you
could keep it somewhere safe just in
case it like came unplugged and fell off
or whatever so it's easier to cart
around and it's really flexible like
let's say Corsair came up with a new
headset and you wanted to get something
newer and shinier but maybe it didn't
come with a dongle for whatever reason
you could continue to carry this forward
which I really like
it's got microfiber ear cups 50
millimeter neodymium speaker drivers
with dolby headphone as i mentioned
before a unidirectional microphone that
cancels ambient noise so you can talk
strategically with clarity that's a
great talking point you guys so they've
got the void Pro special edition
wireless USB and surround version check
them out now through Amazon or Newegg at
the links under the video slash in the
twitch chat which I will post right now
I'm gonna post the Amazon one you know
what I think our commission is higher
from Newegg but if people buy other
unrelated crap on Amazon then we also
get a commission for that so I don't
know which one is better I will post
them both so if you're gonna buy there
you go if you guys wanna check out the
void Pro you can do that leading us to
our least safe for work sponsor spot oh
oh gotta be strategic oh I got this here
I'm good oh yeah yeah okay okay okay
hold on let me get that can you get the
cert ready okay no slip no slip hold on
oh wait I got it
yeah Mac well double your Mac well then
hold on just just hold that thought hold
that thought I've always wanted to be a
bro I want to do all the wait I'm
confused
no I got it okay Mac wellton boot Mac
Weldon believes in smart design premium
fabrics and simple shopping it's
actually like super easy and the clothes
are super nice
knack Weldon will be the most
comfortable underwear socks shirts
undershirts hoodies and if I had an
undershirt that would sell probably hope
honor shirts and sweat pants you will
ever wear and this is like the best part
for the the stereotypical gamers out
there on Mac Weldon has a line of silver
underwear and shirts your the thumbnails
gonna be now silver underwear shirts
which are naturally antimicrobial you
can even use silver in your water
cooling loop to keep junk from growing
in it that's how well silver works as an
antimicrobial agent and it just works
forever TM I mean nothing works forever
eventually everything turns to dust but
what happens is as you as you sweat or
as you get kind of gross the shirt
itself can actually cancel out some of
the microbial growth which cancels out
some of the smell which is super freakin
cool
Mac Weldon wants you to be comfortable
so if you don't like your first pair you
keep it and they will still refund you
no questions asked so go check them out
at Mac Weldon calm and get 20% off with
offer code tectus yeah huh that was
stressful I was worried we were gonna
get banned from twitch man yeah me too
intel has discontinued the core i7 6700
K and 6600 KS this was posted by xenos
tech on the forum in the original
article is from the tech report I mean
there's no real surprises here the the
rumors are that coffee lake is coming
very soon Intel rarely keeps a last
generation product alive for long after
they launch a new one especially because
they don't generally drop the price of
the last generation it's not really any
cheaper to make or it's not so much that
it's as it is that the new one isn't
really any more expensive to make so
just like well you might as well buy the
new one I guess I mean it's really break
so if you still want well I'm sure you
can buy one yeah and the 7700 K even
works in the same boards so it's like
there's like really not much reason to
run out and buy these
unless you get one on promo or something
but that tends to be pretty rare just
because of the way that Intel manages
their supply chain really well like
speaking as someone who came from the
channel it tends to be that just kind of
they must just have very predictable
sales because as the new one is coming
the old one just like kind of trickles
off in terms of supply and then by the
time they're gone they kind of are
selling slower anyway and you're ready
to transition into the new one and
there's never really a gap right it's
actually kind of magical how well people
think Intel I don't think anyone thinks
Intel's a marketing company but people
think Intel is an engineering company
and they are but what they also are is a
supply chain come they've talked about
it before we're really good yeah at
supply chain yeah so they'll be taking
orders of these chips through March 30th
of 2018 and shipping them through to
September of 2018 but I mean the reason
that they want to get rid of them is
that they would be taking up fab space
that could be used for other 14
nanometer products so yeah whatever
rumor Google preparing to buy HTC's
phone division so this is supposed to
buy daring on the forum and I like that
name for this news because that would be
pretty daring HTC and Google's
supportive supposedly in final stage of
negotiation regarding sale of smartphone
business I mean I see this being okay so
there's a couple things here I see this
being good news for HTC in that it gives
them an exit strategy and bad news for
HTC in that what do you do
any relevance that they could have
possibly hoped to have I mean I don't
know if the company is gonna survive on
vive but maybe they keep a very small VR
team that VRS or and I think they do
that like they obviously do some om
production because they did produce the
pixel they were the only they were the
only Android make her with little enough
self-respect that they were willing
to let Google get away with not putting
their brand on the pixel so like I mean
that could it's been a bad time to be
HTC for the last few years why I was
like VR has been doing a little bit
better lately
I'm sales have kicked up because it
discounts on the headsets and stuff yeah
it's been happening there's some big
games coming out actually I got to play
doom VR how was it packs it was actually
pretty good I don't think I'd like it
I bought Arizona Suns Arizona sunshine
and it's like scary like I like get
Floquet yeah but there's there's a
Skyrim and fallout as well I would
probably still get scared follow it's
maybe a little scary like either isn't
creepy stuff all right
and the president makes creepy games
yeah okay the thing the thing is that
like I usually play VR when I'm like I
just want to relax for a little bit
like I just so what I usually play is
the long bow game in the lab okay it's
really fun yeah and it's all cartoony
and happy and like even when you lose
it's like very
and like both there's balloons and stuff
they don't really care imma do another
one and the other day I was playing the
survival mode of Arizona sunshine and I
got to the level where they like to
start running at you and I was like
killing guys my dad played the Fallout
game er and he was like looking at the
dog didn't like kind of pretending to
pet it VRS stuff then a zombie comes up
and like hits the dog and my dad like
launched backwards in real life and like
one of the demo ladies had to like jump
out of the way and he immediately goes
to like commando position like holding
the gun goes like this cuz it's just a
pistol and it starts popping zombies of
like just immediately burst in action
cuz something hit his damn dog it's like
the fastest way to piss my dad off and
that's oh those three games are coming
all big from Bethesda and there's other
VR games that are continuing to come out
from more VR focus developers it's it's
VR stuff is becoming more legitimate
especially with these big titles are oh
here you go
AHA VR is has been spun off as a
standalone subsidiary already anyway
yeah so Google's incentive here is that
they want to produce hardware routers
phones whatever Google is getting into
consumer electronics and HTC has good
manufacturing facilities and that was
the m9 or m8 that was like the the one
piece of aluminum the m7 was then
someone that really got everyone's
attention and like made made HTC
relevant again yeah how are short a
period time they can do that stuff but
yeah so likes I see what's in it for
Google I see what's in it for HTC they
had their worst month in the past 13
years um in August revenue dropped by 51
point five percent compared to last
month and fifty four point three percent
one last August so like
yeah I totally see this making sense and
Google's probably the most sensible
buyer that I can think of pretty cool
all right
that's boring that's boring Wow okay
there is something important to say
about this oh okay just one really quick
thing okay hold on below I'll bring it
up then this is supposed to by scratch
cat on the forum the original articles
from CBC a hundred and forty three
million US consumers may have been
affected in a cyber attack yeah so this
is an Equifax cyberattack thing I don't
know enough about it we often stay away
from not always but we often stay away
from politically stuff especially
American political stuff because we're
not fully up to spec on it because we're
not Americans but I do want to put this
out here it's been mentioned a few times
I don't know if it's true or not but do
your own research to check if you've
been affected you have to click yes to
an agreement and most people just fly
through and click yes to everything and
the agreement is that you will not join
a class-action lawsuit so be careful I
don't 100% know if that's true but I've
seen it in a lot of places and it seems
to be true I would read it yourself but
basically the consensus is right now if
you've done anything with Equifax assume
that you're affected don't do the check
to see if you which is great because
Equifax is like really big deal and like
you can very very likely have your
identity be stolen that's who you go to
when you're at risk of identity theft
yeah no it's like actually I'm
apparently some Canadian and UK
residents an undisclosed number were
also accessed so personal information
for those games yeah and I don't I don't
know how well that thing that you're
agreeing to is gonna actually hold up I
suspect not at all I hold up yeah I
agree but just be careful when you're
clicking all this kind of stuff and just
kind of assume if you've dealt with them
that you're probably screwed yeah that's
all I have to say about that one
okay Wow um um oh what's app is finally
monetizing Oh more interesting so this
was originally posted by TechCrunch oops
what's apps first ads appear on Facebook
and start conversations with businesses
da da so they announced their plan to
eventually charge businesses stiring
worries that businesses might be able to
hold message users with sponsored
message ads want to drop this in here
apparently a New York Attorney General
is already totally crapping on that
agreement okay so like it probably not a
big deal just just be aware of what's
going on if you're affected by that
so now code in Facebook's ad manager has
been found that lets businesses buy ads
with a send a whatsapp message button
built in for now whatsapp isn't selling
ads on its own but testing a whatsapp
chat button on Facebook ads that
directly opens a conversation with a
business in whatsapp businesses will
only be able to contact whatsapp users
that have agreed to the message or have
agreed to be messaged by initiating the
conversation and sponsored messages will
work the same way on facebook Messenger
so businesses can pay to reconnect with
people they're already chatting with hmm
whatsapp initially promised not to show
ads when it was acquired by Facebook for
19 billion in 2014 but I mean I don't
know exactly what we said about it at
the time but I'm pretty sure we probably
called yeah a retailer apparently
confirms this was posted by lobster
Zoidberg on the forum on October 5th
date for six core coffee lake processors
dun dun duh this is a German site and
what we're looking at here is a core i7
8700 K and 8700 both with six cores 12
threads and 12 Meg's of level 3 cache
Wow single core and multi core boost of
4.7 and 4.3 gigahertz respectively in a
TDP of 95 watts looking pretty good
looking pretty sexy if ik I'm pretty
stoked I
been pretty clear that I'm super down
for coffee Lake 6-core mainstream
basically gives most people no reason to
blow a bunch money on X 299 or X 399 so
super awesome
and that's pretty much it
oh oh
organization vlog 3 trailer oh damn is
on Facebook now apparently so we can
show it nice yep and we're gonna have to
do the janky stupid audio sharing thing
actually do hold on hold on hold on
maybe there's a better way you don't
have to do the Doppler effect when
you're literally walking away from the
mic like you don't have to mimic it
because like it's actually happening I
don't see it oh there it is oh this is
exciting I haven't seen this we got this
we got this okay one hour now hold on
hold on I got a I got a setup okay I
think okay so I apologize in advance if
I am wrecking your guys you guys's ears
there are people complaining about the
sound already okay I don't know if this
is going to work
hold on let me try playing this okay
it's working but it looks like it's
pretty quiet on the levels so I'm gonna
turn it up a bit and I'm gonna hope for
the best
okay here we go continue click to enter
full screen
uh-huh so this is up on floatplane
already and hopefully this is gonna work
way to go
facebook video thank you for everything
about what you are giving me promotions
for full plane
get it what is going on here click for
more how about it just work option what
if I click on how about you work that
would be great no really okay
let's just let's just reload this
awesome why why you know work well while
we get this trailer spun up if you go
and look on floatplane you can just
watch the whole thing right now so if
you're a floatplane subscriber instead
of just watching the trailer on LAN show
through Linus's laptop which is failing
to load because facebook you can just go
watch it on the forum thanks Bixby
actually I don't even like like is
twitch explaining to me how this works
no in some way I wonder if it's this
sound device that's glitching it out
what what even what even just I see this
this is what I have to deal with around
here oh okay so it's supposedly working
now I wonder if it hates myself the
scarlet as a sound output that would be
weird
my entire life is okay no it seems like
it's working now okay what the crap
alright so let's do it let's do it
moving boxes from one shelf to the other
sake of the show also the quality looks
like crap they want better quality than
anyone else before well you know what I
don't know seven you know what I'll burn
your house down residents in a buttery
complex started running down the
hallways
oh that's exciting so man the staff
union eise's or so they think
I do not
EXO nips there werenít other word oh
okay um apparently sound it wasn't the
intent of the content yeah that actually
helps you on to it that's it you can
have like full nudity if it's not the
intent of the content really like if you
play corner on Exile there's people
running around dicks out boobs out
whatever right it's not the intent of
the game it's not the intent of the game
to have dicks and boobs out I mean like
there's a there's a main objective that
isn't that I think I think that's more
than what's going on cut got it makes
sense okay well like I want to watch it
now and I couldn't hear that so we're
gonna play the game we're totally gonna
play it again nice hold on
[Laughter]
all right now did you link the chat to
floatplane already I didn't okay well
you probably should we've got we've got
a lot of great stuff over on floatplane
right now
what do we have we archive the daily
live streams over there I'm just gonna
screen share with you guys we've got the
beanbag chair long jump which is like
okay I'm gonna ruin one moment it's not
actually the best moment but it's a
pretty epic moment where is it for some
reason it wasn't the intro I thought it
was an awesome intro where is it well
it's like it's like way in the video for
some reason here we go here we go here
we go here we go here we go here we go
almost a collision that was the thing oh
my goodness super scary
neither James nor I saw each other come
in yeah so we've got an episodes
comparing a $60 CPU to a $600 CPU uh and
the comparison is is less stupid than
you would probably think we've got a
tech quickie avoiding common PC building
traps episode four we've got three
reasons not to buy this four hundred
dollar laptop Dell is not gonna be
stoked on that one oh that's that's fun
I'm excited for that we've got the 1920
by 1080 meme PC oh we built it oh that's
funny we did we all we definitely did it
the 1920x1080 try and figure out what
hardware there's and that's in there
baby can I give him a hint uh sure it
came from a reddit thread from a like a
while ago
yeah someone tagged me in it and they
were like if anyone's gonna do it it's
you guys and I for it to Linus and was
like just an idea kind of a dumb idea
but but but it's also us let's do it
it's our kind of dumb idea
this actually ended up being a far more
informative video then you'd probably
think LTT MacBook Pro stands okay most
of them suck so we figured out which
ones suck and which ones are actually
decent which is good because even if you
don't have a MacBook Pro user for other
laptops you use them for any laptop yep
um organization vlog day three the
finale is up and what else we got yeah I
think that's I think that's pretty much
it yeah there might be yeah there might
be like one more on here because we we
released note eight simultaneously so
there's probably something here that I'm
not seeing but yeah that's pretty much
it
so thank you guys for tuning in to the
LAN show we've got a great show for you
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
yeah I'm tired I'm like actually tired
yo this week has been more frustrating
than usual so I had the whole thing
where I unwisely I admit decided to put
not clickbait in a title on one of our
videos yeah it wasn't clickbait I don't
let people hate that but people hate
that and they looks like some Paul ER
stuff right there they got some they got
they got consumed by the hating that and
certainly we ignored the video missed
the satire and missed that it was not
clickbait and then and then there was
like like after that there were people
talking about how clickbait the title of
the next day's video this Hyperloop pod
has real hover engines there's not
clickbait at all because it's a
Hyperloop pod and it has hover engines
and they're real and then there were all
the people kind of missing the point of
the Hyperloop video basically people
were mad because hyper loops are not
practical and they sort of missed the
part where it's an engineering
competition
and this isn't like a government
installing a nationwide train system
this is oh I haven't read the comments
but like let's just address that for a
moment it like if this is the US
government trying to install train
systems across the entire country and
forcing you to ride them and forcing you
to ride them and pay for them and pay
for them then you can like debate about
how practical they are this was an
engineering competition and it was
privately hosted and so why the hell do
you care I mean you can if you really
really want to get pedantic about it you
can talk about how Elon Musk's has
gotten a lot of government funding yeah
because he's done a lot of awesome stuff
and etcetera etc but basically that was
really frustrating there's been a lot of
hate on the tech quickie intro someone
is one of the chatted loose disappointed
in us I kind of am i come from a sciency
background and you have to try things
you constantly have to try things and if
you look at like the different
technologies that have come out of NASA
research for instance a lot of times
it's you try something and you go like
okay well maybe our actual main goal
wasn't it wasn't realized but through
messing with these magnets and trying to
cool down stuff that doesn't have air
flowing by it and trying to elevate
really really heavy objects and move
them really really quick on magnets we
learnt weird things about I don't know
I'm gonna pull a bunch of stuff up my
butt superconductors or or cooling
things without air and like all this
other kind of stuff that becomes helpful
in other areas doing things because of
learning is a very good thing so shush
so I thought it was a really cool piece
and basically people kind of crapped on
it and I was just like well I feel like
some of it was just that there's some
negative sentiment out there and I think
people were kind of finding something to
get upset about make sense I also think
that there's a lot of I think that a lot
of people feel felt like they were being
sold something even though they weren't
they were like this isn't gonna
okay so a lot of people drew parallels
between the Hyperloop and like the
Hyperloop competition video we made and
something like the solar freakin
roadways video but the difference is
that nobody is asking for your money so
that that's one huge difference and was
that not spend anything so they're like
debunked debunked and it's like debunked
and look in in a tone that was like
don't buy this it's been debunked but no
one's asking you to buy anything it's
just it's just it's a science a
competition so I feel like people were
people had sort of like a personal
investment in you know trying to save
other people from this thing that's
really bad when actually nobody is know
but then they're like yeah and the hype
like this one comment was particularly
ignorant and they're building it in
California and one of the most
earthquake-prone areas in the world
nobody is building it anywhere because
it isn't a thing it's an engineering
competition right now so that we can
like learn some stuff and weren't they
just okay I don't know but weren't they
just making the sled yeah they were just
making pods yeah and then they had a
one-mile test track that some teams got
to go down as fast as they could
yeah yeah anyways so that's where we're
at and then the note 8 video had an
error in it okay and we had to pull it
down even if it was debunked I don't
know but even if or if part of it was
debunked or whatever that's the point of
science like parts of it are thoroughly
debunked great but no one is trying to
build that like there's a lot of us I
talked about this a little bit last
night but it seems like the people
crying debunked are assuming that all of
the scientists and engineers at SpaceX
and all these universities haven't taken
a grade 11 physics course like like
they're not aware that sudden
decompression due to like a bullet hole
in the Hyperloop tube would be bad
and uh my biggest thing is like trying
things and failing and then trying again
and with with knowing how and why you
failed and growing from there is like
literally the whole point and retesting
things and other people challenging your
claims and all that kind of stuff is how
science worked so it it's completely
unhelpful yeah going oh look I theorized
these things and I think you're wrong
because of this data and I think this is
interesting because whatever great at
risk of getting a little offensive here
I feel like a lot of it is the science
as a religion crowd where they just kind
of go you know it's it's about it
becomes like a fanboy mentality like I
like I'm I got it I got to like defend
this because because science said it and
sometimes I feel like that gets that
energy it's the wrong those people think
they really like science and it's really
that they just really don't like other
things and they forget that the
scientific method is rather important
I'm gonna address one comment here
really quick
yeah ECU underscore 55 said we just want
review all capital letters on you we
just want reviews dr. Todd people are
tired of clickbait none of these things
have been clicked me you're just tired
of question that you don't want there's
a difference what should I review yeah
what's what's happening in the computer
world right now that has you raring to
go you've got a review of everything
that mattered in the last I don't know
we've got a review of the know date
we've got a review of all three variants
of Rison top four including thread
Ripper we've got a review of Scientology
is not science as a religion oh my god
sorry
wow that's a completely different so
science as a religion is taking a
faith-based approach to science yeah and
basically treating something science see
that somebody told you as fact without
worrying much about the method by which
we arrived there when like what science
is built on is questioning things and
trying things yeah
looking more deeply into stuff that's
what we mean by that it has nothing at
all to do with Scientology Scientology
is a cult boom I support that
how what was I talking about before that
though it seemed important sorry I don't
remember right yeah what are we supposed
to review oh yeah are we supposed to
review like yet another mother we jumped
on everything that's come out lately
super hard I mean I I know there's
people out there that really do want us
to review a motherboard but what exactly
would you expect us to say about it it's
pretty good man seems okay it's got to
RGB headers like it's pieces where all
the fan spots are its unboxings at that
point yeah and like they're honestly I
have a motherboard review coming
sometime in the next few weeks it'll be
as rocks X 299 Mini ITX board because
that is freaking cool but the the way to
this of it sorry someone in the chat
it's a blue except when I change it to
red yeah so that one's freaking cool and
whenever something freakin cool shows up
I'm and I'm gonna jump on it
another motherboard video that I'm gonna
have coming hopefully in the next little
bit is a soos released aboard with 19
PCI Express slots - that's crazy yeah
that's cool that's different and that's
something like even then it's not
unboxing because we're just gonna have
to find some weird way to do something
with yeah well it's some kind of mining
application or something we'll hook 19
GPUs up to it and you're out of town but
that's something interesting enough to
do something but that's the thing is you
guys gotta understand I can't make a
video that bores me what is the point
are you gonna like it if I say the same
thing that I that I'm always saying
what's what are the features of this
motherboard what are the features of a
motherboard it fits the other stuff that
you can buy
and connects it all also it's got a
great audio codec which is important and
RGB lighting which you may or may not
think is important um like a lot a huge
amount of motherboard stuff you could
find way more efficiently and in a
better format by just looking at the
spec sheet on the lips and I mean it's
tough too because even a lot of like non
IT stuff like phone stuff pretty
consolidated like with manufacturers
like HTC Nokia released a thing that's
people seem to care about LG's v30
people seem to kind of care about but
even like pixel two there's basically no
hype like we're pretty much down to a
half a dozen phone releases a year that
anyone really cares about server stuff
no no say what it's got more cores than
last year
which is good which is cool and if we
find a cool application for it okay
again I do have a plan with some of the
more recent server stuff I want to do
something with AMD epoch where we do a
half-a-dozen video editing workstations
running off of a single tower I think
that would be super cool there was a guy
by the way at PAX b-y-o-see
yeah I didn't enter ever get to meet him
but there's a guy there that's a fan of
Linus tech tips yeah and had one I
didn't notice it when I when I walked
past I was like that's a very
interesting computer and like kind of
looked at a little bit but then she just
kept walking by I didn't realize it was
two setups in one Tower nice it was an
unread build it was a beautiful black
and green which is not that common so I
love seeing them it lands black and
green beautiful looking unread builds
with his system on one side of the table
and someone else's on the other side of
the table night it was really cool and I
yeah I wish I actually got to talk to
him but um so yeah if we can find an
application for it like I guarantee you
something we're gonna do with the
upcoming Intel hire core count high-end
desktop parts expect to see an on raid
build where we do a streaming machine
and the gaming machine that goes with it
two discrete discrete function machine
in a single tower first track don't
alright so thanks for watching Rancho
we'll see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
like do more old stuff okay so the
problem with old stuff is there's a
finite amount of yeah inherently there
is a finite there is there will be more
coming
yeah there's moral and for at the very
least one more yeah like and that'll be
good
yeah all right thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
