a super tiny but full fledged Windows
computer well guess what there's a
sequel and it's in a black and gold box
and it comes out like this look
people like unboxings right look at this
thing it's bigger faster and better in
every possible way let's check it out
all right so now that our Windows Update
is done let's take a closer look at this
guy we've got some kind of rubberized
grips on the side here and here so that
you don't lose your grip we've got a
cooling fan got kind of a black-and-gray
aesthetic and then we can just I guess
open it up and get started so right out
of the box like spec wise this thing is
really impressive
the display is a six inch gorilla glass
topped H IPS 10-point multi-touch
display so it's 1280 by 720 which is not
amazing today but is good enough for a
device this size the processor is a core
m37 Y 30 so what's cool about that is
that that is not atom based
that's a 15 watt KB Lake that runs one
gigahertz base 2.6 gigahertz boost it's
got 2 cores and it's hyper threaded it's
running Intel HD graphics 615 so not the
most capable we'll look at it a little
closer later eight gigs of LP ddr3 RAM
it's got you can actually see it here on
the bottom support for up to a 42
millimeter n dot 2 though it should be
noted it runs a HDI not nvme it's got a
dual band AC Wi-Fi so I'd like to see
how it handles something like steam
in-home streaming and packed into this
you can see it's quite big it's got 2
4900 milliamp hour batteries for up to 6
to 8 hours of battery life I'm really
impressed with the IO 2 just like I was
last time around so here come come have
a look at this so you've got your USB
type-c
that handles charging duties and from
our testing also handles outputting to
like a USB C dongle so you could adapt
it to HDMI or an SD slot or whatever
else you want it's got a headphone jack
it's got a USB 3 type-a port it's got a
micro SD slot and it's also got a micro
HDMI output so if you wanted to hook it
up to a monitor or something then you
could totally do that
right now being totally honest the
speakers aren't great but apparently
this is mostly a driver issue that
they're already aware of this is a
pre-production sample and I'm more
concerned in the longer term with the
inputs the keyboard right off the bat
way improved over the last generation it
doesn't have a ton of flex to it and the
tactile click of the keys like actually
feels pretty good like it's not like I
type on it all day or anything but way
better than I expected and just like
last time this little switch right here
super handy so you change the joysticks
from gamepad mode over to Mouse mode and
all of a sudden boom there you go you're
moving your mouse cursor around it's not
you know a nipple and it's not a
trackpad but with a little bit of
practice you could definitely get really
good with this thing joystick quality
now that was really impressive
apparently these are sourced from the
Japanese company Alps which I totally
believe because they feel really good
like like like almost DS grade good and
as for the shoulder buttons here at
these are nice clicky buttons on our two
r1 and r3 now it should be noted that
these were a little hard to distinguish
especially at first from each other
while gaming but I do think it's
something that you might get used to
something that would take a little
longer to get used to as the weight this
thing is a touch heavy it's about 460
grams and making matters worse the
screen tilt is like just a little bit
too far this way then all the way this
way so I can't quite find myself in that
perfect comfortable in-between little
kind of snap out like that but okay
enough talk about hypotheticals let's
let's fire up some games one thing
that's really nice right out of the gate
on a device like this with steam in-home
streaming is if you have to make any
configuration changes or if you run into
any issues with it in general which
let's face it they're a thing it's a lot
easier to fix them and make any
adjustments on a full-fledged computer
than with you know something like a
shield portable which
as you guys probably know I'm a big fan
of this is basically what it looks like
running a game elsewhere on the network
over Wi-Fi so check this out
see those tips right there controller
disconnected spacebar okay boom we're in
PC mode hole d to drain Eric's for
health switch to gamepad mode and boom
it's working again already and all the
prompts will change again so that we
won't make any mistakes in terms of our
control scheme check that out beat a
drop so the idea here is that over your
home network using steam or even over
the Internet
assuming your connections good enough
using a service like parsec if you have
a powerful enough machine somewhere you
can play full quality games even though
the GPU on this thing really is not
nearly powerful enough to run games like
shadow of war so how bad you might ask
running things natively well integrated
graphics are still what they are so here
I've got a steam library running off of
this external 1 terabyte drive so I've
got a bunch of different games installed
and you're gonna see here that even in a
fairly indie game not super demanding
like gang beasts we're seeing occasional
stutters and this is running at 720p
actually not even apparently we're
running with pillar boxes for some
reason like to be clear it's not fair to
expect Deus Ex mankind divided to run
well you know even even at 720p on all
low settings but as long as you're
looking at kind of older games and you
don't expect to be getting a smooth 60
or 120 frames per second not that that
would matter it's a 60 Hertz display
it's not the worst thing ever
though I'd personally definitely prefer
to stream off something else if I'm
running something demanding emulation on
the other hand is the wind twos
wheelhouse so check this out this is
starfox assault running on a GameCube
emulator without any problems
60 FPS at the original resolution so
that's at 480 less demanding
can actually run enhanced @gp DS native
720p resolution and it goes pretty much
without saying that it works really well
for snez n64 PSX via retroarch but we
were actually pretty surprised to see
that it works reasonably well with
Playstation 2 games even at original
resolution again though now we did see
more than the occasional slowdown in
Grand Theft Auto for example but again
in less demanding games this shouldn't
be as much of a problem an input lag
overall was basically negligible okay so
what you're probably wondering at this
point sorry can I actually take that
from you enough Grand Theft Auto at work
what you're probably wondering at this
point is how much does one of these cost
well like its predecessor the win 2 is
pretty pricey so it's $600 while it's
running on its I don't remember which
crowdfunding campaign site it is but
while it's running its crowdfunding
campaign and then 700 after that but
it's got a lot of versatility and the
fact that there is a second one means
that there's clearly a market for these
devices out there because the first one
wasn't exactly cheap either speaking of
things that there's definitely a market
