of their new line of coolers okay this
is a high-performance cpu cooler it's
compatible with intel and AMD they say
it is an easy install kit which we will
find out in not too long from now the
heatsink materials aluminum it has eight
six millimeter heat pipes and I think
they're describing the way that it has
four heat pipes going through the base
and then each side goes up four times so
it's a total of eight effective heat
pipes by using this duel tower design it
uses a 120-millimeter pwm fan capable of
spinning from 702 2000 RPM and uses a
4-pin connector can power the fan CPU
support is everything so am too am too
plus am-3 lga775 LGA 1156 and LGA 1366
with a lot of these coolers performance
is so close these days it really does
come down to ease of installation the
weight that's being put on your cpu
socket and aesthetic factors other
things like that the intangibles so
overall I like the look of it already
let's go ahead and get this out of the
box i like that they've got a bit of a
darker finish on the aluminum that I'm
accustomed to seeing okay wow this is a
lot bigger than I had thought it was
based on the Box I thought that the box
was going to be sort of more packing
material and less cooler but there's a
whole lot of cooler in there so the
first thing we find inside is an
installation guide which is zero text it
is all picture I love it it must be
simple if they don't need to describe
anything on it's not even as many steps
as i thought the back is only two steps
so we're going to go ahead and figure
out the installation a little bit later
not in this video i'll be doing an
installation video of it hopefully
sometime this week let's have a look at
the mounting hardware that we have
included so first of all we have a back
plate then we have a 1366 back plate on
1156 back plate and these back plates
are kind of unique and that it looks
like you actually just taken adhesive
off you put those through the holes in
the back of the motherboard and there
you go so it antec saves on materials
and
everybody wins you save on the cost of
this particular heatsink and you don't
actually lose any structural integrity
here these should be just fine these are
quite thick pieces of metal even though
you're just using two strips on either
side of the back very innovative here's
an am2 bracket here 775 what is this for
them now just a minute and how does this
look okay well we'll figure that out in
the installation guide all these must be
the top pieces so some of these are back
plates some of them are top pieces and
we'll have to sort of sort that out
later here's a little wrench it's very
adorable some dynatron thermal compound
and then we have two sets of thumb
screws one for AMD and one for Intel so
I'm going to go ahead and assume the AMD
one just uses the stock and be back late
and these Intel ones are threaded for
the antec packets that are included now
let's have a look at the cooler box
itself you can see right here it does
use a direct touch mechanism for the
bottom so you're not going to be able to
demonstrate that it's completely flat
because that's not really the point of
these but i'll do the obligatory finger
shot thing anyway that everyone always
contains about you know what too bad it
seems to be machined quite flat there
are some slight ridges between the heat
pipes and the aluminium bits in between
but that is to be expected they're quite
shiny heat pipes I've seen shiny ones
and not shiny ones I don't know that it
makes any difference to cooling
performance whatsoever in fact I suspect
it doesn't but that doesn't really
matter they've kindly labeled the
airflow for you on this one so here we
go let's have a look at the fins first
of all the fins are what i would
consider about a medium density so
they're not super tight but they're also
not super wide so that means that you're
going to have you're going to have to
have a fan that finds a good balance of
static pressure to pure CFM in between
now and tech is using what appears to be
a custom fan and I don't know if you're
going to be able to replace it so that
could be a slight problem for people who
like to replace the stock fans that are
cluded with their heat sinks although I
mean depending how well this one
performs there may be no need to replace
it the top uses the the tower heat sinks
on either side and then it uses a metal
and I love to see that this is made
actually I think it's metal what's metal
right yeah it's metal I think yeah it's
metal it uses a metal plate on top with
an antec logo I'm so nah I don't not a
big fan of seeing like plastic bits all
over and while they do use plastic for
the fan shroud that doesn't matter to me
nearly as much because when this is
installed in my case it looks like this
I don't really see this part but I do
see the nice brushed finish that they
have on that antec logo on the top and I
guess there's not really too much else
to say about it at this point you can
see that the fan blades do stick down a
little bit below where the fins of the
heatsink actually reach and so I'm
guessing what you're going to get is a
little bit of incidental airflow that's
going to cool these little heat sink
fins down here thats it directly over
the CPU and it's also going to do a fair
bit of cooling for the motherboard
components that are around the cpu
socket so a good example of that would
be these pwm heat sinks that you'll find
on our vrm PWM whatever you want to call
them the voltage regulator heat sinks
you find on many motherboards should
receive a little bit of incidental air
flow from that something that you don't
get with a lot of tower heat sinks so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the antec kuhler box I'll be hoping
to bring you some cooling results as
well as an installation video in the
next little while</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
