of their new line of coolers okay this
is a high-performance CPU cooler it's
compatible with Intel and AMD they say
it is an easy install kit which we will
find out in not too long from now the
heatsink material is aluminum it has
eight six millimeter heat pipes and I
think they're describing the way that it
has four heat pipes going through the
base and then each side goes up four
times so it's a total of eight effective
heat pipes by using this duel tower
design it uses a 120 millimeter pwm fan
capable of spinning from 700 to 2,000
rpm and uses a four pin connector to
power the fan CPU support is everything
so a.m. 2 a.m. 2 plus a.m. three LGA 775
LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 with a lot of
these coolers performance is so close
these days it really does come down to
ease of installation the weight that's
being put on your CPU socket and
esthetic factors other things like that
the intangibles so overall I like the
look of it already let's go ahead and
get this out of the box I like that
they've got a bit of a darker finish on
the aluminum that I'm accustomed to
seeing ok wow this is a lot bigger than
I had thought it was based on the box I
thought that the box was going to be
sort of more packing material and less
cooler but there's a whole lot of cooler
in there so the first thing we find
inside is an installation guide which is
zero text it is all picture I love it
it must be simple if they don't need to
describe anything on it's not even as
many steps as I thought the back is only
two steps so we're gonna go ahead and
figure out the installation a little bit
later not in this video I'll be doing an
installation video of it hopefully
sometime this week let's have a look at
the mounting hardware that we have
included so first of all we have a
backplate then we have a 1366 backplate
on 1156 backplate and these back plates
are kind of unique and that it looks
like you actually just taken adhesive
off you put those through the holes in
the back of the motherboard and there
you go so it Antec saves on materials
and
everybody wins you save on the pot so
this particular heatsink and you don't
actually lose any structural integrity
here these should be just fine these are
quite thick pieces of metal even though
you're just using two strips on either
side of the back very an innovative
here's an AM two bracket here seven
seven five well what is this for them
now just a minute and how does this look
okay well we'll figure that out in the
installation guide oh these must be the
top pieces so some of these are back
plates some of them are top pieces and
then we'll have to sort of sort that out
later
here's a little wrench it's very
adorable some dinah Tron thermal
compound and then we have two sets of
thumb screws one for AMD and one for
Intel so I'm gonna go ahead and assume
the AMD one just uses the stock and Eve
athlete and these Intel ones are
threaded for the antique fabrics that
are included now let's have a look at
the cooler box itself you can see right
here it does use a direct touch
mechanism for the bottom so you're not
going to be able to demonstrate that
it's completely flat because that's not
really the point of these but I'll do
the obligatory finger shop thing anyway
that everyone always contains about you
know what too bad it seems to be
machined quite flat there are some
slight ridges between the heat pipes and
the aluminum bits in between but that is
to be expected
they're quite shiny heat pipes I've seen
shiny ones and not shiny ones I don't
know that it makes any difference to
cooling performance whatsoever in fact I
suspect it doesn't but that doesn't
really matter they've kindly labeled the
airflow for you on this one so here we
go let's have a look at the fins first
of all the fins are what I would
consider about a medium density so
they're not super tight but they're also
not super wide so that means that you're
gonna have you're gonna have to have a
fan that finds a good balance of static
pressure to pure CFM in between now
Antec is using what appears to be a
custom fan and I don't know if you're
going to be able to replace it so that
could be a slight problem for people who
like to replace the stock fans that are
pleaded with their heatsinks although I
mean depending how well this one
performs there may be no need to replace
it the top uses the the tower heat sinks
on either side and then it uses a metal
and I love to see that this is made
actually I think it's metal
what's metal right yeah it's metal I
think that's metal it uses a metal plate
on top with an antic logo I'm so nah I
don't not a big fan of seeing like
plastic bits all over and while they do
use plastic for the fan shroud that
doesn't matter to me nearly as much
because when this is installed in my
case it looks like this I don't really
see this part but I do see the nice
brushed finish that they have on that
antec logo on the top and I guess
there's not really too much else to say
about it at this point you can see that
the fan blades do stick down a little
bit below where the fins of the heatsink
actually reach and so I'm guessing what
you're gonna get is a little bit of
incidental airflow that's gonna cool
these little heatsink fins down here
that sit directly over the CPU and it's
also gonna do a fair bit of cooling for
the motherboard components that are
around the CPU socket so a good example
of that would be these PWM heat sinks
that you'll find on our vrm PWM whatever
you want to call them the voltage
regulator heat sinks you find on many
motherboards should receive a little bit
of incidental airflow from that
something that you don't get with a lot
of tower heat sinks so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the enttec
cooler box I'll be hoping to bring you
some cooling results as well as an
installation video in the next little
while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
