it turned out there were a number of
different issues including us using fan
controller inline modules that weren't
compatible with these particular PWM
fans as well as the fact that our unit
was an engineering sample unit that had
a bit of a problem with it so we have
been working with Swift TAC on what the
heck happened where our test unit
performed terribly with Swift Tech's own
helix fans and performed admirably with
third-party fans like the Noctua n FF
12s and we committed to Swift tech as
well as to our viewers to redo our
testing much more in depth and take a
very close look at how the H 220
performs on our test bench with all the
variables being eliminated as best as
possible so I'm gonna start with a look
at our cooling test bench we use a
closed platform we do not use an open
test bench for cooler reviews anymore
because this is more of a real-world
scenario alright so we use a corsair c
70 case which represents an above
average case for cooling
hey there's my screwdriver i was looking
for that dang it slick alright I guess
I'll leave it here but anyway okay we
use a real system inside with a GTX 580
that runs fir mark during our load tests
that we create heat inside the system so
that it's more like a real system would
be if you're actually playing a game we
have two fans here that run at 1100 our
rather at crap I forget the rpm but they
run at 7 volts we have a fan back here
that runs at 1100 rpm and is held on
with rubber washers so that's why it
just popped off just now 16 gigs of RAM
we found our coolers in the top or the
back depending on what kind of coolers
they are you can see we've got swift Tex
PWM splitter over here making sure we're
running everything properly
power supply 32 gig SSD because that's
all you really need we collect our
ambient temperatures here at the front
of the case and then we we log them with
this and then we correct all of our
results - as if the room was 20 degrees
Celsius the last thing that's of note is
when we're not running fans at full
speed we're using this variable resistor
in here in order to run our fans at
1,100 rpm we can dial them into exactly
eleven hundred rpm using software rpm
monitoring and this guy right here
however it should be noted running pwm
fans such as the helix ones there could
be adverse effects to the longevity of
the fan running it using voltage control
so we're only doing that for the sake of
eliminating variables not because we
actually recommend running them this way
alright so back to the age to 20 we did
idle and load comparison so idle is at
idle giving it time to equalize and load
is that load giving it you know 15 20
minutes to equalize and normalize the
temperature we ran corsair SP series
fans though so those are on there right
now that was the last one we did but
this is what they look like okay they're
quiet addition fans not performance
addition we ran Swift Texan helix fans
in both push and pull / swift text
requests because they ship them in pole
configuration but we test all of our
cool are they ship them in push rather
but we test all of our configurations in
pull because I believe it's better
because it's easier to clean whereas
when you have them in push the dust all
accumulates under the fans so you have
to take the fans off in order to clean
them what we discovered is they
performed exactly the same in push and
pull which is what I've said was going
to happen so we didn't even need a
different data point on the graph to
show those two results but they were
exactly the same so consider these poll
results or push results whatever you
want
we ran switch over stones new ap 123 air
penetrator fans with the three different
blade sizes that should make them more
optimized for quiet hey slick how are
they in terms of acoustics super quiet
awesome okay good I mean I guess I kind
of expected that and we ran our golden
standard our well our brown and tan
standard I suppose not to a 10 ff12 s
which are the ones that we use as our
standardized test bench for testing fans
because we believe that they're awesome
and as your
about to see they're just freaking
awesome so what we saw the first time
around was that at load our n FF 12s
were outperforming the hilux fans by
like ten or fifteen degrees or something
like that we looked at it we were like
this is impossible we retested it and we
got the same results so we published it
but we were wrong we made some mistakes
so these are the proper results we've
tested our fans at full speed as well as
at 1,100 rpm and we've included some
other coolers for reference as well so
the best-performing solution was the h2
20 with n FF twelves running at full
speed bear in mind these only run at
around 1400 1450 rpm at full speed
whereas the Hilux is rendered around
1800 rpm at full speed so the fact that
they outperformed the helixes is very
admirable the Hilux is however did pull
ahead of the air penetrators as well as
Corsairs static pressure fans but those
ones also run at lower rpm than the
hilux fans so the hilux fans have a very
wide range of RPM in part due to their
pwm design as well as due to the design
of the motor overall which is able to
start up at very low speeds as well as
run at very high speed which is a great
flexible option it's good to have
alright so at full speed it goes 54.5 n
FF 1256 h2 2050 8.5 for both of the
other fan solutions then we took all the
fans and we put them on a level playing
field 1,100 rpm only the n FF twelves
won by almost three degrees about two
and a half degrees which is outstanding
considering that they're running at the
same rpm as everything else they're very
pressure optimized they perform
incredibly well up against a radiator in
addition to being very quiet so we're
going to be continuing to use the n FF
12s as our Brown and tan standard well
golden standard fan next up was Corsairs
static pressure fans which were tied
with the air penetrators again at a
lower rpm so those we can consider very
equivalent designs and then bringing up
the rear was the helix fans but they
were only one degree away from the
static pressure and air penetrator fans
and we can consider about one degree to
be not that significant of a difference
in terms of performance however the
three two and a half degree victory is a
clear victory for the n FF
twelve after that we finally find other
coolers so get this you guys the age to
twenty regardless of which fans you put
on it performs better than anything else
because are the water 2.0 extreme from
Thermaltake is our next best performing
cooler three degrees behind the worst
configuration for the h2 20 then there's
the H 110 which is another almost a
degree behind that then there's the H
100 I which is another almost degree
behind that and then we get down to the
single 120 millimeter coolers like the H
atir sorry that was another 4 degrees or
5 degrees behind the H 110 and then the
H Adi brings up the rear at like 95
degrees so not all liquid coolers are
built equal not all fans are built equal
but it's very clear to me that no matter
how in equally built your fan is the h2
20 is the best prefilled liquid cooler
on the market almost no matter how hard
you try to cripple it I mean we didn't
cripple it by using the included fans
but we didn't give it a huge advantage
like we do with every other cooler by
putting some of the best fans on the
market on them thank you for checking
out this corrected edition of Linus tech
tips on the you know I don't even held
up the product at all so here's the box
is what it's actually gonna look like if
you buy it see we have a retail sample
now of the h2 20 from Swift tech don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos and if you haven't seen it
already
we did a build log a little while ago
and a silverstone TJ 10 where we used
the h2 20 we expanded it we added a GPU
block as well as another radiator and
that is the other advantage of the h2 20
so 3 year warranty expandability and the
best performance on the market in spite
of the fact that it's using a dual 120
millimeter fan radiator instead of a
dual 140 millimeter fan radiator like
the H 110 which still gets outperformed
by at least 4 degrees and with the same
fans it looks like 110 is about 8
degrees Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
