not actually what it appears to be so I
wish I could show you guys the correct
retail packaging for the Antec 302 but
my sample arrived before they actually
had and I'm very sorry that this
unboxing even late but before they had a
302 box or it maybe it didn't that was
my assumption but inside so what they've
done is they've doubled boxed it so that
no one involved in the transportation
process could have known that something
so top-secret was being shipped via
courier and then opened it up to see the
secrets inside that's probably not how
it went down okay so the 302 is as you
may or may not be able to figure out on
your own and upgrade to the enormous Lee
successful and tech 300 if you've ever
gone to a land event what you probably
notice is that other than an Tek 900 and
300s everything else is kind of like a
few here and a few there between those
two they are what you could label sort
of the gamers choice because they
especially at the time that we're first
introduced had great features great
build quality and very reasonable price
points so the 302 actually I still need
this for a sec the 302 is aa
the 302 brings into the year 2012
everything that was good about the 300
before including the value optimized
price point the excellent cooling
options and adds a few things that were
maybe missing with the 300 given how old
of a design that that one was so I'm
going to show you guys what an 10 has to
say for themselves before I get into the
case myself so up to 12 and a half
inches of expandability maximum cooling
we'll cover that later ease of use so
tool is three and a half and five and a
quarter inch base front panel USB three
that we'll get into more later a
washable PSU air filter and front intake
filter eight expansion slots for up to
XL ATX motherboards with eight slots so
this particular one for example the x79
UD seven does have eight slots but ones
like the gigabyte assassin 4 X 58 have
nine so watch out for that excel ATX is
not a real standard okay side cooling
fan cable routing holes behind the
motherboard tray okay let's have a look
at the outside before we open this baby
up so for one thing you can see the
front has got a bit of a curved
appearance to it so don't worry the bays
are still straight so you're gonna have
that very clean look even if you install
optical drives you're not going to have
you know how some cases have like curved
front bezels and then you install a flat
optical drive and it looks kind of goofy
because the rest of its curved and there
looks out of place so they haven't done
that they've just done a curved look on
the side looks very slick actually two
USB 3.0 ports microphone headphones
reset switch is very hard to
accidentally press you can see even if I
push on it like this I can't really
press it you got to get right in there
and push it in order to reset your
system this is awesome because the last
thing you want to do is accidentally
reset your system with your Neil I'm in
the middle of a game this is a gaming
case after all so they have to consider
things like that we've got our hard
drive cages and that's pretty much it
for the front I mean the antique 300 was
a very classic looking case and they've
gone that route again with the 302 now
this is interesting
more on this once we open up the case
but there's a 120 millimeter cooling fan
spot on the motherboard sigh
of the inside of the case so yes yes
more on that later
yes indeed we have a 140 millimeter
cooling fan in the top as well as a
couple water cooling grommets although
most people probably won't use these hey
you never know they could if you did
want to do an external water cooling
setup it's handy to not have to punch
holes in your case or use those horrible
PCI bracket pass-throughs that usually
the tubing doesn't even like fit
properly through so let's take the side
panel off inside we find it does not
have a black interior although it's up
to the individual user whether or not
that matters I've always thought it's a
little bit silly to do a black interior
on a case that doesn't have a window
anyway but to each his own oh we should
look at the back of the case before we
wrap up here so here are our eight
expansion slots bottom mounted power
supply 120 millimeter cooling fan as
well as speed adjusters for both this
120mm fan and the 140 millimeter fan in
the top these are too cool fans which
means you have low and high rpm settings
on the inside of the case we find a
number of things so we find the power
supply filter which actually locks in
place okay that's kind of handy there
you go so you can take that out clean it
off put it back in and it comes out the
side this is a very smart design
decision because when you're set up at
your okay here here I'm going to put
this where it would be so this would be
next to my monitor and so I got all my
cables coming out of the back of the
system and my monitors here and so many
cases implement the fan filters back
here how am I going to reach this my
face is in my monitor now I have to take
my case I have to hope that I don't pull
on my cables too hard if they put it on
the side all of a sudden it's much
easier for me to get it out all I have
to do is take my face angle a little bit
I can get it out no problem
back to the interior so pretty much a no
frills interior although they've done a
nice big CPU cutout and now let's talk
about this right here so this is a 120
millimeter cooling fan spot that's on
the other side of the motherboard tray
why why you may ask well check out this
gaming motherboard there are actual CPU
vrm components on the back of the mother
bored that in addition to the fact that
any modern motherboard has a ton of
copper content in it so it is actually
conducting a lot of heat away from the
CPU just out here through the PCB itself
if you ever touch the back of a
motherboard it's quite hot that allows
an tech 302 users to install an
additional 120 mill fan back there use
it as an exhaust and pull some of this
heat away from the back of a motherboard
alternately I guess you could use it as
an intake and blow the air directly at
the back of the motherboard if you want
more of a positive air pressure thing
going on in your case to keep dust out
that's not really sure how I would do it
I guess since it's got filtered intakes
I would probably use it as exhaust but I
mean the choice is yours so here are our
three tool is five and a quarter inch
bays and here are the mounting pieces
for our six tool-less
three and a half inch bays there's
actually not a whole lot here in terms
of frills and gimmicks so I'm not going
to bother taking it out but you got your
screws and your hard drive rails and oh
actually okay I will take this out give
me a sec well unfortunately they're not
the same ones that were included with
the 11-hundred so I'm not going to do
the demo where I left oh thanks well I
guess I can okay I don't think they're
the same ones but it's actually fairly
secure so once you put these on all you
do is slide your drive until it locks
there's no screws involved whatsoever
and it's pretty darn secure once it's in
there another thing to note about an Tek
cases is even when they have a value
case or a budget case or whatever it is
you want to call it the build quality is
always there and this is not always true
cases that might look flashy or have
more features and this is this is just
me Linus personally talking to you guys
right now and I want to just I'm not
going to name any names when I talk
about their competitors but not all
event X competitors would have built the
three and a half inch hard drive cage
like this see the way they have folded
over the metal so that there's
absolutely no chance of any kind of a
rough edge not only does that improve
the the usability of the case by making
it safer it also adds structural
strength to it the other thing they've
done is this is just a design thing it's
not like the metals more expensive but
the way they've done the cutouts here
also gives this
Norma's amount of strength I have seen
cases damaged and shipping to the point
where this is bent so much that a hard
drive slid in here would just fall right
out or like go to the side because it
doesn't even catch on these rails
anymore but I really have never seen
that with an antic case so there you go
guys
ss Dino we've got a two to half inch SSD
mount in the bottom personally I would
prefer to have seen a tooless three and
a half inch mechanism that allows you to
install more SSDs but it's not the end
of the world and it looks like we've got
another SSD mount on the other side of
the motherboard tray so you can put you
can put that one hiding this one I like
I like hiding SSDs behind the
motherboard that's awesome so uh what
else we got here oh let's look at the
front fan filter haven't even shown that
yet so there's a couple clips here on
the front I'm gonna go ahead pull that
off so a front fan filter is yeah yes
there we go
comes off somehow oh there we go
so it's just these little tips right
here and you pull it out like that there
we go
so that can be cleaned fairly quickly
fairly easily pop that back in place
once I figured out how to do it that's
actually quite quick pop this back on
help please go into the hinge first
there we go and I think that pretty much
covers it is there anything I'm missing
so we already covered the 12 and a half
inch thingamabob urgh alright the cable
management on the back and slicks gone
ahead and turned it so that he can see
it so he could remind me of something
but I have a cheat sheet over there as
well hmm ha so there you go aha cable
management so cable management is
something where the 302 just blows away
its predecessor look at this three
centimeters of space on the back of the
motherboard tray that means you can
actually route a 24 pin cable without
any hassle you've got one two three we
could call that a cable management spot
and I could potentially call that a
cable management spot okay it's going to
be hard to count these both for major
ones and then you can see they've got
this extra room up here for your eight
pin right there
and then they've also got a little one
here for front audio or USB 3 or
whatever else speaking of which the
included cables are right here so it
does have an internal USB 3 header for
those two USB 3 front ports very high
quality cable actually that's good to
see
and then how you look at this hey black
and gray which happens to be the color
scheme of the case power reset and front
panel switches and there's our front
panel audio so that's the kind of thing
I would run through here in order to
make it more more hidden also cable
management spots on the back you can use
the included zip ties to hem there we go
anchor your cables to these and then tie
them up tight so that when you put the
other side panel back on you don't have
any trouble fitting it into place I
think that pretty much wraps up the 302
for me don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and I
do have one more thing to say check this
out they thought of everything there's a
vent right here so that means that
whether you're doing intake or exhaust
the air is actually going to have
somewhere to go on that fan that's on
the back of the motherboard train yeah
don't forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
