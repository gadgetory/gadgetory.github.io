how much money you save per year going
with a 5400 rpm drive or a 50 900 rpm
drive versus a 7200 rpm drive that is
optimized for power efficiency at least
that is what Seagate is claiming is the
reason that they are switching from
having a green or an eco-friendly
optimized lower rpm lower performance
storage drive and then a middle of the
range sort of still purely magnetic
storage so sort of Seagate strategy
going forward it's going to be a little
bit different but having a green Drive
versus a 7200 rpm somewhat performance
drive and then a higher-end drive so in
the past they had the Barracuda fifty
nine hundred rpm Drive they had the
Barracuda 7200 rpm Drive and then they
had the Barracuda XT which was a 7200
rpm Drive with better performance more
tuning etc etc well now Seagate is doing
away with that three-tiered approach and
they are going with only a single peer
magnetic drive at least sometime in the
future so right now they still have the
Barracuda this is an eval unit so tenth
the labeling on it and they're still
going to have the Barracuda XT but the
XT is going to be a hybrid Drive in the
future and they're completely doing away
with the lower rpm Drive because Seagate
says that for the savings and for the
performance reduction it is simply not
worth the slight decrease in cost that a
5400 or 50 900 rpm Drive provides
because in terms of manufacturing
they're actually very very similar also
in terms of the testing and validation
process they take longer to validate
because they spin slower so you actually
on the manufacturing level are not
really saving very much money at all so
there we go
this is codename Granada this is a 7200
rpm this is going to be the Barracuda
Drive moving forward and then there will
be the Barracuda XT at some point in the
future it has a 64-bit cache which is
all fine and good but what's really
thing about this drive is the fact that
Seagate now has one terabyte platters so
what do one terabyte platters mean one
terabyte platters mean that your two
terabyte drive is going to be faster due
to the increased density of the data
storage on the drive so it's going to be
faster than your old two terabyte drive
and it's also going to be more reliable
than your old two-tire byte drive and
the reason for that is that it actually
has fewer parts inside so fewer points
of failure compared to a drive that has
a ton of platters and a ton of read
heads in order to achieve the capacity
that it has achieved now in terms of the
actual physical drive itself you're
going to notice this looks an awful lot
like a standard three and a half inch
drive you got your SATA power you got
your SATA 6 gigabits per second or six
yeah six gigabit per second 600 megabit
per second no six gave it per second you
wrote 600 megabit per second Oh
either way you've got your SATA three
six gigabit per second interface here
you got a couple little jumpers there
you got your standard mounting holes all
that good stuff so what is this really
about this video isn't really about the
unboxing or D bagging of this particular
Drive this is more about C gates refocus
on what is best for the consumer so what
they're saying is you know what and not
for this 20 cents of savings per year
nonsense because honestly you're
probably losing far more than that in
terms of productivity just waiting
around for your data to be accessed
let's not you know charge more for the
performance drive if it costs as much to
manufacture and it uses as much power
almost it's actually slightly less power
efficient than a low rpm drive but let's
not charge more for it if it doesn't
actually cost us more to produce so
they're going ahead they're saying let's
simplify things for the consumer we're
going to have one drive in a variety of
capacities and then on the performance
side we're going to do hybrid drives
we're going to add caching to them
they're going to be legitimately much
higher performance than a standard 7200
rpm drive and that's the only
differentiation that they're going to
have so I say thumbs up to Seagate for
simplifying things for the consumer and
simplifying things that really add every
level at their a level at the retailer
level they don't have to have
any scuse you want a hard drive here's a
hard drive you want a hybrid drive
here's a hybrid drive that's pretty much
it so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the barracuda CDU unit so I
don't know what that stands for but now
