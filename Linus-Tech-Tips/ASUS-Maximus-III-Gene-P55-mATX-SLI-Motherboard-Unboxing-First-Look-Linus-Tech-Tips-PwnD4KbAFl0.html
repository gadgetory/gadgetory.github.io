look at the Maximus 3 Jean this is part
of the Seuss's Republic of gamers line
of motherboards so it includes cool
features like ROG connect plugin
overclocked we get the hardcore way
whatever that means
men perfect which is optimizing your
memory without lifting a finger actually
I've never heard of either of these but
what are you gonna do them ok this one I
know this is the button that you press
to make sure that you run any memory at
bone-stock settings at kind of a safe
setting to make sure that you can post
and then after you post you can tweak
the memory afterwards okay you've got
supreme FX x5 built in so it includes
all of those high-end features but what
we haven't shown you is that this is a
micro ATX motherboard so this is part of
their LGA 1156 line of motherboard so it
supports core i7 and Core i5 it also
supports core i3 although I can't
imagine buying a really expensive board
like this and putting a core i3 on it it
does support SLI and crossfire so if
you're doing like a small extreme gaming
rig like in a Sugo or another small
form-factor case this would be a perfect
motherboard for it it's Windows 7 ready
and we'll flip it around to the back
where it says basically the same thing
as it said on the inside so why don't we
get this box opened up and have a look
so the first thing we find inside is the
motherboard BAM just like that like all
of their republic of gamers boards it
has a very very cool catchy color scheme
but we're gonna actually take it away
from you ha look at the accessories
first so we have a USB cable ok thank
you for that just your standard a 2a
there's got to be something in here
plugs into there's no reason for that
SLI bridge remember if you need a
crossfire bridge it should come with
your video card ok then you've got some
zip ties for cable management
you've got the users guide as well as
the ok this is interesting so you've got
a user's guide you've got a drivers and
installation DVD as well as a Republic
of gamers sticker don't use this DVD
download the latest off asus calm
alright and then this is neat so they've
included little stickers for labeling
your hard drives so and color coded to
so that way you don't have to when
you've routed all of your cables through
the case you don't have to fuss around
with which one connects to which drive
so you can make a little label like oh
this is my
750 gig and this is my 500 gig and this
is my SSD very cool and then your users
guide is all English and very thick so
I'm not even gonna try to go through
that alright then we have a huge
Republic of gamers sticker that goes all
the way over to the to the other side
here and it's kind of come off a little
bit hopefully we can get that off
without damaging it too much okay there
you go so that's I guess for your case
window alright very nice then you have
your iof shield which is their black
premium looking i/o shield with the kind
of poofy shiny stuff on the back then we
have six SATA cables three of which are
right angle and three of which are
straight and then we have our Q
connectors okay so I don't actually see
what that USB cable is for but I guess
we'll get to that later so here's the
Maximus - Jean like all p55 motherboards
and I hope I mentioned its p55 you do
have support for an LGA 1156 socket and
you do have support for dual channel
ddr3 memory and you should use the
color-coded slots this board does have a
Seuss's unique feature where this side
of the memory mod slot is not a clip
only the other side is an actual clip so
what you do is you slide the memory in
this side with the clip open push it
down and clip it shut with just one side
it's in theory makes installing memory a
little bit easier your power connectors
are in their ideal locations at the top
left corner of the board where you have
an 8 pin power and then over on the
right-hand edge of the board where you
have your 24-pin power one thing that I
really like that asus is doing with
their Republican gamer boards is they're
starting to include way more for pin fan
connectors so if you look at this board
we've got 1 2 3 4 5 4 pin power
connectors so that means you can PWM
control all the fans in your case
without any additional hassle we've got
2 PCI Express 16x slots that will run at
8 X 8 X if you're running in crossfire
one PCI Express 4 X and one PCI slot for
expansion you've got kind of a little
cover here on the chipset that looks
pretty neat it's got like a mesh here so
that gets a little bit of ventilation
and then you've got your onboard start
and reset buttons you got the premium
ones that look kind of like cool then
you've got - I was
gonna say too but I guess it's three USB
headers and here is a plug for the OSI
station which I believe is available
separately it doesn't actually come with
it
here's your onboard supreme x5 FX and
let me see if I'm missing anything here
oh yeah yeah over on this side okay so
you've got six SATA cables running off
the chipset and one additional one here
running off a third-party chipset here
is your go button I think that's the mem
ok button actually I hope it is anyway
alright so let's go around to the back
and we'll find out why we have like a
random lone SATA port here and I'm gonna
assume it's because yes there's eSATA on
the back of the board so that's where
the other SATA port from that controller
is you've got a ps2 keyboard port then
you've got one two three four eight USB
2.0 ports as well as another USB port
here which I guess is what that cable
was for it must do something specific
something to do with this I think it's
their little overclocking thing okay and
then you've got a CMOS clear switch I
love this this is great means you don't
have to fish around in your case
especially because it's a micro ATX
board that's going to be a real hassle
so you can just press this to clear the
CMOS digital audio is provided by
optical only then you've got firewire
eSATA Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio
those look like gold plated connectors
too so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Maximus 3 Jean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
