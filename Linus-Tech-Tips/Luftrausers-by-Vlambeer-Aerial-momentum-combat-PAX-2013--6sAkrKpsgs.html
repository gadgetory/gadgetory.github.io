brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series hey guys i'm here with
a company from the netherlands called
Vlambeer with their game loop flower did
I say that correctly yeah LaRose okay
awesome this game is really interesting
because it's like no other aerial combat
game I've ever played it's really really
hard to describe actually pretty much
impossible but the main way I can do it
is to say that you're flying around and
you can easily change direction by
flipping because you have to activate
your thrusters whatever the heck you
want to call it you're the power on your
plane and then you can let go and flip
around however you want and burst in
another direction the whole time while
shooting the whole time will under
attack playing this game makes you feel
like an absolute badass and when you're
done you feel like you suck because you
didn't hit anything that you actually
wanted to and you didn't complete the
goals you wanted to you but it's so much
fun they have to play it again it's one
of those games you want people to watch
you because you feel so badass all your
playing is there anything else you can
tell me about this game well no I guess
that is pretty that was pretty much the
idea of the game is to make you feel
like the best fighter fighter in the
world I then sort of make you realize
that you're probably not it's a game of
Master eats about game about getting
better at something and it's yeah it's
hard to describe the feeling of like
changing momenta the game that we've
been working on for a while now and to
hear people get it like that is super
exciting that's awesome and like he said
it's a game to get better at that's for
sure because the second I was done the
first round I wanted to play again
because I was like no I can do that
better i know i can dodge that in a
different way i can flip this way and
first back and i'll dodge that and kill
this guy and but then every time you
jump back in it's different and the
planes can be different too there's a
bunch of customizability can you tell me
more about that yeah so there's 125
different air pressure can build you can
change the engine the wings the weapons
and the body and depending on the
airplane you build do you have a
completely different playstyles some
airplanes can go underwater some of
homing missiles summit lasers so much
body armor so there's a whole wealth of
a place you can build every one of them
has a unique soundtrack and a unique
name so if you build a different
airplane to music for the game changed
as well it's really it's really a way
for us to sort of play around with how
people play a game and also allow them
to get better at something they like
instead of just foreign to do
one specific thing so it's a fun thing
it's fun thing to play around with the
experiment with that's that's so true
because when I was playing I played a
few different planes but my favorite one
was as you were saying one that could go
underwater and one that could shoot
missiles because I'd I jump out of the
water flip around like crazy and shoot
missiles and then run away and get back
underwater again and i found that to
work really well for me but who knows
what will work for you there's 125
combinations like he just said you
should definitely try them all out how
can someone get this game so the game is
no jet but it's going to be out soon
it's going to be releasing on pc mac and
linux through steam it will be available
through the humble widget and it will
launch on playstation 3 and playstation
vita simultaneously with the pc release
that's awesome so you can pretty much
get it almost any way you want and you
should because this game looks epic and
if you're one of those kind of people
that play games with other friends this
is an awesome spectator sport game thank
