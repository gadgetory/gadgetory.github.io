gigabyte ARS x7 it was groundbreaking
for a few reasons number one was that
was incredibly thin for a full-powered
gaming notebook number two was that it
featured not one but two graphics cards
and finally I was incredibly impressed
by the cooling and acoustics that
gigabyte had achieved when you factor in
how thin it was a global leader in tech

okay so there was a bunch of other cool
stuff as well the all aluminum housing
white backlit keyboard that's actually
surprisingly nice to type on the
flexible storage arrangement and
surround monitor gaming support made
this a solid easy to recommend product
for me but that's all old news
fast-forward to today and the x7 has got
a bit of a facelift now instead of a 3.4
gigahertz turbo CPU we get a few point 5
gigahertz turbo CPU instead of ddr3 1600
megahertz forget 1866 megahertz the
macro functions buttons programmable
buttons on the side are now called the
macro engine programmable buttons on the
side and the power adapter has been
boosted from 180 watts to 200 ok so far
nothing that impressive but then things
get interesting this new model now
supports up to 3m SATA SSDs and raid 0
and/or raid whatever you want I guess
and it still has a tuna 1/2 inch drive
bay for either an additional SSD or a
hard drive that's a lot of storage but
still not the main event no the big
change is the graphics cards instead of
dual GTX 760 5 ms the updated x7 has
dual gtx 860m 4 gig cards which should
amount to a real world performance
improvement of 20% or more and has
gigabyte making some pretty serious
claims about how they're upgraded ARS
seven can run with the big dogs and even
beat the gtx 880 em conveniently we have
the excellent a since g 750 jz in-house
which features and only slightly slower
CPU and a four gig gtx 880 m so let's
find out if it's happened in a notebook
is sli a valid alternative to a single
more powerful GPU we'll be looking at
the x7 from a few angles including raw
performance power consumption and the
thermals where the benefit of spreading
the heat out across multiple processors
in a thin form factor like this should
be pretty obvious one thing that i can
tell you guys already is that compared
to the g7 50 jz it's definitely louder
but we expected that so without further
ado take it away luke sli vs single GPU
notebook battle royale I'll start things
off with power consumption I was kind of
surprised to see only about a 5 percent
difference between these two laptops due
to dual GPUs and completely different
form factors and all that kind of stuff
one thing to remember is that your power
consumption is going to be a lot more
important on a laptop because you're
more often going to be gaming mobile and
that power is going be coming from the
battery instead of the wall in terms of
temperatures the x7 fell behind a little
bit it was a lot hotter than our Asus JZ
that we had part of that's going to play
in because it's much smaller form factor
they don't have as much space for things
like heat sinks and giant fans but it
does matter because it's going to
predict the lifespan of your components
inside of your laptop and really high
temperatures are going to cause sweaty
hands syndrome that annoying thing where
your hands get really gross when you're
gaming on a laptop for too long because
it is very hot in terms of noise we see
the x7 fall behind again but this is
again due to its form factor with the JZ
the big thick mass of JZ you are able to
pack in big thick larger fans which are
going to produce lower noise levels less
annoying noise and they're going to be
better at dissipating heat with the
small nice slimline x7 you're not able
to pack that huge fan in there and that
will make it not as effective at
dissipating heat louder and have a
little bit more annoying noise with high
pitches and last but not least we get to
performance the unfortunate thing that
happened with watchdogs is the SLI
profile didn't exactly take properly
this is a very new game and this is a
problem you're going to have when you're
running SLI level systems things aren't
going to be properly optimized profiles
won't properly work so when I was
playing watchdogs only one of the GPUs
was able to go through so when I was
running with the same settings on the
Jay Z and the x7 the X haven't got
crushed because only one of the GPUs
worked that being said in the future
once the profile starts working it'll be
fine it'll run much better like you see
in Far Cry 3 and BioShock Infinite it
ran completely fine and even one in Far
Cry 3 by a very small margin in
conclusion it comes down to what you're
looking for if you're looking for a
slimline gaming laptop the x7 is
probably not a bad idea because it is
very slimline the form factor is very
nice but then you have to deal with
things like higher thermals and kind of
annoying fan noise but you don't have to
do with more power because it's 5
percent less power but then you do have
to deal with SLI problems which may or
may not be fixed in a timely manner for
you to play the games that you want to
play so there's a bunch of different
variables that are up in the air it's
totally up to you and these laptops are
very different when it comes down to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
