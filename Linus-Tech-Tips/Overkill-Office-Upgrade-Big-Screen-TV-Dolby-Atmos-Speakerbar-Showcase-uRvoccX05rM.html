Luke only appears in our video is in
cameos now that was it no that's all the
Luke you get to okay gotta come over
here and nick has gotten a promotion
from junior assistant to line a
Sebastian to senior assistant to line a
Sebastian want a card that says that
where the hell are you in my office so
he also got an office as part of his new
CEO title but other than being money
green which was by special request from
Nick light this place like kind of sucks
so we're gonna be giving it the
executive treatment not lines blinds are
expensive tech hardware tech hardware
that we already had lying around you're
getting a TV oh that's actually pretty
cool yeah what would you think I was
coming in here for I don't know I
thought you're just gonna come in here
crap all over how bad my office wasn't
leave that was a possibility
step number one I don't think anyone's
convinced we do hard work here well
we're putting a TV in here with a Dolby
sound bar because it's video sponsored
by Dolby and they wanted us to
experience firsthand how much better a
sound bar is with Dolby Atmos then your
built-in TV speakers oh so you didn't
like just wake up today and go like I
want to do a nice thing for like my best
employee no well let's get rid of this
because I don't use paper anymore really
hashtag 2017 cabinet yeah at what point
do you cross the line between taking a
couple of extra napkins and stealing
from Chipotle what the hell
how much Tripoli to eat we should move
the desk over here yeah and then instead
of these like chairs like why don't you
just buy me a couch a couch yeah coach
you know what this couch is actually
really low I think we might be okay with
the TV height tell me where your planet
did you Jack a couple of are these
hoodies okay I knew you were gonna bring
that up I literally have them sir
because at some point someone was
visiting the office and they wanted
merch blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
number you know my mother just numbers
numbers numbers numbers not higher you
know I think that the commenters are
right you're out of ideas
I think the commenters are right you
know what you're the worst therapist of
all time I think I disassembled this
wrong I think you're supposed to like oh
there it is you drop the remote oh hey
ha this is me hoping look at me moving
the styrofoam this is the what HTS to
5000 and the big stick here is supposed
to be high res audio and then high res
Ida yeah high res audio
it's got HDR support and
Dolby 7.1.2 so seven is that it's
supposed to let you hear positionally
where sound is coming from around you
and then with that most you're supposed
to even be able to tell if something's
coming from like on top of you and then
the whole thing runs off the sound bar I
have to confess I have never used the
sound bar before I was one of those
hopeless people who actually well I
shouldn't say bought speaker stands but
I made speaker stands out of like a
threaded rod and well my dad helped me
with this so that's what was made out of
a threaded rod with like like a like a
wheelbarrow tire at the bottom and then
just like a nut on either side to hold
it still and then I literally zap
strapped satellite speakers behind me
for my gaming setup like back when I was
in high school okay in my defense I
don't think they had speaker bars then
yeah you are old now we can have the TV
and the Atmos speaker growing up our
squid or we could just have them both
plugging into a wall outlet like normal
people
yeah well because there's two things you
got me we need the power squid haha
there's a plug for the sock wah-wah and
there's a plug for the sound bar see I
new setups pretty simple just a Toslink
cable from the sound bar to the TV for
if you're running like the native
Netflix app on the TV then we go HDMI
into the sound bar from whatever sources
and then HDMI out from the sound bar to
the TV so really suck and you should be
able to fire it up with your computer as
a source I have that up first
this looks awesome like just this whole
set up here pretty darn sweet have to
admit I was like being a dick at first
because I thought you were just gonna be
like here's your cool setup and now it's
getting taken away but like if I
actually get to keep this as a dope okay
oh please wait okay
following the instructions thank you hey
you just the message that works I did
yeah what the heck how did this unlock
are you ready to experience Dolby Atmos
for the first time let's do it
do we want to shut the door or not sure
let's just bother people who cares let's
do the helicopter helicopter takeoff is
not a plane
yeah 747 is a plane not a helicopter
thank you
that is a lot more convincing than I was
expecting pretty trippy actually did you
close your eyes
no okay try try it with your eyes closed
it's it's it's pretty trippy
katas there's very much an overhead
nature to the sound
not that into the movie sound good it's
very obvious who is where far more
directional than I would have expected
looking at the looking at the bar and
there's tons of content
I mean 4k blu-rays both Netflix and Vudu
have started to stream their latest
movies and TV shows NAT Mouse so I mean
I guess honestly that that pretty much
wraps up the video the whole idea here
was for I mean me really but Nick got to
come along for the ride
was for for us to experience Dolby Atmos
for the first time with not an overkill
you know multi-thousand dollar set up so
this sound bar by the time you're
spending a few grand on a TV for another
1,500 for this particular model is not
completely outlandish and I was really
really surprised at the directionality
of the sound especially in the overhead
experience this particular sound bar is
the sony HT st 5000 but there are a ton
of dolby atmos equipped sound bars from
other names like Samsung LG Yamaha
pretty much you name it and they're
available at a ton of different price
points so you can learn more about
pricing and availability at the link in
the video description and a huge shout
out to Dolby for sponsoring this video
and a thank you to you guys for watching
I hope it was entertaining yeah we don't
let Nick come on camera for that reason
most of the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
