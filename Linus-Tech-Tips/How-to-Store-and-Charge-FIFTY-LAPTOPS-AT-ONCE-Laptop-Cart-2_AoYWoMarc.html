long journey oh hold on I think that's
in the way it actually started that's
back in February 2017 which come to
think of it like why did it take so long
for us to get a laptop charging cart so
that we can keep our laptop batteries
from getting damaged well you can't just
send me emails in the middle of the
night and expect me to conjure a laptop
card out of midair oh right speaking of
conjuring things out of midair
thanks to be quiet for conjuring this
sponsor spot there wait dark-faced Pro
900 features a modular design to support
a variety of different layouts and
configurations oh look at the link in
the video description to learn more
so in all seriousness though what did
take so long well we had this vision of
what we wanted but every commercial
laptop cart that we could find either
held too few laptops or it was limited
to 17-inch devices which clearly wasn't
gonna cut it for some of the laptops
that we need to store so I'm sure by now
you guys have figured out where I'm
going with this
maybe thanks to the huge proto K
shipment that we're we just well
actually we're getting ready to drag it
outside for an outdoor unboxing but for
the kings of overkill
there was just no reasonable choice
other than going with a fully custom
solution from our BFFs over at proto
case but Linus just build it out of wood
Linus come on Linus no that's stupid if
the note seven taught us anything it's
that batteries sometimes very often but
sometimes blow up so covering the
kindling in a gigantic flammable box
isn't really the best idea we want to
stick with metal so after some
brainstorming with Jake we refined our
original concept and sent a package over
to the design team at proto case
apparently you can literally send them
cellphone photos of napkin scribbles and
they'll turn it into something coherent
so that makes me feel a little better
about the combination of technical CAD
drawings and I see you not mspaint
concept drawings that we put together
huge shout out especially to Darrel over
there for all of his help
turning our designs into something
actually usable especially since our
original concept would have weighed over
700 pounds he made tons of great
suggestions and dealt with the countless
revisions and changes that Jake and I
made without any complaining at least
not to us now I'm not gonna lie this
project didn't get done in the
guaranteed two to three day production
time of a typical protocol
the design work
ellone took up 42 man-hours almost five
and a half working days and the
fabrication of something this complex
took a pretty significant chunk of time
as well 46 individual pieces had to be
cut with an industrial laser save for
the right side panel which actually
needed the CNC router treatment thanks
to its 1223 cutouts the laser is
actually so powerful it would just warp
the crap out of something with that many
intricate cuts then the cutters tend to
leave some sharp edges and little
shavings known as burrs so each part got
a quick run through the de buri machines
with large stiff bristles that polish
the edges down a bit bringing us then to
the glue of this build fasteners we did
end up with a few welded joints but we
tried to keep everything as deep
constructible as possible so in total
almost 260 individual fasteners were
manually pressed into the sheets of
metal these little guys are essentially
threaded metal that screws can be well
screwed into before moving into a
cosmetics like powder coat the pieces
were individually cleaned in gigantic
vats of degreaser then dried in an oven
because ain't nobody got time to wait
for air drying then the real magic
happens in the paint station where the
powder coating gun is charged to one
hundred thousand volt making the powder
coat nice and electrically sticky for
the metal pieces well let's uh why don't
we you ready huh you ready oh I'm ready
let's do this thing
okay ready oh my god we got a court
napier ritzy alright let's do this
you think we're gonna take this whole
thing apart with that little knife yeah
okay I'm gonna get a bigger you know
what I'm gonna have it done by the time
you get back at Seoul there's no night
so I have scissors scissors really these
are titanium coated okay man this thing
weighs like 400 pounds 400 and some
change 400 and change but that's down
from 700 see it's not about the actual
weight it's about the improvement right
this is incredible here we can see the
custom full-frontal silkscreen job
designed by Ed Yago himself this was no
easy feat 20 separate screens were used
for the design each requiring a tedious
prep process involving burning the
layouts into the screen and cleaning the
burnt portions with a pressure washer
and then that's all before you even
think about applying the ink so this
400-pound beast got assembled and skin
shipped across the continent to our
office in Vancouver and it's time for us
to charge some fricking laptops yeah
okay yeah over on this side you can see
there's six fans over here giving us air
flow across the AC to DC Chargers as
well as like you know if you have a
razor blade for example and it just
decides to like cook randomly wake up
when it's supposed to be sleeping then
this will keep it from boiling itself so
should we grab everything else oh yeah
we should take the stuff out first okay
there's a lip on that one man this thing
is solid
yeah the doors are steel so they're like
is this fan controllers like how do we
power it and I was like
NZXT oh you're just gonna okay well it's
not that heavy anymore without all that
roars inside it Oh hold on I'm slipping
kind of a big deal
Oh God did you lock this wheel dang it
cheap why would you lock the wheel I was
happy about how it locks okay okay slow
down okay there's another cart there
how's my parking job here how are we
supposed to actually plug things into
this top PDU oh cool that's a minor
design oversight Jake here just so you
guys can see what I'm talking about so
these are intended to hold the AC
adapters captive thumb screws exosome
see yeah that was the idea and they're
vented and they're aluminum and light we
can customize it how we want so let's
see if you can do this okay that's not
very fun but yes it it can technically
be done well just a power adapter it's
fine oh wait well here do you want to
pop the top and then rain drops drop top
I got this you'd be fine
okay maybe I don't it's custom Brandon
guy so I don't mean I realize this is a
supremely first-world problem but like
we have a lot of laptops and right now
they're all just sitting on the shelf
essentially rotting because I don't know
if you know this but if this charge is
over time and then it can actually go
bad if it sits there discharged or too
long remember kids if you got too much
discharge it's always a bad thing that
would have been not that bad until you
prefaced it with remember kids
how is this thing
Dora oh my god math questions does this
have like an ExpressCard why are we even
bothering to keep this thing alive
I hate these stock cable ties they're
trash it's just garbage so
this is the water-cooled laptop the
laptop can go in the card and then we'll
just put the watercooler like next to it
okay no okay yeah okay just just give it
to me
devices like this we should really
charge and stuff what is that they're
cool
yeah when are you ever gonna use this
well never which is exactly why we need
to be charging it so it doesn't die it's
basically just a smartphone with a fat
keyboard yeah yeah wow that is something
honestly like half the laptops on the
bottom I've only got one is this 5 6 7 8
laptops down here I've got like 12 power
bricks
I can barely even put like so it takes
up like this much space up here proto
case we're gonna need a rev - Rev - I
actually don't know how many laptops we
have so I'm about to find out 1 &amp;amp; 2
Verde laptops plus when Joep up + people
who have laptops deployed to them I have
2 all the writers have one each we
probably have like 40 to 50 laptops why
well whatever the reason for it is we
finally have a safe place to store them
everything from the thin and lights on
the top to the sort of like gaming
models in the middle / you know powerful
models like the Mac Pros here MacBook
Pro rather to the completely
over-the-top ridiculous ones huge shout
out to proto case for sending this over
to us if you can imagine it proto case
can pretty much build it how heavy is
this thing now like this is it this is a
hard rubber tire ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
satisfaction when you call them you
speak to a real person not an automated
phone tree and you only pay for what you
use with the average ting bill under $25
per month per device you don't have to
kind of guess if it'll work for you
though you can go over to linus ENCOM
we'll have that link below and use their
savings calculator enter your last few
bills and how much you paid for them and
it'll spit out whether you'd save money
on ting then when you decide to switch
to ting all you got to do is go to that
link and you can get 25 bucks towards a
service credit what's cool is that on
top of that if you need to get out of
your contract to switch to ting ting
will cover 25% of your cancellation fee
up to $75 so again head over to lino
stay calm and check them out so thanks
for watching guys if you like this video
you can hit the like button if you just
liked it
you can hit
that button too but otherwise get
subscribed check out our merch store
check out proto case these guys are
flippin awesome we love working with
them
especially because they send us such
cool stuff what else are they talking
about we have a merged store we'll have
that linked in the video description
also our community forum now it's locked
now people cannot get any laptops ever
again if we lose this key so let's try
not to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
