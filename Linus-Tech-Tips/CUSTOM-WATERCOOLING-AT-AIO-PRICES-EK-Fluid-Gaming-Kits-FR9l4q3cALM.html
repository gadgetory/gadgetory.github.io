mine for the last decade or so so you
might wonder then why it is that we
hardly ever cover it on the channel
anymore and the truth is that low-cost
AIO liquid coolers are more or less the
same to within a degree or two and as
for custom water cooling well it's
expensive making it niche and play
frankly there's not a lot of improvement
left to make so again we're talking a
degree or two if you're lucky it's
mostly compatibility updates on both
sides but that is where everything
changes today ek is new line of custom
water cooling parts promises the low
cost of a iOS with the future upgrade
ability not to mention nearly all the
performance of custom water cooling but
can it hold up to all these claims let's
find out
LTX for first meetup we've done in over
two years go check it out only like 800
tickets remaining
I've said for a while that water cooling
is more about fashion than practicality
these days and the funny thing about
fashion is that it's a cyclical and
decays fluid gaming kits are no
exception here their revolutionary
feature the fact that they're made
exclusively out of aluminum was first
popularized by coolant over 10 years ago
now the advantages of aluminum are
several it's incredibly light it's fast
and easy to machine and perhaps most
importantly it's much less expensive
than copper so why did coolants
eventually abandon aluminum for copper
great question and we'll get into that a
bit later first let's take a look at the
Freak it that ek is selling today each
one of them includes an all new aluminum
CPU block called the supremacy ax a PWM
controlled pump with an integrated tube
reservoir already a big advantage over
basical and ones that don't include an
easy way to top them up some basic
tubing ek is well-regarded Vardar fans
and DK's new aluminum compression
fittings that they designed specifically
for these kids where the kits differ
from each other is in the radiator
configurations and the inclusion or
absence of a universal Pascal GPU block
but again we'll touch a bit more on that
later assembly was easier than you'd
probably think yeah it's more time
consuming than installing an a io but it
also shouldn't take longer than about an
hour for the non GPU kits plus 30 to 45
minutes for each video card you add and
during the process we found both things
we appreciated compression fittings are
so much nicer than janky integrated
Barb's that make the components hard to
reuse and things that we didn't this
tubing was a definite cost-saving
measure which aside from acquiring us to
lube it up with warm water and push a
little harder than we
like also required us to carefully plan
our loop to avoid any excess kinkiness
on the subjective planning
if you spring for the a to 40 G be sure
to check the fine print it's block is
universal as long as you're running a
GTX 1060 or up and you also happen to
have a Founders Edition version of your
card so AMD users and last generation
Nvidia users need not apply but we can
live with all the compromises if fluid
gaming lives up to e K's promises so for
our test we used eks new kits popular a
iOS from Corsair and custom copper
components from ek zone lineup on one of
our Asus x99 test benches with a core i7
59 60 X and NVIDIA Titan XP then to
eliminate variables to the greatest
degree possible we use ek Vardar fans
running at max speed and a thousand rpm
a setting that we determined to be a
good balance between performance and
noise in the fractal design define r5
and the results are mostly as expected
which is a good thing with the a 120 and
the copper 120 setup trading blows while
the h-60 legs slightly behind moving on
the a2 40 looks like a much more
compelling value than its little brother
for a very small price bump you get a
radiator that's twice the size and
another fan which considering its retail
value of 18 bucks means based on these
performance numbers you're getting a lot
more bang for your buck last up to the
plate is the a 240 G it's kind of like
the rich uncle of the a 240 like you've
actually not much better cooling wise
but at least he has a vote and by boat I
mean a GPU block here we got a little
creative with our comparative testing
putting it up against a similar copper
loop and a dual a i/o setup with an
Jetix T's kraken g12 obviously that
isn't an ideal setup aesthetically but
it was the previous value full system
water cooling king and you can clearly
see that that is no longer the case
so then eks claims of better upgrade
ability and better performance compared
to a iOS seem to check out so what's the
drawback well that brings us to why
coolant discontinued their aluminum
products if you mix these with copper
products in the same loop it's possible
may likely that you will experience
what's known in the biz as a really bad
time or galvanic corrosion it can be so
bad and I don't personally trust any
anti corrosive additive that claims that
it prevents it but your block can be
eaten away to the point where it can
actually spring a leak so ek is taking a
big risk here a risk that some user will
combine their value aluminum line up
with their premium copper line up and
possibly get gunk in their blocks or at
worst Bork his or her system but seeing
the performance and the price I don't
blame them for trying and I have to give
them credit for tackling this as safely
as I think they could they're launching
these parts exclusively in kits for now
rather than individually and there are
warning labels everywhere so bottom line
then if you want to invest in custom
water cooling that you can reuse and
upgrade down the line but you want to
save a few bucks we really like this
product as a whole especially the a 240
and the a 240 G FreshBooks
helps small business owners and
freelancers get more organized more
productive and I mean cash flows
everything when you're running a small
business get paid more quickly you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in seconds you can set up
online payment
with just a couple clicks to get paid up
to four days faster you can see when a
client a senior invoice putting an end
to the guessing games and perhaps most
importantly it's all cloud-based so you
can take the entire functionality of
FreshBooks with you on the go on your
mobile device
so there's no excuse anymore for working
hard all day and then having to go home
at the end of the day and try remember
horrible expenses how many hours did I
