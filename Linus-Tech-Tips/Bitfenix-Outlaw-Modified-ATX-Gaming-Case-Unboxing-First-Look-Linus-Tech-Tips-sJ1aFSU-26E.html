outlaw which is a pretty unique case now
it has an inverted motherboard trait
that's not unique but what is unique is
an inverted motherboard tray at this
kind of a price point so we'll see what
BitFenix has to say for themselves and
then we'll we'll figure out what I think
is important so unique thermal layout
okay I think what they mean to say is
inverted motherboard tray CPU cooler
cutout which is now at the bottom of the
motherboard tray that's like voodoo
magic right 4 USB 2.0 ports this is a
value oriented case so we're still
looking at USB 2 side panel cooling ok
good full black interior also very good
because we will be able to see inside
through the side panel cooling hits long
VGA cards which is pretty much a must
for a gaming case these days but still
gets neglected from time to time by some
manufacturers whose products are not as
well thought out as the ones who are
thinking it out well enough to include
compatibility for long VGA cards and you
can probably tell by this time that I'm
just killing time while I break the
seals on the box there we are first
thing we find inside is a quick
installation guide now this this package
went through hell and back to reach me
you can clearly see that the packing
materials are broken but what we're
gonna find out because remember broken
packet and packing materials is fine
broken case bad so we're gonna find out
if the broken packing materials were
able to absorb enough impact to protect
the case inside so here is the quick
installation guide which tells you how
to what is lock loop electroplated The
Kinks logo sticker cool cool remove
screws basic installation find the four
inch drives I think that pictures
harmony when I first got into computers
the manual for a case was text like I
kid you not
they didn't even document things like
like front panel headers at all and back
then there weren't standards for things
like front panel audio so you just had
to kind of guess based on well the
motherboards one
says VCC something and then that case
one says VDD and one of them they're
both kind of plus and so maybe they're
maybe they're related in some way ok so
this came up here's the packing
materials ok this was shipped to me as a
single unit though it didn't come on a
pallet and I don't know where it came
from actually I can find out where it
came from just to give you guys some
idea so alright yeah so it came from
across the continent actually let's take
off the plastic and find out what kind
of shape it arrived in I see a Fender on
it alright Oh looks good for now that's
good for now looks good for now
alright look at that hey they made it ok
so let's have a look at the Elwha then
excellent ah so yeah let's do outside
impressions first so we've got dual 120
millimeter fans on the top I would have
preferred to see these closer together
so you can use a dual 100 millimeter or
dual 120 mil radiator in the top without
any modification however it's possible
that because this is a value case the
inside isn't big enough to do it anyway
so we'll have to have a look you'll
notice that on the side panel we were
where we would normally find like
cooling or a window there's nothing
that's because this is the wrong side
panel for that in this case due to the
inverted motherboard tray on the front
we find their soft touch finish which
honestly as soon as we started demoing
these in these stores at NCIX where I
work customers started buying them far
more because they really liked the soft
touch finish so they have that on their
Colossus they have that on a number of
their cases it is significantly more
expensive than just a powder-coated
black finish but especially for the
front does 'el looks really really sharp
and I really like it so on the front top
we've got four USB 2.0 ports a
microphone
a headphone port power LED harddrive LED
power switch and little tiny reset
switch good to see because that way
you're not going to accidentally hit it
we've got mesh on the sides here as well
as on the front here the front here and
the sides on the other side so that is
going to enable us to provide these two
120 millimeter fans with the airflow
that they need to cool the rest of your
system we've also got four or five and a
quarter inch bays and here's something I
haven't seen before so it looks like if
you install for five and a quarter inch
devices you will be blocking that top
120 millimeter fan honestly with this
case having the cooling options that it
does already have I wouldn't worry hold
on I think I might've might have screwed
up here a second and okay maybe I just
have to hit it harder okay so we've got
the fans here we've got fans on the top
I wouldn't worry too much about your
stuff not getting enough cooling so
thumb screws at the back that screws
here and here bottom mounted power
supply actually it's more like a top
mounted power supply because check this
out I take the whole case and I go like
this now it just looks like a standard
case with the top mounted power supply
your eye of shield your 120ml cooling
fan and your PCI slots right whoops but
that would be upside down for this case
but I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna remove
the side panels now I'm breaking
everything sort of one thing after
another for this unboxing hasn't it
all right let's flip it back over and
you are going to find a very strange
internal layout so the cooling summary
is dual 120 s in the front 120 in the
bottom dual 120 s at the top 120 at the
back and dual 120 s or 240 s on this
side panel which sits like this and will
blow down on your graphics
area as well as your CPU area or rather
sorry your graphics card area as well as
your CPU area because they are
upside-down in this case ok accessories
here we have your power supply which has
little rubber pieces to allow you to
even if you have a long power supply
look at that they go all the way out to
here it's going to support it you're
going to be able to mount it with the
fan down so you won't have any you know
loose screws falling into your power
supply because some cases have room for
power supplies on the bottom but they
don't have ventilation here so what can
happen is unless you mount the power
supply with the fan facing the top that
won't get any air so you can
accidentally drop things in it I dropped
water in one once that was bad so it
didn't work anyway
fortunately it didn't kill any of my
other stuff when it died so I I was
fortunate I was fortunate that way I
don't remember what power supply it was
I killed though ok I don't like this is
throwing me off a lot I'm gonna be like
honest with you guys here it's thing
really confusing looking at this because
I'm like oh I'm hoping the case is
upside down but I'm not okay so 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 PCI slots you've got water cooling
grommets here so that's at the top of
the case here you're going to you've got
a couple pre-installed motherboard stand
off but you'll have to fill in the rest
of them on your own your CPU a trade cut
out is not huge but the reality of it is
it doesn't have to be huge in a lot of
cases because you can even if you're
even if your CPU socket is here you can
slip it in from the back and then
position it and then screw on whatever
it is from the front so it's not that
big of a deal as long as it's big enough
to fit the backplate through and then
you can reposition as needed up on the
top here it looks like due to the up on
the top at the bottom here
nevermind nothing up at the top it looks
like yes we will not be able to fit a
dual 120 millimeter radiator just due to
the clearance that would be interfered
with by this by a bottom installed PCI
card so that's probably why they didn't
bother with that spacing 5 and our three
and a half inch bays we've got one two
three
for three and a half inch hard drive
bays and then down here at the bottom
we've also I think that is the bladder
okay we've also got a two and a half
inch two and a half inch cut out so that
you can put an SSD down to the bottom of
your case one two three four five and a
quarter inch bays I think we already
talked about that and black internal
cables love to see black internal cables
there's your front panel switches and
LEDs and whatnots
here's your front panel audio your front
panel USB 2 and then your other more
different front panel USB 2 so thank you
for checking out my very confused
unboxing of the BitFenix outlaw I think
what is outlawed about it is that it
just sort of breaks every rule for a
value case it's got a nice finish on the
bezel which is really good to see lots
of cooling options tons of cooling
options it's like a cooling box and then
in theory it also provides better
cooling due to the inverted ATX layout
which allows you to blow away all your
CPU heat here and then heat rises so
having your video cards especially if
you're running two or more up at the top
where you can exhaust the heat right
away could in theory be a good thing as
well and you've also do to the layout of
the case got ventilation almost all the
way up to the top if you only have one
five and a quarter inch device because
this is all mesh and then you've got
mesh on the side here as well so you can
exhaust that way if you have cards that
blow not only out the back of the case
but also out the front of the card so
thank you for checking out this unboxing
don't forget to subscribe to learn his
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos sorry guys I
forgot
inside the accessory box there are some
zip ties there are also about 300
billion thumb screws yeah like seriously
like how many thumb screws could one
person need the answer is this many and
then finally some other more different
screws power supply screws motherboard
standoffs motherboard screws and last
but not least a very stylish looking
shiny metal from metal metal metal
BitFenix logo and that is all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
