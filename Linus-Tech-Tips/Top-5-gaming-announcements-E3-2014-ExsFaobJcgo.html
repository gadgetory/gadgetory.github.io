brought to you by hyperx fury series

alright guys III is wrapping up I wanted
to cover our kind of top five in no
particular order announcements of what
happened at e3 honestly the top
announcement for me was GTA 5 now this
is in terms of gaming GTA 5 is a really
interesting it's I'm surprised it's
about a year after the original release
of the game I don't know why they needed
this much time although I hope it was
performance optimization no GTA 4 did
not run very well when it was first
released another thing is i hope that
ice enhance or IC enhance i'm not
entirely sure how to pronounce that
makes another mod for GTA 5 and hope GTA
5 is heavily model GTA 4 looked amazing
with this mod and i really hope it comes
to GTA 5 next up is the zelda
announcement absolutely amazing i could
fill this entire video with just
nintendo announcements but i'm not going
to it's an open-world zelda game honing
back to the origins of the legend of
zelda being able to just explore and
travel around and experience the world
summit Zelda games we've seen are fairly
linear and even wind waker HD or just
winwaker is it's a lot of water and then
a lot of islands where there's one entry
in one exit point not a ton of
exploration that's something they're
going to change for legend of zelda i
highly recommend you check out the
official Nintendo video just to see how
beautiful this game looks Nintendo Wii U
is not necessarily the strongest
platform but they're optimizing the art
style of these games to run very well on
it and it's very interesting too soon
next was dead rising 3 coming to PC
which I was super excited about until I
realized that they were frame capping it
at 30fps what are you guys doing there's
an ability to take that frame cap off
but they're straight up like yeah that
you're going to even have problems it's
going to break the game what how is this
possibly still an issue I can't believe
we're having these problems if you're if
you think that's okay i would highly
recommend checking out Linus is tech
quickie video on refresh rates just so
you can realize how kind of crap that
actually is next is rise of the Tomb
Raider actually really liked the new
tomb raider game i really like the art
style and I really liked how they made
the character actually have emotions and
not just boobs it's actually pretty
interesting and this game is going to be
set all across the world and the
going to home back to the original games
where you're actually going to be having
a focus on exploration of tombs this
time I know the most recent tomb raider
there was a little bit of it but that
wasn't the focus of the game so I'm
really excited to see this game continue
forward and last we have halo master
chief edition this is on the Xbox I know
but I was a huge fan of halo 1 and 2 so
I had to cover this one there
remastering all the old games well I'll
all as in 1 2 3 and 4 and they're going
to be releasing them all on one disk
it'll be 1080p 60fps and it does
actually look pretty good if you check
them out online somewhere it's it's
going to be interesting because they're
keeping all the old mechanics as for
instance in halo 1 the pistol will be
super super overpowered that's great i'm
excited to go play blood gulch and cat
people in the head with a normal pistol
and you'll be able to matchmake randomly
for any of the games so you be able to
match make random and get cute for halo
1 2 3 and 4 maps all the same time
actually think that's fairly interesting
still don't know if it's going to be
enough to get me to get an Xbox probably
not but either way it's pretty cool
announcement thanks for watching our e3
coverage if you want to see all the rest
