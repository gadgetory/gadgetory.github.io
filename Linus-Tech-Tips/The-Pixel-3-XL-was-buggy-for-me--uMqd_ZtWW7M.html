Excel were excellent the above-average
haptics really make it stand out among
other Android devices then things
immediately took a turn for the worse
when I missed a handful of critical
Google Hangouts messages a fresh format
without using the transfer cable did get
that resolved and so I spent my last
couple of weeks
mostly enjoying my time with Google's
latest and greatest flagship that is
until today when I ran into a new
deal-breaker software bug which is not
being able to login to my gmail account
no matter how many times I enter the
password and the authentication code so
I guess we'll just get the review done
so I can switch back to my other phone
whether you're migrating 500 computers
to Windows 10 managing remote devices or
repairing a single PC smartdeploy has
flexible deployment options so head over
to smartdeploy dot-com slash Linus for a
special offer
the most obvious change to Google's
stock Android experience is the on
screen navigation buttons and they're
kind of the worst of both worlds
unlike Apple's gestures they take up
valuable screen real estate along the
bottom of the phone and unlike other
Android software buttons they are not
reconfigurable with the back button
stuck way over on the left out of sheer
pigheadedness as far as I can tell they
have their strengths as long as you
don't need to go too far back into your
recents the slide is super fast and
intuitive and if you don't like that
feature you can slide up once for a more
traditional reasons and some suggested
apps it's really cool that this works
from anywhere now not just the home
screen but there's room for improvement
here too as it is it requires a second
swipe to reach the app tray how about
just one really hard swipe and then it
could carry through with momentum I
would like that a lot
the other big change that bothered me
more than I expected is the inability to
execute Google assistant functions that
used to work while the phone was locked
like bringing up your shopping list or
reminders things you can only do now if
you have Google's special pixel stand
wireless charging I get that there are
privacy concerns around voice print
authentication especially for people
like me
but this limitation negated a lot of the
usefulness of squeezing to bring up the
Google assistant I mean if I have to
shift my grip on the phone to touch the
rear fingerprint sensor anyway then why
wouldn't I just do that in the first
place
I used the squeeze a fair bit on the
pixel to excel and then on this one I
basically just used it as a flashlight
toggle and here come the rest of my
gripes about Google assistant I ran into
this bizarre bug a handful of times with
it not registering my internet
connection when I clearly had one Google
continues to advertise natural
interaction with the assistants as a
selling point when my experience is
still that you basically have to read
the correct syntax manual to get
anything useful done it still somehow
doesn't convert my to you when it
creates tasks and the handling of
reminder notifications is awful
if you have more than
one set up your phone just buzzes and
the car doesn't move to the top or
breakout the most recent one or do
anything useful to draw your attention
and it's pretty easy to have more than
one when you're a complete scatterbrain
like me and sometimes I'll even have
recurring ones like taking out the
garbage cluttering up the list
now it's mostly fine as a voice
dictation program my issue here is the
branding if I had a real-life assistant
and they were this inconsistent they
would be fired it is not a time-saver if
I have to issue the command twice and
then look at my screen to double-check
that my reminder actually says something
coherent what was it I guess I'll never
know so I guess it just baffles me that
Google is building AI robots to make
calls for me and reschedule my
appointments when they still can't
figure out the basics I asked my
assistant to remind me to do something
tomorrow when I get to work and it set a
reminder for 8:00 a.m. the next day well
before I even arrived at work without
prompting me if I want to make any
changes now that behavior has been fixed
that was right at the beginning when I
got it but it still doesn't work the way
I'd expect it asks me what time then
when I say when I get to work ya dunce
it navigates me there but that so you've
probably noticed by this point that I
haven't talked much about the hardware
that's for good reason
aside from the pixel three being very
compact for a 20-18 flagship neither it
nor it's excel sized cousin really tries
to differentiate based on the hardware
there are a couple of standout features
like ip68 water resistance a hundred
percent dcpip three color space coverage
and stereo front-facing speakers but
there's no microSD slot no fullscreen
notch list design no massive battery no
headphone jack no weird holographic
display or stylus that doubles as a
remote control or ten gigs of RAM option
or whatever and that's okay it just
means that the software experience needs
to be amazing not fine I guess
why is oneplus as overall system
responsiveness better than google's own
why are Google's software engineers busy
keeping track of Health and Wellness
screen time crap instead of building
core functionality like screen recording
why now that facial unlocking has been
removed is there no way to unlock this
device without either picking it up off
my wireless charger or poking a pin code
into it like some kind of cavemen and
how is it that Google's own apps look
ridiculous with like cutoff text with
their gargantuan knotch and that's even
ignoring the stuff that they seem to be
consciously screwing up display profiles
have stupid names like adaptive boosted
and natural instead of just listing the
white point in color space and the audio
controls are significantly worse than
Oreo so there's this clever little
gesture where you can press your volume
up and your lock button in order to mute
your phone but then there's no toggle
functionality when you hit it again
also whose genius idea I would genuinely
like to talk to this person was it to
change the default volume rocker
behavior to media instead of ringtone
volume when you're not doing anything
and finally this is by far my favorite
one
they've bundled up one of my favorite
features the ability to quickly adjust
any volume slider without stopping what
you're doing and opening the Settings
app like you're on a freakin iPhone why
also I know I mentioned this already but
we're really getting to the point where
it's not funny or endearing anymore that
Google by default doesn't allow you to
move the back button to the right side
like this is getting ridiculous you
don't even have another button there
anymore now for all I know this next one
is last passes problem not googles but
LastPass integration has gotten
continually worse on Android over the
last couple of years with the most
irritating issue for me being that it
used to work when you were signing into
Google accounts and now it doesn't
Google now has their own service for
this coincidence perhaps
or maybe they're pushing competitors out
either way shockingly Apple finally
allows third-party password managers
with face ID now apple's implementation
isn't perfect but it is so much better i
don't want to use first party utilities
for this kind of functionality i want
something that works on my android phone
on my iphone and on my desktop for that
matter and before we get into good stuff
i'm gonna close this segment out with
one petty gripe i hate that it's an
extra click from the notification
pulldown now to access my settings i
haven't had to have a settings icon on
my home screen on android for a long
time but i guess that's just still more
iPhone crap that we get to go back to
now maybe I'm just a freak but I don't
like desktop clutter everywhere
and I access the settings menu a fair
bit that last thing though is more than
offset by my first good feature actually
this is awesome the ability to review
and delete voicemails without dialing
into your voicemail I hate voicemail I
actually plan to turn mine off at some
point but I just haven't gotten around
to it because it's managed through the
company and blah blah blah so on my
other phones I always have this stupid
notification that can't be dismissed
this is much better
I also absolutely love that I can
interact with notifications on the
always-on display that was a great
feature on the Droid turbo and one that
I've been missing ever since I got rid
of that phone so a text message comes in
and I can just marques read without ever
waking the screen it's absolutely
beautiful
now Google just needs to wake up to the
need for Marquez red on everything only
then can I achieve true notification
bliss also for lawless I kept Google's G
board instead of immediately installing
Swift key like I normally do and with
some fine-tuning
what's really good I had no idea that
you can slide across the space bar to
reposition the cursor that is awesome
but as someone who uses voice dictation
a fair bit it was still a relief to go
back to Swift key so I usually find that
when dictation screws up a word it
usually ends up getting a couple wrong
because one mistake can change the
meaning of a whole sentence when you
click to fix an error in Swift key
you'll end up with suggest
that fix the rest of the sentence as
well and its really awesome I also
really liked the way that when you
switch to landscape mode the gesture
controls stay on the same edge as in
portrait mode this is a lot better than
the way that the home swipe up moves on
the iPhone to the bottom of the screen
requiring you to shift your hand in
order to access it making matters worse
for the iPhone is that some apps don't
auto hide that bar even while they're
playing full screen video and it's
probably not apples fall but the YouTube
creator studio is one such app and I use
it very regularly so it was super
annoying and yet another neat little
feature it's small but this one actually
made me really really happy when you
don't have your auto rotate on and you
go and open up a photo that was taken in
landscape mode
it actually prompts you to click a
little button and it'll switch to
landscape and this is really nice for
people like my wife who don't like auto
rotate but might want to show me a
picture without me absolutely losing my
mind over the waisted black space all
over the screen which I guess leads us
pretty well into the camera it's good
in fact it's great there are cases where
the iPhone 10's tools it but there are
other cases where the pixel threes
camera makes the iPhones look like it
was designed by the same folks who
calibrated all the TVs at your local
Best Buy I think calling this anything
but a toss-up is probably not being fair
to the strengths of either one at least
as far as the rear camera is concerned
but when it comes to the front camera
Google has done a fantastic job here and
I'm glad that someone is finally tired
of the entire industry sandbagging
front-facing cameras even if it does
cost us this hideous notch as for its
nearest Android competitor the note 9 it
is definitely showing its age a little
bit already so maybe we can follow this
up with a full round up once Samsung
releases their next generation for now
though I can say with confidence that as
long as you're ok with the slow initial
shutter response time that I got
sometimes look at that that you will be
very happy with the pixel 3 Excel I was
actually blown away by these videos that
I got of my kids on Halloween night like
there's a lot of noise in the image of
course but remember that this is with
horrendous street lamp lighting this
thing's got a great camera so pixel 3
then
on the one hand it's priced like other
flagship phones with only really the
camera to set it apart but on the other
hand it has the most overlooked feature
a built-in fidget spinner give yourself
the gift of listening and while you're
at it think about giving the gift of
audible to someone on your nice list
right now for a limited time you can get
three months of audible for six
ninety-five a month that's more than
half off the regular price so go to
audible.com slash Linus or text Linus to
500 500 that's so much audible originals
are exclusive audio titles created by
celebrated storytellers from worlds as
diverse as theater journalism literature
and more one title that stands out is
Twain's feast narrated by Nick Offerman
an eighth chapter journey through Mark
Twain's life and travels using his
favorite foods as our map so go to
audible.com slash Linus or text Linus to
five hundred five hundred to get audible
for six ninety-five a month for three
months don't worry you don't have to do
the tweens feast thing you can get it
like anything you want they have like
everything tweens feast so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if you liked it hit
