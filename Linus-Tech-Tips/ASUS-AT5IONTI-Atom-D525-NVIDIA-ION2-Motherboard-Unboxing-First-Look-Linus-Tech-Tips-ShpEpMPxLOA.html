from a soos this is the 85 IO n T - I
motherboard it features a few different
things one it is fanless - it is slim I
guess what they mean is ITX okay it has
USB 3.0 eSATA and it is amplifier
friendly interesting okay this is a mini
max so home entertainment center branded
motherboard let's go ahead and flip it
over and see what it's got to say for
itself
on the back so it features the Intel
Atom d5 25 dual-core processor as well
as next generation Nvidia ion chipset
and GPU it has a silent thermal solution
with fanless heat dissipation at 0
decibels ok I think that means silent
and thermal and solution solutions are
generally effective ok accelerates heat
transfer with a heat pipe design very
nice bigger area for heat dissipation
and completely silent so yes it's silent
got it home theater PC high-definition
experience of video and audio yes the
Nvidia ion next-generation chipset is
capable of accelerating hi-def decoding
so that means you can watch high-def
content on this tiny little fanless
motherboard here we've got a user's
guide along with some along with the DVD
with your drivers and utilities and all
that good stuff
powered by sue stickers so throw this
away except the sticker download the
latest off the Sue's website we've got
an i/o shield pretty much what we're
used to seeing and we have two SATA
cables both of which are straight SATA
cable if not right angles in our
environmental attack friendly packaging
we will find the motherboard next clip
at there ok that's actually pretty
nice-looking ok so the first thing we
notice about this is that it has an
enormous heat pipe cooler on it that not
only has fins for just heat dissipation
inside but it also has through the back
of the i/o shield so when you put this
on it actually also has some external
access
so I guess they're expecting you to get
a little bit of you know airflow through
there to get some additional cooling so
that's an interesting approach to take
to something like this okay there's our
Seuss logo and that he'd say it's
actually quite nice looking looks uh
looks very expensive in terms of cooling
solutions that I've seen on micro ATX
motherboards in the past I've got three
heat pipes going on there all right
let's take a look at the layout of the
rest of this board so we've got a few
fan headers that's kind of nice to see
as well that's a lot of fan headers for
a micro ATX board we've got three not
including CPU fan although I don't see
anywhere to mount a CPU a fan you could
always just kind of bolt one on after
the fact there is no four pin CPU power
connector so this is powered entirely by
the 24 pin connector
we've got two sodium memory slots so
those are four I actually don't know is
that gonna be ddr2 or ddr3 those are
gonna be ddr3 sodium memory slots okay
so we've got little clips here don't
need those looks like there's an extra
power port that you could they could
potentially solder on here if they need
it here's a clear CMOS switch
here's our BIOS chip we've got two SATA
ports so those are SATA 2 ports then
we've got a PCI Express 4x slot okay but
that's an open slot so what you could
potentially do I mean if you have really
wanted to is you could take a full 16 X
card and install it in there so I'll
show you guys what I mean by an open
slot so go ahead and put that on the
edge of the table and then position the
video card so that it's in the right
spot there you go so I can actually
install that pull that back out and it
would run just that reduced bandwidth
and obviously the Atom CPU in there
probably isn't really powerful enough to
really play any games with the GPU of
that caliber but yeah it just means the
back of the slot is not closed off so
you can install whatever size cards you
want they'll just run with reduced
bandwidth we have a USB header right
here and then let's have a look at what
we've got in terms of oh here's our
front audio header as well let's look
we've got in terms of rear panel
connectivity so we have dedicated ps2
ports for mouse and keyboard we have an
optical audio out HDMI and DVI out no
VGA on this particular board there's
those heat pipes we were seeing before
two USB 2.0 ports an eSATA port two USB
3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet as well as
sorry about that and on the back we've
got 5.1 Audio although if you do want to
use a microphone then you'll probably be
limited to just headphones or 2.0 2.1
speakers here the heat pipe cooling
solution is attached via screws I like
to see that it's just more secure than
pushpins and I do appreciate it so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
associate e5 ones v 1 v io n T - I so
that's the 85 ion T - I don't forget to
