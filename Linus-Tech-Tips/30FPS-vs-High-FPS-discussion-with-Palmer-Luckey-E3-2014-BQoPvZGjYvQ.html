brought to you by HyperX fury series

Vengeance k70 and k9t RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX comm are trusted
retailer for high performance gaming pcs
hey guys I know you all expected an
oculus video from me at e3 2014 but what
I didn't expect and what I don't think
you expected was an interview with
Palmer luckily I was able to catch him
for an interview and I hope you guys
check that out alright guys we're here
at the oculus booth with Palmer which is
fantastic thank you for taking time on
your day to have this interview and I
want to ask you a question we see
certain games all the time when all
30fps is fine we're on the Xbox through
the FPS is fine and then we see on the
VR side oculus and everybody else is
something in the complete opposite
direction so what are your thoughts on
refresh rate monitors and at high FPS
games for virtual reality you need much
higher framerate than you need on a
typical screen 60fps definitely is
enough you see huge improvements up to
90 or 120 Hertz and even beyond that you
can see small improvements so be ARS
gonna need much higher frame rates than
consoles although even for consoles or
normal P traditional PC games
I don't think 30fps is is smart I don't
it's not a good art it's an artistic
decision it's a failure so that's an
amazing quote I love that now in terms
of virtual reality where do you see like
far in the future where do you see
refresh rate going what's kind of the
limit of improvement I think that you
see diminishing returns between 90 and
120 Hertz so I think that in the in the
foreseeable future VR is going to end up
somewhere in that range okay now in
terms of interacting with virtual
reality I know the first thing everyone
does and I put a headset on is try to
see their fingers now we've seen stuff
here like control VR what are your
thoughts on on like body tracking motion
tracking and haptic feedback I think
that there's a lot of interesting R&amp;amp;D
being done in public and in private and
the best solutions are not necessarily
yet announced there's a lot of stuff in
the pipe that's gonna be pretty amazing
because VR isn't just about what you're
seeing it is about being able to
interact with the world in a natural way
that says natural is looking around
the headset yeah for sure and then
another thing is I know you guys have
been playing around with the Android SDK
for oculus and there's gonna have to be
a vast difference in the experience
between what happens on Android and PC
what kind of stuff do you expect gonna
be Android I think you're going to see
things like panoramic photo capture
you're going to see virtual movie
theaters and a lot of more simple
communication and gaming experiences
then you're gonna see on PC where you're
gonna be able to really crank up the
graphics and do some cool stuff like
alien isolation that's just not gonna
happen on a mobile device so if you
order the dk2
early on your order will still be
shipping in July if you order do get DK
2 after the August shipping announcement
your shipping is still on track and if
you buy one now you should be getting
one in at August as well
our class is still flexing their
strength with the Facebook acquisition
they have hired even more people they
recently hired on a co-founder of
Naughty Dog every single time they hire
someone I'm just like holy crap you
could run your own company and you're
being hired by oculus extremely
impressive I'm extremely excited to see
what oculus has to show us in the future
I know Palmer was kind of hinting on a
few things both on the game side and on
the interaction side so I'm extremely
excited to see what that is and I hope
we see some of that in the future thank
you guys for watching this video thank
you for HyperX for sending us here this
year and also thank you to Coursera and
NCIS without all you guys we wouldn't be
able to be here and I hope you guys
