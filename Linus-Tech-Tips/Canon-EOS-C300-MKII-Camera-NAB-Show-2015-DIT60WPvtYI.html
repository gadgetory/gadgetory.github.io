out the huge cannon booth here at NAB
2015 Linus Texas coverage of NAB 2015 is
powered by Sennheiser Kingston SD cards
and Linda calm as I'm sure many of you
know cannon started the DSLR revolution
when it came to video with the 5d mark
two that camera became the standard for
low-cost cinematic video naturally that
simple video feature made its way to
other canon dslrs over the years until
cannon finally thought the natural step
forward was released these bad boys
there's cinema line of cameras the c100
c300 and see 500 and this is the newly
announced c 300 mark 2 in all of its
glory now to give you some context
cannons started shipping the original
c300 in january of 2012 so this new
version has been long overdue and lusted
after many camera owner operators have
been expecting huge improvements and I
think for the most part canon has
delivered on a lot of what people have
asked for the mark 2 supports 4k video
internally recording to see fast 2 point
0 cards and it now also has the ability
to shoot at 120 fps in both 2k and HD
while my experience operating the
original c300 is limited to a handful of
times this camera definitely has the
little improvements in all the right
places one of the biggest changes on the
mark 2 is the brand new super 35
millimeter sensor capable of up to 15
stops of dynamic range there have been a
bunch of physical changes to the mark 2
as well with some extra custom functions
all over the body a new OLED evf with an
impressive 1024 by 576 resolution with a
five thousand to one contrast ratio mark
2 also now has neutral density filters
that cut up to 10 stops of light for
those unsure of what a neutral density
filter is think of it as sunglasses for
your camera when it is too bright
outside the other interesting feature of
canons recent cameras is the inclusion
of their dual pixel autofocus playing
around with it on the show floor I was
surprisingly impressed with how natural
the rack focus is looked I can see this
being a very handy feature when you need
to pull focus without an assistant like
we generally do with our videos now on
to the biggest thing that people are
talking about before this camera the
price it costs fifteen thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine dollars for the
full set up a hefty price point compared
to other companies offerings for a
similarly spect camera two
what you pay for when buying a canon
cinema camera is a camera that is ready
to shoot out of the box and has a native
EF lens mount canon has built themselves
quite a reputation for quality glass
there are many lens owners including
myself that own a wide range of Canon EF
glass and to have a camera that natively
supports it is a very big thing time
will tell how this camera does in the
current market but i do believe canon
has made many of the improvements that
people wanted whether they are willing
to pay for them remains to be seen thank
you to sennheiser for sending us here
