to CES 2016 this year check out their
link in the video description down below
origin has changed the game in terms of
desktop a iOS now this is the Omni this
is the all-in-one that I was just
talking about and Origen has worked with
Intel on this and Samsung in terms of
the panel the panel is 34 40 by 1440 it
is ultra wide 21 by nine it's curved 60
Hertz all that fun stuff but the main
exciting part about this to be
completely honest is behind the panel
and a little bit on top the bit on top
is the USB port sounds boring but it's
for a webcam or intel realsense in the
back is kind of up to you this is an
origin computers are gonna configure the
hell out of it when you go through your
shopping cart but right now they have an
ITX motherboard which is actually
exactly what you're going to have up to
32 gigs of ram Wireless based on the ITX
motherboard storage and dot 2 is gonna
be based on your motherboard and then
you have two slots for two and a half
inch drive so you could have two
standard SSDs and maybe an MDOT 2
depending on what you get Wireless based
on the motherboard you can see that over
on the left hand side and again being
origen high end GPU support in here they
have a Titan X which is pretty freakin
badass
so right now theoretically you could
have 32 gigs of ram 2 SSDs and em to
drive at 6700 K a Titan X and a pretty 6
screen all in a very attractive very
attractive form factor now you might see
there's no back on this this isn't
finished they're still working on it and
they're gonna have different backs my
favorite one being one with a window in
it this would be super cool if you have
a desk where the back of your desk isn't
necessarily right against the wall have
a really really elegant looking computer
with a really nice backplate and a
window on it showing look this isn't
just a monitor one of the things I
really like about the omni is that it's
very sharp it's attractive a big problem
that I've had with a lot of desktop
Windows based a iOS in the past is that
they look kind of clunky or bulky or
squared off and this just you can't
apply those words to this which is great
but that's not where it ends if you
don't want it to stand on its legs you
can install a vase amount so you can put
it up on a wall you can put it on an arm
you can do pretty much whatever you want
and it's all desktop grade components so
you're not limiting yourself in any way
you'll serve all the AIO you have
and you can use all the outputs on your
graphics card so say you want to have
another monitor or you want to set up a
VR rig totally fine let me know what you
guys think in the comments down below
I'm pretty hyped to be completely honest
are you anyways let me know thanks to
Squarespace again for sending us here to
CES 2016 if you need a website maybe
because you really like making curved
things that have things in the back who
you can set up a website on Squarespace
using a whole bunch of the different
templates or set up a commerce store if
you want to sell things like USB webcams
that stick in place so they fit really
nicely on top of the Omni you can set up
cover pages if you have terrible ideas
and therefore need a new resume to get a
job somewhere else you can do tons of
stuff if you set it for a year you get a
free domain
there's 24/7 live chat support and live
email support if you're having trouble
Squarespace build it beautiful thank you
for watching stay subscribed alliance
