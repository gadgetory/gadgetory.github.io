by D brand their grip cases and prison
screen protectors mean 360 degree
protection for your phone check them out
at the link below so we are here in the
LG secret meeting room whatever it is
this was the only place that we could
actually get close to this thing and it
might not look like much we got a
speaker bar thing here we got some art
here and then two clicks of this button
and bam we've got the rollable TV so
this is their OLED TV R which is short
for revolution but we really think they
should call it the Rho LED nothing
nothing nothing
[Laughter]
alright so there's a few different ways
you can use it you can use it completely
unrolled you can use it up partially and
there's kind of some smart applications
you can see the time you can check the
weather that kind of stuff or you can
close it down entirely oh I believe the
halfway up also has music support
there's a there's a gallery thing that
you can do you can even start your music
playing roll the whole thing down and
then you've just got this discreet
looking speaker that blends in with
pretty much anything not that of course
you'd want to just use it as a speaker
because this thing is one heck of a TV
now you guys are probably thinking
there's got to be some kind of
compromise to the image quality because
of making it rollable but in actuality
this is exactly the same tech that we've
all we've already seen I mean LG's been
showing us their OLED panel technology
and all kinds of different form factors
for years now this is just the first
time aside from that short-lived sort of
curved TV thing that we saw for a bit
there this is the first time that we've
actually seen dynamic rolling in a
consumer product and the way that
they've done it is really cool so on the
show floor we got a lot of b-roll of
this thing but we weren't actually able
to get that close to it well here we can
so it's actually got these arms at the
back that I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna lower it you can see what they're
gonna do is they're gonna kind of fold
onto themselves and then we can't really
see exactly what's in here we know that
there's a four point 200 watt speaker
setup we know all the i/o and all the
power for it is in here but we can't see
exactly
how tight the TV rolls up but we have to
assume that it's going to be I guess as
loosely as they can now there's a couple
things about the mechanism that we do
know we know that it's rated for 50,000
rolls and unrolls so that would be four
times a day for 32 years and we also
know that it's extremely quiet that was
a big question mark for us down on the
show floor we weren't sure but yeah it's
actually really impressive how quiet it
is now back to things we don't know when
they're gonna ship this thing how much
it's gonna cost
we could make some guesses given that
this is their signature line and these
are generally kind of supposed to be eye
dropping as oh my goodness as opposed to
a great bang for the buck but frankly
I'm not even gonna bother I'm just gonna
sit here and admire the cool tech now
we're about to head downstairs and check
out the 8k displays that are supposed to
come on sale later this year but first
let's look at something that's really
not ready for primetime it is a great
demo so this is their 88 inch crystal
sound OLED demo and behind the panel are
five of what LG is calling exciters it
seems to be working basically there's
three that are handling the mid-range on
the bottom part of the panel and then
two that are handling the highs and
they're claiming that they're able to
get 82 I believe 140 kilohertz frequency
response out of this thing but honestly
that's not what really blew me away what
blew me away was the positionality of
the audio so whether it's for watching
movies or games they've got some really
great demos where you can really like
you can like feel the UFO moving across
the screen and then somehow from bottom
to top though I'm not sure exactly how
they did that last part hopefully we're
gonna see this coming soon because then
we can do away entirely with the
speakers and and all that other stuff I
mean okay you'll still need to put your
game console and like maybe your
computer and your set-top okay okay
we're not doing away with all this other
stuff but but no speakers now we're down
on the floor and this is the Z series
yes the entire Z series is one SKU an 88
inch 8k OLED TV that has a number of
kind of unique characteristics so number
one is that it actually comes with this
kind of artsy looking sort of frame
style stand but you
actually have to use it so we initially
looked around the back of this thing and
we were like oh that's kind of that kind
of sucks because there's no vase amount
there's no way to like really do cable
management in a in a meaningful way and
what if this height isn't right for you
what if you want like a shorter or or or
a taller stand so as it turns out the
way that it actually works is you can
take the whole thing off of the stand
and it's got these kind of downward
firing speakers and reflectors so you
can just run it as a standalone TV if
you want or you can put it on the stand
now there's not a ton that we really
know about it's got their new alpha 9
Gen 2 processor which helps with 4k to
8k upscaling as well as it uses AI to
like do better noise reduction and all
that kind of stuff and we don't really
know when it's going to be available and
we don't know pricing oh hi sorry I mean
hey guys you know you're not gonna be
able to get away from that until you
stop saying it out - - kind of I'm
just gonna like jump laughs again he's
got an lg ground with his notes right
beside the camera right now QT show I'm
not even hiding it 5 seconds to memorize
my nose that's not memorized
that's checking your phone every 5
seconds so the launch is supposed to be
sometime in q2 we have no price and it's
got Google assistant and Alexa mmm-hmm
so here's a bit of a better look at the
fancy stand so that panel in the middle
seems like it comes off for a vase
amount and in that panel gives us the
i/o we don't really know how this like
cable management they've got going on
here works but that's all kind of TBD
what has a more basic stand is there
nano cell 8k TV so just like that one
the entire lineup here is one model a 75
inch model that's 8k nano cell equipped
with the same alpha 9 gen 2 processor
and their local dimming Pro which has
twice as many dimming zones as their non
pro but we don't know how many of the
non Pro has so it's not that meaningful
we have no brightness numbers on this
but same thing should be available later
this year
what's not available later this year cuz
it's available now is the d-brane grip
the D brand grip is the super lifeproof
case from d brent it's precision cut so
it's got cutouts for your camera
fingerprint sensor whatever else you
need it's got their trademark super
clicky buttons and of course it's deep
brand so you can customize it with one
of their true textured 3m vinyl skins in
whatever look suits you best
the really cool thing that's totally
unlike anything they've done before
though is their prism screen protectors
these things are kind of unbelievable
they've got this really neat applicator
that makes it so you can put it on
perfect every time and the impact
resistance that this adds to your
display absolutely blew me away nothing
in the demo is staged you put it on you
hammer a nail in with it you take the
thing off and your screen is still
pristine underneath I mean obviously
there are limitations if you were to you
know hit it with a sledge hammer yes you
would you would shatter your entire
phone not just the screen but and I've
never seen anything quite like this in
terms of just a slap on screen
protection product so check it out at
the link in the video description guys
don't miss any of our CES 2019 coverage
probably the rest of it that you see
will be after the show actually opens
and there's not like sky jacks all over
the place but that who knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
