you don't know both swangle me up it'll
eat like a wife I had 20 people
stop and stare
I feel the eyes on me thinking how they
get me hands on my streets by pity they
all just jelly of my Imperial style and
all the as i acquire just by walking a
mile but i don't blame them
i'd be jelly too if I had to look at me
and I was forced to meet you I know you
thinking how can I turn this around be
an imperial instead of being a clown you
want to cool it be you want to take
what's mine get this help but I hear you
just fine that's it it's over now
but I can see why you tried your music
would have been quite like these except
to die
bingo rotating a perfect face kill so
forever but better luck next time
what the hell did I just watch no no no
no no all of that all that was complete
rubbish
I think Brendan actually put it best
when he first tried these headphones on
and said to me wow these are kind of
like what I'd expect premium airplane
headphones to sound like yeah in spite
of costing a hundred and twenty-five
dollars for vanilla ones and a whopping
180 dollars for these Star Wars ones
they're that bad
welcome to my review of the Star Wars
first edition Street buy 50 on your
headphones by SMS Audio this is going to
be a good one
coolermaster v-series semi modular power
supplies feature 80 plus gold efficiency
and their gold guarantee five-year
warranty click now to learn more so
first up is the packaging this magnetic
box is really nice it probably costs
about as much to make as the headphones
themselves inside you get some stickers
a certificate of gullibility our excuse
me sorry I screwed that a certificate of
authenticity you get a creased Star Wars
poster a cleaning cloth that you can use
to dry your tears when you realize how
much money you just wasted and finally a
hard carrying case for taking out your
anger as you progress through the
various stages of grief I mean let's
kick off the physical tour here if the
ear cups had had no swivel and no tilt
at all I might have been able to excuse
it as like oh they must have forgotten
that not everyone's ears are in exactly
the same place on their head but this is
just pathetic you get what 5 to 10
degrees either way fur tilt and no
swivel at all without wrenching on the
headband I mean it's a shame because if
the street by 50 on years had actually
managed to sit on my ears right at all
they may actually have been passively
comfortable thanks to their reasonably
soft ear pads and their headband pad
which is appropriately thick considering
the feather-light plastic construction
of the headphones as for the rest of the
physical tour they've got a detachable
tangle resistant cable that includes an
inline microphone and terminates with a
right-angle 4-pole connector at the
device end a pleasing soft touch and
glossy plastic ID that is accented by
your choice of Star Wars themed symbols
I chose the striking red Imperial logos
that appeared to be made out of the same
plastic as Happy Meal toys and finally a
fairly well constructed metal hinge on
each side that allows them to be folded
then unfolded with a satisfying snap
noise it's just too bad that that's the
only satisfying sound these headphones
will make I did my usual listening tasks
on an objective 2 as well as an HTC One
&amp;amp; 8 so top 40 music but this time I mix
things up with some older wrap that I
find somewhat tolerable like Coolio's
gangsta's paradise to see if different
genres of music might bring out some
hidden positive quality of this product
they
didn't the streets buy 50s performance
in my listening tests was abominable
low-end performance is the one place
where I expected them to do reasonably
well and they couldn't even do that bass
is loose muddy and uncontrolled without
even managing to rock my skull like the
Skullcandy aviators which are available
for less than half as much and the feats
by dre solos that i obtained for
comparison highs are equally weak with
the streets by 50's delivering less
clarity in every possible music track
than every other headphone that i tested
them against it's like someone hung up a
quilt between me and my speakers when i
was trying to listen to music and
finally mids are total mess compared to
the other headphones i tested too i
couldn't find a single vocalist that
sounded better on streets than any of
the other headphones with one exception
and i actually don't know how much newer
generation products have improved but
the original beats solos were actually
even worse in this regard and then
moving on past the listening tests the
pain train keeps on rolling what is
passive noise cancellation did SMS
invent a new way of blocking sound waves
to go along with their it invented word
here quiet quiescent what the hell is
that you've either got active noise
cancellation like BOCES QC 15s where new
sounds are generated by the driver to
cancel out unwanted sounds surrounding a
listener or you've got passive noise
isolation which is just thick foam a
closed back design and a good seal
against the ear to muffle the sound of
your friends telling you that you got
fleeced the worst part of all this is
that while these do feature a closed
back design they don't seal well against
my ears which appears to be a fairly
common issue so they effectively do
almost nothing about ambient noise one
quality that some folks might find
redeeming is that out of all the
headphones I tested these were the
easiest for my phone's built-in amp to
drive so to listen to music at a similar
volume compared to Sennheiser momentum
on years I had to turn my phone down
quite a few notches it's just too bad
that they sound even worse than usual
when you crank them up which brings us
to conclusion time I guess
if you don't feel like sitting through
another minute of me making fun of what
is in the running to be one of the worst
products I've ever reviewed then at
least listen to this if you have a
hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars
ish to spend on stylish durable
lightweight on your headphones that
sound fantastic
get the Sennheiser momentum on ears if
comfort is priority number one the
Skullcandy aviators sound good for the
price and look great and are extremely
comfortable alright so back to hating on
the streets I wonder where they got that
name from wait streets it rhymes with
beats rappers are pretty good at that
rhyming stuff aren't they it's just too
bad they still don't know anything about
building headphones frankly I don't know
who should be more embarrassed at this
point Disney for allowing the Star Wars
brand to be put on the actually wait
probably not there has been some pretty
terrible official Star Wars merchandise
over the years
maybe it's SMS audio for building this
appallingly bad product what about
Curtis 50-cent Jackson the third it
really made me wonder is he really
tasteless enough to think these are good
or is he just trolling us again like
with that first pitch at the Mets game
in May I mean is he legitimately
tone-deaf or is he just somewhere
rolling around in his piles of money
laughing at us as we continue to let him
and other celebrities hypnotically
compel us to buy junk with their printed
signatures on them the answer to those
questions is a definite maybe
I guess there's one positive takeaway
here though the product is great news
for people who gravitate towards
knock-offs
since not only when a Chinese ripoff
pair of streets buy 50 be less expensive
they might sound better too because I
really don't think these could have been
much worse if they tried guys thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment letting me know what do you
think of streets and beats and heats and
yeah LeBron James needs like his own
headphones mind you he's going back to
Cleveland anyway isn't he so maybe
that's not that relevant anyway guys
there's a link in the video description
to support us you can give us a monthly
contribution you can buy a cool t-shirt
with Linus tech tips on the back of it
speaking of endorsed at least I don't
sign them and finally you can change
your amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate
so we got a small kickback whenever you
buy headphones or whatever else it is
that you buy thanks again for watching
and as always don't forget to subscribe
and I'm very sorry for that rap at the
beginning walk of shame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
