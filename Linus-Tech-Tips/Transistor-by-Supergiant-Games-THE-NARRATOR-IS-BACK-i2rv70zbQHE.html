brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries hey guys we're here at
the supergiant games the boost to check
out their new game transistor if you
guys have watched the livestream much
you guys probably know that I'm a huge
fan of Bastion as I've recommended it
multiple times especially during the
steam summer sale when it was super
cheap so no problem no bro
so transistor is not basking too it is
its own game entirely what else can you
tell me about transistor transistor is
the news science fiction themed action
RPG from supergiant games that creators
of Bastion we have the whole team back
together again to work on this next
project with a handful new people and it
sort of features you know rich
hand-painted world it's like a beautiful
sort of city and it has a new
protagonist red our main character we
also have the voice of Logan Cunningham
who was the narrator of character bucks
in Bastion back as as a different
character as the voice coming from the
transistor interacting with red
throughout her journey the game is a
little bit more tactical a little bit
more strategic you can pause the game at
any time and sort of issue a bunch of
commands and you know undo them and
figure out what you wanted to do and
then execute them and see how they all
turn out so it's sort of you know
strategic game but within a more
immediate and real-time feel that's cool
he mentioned rucks or the narrator from
Bastion and that's a really big point
because they're bringing back stuff like
audio the the the music that they had in
the previous game was so good and very
very well known I have I bought the
soundtrack and listened to it actively
even though I beat the game a long time
ago and their narrator people like him
so much they're buying audio packs for
dota 2 so they can listen to him while
they play dota 2 so bringing these
elements back it's a really good idea
because it makes such a complete game
and while this isn't Bastion - you can
definitely see influences so if you're a
fan of Bastion I'd highly recommend
playing it is there any like what's your
favorite part about the game my favorite
part about the game is private music so
like daran daran is my longtime friend
I've known him since I was like 8 years
old or something like that and he's a
composer for the game he did all the
music for Bastion and you know the first
word he did was stunning and like one
BGA's and stuff and it was super cool
for me as his friend that that happened
and then to see him sort of like outdo
himself on the subs
a game has been really really awesome so
I definitely a big fan of music of the
game among the many things that I enjoy
about it yeah yeah now I don't want any
spoilers but what can you tell me about
the storyline in transistor I mean so I
can sort of tell you a little bit of
what we're showing here it's just you
know you come into the into the into the
game into the experience the character
read is there and she's got the
transistor and she hears the voice
coming from it basically urging her to
get away from this sort of mysterious
force that's pursuing her at every turn
through the city and I don't want to
give away too much but but basically
what we have here is the introduction of
that of the of the sort of forces of
antagonism that are that are trying to
lock right down and and and you know the
introduction of the game gameplay
mechanics the transistor itself all its
secrets and mysteries and powers that we
sort of let you unlock and wield over
the course of the game cool cool and I
know Bastien was on quite a few
platforms so what platforms are people
gonna be able to buy transistor on
transistor will launch on the ps4 and PC
via Steam in our website cool cool do
you have a release date for it it's
early next year yeah we don't have a
date yet I wish I knew but we're still
working on it it's got a little bit a
little bit ways to go so so yeah but
it'll be there next year really next
year yeah I'm actually happy to hear
that because very locked down release
dates are often not a good thing I'd
rather it was released when it was ready
it's very important so yeah thank you
