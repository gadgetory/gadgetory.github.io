high quality power supply with your
gaming PC delivers better efficiency it
delivers
more quiet experience and it also gives
you peace of mind because your are
valuable components that you have hooked
up to it are less likely to die in a
fiery power supply explosion which not
okay they don't actually explode that
often but what you can have in a
catastrophic power supply failure is a
power surge that fries other components
in your system less common these days
especially with high quality units like
this particular one but what a lot of
users don't consider is what kind of
power you're actually feeding into your
power supply so here we have what's
called a UPS or an uninterruptible power
supply this one's from cyber power and
it is capable of a couple of things so
number one is that it is light
interactive which means that it is
actually regulating and monitoring and
cleaning the power that you are get open
the box the power that you are actually
feeding into the power supply that is
then powering your computer so it means
there's less strain on your power supply
and less chance of failure and an
overall more stable computing experience
people will say oh I live in the first
world my power is really good no no no
no no no no no no even new buildings
even in the first world even wherever
you are no matter what you can have
dirty AC power so that means whether
it's little spikes or little dips
sometimes the dips are experienced as
what's called a brownout where you'll
see the lights dim a little bit so yes
these problems do exist and they are
important a UPS also that's really heavy
because it's full of lead batteries a
UPS also will allow you to have time to
save your work and shut down your
computer correctly in the event of a
power failure so give me a second here
guys I'm just gonna go down what cyber
power has to say for themselves before I
keep going any longer so power
protection for computers and
workstations that use active power
factor correction some more on that in a
moment green power ups energy saving
technology power panel UPS management
software so that's the software you use
to well manage the UPS multifunction LCD
power status display so we're going to
do a full NCIS
episode on the swim so you'll see that
on my NCIX comm channel automatic
voltage regulation 10 surge protected
outlets 5 with battery backup so that is
5 surge protected 5 battery backup phone
coax line protection 3-year warranty and
connected equipment guarantee now that's
really cool because they will actually
even guarantee that the equipment you
have connected to it is not going to
explode so this guy right here is
capable of sustaining up to 600 watts
and there we go that means that assuming
you have a PC computer actually hooked
up to it we're going to test this with a
high-powered gaming PC so I'm not even
going to bother telling you guys how
long it claims to run the connected
computer for we're actually going to
test it with benchmarking software so it
will run your computer and give you a
chance to either using the USB interface
automatically shut down your PC properly
in the event of a power failure or give
you a chance if you're actually in the
middle of using it to turn it off
correctly so that's good for your
software it's good for your hardware
it's good for a lot of things so so far
the benefits are a couple ok
safely powering on and powering off your
computer as well as the other thing that
I said right protecting your computer
from dirty power now here's the catch
most UPS's that are not extremely
expensive are not pure sine-wave UPS's
so I don't know if you guys know
anything about AC current but it
basically looks like this it goes in
what's called a sine wave and 120 volts
is the difference between the dip and
the peak so that's your 120 volt power
or if you're in the EU or somewhere else
where you have 240 volt power you just
have a bigger a bigger sine wave okay so
a non pure sine wave ups because these
are using batteries okay they're using
batteries inside here to deliver AC
power batteries do not natively deliver
AC power they deliver DC power so they
have to kind of fake it so um less
competitive modern you know I don't know
what to call them but not as good UPS is
will deliver current that looks like
this where it actually has a square sine
wave pattern now this is fine as an
approximation of a sine wave if you're
going to power a light bulb or if you're
going to power something that is not a
sensitive piece of electronic equipment
in comes active power factor correction
now I haven't actually looked for it on
this power supply but I guarantee you
anything that is over 80 plus bronze is
going to have a PFC pretty much and I'm
sorry it's not on here but trust me it
does it has active power factor
correction almost any modern power
supply that is a high-quality power
supply does that allows it to achieve
better efficiency active power factor
correction will not accept an ugly
square sine wave so if you don't have a
pure sine wave UPS and cyber power in
this case has some very very low cost
compared to other active compared to
other pure sine wave models so if you
don't have a pure sine wave UPS what can
happen is your computer can just shut
down alright as soon as it gets that
square pattern voltage input okay so
okay we'll look at the unit a little bit
here in the unboxing but the most
important part of this video is guys
subscribe to my NCI XCOM Channel NCI
ex-ceo M because we're going to show you
guys this one versus a non pure sine
wave unit to show you what happens in
the event of a power failure with either
of these battery backup solutions so
we'll have a look at the unit itself
really quickly here most of this has
been like theoretical stuff so what do
we got we got your display button we got
your silence alarm button your control
button LCD readout you got your power
button all this is fairly
straightforward on the top here we have
some important notes about safety
features and powering on and powering
off and all that kind of good stuff here
we've got some ventilation holes okay a
lot more attractive than UPS's used to
be risk of electric shock refer to the
bottom of the unit for cautionary
markings pool more cautionary markings
neat something to be aware of with UPS's
is that eventually the batteries inside
will die and they can be replaced or you
can get a new UPS or whatever but I
still definitely recommend using them as
it mentioned on the packaging there's
coax protection as well as phone /
network protection an interesting
building wiring fault indicator serial
and USB interfaces as well as the here
we go
Serg and battery plus surge outlets on
the back and a way to reset the breaker
nice beefy power cord because if you're
going to be powering any reasonable
amount of equipment off of it you're
going to need that so as mentioned
before 600 watt unit stay tuned for the
NCIX tech tips and thank you for
checking out my cyber power adaptive
sine wave uninterruptible power supply
