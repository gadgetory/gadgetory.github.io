something that is so bizarre that
whether it's a good value or not we kind
of just have to buy it and that's
exactly what happened on taobao.com this
my friends is a core i7 4728 q what's a
4728 q is a solder only processor for
laptops I mean it's a few generations
old but it actually performs pretty
decent but this is what's weird about it
it's a 4728 q and it looks like they
have jerry-rigged like a heat spreader
and a substrate for it so that you could
install it in a desktop motherboard so
at translate it to a hundred and twenty
three canadian roubles is it a good deal
well we got it so I guess we go find out
today's video is brought to you by
Origin PC Origin BC builds custom
desktops and high-performance laptops
with free lifetime 24/7 tech support and
they only use high-end components like
Samsung's 970 Evo pro m2 SSD visit
Origin PC today at the link below for a
special promotion
so step number one a guess is inspect
the goods because when you order from
like weird random Chinese sites and like
how long this didn't take to come just
over a week dang that's not bad but when
you order from these kinds of sites you
kind of never know what kind of
experience you're gonna have so the
first thing that stands out to me is
that this heat spreader is clearly
custom milled by whoever is finding
these CPUs wherever the heck they're
finding them here I'm gonna flip them
over and this is where stuff gets really
crazy so this is a 4790k and this is a
forty seven twenty HQ so desktop chip
mobile chip so you can actually that's
great you can see the comparison between
the thickness of them but this is nuts
you can actually see the ball grid array
soldering job between the original CPU
and then this like aftermarket substrate
here and then you can also see that not
all the contact pads seem to be actually
mapped to anything like some of them
look blank like they don't have a trace
running to them which is especially
weird because the mobile versions of
these fourth generation processors
actually had more pins on the bottom of
them than the desktop ones so how do you
map more to less how do you find a board
and it'll work in you guess now to be
clear the manufacturer does list the
compatible chipsets
so anything z87 z97 and then the more
mainstream versions of that a couple of
generations theoretically should work
but cpu compatibility from board to
board is not always as cut and dried as
that so we just kind of grabbed the best
bet z87 board we had lying around and oh
boy we are running up against our first
hiccup here so on a typical Intel LGA
1150 PU you've got these little tabs
here these are for these to push the CPU
down into the socket make sure these
pads are making good contact with the
pins well it's too thick because you've
effectively got like two substrates
worth here so they gotta cut it
I can come back up now we're gonna break
this thing for sure
oh crap that's coming out of the socket
oh if it falls back in the socket that
sockets probably dead so we're gonna go
ahead and throw this little just washer
in here use that as a spacer and then
hopefully we'll be able to install it
properly all right so that's it
mobile CPU desktop motherboard you guys
saw it here first that is unless you've
seen this somewhere else in which case
east side here second or third or
whatever all right
but Maya cooler back home I like their
shiny or heat spreader be very careful
that you aren't announcing your CPU with
too much pressure because I'm pretty
sure that's what killed that pfSense
project that I was working on like three
times too much pressure is bad for the
board so this is z87 which means we're
gonna be using ddr3 memory and we
actually had really good luck with these
particular g.skill ripjaws kits over the
years of course that we have them one
board left from this generation that
doesn't have stupid board power switches
there we go
hey it actually detects it hore i seven
forty seven twenty I wasn't done with
that
oh there we go 47:20 HQ 16 gigs ram our
SSDs working press f1 to run set up heck
yeah Wow I was painless 26 degree
temperatures that looks fine voltage
zero degrees that looks less huh okay so
the thing about cpu compatibility is
that sometimes you can get things to
work that artificially supported in fact
there are people who have gotten coffee
like CPUs to run in like Zee 270 and
z170 boards but you might run into some
unpredictable behavior so let's go ahead
and jump into advanced mode here and see
what else we can dig up I'm having fun
like what is the cache voltage read and
the core voltage doesn't system agent
voltage is fine too these are all CPU
voltages of one like one or another here
we go I mean everything is actually
showing up like totally normally why do
you not install Chrome yeah not just
like is very inconvenient because then
we have to use edge and then we have to
just manually type wow this is very
important news worst ever
ress the worst ever so everything has
been shockingly painless so far we fire
up task manager all four cores all eight
threads are all detected so Wow both
speed step power saving and turbo boost
are working who was it like which
Chinese reseller was like you know what
we have too many 4720 age queues
whatever shall we do with these you know
what let's spend a bunch of time getting
them working in desktop motherboard do
as part of that so our next step because
you would think the benefit of a mobile
processor would be that it would be very
power efficient and it would be very
cool so we want to find out just how
cool it is
so our next step here is we're running a
stress test so we're using intel burn
tests and then we're using hardware
monitor in order to monitor our CPU
temperatures now a potential benefit of
using a mobile processor would be that
you'd have less heat output and less
power consumption so theoretically
compared to a 4770k which was the
desktop equivalent at that time we
should run
much cooler so we're gonna go ahead and
we're gonna run this guy for a little
while and then see how it's looking but
quite frankly I am feeling pretty good
so far because we've had this running
already for about a minute and our
maximum - oh it just jumped it was
sitting at about 40 degrees still this
is very respectable somewhere in the 60s
65 degrees Celsius range and that's
right on the dies I told you it's all
the way in I dunno how to man to see the
first time if you're saying that so
that's pretty impressive we're stable
which was not a given and we're running
about 20 degrees cooler than a 4770k but
there's a clear trade-off here so our
maximum turbo speed is only about 3.4
gigahertz compared to 3.9 on a 4770k +
that would be an overclockable chip so
let's see what that translates to in
terms of perform
so we decided to pair our cpu with the
gtx 1060 because i mean the reality of
it is if you're trying to spend a
hundred dollars on the cpu off pal
Baucom your weren't buying an RT x20
atti that wouldn't be a good match
anyway so we still think 1920 by 1080 we
should be able to get darn near very
high or even ultra details even in a
triple a game like shadow of the Tomb
Raider so let's just see that is as long
as our CPU can keep up this is really
impressive I mean other than some wicked
tearing when we Pan the camera around
which is I mean we're not using g-sync
or freeze things to that and it comes
with the territory this is running
really smooth so it did a great job with
shadow of the Tomb Raider it actually
ended up performing nearly identically
who are 4770k which means we could even
go higher than a gtx 1060 graphics card
and still be getting the full experience
bearing in mind of course that we had
our details cranked meaning that we are
less likely to be CPU bound let's move
on to another title you're using a hard
drive I haven't and impressively our
gaming performance story doesn't really
change with assassin's creed origins or
gta5 both of them were within five to
ten percent of the performance which as
long as we're getting a pretty good
price difference means that this could
make a ton of sense for someone who
wants to game on the cheap bringing us
them to our last gaming test the one
that separates the men from the boys
when it comes to CPU gaming performance
CS go
blah blah
oh crap so clearly it's usable and more
than that it was actually within again
10 20 frames per second of our 4770k
which I don't know what is that like
three percent or something stupid like
that like not even much of a difference
but I guess that's kinda to be expected
because our low core count turbo is a
little bit higher than our all core
turbo so we're running Cinebench now and
you can see we're maxing out at three
point four gigahertz so I'm gonna be
curious to see how our score here stacks
up to a 4770k because even gamers
occasionally do something else on their
computers 670 100k that's not impressive
what's that 4770k 746 so yeah that's
definitely gonna be a noticeable
difference if you are actually doing any
3d rendering or if you're editing video
or something like that but probably not
the end of the world I guess the real
question here becomes one of value so
here's the deal we ran all our numbers
through again this time with an eighty
seven hundred case so remember this is
more like a three hundred and seventy US
dollar CPU and obviously there is a
performance improvement but if you're
looking at it from a pure bang for the
buck perspective these fourth gen CPUs
hold up incredibly well in modern games
so the question really becomes do you
grab a used forty seven seventy or 4790k
on ebay like a legitimate processor that
was actually designed to go in the
motherboard or do you go that's how bow
route now one of these is gonna cost you
somewhere in the neighborhood of around
two hundred US dollars so you factor in
another fifty bucks for your motherboard
another 80 bucks assuming that you want
16 gigs of ddr3 memory of some sort and
you're looking at what's that add up to
50 you goes to
three hundred and thirty dollars which
means if you could save a considerable
amount here you'd be sitting pretty
peachy keen and on the surface of things
anyway that is exactly what our table
CPU manages to achieve because based on
the pricing on the website you could
save almost half the price of the CPU I
mean of course you still need
motherboard and you still need the RAM
and all that but saving even $80 on a
budget gaming rig is a lot more money to
put into I mean you could you can do a
lot of things with 80 bucks you could
get a better graphics card you could get
a solid-state drive like it makes a huge
difference you could get out a ball in a
cooler for example the issue for us is
that it just didn't end up actually
working out that way
so after we placed our order the Taobao
seller contacted us and wanted another
lows at thirty five or forty five forty
five US dollars for taxes and customs
clearance into Canada a situation that
you might run into so now we're sitting
up within a boat you know thirty dollars
then when the package arrived we ended
up having to pay another fifteen bucks
at the door so the issue here is that by
the time we actually get this thing to
our doorstep it's kind of ghetto you
can't use the stock cooler meaning you
got to factor that into your price and
you've paid almost as much for it as a
normal CPU meaning that it's really cool
and I'm glad we bought one for the tech
museum here at Linus media group but I
probably wouldn't recommend it t forces
excalibur specialism ddr4 ram features a
unique totem pattern design ultra-wide
120° panel lighting speeds of thirty six
hundred to four thousand megahertz and
support for a variety of RGB software
like our sync RGB fusion and more it's
compatible with XMP 2.0 one-step
overclocking and they've worked with
motherboard manufacturers to get their
sticks qvl approved check out the link
below to learn more so thanks for
watching guys if you disliked this video
then you can hit that
but if you liked it cuz it's just cool
then you can hit the like button get
subscribed wait I tell them to hit the
like button if they disliked it whatever
everyone hit the like button you can get
subscribed you can check out where to
buy the stuff we featured at the link in
the video description or while you're
down there you can check out our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which is
definitely worth a joint that this
shirts not but they're like this in the
sense that they are aligned aesthetic
see no like really though like it's got
this be mounting hardware and stuff and
it's like in the way can we can we throw
it away
okay can we throw it away anyway though
it's stupid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
