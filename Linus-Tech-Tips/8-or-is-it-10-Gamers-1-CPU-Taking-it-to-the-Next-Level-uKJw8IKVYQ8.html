out over here was one of the most
successful videos in every way that I
have ever made so I determined almost
immediately that I had to follow it up
somehow but one of the biggest
criticisms of seven gamers was that it
was kind of over-the-top and impractical
so in working on a sequel I called up a
friend of mine for some advice hey yeah
Mikey you've got experience with dealing
with negative feedback about your
over-the-top style how would you respond
and that my friends is how eight gamers
one CPU was born
Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the web as
though you're in one of 20 different
countries learn more and try tunnel bear
for free at the link in the video
description ok but for real
the objectives of eight gamers were
several one I did want to outdo the
original project two I wanted the
machine to have some kind of practical
application if not today then at some
point in the future and three I wanted
the hardware to actually behave
predictably in this kind of a use case
between the WS board and the r9 nanos
that last machine was a nightmare I'm
fairly certain I was the first person
and only including a soos R&amp;amp;D to ever
try seven cards in that board at a time
so the recipe started as it always seems
to with Intel Inside four months leading
up to the release I had been harassing
my contacts all of them about
availability of 22 core Broadwell EP
$26.99 v4 processors so that I could
pack forty four cores that is 80 eight
threads of CPU power into this monster
and they came through and for that
matter so did Kingston with eight 32 gig
sticks of quad-channel
ECC ddr4 server memory along with a
bunch of one terabyte SSDs that I
divvied up into 16 gigs of RAM and one
terabyte worth of space for each of my
VMs we've actually about a hundred gigs
of RAM left over for unread because yes
my friends on raid is returning for more
virtualized gaming action now some folks
have asked why I continue to use unread
for these projects instead of something
like KVM from Red Hat or VMware well
there are a few reasons one on raid uses
KTM it's open source 2 it handles GPU
pass-through which is important for the
impressive near bare metal performance
in gaming applications that we measured
in this video really really well
and three it's pooled safe storage is an
easy way to manage data across multiple
VMs and I've got another clever trick to
show you guys this time - all right so
that's all fine and good and very
similar to last time so what's the
difference then Linus well first up is
the super micro sys 4028 gr - t RT a
dual LGA 2011 3 Xeon 24 memory slot 24
SSD slot bare-bones server designed for
high computational density applications
like scientific research and simulation
functionality is enabled by its 11 PCI
Express 16x slots 8 of which are
advertised as being ready for a graphics
card or compute card like a xeon phi or
nvidia tesla though perhaps more than 8
is possible with some extra power cables
running from its for redundant 1000 watt
power supplies more on that later the
other main difference is in the graphics
cards
thanks to AMD's half-ass relinquishing
of hardware resources when you soft
reset a system the entire host last time
needed to be shut down every time I had
to reset a single VM for a driver
installation or a crash or whatever else
so I cried about my sad story - ZOTAC
and they not only Poe need up eight of
their top-of-the-line gtx 980ti
amp video cards to ensure that each of
my gamers would have a perfect gaming
experience but they also contributed the
thin clients that I needed for this very
different implementation for each of
their ZBOX B Series and C series with
low-power Intel processors we actually
covered so Tech's wide variety of quiet
sometimes shockingly powerful mini pcs
in the past and combining these with
some HyperX odium memory modules and 240
gig SSDs from kingston we had some
awesome client boxes to hook up the
gorgeous 27 inch IPS 4k 27u d88 free
sync gaming monitors that LG
provided because eight gamers one CPU is
all about my vision for a high-tech
household in the future something I've
talked about before on the LAN show a
high powered machine in the closet that
can allocate preferably dynamically
computing power gaming or even otherwise
to wherever it's needed a TV or
projector as many desktops or laptops
spread throughout the building as needed
or even a handheld device like an Nvidia
shield portable I wanted effectively to
build my own Nvidia grid but with
consumer GPUs and using Valve's steam
in-home streaming to serve to all my
clients not something they had in mind
for it I'm sure so let's talk then about
the set up process was it actually
simpler well the hardware was less flaky
this time which means that this
hyperspeed set-up guide for unread that
you guys are looking at went much
smoother copy files to USB Drive make
Drive bootable assigned SSDs to cache
for high-speed OS and game drives assign
larger drives to the array for mass
storage create VMs share storage between
the VMs which whoa slow down there John
Kingston sent us like ten of their SSDs
for this and you just shared data
between virtual disks at the time of
creation so on a single pair byte of
storage you could have ten VMs each with
200 gigs of Windows games other base
applications and a hundred gigs each of
dedicated storage very efficient
hopefully that feature makes it into the
web GUI at some point so all of that was
fine then but be this advantage to a
networked solution like this is that
while in theory you can manage the
entire setup from a single terminal
somewhere else in the building in
practice Remote Desktop connections
session management required this little
trick I found on the steam forums to
disconnect in such a way as to not Bork
steam in-home streaming then I needed to
reach out to fit PC who whipped me up 10
prototypes of their new 4k headless HDMI
dongle that can handle up to 4k 60 Hertz
and allows the video cards HDMI audio
device to be active on a remote client
this is needed unless you wouldn't want
to install a bunch of sound cards or
something like that so then finally
after all of that it was time to get all
my gamers to sign in to steam on the
server side using TeamViewer and on the
client side on their machines that
ranged from comfortable gaming seats to
less comfortable gaming seats and after
fighting with some of the weirdness get
things fired up all right now cuz I know
for this game let's I the controls do
feel a little bit laggy but I think part
of that is just the god-awful vehicle
controls with keyboard and mouse on GTA
my gaming experience has so far been
relatively normal
it was indoors for the most part but now
that it's outdoors it seems like the
graphics quality actually takes a dip
sometimes so far I started the game up I
got through the intros and then somebody
pointed out that my game is going to
slow-mo which it does look like it in
effect is going in slow-mo no I don't
feel like I'm gaming on anything that's
McWhorter I started playing and I'm like
playing and I'm like assuming that the
tower was just under the desk and then
it like glitched out and then I was like
wait and then I like thought about it
and I was like oh latency pretty smooth
like it is pretty seamless it doesn't
seem like I said it doesn't seem like
I'm running remotely it feels like I'm
um hooked up like a full fat gaming
power less than perfect but almost a
little bit laggy but like a little bit
compression that I notice from the
streaming but other than that it's like
it's pretty good would you consider
putting your gaming machine in a closet
and beaming it tiffin clients on you TV
or I was playing csgo then no but for
any other game I think it would be
perfectly fine I don't know about
switchy but maybe consider adding it um
because I don't think I want to hide my
rig like a closet somewhere but at the
same time UVU
the root I don't want to be sitting idly
be tethered to light you know a battle
station or something I want to be Belle
swear so so that could be really good so
I think the conclusion here is pretty
straightforward
while we pushed the hardware and the
software and our networking
infrastructure I mean we are streaming a
lot of data right now to the limits most
people's experiences are actually
surprisingly good and while I don't
think we're ready for land centers for
example to just have a server room with
a bunch of machines you can see there I
just ran into an issue I'll loop I was
just a hiccup for well I don't think
we're ready for land centers to just
have you know a server rack in a closet
somewhere and a bunch of thin clients
spread out throughout the land center I
don't think we're that far away and
seeing it perform as well as it did
especially considering the fact that
we're running gtx 980ti s and titan X's
all sandwiched next to each other with
many of them thermal throttling is
pretty darn impressive and I hope you
guys can agree and look forward like me
to a future where you can just have one
box that powers the gaming experiences
of an entire household of people as
computers continue to get more and more
powerful and I hope you can also agree
that this is a somewhat more practical
application of this technology than just
having a bunch of people plugged into
and gathered around a single tower which
is why I wanted to do it as a follow-up
I guess this is sort of networking
related because today's video sponsor is
tunnel they're the easy to use VPN app
for mobile and desktop tunnel bear lets
you tunnel through up to 20 different
countries allowing you to browse the
internet and use online services as
though you are in a different country
they've got apps for iOS Android PC and
Mac they also have a Chrome extension
and it's easy to use no DNS
reconfiguration port forwarding any of
that nonsense you just pick your country
you flip the switch and boom your
connection gets encrypted and it appears
to the websites and so
services you're using as though you are
sitting in a different country than the
one you were in and the best part of
tunnel bears you can try it for free no
strings attached with 500 megabytes of
free monthly data just by checking out
the link in the video description and if
you decide hey I like tunnel bear I'd
love to pay a reasonable amount monthly
for an unlimited plan well you can save
10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
also linked in the video description
sort of the same link

up there you can you know buy one of
these LG monitors one of these ZOTAC fin
clients one of those fantastic 22 core
Broadwell EP CPUs or maybe just a new
video card from our friends over at
ZOTAC or just anything you want actually
even toilet paper helps us out a lot you

done all that stuff your wondering what
to watch next
hey if you haven't already check out the
original 7 gamers 1 CPU it is pretty
different actually surprisingly so so
don't miss it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
