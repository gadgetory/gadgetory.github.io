unboxing of the EVGA GeForce GTX 570 so
this is in videos latest addition to
their gtx 500 series family so the first
card with the gtx 500 series name was
the GTX 580 so that was if you followed
in videos naming schemes over the last
well I guess the last few generations
the 80 would be the highest end single
GPU typically although we have seen it
an 85 which was a refresh and then the
70 would be the next one down so this is
basically a slightly a slightly cut-down
GTX 580 so here as we get this open I'll
tell you some of the key differences
between the 570 and the 580 so first of
all the 570 has fewer functional units
so that is fewer shaders fewer CUDA
cores all of that kind of stuff okay
it also has less RAM so I'm going to
show you guys the box now we're going to
sort of talk about that for a bit it has
less video memory so that's only one
point two eight gigabytes versus the 1.5
gigs on the GTX 580 so even though this
has less video memory than the GTX 480
right now it looks like performance is
quite similar power consumption is much
lower and yeah it looks like obviously
the price is quite a bit lower as well
we've got full support for NVIDIA latest
technologies including 3d vision
surround physics DirectX 11 and SLI and
that includes 3-way SLI on this
particular card let's go ahead and have
a look at the back I think there's not
much here that we don't already know
very very similar specs overall to the
GTX 580 the key differences are like I
said before it is a little bit more
cut-down it's a little bit slower but it
also comes in at a very attractive price
so it comes with a poster which I'm
going to
ahead so carefully unfold here for you
guys an EVGA gaming poster no less which
is a skull with some like wicked like
guns or something okay very nice very
nice got you vga then we have a user
guide which shows you presumably how to
install it how to install your drivers
we have a driver disk don't use this
download the latest off the nvidia
website as well as a powered by EVGA
sticker for the front of your case next
we have the accessories I like EVGA is
environmentally friendly and recyclable
packaging which you can clearly see here
let's have a look at what we've bought
in terms of accessories so the first
thing we have is a mini HDMI to HDMI
cable and EVGA is classic shiny wrapper
with EVGA logo on the back I haven't
actually seen that with a graphics card
before I've only really seen that in
there our motherboard packages so then
we've got a dual molex to PCIe 6 pin
adapter another of the same and finally
a DVI to VGA adapter although if you're
really upgrading to a 350 dollar
graphics card today please PLEASE
upgrade your monitor if you're still
using VGA please alright next we have a
little warning please allow the graphics
card to cool for a minimum of 2 minutes
after operation before removing it from
your system interesting you don't want
to burn yourself after all alright and
let's go ahead and take off the caution
electrostatic sensitive devices do not
open your handle accept it ecstatic free
workstation let's get this card out I've
actually got a GTX 580 here with me for
comparison so we'll be able to hold them
up next to each other alright so the
first thing we see is that the gtx 570
looks very similar to the 580 the
overall shrouded cooler design is
something that we've seen on nvidia
cards since gee pretty much the 8800
series where we've got a
a fan at the back here so this is a PWM
controlled fan and we better hold on
pause for a minute and we've also got a
little EVGA sticker here so I'm just
going to go ahead and remove the gun if
I can remove the cover on it and I'll go
ahead and remove that here we are okay
cool okay and then we've got a rear
exhaust sort of setup so you can see
there's actually no access to the fan
whatsoever through here we can just see
the the shroud itself and then if we
move around to the other side you can
see that all of the air is being
exhausted out of the case now there's a
couple different design philosophies for
video card coolers so one of them is
that the video card because it produces
a lot of heat inside the case should be
cooled sort of adequately but we should
remove as much of the heat as possible
from the case through an exhaust vent
whereas the other philosophy is that we
should design sort of a more open air
cooler that does a better job of cooling
the VGA core frankly but exhausts heat
inside the case so the air were using to
cool the video card isn't actually as
cool so there's obviously EVGA s taken
the nvidia reference design approach to
this one using the rear exhaust cooler
so we've got two 6-pin PCI II power
connectors up here at the top couple
EVGA stickers then we've also got SLI
headers that are compatible with both
two-way so you just use a single header
as well as 3-way SLI moving around to
the back which we actually sort of
looked at already but I'll show you
again we have two DVI connectors one
mini HDMI please do note you can only
use two at a time so either this one and
this one or this one so you can't use
all three at the same time to get NVIDIA
surround going you do have to have two
matching gtx 570 cards the back of the
PCB actually looks pretty much identical
to the 580 from what from what I can
recall so what we'd probably find if we
took the cooler off is that even though
there's solder points for all of this
memory actually here you can clearly see
there's components on the back here
but these ones don't have memory chips
installed on them so that's where we get
the difference in ram Kapoor
between the 570 and the 580 we've got a
standard PCI Express 16x interface down
here at the bottom that is PCI Express 2
so it's double the bandwidth of the old
PCI Express 1 and I think that's pretty
much everything there is to say about it
EVGA s I guess their value at their
brand value is a few different things
first of all they have their step-up
program which allows you within a
certain window of time to take your gtx
570 let's say nvidia you know kind of
have the 570 on the market only for like
a month and then they go and release
like 1/2 575 or something EVGA step-up
program allows you to trade in your old
570 and then pay like at the difference
to get the new 575 so it's a pretty cool
program they also have their lifetime
warranty as well as 24/7 tech support so
those are some of the EVGA differences
and i'll actually show you guys also
what they had to say for themselves so
besides their EVGA precision tool which
is an overclocking utility they've also
got some of their selling points here so
that the number one seller they're the
number one in reliability and service
according to some surveys somewhere and
they're the performance leader in 3dmark
Vantage although 3d mark 11 was released
today so it's going to be off to the
races all over again for all the crazy
overclocking guys and then number one
folding at home team in the world so
