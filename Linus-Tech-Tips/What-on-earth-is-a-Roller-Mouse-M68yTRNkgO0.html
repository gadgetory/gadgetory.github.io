right faster we don't get 10 scripts
written by the time Linus gets back he's
gonna make us go to the lucky room
not the lucky fruit sir
they're moving as fast as they can but
having to move their hands from the
mouse the keyboard is taking up valuable
time not to mention the repetitive
motion to straining their hands
ai dios mio
not today lucky not today yeah that's
that's not what it's like to use this
thing it's kind of janky but it's
actually not as janky as it looks
private Internet access that's exactly
what you'll get with PIAA a safe and
protected IP and it's got loads of other
features as well check it out at the
link in the video description the roller
mouse red Wireless belongs to that kooky
corner of the tech industry that doesn't
try to give us the coolest-looking most
game errific products to help us get
more headshots know the tribe that this
gadget belongs to is the one trying to
delay the slow death by sitting that all
heavy PC users inevitably fall victim to
and if they have to make a weird Rolly
wrist rest mouse thing to do that by
golly so be it they're saving your life
for pete's sake now the idea
according to contour who makes the
roller Mouse is that the motion of
moving your hand over to your mouse and
back to your keyboard is one of the
major culprits that can cause repetitive
strain injury or RSI moving your hand
down a few inches instead of a foot or
so to the side is definitely improvement
in that regard but how effective is it
whereas other organ AMA cows designs
like vertical mice allow your hand to
rest in a neutral handshake like
position the roller mouse still requires
you to pronate your wrist that means
your wrist is rotated inward causing the
radius and ulna bones in your arm to
criss cross so while it eliminates that
repetitive side motion it's still not
perfectly ergonomic but are any of us
now I called this thing weird earlier
but as far as economic peripherals go
the roller mouse doesn't look
bad I mean yeah the concept of using a
big roller as your mouse is unusual but
the whole device itself looks kind of
classy its structure is metal with a
silver black and red aesthetic and these
nice leatherette coverings on the wrist
rest hmm it does not look or feel like a
cheap device of a break after a couple
weeks which is good because it's not
cheap it's 265 bucks but the price might
be worth it if it saves you some trips
to the chiropractor to fix your screwed
up shoulder do you go to the
chiropractor for that is it
physiotherapist acupuncture so here's
how the roller mouse works rolling the
bar up or down translates to vertical
mouse movement and sliding the bar
translates to horizontal mouse movement
it ends up feeling a lot like using a
trackpad on a laptop from an alien
planet
where everyone has wheels for hands and
this was the best solution they could
come up with now you can either click by
pushing down on the roller bar itself or
by using the surprisingly high-quality
left-click button on the module below
the roller bar there you'll also find
buttons for the right click double click
copy paste cursor speed and a scroll
wheel which also serves as a middle
click on the left side is a microUSB
port for charging contour claims it can
last three months on a single charge and
on the bottom there's the power switch
and a little cavity to hold the USB
dongle then using the roller mouse is as
I mentioned a lot like using the
trackpad on your laptop and because of
that I was able to adapt to it pretty
quickly initially I found it necessary
to move both hands down to use my right
hand for the roller bar and click with
my left hand but after a few hours
one-handed use was no problem I found
the best style for me is to manipulate
the roller bar with one finger the
scroll wheel with another and use my
thumb to left-click since you can remap
the double click button to also serve as
a left right or middle click there are a
few other minor customization options
here as well like changing the force
required to activate the click on the
roller bar or disabling the click
altogether now this being an ergonomic
device there are also some things you
can do to make the whole set
more ergonomic it comes with these
risers that can raise or lower your
keyboards height and angle to be flat
with the roller mouse and there's also
two other types of wrist rest
attachments available the red plus palm
support for 20 bucks and the arm support
red for another 150 bucks wha no wait is
this product dumb it might be see while
the touchpad like nature of the roller
mouse makes it easy to learn it also
makes the benefits a real touch pad has
over the roller mouse much more obvious
pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling
are the obvious examples but a number of
people in the office also remarked that
the roller bar design seems less
responsive and precise than their laptop
trackpad moving the bar all the way to
the right or left will make the cursor
snap to that side of the screen so at
times you can't just drag the mouse
directly to where you want it the cursor
will often go past your intended
destination and then you have to bring
it back now to be fair I used this on my
ultrawide monitor at my desk and it was
more of a problem there than it would be
on a regular 16 by 9 display but still
with all these buttons I wish they'd
have programmed one of them to pause
Mouse movement like on the key Mouse
that James reviewed so I can you know
recenter the bar that might have helped
with the feeling that I was fighting the
cursor sometimes
and like I mentioned earlier while you
are skipping the lateral motion of
reaching for your mouse which could be
the solution for your particular elbow
RSI for example it doesn't solve
everything your wrist is still pronated
and you're still dealing with ulnar
deviation while using the roller bar
that is laterally bending your wrist
like this so while the roller mouse
might be better ergonomically for people
with certain RSIs
I don't think I'd recommend it for the
general public now that said I do find
this whole idea of integrating a wrist
rest with a mouse to be pretty
interesting and while reviewing the
roller mouse there were times where I
liked having the mouse control right
there already under my fingertips what I
think would be really cool though is
something like this but with a touchpad
so I could also use gestures like pinch
to zoom and to finger scrolling sadly
while there are a number of other wrist
rest devices with a similar roller bar
type of design I couldn't find any wrist
rest touch pads now you can buy good
desktop touch pads for less than half
the price of this thing if you want to
try it out it's really too bad the
roller mouse is so expensive I really
wanted to believe speaking of things I
can believe in our sponsor this plate
makes magnet mounted metal prints that
are durable and don't require any power
tools in order to hang them they've got
over a quarter million different artwork
spanning a bunch of different styles and
influences and with their easy magnetic
mounting there's no holes in the wall
and you can easily replace them they
plant ten trees for every display
purchased and you can use code Ltd to
save 15% through the link in the video
description alright thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit the like button or check
out the link below to where to buy the
stuff we featured probably won't be this
may be some touch pads or something also
linked in the description is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one
it's a processor and our community forum
which you should totally join you should
