meaning that we have the next
installment in the Battlefield franchise
namely battlefield 1 which is actually
the fifth get 812 240 third I don't know
anyways wacky naming convention aside
battlefield 1 is a hyped enough game
that it might actually get you thinking
about upgrading your current system it's
absolutely beautiful so what hardware
combo should you be looking at let's
find out in our battlefield 1 video card
showdown featuring CPU cores and memory
and like some other stuff
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so battlefield one
like I said it's an undoubtedly
beautiful game but what do you need
hardware wise to run it well enough to
make you feel like you're really in the
thick of it mustard gas and all we not
only answer this question by looking at
how it performed on current GPUs like we
normally do from AMD and NVIDIA but also
like I said we tried different CPU core
configurations and RAM setups as well
and these benchmarks are what we'll be
looking at first for the CPU tests we
paired Intel skylake CPUs with the new
Pascal based Titan X or Titan XP from
Nvidia as well as 32 gigs of fast ddr4
Ram to ensure we wouldn't have any other
bottlenecks at 4k and the ultra preset
pretty much every CPU from a 10 core
with hyper threading down to a fork or
without hyper threading performed more
or less the same with the same average
frame rate hovering around 80 glorious
frames per second it's only when we drop
down to a dual-core with hyper-threading
something like a core i3 that we start
to see a noticeable drop-off and a dual
core without hyper threading cut our
frames by over 50% so the bottom line
here is that any relatively decent and
recent Core i5 with 4 physical cores
should be just fine
we also took a look at the effects of
different amounts of system Ram EA
officially requires 8 gigabytes and
recommends 16 but in our testing with a
Titan X and stuff to remove bottlenecks
the game didn't seem to care whatsoever
even when we ran just four gigs of ram
so yeah don't sweat it however if you
don't have a ton of memory you may want
to be careful about how many
applications and browser tabs you have
going on in the background and on the
subject of memory should be pretty
textures in battlefield 1 compel you to
go for a card with more than the
standard ration of 4 gigabytes to find
out we took 2 R X 480 s1 with 4
gigabytes of vram and one with 8 again
even on 4k ultra there was
any real difference between them even
when we disabled the in-game vram
limiter so we can't imagine that 12 gigs
of VRAM would be beneficial unless
you're running multiple high-resolution
screens or ei poles modding support out
of their butts
we tested current GPUs from both AMD and
NVIDIA but we also tested the older GTX
660 that's the minimum recommended card
from EA so we'll see how well that works
overall the good news is that while
battlefield 1 is a great-looking title
you don't need the best hardware on the
market to run it out of all the cards
that we tested the only one that wasn't
really capable of running battlefield 1
at 4k was the $115 Radeon rx 460
everything else at least broke the 30fps
threshold though you'll want a GTX 1080
or a Titan X if you want 4k at 60fps
however crazy that is if you're more
interested in hitting the 1440p sweet
spot your most cost-effective option
here is the $200 RX 470 which hit 60fps
on Ultra settings and none of our cards
really broke a sweat at 1080p except the
affer mentioned rx 460 which still
managed a solid 45 frames per second at
Ultra if you want to break 60fps you
have to turn the settings down to about
medium which still isn't that bad though
we did get strange artifacting at medium
and low settings on multiple resolution
on multiple cards both from AMD and
NVIDIA so only really use those settings
if you really need to because I don't
know what the heck's going on there
speaking of 1080p there's good news as
long as you're not expecting to play the
game at anything higher than 1080p the
660 which was a very popular card for
years is capable of running it as EA
claims which is good at Ultra settings
we've got 33 FPS though with some
noticeable slowdowns when lots of
explosion and whatnot were happening on
the screen button get down too high got
us up to 40 fps and made the experience
a whole lot better especially during
intense cutscenes so that's where we'd
probably recommend it if you're still
using a gtx 660 especially as that way
you'll avoid the
weird artifacting we got at those lower
presets anyways moving on if you've been
waiting for a breakthrough dx12 game
that really shows off the performance
benefits of the new API you'll have to
keep waiting our AMD cards performed
virtually identical the x12 in dx11
while our Nvidia cards actually got
noticeably worse the silver lining here
is that if you're not rocking DirectX 12
compatible hardware you're not missing
anything
so there you go overall I think EA has
done a pretty good job with battlefield
1 all dx12 things considered though I
wish I could say the same about their
origin DRM which locked us out countless
amounts of times from four different
accounts including one directly from EA
with an EA comm email address what the
hell this took us multiple days to
benchmark compared to normally where it
would just take one little section of
time I also spent multiple sessions of
time working with EA support hence the
EA account that we had to test it with
and our keys came from EA so that we
could do this benchmark I'm like making
these videos for you guys I like the
idea of knowing what hardware I will
need for my games and especially in one
of these situations where it's coded
apparently pretty damn well as it feels
like at least for DirectX 12 where you
have a beautiful game and you don't need
that much hardware for it it would be
nice knowing beforehand that you don't
need to upgrade your graphic setup or
whatever else but then this happens and
it's just like anyways similar to what
happened with Star Wars Battlefront the
frostbite 3 engine delivers impressive
immersive visuals without really pushing
your hardware as I just mentioned all
you really need is any modern mid-range
graphics card and a CPU that is has a
few cores and you'll be fine
battlefield will play the way it was
meant to be no SLI overclocking or
bayonets required just hopefully you're
even allowed to play so we'll see I'm
going to go be salty somewhere else
then we'll just
do the ad spot move on crunchyroll is a
