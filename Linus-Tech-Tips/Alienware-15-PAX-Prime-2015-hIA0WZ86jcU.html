powered by hyperx make sure to check out
their cloud 2 headset in the description
down below also thank you to a sous and
corsair alright guys we're here at the
alienware booth checking out the
alienware 15 now the one on the floor
isn't actually the most recent 15 it
doesn't have a type-c connector so if
you see some kind of funky b-roll i'm
just going to explain now that's why and
here's a processor options this laptop
comes with a fairly lowly i5 or three
different i7s ranging up to a 4870 HQ in
terms of graphics you range from nvidia
from a 965 em to a 9 ATM it also has a
one terabyte hard drive or a 256
gigabyte PCIe SSD plus a one terabyte
hard drive or a 512 gigabyte piece a SSD
and a one terabyte hard drive or a one
terabyte PCIe SSD and a one terabyte
hard drive moving on from there we've
got a killer 1535 wireless networking 8
to 16 gigabytes of 2133 megahertz memory
and an eight cell lithium-ion battery to
cool this unit they have a few heat
pipes going across the CPU and GPU which
move their heat to two rear exhaust fans
one on the left and one of the right
back hand side of the laptop this laptop
as a whole features 10 individual
programmable lighting zones with about
20 different colors that you can choose
from it's a full HD 2 megapixel camera
and the keyboard actually has five
different macro keys on it which you can
set an alienware software also on the
keyboard there's four different zones of
individual multicolored lighting in
terms of i/o there's a three-in-one card
reader a USB type-c connector that
sports tank gigabit per second and
Thunderbolt 3 we also have an rj45
gigabit ethernet jack hdmi 2.0 jack a
locking security connector 3.5
millimeter audio jack alienware
amplifier support now we have paws on
that one for a second the alienware
amplifier is their external graphics
card support blocks so you can actually
see that here it's a fairly large box
that supports a large PCH exi power
supply and a graphics card nvidia or AMD
this allows you to take this newly
refreshed alienware 15
and add a big beefy graphics card to it
yes you might pick the nine ATM model
and match lee be pretty good to go or
you could save some money get the 965
m-model get the amplifier which will
probably make it so you're not really
saving that much money but regardless
have it use less power while you're on
the road and then be able to dock it
when you get home and have a piece
machine with like an actual 980 in it
for a desktop size graphics card and
that's pretty sick thanks again to hyper
extra sending us here this year check
out their youtube channel hyperx gaming
in the top corner up here in the card
section also thank you to a sous and
corsair for sending us here this year do
