interesting i'm in the sun box and
actually going to focus a little bit
less on the product itself and a little
bit more on the heritage of this
particular product so this is the OCC
octane SSD this is a say 236 gigabit per
second SSD Drive which means it's very
modern okay now unlike most of the
modern SSDs out there this does not use
a marvel controller it does not use a
sandforce controller so what does it use
this is one of the few products on the
market that is actually unique and
proprietary and why shouldn't a
proprietary because it complies to
standards like these say the three but
it's actually unique and different and
has a value add that is in some way I'm
separated from what its competitors are
able to do in the marketplace and I'm
going to explain what it has as soon as
I can get this package open no this uses
an in the links controller and you go oh
in the links controller i remember those
but no this is a new window controller
so this uses the all-new inglot in
english in the links everest
architecture which is an updated into
links controller something happened to
into links well they used to make
controllers on their own and they used
to be the kind of top dog it was
indolence vs intel in those days with
you know Jay micron having their
stuttering issues and then they kind of
fell by the wayside when San force
released their sata2 competitor and then
their se23 drive just kind of came out
of nowhere and blue ever absolutely
everything away so ocz acquired them and
they've been quietly working on aceite
36 gigabit per second chipsets
this is the average controller and what
it does is unlike sandforce and one of
the cool things about sandforce this is
what was so revolutionary particularly
about the first and fourth controller
the San force controller compresses the
data as it's being written to the drive
and then decompresses it as it's being
read from the drive so that allows it to
actually read and write more than it's
actually even reading and writing which
means that the performance of the drive
is higher than the actual performance of
the flash which is cool right however
there are limitations to that
architecture so some things that you're
going to have to work with some large
files are not going to be very
compressible this is called non
compressible data when you're working
like a text document is very easy to
compress but not all multimedia type
files in fact there's a lot of files
such as files that are compressed
already if something is zipped already
there's not a whole lot more compression
that can be done so non compressible
files perform significantly worse on a
74 strive than they do on competing
drives so what in the links has achieved
here is they've made a controller that
is focused on non compressible data
which means that no matter what usage
scenario you're looking at it will
perform exactly the same whereas a San
force drive performs better and
compressible and not as well on non
compressible data so hopefully that's
enough information for you guys so how
well did they do basically it is
competitive with Sam force on
compressible data and beats it on non
compressible data so I'd say yes they
achieved their goal very cool it's also
the first SSD that's available in
capacities up to one terabyte on a
single controller which is sort of an
interesting fact but probably irrelevant
to most consumers it uses mlc flash okay
it has trim support it sure as heck
better it has raid support which also
sure as heck better ah here we go
all-around performance and optimized for
compressed files such as mp3s JPEGs raws
PSD's OS x software interesting and
taking multimedia applications to the
next level so they're pretty much that's
a way of saying what I said in a very
long time in like one sentence so way to
go see my ass to see is faster in your
hard drive comes with a cool
little sticker totally standard drive so
it's two and a half inch which means you
got your mounting holes here and here
your mounting holes here and here here
here and here and here you've got your
say 236 gigabit per second interface
here there's your data there's your
power and I think I've said pretty much
everything I wanted to this is the
octane 128 gig and as you go up in
capacity you do actually get more
performance with these octane drives and
thank you for checking out my boxing and
first look at the ocz octane as well as
a little bit of a history lesson I guess
I'll bout the sandforce controller the
indolence controller and how the new
generations of products stack up don't
