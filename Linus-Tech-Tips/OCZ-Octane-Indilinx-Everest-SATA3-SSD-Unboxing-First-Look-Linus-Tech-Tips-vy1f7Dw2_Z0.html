interesting and I'm in the Sun box and
actually going to focus a little bit
less on the product itself and a little
bit more on the heritage of this
particular product so this is the OCC
octane SSD this is a SATA 3 six gigabit
per second SSD drive which means it's
very modern okay
now unlike most of the modern SSDs out
there this does not use a Marvella
controller it does not use a sand force
controller so what does it use this is
one of the few products on the market
that is actually unique and proprietary
and why shouldn't a proprietary because
it complies to standards like you know
SATA 3 but it's actually unique and
different and has a value mat that is in
some way separated from what its
competitors are able to do in the
marketplace and I'm going to explain
what it has get this package open no
this uses an in the Lynx controller and
you know o in the Lynx controller I
remember those but no this is a new a
new controller so this uses the all-new
Inglot in English in the Lynx Everest
architecture which is an updated into
Lynx controller something happened to
into Lynx well they used to make
controllers on their own and they used
to be the kind of top dog it was
indolence versus Intel in those days
with you know J micron having their
stuttering issues and then they kind of
fell by the wayside when sad force
released their SATA to competitor and
then their SATA 3 drive just kind of
came out of nowhere and absolutely
everything away so OCC acquired them and
they've been quietly working on a SATA 3
6 gigabit per second chipset so
this is the average controller and what
it does is unlike SandForce
and one of the cool things about
SandForce this is what was so
revolutionary particularly about the
first time first controller the sad
force controller compresses the data as
it's being written to the drive and then
decompresses it as it's being read from
the drive so that allows it to actually
read and write more than it's actually
even reading and writing which means
that the performance of the drive is
higher than the actual performance of
the flash which is cool right however
there are limitations to that
architecture so some things that you're
gonna have to work with some large files
are not going to be very compressible
this is called non compressible data
when you're working like a text document
is very easy to compress but not all
multimedia type files in fact there's a
lot of files such as files that are
compressed already if something is if
already there's not a whole lot more
compression that can be done so non
compressible files perform significantly
worse on a set force drive than they do
on competing drives so what in the links
has achieved here is they've made a
controller that is focused on non
compressible data which means that no
matter what usage scenario you're
looking at it will perform exactly the
same whereas a SandForce Drive performs
better at compressible and not as well
on non compressible data so hopefully
that's enough information for you guys
so how well did they do basically it is
competitive with Sam force on
compressible data and beats it on non
compressible data so I'd say yes they
achieve their goal very cool it's also
the first SSD that's available in
capacities up to one terabyte on a
single controller which is sort of an
interesting fact but probably you're
relevant to most consumers it uses mlc
flash ok it has trim support it sure as
heck better
it has raid support which also it sure
as heck better ah here we go
all-around performance and optimized for
compressed files such as mp3s JPEGs
Raw's PSD s OS X software interesting
and taking multimedia applications to
the next level so there pretty much
that's a way of saying what I said in a
very long time in like one sentence so
way to go OCZ my SSD is
your hard drive comes with a cool little
sticker totally standard drive so it's
two-and-a-half inch which means you got
your mounting holes here and here your
mounting holes here and here here here
and here and here you've got your SATA 3
6 gigabit per second interface here
there's your data there's your power and
I think I've said pretty much everything
I wanted to this is the octane 128 gig
and as you go up in capacity you do
actually get more performance with these
octane drives and thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the
OCZ octane as well as a little bit of a
history lesson I guess about the Sam
force controller the indolence
controller and how the new generations
of products stack up don't forget to
