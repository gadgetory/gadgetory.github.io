reviewed last year didn't have the
greatest keyboard or a super crisp
high-resolution screen it didn't have
the best battery life and the strength
of its construction was frankly subpar
but it got a very positive review
because I understood the steep learning
curve associated with engineering such a
unique product the world's lightest
15-inch laptop under one kilogram well
now they've had a year to reflect on
their experience and refine the design
so the 2017 iteration of the LG gram
will get no such special treatment let's
see how it fares
the master keys pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below right out of the
gate LG's increased confidence in the
Graham product line is apparent we get
three different screen sizes to choose
from and the variety of configurations
and colors available is wider our
14-inch er is equipped with a dual core
Core i5 7200 u eight gigs of ram and a
256 gig SATA 3 SSD while our 15.6 inch
rocks a core i7 7500 u 16 gigs of ram
and a 512 gig SATA 3 SSD and there have
been some other changes too for one
thing the top-end 15.6 inch model weighs
more than a kilogram now with the 14
inch coming in at almost the same weight
as last year's 15.6 wit what wasn't the
weight the whole point of the gram name
even well maybe but I don't care because
you get a whole lot of awesome stuff for
your 10% weight increase without in my
mind giving up a noticeable amount of
the portability of it first up the lousy
hinge has been replaced by one that's
damn near perfect this is more
impressive than you might think
one finger lift is not easy on a device
that weighs so little next up all three
grams sizes are available with
multi-touch screens now the 1080p IPS
displays still isn't dazzlingly bright
and suffers from worse than usual glare
under non ideal conditions and I think
strengthening it a little bit to reduce
wobble is especially important for
something you're supposed to touch but
I'd still rather have this feature than
not third up the addition of a backlight
on the keyboard whew
I mean I got nothing negative to say
about it it's got two brightness levels
and works as you would expect the
absence of this on last year's model was
one of my main gripes about it along
with number four unexceptional
life which has been well let's just say
the battery got more roided-up than 90s
major league baseball all three models
thirteen fourteen and fifteen point six
inch gets 60 watt our batteries that's
about eighty-five percent of the
capacity that powers a thin enlight
gaming notebook like the razor blade for
three to four hours except that by
comparison the gramm sips power LG did
this cool video showcasing a sponsored
art collab that was created on a single
charge on the grand and that was neat
but to put it in a more practical
everyday perspective i forgot my laptop
charger at the office on friday used it
as I normally would over the weekend
and still had 30% left when I got into
the office on Monday morning the last
machine I had that freed me from
worrying about the location of the
nearest wall outlet like that was the
2015 MacBook and unlike that thing the
Graham has ports though while the USB C
port can be used for 4k 60 Hertz output
and I'm pretty darn thankful for the
micro SD and type a USB 3s I do think
that the loadout could have been better
Thunderbolt 3 and hdmi 2.0 would be
welcome additions on the next model and
IMO charging should really be handled by
another type C port and while I'm at it
the speaker sound like they're coming
from somewhere under my desk probably
because that's where they're pointed the
webcam location not to mention the image
quality sucks the big one I'd like to
see it moved above the display even if
it costs me a few grams and while the
click pad actually feels pretty decent
in day-to-day use objectively it really
needs to be better built on a device
that costs this much with that said the
2x2 Wi-Fi implementation is a solid B -
managing over 30 megabytes per second in
my standard test location and the
keyboard wins back a lot of the points I
just deducted there are a couple
lay out oddities I'm not a huge fan of
the power button here instead of delete
but the key switches are surprisingly
satisfying to type on and there's a
pleasant soft touch coating on the key
caps which add up to an overall really
enjoyable typing experience and this is
critical for a hyper portable machine
like this because even though the simple
cooling solution kept everything under
control at reasonable noise levels even
with no thermal throttling these you
class dual cores aren't beefy enough to
do much more than sit and work on them
they just do it for a really really
really long time in the LG Graham got a
point you need to make but not the right
image to illustrate it well you can find
the perfect asset for your next creative
project with Adobe stock they've got
millions of images graphics and videos
that are built right into Photoshop
Illustrator and other apps making it so
you can spend your time designing
instead of searching for images that you
have the rights to use you can preview
water marked images inside your designs
then license access and manage them
within your Adobe desktop apps you can
pay as you go or you can save by signing
up for a subscription plan if you sign
up today you get 10 free images as part
of their trial so check it out over at
soft cat through the link below thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but who's awesome
get subscribed hit the like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured look at this I got
another one back here oh but wait
