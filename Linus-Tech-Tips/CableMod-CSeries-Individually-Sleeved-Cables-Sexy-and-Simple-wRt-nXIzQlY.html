again will he be slamming them for being
snake oil will he be pretending they
give him special powers will he be
climbing over the roof of his garage no
none of those things today is just a
straight-up video on some straight-up
replacement modular cables for your PC
power supply the C series from cable mod
save on select intel core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more so my initial
discussion with the cable wad guys was
pretty straightforward they asked if I'd
review their cables I said yeah sure
they look interesting they asked what
color I'd like and I said all of them
and they were like what and so I
repeated myself I would like all of them
and they were like look we're not gonna
we're not sending you enough to equip
you and all your friends with a set of
cable I mean someone has to actually buy
these things at some point I was like no
I plan to horde them all for myself
then there was kind of silence on the
other end of the phone line for the
while followed by Lego what could you
possibly need 12 different color sets of
cables for and while I argued valiantly
for the necessity of having them all on
hand just in case I was in the mood to
change my color scheme at some point in
the future it was in vain they did send
me all of the colors to show you guys
but I only got full sets of a few of
them and just one of each of the rest so
what in the devil are these dead-ball
it's been fashionable for quite some
time and we have a local Vancouver
gentleman who goes by the name of
Charles to mostly thank for the
popularization of this to individually
sleeve each wire in a 24 pin 8 pin 6 pin
or our mini pin cable for aesthetics and
it's a purely aesthetic play by the way
since it actually makes the wires
bulkier from an airflow perspective
compared to having them on their own or
bundling them together with a single
sleeve the problem with individual
sleeving is that it's extremely
expensive and time-consuming to source
the quality materials and tools that you
need to do it then actually do it
seriously it takes a long time so for
most people who aren't going to make
custom cables and just want to sleeve
the standard ones that would normally be
included with their power supply an
aftermarket prepackaged solution is a
nice little time saver although this
isn't the first such product NZXT x'
approached early on in this trend was to
offer extensions for any power supply
cable these had the benefit of excellent
compatibility but the drawback of
additional resistance on every wire
and they required the user to find
somewhere to tuck away and hide the rest
of what was otherwise already a
full-length cable course there actually
provides pre individually sleeved cable
kits for some of their fully modular
power supplies but thus leaving they use
isn't that great and it's only available
in a few different colors although on
the other side of the spectrum there are
some custom shops online that you can
order made to order cables from but not
everyone is comfortable with that and
although the selection is unlimited they
can get very expensive so cable mods
tries to bridge the gap I guess they use
paracord types leaving that they brand
as mod flex which means it's extremely
flexible it's softer and imo nicer
looking than the traditional sleeping
materials and it doesn't allow any of
the color of the wire to be seen through
it it's actually very similar to what
silverstone uses on the cables on this
power supply that i declared to be the
best I'd ever seen for modular cables a
couple of years ago but they don't have
the same cost associated with them that
a custom one does another nice touch
actually is that they don't use any heat
shrink you know that kind of plastic
stuff on the end of every sleeve that
holds it in place this gives every wire
an extremely clean look as it goes into
the connector or at least all of that is
all the stuff that cable mod claims on
their website I wouldn't be much of a
reviewer if I didn't spend some time
validating all of this so I took my C
series cables which means I had to use
of course their ax i HX i or RM series
power supply and I built myself a little
system here they do have the right pin
notes available for all their popular
power supplies from Corsair EDG a and C
sonic and apparently more colors coming
but this is what we've got for now so as
advertised the cables plug into the
things and make your system look
subjectively better if I had to come up
with a complaint it would be that not
enough ponies galloped past me while I
was building the system with the cable
mod cables that would be a massive
improvement which leads us pretty well
into the conclusion that practically
writes itself if you're into hot rodding
your PC and having it look all you know
shweet and you don't feel like sleeping
your cables yourself something that some
people are into but most fine tedious
and bothersome then cable Maude delivers
the goods enthusiast great individually
sleeved cables and I guess that pretty
much it
speaking of enthusiast grade parts
