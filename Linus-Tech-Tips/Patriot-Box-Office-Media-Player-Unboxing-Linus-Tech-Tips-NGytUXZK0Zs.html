with one of these media extender devices
these days and we have a really
intriguing one today from patreon it's
called the box office and I'm gonna have
the cameraman have a look at the side
but I'll give you a couple key specs of
this guy right off the bat first of all
you've got our MVB support just like the
asou so play and it is using the same
chipset if you want to check out my
unboxing on the O play you should click
the link okay so other features that is
got it has network support but and let's
start getting this thing open here
you've also got support much like the
popcorn our to put a drive inside so you
can actually open up the unit itself and
pop in a two and a half inch drive so
that means that you can store media on
it you can store media on a USB device
and plug it in or you can store media
over the network and play it that way
now this is a pre-production sample so
it's not gonna be perfect in terms of
the retail packaging and I've been
informed that they actually may be
changing the finish on the top to more
like a matte finish instead of a brushed
finish but let's have a look at the unit
itself anyway so I want to compare it
quickly in size to the WD TV so it's a
little bit bigger it's a little bit
wider but it's about the same height and
it's kind of don't for all I'd say
similar in size once you put it on your
shelf so at the front we've got the USB
port we've got the IR receiver for the
remote which is actually really
impressive more on that later then we've
got a USB and hard drive signaling
lights power and the land signal this is
a full HD device so it supports 1080
that means MKV all that good stuff but
you should probably have a look at the
side of the box you can just pause and
read that if you so desire okay so on
the back we have I'm assuming these are
composite but until I get this off I
won't know for sure yes we have
composite video output and audio then we
have optical audio out
we've got HDMI supporting 5.1 or 7.1
audio we've actually got a power switch
and a lot of these devices don't have a
power switch if you want to turn it off
you have to just unplug it here is a USB
plug now this is different from a normal
USB plug in that you can actually use
this device as an external
two-and-a-half inch hard drive so that
means you don't actually even have to
have and that we're
attachment to it you throw the hard
drive inside you plug into here and then
you can just drag-and-drop files from
your desktop on to the hard drive inside
now this one is for an external hard
drive that plugs in that you would put
next to the unit this is a ten hundred
LAN port and then you've got your power
port so you know what let's let's really
quickly take out the take off the cover
here and I'm gonna show you exactly how
the hard drive goes inside now I haven't
seen this yet so this may be a bit of a
surprise for me also this is a pic quick
screwdriver if you want to see my
unboxing for it click the link yeah
that's right you can watch other videos
of me unboxing stuff as well so let's
see how this works oh there we go that
was easy
so here is the inside of the unit so
first of all we've got what appears to
be a 40 millimeter cooling fan so that's
gonna be cooling the chipset which is
underneath there as well as some of the
power delivery circuitry we can see you
can see at the front we've got our our
infrared thingamajiggy we've got our USB
and then there's all of our indicator
lights here you can see we've got what
is that so that's some kind of that's
must be the power input right there no
no it's not what is that well I'm not
gonna guess here's the power switch
though so there you go there's the
wiring for that and then here is your
SATA interface so this accepts a SATA
2.5 inch drive and you just put force no
two screws on the sides one here and one
here and then you seal it right back up
it's just 2 screws to pop the unit open
that is pretty cool ok so now let's have
a look at the accessory package that
comes with this media player pull the
box out here
alright so seseri package first of all
you'll notice it comes with a six foot
HDMI cable that's a pretty good add-on
actually I like to see that because a
lot of these devices are only coming
with composite and component cables
speaking of composite there it is you've
got a composite cable as well then you
have a USB cable so this is the one that
you're gonna need it's USB eight a mini
beep that's what you need to just plug
it into your computer and drag and drop
files now you've got some batteries they
are ignite hopefully they don't ignite
you know it's not very funny actually
then you've got a power brick okay
pretty straightforward and that brings
us to the remote actually this remote is
very impressive compared to some of the
other remotes we've seen in a similar
price point so you've got full number
pad you got your power switch home
button apparently patriots actually done
a lot of work on the firmware with this
device compared to sort of the stock
units you can buy you've got all of your
volume control pause play all that kind
of stuff you can navigate the menus here
and then you've actually got a bunch of
really cool stuff down here instant
replay repeat angle copy so that's I'm
not a hundred percent sure what that's
for but either way it looks like a
pretty fully featured Ramon I'm really
glad to see that especially on such a
low cost device next we've got screws so
these are for attaching the hard drive
and then finally at the bottom we find
the quick installation guide so that
basically shows you ok so it starts on
the backside ok so first of all you got
your package contents which we already
saw we've got the device layout which
we've already seen and then it basically
shows you connect the media player to
your TV initiate the media player ok and
then plug in the USB external hard drive
or flash drive to the media player ok it
must be pretty simple to set up or I'm
thinking they would have a more detailed
QuickStart guide so there's your full
user manual you can always throw that in
your computer if you're having trouble
thank you for checking out my video blog
