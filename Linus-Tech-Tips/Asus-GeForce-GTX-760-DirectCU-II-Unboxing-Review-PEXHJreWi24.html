Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more now i've heard a whole lot of
claims about non-reference cards running
cooler and overclocking better and but
this time prior to doing the unboxing
this is not the first time we've taken
this card out of the box we have
validated it so this right here is the
Asus GTX 760 direct cu2o C and if that
name wasn't long enough for you then I
can put some other stuff in there to Gig
direct power a superalloy power windows
8 ready 20% cooler vastly quieter huh
what is it all amount to let's go ahead
and open up the card so you go inside
you find a dual PCIe 6 pin 2 PCIe
8 pin adapter and you find a graphics
card you also find a speed setup which i
think is their way of saying Quick Start
Guide also throw me away download the
drivers off of the Asus website or
better yet off of the Nvidia website and
yeah actually NVIDIA website and then
get like all the cool utilities and
stuff that you need off of the assist
website so let's check out this card so
there's the usual Asus advantages so
they've redesigned the cooler as well as
the PCB so physically custom PCB so
they're using their SAP superalloy power
MOSFETs 5k rated caps as well as alloy
based inductors they're using their new
direct power feature I'm gonna go ahead
and turn this over so you guys can read
that right side up and this basically
acts like a powered superhighways I
think the way that they described it in
their literature but I'm going to
explain it in a way that might be a
little bit more meaningful think about
this when you have a super thin
extension cord and you try to run
something like a space heater off of it
what happens the cord gets hot that's
bad that's terrible actually whereas
when you have a nice thick power cord
the resistance of that cord to the
electricity flowing in it is less
therefore it stays cool even with high
draw components on the other side that
my friends is what direct power is
so instead of relying on simply the
traces inside the PCB themselves to
transfer power to the GPU and from the
GPU this direct power feature goes no
parity or around that and it provides
well that okay it's a power superhighway
fine so we go back to a Seuss's way of
describing it so reduces impedance and
reduces GPU temperatures both of these
are good things the direct co2 cooler
uses direct contact copper heat pipes
there are four nickel plated copper heat
pipes two of which are thick style heat
pipes going out to the outer parts of
the aluminum heatsink fin stack and then
two of them are thinner heat pipes that
are going out to the well the aluminum
heatsink fins stack and it's also got to
a specially tuned dustproof fans so
tuned fans basically means they have the
right static pressure to airflow ratio
and dustproof means they are double
sealed so that you're not going to have
dust buildup getting inside the bearings
itself reducing the lifespan ease whose
figures these are good for about an
extra 10,000 hours of lifetime versus a
standard fan you've also got a MOSFET
vrm heatsink which hopefully I can find
somewhere in there yes I can I'm
actually just going to have to take the
PCB off we'll do a b-roll shot of that
but don't worry too much about it
basically better cooling for the hottest
part of the card now in terms of raw
specs like all geforce gtx 760 s it uses
a GK 104 course lightly overclocked so
one point zero zero six gigahertz base
clock and then 1071 megahertz boost
clock it's got two gigs of gddr5 at 6
gigahertz so eight pieces four on the
back four on the front presumably yep
they're on there 256-bit memory bus just
like all other 760 s PCI Express 3.0
interface to SLI fingers for up to three
Way SLI and on the back four connectors
to dual link DVI one HDMI em one
DisplayPort giving you full support for
Nvidia 3d vision surround off of a
single card of course with gaming cases
being as windowed as they are these days
if the card didn't look good you
probably wouldn't even be considering it
and the good news is that it does it's
got a nice shroud plastic shroud mind
you with a matte black overall theme
with some glossy black as well as glossy
red
I personally think the directs YouTube
cards um
I personally think they look great they
look very functional to me whereas you
have fancier cards out there like for
example a reference gtx 770 is very very
fancy but this will actually keep the
card running cooler which because it
supports GPU boost 2.0 is important
because the cooler the card runs the
more often it will be running in its
boost state I also really like the way
that Asus has done the penis extent I
mean PCB extension on the back of the
card many of these modern cards have
little like plastic extender pieces not
only sue says we're gonna do a metal
extension it's going to have aluminum
heatsink fins and it's going to not look
cheesy even though the card itself is
quite small and quite compact this
extension is for functional reasons and
the reason is that while you need to fit
lots of cooling on the card even though
it's a small PCB so this allows them to
have the fan not just be hanging off
into the middle of nowhere one unique
thing about this card is it uses a
single 8 pin PCI Express power connector
first time I've seen this and I've
always I've wondered for a long time why
we continued to see mid power cards with
dual six pins as opposed to a single
eight pin and I guess Asus sort of was
asking themselves the same thing because
that is done software wise make sure you
grab GPU tweak it's specifically
designed for Asus cards allows you to
use all the functionality in terms of
overclocking that you can and don't
forget guys that with their GPU hot wire
that's what it's called and supported
asu's motherboards you can actually
directly over volt the GPU in ways that
are technically not really allowed by
Nvidia but I see I don't even think how
I would think they talked about it
that's the funny thing about it so
certain certain boards particularly
there are og boards do support that
feature yeah they're not even talking
about it it's like well no you know you
can do it but we're just going to keep
it very quiet and right so let's get
down to performance overclocking is
always in theory better on these
non-reference cards but in our
experience this card did overclock
better than our reference card so we
only ran a couple of benchmarks just to
show you guys sort of what you can
expect we used our standard graphics
card testing test bench so 30 960 X 4
gigahertz 16 gigs around 128 gig SSD
thousand watt power supply etc etc etc
our stock 760 ran at about 1.1
five gigahertz on the core 3.34 eight
gigahertz on the memory and our directs
you to OC run at 1280 megahertz on the
core much better and 3456
on the RAM very cool so what did this
amount to in the real world well
basically a couple percent performance
improvement so we ran Crysis 3 and I'm
not going to spend too much time on
these slides but we also ran Far Cry 3
and we saw however small remember these
are the same cards running the same
drivers essentially performance
improvements so it costs a couple
percent more than a reference card and
performs a couple percent better I guess
you can't ask for much more than that
thanks for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the geforce gtx 760
directs you to OC from a soos don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for unboxings reviews and other computer
videos let me know what you think of
this card in the comments and guys
please do like the video it helps me out
a whole whack load of a ton it really
does</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
