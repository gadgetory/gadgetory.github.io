frames from Samsung they're not just
photo frames they do have LCDs inside
them we have the SPF 105 P and the SDF 7
1e and it occurred to me when we were
talking about topics for a video that
it's going to be pretty hard for people
to come up with searching for these
terms and I thought you know I can't
even figure out what these names mean
and then it occurred to me SPF is not
sun protection factor it's not even 1 s
if you have exams for I don't actually
know what SPF stands for but either way
we're going to let blocks these LCDs and
show you some of the neat features so
we're going to start with the 7 inch
model let's open this baby up oh yeah
creating open box inventory and I'm
having a fair amount of difficulty with
the sticker there we go
relive your best moments is like a
marketing message right on the inside
here reads it's got a little blue ball
isn't that sweet so then we take this
off and you've got your instruction
manual which is in both English and
French Thank You kbecque and then we've
got some warranty stuff and right inside
you will find that the 7 inch digital
photo frame now just move that aside for
now next inside you've got the oh wow
this is complicated okay you've got a
power cable you've got a stand which I
will move cuz right now all you can
really see as me managing in the box
we've got a little stand that looks
suspiciously like it
nevermind but guys
and then the other part of power cable
and a USB cable so that is all the
accessories that come with the SP 710
870 okay so physical properties of the
seven-inch LCD photo frame first of all
you've got
besides the 120 Meg's of integrated
memory in the unit itself we've got a
USB slot so we can use that for a USB
thumb drive or we've got an SD slot so
you can put an SD card in so you can
store a lot more than 120 Meg's of
photos and have them display on the
screen now you've also got your controls
on the back a Kensington lock a power
button and here you will find a socket
for this so I will demonstrate the
proper use of this instrument and the
socket first peel back the plastic e
rubbery protective layer then carefully
insert the ball into the socket yeah
there we go
okay and then see that's not very well
protected at all is it but what are you
gonna do so that is your stand and that
is how the device will stay held up when
you put it on the shelf so as the
cameraman pointed out the likelihood of
the contents of this box being very
similar to the other one is very high so
we are going to do a speed unboxing here
okay protective thing ah driver CD that
was not in the other one the cameraman
is clearly wrong you do not contain the
same thing manual warranty and a 10 inch
photo frame not that the number of
inches is necessarily the most important
thing no and this one also has kind of a
cool if I can get the camera to zoom in
it has kind of a neat swirly pattern to
the frame which I think looks pretty
stylin if you can see that in our shot
not really sure either way let's move on
to what else is in the book so we've got
a stand for the back and this is an
entry
shake device I wonder what this could be
used for we'll get on to that later and
then we have power in USB so it is for
the most part the same things inside so
let's move on to showing you what they
look like first of all we show you all
of the inputs on the 10 inch model so
we've got compact flash right here then
we have right there yeah okay
then we got USB 4 USB thumb drive USB
for loading things onto the internal
memory and an SD card now you will also
see an input port at the back and that
is for this thing there we go
oh I broke it hold on okay
that's a little tricky bit of a tight
squeeze there there we go so that way we
can have the 10 inch one standing on its
own so first thing once you've wiped the
fingerprints off that you've inevitably
got on them while you were unpacking
them it's time to turn on your new
digital photo frame so we will have that
experience together right now
aha a lovely couple and a nice looking
Asian family and there's there's the
family again some people in the bath
excellent as you can see the 10 inch one
actually has a feature where it is
playing music in the background I'm not
sure if the camera can hear that or not
but it's it's nice enough but I think it
would get pretty old so we'll
investigate a little bit further into
putting our own pictures on and maybe
even our own music so I just wanted to
briefly cover the viewing angle the
viewing angle on these is a lot better
than what picture frame photo picture
digital picture frames were about a year
ago when I bought one so you can see the
picture perfectly clearly at an angle of
about like this so if you were to mount
this on the wall or put it up on the
mantel or whatever else you'd be able to
see it from a good part of the room
unlike older digital photo frames but
that pretty much concludes the 7 inch
model let's grab some controls on the
back that's a pretty basic thing so
we're going to move onto some of the
neat features of the 10 inch model okay
so we plug in our USB thumb drive and
we'll use what is a very cool feature
that this has which is touch sensitive
controls right here which are actually
proving to be kind of a pain but the
idea behind something like this is that
you wouldn't necessarily be using it
very often so USB gets connected so we
click photo enter there we go so the the
cameraman grab some pictures that he
thought were pretty tremendous from my
last vacation and so we've got a new
slideshow with the the pictures that
he's chosen apparently most of these
pictures involve me thinking that men
are interesting and good ah women are
scary all right so um moving on I'll be
cameraman one and we'll cover how to put
music to go along with your photos okay
so we just connected the USB drive with
the music on it and hold this up here so
we navigate over to music select it I
have to say though the the the menus on
this digital photo frame earthquake
unintuitive at times I'm not really sure
which of these songs to actually select
here so we'll go with this one
okay so at any rate um now we'll try to
play a slideshow which I can't figure
out how to use this thing I'm going to
be a hundred percent honest with you
right now
I find the menu system very unintuitive
and I find these touch controls are
essentially useless because half the
time they don't register and the stroke
and the other half the time you feel
like you're just basically putting a
bunch of smudgy fingerprints it's like
licking one side of the frame and hoping
that it's you know all going to look
nice it's all I'm not I don't like it
very much I suspect once you get it set
up it's terrific so we're just going to
do that off camera and then we'll show
you the product so we're going to wrap
this up this has been kind of a long and
drawn-out episode of my blog basically
um once we got it working I have the
clock enabled on here and it has an
alarm clock feature along with it you
can set any number of different
transitions we've got it set to random
right now you can set which background
music you want to use I mean here's a
couple things that I was not impressed
with as far as limitations go with the
product you can't use anything other
than JPEG as far as we can tell for the
photo format and also mp3 was the only
sound format that we were able to get
working so all in all I'd say I'm pretty
happy with the product the image quality
is stellar it has a better viewing angle
than the 7-inch model obviously on the
10-inch screen it has a very high
resolution at 1024 by 600 um for the
longest time we can figure out how to
adjust the volume of the background
music but we did figure that out it's
something to do with using the up and
down arrows which honestly if it was
documented a little better then it would
be fine it took me about you know 5-10
minutes to sit down with it get it
working exactly the way I wanted it
once it's sitting on the mantel then it
operates as advertised and honestly it's
a really cool little product thanks for
