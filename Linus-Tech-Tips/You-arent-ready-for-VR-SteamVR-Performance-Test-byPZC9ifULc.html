survey upon the world they've given a
way for us hardware enthusiasts to weigh
and measure ourselves to see if we are
actually worthy of VR and it's left some
of us kind of wanting how it runs this
test as it does the portal VR demo where
it just expands a little machine and you
have to try to look at it and what not
but just has a static camera that moves
around when it's done it will serve you
your results whether or not you are
ready capable or not ready
Tunnel bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets use the web as if
you're in 20 different countries learn
more and try to bear for free at the
link in the video description so yeah
it's spoiler alert not that good-looking
only nine point four percent of people
have actually made it through if you
look down below that it will tell you
the results the results will tell you
how to upgrade your system in order to
become ready if you expand lower than
that it will tell you how many frames
were encoded how many frames were above
ninety FPS which is extremely important
considering VR screens are usually
ninety Hertz plus will tell you how many
frames were dropped by your CPU and the
average fidelity of the scene or the
graphical quality that it was able to
accomplish while running through the
entire scene so yeah nine point four
percent of people actually slightly
lower than that already based on the
steam hardware survey so get rekt I
guess we've been saying this for a long
time on Linus tech tips the hardware
community is not actually up there
enough for VR people complain about the
cost of headsets but their computers
aren't even ready but let's take a sec
and actually analyze where those numbers
came from the steam hardware survey is
it up to snuff the steam hardware survey
is a simple but very powerful tool you
submit your data to valve they total it
put percentages of how many people are
running wet on it and make it publicly
available great
tons of people use it we Atlantis Media
Group use it we use it to quantify how
many people are going for what card what
chip what brand whatever and then
discuss that in videos or the LAN show
from time to time it's a pretty
interesting concept and I we will
continue to do that in the future
another group of people that uses it
game devs they use it to target what
hardware they need to prepare their game
for is it a very high end very high
fidelity game while they probably need
to target whatever the highest
percentage of high end cards are that
kind of makes sense it's a relatively
simple concept but does it make sense
for VR does the hardware survey actually
apply properly to VR I would argue no
because there's too much garbage
data what is garbage data well I for one
fall in this category I have probably
about seven computers in the steam
hardware survey but probably one of them
actually exactly one of them is only
intended for VR none of the other ones
will ever probably do anything in the VR
space they're there to play stuff like
papers please or minecraft or
counter-strike or Team Fortress and
those rigs should not be in a percentage
system in order to figure out the amount
of computer is ready for VR I understand
that's not what the steam hardware
survey is but that's where the 9.4% came
from and people have been saying for a
long time including me that the
community isn't ready to get an accurate
representation of the gaming communities
readiness for VR you need a lot of data
to get a lot of this data you need a lot
of people and you need a lot of hardware
I'm only one man so I don't fix that
category but I do have a bunch of
hardware there's a problem there as well
though I have a bunch of bleeding-edge
current generation hardware I don't have
the interesting bits like the i-5 2500
in the GTX 680 which sold a bunch and
might actually still be able to skim buy
into that ready category that's
interesting I want to figure out what is
just going to be able to make it here we
specialize in things like $30,000
computers and computers that fit into
bombs they're fun but they're don't
really matter a ton in this data set I
don't need to reaffirm that really
expensive really over built modern
current generation gaming hardware is
able to run VR we get that it's the more
interesting data that I'm looking for
this is where you come in we need the
community to come together and make a
massively collaborative benchmarking
project so we can see where the
enthusiasts community is sitting in
terms of VR performance we can do this
on the forum the line effective
community forum jumper one one eight has
already done something similar with
Cinebench he has an awesome thread with
over 500 submissions of people Cinebench
scores that's super cool I've used those
results in videos in the past before and
I'm not looking to sell this data before
anyone in the comments freaks out this
is all publicly available stuff we're
not selling it
I'm just one
- active calm form because it's easy so
yeah please submit your test results
there we can see how our community is
ready for VR because I'm pretty sure
it's higher than nine point four percent
so don't worry if you have a low-end rig
if you're running multiple cards
whatever it happens to be if you're
remotely interested in VR or high-end
gaming at all submit your rig and let's
figure it out crunchyroll is a site
