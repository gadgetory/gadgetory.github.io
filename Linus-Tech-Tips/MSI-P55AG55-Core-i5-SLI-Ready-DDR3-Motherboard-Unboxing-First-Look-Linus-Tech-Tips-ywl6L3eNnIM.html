refresh motherboard from MSI so this is
the p55 a
g55 it's going to be very similar to
their previous p55 boards except for a
couple of things first of all you've got
support for SATA 6 gigabits per second
and second of all you've got support for
USB 3 this also features their military
class concept which means you've got top
quality components including IC chokes
and solid caps so IC chokes MSI cleans
run it up to 20 degrees lower than
regular chokes and they're solid caps
they claim has a minimum of a 10-year
lifetime so gives you a long lifetime
low-temperature which we've covered
already as well as high stability and
better overclocking let's get this board
opened right up and have a look at what
we find inside we've got a drivers and
utilities DVD we've got a user's guide
for their hard drive backup software
we've got a quick installation guide
their users guide for MSI winkie
software control center so this is their
software for system monitoring
overclocking and power saving gives you
a quick guide on how to use it full
color and everything look at that I love
seeing full color manuals and pamphlets
it's just it's that those extra little
touches here's their full user guide
which is in a number of languages
English Deutsche Bahn say I don't know
how to pronounce Russian okay for the
back which clearly labels your USB 3.0
ports 0.01 SATA cable molex to SATA
power adapter and an IDE cable that
isn't odd-odd loads of accessories I
would have expected to see maybe like
four SATA cables and then no molex to
SATA power adapter and no IDE cable that
might have made a little bit more sense
I've actually talked to a Maasai about
that and they're looking at improving
their there their bundles or a future
motherboards so yeah how about that okay
let's have a look at the board itself
the board itself is awesome looking okay
really hold on I should go back to this
kind of thing realistically if you're
anything like me look at this you've got
a
of SATA cables lying around it doesn't
really matter here that I can find more
just in this room mom what do we got in
here yep video cards we got some video
cards got some SSDs are you know two
more SATA cables that was hard anyway
yeah
SATA cables are not a big deal but if
you if it includes them then great
alright so let's have a look at the
board layout first of all you got your
eight pin power connector and it's ideal
location up on the top left-hand edge of
the board you've got nice little
heatsink on your voltage regulators down
here you've got active phase between
power savings so what this does is it
determines how many cpu how many phases
of the power delivery system the CP is
actually look using and when the CPU is
under heavier load it will enable more
of them for more stable power and when
the CPU is under light load it'll
actually disable some for some power
savings so that's pretty cool feature
here's your LGA 1156 socket this is a
load socket so you can be assured that
it will make good contact with the pins
between the motherboard and the pads on
the bottom of the CPU next we have dual
channel ddr3 memory support up to 16
gigs presumably you've got a 24 pin
power connector on the right-hand edge
of the board exactly where it belongs
now in terms of things that you can plug
into this board we've got 6 SATA 2 and
these are actually in a fairly good
layout I saw these ones here and I kind
of went that might be bad but it's ok
because even if you've got a dual slot
graphics card here it's only gonna cover
up to about here which is where they're
using the right angle connectors and if
you need to use these you definitely can
even with a card installed here and a
card installed there so that should be
fine and then once again they've got the
2 SATA 6 gigabits per second ports also
coming right out of the board and that
shouldn't be a problem either because
the second dual slaw graphics card would
go here and it would be well out of the
way of that as well
here's your IDE port that's a right
angle port because that would be in the
way of a topic of a bottom graphics card
and then what else do we have on here
we've got a couple of OC switches we've
got their clear CMOS jumper then we have
a power switch which is great if you're
benching this board on an open test
bench we've got 2 front USB headers
we've got our
panel connectors so that's for your
power switch LEDs all that good stuff
and then we've also got a floppy
connector just in case you still need
one of those the audio connector is down
at the very bottom left of the board
near the audio chipset which is right
here it's a real tech chipset now in
terms of expansion this is one of the
things I really like about the way MSI
engineers their boards instead of
leaving a spot here like many other
manufacturers do and installing only six
can and only installing only six
expansion slots on their motherboards
MSI actually puts the extra work into it
does the routing that's necessary to
make sure that they can put a slot right
at the top and that means that you can
install up to seven expansion cards
because really nobody installs seven
expansion cards very few people but if
you're installing two dual slot graphics
cards that leaves you with one two three
if you only have six that leaves you
with only two and lots of people want to
install three expansion cards besides
their graphics versus two so there you
go
that is why I'm such a big fan of the
way MSI does their boards with seven
expansion slots versus only six on many
of their competitors here's the p55
chipset that is running this particular
board and then let's move around to the
backward we will see all of our input
and output on the back panel so we have
optical audio out in a location that
I've never seen it before but I think
the reason they've done this is it
leaves way more room for tons of USB
ports we have a ps2 combo port 8 USB 2.0
ports two USB 3.0 ports one Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio out thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the p55 a
g55 motherboard from msi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
