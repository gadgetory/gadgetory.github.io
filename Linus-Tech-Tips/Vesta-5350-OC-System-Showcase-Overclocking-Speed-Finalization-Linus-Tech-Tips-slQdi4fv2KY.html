so and we have the Vesta 5350 OCR
validated at its factory overclock so
we're actually going to be taking the
2500 K processor that's included with
the system and clocking it at 4
gigahertz out of the box for your high
performance computing pleasure now you
can also see here that our Maxie PU
temperatures in our lab at that at that
frequency are just over 60 degrees and
this is with 4 instances of prime95
running with small FFTs and it's
actually been running up no I'm not sure
how long it's been running let's find
out how long crazy Russian has had it on
the bench and for some reason he's still
pointing over there and now he's
pointing at me my mind is blown okay
let's stop the workers and we see it's
been running for fifteen hours and four
minutes that is a validated overclock so
now let's have a look at what this
system looks like once it gets installed
in the case so because we're using the
define r3 all the cable management
features are here for our youth so all
the power supply cables are able to be
tucked away quite tightly same with the
SATA cables the PCI Express cable is the
24 pin and even the 8 pin power
connector for the motherboard you can
see now that it's not on the test bench
test bench test bench we've got the eco
water cooling system installed and is
using the rear 120 millimeter exhaust on
the case in order to take that heat from
the CPU and blast it right out of this
being used for exhaust right yes and
blast that that hot air right out of the
case so the other components are not
going to suffer and they're cooling
because of it we've got our GTX 560
which is actually the loudest thing in
the system this thing is really really
quiet you probably can't even hear it on
the camera because it's incredibly quiet
the Eco fan is very very quiet the pump
is quiet and see sonic power supplies
are pretty much all quiet so then all
we're left with is the front cooling fan
which is taking care of our one terabyte
boot drive
- WD blue as well as our 40-gig Intel
320 series SSD for caching I'll just
show you guys at the front of the case
if you're not already familiar with the
define our three can see we've got two
five and a quarter inch base for optical
expansion we've got to front one hundred
and twenty millimeter fan slots only one
of them is populated by default to cool
those those drives the other one you
could populate down the road if you
wanted to and it does have the mod you
vent cooling system so that means you
can actually take out these covers here
and install up to an additional two 120
or 140 millimeter fans in the top and
you can actually remove the mod you've
emphasized and install an additional 120
millimeter or rather or 140 millimeter
fan on the side as well so if you were
going to do something like go with an
SLI graphics or if you were going to not
use the kool-aid eco and you were gonna
use an air-cooled heat sink you might
want to install some additional cooling
in order to make sure your system is
performing up to par and I think that's
pretty much it so I just wanted to show
you guys what we were able to talk about
that what we were able to do in the lab
with the best stuff 5350 OC and the
overclock we've achieved oh yeah but one
thing I didn't mention in this video is
that we are running eight gigs of mush
can spillover line ram in here thanks
