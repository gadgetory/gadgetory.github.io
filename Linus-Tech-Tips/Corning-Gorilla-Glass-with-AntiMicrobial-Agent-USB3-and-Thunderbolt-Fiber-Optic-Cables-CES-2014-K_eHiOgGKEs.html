brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital welcome to the Corning
booth where we are going to be having my
lovely assistant show me just how dirty
my phone is with is it sorry is it a TPA
meter ATP meter alright so basically
what this does is it looks for any kind
of organic material on the surface of
the glass of my phone and tells me not
necessarily how much of it is dead or
alive but simply how much there is and I
mean at a show like Vegas it's probably
safe to say that some of its alive and
some of it is going to get me sick
because I can already feel a cold coming
on anyway so I'll let you go ahead and
start swabbing the phone while we talk a
little bit about the technology that is
in corning gorilla glass with
antimicrobial agent now this watch right
here in the top left has a regular soda
lime glass which is an inexpensive
alternative to gorilla glass then in the
bottom left we see what happens to that
glass if you add as much antimicrobial
agent as they did to their own glass it
turns yellow which is undesirable from
pretty much any perspective in the
middle we've got corning gorilla glass
at the top for reference and then at the
bottom with an antimicrobial film now
this might be effective but
unfortunately it gives a very hazy
appearance to whatever's behind it in
the top right we've got regular well not
regular it's awesome regular corning
gorilla glass again and then the bottom
we've got that same glass with their
antimicrobial agent and it is just as
transparent and strong and flexible and
all those great things as be four so
something a lot of people don't think
about so we're just having the the test
completed over here is that is that
their phone touches not only their hands
but also their face and all kinds of
crazy things you lend it to someone so
it can be a well I guess we'll find out
basically that chart behind us is a
summary of the people here at the show
who have had their phones tested here at
the booth so they we've had levels of
ATP as low as kind of 11 2 30 and levels
as high as apparently one lady Lichter
phone and got a reading over 2000 not
something Corning or really anyone
recommends but there you have it guys
that's how that's how some people want
to be about it so here we go guys let's
find out just how dirty my phone is
the ATP once the ATP meter finishes
booting up guys we're not going to cut
this because we want you to know that
you know this is you know how how dirty
are not dirty I happen to be in the
meantime let's talk about what the
antimicrobial agent actually does so we
had to cut this here guys because we got
to be very careful what we say this is
the world's first epa-approved
antimicrobial glass but that you know we
there certain words we can't use but
what we can say is you can be comforted
to know that over the duration of the
lifetime of your device whether you have
a high reading or a low rating you can
be comforted to know that the
antimicrobial agent is always working
Thunderbolt to my friends available on
the Mac Pro actually available on some
pc stuff as well is a very very
versatile standard now it's 20 gigabit
per second which means you can connect
all kinds of great stuff including you
know high definition or even greater
than high-definition cameras capture
devices external pci express enclosures
and all kinds of crazy stuff like that
but one of the limitations are
Thunderbolt right now is that
particularly with the copper cables
available on the market distance is a
problem so if you're setting up
something like I'm little mac pro studio
workspace the 3-meter maximum distance
you can be away from the back of the pc
with a copper cable might not be enough
to have an efficient workplace so
corning with their expertise when it
comes to materials is releasing optical
Thunderbolt cables that are capable of
much much thinner form factors as well
as much longer distances they have a 10
meter cable now there's a 30 meter cable
coming very soon that's correct okay and
then they're going to have up to a 60
meter cable coming later this year now
you probably know you know Lori you've
heard somewhere that optimal optical
cables can be very fragile don't worry
about that guys they've got a demo here
where they're taking their optical cable
jamming it into tiny little holes tying
it into knots they've got a laser
pointer on the one end and you can see
that on us aside from the optical signal
still passing through there is no
leakage at any of those not so it still
maintains its integrity if it gets
closed in a drawer closed in a door
closed in a okay I'm not going to say
any other words that rhyme with that the
point is that it will maintain its data
integrity pretty much regardless of what
happens to it but that's not
all guys Thunderbolt needs longer
distance and thinner cables but so does
USB 3 not to be clear this up right here
is not Corning's product okay this is
actually a copper-based active USB 3
extension cable it's a 15 meter cable
it's extremely heavy made of copper and
also very bulky for comparison my
friends this is Corning's USB 3
compatible to be clear guys the USB 3
standard doesn't include anything about
optical cables so they were kind of like
well okay we're big company we can like
engineer a solution here even though
it's not in the spec so Corning is
releasing their optical USB 3 compatible
cables in lengths up to 50 meters and we
can be expecting those later on in the
year you can see they're obviously
thinner obviously lighter and of course
their optical so performance is going to
be obviously better thank you well okay
to be clear guys it'll still be 5
gigabit per second or 10 gigabit per
second or whatever USB 3 ends up
becoming but better in terms of you know
not having signal degradation over
length which is why the copper one is so
bulky there there I clarified that
anyway guys don't miss any of our CES
2013 2014 coverage our trip to the show
this year is powered by NCI XCOM your
source for great technology selection
and service as well as corsair Memory
and western digital huge thanks to those
guys because without them we wouldn't be
able to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
