a piece showcasing their new Lenovo yoga
book it's a thin light Android tablet
with high-end specs including an Intel
Atom processor 64 gigs of storage and
four gigs of RAM and a touch sensitive
haptic keyboard that they called a halo
keyboard which serves two functions when
you want to type a standard keyboard
layout illuminates and you get this
haptic feedback as you type in place
instead of using physical buttons and
when you prefer to take notes draw or
even color the keyboard vanishes
completely and you use a stylus in this
case one with 2048 pressure levels
called the real pen that lets you draw
and even write on paper having it
instantly digitized it's a totally
unique piece of technology and once
again as I was watching my kids break it
in for me I found myself thinking the
world they're growing up in is so
different from the one that I did and
here are nine reasons why
number one when I was little my parents
had to hang on to physical copies of my
let's generously use the term artwork if
they wanted to preserve them for the
benefit of future camellia excuse me odd
generations yeah my dad actually hold it
held on to this for years apparently and
gave it to me as a gift for my 30th
birthday I love my parents but they're a
little weird sometimes and if you've
ever had a kid in preschool you'll know
that this creates some significant
logistical issues though most folks
figure out a solution because it sure
beats admitting that you lost it
modern kids have a multitude of amazing
tools to make life much easier and
eliminate excuses nothing can ever be
lost under the fridge again mostly
number two inviting kids over to play
was a totally different matter I mean
this was considered a legitimate form of
communication you want to come over and
play nowadays no one even blinks when
your 4 year old is texting his group
chat to organize a play date number
three taking pictures his soul much
better now do you know what I would have
given to be able to see in such clear
detail what exactly it was I was
capturing not to mention the instant
gratification and viewfinders being only
an approximate representation of the
framing was the tip of the iceberg so
darn it we kept our photos because by
the time we got them we'd invested so
much into getting them no matter how
blurry or poorly composed they were
number 4 coloring books weren't so
trendy
I mean sure kids liked them but parents
for the most part seems to have other
things on their minds not so today
number 5 and actually not sure who had
it better for this one when I screwed up
at a little league sporting event I lost
the game and I didn't get to go for
pizza after nowadays it seems like
everyone gets a prize regardless of
skill or actual results so I guess
that's pretty cool but my generation
never had to worry about our mistakes
turning us into minor internet
celebrities number 6
when I was little we had stupid fads
that consumed all of our pocket money I
mean come on all you thirty year olds
raise your hand if you didn't boast in
the schoolyard about your new slammer at
some point or another with that said at
least when we bought useless crap at
least we got physical useless crap
though number seven physical isn't
always an advantage this is a big
improvement though I will say that
ragequitting loses a little bit of its
impact number eight the Pokemon
experience was totally different when I
was a kid people would stare at me
walking around catching Pocket Monsters
and go kids today faces buried in their
screens they don't even look where
they're going nowadays hey there's a map
built right into the game totally
different finally number nine when I was
a kid I think it's fair to say that
there was less courage in the world sure
we had the courage to pay twenty dollars
an hour in batteries to pull the wall
plugs out of our boom boxes and even the
courage to play music wirelessly on the
go but we drew the line at headphones no
it would take another 25 years for
someone to have that kind of courage
that is to say 25 plus how ever much
longer it takes so thank you for
