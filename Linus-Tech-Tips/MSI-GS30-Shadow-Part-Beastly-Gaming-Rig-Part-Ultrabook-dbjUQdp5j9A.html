truth is I came into this review
desperately wanting this notebook to be
the one my meal because it promises
something that's never been delivered
before a teaser for the upcoming Yeti
Pro review no we do that all the time no
I'm talking about the full portability
of like an ultra class type form factor
device with the gaming capability of a
desktop and even some upgrade ability to
boot putting it in the tough position
where the only possible results are the
deep satisfaction of a long time desire
being finally fulfilled or the
disappointment that follows when said
desire rips a gigantic fart right in the
middle that kills the whole mood so
which one is it
Oh
you
we'll have to start with a physical tour
of the portable components by itself
because while alone it doesn't redefine
a product category anything it certainly
doesn't justify the price tag by itself
it's a pretty darn fine little notebook
packed into this thin astonishingly
light magnesium aluminium blend chassis
is a core i7 4870 HQ quad-core processor
16 gigs of ram 256 gigs of raid 0 SSD
storage until iris pro 5200 graphics a
really nice 13.3 inch matte finish
IPS 1080p display which only needed to
be touched to be perfect for me and a 47
watt hour battery that lasted for 2
hours and 25 minutes in the PC market
work battery life test on the left of
the unit is a lock ventilation port USB
3.0 and discrete headphone and
microphone jacks a nice touch for a
gaming notebook around the front is this
kind of weird illuminated strip thing
that I personally think looks pretty
cool but I think should be possible to
turn off since the rest of the notebook
is so professional and non gamer looking
by comparison on the right is an SD card
slot another USB 3.0 port an HDMI 1.4 B
port a killer Gigabit Ethernet jack and
a power input for the unremarkable what
reasonably-sized included power brick
the only improvement I'd probably make
to IO would be mini DisplayPort instead
of HDMI and maybe another USB 3 port if
it could be done the keyboard is white
LED backlit with a stiffer than usual
tactile feel to it but reasonable key
travels I rate it ok the layout is solid
with no cardinal sins committed and my
only real complaint is that while
somehow it bothered me less than on the
Dell XPS 13 I reviewed recently you can
watch that here by the way there is a
lot more flex in the deck than I like to
see giving it a mushy feel when you
bottom out your keystrokes improving
this might add some weight to the
chassis but it would make this notebook
feel much more premium under my fingers
while working on it and while MSI's at
it two thousand dollar notebooks need
glass touch pads the XPS 13 taught me
that to flipping the unit over we find
not
lots of vent holes and a metal bottom
plate that reveals unfortunately
downward firing speakers and fortunately
easy access to two sodium slots and the
storage upgrade slots while we've got an
open seems like a good time to show off
the obnoxiously loud cooling solution I
really wish a better job had been done
of this even under light loads this
notebook is not very quiet and the
proprietary interface connector that
sticks out the back and makes the whole
desktop graphics thing possible because
that's right we missed the back of this
notebook where there's another vent and
these plastic flaps that fold back to
plug this baby into a desktop graphics
box now total biscuits initial reaction
to this thing on Twitter is one that I
bet a lot of you share I mean WTF Matt
it's basically the size of a single GPU
gaming desktop anyway so what's the
bleeding point and the point of it is
that this is pretty different from any
other gaming desktop or notebook out
there for someone who wants to buy one
device that they carry around with them
a lot and then normally only use for
lightweight tasks but then can without
actually owning two full computers dock
for the full desktop gaming experience
this is a pretty compelling little piece
because with how little development
there's been in CPU performance of late
and how little is on the roadmap most of
this machine will actually keep up fine
possibly for years to come with only
graphics needing a shot of adrenaline
now and then and that's what this box
does and a bit more - just like a normal
notebook doc you get ample data
connectivity for the right side aisle
over here so next to that 92 millimeter
intake fan is a 4 port USB 3 hub Gigabit
Ethernet and audio jacks that you can
just leave permanently plugged in
there's a power button over here and the
plug for the 450 watt included power
supply that powers everything inside and
the docs notebook so you don't need to
fuss with your power adapter on the
other side but you also get a PCI
Express gen3 16x link and say 2 3 6
gigabit per second so while I could take
you on a full tour of the outside of
this thing that frankly isn't much you
haven't seen already there's an MSI logo
on the mesh front that conceals a
speaker
that's functional if not particularly
immersive since it only comes from one
direction and that's pretty much it
let's take that piece off and find out
all that cool stuff inside ah yes here
it is inside the doc is room for
officially any MSI graphics card you
desire or any reference AMD or Nvidia
design and realistically most other ones
it's not locked down in any way there's
also a power supply the one I mentioned
before a three and a half inch drive
mount so it can be plugged in here then
screwed in here and used for up to eight
terabytes of gain and mass storage on
anything that you don't need with you
when you're on the go and finally the
custom PCB that powers the whole thing
now one little trick I did find was to
flip this fan control switch to low
since it only makes a couple of degrees
difference under load but I would like
to see a more elegant solution next time
around because it is freaking loud on
high and honestly that should be speed
controlled anyway by the system there
needs to be some communication there I
mean while I'm wishing for things with
how big this dock is maybe the option to
have a single PCIe 16x or split 8x8 X
for some other expansion card on the
next revision would be nice and maybe
some smart ducting for a larger 120
millimeter fan so that it forces air
into the laptop docked on top of it so
it doesn't need its own cooling fan to
unleash an unholy whine upon my ears
when I'm gaming which I guess leads us
pretty well into the usage experience
doesn't it it's loud like the CPU fan in
the notebook overpowers the fan in the
dock and the graphics card under load
but with that aside the GS 30 shadow is
simply put King awesome you do have to
shutdown every time you switch graphics
config so here we'll do this live this
is kind of an interesting little demo
here Boop
whenever you want to switch crafters
config so for the first time ever I
actually care about boot up speed and
thankfully it is shockingly fast and
that's not the only thing that's fast
about it I mean the machine
absolutely flies even with the CPU over
90 degrees in some tests it turbos up to
3.5 to 3.6 gigahertz in games which puts
it on par with some pretty
capable desktop CPUs of course you've
got to pay to play with felt a dedicated
graphics card for the dock it's over 2
grand and then you've got to buy one of
those protip for you guys by the way get
a reference card using a rear exhaust
980 at the same clock speed as the MSI
gaming 980 that they sent me resulted in
higher GPU temps by 6 degrees but still
under the throttle point but 5 degree
lower CPU temps thanks to less heat
energy being transferred from the dock
up into the notebook so much more
reasonable CPU temperatures a worthwhile
trade which leads us to the conclusion
the GS 30 shadow from MSI is the first
of its kind I mean yes there are janky
DIY solutions and yes Alienware also has
an external graphics card box that works
with a handful of its notebooks but
MSI's is different to me because they're
the ones that I believe are doing this
the way that I want it done with a
lightweight legitimately super portable
notebook rather than something that's
already a gaming laptop and already has
a gaming graphics card in it but it's
got some first gen growing pains cooling
needs to be quieter standalone battery
life could definitely be better and I'm
sure that MSI can tune the base to be a
bit more compact or offer some
additional functionality but with all of
that said this is a great start and I'm
hyper excited about the future of a
technology that I've been eagerly
awaiting for years now speaking of the
future of Technology today's episode
sponsor ting has just reached a whole
new level of Technology themselves by
beginning to offer their service on a
GSM network meaning that you can use
about 80% of the smart phones on the
market today on the ting network
including the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
so Tim's whole thing is their mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
when you call ting customer support
actually talks to you instead of a robot
you actually get through put through
directly to a person like low in my mind
right now you also pay only for what you
use so the average ting bill is only
about twenty four dollars a month and if
you're stuck in a contract now and want
to switch to ting they'll cover 25% of
your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks but
on a second is it even a good idea to
switch to ting you don't have to figure
that out on your own just go to Linus
teen bomb which is linked in the video
description and try out the savings
calculator you enter a few bills it
tells you if you'd be saving money on
ting and it takes the guesswork out of
it so I think that's pretty much it
thanks you guys for watching thanks to
our sponsor ting like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you thought it
sucked leave a comment if your feelings
