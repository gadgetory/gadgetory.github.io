logged more hours and half-life than in
real life then the words all-in-one PC
will probably make your eyeballs roll
out of your head and straight out the
front door I mean come on fellas
a iOS may be great for your photography
business but clearly other all-in-ones
don't have all you would need if you're
a gamer well blow the dust bunnies off
those baby blues my friends because the
digital storm era is a 34 inch curved
ultra wide AIO with a frickin GT X 1080
inside it
the gmm keyboard features cherry
gatherin and kale hot-swappable switches
with a floating key cap design RGB
lighting and minimalistic style check it
out now at the link below
kicking things off the ARRA is seriously
heavy-duty like all of digital storms
custom machines
it's a low-volume built to order product
which explains why the thin bezel is
anodized aluminum rather than your usual
mass production plastic and also why
some of the finishing touches are
perhaps a little less finished the 34
inch display is mounted on a rugged AF
stand that does offer a generous amount
of tilt freedom but unfortunately only
stays at a fixed height which given the
height disparities found among humans
even just within our office is sort of a
drag I get it
the machine's heavy but it's still
unfortunate that a $3,000 computer
doesn't include a more feature-rich
stand causing some of our more
vertically challenged staff to seek out
creative aftermarket solutions since you
can't even fix this with the good old
textbook trick thanks to the Rs long
legs and 35 pound heft so now that I
think about it if that weight even
really unreasonable that's only 12
pounds more than the Acer predator X 34
and that's just a monitor not to mention
that the other dimensions impressively
are nearly identical except for the Rs
extra inch of depth and speaking from
experience it wouldn't surprise me if
that extra inch was enough to make a lot
of magic happen working past then the 11
screws that hold the back panel on we
find an entire ball ass gaming rig worth
of parts Frankensteined into that extra
inch on the back of a samsung panel
seriously this thing is like a a crazy
science experiment gone horribly right
there's even two separate power supplies
with like this weird o-genki power
splitter in here I mean what else is
crammed in this thing our units got 16
gigs of 2666 megahertz
ddr4 ram on a standard mini ITX standard
MSI gt70 motherboard upgradability my
friends crazy it rocks an Intel Core i7
7700 K KB Lake processor and that's
cooled by what looks to my eye like a
custom 160 millimeter by 35 millimeter
ace attack all in one liquid cooling
system not too shabby
it's got a 1 terabyte hard drive as well
as a 480 gig SATA 3 SSD nvme MDOT -
equipped models are also available and
of course finally the PS de la
resistance a full sized GT X 1080
founders edition graphics card which has
its display outputs actually looped back
into the monitor Tim kayler style to a
separate PCB that runs the display and
the crummy onboard speakers the fact
that this rig is built with mostly
off-the-shelf parts gives it that
Frankenstein feel but it also gives it
some distinct advantages it's completely
upgradable as long as your new parts
would fit your new parts could fit and
if I mean assuming you don't want to use
it as a computer forever you could even
just use it as an ultra wide monitor
this thing has all the i/o of a full
conventional desktop setup the monitor
itself has all the usual display in port
though it does lack an OSD
the graphics cards outputs are all there
and easy to reach all the motherboard
ports are here including USB 3.1 10 gig
in both type a and type C flavors though
it should be noted those are
significantly more difficult to reach
and it's even got these
Franti Oh with a side located SD USB and
set of audio jacks and this is cool
up on the top there's even an extra USB
port for a you know a webcam or an
anti-air missile defense system whatever
you prefer but can all this stuff
cramped together under a plastic
covering stay cool under load well the
answer is shockingly yes yes it can we
use I 264 and fir mark to simultaneously
tax the CPU and the GPU neither of which
throttled instead leveling off at 70
degrees and 85 degrees respectively with
most of the components hovering around
50 degrees heat gets dissipated through
the perforations on the top and back of
the chassis and the warmest feeling area
is actually beneath the motherboard
plate which is perfect by the way for
keeping your nachos warm during extended
reading sessions the ARRA does start
humming under load however adding about
20 decibels to the room's
ambient noise in our testing though it
should be noted that this is about what
I would expect from having a you know
thoughtfully assembled gaming rig two
feet in front of my face and still way
quieter than the HP wave ocean simulator
if you don't big synthetic tests we
threw some real games at it as well
running all of our benchmarks at the
native 34 40 by 1440 resolution and then
again at 1080p
for comparison's sake as expected the 60
Hertz 3000 are curved ultra wide IPS
display is awesome to game on with great
contrast and viewing angles but it
doesn't have G sync and frankly the
colors are way off so without a
calibrator this one's not really
recommended for our friends who are
gamers by night and graphic designers or
photographers by day so is it better
than to buy a fancy-pants monitor and a
separate gaming rig or to save
faced with an all-in-one like the ARRA I
mean now that small form-factor pcs are
becoming more and more popular you could
make the argument that you're not saving
that much space but very few of them are
dedicated gaming rigs and even the ones
that are like the msi trident aren't
necessarily upgradable thanks to the use
of proprietary components in fact even
some of the ones that are advertised is
upgradable like the corsair one void
your warranty if you have the audacity
to pop the hood so then if you're
looking for the ultimate two trifecta of
desk space performance and future proof
nests and you've got the cash to back up
your search then accept no substitutes
because this thing is linked as the kids
say so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video

store which has cool shirts like this
