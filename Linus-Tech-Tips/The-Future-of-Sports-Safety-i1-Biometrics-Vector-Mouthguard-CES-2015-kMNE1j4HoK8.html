brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
alright guys welcome to the i1
biometrics booth where we will be
checking out their vector mouthguard you
may be wondering why the heck I'm
covering in a mouthguard
I find the integration of technology
into everyday things fascinating and
concussive injuries are an issue that is
very close to my heart as I come from a
heavy sports background I even had the
chance to try it out myself
alright guys so we walked away from one
of their booths with the mouth guard
that was actually syncs to the computer
so I'm nervously gonna have burkle
tackle me down right now we're gonna see
what the metrics are for me getting
tackled by Buerkle give me one moment
well that was exciting I think we
started all the few people on the show
for anyways the software for the
consumer version will log all of your
game collision data until you sync it
back up when you're at home once you
sync your unit your computer will be
able to view all of the data from the
linear acceleration to rotational
acceleration to head injury criteria as
you can see based on the model on the
screen when Nick van Berkel hit me I
tucked my head down to the side which
resulted in my brain impacting the other
side of my skull it wasn't a very heavy
impact because it wasn't a direct hit to
the skull but the data is logged for
referential reasons regardless safety in
sports is incredibly important and this
data can tell you more than just head
injury information a coach or parent
would be able to use this data to easily
identify bad habits like leading into a
tackle with your helmet in football and
then address that issue later on alright
guys hopefully you found this
interesting let me know in the comments
down below or on Twitter and if you want
to see all the rest of our CES content
which I can guarantee you is not mouth
guards please stay subscribed to Linus
tech tips also thank you to phantom
glass for protecting our phones and
helping us come here this year we have a
cool video coming from them soon I know
that sentence is burned into a few of
your brains but anyways also thank you
to HyperX check out youtube.com slash
