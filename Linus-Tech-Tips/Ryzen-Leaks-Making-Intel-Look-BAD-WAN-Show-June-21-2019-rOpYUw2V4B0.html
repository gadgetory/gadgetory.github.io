to victory live doesn't work said alive
again works perfectly welcome to the
land show it's gonna be awesome this
week I hope the to Linus faces brought
you right into this video there is a
leek MD risin 730 800 X Geekbench leek
also a rumor all the hard facts this
week about Intel gonna be slashing
prices ahead of the risin 3,000 launch
don't worry Lance is gonna be sitting
here soon enough he's just finishing a
video and I'm sitting here so Luke has a
real flesh bag to talk to ya and he's
gonna talk to you about Ubuntu dropping
32-bit support Linux stuff Google not
making tablets and a bunch of other cool
fun entertaining things and and stay
around for the intro roll the intro
if they cease represents our love
the let's eat
oh wait this part display and I don't
know how to funny sound this but merch
is cool and stuff it store
yeah let's start yeah I just realize we
didn't have someone
hey let's set up the camera but you know
it works either way let's start with
Ubuntu
let's leave the juicy rising topics ooh
here you scoot over linux me leave the
juicy rising topics for win-win linus is
here
Ubuntu is dropping 32-bit support it's
all it's all sad and and dying dreams
except for most people are on 64-bit
anyways and I would say the majority of
modern apps are running 64-bit not steam
not Nanyan theme and some other actually
fairly mission-critical apps for some
people but it's not the end of the world
because 18 point oh four long-term
support is is gonna be fine it will it
will keep on going so it'll be okay its
future launches that they're talking
input you're gonna have to eventually
kind of shove off of the 32-bit system
which is going to be a problem we see
like when Windows it's like okay we're
not gonna support Windows XP anymore and
we tell you guys like 6 years in advance
and then entire airports have massive
flow you don't think this is gonna be a
big kick in the butt oh god no no please
light us to relieve me take my chair do
I take your chair here let's let's let's
do a whole full swap oh wow there you go
this is awkward it's your chair oh lordy
I have a shirt on I got it no do you
think a triple XL all right that's fine
just know I had a medium before what
happened to it I was I swear I was
holding welcome to the organized show
yeah it's on time wearing the right
shirts yeah okay so lube unto is killing
future 32-bit support oh really oh it's
about time yeah it's been a while are
people mad
I bet people are mad people are probably
mad one funny thing that isn't gonna
work is steam
Oh kind of weird and I looked it up and
as far as I can tell there is no
official announcement still isn't it I
guess like it doesn't need more than our
real point whatever gigs they say need a
browser yeah yeah Wow like doesn't
really matter I've ever met you know
it's funny because I remember back when
I remember back when Windows XP x64 was
like the thing that if you were a sucker
for punishment you were playing around
with yes you were like well I got this
it's a 64-bit processor I'm gonna use it
I definitely ran it at one point
actually not any worse than Vista 64 my
perspective at least from my experience
and what was XP right before was one of
the operating systems that people would
complain about that I just never had a
problem with I I remember it I remember
noting that steam was 32-bit only being
like is this just part of like them
their whole hate on for Microsoft or
like what's what's their deal and no I
guess they just didn't feel like it and
I don't as far as I know there's no
official word of them switching but
there's gonna be a long term support
version of Ubuntu that's gonna keep
supporting 32-bit for quite a while
that's why only 300 people are watching
why is it unlisted I have no idea but I
just set it to public so cool hey hey
welcome everyone else who is who is
teaching now that they're actually
getting a notification we want wall
sorry I didn't know it was even I
getting yep oh that's def that's most
assuredly a thing and well I'm added I'm
gonna check and see if Jake ever
uploaded the vaad for that video that we
did earlier that's a that's a feature
that full plane is probably not gonna be
getting anytime soon
unlisted live stream Jake you you didn't
you didn't upload the vaad for that
thing we did the kak camera
no but upload I meant upload it like
live
well now we're strutting like not we
can't oh my god we can't launch it now
wait needed to go up
speaking of luxuries now if you're a
floatplane subscriber we have an app for
you now it's on the Android store look
it up it's actually really awesome it's
missing some features more features are
coming but as of right now for general
stuff it's actually a really good
experience check it out I actually had a
pretty rough date it seemed like it
before you even got on the show and
realized that it was unlisted and the
other video was not pushed so floatplane
we've got the floatplane and i'm kidding
yeah no it cancels your search that's
kind of not a great experience this app
is compatible with symmetry devices hey
just tech reviewer problems is it
actually compatible with my Casio fo
SmartWatch it says no oh oh wait oh okay
okay okay they're just all on here okay
yeah I was gonna be pretty impressed
loop like Jayden Wow
wow just wow that's really impressive
that's pretty that's pretty good I can
watch playing videos on my watch you
really went all the way out there so
yeah we tried to shoot the conclusion
for six video editors one CPU today okay
and between the display like long
DisplayPort cables you know it's a
problem yeah they just they just don't
work yeah
so between long DisplayPort cables that
don't work and potentially some kind of
networking issue I'm having a real bad
time real bad time with it and so the
editing gun right now is basically a
Flying Spaghetti Monster of USB
extension cables and DisplayPort
extension cables and there's a giant
Tower in the middle yeah I will say I
walked
it and I was like yeah that's crazy he's
gonna be late
the whole thing just looked nuts well
like this can't be this can't be good
and I just got confirmation that I am in
fact not in the office on Monday morning
so I don't know how that's going to get
finished because I'm going to Germany
next week so yeah yeah that was that was
pretty rough and I'm apparently going
camping this weekend so I have no idea
how any of that works so this is this is
actually sitting in the middle of our
editing room right now that's the
situation
hey but there's there's there's RGB
though yeah and at least everyone on the
left side of the frame is wearing the
appropriate Footwear yeah
to be working with such equipment uh you
know what why don't we just do some
actual time some second news let's talk
about some time we did technically start
with techniques we talked about Ubuntu
do really let's jump yeah you were here
talked about it oh yeah oh is that all
we've done so far that's all we've done
okay cool we can start from the top
right yeah what's up you guys yeah yeah
I I had just actually made that
discovery myself well not by myself
Colton messaged me I'm apparently going
camping so the conclusion of that video
is basically on you guys to figure out
yes good luck and what is it good night
and good luck
is that how it goes yeah I actually
really don't know what to do right now
because I also just haven't done like
the hosted part at the beginning and I
should really I should really do that
you should get so yeah we're like I
can't I can't leave it like that all
week but I can't play should uh you
should get Jake to deep fake your face
on to someone else see
yeah he's not talking you so sorry what
what are we doing what's the plan guys
you're having no real behind-the-scenes
experience ed you might as well come on
here this yeah this is how we make
videos okay we can leave all the cables
we can leave the cable sector ways
location and move it take the station
and move it and then what okay but that
but that doesn't help Jake like diagnose
it how many videos are you expecting
from me next week Jake's working on the
weekend no he's not yeah how many how
many videos do you need next week not
that many how many is not that many
because sometimes you say not that many
when you're like eight all right all
right these conversations are so much
more comfortable when you're not
actually like responsible for you only
had us down for three but did that
assume that we actually hit seven this
week did we hit seven oh so I didn't
even need to do that okay um okay so
then as long as I come in on Friday and
we shoot the conclusion then it's all
good why don't you guys just leave it in
there and then Jake can like fix it yeah
so when people are like on lunch he can
go in use their workstation tool around
with it okay okay so Jake one other
thing is maybe try the other fiber-optic
cable the 25-footer maybe see if that
one has compatible transceivers if that
actually is the problem you told me
there is a 25-footer Oh was that the
copper one oh okay you should take down
that copper cable so it doesn't get
close to the door again
welcome to when show ladies gentlemen
those awesome oh man that's great I yeah
I'm having I'm having a rough day but
you know what not as rough a day as
Intel so our big story today is of
course from guru 3d comm there are
leaked benchmarks of the rise in 730 800
X in Geekbench it apparently performs
roughly similarly to a core I $9.99
kay and that is a super terrible
situation for our friends over at Intel
courtesy of our also friends over at AMD
so not only is this bad because the
3,800 X is going to be cheaper than a 99
hundred K it's actually amazing this is
bad friend yeah bad for Intel good for
everything else is there anyone else
this is bad for Intel shareholders okay
but I would bundle them in their health
fanboys whatever they don't count they
their people okay fanboys are people I
disagree
not people so anyway so this is bad news
for Intel because not only is the 3,800
X cheaper than a ninety nine hundred K
it isn't even the top of AMD's lineup
let that sink in for a minute
that's pretty dated so the 3,800 X has a
base clock of 3.8 and boost of up to 4.5
from the look of things memory was not
configured correctly at only 20 133
megahertz and the test platform had a
3,800 X with an X 470 board instead of
an X 570 board so it wasn't even on the
optimal chipset for this CPU now that's
not to say that we expect a chipset
change to make an enormous difference to
performance it's just that the x5 7 a
chipset does have support for PCI
Express Gen 4 so it will have
performance advantages if you have
components that leverage that and the
word on the street is that the x5 70
boards that are coming out have in terms
of a Seuss's rog boards anyway much
better optimized memory traces and they
said there were some other secret sauce
they wouldn't tell me because we didn't
want people to copy it which could
result in higher memory speeds which
would have a performance impact so we're
not saying that it's a bad situation
where now we're just saying that if they
were running on like an rog board that's
next 570 it could be quite a bit faster
cool so
yeah one thing is that in
single-threaded
as you might expect 9900 K is still a
little bit faster we're talking 1% okay
yeah that's with faster memory okay
there was apparently a situation where
it was like 14% better on a single
thread on a singular thread but that was
with faster memory that was with a
faster memory yeah oh boy so in response
until it's possibly gonna slash some
prices this is a rumor the previous one
was a leak we're dealing with a lot of
like kind of you know not be the
absolutely most reliable information
here but they all seemed kind of
realistic so I mean if I was Intel that
would pretty much be what I was doing I
think their shortages are mostly
resolved at this point so yeah they're a
lot better now than they were like okay
yeah for last year would you say
resolved no resolved was the wrong word
it's always absolute yeah less bad less
bad let's go with less bad yeah I mean
if there wasn't competition I don't
think they're at the point where they
would be cutting pricing but to me this
is really less of an indication that
Intel is you know that their supply is
better and more of an indication that
they think in order to sell the supply
that they have that's the pricing that
they think they need to be at so the
thing about chip manufacturing is you
don't like it's not like hand making you
know designer wallets on Etsy or
something where you you know if you get
an order for 10 you can be like oh well
I'll just make 10 this week and then if
you get an order for one you can be like
that's chill I'll go do something else
it's not like that ramping production up
and down is an enormous undertaking so
it's actually far better I mean that's
where you end up with like you know
flash or memory manufacturers selling
DRAM and selling NAND flash at a loss
because you are better off just
flashing your prices like it's a
commodity and ignoring your costs then
you are like turning off a fab like you
lose less if I if that makes sense you
losing 10% making stuff and then selling
it at a 10% loss is less harmful than
just shutting down the fab which is sort
of crazy so Intel is not gonna adjust
their production in all likelihood I
don't have confirmation on that they're
just gonna slash their pricing so that
they can keep moving the same volume
because that keeps the Machine operating
smoother side bar thing I would love to
see a skit with hipster lioness making
Etsy products oh I only got one order
for a wallet that's chill I'll just like
I'll do someone else you know it's fine
I'll design a new Etsy front you'll make
some videos my Etsy store would be full
of like this stupidest stuff I mean you
guys have seen me try and do arts and
crafts tech showdown was not a popular
series long term it did not as bad as
you might expect it didn't do great but
I think some of them did better than we
than we thought they had a little bit
more of a tail than I expected have we
done our sponsor spots we've done the
intro we've not done as most of us we
haven't been live very long though
alright it doesn't matter display when
this plate is the artwork you can hang
on your wall
that's made of metal but that won't cut
you they're durable you don't need any
power tools to mount a display art piece
they've got over a quarter a million
different arts spanning a bunch of
different styles and influences and with
their easy magnetic mounting there's no
holes in the wall it's easy to
straighten out if anything goes wrong
and they're replaceable they plant ten
trees for every display it's sold so
head to LMD g / display twin and use
code ltte to save 15% today beautiful
also sponsoring the show today is
private Internet access
dia you get support for a variety of VPN
protocols and types of encryption and
authentication allowing you to dial in
exactly the level of privacy protection
that you need they've got apps for
Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux and
Google Chrome with support for several
other platforms coming
and you can connect up to five devices
at once on a single account their apps
include DNS leak protection and ipv6
leak protection and their internet kill
switch will block all traffic if the VPN
becomes disconnected unexpectedly check
it out today at LM GGG / p ia when
finally the Linus tech tips store grab a
shirt grab a hoodie grab a water bottle
cable ties at LM GGG / when LT t store I
think the water bottles are restocked
now so Peter bought one yes we have lots
of them sick yeah I would have just
given him I know I told him that okay
yeah but he got one and he received it
that was cool
I guess he likes it the system works
yeah it's good we actually have some we
actually had some new merge pictures oh
okay I'm uh I was the photographer for
them so I'm just gonna go ahead I'm
gonna pull this up and she's it this is
that okay so this is a teaser for an
upcoming video I don't want to say too
much because I don't know what's public
yeah
very little is public actually this is
gonna be a pretty fantastic video so I'm
just gonna pull this up so basically
Brandon gets pretty triggered every time
someone messages him on Twitter and is
like I want to be a great photographer
what camera should I buy and he's like
alright so it's hard to give you the
right answer when you're asking the
wrong question because becoming a
photographer is about developing a style
learning the fundamentals you know
understanding the correct way to take a
photo so that you can push the
boundaries and experiment with the art
form note that I didn't say anything
about your camera okay another way to
trigger Brandon show them one of those
key notes for a cell phone launch where
they say take DSLR like phone
with your phone yeah he'll be like no
that's just actually not how that works
so on the one hand Brandon gets
triggered if you ask him which camera to
buy to make you better photographer but
on the other hand he gets triggered if
you tell them that a phone is just as
good as a real camera so this is great
Brandon actually came up with the idea
and we got in a camera that he was
really excited to play around with 51
megapixels is it 51 point 4 megapixels
so this is the Fujifilm GFX 50 are so
crazy camera like crazy camera to the
point where I'm sure people out there
would think wow with a camera like that
in my hands I could be a photographer no
problem and so what what he came up with
was we weren't really sure how to like
make a video about a product like that
because it's a medium format camera
which is really designed for a certain
type of work like it's it's a tool
designed for a certain type of job you'd
say high fashion photography you know
anything that you were to photograph
that you would expect to print the size
of you know the site of a building you
would capture with a camera like that
like the level of detail that it can
capture is incredible and I kind of
forget where I'm going with this very
roundly story but long story short Brad
and I were talking and he kind of
pitches me this crazy idea and he goes
how about this we do a photography
challenge but we take an inexperienced
photographer and I am at best an
inexperienced photographer I think
that's generous we take an inexperienced
photographer we arm them with the GFX 50
R and then we put them up against an
experienced photographer with a
smartphone and we resolve once and for
all
does a smartphone hold up against the
real camera and once and for all does an
amazing camera turn you into a
photographer if you're just some random
scrub I love part of this concept
because you're basically making him
fight against himself
because if he does too good of a job so
Brandon with a pixel three versus me
with a Fujifilm GFX fifty are now I'm
not going to share a ton of this with
you but I just want to show you guys one
of my photos some of them are just far
too spoilery but beyond the store at
some point okay I mean it's wonderful oh
it's not it was just loading yeah yeah
okay I mean the highlights are a little
a little blown out on that one
yep his face is like actually just pure
white yep yeah I mean it is coltan it's
probably pretty close so in fairness to
me yeah like you shine a light at coltan
the guy's pretty white does he have a
bottom Sun at all no he doesn't have
pants on my understanding is that he was
wearing underwear okay but it's possible
he wasn't I have no way of verifying
that he was in fact wearing underwear
okay anyway guys look forward to this
video if nothing else it's gonna be a
ton of fun if nothing else seeing Colton
with no pants on ten out of ten
and there's this there's fun there's
there's far worse no I'm sorry guys I
really can't show this to you guys
because it's gonna be such a moment in
the video but make sure you don't miss
the photography challenge I'm actually
very proud of this photo you guys need
to put that on a wall so just cuz it's
so awkward it's pretty out there so
you've seen that one yeah well yeah he's
he's seen all of it he's seen all of it
so guys I mean should I you know what I
will give you I will give you one small
spoiler
it's really close like this does not end
up being a blowout so no matter what you
think no matter what preconceived
notions you come into this video with
you're right
[Laughter]
oh people are so bad in chat I'm so me
not showing them though any of those
pictures guys it's like actually come on
I really can't I really can't yeah I
really can't show you I did show you
it's like if we showed the benchmarks
for every benchmarking video on wine
show before the video came out yeah it
is actually pretty much exactly like
that it's a problem yep okay crazy stuff
Google done making tablets that's not
crazy it's crazy that they ever thought
they people cried and no one else cared
it does suck because competition reasons
yeah I saw it so I sold that from
marques cuz he made a tweet about that
looks very valid inside of that I don't
care were they competition but who else
was but were they competition not really
would have been nice if they stayed in
it and like actually drive but really no
one was competition the iPad stands
alone as the tablet and it has like the
thing is I'm an Android I'm even an
Android user like your primary Android
phone from my cold dead fingers but
Android is so poorly optimized as a
tablet experience what annoys me too is
Android in tablet mode looks beautiful
and sucks I don't know it's annoying
anyways yeah that's yeah basically all
we have to say about that
really we can't give any details
Google is no longer planning to make any
tablet Hardware going forward and we'll
put all resources behind laptops in the
future Chrome OS Chrome OS is the future
Google had two smaller tablets in the
works both have been cancelled pixel
slate was Google's first Chrome OS
tablet but it worked best when docked
with a keyboard and trackpad also known
as a laptop
yeah so yeah they're not doing the
tablets anymore but Chrome OS is not
canceled okay I mean you know the thing
about Chrome OS is like I make a face
whenever we talk about Chrome OS because
it's simply not suitable for me there's
a lot of people that Chrome OS could
make sense for the only issue right now
is that it has to be cheap at the same
price I'll take Windows I'll take Mac OS
at the same price but as long as Chrome
OS keeps showing up on super cheap
devices than I guess but as Microsoft
continues to march toward Windows as a
service and making all their money off
of like Xbox subscriptions that people
are running on Windows wind I you know
what I'm gonna do it I'm gonna call it
within the next how many years am I
gonna get myself here how do I go
aggressive or do I do I go conservative
I would get considering the quality of
some of the call-outs that have been
made on way and show I'm gonna do you're
gonna do it I'm gonna go aggressive I
was gonna say go kind of middle line
three years Windows is free three years
yeah okay I kind of knew where you were
going and I was kind of thinking five
but I I was gonna say fire you know what
no I'm going aggressive I tell you I
tell you what here's how I hedge my bets
I predict I line a sebastian on this the
21st day of June 2019 predict that
Windows will be free to install will it
will be announced that win that a free
version of Windows is at least coming by
three years from today there it will at
least be announced even if it's not
quite available I don't want to lose on
a technicality like it's coming in the
fall or something stupid like that
that's it and the reason I call the
reason I call three years is that we're
gonna be a couple years into the new
generation of Xboxes you know I think
that's going to be one of the ways that
Microsoft is going to monetize Windows
without actually charging for licenses
and once windows is free I think Google
has a problem for Chrome OS yeah why why
do I use Chrome OS at that point okay
maybe it's power efficient but windows
forearm also exists now and there are
devices that you can buy now if you're
determined enough and you're crazy
enough so I mean yeah I guess there's
the App Store like if you're running on
arm the Android Play Store is probably
quite competitive hard to say yeah
when's our Windows Store floatplane app
coming he's got it open now I'm teasing
I am gonna grill you on stream though I
am gonna I'm gonna grill you right now
when is floatplane launching what define
define launching out more creators more
Korea more creators so we had of alpha
into beta aisle beta waiting at beta
we're calling it base so when we bring
out more craters we're just calling that
beta because we don't really have like
it we're calling that data okay yeah so
LTX is kind of a goal we had a meeting
about today the flow playing career out
of meeting mode today I asked everybody
we've got a deadline that is technically
before LTX but we have to finish before
then so we can actually get creators on
I'm not gonna say when that is and I was
like does anyone for any discernible
reason think they can't be done in time
and it was just pure silence okay and
right before then one of the members of
the team said their part would be done
by this coming Friday conservatively
which is notably ahead of the deadline
there are some problems like one of them
I'm not gonna name the company right now
but who I'm saving
that email you saw is that the C word is
now 32 emails long and we still don't
have a solution because they just won't
do it
so far no the first email went out
really really early last Friday
it's
we been over seven days worth of 24-hour
periods not really because not Saturday
yet but technically because it was sent
so early on Friday it's been over seven
days and it is for any tier we're on a
high tier I'm not going to say because
it would give it away too easily but on
any tier it's also take roughly three
days to do so it's been over seven days
so far and it's three working days so if
they don't do it today which I still
don't have an email and 6:08 p.m.
they're probably gone probably gone fed
they're probably not gonna do it on the
weekend so it's probably not gonna be
done until Wednesday which is almost two
weeks from when we first asked for it
and I am upset e spaghetti and we need
that for the lunch yeah of beta yeah
okay
so everything else is on track and we're
currently being blocked by an external
company we're being C blocked yes in
other news
Simone Gertz built her own Tesla truck
yeah super cool so the source here model
3 is obviously her Channel
yeah but I'm not gonna show you much of
it because you should go watch it go
give her views there that's all you get
to see yeah go watch it yeah go watch it
and there's this which is like the
commercial for it which is really cool
and kind of fun and stuff but then she
also has a video about like she goes and
buys the car and then she drives around
for a little bit and then they they
modify it and she pulls in a bunch of
friends and it's really cool so yeah the
team essentially I mean ok to be clear
like they didn't scratch build a Tesla
truck they basically hacked the back off
of a model 3 getting rid of the back
passenger seats to make room for a DIY
truck bed so like and a full sheet of
wood pallet rack thing at the top not
pallet I don't remember to call it an ad
buy whatever sheet of plywood and 8 by 4
8 by 4 mm-hmm is that right well that's
what a standard sheet of plywood is okay
sure that maybe I'm thinking inches or
some I don't know either way that thing
fits on the rails on top of the truck
needs properly because it was like one
inch away from fitting in the bed but
they couldn't do it
so mount it up top now it's really cool
my back hurts I'm fine so does mine but
I'm sure freaking pose man Oh tonight
yes I got Ivonne into it I saw oh did
you know she's like she woke up the next
day she's like I was like dreaming about
settlement layouts it's like so
addictive I've been I've been playing
cross-code oh yeah on stream for
probably like two two and a half hours I
don't know if I'm gonna keep streaming
it it's not a very you know in because
you really actually need to focus
yeah especially when you're doing the
puzzles in the dungeons like they're not
the way they introduce game mechanics is
not perfect they introduce a new
mechanic by basically plunking you in a
room where that's the one thing that you
need to like learn but that's been I'm
not that far obviously it's a really
long game and I was taking my time with
certain things like I law I noticed in
like the first area there's some jumping
puzzle things to find special loot
things and I'm like vom getting these
which is also not that entertaining for
the stream but I was like I don't care
because I'm having fun and and then I
found this one thing that's like you
need a key and you should backtrack to
find it I'm like well I'm finding that
key and I have no idea where it is you
just need to like play the game yeah and
then you can go back like in 15 or 15 to
20 hours okay yeah all right no okay
also don't if you try to get every every
item you will actually just snap your
controller in half in frustration so I'm
sure I'm super easy mode right now
so far I've gotten all of them except
for the one that I need the key for but
I'm again I mean literally the starting
area so yeah I'm sure have you done all
the quests in the the starting harbor
I've done all but one have you done the
one where there's like I need to find
this fan smuggler oh no no I haven't
done all the question starting Arbour I
do
that one's a real piss off
good to know but yeah it's fun I like it
a lot actually it feels probably exactly
how it should feel
yeah I died once but I died because I
was an idiot and when I died I was like
yeah I'm an idiot
you'll die more okay no I'm sure I like
there was a corner and I'm used to
modern games where if you did like a
dodge spin and you hit a corner yeah
just like move you around it yeah this
one's like nah no so I spun into it all
three times and then was like oh and now
you can't move I guess it was really fun
I'm for that one more the piece of
actual news iOS 13 will remind you to
cancel your subscription when you delete
an app if it is managed through the iOS
store thing that's pretty sick it is
yeah cuz like it is so easy like I don't
I don't look that closely at my credit
card bill for anything that doesn't
stand out yeah like something that's
like it's like a couple bucks bucks you
know I'm gonna think about it I and it's
like a weird company like I might think
oh I just who knows right like there's
there's a ton of things that you just
use a credit card for and you know might
like I travel a lot so maybe it was a no
maybe it was a tip at a restaurant like
I don't know if it's like three or four
dot like you never know but it's a pack
of gum but it's it's it's not like you
know fifty bucks and I'm like whoa what
is that so it's so easy for these little
tiny things to kind of get overlooked
for months at a time and meanwhile the
app maker is just collecting that
recurring revenue so it's really cool
that Apple has taken it upon themselves
to remind users to cancel their
subscription so because really like this
is a good move
you might remember to cancel your
subscription if you see the little icon
there all the time
you might not want to bother because
it's like annoying but then eventually
if you're gonna go on honest all the app
you might jump into and cancel yourself
but if you uninstall the app without
thinking about it you're very unlikely
to look into cancelling yourself in the
future Play Store apparently does it all
according to school ug Satan actually
didn't know about that I have tried to
very many never subscribed through an
app me neither
I don't yeah I'm just trying to think if
there's anything that I have in-app
purchased everything that I was
subscribed to personally through a
browser by the way someone I'm gonna
respond to your review but someone
reviewed during the LAN show the app and
said it would be great if there's
notifications there are notifications we
just don't have a like account control
dashboard thing so if you I know it's
coming don't worry about it
there's some other stuff coming first
but if you go on the website and turn on
notifications you will get them in the
app I can be a really crazy idea oh boy
so we we missed our upload window spot
for that reassembling the red 8k camera
video okay I think I'm gonna add we
missed our upload slot for the red 8k
camera reassembly video what do you
think of having one of the editors like
instead of just uploading it as a stream
archive why don't we cut it and like
make it better yeah do you think there's
any value to that yeah why don't we do a
tldr version and then we can just leave
the full stream unlisted throw it in the
video description if people want to see
the whole thing this one's sweet I would
want that as a viewer yeah and that
saves us saves us a video yeah you just
generated a whole video it's double
dipping a little I think but I I'm I'm
letting it slide to be like nice boy um
what's the name of the game Luke enjoy
it oh he was he's playing cross-code
yeah I played it I played it through
over the last like a few months really
really enjoy it's gonna take me a long
time cuz I'm a little completionist D
about things
I know trust me just don't I can let go
of it eventually but when I first
started game I'm usually kind of that
way don't just let it go now it's like
some of them are really hard like so the
it has this jumping puzzle mechanic
where it's which is kind of hard and I
think would be easier on a controller um
maybe yeah doing the angle jumps is kind
of hard on it but the hard part
sometimes is just finding where to get
to it and a lot of the time like you'll
go seven or eight screens over so it's
like it's a 2d sprite-based RPG so it
has like screens for the for the map
that you kind of move over so you'll go
eight or nine screens over and you'll
find the point where you can get up on
the ledge and then you have to like make
your way all the way back there and and
III will criticize this particular
aspect of the game most of the time what
you find is crap that you don't need
yeah it's like the little loot box
things I've opened is like okay it's
like some items that you could just
thrash some hedge hags and then just go
by or just not buy because honestly I
barely used items other than like
sandwiches for health recovery at all
there were a couple bosses where I was
like okay I need a DPS boost right now
because this sucks but that is it yeah
we're gonna say yeah the one thing that
I don't like to be honest and it's gonna
take me a little while to get used to is
the like two and a half D nature of the
game or sometimes like I can't really
tell if another platform is higher or
lower than mine taking some scenarios
you can you do get the hang of it and
I'm assuming I will eventually get the
hang of it and one thing that I did
learn was if I just shoot it depending
on seeing where the projectile hits can
sometimes tell me yeah and like there's
but that that has been a little
frustrating so far there's been some
jumps where I'm like yeah I can make
this jump and then I jump in I just hit
the wall and fall and I'm like oh it was
too high okay
did we talk about LTX um no do I have
you know oh we should do if there's a
blog post we should definitely go
through it I wonder did they put the no
no it's not there wait wheres a map
I saw Colton a minute ago yeah cuz we
finalized the floor plan :
hey cold no you around oh he's gone
that's right it was worth a shot
the map was cool it was here last week
you guys talked about it last week you
were on the show dude hi yes we did you
and I talked about it did we did we show
it we showed all we showed it yeah okay
we couldn't zoom in far enough to like
show what each booth name was but people
were able to see the layout people could
see where the BYOC section was exhibit
the main stage was all that fun stuff we
did so many like crazy videos in the
last little bit the Edit is almost done
for the slo-mo does 240 Hertz matter
okay that's cool um we can probably talk
about it a little bit actually because
there's like there's so much to this
video that I feel like I'm not really
spoiling anything by showing you guys
some stuff from it hey ed ed are you
around yes
what's the file format for the images
for the 240 Hertz monitor video are they
just P Angie's like is it something I
can open here and are they just in L
wall or no I don't have Photoshop on
this thing all right well the images
RPGs the things with graphics are yes
T's okay cool so if I fire this up is
this the hitbox once or the hitmarker
ones I think people have figured out
that if they review the app right now I
get a notification my phones boy Oh are
these the screenshots of like the shot
though in the video yeah so this is
every shot I took cool okay neat and is
this how many frames and we were from
first from first pixel can't guarantee
that okay so let's talk about let's talk
about this a bit this is really cool
I say what thing no it's okay I think
it's alright okay so this is cool so
what we're looking through right now is
a gallery of Ed freeze framing so we're
shooting at a thousand frames per second
on a phantom camera and edie's freeze
framing and cat is capturing the frame
where I pull the trigger okay so this is
where I take my shot remember guys yeah
obviously I'm pretty far off the mark
here like I yeah I missed no no I'm
saying how you could tell when you pull
the trigger oh no that's not how you
can't oh yeah it's fine it's just really
easy to tell because it's not a thousand
frames per second and every frame is
like crystal clear it's so sharp it
looks like a still image they can't hear
you you have to come over here it
actually freezes for like two or three
frames okay that's how you could tell me
okay cool so basically what we're
looking at is at 60 Hertz versus 240
Hertz where I took my shot so this guy
right here jumps out from around this
corner or runs out from around this
corner now he's holding a knife but he's
actually not running at full knife speed
it's about 80% so here's here's my first
shot that one I got him so this is
probably the next run now yeah this is
at 558 milliseconds ish and then 858
milliseconds so it took me about a third
of a second to take my second shot okay
yeah this is a new run so this is yeah
run two shot
run two shot one I missed run two shot
two I think that was actually a miss
really I don't yeah I don't think I got
him on that one no wait that looks so
long and probably a hit remember too
that there's issues with hit detection
in the game so we are capturing not
necessarily location in them yeah hitbox
location we're capturing how well our
gamer managed to click on the tar
so if the hitbox is off and it registers
is amiss we're not penalizing our gamer
for that because that doesn't tell us
anything valuable about how well people
can aim it 60 versus 240 years more game
knowledge okay so here's run three shot
one that that was a Miss by the way it
looks like it's just overs pretty close
and then this is my second shot that
ended up being a hit
okay so that's all at sixty Hertz so now
we're at 240 but you guys suppose we're
trying to pull head shots cuz you're
okay yeah yeah I'm trying I wall I don't
know if II did you try for a head shot
every time not consciously okay yeah
well the results are gonna be really
interesting because the big no-no it's
fine it's fine because this honestly
this video is fascinating regardless of
how much I try to spoil because one of
them one of the biggest takeaways was
how differently everyone aimed so we'd
love to have a much bigger sample size
because check this out
oh wait are we frozen we're back so
check this out you guys that was weird
OBS froze so just so you guys know that
was OBS don't blame floatplane please
you guys should get I know like just a
different computer oh yeah I'm talking
about that though get-get like logitech
to work with you guys and bring in the
c9 team yeah we'd know jessic we'd love
to do it again with programmers that's
fine they're still pro gamers they're
still on a completely different level
from us alright so anyway let's let's
look at this so Mike Wow so my first 240
Hertz shot you can see I actually took
me almost a second what's funny is my
first one was really fast at 60 Hertz I
mean I took my second shot no no this is
round one no this is run one shot one so
that's like similar so I'm not even
going any faster
also I think here we go not even going
any faster but what's really interesting
is these are all hedge
shots 1 2 3 those were all hits so the
way that I line up my shots I'm actually
so remember when we played the pub G and
I was looking for the first time we got
chicken down here on our first game I
think we got two chicken dinners that
night didn't we we yes and we only
played three games I think for four
games yeah okay so you only one gap
between the winds so I was I was being
really hard on myself because I like
didn't know what ammo went in any of the
guns I don't know the maps I don't know
any of the mechanics of the game like I
felt like a complete idiot but it didn't
really matter who we're telling me I was
helpful yeah I was like I don't feel
that helpful but then what the one thing
that I was doing was I was dealing
damage from far away and when I was
watching the way that I aim a thousand
frames per second it makes so much sense
so I'm a good shot but not in close
quarters
I aim like a sniper no matter what I'm
doing
so what I'll try to do is I will try I
will watch my target I will watch for an
opportunity because I have this mind set
in the back of my mind even when I'm not
thinking about it that every time I pull
the trigger I'm giving them an
opportunity to find me so I tend not to
pull the trigger any more than I have to
compared to Ed who he's just like there
it is there's a flick look he'll try to
just go for the flick shot flick shot
kill then he's like tracking it bang
bang bang bang bang he's just pulling
the trigger as often as he can you're
doing like two per run whereas I got no
more than two shots out per run I think
three was my max wasn't it
like barely did I do four and that but
one was into the wall where he went out
so I was like I'm like go go so my
accuracy or precision accuracy my
accuracy was actually no different at 60
versus 240 Hertz but my kill times were
actually lower so they
is only 651 milliseconds this one's 905
so my average kill time was actually
lower and my kill consistency was higher
at higher frame rates had a higher frame
refresh refresh rate but if you look at
my actual spread yeah it's like pretty
frickin consistent pretty consistent
yeah because in those games in pub G I
remember relatively early on we figured
just give you a sniper and you can spot
people and then we started realizing
them give you a sniper and then they're
all at half HP when we fight them we're
like well that's pretty neat cool this
is ad at 60 Hertz so that's this first
shot way off way off okay so he managed
to hit him here I think no you missed
nevermind so that's a near miss but you
got to scroll down we can't see the
cross that's the cost isn't it oh sorry
oh no it's a body shot body shot but we
were going for the head so that's a Miss
ah sorry ID that's a miss that's a miss
was too slow okay so we were running at
more like my preferred most sensitive
what do you guys just have different
because we wanted that v we wanted the
only variable to be refresh rate and
gamer so but okay alright and we had
order here you but if he's we had
practice runs okay it's silly it's a bit
it's a bit ed agreed with the
methodology you agreed to it yeah anyway
so if you look through here whoops mmm
oh yeah that was weird so these are all
sixty Hertz runs and you can see he's
like kind of all over the place
compared to my shots but watch this this
is his 240 Hertz results oh my god so
the way the way this is all on the head
the way that head aims when we watch his
movements is so different from the way
that I aim that the way that 240 Hertz
benefits him ends up being completely
different from the way it benefits me
because I am gonna watch for my target
to move in a consistent manner I'm gonna
track them and pull the trigger when I'm
ready so it took me longer at 60 Hertz
to do yeah so you're gonna be able to
start those processes a little bit
faster and it makes it easier for
because the animation is smooth it makes
it easier for me to tracking and Edie
because he's trying to flick across it
he's actually got two moving things that
he's watching his he's got his crosshair
and he's got the target he's trying to
kind of like line them up the more data
you can get into his brain the better
the chance that he's gonna make that
make that shot and when he doesn't have
it he's like what year is it
and then gaff gaff from slow-mo guys he
was fascinating too but I'm not gonna
spoil any of that right now but it is an
utterly riveting video really it was a
lot of fun yes should maybe not this
year because we're like legit running
out of time yeah but it'd be really cool
if you guys did like an aiming workshop
at LTX an aiming workshop so you like do
this with people at LTX
I like show them how they cool I don't
think we could get it in time no this
doesn't sound like a 20-19 yeah this
sounds like something where we'd have to
really give some thought to the layout
of the booth like we'd have to have like
a few stations a few phantoms and like
operators who are trained on how to do
it and like you'd have to kind of come
back in an hour yeah so we could
actually do analysis of you're aiming
style
I think another we're like I don't know
necessarily who but it would be cool if
you worked with a like a pro team and
have the protein breakdown people's hell
yeah
that would be very cool best aim or best
FPS players of all time
IMO because it's not on the mic yeah
yeah all right we should probably do
some super chats and I think that's
pretty much it for the show today guys
um other side guy says your thoughts on
Google Stadium and other streaming
services silently killing off mod
development and mod installation due to
no obvious file access meaning mods that
can can meaning mods can't be made or
used yeah you know what it's just one of
the disadvantages of moving gaming into
the cloud so disadvantage number one is
of course latency that's the most
obvious one disadvantage number two is
super oh yeah right that you are relying
not just on the game service but also
the streaming service in order to
continue to have access to your games in
some situations and we're already
running into that a lot like there's a
ton of games out there that you know
when it first started happening I think
people didn't think it was a big deal
this transition from dedicated servers
that are self hosted by gamers to
community servers that are hosted
instead by the game developer when it
first started happening it didn't seem
like a big deal because every game was
still playable but as those ones with
developer hosted servers have started to
disappear there's like entire there's
huge gaps in the history of gaming that
simply cannot be experienced anymore and
there's some teams that have worked
really hard to fill those gaps but it's
not gonna be possible with everything
that's right due to due to various
reasons and you're gonna have to have a
team of people or at least one really
dedicated person who are dedicated
enough to work through all of that stuff
to force it to actually function or a
developer slash publisher that is
willing to allow it like which has
happened like Supreme Commander so yeah
that's that's yet another problem and
then problem number three is yeah yeah
modding I think it's it's going to be
okay it's going to be a problem but I
also think it's not going to be as big a
problem as those other things are
because quite frankly the type of people
who are willing to settle for a stadia
like experience with respect to latency
and with respect to not owning the
software that they buy we run
likely to start digging around in config
files and downloading texture packs now
with that said modding is a lot simpler
these days than it used to be thanks to
innovations like the Steam Workshop but
I just don't see it being as big of an
issue compared to those other two just
because I think it's kind of a different
customer and we're gonna have a really
long overlap between cloud gaming and
local gaming just because game
developers want the largest possible
install base for their software so yeah
I think it's gonna be a big problem I
just I don't think it's a problem yet
and I don't have a solution yeah either
side guy where is the tech yest loving
for our boy Brian from Tech yes City LTX
invite so part of the problem with
inviting everyone is that flights and
accommodations are really expensive and
part of the problem with including
people from way way overseas is that
those flights are particularly expensive
so there was no real like there's no
real discrimination people who reached
out to us early on got budget and people
who didn't didn't in some cases like I
will say Hard Rock Canucks has made a
huge effort to be there they were really
late getting back to us but they ended
up agreeing to split the cost with us so
that they could be there so that you
know allowed us to work around our
budgetary constraints we did have to
stretch a little bit for them but they
kicked in so that that's how they're
able to be there like we've we've worked
with people to make it as easy as
possible to have as many creators there
as possible but we can't have everyone
also I did meet with Brian at Computex
oh that's cool yeah
ah just did not cut it
use super chats to support freaky
question mark um no I think we we called
out people to uh to support free geek
directly last week that was sort of the
strat Simon loved the LAN show and
floatplane for iOS it's coming yeah it's
actually it's been developed in parallel
with the Android app is just taking
longer to get App Store there's some
massive amount more hurdles you have to
jump to get on App Store
not this time says do you recommend
Linux depends what you're doing but yeah
probably not you're like gonna browse
the Internet oh yeah speaking of OS as I
take over Chrome OS Linux yeah if I have
to learn something anyway yeah Dane says
last week my $5 chat was not read mmm
I said take this five dollars and throw
it on the street just toss it there and
make that ten dollars now thanks okay
specifically you Luke apparently oh yeah
or you could just buy food heck yeah
instead of throwing it on the street
yeah especially cuz I wasn't gonna pass
that super chat through to you anyway
yeah not really how it works yeah
Morna says had to use a VPN to give you
money from croatia PS please floatplane
for android TV app it's there's there's
so much one of the things about making
like a modern video playing app or
website or whatever is that a lot of
those platforms or apps or whatever have
like ten trillion features so we're
working on it there is actually a lot of
features in the app right now there's
just also quite a massive pile more to
go so there's there's there's features
coming right now I believe the main
thing that's being worked on is casting
so that's coming that will be cool
I already partially works and there's
more stuff coming down the pipeline
including dark mode and all this other
kind of stuff people are asking for we
are listening it is coming they got to
give us gotta give us some time
scratcher says June 21st 2019 windows
will be free too
still a spur lioness three years from
now there it is boom Midland productions
good evening you guys I was wondering
your thoughts on something would you say
SATA SSDs are standard for computer
builds now or have nvme SSDs surpass
them already it depends on mobile nvme
is everywhere but I would still say that
SATA is good enough for the vast
majority of people and a lot of the time
you'll see I'm not twos in laptops and
they're still SATA so it's hard for me
to say without like really digging down
into people's products tax yeah like if
you're at Best Buy or whatever buying a
desktop I would be surprised if it's got
an nvme drive in it if it's a laptop
anything sort of premium like mainstream
premium I'd say is gonna be nvme in most
cases Frank eg says is AMD doing big
enough things with their CPUs to get
Linus to use one in his own rig instead
of an Intel chip you know what they've
got an opportunity but it's gonna be a
little bit tricky because my personal
rig is actually in a separate room and I
use Thunderbolt 2 a dock to carry my
display and all my peripheral signals
over a single thin cable and right now
Thunderbolt is not supported on AMD now
as USB 4 which is Thunderbolt starts to
be picked up by AMD motherboards a now
we're talking but as it is it's not
officially supported I do believe
Wendell from level 1 Tech's got it
working on some weird MSI or gigabyte
guy wants it yeah and I believe there's
a couple different boards of support in
it so possibly it's possibly because I
actually undid my last CPU upgrade back
on a 59 60 X so I am still primed and
ready for a CPU upgrade and I am waiting
to see how it goes - looks so small next
to Luke thanks the gamer cave Adam
you're the best Lance and luke love your
channels learning a lot never get rid of
Dennis - didn't intend to
alright I've only got time for a couple
more here so Ilya says why wasn't there
a notification I'm 45 minutes late sorry
dog I blame Luke yeah
would it be possible for me to be a beta
tester for floatplane as a streamer so
we're not really streamer focused at
least not right now yet and it will be a
while
Oh Marshall says how does Luke feel
about nebula
so you weren't here when we discussed
nebula no it's it's interesting I I
think to a certain degree more of these
types of things in our space is going to
normalize this for users and creators so
that's good I wouldn't have set it up
the way they did well obviously yeah I
mean that's like you're literally
building a video platform so you didn't
I would have done it you did it but
there are some changes I would have done
for floatplane if I knew if me and the
team knew what we know now there are
some things that I would have done
differently okay there's there's a lot
of things that are done differently
there's like a couple primary ones that
I would have done differently but but
there's some core design philosophies
behind how they are handling their video
content right that I do not think is a
great idea but well I've invited I've
invited one of the creators onto the
show that'd be cool to look at a chance
to talk to them I don't I just think
that it's like the way that I see it is
you could view us as competitors but
we've both were both such so much
smaller fish that like it's better to
kind of be aligned yeah yeah at least at
this stage in the game yeah I'm saying
like like we're both rather small and I
think basically everybody in this more
specific Josh is rather small and having
more of us that are doing well is a good
thing yes so I wish them the best in
this risk game you know Google has North
America and South America Amazon is
holding on to Europe you know who else
even exists yeah
does Microsoft really do in online video
pay for the live streaming platform
mixer okay
so Microsoft has all strengths or takes
up northern ireland's I mean while like
you know Nebula and floatplane are
hanging out in like Japan and Kamchatka
like they can't really penetrate North
America because it's really heavily
fortified but like every turn they can
collect three armies and then take just
one country in Asia and then maybe start
to collect for once they can get 12
countries and playing a risk with the
kid clearly and you know start to and
just have a big enough you know
mass of of armies that it's kind of not
worth it for any of the big players to
come in and take that over but like just
kind of keep moving around be like a
roving horde of barbarians you know and
bide their time not a tackle each other
like and then when it when the time
comes to strike you know make sure that
they're moving together against the
incumbents you know that's that's the
end of the show thanks for watching guys
see you again next week same bat-time
same bat-channel
bye everybody crazy show do you see the
thumbnail no I still can't look at it
cuz it's still technically live
how's it unlisted
I'm who you know as possible so we've
been doing that because we've been why
would you do that
livestream oh why was that no I don't
know why that was like I knew you could
publish them unlisted I didn't know you
could like start the stream unless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
