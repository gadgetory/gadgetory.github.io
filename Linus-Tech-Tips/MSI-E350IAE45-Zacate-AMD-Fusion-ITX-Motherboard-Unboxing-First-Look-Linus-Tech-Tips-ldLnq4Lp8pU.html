much been talking about since the ati
acquisition this is fusion so let's uh
let's start with who this is from so
this is an MSI products it's the e350
iad 45 this is compatible with Windows 7
it is AMD vision certified it runs HDMI
and apparently comes with Norton which
don't bother installing just download
Windows Microsoft whatever security
essentials okay it's got all solid caps
runs with SATA 6 gigabits per second as
well as USB 3.0 for high-speed
peripherals and internals and it has a
three year warranty and let's see we got
all solid caps this is a military class
motherboard so it should last a long
time
USB safe guard so it has an ESD
protection ship you can rest assured
this day on the safe side with dual
current protection chip pathetic
electricity whatever that is
so you can safely plug in USB things
okay
SATA 6 gig and flash is a cool feature
it allows you to update the BIOS easily
although this has been around for a
while so I suspect they have run out of
things to talk about here alright Volvo
all falling capacitors that's a great
thing this is an MIT X board and it
supports Andy fusion processors ZK
Zuccotti I actually don't know somebody
educate me this is the e350 it has
support for 2 dims for up to ddr3 1066
up to eight gigs max check it out yeah
yeah one PCI Express x16 slot so this
will support full speed graphics cards 8
channel 7.1 audio Gigabit Ethernet 4
SATA 6 gigabits per second parts from
the AMD Hudson m1 as well as 2 USB 3.0
ports 10 USB 2.0 ports and there's an
i/o overview which we won't need because
we are going to open the box
BAM box is open okay so we got a drivers
and utilities DV throw it away download
the latest we got em aside talking about
all their good stuff like Big Bang
fusion military class as well as a quick
installation guide which looks done
folding to above the size of a poster
okay we've got an i/o shield which is
helpfully color-coordinated thanks
and then we've got a couple SATA 6
gigabits per second cables top quality
and stability here's a little manual for
you in a bunch of languages excuse me
guys sorry ok so then in our environment
friendly cardboard packaging we have the
e350 I a 45 itself so this is a very
cool looking board it has on it a
heat-safe and fumble in the middle that
is cooling the apu so what you're gonna
notice immediately about this board if
you're like me you notice these things
it's that it doesn't have a chipset
invisible anywhere on it
so what that means is that either
there's something under that heatsink
which there is ok so that's that's
pretty boring but that chipset is only
handling IO I can tell you guys that
much because the CPU is actually
soldered on to the board includes the
memory controller includes the GPU
include the GPU so this is fusion
finally here and is fully capable of
playing back HD movies and all of that
good stuff you might even get a little
bit of low end gaming going on on a
platform like this and that's pretty
cool so let's start with the overall
layout of the board which is what we
usually do with motherboards here on my
blog we've got our CPU GPU and chipset
all under this massive heatsink massive
compared to the ITX board that it's
taking up about a quarter of the surface
area so it's not really all that big but
then we've got our 4 pin CPU power
connector up here and I have no idea
what the ideal location is on an ITX
board so let's assume that's pretty good
and we've got a couple of headers here
we've got some what look here's to be
three-phase power design okay we've got
our CPU fan plugged in via a three pin
fan header alright we've got two ddr3
slots up to ddr3 1066 and then we have a
really density
see 6 maybe I forget ya do a few 1066
huh there you go okay we've got our
24-pin power over here on the right-hand
side there's our four SATA three six
gigabit per second fourth we got a
couple front USB we've got front panel
audio we've got where are our front
panel connectors hmm where are those it
must be here that must be them
although I'm not a hundred percent sure
no that doesn't look like them where are
they now this is audio this is front
panel sorry guys that's audio that's
front panel okay so here's our PCI
Express 16x connector which I'm a little
bit well though not all that
disappointed to report is not actually
PCIe 16x you can actually see the metal
contacts in here that only goes up to
eight X although eight X is enough for
any graphics card that's going to you'll
be able to be able to overpower the CPU
long before you're gonna run into that
PCIe 8x bottleneck all right here we go
so we got a combo ps2 port big fan of
these we've got one two three four five
six USB 2.0 ports HDMI VGA Gigabit
Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports optical audio
out as well as optical audio out as well
as coaxial audio out and 7.1 audio here
is the CMOS battery which is kind of
glued to the i/o panel for some reason
there's the NEC chipset that's running
our USB 3 ports and gee I guess that's
all there is to really say about it it's
revolutionary actually it doesn't look
like much it just looks like you know
another MITx board a pretty
slick-looking one but this could change
