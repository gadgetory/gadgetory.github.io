all I want to do is write scripts dank
ass jokes for LTT but I've been stuck in
an infinite loop for like a day what if
I told you that there's a way out from
under the iron grip of the bloated
legacy of Billy G why are using that
voice I can show you sure but I must
warn you it's a rabbit hole that you may
never want to climb back out of but you
never explain the voice and if you do
escape you should probably escaped or
sponsors thanks to Joan for sponsoring
this video they're meeting boards help
us prevent double booking in our
conference room and they can help you
too so you don't have to deal with
people poking their heads into your
meetings check them out and use offer
code Linus eight to get eight percent
off
okay so you got me down here why don't
you start by telling me why I should
care about Linux well it's simple really
I can say with confidence that it's the
future gaming that's a pretty bold claim
yeah
but there are huge companies backing it
right now
now you can play steam games in Linux
using valves proton and the number of
games is growing by the day as a result
of that Nvidia has been focusing on
Linux drivers almost as much as Windows
and you want to know the most important
thing hit me
Google's game streaming service stadia
relies on Linux using Vulcan native
Linux versions of the most popular
titles are all but certain at the very
least Windows versions with Vulcan
support which makes protons job that
much easier what's more game developers
see proton as a way to access a whole
new audience of Linux users meaning the
more popular proton becomes with gamers
the more native Linux releases
developers will make I see and you're
gonna talk me through this right I mean
I've never used notes before and I've
heard that it's pretty complicated not
necessarily do you remember how we had
to jump through a lot of Hoops in order
to get our last video on a boon to
gaming up-to-date enough yeah run games
properly uh-huh
well as it turns out there's actually a
bunch of different distros available
where that's not a problem
wait hold on slow down a second I've
heard about a bunch of before but what's
a distro oh right
it's short for distribution and if one
do is just one of them okay you can
think of it like Android some phones get
updates faster than others or come with
their own bundled apps and UI skins the
same with Linux so you can think of a
pun to as being similar to say touch
squids on samsung galaxy phones or
oxygen OS and on one-plus okay
like those Ubuntu is not always the most
up-to-date but it's got a nice enough
interface it's you know pretty popular
some distros on the other hand or a more
elegant and some are more customizable
some have more features other place
emphasis on stability and that kind of
thing so what if I don't like one distro
and I want to choose another one I'm
gonna have to learn everything again
from scratch no just like on Android
where you can download a new launcher if
you don't like the interface on a linux
distro you can just download a new
desktop environment Ubuntu itself as a
distro and these days just uses a
customized version of a just
environment called gnome but if you want
a more Windows like experience there's
k2 e LX cutie and Xfce and if you want a
more Mac like experience there is deepen
Pantheon and budgie all of which feature
high levels of polish you're going to
even has a bunch of different flavours
with that in mind like Ubuntu Xubuntu
and open to budgie and since you can run
them all off of USB Drive you can give
it a test drive without even affecting
your existing operating system so like
if you have Windows it only takes a few
minutes just download the ISO and using
ballina after or Rufus just create a USB
Drive and off you go just one of these
that's pretty sweet
ok so as I said I have heard of a bun
too so since it's the most popular one
that's got to be the best for gaming
right umm yes and no Ubuntu has the
advantage of being ridiculously popular
so most guys will be written with it in
mind the problem is that it went to
ships with old versions of all the
software we're going to need so there
are some hoops to jump through in order
to get the working gaming setup with
that in mind though there are two disk
groves I'd like to bring attention to
today system76 is pop OS and Manjaro pop
OS is based on it boom - so it's able to
take advantage of a good news community
support and it also has more up-to-date
software that Stocki flinty does which
makes it simpler to get up and running
Manjaro on the other hand is not based
on a bun - but something called arch
which is really geared towards more
advanced users and uses what's called a
rolling release cycle which is similar
in concept to stock Android release
cycle this gives us access to even more
recent software plus it even has steam
pre-installed and like a bun - Manjaro
comes in multiple flavors just in case
you like one desktop environment over
another ok so you're saying if I install
them in jar oh I just have steam but if
I go with pop OS then I need to go to
the website and download steam right no
that's where the package manager comes
in
ain't nobody wedding well it's basically
like an app store and it gives you a
list of searchable software that is
gathered from a list of centralized
repositories that you can just download
and install with such a couple clicks
and this gives you automatic updates as
they become available on the repository
and it solves any prerequisites the app
might need so I'm Papa Wes you just open
up the
up shop and searching for steam is there
a lot less overhead with this OS
compared to Windows yes feels so fast
light okay but what if a software I want
isn't even in the store in that case
your next step is to turn to the
community and on a book you base distros
that comes in the form of personal
package archives or PPAs
which can be added in pop shop settings
window under extra sources
meanwhile on Manjaro you'd use the arch
user repository which is a little easier
to set up just enable it and man Jarosz
preferred package manager Pamuk usually
these will give you access to software
that might not have a package available
for your distro for example things like
discord TeamViewer or OBS okay but what
if it's not on either of those then as a
last resort you would turn to the office
website just like on Windows but that's
not really a common problem to have
which is fortunate because it's not as
easy or as clean to install something
you downloaded from the internet on
linux as it is on Windows or Mac OS
you'd be at the mercy of the developer
having good instructions and you'll
probably need to use the terminal like
shown here hold on a second you expect
me to understand all this gibberish no
in many cases it's just a universal way
to rule out an easier installation
experience for people until the software
is available in their package manager
how is this easier and don't be
intimidated you can just copy and paste
if it's a reputable piece of software
there's a little harm in it even if you
don't understand what's happening the
terminal isn't something that needs to
be scary it's just old fashioned feeling
but think of it this way how often have
you been digging through settings trying
to figure out where that one button is
true if you know exactly what you want
your computer to do and that includes
copying these lines it's the fastest and
simplest way to go and by the way this
even applies to Windows and Mac OS two
okay so now with pop OS I normally go to
the pop shop and if it's not there I'd
add a PPA
but if it's not there then I just copy
this stuff and it'll install how much
more do I have to know to play games
actually surprisingly little while it's
not strictly necessary to get everything
working we're primarily focused on
making sure your drivers are up to date
thankfully Manjaro has the
to install them for you in just a few
clicks using the Manjaro settings
manager followed by quick reboot but
Papa less has dedicated versions for AMD
Intel and NVIDIA users with the drivers
already pre-installed no fuss all that's
left for you to do is install a piece of
software called wine via the package
manager that will let us run Windows
programs and ensure all the
prerequisites are installed for our next
important item Lucas which is a game
manager for Linux that can handle games
not supported by Steam logo trying to be
like an egg with a little guy it's a
little harder yeah okay so is it ready
now can i play some games
sure games like rocket League Team
Fortress 2 and the most newer indie
games actually are straight-up available
on steam for Linux without needing any
compatibility layers or special setup so
it just knows that I'm on a Linux PC
units gonna install the right one yeah
sweet yep it's what valve calls Steam
play and I think you'll be surprised at
just how many games are jumping to Linux
it was over 5,000 native Linux games as
of today including many triple-a titles
thanks to porting Studios like feral
interactive and that's not even
including the growing support for proton
just check out the excellent community
around proton DB site and what's more
you can even enable proton for any game
on Steam by going to steam play in
settings and checking a box but if you
want to install games like Starcraft 2
overwatch League of Legends or if you're
big on Good Old Games or humble store
you'll want to use loot hrus which makes
the process dead simple just grab one of
the community made installers from Lucas
net and it does all the work for you
configuring wine setting all the right
variables installing all the support
software all that stuff you used to have
to do manually so why don't you just
take for a spin
all right so I got activities you can go
to that or you can go to Lucas net
either way click on the button where it
says start to glue trace on it and click
install to after install this charge x9
yeah so this is gonna launch battlenet
you might need to still install
Starcraft
but it says play its playable I think
you can launch multiplayer or something
ball-ball xerath oh look at all the
achievements I get just for
logging in it's so great cool so it just
looks like the game are we am I gonna
play do I get paid to play right now how
many actions per minute do you have like
40 this is probably enough I got a
gateway or about you need to construct
more pylons
I have not enough minerals what I like
her iron oh yeah go no this guy's gonna
die for sure I'm not doing anything
that's this let's let's end this now
okay I played a game on Linux your first
game on Linux I did it you said that
there were some hoops that had to be
jumped through but to be clear you don't
have any of that on pop OS or Manjaro
it's just it just all works like we saw
yeah so a bun too is due for an update
like now which might fix some of that
but for pop OS and Manjaro and actually
for a number of other distros we didn't
cover today the steps basically boiled
down to you install the OS install Steam
or Lucas and start playing that's what
make these distros especially enticing
for gamers
but while Manjaro is set up well to
cater to gamers out of the box it's not
going to be as stable as a distro like
Ubuntu and that's why Papa less and
others like it try to bridge that gap
with updated drivers while still
retaining excellent community support
and stable packages which makes them a
good choice for getting your feet wet
okay so what games am i least likely to
be able to play and are there any
gotchas there are a couple of caveats
when it comes to gaming on Linux the
biggest ones are problems with
anti-cheat software and intrusive DRM
schemes and with switchable graphics
like Nvidia Optimus thankfully with
valve and talks with easy anti cheat
there's some hope for resolution on ntp
sometime soon but for switchable
graphics right now Ubuntu based distros
are the only ones that provide any real
support out of the box like pop OS and
the workarounds for other distros aren't
pretty to say nothing of Linux is HDR
support right now which is zero you'll
also lose access to most if not all of
your dedicated RGB lighting controls a
whole hey couple come on take it back
here yeah
hold up there are some standards for
configuring peripherals like ckb next
Piper and Auntie micro can listening
just be prepared for limited support for
external peripherals that rely on custom
software especially for headsets and
less mainstream brands in general but
aside from that you know we keep saying
it but it keeps turning out to be true
getting into Linux is easier than ever
and the rapid pace at which features are
equaling Windows is only going to
accelerate now that Google stadia again
a Linux based platform using Vulcan is
coming and because with proton and
stadia and videos working overtime to
match AMD's already excellent
open-source drivers and wiki's for arch
and a blood two are excellent resources
for learning and troubleshooting plus
the Linux gaming subreddit is huge
thanks for your contributions you guys
you rock and if you take all that
together I mean it looks like we're in
the middle of a renaissance the Volta
2.0 magnetic cable is a sleek 5 amp
charge and sync magnetic cable that
standard USB on one end and then an open
magnet on the other end and they've got
a new reinforced design for all three
tips so you can fit them into almost any
phone case they've got USB type-c Apple
lightning and micro USB the upgraded
connection slot design means it's
OneTouch you've got instant charging and
a nice strong magnetic connection and
it's reversible meaning it can charge in
both directions it's got a new and
improved blue LED light on the side so
you can still see it in the dark but
it's easier on your eyes and no longer
like glares while it's charging and that
five amp capability means that it
supports the new Huawei supercharged -
charge
quick charge 4.0 rapid charge etc etc
it's designed to sustain up to 10,000
plugs and unplugs and it comes with a
lifetime warranty that's true for all
volta products so go check it out
the volta 2.0 features for bold colors
red black silver and blue and they've
got lengths from point 8 feet to
six-and-a-half feet we've got the Amazon
links in the video description
are you that yay well thanks for
watching guys if this video sucks you
know what to do but it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button check out the link to where to
buy the stuffy feet well it's all free
maybe you check out where to buy a flash
drive also linked in description is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join and let us know
how you feel about these writer videos
instead of having Linus here just had
like me and James or you know Alex and
not Jake though no no no large a fire
