anymore we look at them
I don't think Samsung has done anything
visually interesting to their SSD lineup
since they ever so why would we make a
video about the 850 Pro well because
we've got four of them also there's some
really cool technology in them that I
think is worth talking about G skills
new Ripjaws 4 Series is their ultimate
ddr4 memory with speeds of up to three
thousand three hundred and thirty three
megahertz available click now to learn
more
no but seriously this video isn't meant
to be so much a review as a behind the
scenes look at what we're using for the
storage for the server that hosts the
Linus tech tips com community forum and
more importantly why we made that choice
now a huge part of the story here is the
NAND flash the actual storage chips on
the drives the introduction of the 850
Pro marked the first retail availability
of a drive using vertical or 3d end this
comes with a couple of significant
benefits so typically the way that flash
and micro processors get cheaper over
time is that after significant research
and expense clever folks like Intel and
Samsung moved to smaller and smaller
manufacturing processes to allow them to
build the same device with less raw
material or more advanced devices with
the same amount of raw material
increasing performance and lowering
overall costs in the long run the
problem with this is that for flash in
particular as it gets more and more
dense its performance drops and so does
its endurance the number of times it can
be written to before it's not reliable
anymore so for several generations of
SSDs much of the performance and
warranty improvement that we've seen has
been from among other things SSD
manufacturers finding ways of using wear
leveling to cleverly spread the load out
across all the chips in a drive or even
make
the best use of limited flash
performance with really magic like
on-the-fly data compression and
decompression but now here comes
vertical man to the rescue
so by stacking layers instead of
spreading them out two dimensionally
Samsung can achieve the density and
therefore capacity that they need these
are one terabyte drives we're using
while using a bigger manufacturing
process this ends up using nearly the
same raw material in manufacturing but
gives back some of the performance and
reliability that advanced SSD
controllers have been compensating for
over the last few years with the voodoo
magic I mentioned before Samsung then
turns around and pairs this faster more
reliable flash with a modern advance
three core controller and up to a gig a
low-power ddr2 for cache and Lola the a
50 pro is about as fast as a SATA 3 SSD
can be while being rated even at its
lowest capacity to handle 40 gigs per
day of writes for the entire duration of
its 10-year warranty which isn't nearly
as impressive as the 128 gig drive
Samsung says they've had in their lab
for over 8,000 terabytes of writes and
it just keeps going and then I guess on
top of that you also get support for
rapid their SSD acceleration with sort
of Ram cache thing that can be enabled
through the SSD magician' monitoring and
tweaking utility full drive encryption
support and Samsung's easy to use
cloning software so all that out of the
way what are we using these for well
right now in the server
we're running Western Digital re series
enterprise grade hard drives for the
forum software and the database and
we've discovered some interesting issues
especially when we launch giveaways and
contests in spite of cpu load being
quite manageable we've been getting some
weird issues oops okay I put these boxes
here where they'll be safe sort of
background topics so we've discovered
some interesting issues whenever we
launch giveaways and contests in spite
of pretty manageable
cpu load we've been getting some weird
issues with errors during account
creation as people are rushing to make
accounts and during these giveaways and
we narrowed that down to a storage
performance limitation so that is where
the a 50 pros come in starting when
these get deployed the entire line is
tech tips comm site will be solid-state
based we know that while unlike
Samsung's enterprise-grade solutions
these prosumer drives don't offer
end-to-end data protection or power loss
protection but our system uses a battery
backup to protect against unexpected
shutdowns and having data loss due to
that so we're willing to risk using
consumer grade Hardware in order to get
the raw performance and reliability that
we'll get with 850 pros as well as the
capacity and price as sort of balancing
all those things now in the server we'll
be using our four drives responsibly one
will be for the operating system 2 will
be for the database in a raid 1 setup
for protection from hardware failure and
1/4 will be a periodic manual copy from
the raid 1 so actually triple redundancy
but since we had Samsung send the drives
to us to forward to the data center we
figured why not see exactly how much
performance could be extracted from them
if we decided to go crazy and build all
4 terabyte raid 0 array the answer is
well over one gigabyte per second and
here's some crystal disk mark and a s
SSD numbers for the SSD geeks out there
but one thing that disappointed me a
little bit here nothing to do with the
drives is that while they're capable of
much more than this
it looks like intel's on-board RAID
controller is still a bottleneck for
such a high throughput configuration
even on x99 the good news is that for
people running more reasonable two or
three drive raid 0 config intel's raid
driver passes through the trim command
to keep it running at peak efficiency so
aside from the reliability concerns of
raid 0 remember if one drive fails all
the array data is lost it's a somewhat
viable configuration for SSD users that
allows them to overcome the bottleneck
that is the state of 300
face until they bump up against the next
bottleneck in the system at which point
might be time to go MDOT - or SATA
Express or whatever else the case may be
anyway this was fun while it lasted but
it's time to send these to our forum
house so we can start delivering you
guys even better website performance and
if you haven't checked it out already
you guys should head over to Linus tech
tips calm you've got a great community
over there discussing tech and gaming
and all the stuff that goes on on the
internet these days anyway thank you for
watching this video like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you just
liked it leave a comment letting me know
how amazing one terabyte SSDs in row 0
or my face on them or whatever it is
people comment on youtube videos check
out the link in the video description if
you want to support us you can buy a
cool t-shirt like this one give us a
monthly contribution or even just change
your amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate code so whenever you buy a new
SSD we get a small kickback it helps us
out a lot thanks again for watching and
as always don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
