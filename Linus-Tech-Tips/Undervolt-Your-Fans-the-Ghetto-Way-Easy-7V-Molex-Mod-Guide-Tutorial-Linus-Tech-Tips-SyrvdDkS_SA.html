readings of some fans at seven volts
versus at 12 volts in terms of
and we discovered that we don't have a
single 12 to 7 volt resistor in the
entire tech tips to do so because the
rest of the office is closed off right
now I'm forced to make myself a ghetto
one I mean this is one of those never
ever do this but I'm going to show you
how to do it anyway just in case you
ever have to kind of things so basically
you've got a standard 4 pin 2 3 pin
adapter Ollis even going to be able to
plug into all the fans I guess we'll
have to all you got to do is just cut
away the casing anyway
standard 4 pin molex hugs the peripheral
connector to 3 pin so the way that
voltage is derived is from a difference
so yellow carries 12 volt black carries
ground so that will deliver 12 volts to
the fan however if I take okay so a way
to deliver 5 volts to the fan would be
to hook the fan up to this and this or
this and this so this is this carries 5
volts this carries 12 these carry ground
however if I want to deliver 7 volts to
the fan I can hook at the 12 volt up to
the 5 volt and that will be a difference
of 7 volts so I'm going to show you guys
how to do this never ever do this of
course and most importantly once you
plug this in never plug like a hard
drive or anything into this because
it'll be miss wired now because I've
changed these around so all you got to
do if you guys have have ever deep in a
molex before then you'll know how to do
this but you just kind of grab it it's
better to have better tools but I don't
happen to have my tools with me because
we're trying to do something here and we
don't have a whole lot of time so there
we go well apparently the battery is
running out on the camera too so I'll
just work on this while slick goes and
changes the battery and then we'll be
good to go so all you do is bend the
pins in with a needle a little bit so
you Bend those two tabs on either side
of the pin so I'm just going to do this
one really quick here I just need to see
where they are yeah with the camera
there it's pretty hard to see what I'm
doing but it's ok it's all good there we
go ok so you pull that out once you pull
it out you then bend the tabs back out
so that they'll hook back in once you
once you put them back in see how
they're flared now and then the one that
I bent in is not flared anymore so you
just go ahead and
and stick that in there and sort of try
to my needles really dull now because
I've used it for this one awful lot
there you go flare that out flare that
out so yeah I get once again like if you
ever make yourself an adapter like this
I have one at home that I made like what
I did was I wrapped it up like this and
then I like rode on here
7v fan adapter like do not plug and then
if you're really smart you might like
cover this with something so you never
accidentally plug something in so
basically I'm going to take this and
throw them there take this and throw it
in there and now I have made myself see
how I have this now going to what is
essentially 12 volt and 5 volt I've made
myself a Sevenfold fan adapter which you
should never do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
