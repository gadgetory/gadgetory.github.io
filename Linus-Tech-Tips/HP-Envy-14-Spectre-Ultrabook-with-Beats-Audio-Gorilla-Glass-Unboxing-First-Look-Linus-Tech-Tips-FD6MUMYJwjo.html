that's actually pretty exciting now I
have to confess this is a bit of a hack
because this has been unboxed clearly
before also this is a French model so
for those English folks in the in the
audience this might be a little bit oh
no this is well this is English I think
on the inner carton it's French okay so
fourteen inch diagonal radiance 850 plus
infinity LED display so this is a 1600
by 900 display on a 14-inch model which
means you've got pretty good pixel
density 128 gig MCO solid-state drive
although you can get with the 256 4 gigs
of ram only one Ram slot so you're
pretty much limited to 4 gigs of ram
although this is sort of an ultrabook
style form factor so you it's not really
intended for heavy usage wireless LAN
bluetooth second generation Core i5 the
dual-core processor at 1.6 gigahertz
genuine Windows 7 home premium and let's
get this baby opened up so this is meant
to compete directly wrong let's not say
compete directly this is meant to
capture the customers who want a
beautiful premium notebook and just
aren't interested in OS 10 because or 11
are we up to 11 now I don't know
whatever whatever Apple's OS is who
cares cuz it sucks right although no
offense to the Apple users out there
it's just every time I sit down in front
of an Apple OS and try to do something
actually safe for iOS I can handle iOS I
just like horribly break it within a
matter of seconds so here's a little
diagram in English and French this is a
bilingual model of all of the stuff so
we're gonna save that because that is a
pretty handy reference for people who do
unboxings here is a cool little neoprene
case that it comes in to keep it from
getting scratched and damaged although
that's less of a factor than you might
think because this whole notebook yes
the entire top and I'm sorry see it has
fingerprints on it already because it's
totally been unboxed before and there we
go we'll just fix that this whole
notebook top and screen if I could turn
it around the right way talk
and screen is done in gorilla glass so
that means this is one of the most
scratch resistant notebooks you will
pretty much ever encounter so you can
see here we've got an aluminum sort of
the looking defect
sorry aluminum sort of looking me finish
although it is made of plastic on the
main part of the shell down here below
so this again is plastic as well but
it's feels very very solid and one of
the reasons for that is probably the
fact that it has more glass so there's
actually another piece of Gorilla Glass
right here and what I like about this is
on so many notebooks you go to use the
thing you know it looks great the first
time you use it but then after a little
while you get these horrible ugly like
palm prints under the keyboard that just
look disgusting and awful and there's no
getting rid of them however if you put
glass there as well as glass here almost
all of the usable surfaces of this
entire notebook are going to be
completely impervious to just incidental
damage especially given that they're
made of Gorilla Glass there's also a
couple little notes here thank you for
selecting HP Envy got a bit about your
support there so what's cool about the
support for this particular models it
has a two year warranty and it's
actually what you do is you basically
call HP support and if there's anything
they can't solve for you over the phone
then they will ship you something that
you need next day so very very cool
comes with a travel adapter as well as
AC to DC adapter which hey check that
out also includes a little USB auxiliary
doodad so that means that you can charge
your phone at the same time off the same
charger just by having your laptop
plugged in without actually plugging the
phone directly into the laptop I don't
know maybe more or less of a concern to
you depending on whether you have a
phone or not let's go back to the
notebook so let's talk about the
external first so this part is
definitely aluminum and then you can see
it is kind of a sandwich aluminum rimmed
two pieces of glass thing and you know
what yeah this is totally appropriate in
this case so whether you guys like it or
not we are totally whipping out the
iPhone compared
and so you can see the screen here is
actually about as thick as just the
aluminum portion of the iPhone which is
it looks just beautiful guys we've got a
litte HP logo right here and I'm trying
not to catch them slick in the
reflection here but I don't know if
there's much that I can do very very
black looking and then on this side
what's cool about the LED backlit 1600
by 900 screen here is that HP has
actually gone with a super slim bezel
design that allowed them to put a
14-inch display in what would normally
be a 13.3 inch notebook form factor so
you get a bigger screen as well as that
high pixel density which means that you
can do more on the PC now you do have
that additional glare that comes with
using a glass screen personally I love
having glass in front of a panel that's
my number one choice followed shortly by
Matt screens followed very distantly by
shiny plastic screens I think the glass
adds a lot of vibrance it adds crispness
personally I like it not everyone does I
think it's fantastic and if I could
upgrade my personal monitor to a glass
screen monitor then I would love to but
I'm waiting for someone to do a
beautiful 30-inch glass panel monitor
which hasn't happened yet okay so here
we have a backlit keyboard as you can
see this is a bilingual layout however
if you were to buy this in the US then
you would not see the bilingual layout
as far as bilingual layouts go they
haven't they haven't butchered it too
badly
sometimes you see bilingual layouts that
make it impossible to hit anything but
you know both your shift keys are
somewhat intact the enter key I always
like seeing the bigger entry key but
there's not a whole lot we can do about
it it's Canadian law and such and I
don't know what this does what this does
okay you know what let's go into some of
the other some of the other features
here so cool senses come and eat what
cool sense does is it's basically a
temperature controlled fan which isn't
rocket science we've been seeing this on
the PC side on the desktop for a long
time but on a notebook what's kind of
neat about it is that it keeps your
problems from getting hot so that's the
way that they've tuned it is so that as
soon as the laptop starts to get hot
enough that your palms would get that
heat and sweatiness factor going on it
kicks in the fan so that's kind of neat
it also comes with two years of Norton
Internet Security so whatever you may or
may not think about Norton
it comes with two years as opposed to
like you know the stupid 30-day trial
that insists upon being installed and it
takes forever to remove it also comes
with full copies of Adobe Premiere
Elements and Adobe Photoshop Elements
which is like a compelling value add
because if you price those pieces of
software out they are not cheap and they
are significantly more functional than
the ones that are included with Windows
I mean what like paint and Windows Movie
Maker like they're not even in the same
kind of yeah whatever okay moving on we
have DisplayPort out HDMI out Ethernet
check that out full sized rj45 how
innovative a solution is that so they've
managed to maintain a slimmer than rj45
form factor just using this little hinge
right here to allow you to fit in your
Ethernet port
we've got no they haven't
color-coded their USB sorry okay so this
guy is USB 3 this guy is USB 2 you can
tell from how many pins are inside
here's a microphone out SD card reader
on the front we got a little beats logo
yes this is one of HP's beats notebooks
and I will explain more about that on
the other side we have a mute button we
have a volume switch so this is meant to
be fine control volume switch you can
see it actually spins an awful lot Wow
am I still spinning this yeah I'm still
spinning it huh okay check it out
there's a little animated thing on the
screen we it spins when I spin the dial
cool that's this nice little touches
this is also another audio control
button so what this guy does is you
press the button and it comes up with a
little oh my wait for it yes comes up
with a little you know thing that you
could also access if you right clicked
and went to playback devices and
recording devices down in the system
tray but here it is all in one nice
little sort of menu for you we've also
got our power in over here and that
pretty much does it I mean you don't get
a ton of Io on these super slim
notebooks here we have our ventilation
at the back as well as four rubber feet
for the whole thing to sit on the
battery is big so this is to release the
battery and
we're not going to release the battery
since we're running off battery right
now but we've also got speakers here at
the front that's pretty much it if we're
missing anything so oh yeah it supports
WiDi
it also supports wireless audio so with
supported devices you can actually not
just bluetooth but with supported
wireless headphone devices you can
actually just stream directly to them to
do full size pores then bezel backlit
keyboard
oh yeah the keyboard detects your
presence so I haven't actually tested
this but in theory when you go away from
it for a while and then you walk up to
it the the backlight actually actually
turns on so that's that's just sort of
one of those things that's kind of kind
of neat ah yes the robust hinge so the
difference between cheap notebooks I
mean I know we went over sort of the
speeds and everything of this notebooks
very briefly however that's not
necessarily all there is to it build
quality is huge
so not all notebooks you can take the
hinge and go like this and not worry
about something bad happening so between
the SSD inside and the robust design of
the hinge HP was very comfortable with
me doing this demo on this notebook
because build quality does mean
something so the glass screen the robot
hinge the keyboard that has almost no
flex to it whatsoever that's one of the
marks of the build quality of a notebook
walk up to it in the store and go like
this like this go like this go like this
on the keyboard and see how much flex
there is to it if there's a lot of flex
I guarantee you it's a cheap plastic
shell versus being a higher quality
shell I think that pretty much covers it
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and I hope you
guys have enjoyed this one about the
beats and the spectre now there is a
Spectre XT which is a lower end model if
you're buying a Spectre I would
definitely recommend going with this one
because it comes with the scratch
resistant Gorilla Glass as well as just
being generally a very very sleek
looking little notebook slick wanted to
show the battery and that was a good
idea actually so we just triggered these
take this off and here's the battery so
HP quotes a nine hour battery life on
this on this model if I recall correctly
and you can see why because the on the
internals here look look look at this
see those how the battery goes all the
way down to the bottom almost half of
the internals of this whole whole
notebook are the battery so that's what
keeps that Intel dual core running for
such an extended period of time in spite
of the very very slim form factor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
