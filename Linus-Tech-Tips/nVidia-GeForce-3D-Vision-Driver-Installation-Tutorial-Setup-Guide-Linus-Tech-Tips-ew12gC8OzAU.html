on how to install your nvidia geforce
drivers today i'm going to be doing a
quick little guide on how to set up
nvidia stereoscopic 3d so the first
thing I'm going to do is adjust my white
balance so you're actually going to be
able to read dialog boxes that are on
the screen aha there we go okay so the
first thing you've got here is the
Nvidia control panel so we're going to
go into the Nvidia control panel and
we're going to discover something when
it loads yeah we are going to discover
that I do not actually have any options
in here at all for 3d vision or
stereoscopic 3d is what it would be
under so the default drivers from Nvidia
actually do not include 3d vision
drivers because I mean the reality of it
is 99% of people don't need it so you go
to Nvidia comm make sure you're always
downloading the latest drivers for 3d
vision because it is quite complicated
and they are making updates as often as
they can so we select Windows 7 64 bit
the same procedure as with your driver
installation search and download it's a
300 megabyte full driver CD package and
since I've already downloaded it I'm
going to go ahead and just read it so
yes I would like to run that particular
program go ahead and install the 3d
vision driver so we click Next
I do not need the stereoscopic 3d viewer
personally but if you want it by all
means okay so it only takes a little
while to install actually and then the
configuration process is quite simple
first of all you need to be wearing your
I'm gonna just turn this thing you need
to be wearing your 3d vision glasses
okay next you need to make sure that
your IR emitter is plugged in via USB to
the back of your computer so you should
see a dim green light and I'm going to
show you the difference so okay go ahead
finish okay yeah alright so now we go
into the Nvidia control panel again and
there's going to be an option that we
didn't have before oh yeah your glasses
should also be charged
rectify USB and the power button is here
so they should be charged and on so we
do not have an option for out here it is
setup stereoscopic 3d so go ahead and
click there and then we're going to use
the setup wizard because just clicking
enable stereoscopic 3d might not
configure everything properly I don't
know I haven't tried but the wizard
takes only a couple minutes to run and
walks you through some of the stuff that
you need to know about 3d vision before
you use it so first of all it gives you
a little checklist for all the things
that you need to do for either 3d vision
or 3d vision discover which is a red
blue and anaglyphic yeah I think it's
anaglyphic anyway either way it's red
blue lens system rather than the active
shutter glasses so we go ahead and click
Next
okay this shows us how to connect the IR
emitter which i've already connected USB
to the back of the computer it's quite
straightforward
okay we click Next and then you select
the kind of gaming configuration that
you'll be using
so single gaming computer in a room
running 3d vision where there are not
other consumer IR devices such as TV
remote control at the same time okay
then you've got if you've got other
interfering things in the room and then
there's also multiple gaming computers
in Al and gaming environment all running
3d vision so that's where there would be
a ton of interference because the IR
emitter is actually just blasting out IR
signals that tell the the shutter
glasses when to when to shut off when to
when to blank the frame for one eye
versus the other ok so the next step now
yeah you can't tell but my glasses have
actually gone quite dark so this is the
step where the glasses turn on so I'm
going to go ahead and let you look
through the lens you see how dark the
screen is compared to there it's because
it's blocking out every other frame the
monitor is running at its full 120 Hertz
it is a 3d vision ready monitor I hope I
mentioned that you need one of those and
so press the on button look for a steady
green light on the glasses as well as on
the iron meter so that's the bright
green light
that I didn't show you before and
there's no study green light on those
for whatever reason but they're on trust
me they're on ok so I'm going to go
ahead and put these back on ok so now
that that's all figured out our glasses
are on the emitter is on we are seeing
the images dark this one so if I look
close you see you can see both a green
hexagon and a blue triangle but I'm
going to show you something interesting
if you look through the right lens you
see only a blue triangle if you look
through the left lens you see only a
green hexagon so this is how 3d vision
works there you can see both of them so
it's blocking every other frame so on
the monitor every other frame is
displaying that green hexagon and every
other frame is displaying the blue
triangle so it's blocking it so my left
eye sees the left image my right eye
sees the right image so for this part it
says looks for the right eye with the
left eye closed so we do that ok select
what you see we see a blue triangle if
you look through the left eye with the
right eye closed we see a green hexagon
so I'm going to go ahead and select
those options blue triangle green
hexagon excellent this one do I notice a
flicker in your peripheral vision ok
this helps you configure it if you if
you're in a European area where they
have 50 Hertz power or a variety about
the things so no I do not notice a
flicker in my peripheral vision I go
ahead and click next this is the last
one verify that you are able to do
stereoscopic 3d contents so here I'm
going to show you something interesting
to select which of the following you see
one with a box popping out or one
without a box popping out right now you
see one without a box popping out but
let's see what happens if we do this
yeah that's not going to work ok hold on
if I hold these far enough away will I
be able to see the box at all this might
be tricky
hold on ok so what I need is I need the
glasses as close as possible to where
the box pops I know this isn't going to
work ok well you're gonna have to trust
me then I can see it this way right here
also I have read and understand the
health and safety information this is
one of the reasons I would definitely
recommend running the wizard so that you
can make sure that you read
understand that I click next and then
that's it I don't want to create a
shortcut for that I don't want to launch
a slideshow of 3d games and you click
finish so once that's done you can see
that the Nvidia control panel has gone
ahead and configured itself you can you
can change the maximum depth you can
also do that with the slider wheel on
the back of the IR emitter when you're
in game so you don't have to change the
the maximum depth on the driver level
you can set your keyboard shortcuts and
you can test scary stereoscopic 3d it
launches this horrible horrible thing
and I'll show you this is so old here
it's pretty funny actually
it's the Nvidia logo popping out at you
it actually looks kind of funky on one
monitor but when you stretch this thing
over three monitors it's just just
horrible this pink and yellow and black
and gray thing anyway 3d vision is
working on the system thank you for
checking out my 3d vision setup guide
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips
oh yeah last thing make sure you have a
video card that supports 3d vision
here's your first hint if you're running
one of these it does not support 3d
vision ATI currently does not have a
stereoscopic 3d technology so you must
be using an Nvidia card 8800 series or
higher in order to take advantage of the
3d vision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
