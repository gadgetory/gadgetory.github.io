of the msi gtx 560 that's it
no Ti so this is a 5/16 on Ti it
features their twin frozer 2 cooler it
is an OC Edition card so it has the well
it has some justification for the Twin
Frozr cooler because they have turned up
the clock speeds it features their
military class 2 concept which means
using higher quality components in order
to increase longevity increase
overclocking all that good stuff it's
only 30 decibels under full load as MSI
says and I believe that between froze
artoo is an excellent cooler I just
think it's awesome alright we've got a
three year warranty in the US and Canada
and Mexico don't know where else the
warranties apply or don't apply ok it is
3d vision ready features physics cuda
nvidia sli up to 2-way SLI on this
particular GPU and it has full support
for MSI Afterburner
you also get a copy of Lara Croft and
The Guardian of Light this is a steam
copy so it's quite easy to activate
alright
opening this up you can see a little bit
more information about exactly the stuff
that I just said and I'm pretty familiar
with the twin throws are two cooler so I
think I can go in blind on that one what
I would seeing what MSI has to say for
themselves so the GTX 560 90 I so this
is just a slightly cut-down card with
the same basic GPU so the performance is
close but not quite what you're going to
get out of the GTX 560 Ti fully fledged
card but it's cheaper so there you go
features not features comes with a mini
HDMI to HDMI adaptor a DVI to VGA
adapter a quick user's guide some
useless discs
there's your Lara Croft game as well as
your driver update guide alright so go
ahead and put this back in
put this back in and let's have a look
at the product itself here oh no no more
accessories so dual molex to single 6
pin PCI II connectors two of them and
finally the prime itself comes in an
anti-static a Twin Frozr - cooler hasn't
changed much you know what and give me
two seconds I'm gonna grab about 560 Ti
yeah I forgot my 560 Twin Frozr - 560 GI
Twin Frozr - and I'd be careful with
that from now on my 560 ti twin brother
- is part of the prize system I'm giving
away so it's upstairs I'm not gonna go
get it but this is a GTX 460 Hawk and it
uses the same PCB as the 560 TI Twin
Frozr - so you can see that it also uses
the same PCB you can see the hawk is
actually covered up right here as the
gtx 560 Twin Frozr - so there's no real
changes in terms of the physical layout
of this board but I'm gonna walk you
through it anyway we've got a couple of
92 millimeter low-profile fans so this
allows MSI to maintain a two slot
profile while putting in a dual fan
custom cooled cooler solution alright
we've got two super pipes so here's your
two regular heat pipes in the middle of
the GPU and the two super pipes are
going out further away from the GPU
because they do need to carry heat a
little bit more efficiently because they
are going over a greater distance you've
got your standard PCIe 16x interface
down here as well as what the heck is
this this looks like it's got a couple
purposes okay so that's something new
all right so you can see on the GTX 460
here there's nothing here
and on the gtx 560 Twin Frozr - there is
a heap sync here so that would be for
the the voltage regulators so I guess
MSI has just beefed up the design a
little bit here and it looks like it's
also gonna provide some additional yeah
here if you look at it from this side
you can see it actually wraps around the
end of the PCB and if that should
provide some stiffness to the card as
well and that won't be the only thing
that provides stiffness to the card so
you can see up here
they're using their PCB stiffener
actually they have a name for this but
I've just forgotten and it looks like
they haven't included it on the on the
box either which makes my life more
difficult but basically what it is is
it's a piece of metal that allows the
card to be more rigid overall so you
can't you can't really flex the piece of
you know what why don't we compare it
against the 460 so here you can see how
much flex there isn't it right okay
so let's compare that to the 460 I'll
hold that the same way and I'm just
gonna pinch it the same way so you can
see how that PCB can flex quite a bit
more now especially if you're moving
your system around or shipping it
remember it's only secured by the PCIe
slot and by the two screws up here so if
the card is not very stiff over here
there can be a lot of a lot of movement
which can cause it to I mean I've even
heard of cards in shipping mind you
before they use two spring mounted
screws on the backs of video cards this
is why everyone started doing it where
the coolers actually coming off from
vibration and from movement it can also
cause undue strain on the PCIe slot and
on the screws if you don't have that
stiffening piece there so that's that's
one thing that they have added to this
card versus the 460 we've got dual 6 pin
PCI II connectors on the back of the
card so it should have support for
almost any power supply any modern power
supply should be able to run this card
just fine here's your 4 pin PWM fan
control at the top of the board you do
find your sli bridge connector so there
is just one which means two-way SLI not
3-way SLI the back of the card looks
pretty much like we've come to expect
from anything using this particular PCB
you guys are welcome to look for them if
you want but I suspect you will not find
any differences between the appearance
of the 460 Hawke and the GTX Twin Frozr
- 560 GTX Twin Frozr these these names
are getting very confusing I have to
confess alright on the back of the card
you find dual DVI if I can ever get this
connector plug cover thing off as well
as mini HDMI so that's why you have that
adapter now about the Twin Frozr -
cooler you can see here there are some
vent holes so you're going to have a
little bit of heat
expelled outside of the case but most of
it is going to be expelled inside the
case so there's always compromises to be
made and the compromise MSI has made as
they have opted for lower overall G tech
GPU temperatures which should result in
better overclocking at the buy and
sacrificing the overall case
temperatures a little bit so you want to
make sure you got a decently ventilated
case with good cooling fans and you
shouldn't run into any problems thank

gtx 560 non TI don't forget to subscribe
