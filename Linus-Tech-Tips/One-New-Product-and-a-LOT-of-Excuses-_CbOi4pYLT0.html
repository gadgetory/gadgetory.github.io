2016 is brought to you by the Corsair
lapdog
the portable gaming control center that
lets use a full-size Mouse and
mechanical gaming keyboard on your couch
as well as MSI so here we are in the NOC
to a booth where they are showing off a
product that has been three years in the
making this my friends is the unnamed
unlabeled successor to the NFF 12 fan
and we don't know much about it other
than that it is a balanced blade design
so they're saying it's going to be
perfect for radiators and heat Singh's
and that it has been an absolute bitch
to manufacture and the reason for that
is that in order to achieve the few
things so the airflow noise and
reliability that they're going for they
needed point five millimeters of
clearance between the blades and the
outside of the frame the problem with
that and are my friends it knocked to us
that this was news to them to is that
fans as they spin over time actually
flatten out so in their reliability
testing the blades were hitting the damn
frame so it has been a complete
nightmare to get the tolerances close
enough to have a true successor to the
NFF 12 but they say they're close so
hopefully it's happening pretty soon
what they also have here is a way of
improving the look of your existing
knock to a heatsink
so this doesn't look like it normally
would know these are chrome ax covers so
they're kind of these stealth metal
covers that you can put over top of your
existing NHD 15 or your existing Nhu 12s
and they've got a couple of different
variants they're showing off they've got
a plain one and one that it looks like
will be a bit more expensive with these
little colored arrows that show through
and that will ship with all of the
chrome ax colors in the box so you can
swap them out as you wish well hold on a
second line is I don't want a shroud for
my heatsink Noctua hasn't released a
heatsink like a performance heatsink in
a million years what did they do to sit
on ass all day and the answer as far as
I can tell is yes yes they do no just
kidding while they didn't bring any
actual upcoming product they did bring a
lot of excuses
so these are five prototypes of
different fin designs some that we've
seen from knocked to his competitors
elsewhere in the market that basically
demonstrate that yes we are looking into
it but there's a variety of reasons to
do with boundary layers and free
streaming air and the speed of the air
right next to the fin being
significantly slower than further away
from the fin which hurts thermal
transfer in blah blah blah we're trying
all these things but the truth is
compared to a flat fin they just don't
work that well so in theory copper
aluminum composite fins would help to
spread out the heat more and would allow
you to solder the fins directly to the
heat pipes saving that nickel layer that
would be on well a thermal barrier in
practice it's very much more expensive
and makes pretty much no difference
we're talking point one of a degree
they've also got an offset split fin
design that breaks up that boundary
layer halfway through each of the
heatsink layers again the actual back
flow from this design as well as this
scoop so kind of like what you would put
on the hood of your car this flow duct
scoop design creates a situation where
you actually have to throw so much more
rpm at the problem that yes you're
getting more performance but you're also
ending up with an oyster product which
as you guys are probably aware not to us
not really that down for this guy right
here they actually had a lot of hope for
this is oblique groove patterns and has
to do with kind of when the air gets
sucked into a groove it exits at a
higher velocity and they figured maybe
that would help but nothing conclusive
so far
and finally little you know golf ball
type indentations and I think you've
pretty much got the story so far so
there you have it they have a better fan
that they're finally bringing to us and
that may actually if they can figure out
how to make this one signal the solution
to the problem with that active noise
cancellation when I showed you guys two
years ago and a bunch of excuses so
thanks again to Corsair for sponsoring
our trip to Computex 2016 make sure you
check out the lap dog at the link in the
video description and thanks to msi as
well who's showing off their Aegis X
desktop here at the show as well as
their GT X 1080 gaming x 8g got that
linked in the video description as well
don't miss any of our Computex coverage
by making sure you're subscribed to
Linus tech tips
hopefully know where that button is and
I will see you guys again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
