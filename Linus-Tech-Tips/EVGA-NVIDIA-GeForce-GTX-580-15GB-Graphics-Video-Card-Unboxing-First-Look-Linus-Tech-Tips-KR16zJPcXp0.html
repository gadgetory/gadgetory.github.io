very exciting product this is the EVGA
GeForce GTX 580 that is 100 more than
the 480 it's actually not a hundred more
because it's difficult to quantify a
graphics part in terms of a numerical
value other than well I guess FPS but
there's features to bear that in mind so
let's get this guy out of his packaging
and have a look so this is the latest
and greatest from Nvidia this is
actually the replacement for the
relatively short-lived GTX 480 and I
guess you could say it's more of an
evolutionary change than a revolutionary
change because we do have still a very
similar feature set so we've got support
for two-way SLI 3-way SLI DirectX 11
physics 3d vision surround we have 1.5
gigs of graphics memory so stop me if
any of that sounds familiar
but one of the big improvements that
were making with this card over the GTX
480 is the fact that we've improved the
power consumption okay so that is less
power consumption we've improved the
heat output that is less heat output and
we've also improved the performance so
that is more performance so it's what
the GTX 480 is except better better and
better in every way so here is an
overall key feature list 2-way 3-way and
fired pardon me 4 Way SLI is also
supported on select motherboards we've
got full support for NVIDIA --zz CUDA
initiative that is using your graphics
card to do complex computational
equations such as folding at home or
video rendering alright here we have a
little note about connecting your GTX
580 to the power supply next we have a
graphics card user guide ok
probably this feels very short as well
as a QuickStart guide all right there we
go
shows you how to plug in your power
shows you where the SLI connector is
well we don't need to look at this
because we have a real card to look at
next we've got an EVGA driver slash
software installation disk as well as a
powered by EVGA sticker so throw that
away download latest off the Nvidia
website you've heard me say that before
and let's have a look at the accessories
that are included with this card so
first of all we have a dual molex to
6-pin PCI Express connector next we have
a dual 6 pin PCI Express connector to
PCI Express 8 pin connector finally we
have a mini HDMI to HDMI connector and
then we have a DVI to VGA connector so
with all of the adapters that are
included you could theoretically be
running this off some ancient power
supply that doesn't have proper support
for it on some ancient VGA monitor that
probably doesn't deserve such a great
graphics card powering it but I'm sure
most of you are gonna be running this
with the recommended power supply which
actually whoops oh I'm sorry here let's
check this out so it looks like this
card actually comes with an EVGA poster
check that out EVGA gaming whoa look at
that VGA gaming comm I can't actually
quite tell that this is a picture of but
it's a skull and then there appears to
be like some car parts attached to it oh
it's some kind of like robotic thing
with a skull on the top of it either way
that's pretty cool so you get a poster
with your video card you know alright no
put that away actually here why don't we
do why don't we do a quick contest
around this poster so I want you guys to
let me see I'll come up with something
arbitrary like I want you to tell me
what you would name that skeleton guy
and whatever name I like the best I will
send you the poster done alright
so that's actually right I wanted to
check out the minimum system
requirements in terms of power supply so
here so EVGA is recommending a 600 watt
or greater power supply with a minimum
of 42 amps on the 12 volt rail
okay and other than that it's all fairly
fairly standard stuff and let's just
have a look at what else we had on here
oh right yeah EVGA does some bragging on
the outside of this box which I also
wanted to talk about and so they should
number one seller of Nvidia based
products in the US number one and
reliability and service and that is in a
survey that was conducted in 2010 number
one performance leader in 3dmark Vantage
as well as the number one folding at
home team in the world those are
certainly some points that are worth
bragging about
so now let's have a look at the GTX 580
itself this isn't a reference card so
that means that EVGA has customized the
look and feel of the card itself and
probably not much else although EVGA
does have many custom cards that they do
where they use different coolers or they
actually overclock the stock frequency
of the card
past what Nvidia specification is and
they'll give you a lifetime warranty on
that as well that's one of the other
really cool things about EVGA is their
lifetime warranty so let's do a quick
tour of the card first of all we've got
our fan here so that fan spins blows the
air at the back of your case this is a
rear exhaust design on this card so that
means that you're not going to have to
worry about the heat being expelled into
your case and then having to use hot air
to cool the card itself although we are
gonna lose a little bit of it at the top
here that's probably to decrease the
restriction of the cooling mechanism so
that we can yeah we can exhaust some out
here if we absolutely have to and same
goes down at the bottom we have a
standard sorry about that guys battery
died so standard PCI Express 2.0 16x
slot let's move around let's see if
there's anything else interesting on the
bottom of the card it doesn't really
look like it so let's move around to the
back of the card so here you can see the
GF 110 that is the code name of the GPU
that powers the GTX 580 so that's where
it's mounted on the PCB you can see the
power delivery system is all over on
this side you can also see where the
memory modules are mounted around the
outside of the GPU so that you got nice
short PCB traces so it communicate can
communicate very quickly with that
memory here is the two sli connectors
that are required for our 2-way you only
need one
anyway as well as four-way SLI and last
but not least let's have a look at the
top of the card where we have our PCI
Express 6 pin as well as our PCI Express
8 pin power connectors and then let's
move around to the back where finally we
have two DVI outputs as well as that one
mini HDMI which EVGA kindly provides a
mini HDMI to standard HDMI output so you
can make proper use of it so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the GTX
580 don't forget to check out my other

GPU from Nvidia and don't forget to
