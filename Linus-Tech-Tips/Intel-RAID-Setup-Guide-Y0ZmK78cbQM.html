check the link in the video description
for more details welcome to our raid
setup guide this one is sponsored by a
data so they actually provided us with
some SSDs to show off the setup
procedure for raid arrays on an Intel
chipset motherboard so in this case
we're using the Maximus 6 extreme from a
soos and we're going to walk you through
everything from start to finish
although very briefly the types of raid
that are generally supported by a
motherboard are going to be raid 0 which
is better for speed but actually worse
than single drive operation for
reliability raid 1 which doesn't do
anything to speed but is much better for
reliability but costs more per capacity
because you're doubling up the number of
drives you need for a given amount of
storage and raid 5 which I generally
don't really recommend running off of an
on-board RAID controller because the
performance isn't great and migrating
from one motherboard to another one can
be a bit of an issue in terms of well
the data staying you know there alright
so the first step is to press Delete or
F 2 or F 11 or whatever it happens to be
on your motherboard to get into the BIOS
you can see we already have this set up
so because we were cheating and we made
sure we knew how to set up a raid array
before we started filming this what
you're going to want to do is get into
the SATA it's usually under chipset or
something like that so say the
configuration sometimes there will be
multiple SATA chipsets on your
motherboard you can consult the manual
or they're often labeled physically but
you want to make sure all the drives
that you want to run in right read are
connected to the same physical
controller and I usually recommend using
the Intel one unless there's a
compelling reason not to or on an AMD
motherboard the AMD one obviously
so the SATA mode selection there's
usually IDE hcin raid so that should be
pretty self-explanatory go with raid
then eff tend to commit our changes and
restart the computer now when you boot
up you're going to see an additional
option that you didn't have before if
you weren't in RAID mode and it's going
to say press control I to enter the
configuration outlet hurt utility so
from here you
create raid volumes de leeuw trade
volumes please note when you delete a
raid volume you do wipe out all the data
on those drives so be very careful with
that in fact when you create a raid
volume you wipe out all the data on
those drives you can reset disks
non-raid etcetera etc etc so we are
going to show you creating a raid volume
so in our case we're going to call it OS
because the only reason I can think of
to build a very high-performance massive
raid zero would be for an OS that you're
not planning to store anything critical
on and you're going to do like nightly
or even hourly backups because that is a
very very scary way to run your computer
I would know because I do it and I've
had quite a few problems with that so
you go down through these options when
you select the drives use spacebar to
select the ones you want to use and it
will actually only give you the raid
options that make sense for how many
drives that you have selected so raid 5
won't show up until you select at least
three drives and raid ten won't show up
unless you select at least four drives
when you're done press ENTER and it
gives you an option for strip size so
generally speaking is smaller strip
sizes that is to say how much data is
written to each of the however many
drives are in the raid zero before
moving on to the next one smaller strip
sizes are generally better for random
and larger strip sizes are generally
better for sequential performance
however your mileage may vary and it
depends a lot on the kind of drives
you're running and the kind of data
you're working with so we're just going
to go with the default option which I
believe was 32 although it doesn't
matter we're not going to use this for
anything capacity you can adjust the
capacity you want we're going to go with
the full capacity of our drives which is
in there automatically create volume all
data will be lost yes we're okay with
that once this is done all we have to do
is press escape to exit and we're ready
to install our operating system on ACS
motherboards we can press f8 to bring up
the entire boot menu without actually
manually reconfiguring our boot devices
there you go
just keep mashing it on other boards
it's different I believe it's f eleven
on gigabyte boards for example so now
all we have to do is go to our amasian
clip which is our Windows OS so you
would use your disk drive if you had a
Windows disk in the optical drive for
example but in our case it's a bootable
USB so we're going to load this up and
show you the last step here so it should
show up as unallocated space
if for whatever reason your array does
not show up here what you're going to
want to do is click load driver and then
you're going to insert either a USB
Drive make sure you plug it into a USB 2
port not a USB 3 port because that will
need drivers in order to function as
well so you're going to want to throw it
on a USB Drive or on an optical disk
click browse find the driver and install
that but in this case we don't need it
because we're just using the onboard
Intel raid so we're going to go ahead
and just click Next unless we
particularly
need to make a bunch of different
partitions out of our drive it does not
improve performance in any meaningful
way contrary to what you might have been
told in 1998 so there you go we're going
to go ahead and do that okay one thing
you can do is you can short-stroke
drives or you can leave extra spare area
on SSDs but you don't want to just
create a bunch of random partitions for
no reason unless you really really
absolutely your need to do ok we're done
now so basically there you go guys that
is how to set up a raid array whether
it's raid 0 which is what we did or raid
1 or raid 5 or whatever else the case
may be running off of an Intel RAID
controller built into your motherboard
