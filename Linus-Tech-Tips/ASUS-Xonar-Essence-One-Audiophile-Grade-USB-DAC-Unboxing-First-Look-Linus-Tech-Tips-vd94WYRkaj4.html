is honestly a little bit outside the
scope of my expertise let me start by
saying I love good sounding audio
whether it's music movies or games but
this is a in a completely different
class from anything that I have
experienced before this is the zone our
essence one USB DAC and headphone
amplifier it is according to a soos the
world's first 8x symmetrical upsampling
DAC and we're going to go ahead we're
going to flip it around I'm just going
to be doing a very very high level sort
of coverage of exactly what this thing
is and why you might care and then we're
going to be following this up on my NCIX
palm channel with a more detailed look
at exactly what it is and why it's so
special so this is the the zone are sort
of symbol that the tiger that is sort of
representing according to a Seuss the
mankind's the endless pursuit of the
essence of sound and also zone or
essence STX is commitment to offer the
best quality ever from an audio card so
that is what a soos believes they've
done here this is your ultimate deck
solution Xtreme audio clarity with 120
decibel sound to noise ratio the
difference between this and other 120
decibel sound the noise ratio devices
we've seen in the past as this one has
the testing to back it up so I would
actually believe it it has a built-in
headphone amp which powers up to audio
file class headphones that is up to 600
ohm impedance headphones no big deal
right
user customizable tone characters with
11 swappable op amps so two of those are
on the headphones and the others are not
so you can change completely the way
that the DAC sounds just by changing out
to different op amps cleanest sound
thanks to dedicated internal power
supply so asus has put a lot of effort
into the power supply that is inside
this unit in order to minimize any
interference or electrical noise that
might be transmitted to the sound that
you are listening to so we'll check out
the packaging here
home on the top there to keep it from
getting damaged in any way this unfolds
here this is a very expensive piece of
kit I should probably you know preface
this entire unboxing by saying that this
is not something for your average Joe
computer user at all it is very very
hefty and this is not an internal device
as I probably should not have to explain
at this point in time this is meant to
sit next to your computer and it is a
Seuss's response to other high-end audio
file class off our problems USB Dax but
in their estimation should pretty much
turn the entire rest of that market on
its ear because it'll pretty much blow
away everything else in their estimation
if you guys are interested in specs they
are here although I would like I said I
haven't done as much sort of reading as
I would be required to do in order to
understand exactly what all of that
stuff means I mean what I do see here is
that they've specified every component
they're using so for the audiophile guys
out there who are really interesting in
pairing this up with you know like a
Sennheiser HD 800 or something along
those lines you're going to know exactly
what chips that it's using exactly which
op amps it comes pre-configured with and
exactly what this thing is capable of so
package contents let's move on here to
the accessories alright so we have a
headphone jack adapter we have a power
cord inside just like oh look at that
I got a international one well it's okay
it's just a standard PC one so it is
capable excepting actually that's one of
the cool things about the power supply
it is capable of accepting any any
voltage input so you can use it in North
America you can use it in Asia you can
use in Europe doesn't really matter
include the USB A to B cable
and then what's in the other box here
fascinating so they managed to include
only yeah not
yeah they managed to not include only
the one that I would be using with this
particular device so there you go okay
let's have a look at the unit itself
then shall we
and that's heavy so here we have our
power switch we have our up sampling
button we have our input selector so we
can use coax Toslink or USB mute button
this is your a volume adjustment and
this guy right here
nice big knobs is your headphone volume
finally here is your headphone jack on
the front the build quality this thing
is outstanding actually it just feels
like a piece of audio equipment which is
a far cry from what you get with your
typical PC equipment alright so here is
your unbalanced output here is your
balanced output so you do have the
option of using either and they're each
connected to a different set of op amps
so you can customize how you want each
of these outputs to sound
here's your coax output here's your
toast link or AB rather input here's
your toast link or your optical input
and finally here is your USB input
you're going to want to make sure you
select the correct voltage in this case
I'm going to have to change that to 115
before using the device and then it
comes with a little sticker covering up
the power port and I'm going to leave
that so that I don't accidentally screw
this up when I when I go to plug it into
power so who is this for total audio
enthusiasts who want to use it on their
PC although you are not bound to using a
PC you can use any digital audio source
and I would I would sort of suggest that
most of the users who are going to be
interested in a product like this are
going to be using that port and not the
stereo outputs that are here on the back
be it the XLR or the coax out I would
suggest most people are going to be
using this as
a way to drive their high-end headphones
and deliver the most pure sound
regardless of the volume level so the
thing about a high sound to noise ratio
is that even at a very low volume level
you should still be able to enjoy all
the different aspects of the music and
hear the entire range very very clearly
however if you do prefer more of a warm
sound or if you prefer more emphasis on
the bass then you can actually customize
this guy whether you're using the ASA
software or whether you're actually
changing the hardware of the unit itself
it's fully user customizable and there
are no warranty void if remove stickers
yeah you can take the whole thing apart
if you really want to so you can
actually color the sound that way to
match your preferences now asus is
comparing this to dax that are in the
neighborhood of a thousand to fifteen
hundred dollars that exists on the
market right now and are quite
well-regarded
however this guy is going to be coming
in at a significantly lower price point
so 8.x symmetrical up sampling a Seuss
is is touting the up sampling as a huge
feature of this deck and I can see why
they do that for a number of reasons
number one they have the hardware to
back it up number two is the fact that
so much of the digital audio that you
can obtain these days is very low
quality but not everyone necessarily
wants to go to the trouble or the
expense although if you're really that
worried about the expense I don't think
you're buying one of these but neither
here nor there not everyone wants to go
to the trouble or the expense of
purchasing or finding the high quality
audio that they require so here's a
little quick lesson on bitrate and
sample rate and so the bitrate is
basically how um how high quality of the
sample you're taking of the audio we
didn't really have this with analog
because it doesn't really work quite the
same way with digital everything is in
terms of hard to find numbers kind of
like how pixels don't necessarily equate
to the image quality we saw on an
analogue screen it's just a different
way of doing things okay and then the
sample rate is how many samples at that
quality that we're taking per second so
ideally you would have a very high
sample rate
a very high bitrate so upsampling takes
your how many samples and your bitrate
here and tries to smooth it out to make
it more like how the artist would have
intended for you to hear the audio so
why is 8x symmetrical upsampling
important and what exactly does that
mean what it means is that it can up
sample eight times from a variety of
different sources so I'm going to equate
this to actually more of a video example
so when you're playing when you're
playing older games that didn't support
high resolutions
especially when LCD monitors first came
out so I got a 24 inch 1920 by 1200
monitor and I did that for a very
specific reason the reason for that was
that when I took older content that was
running at 800 by 600 or was running at
1600 by 1200 and I up sampled
particularly from 800 by 600 to 1600 by
1200 with black bars I was getting
exactly a 1 to 4 relationship between
the pixels that I have and the pixels
that it's being up sampled to so this is
not a perfect example because that
resolution change doesn't add any
additional quality to the image but what
it does do is it is an even multiple so
we're not going to lose any quality by
dithering one pixel between sort of the
surrounding ones and blending the colors
and using cheats and hacks like that in
order to increase the resolution so
think of this as your audio resolution
so a Seuss's explanation here is that
common upscaling USB Dax transfer
whatever audio source to 192 kilohertz
indistinguishably however some audio
sources that are lower quality and you
would want to up sample do not evenly
multiply to 192 kilohertz so that's why
the symmetrical index of sampling allows
you to have two different destinations
so two different up sampling quality
levels for the different audio sources
so it's kind of like the display example
I'm giving you guys where you want to
not
lose any quality while you are trying to
increase the quality so as I mentioned
before here we have a slide about the
sound to noise ratio which is based or
signal to noise ratio whichever you
prefer and that is basically a soos
comparing two of some other well-known
USB DAX like I said you have so many
sound cards I mean you can go back as as
long ago as an auto g2z s and they're
cleaning well in excess of 100 decibel
signal-to-noise ratio it's kind of
nonsense my expectation for an
audiophile grade product like this is
that this would be the actual
signal-to-noise ratio that they have
achieved but I haven't tested it yet now
the higher up you get in terms of
headphone quality the more power is
required to drive the I mean they become
speakers at a certain point rather than
being just you know headphone doodads so
yes you require an incredible amount of
power to drive very very high-end
headphones and they're saying basically
I mean this is sort of iffy whether or
not a regular normal headphone amplifier
can dry the 300 ohm or you know anything
about 32 ohms but the point of this is
that they're saying theirs is capable of
up to 600 ohm impedance headphones which
is pretty much getting up there about as
high as it goes so this is a fascinating
way to do product development and I
think it is such a step in the right
direction that it definitely merits a
mention check this out so they actually
besides testing I'm sure they tested
them besides testing them they actually
selected the capacitors that they're
using on the PCB based on what would
interfere the least with the quality of
the audio based on checking out high
five forums like DIY audio and head 500
or at sorry head 5 org so that is a one
way of taking user feedback and
integrating that very closely with the
development of a product because the
reality of it is the guys who they're
going to try and sell one of these two
already know that they want these
particular capacitors which guns of
offense they want to throw into the
device and you're not going to sell it
to them unless you're using exactly what
they want and Asus went and figure that
out ahead of time so in short guys if
you don't already know that
you need one of these and if you don't
know what all of these numbers meant and
if you don't have the money to spend on
a high-quality audio solution then this
is pretty much not for you this is a
very niche very high-end product is it a
replacement for a sound card yes
is it a replacement for a sound card for
every gamer and every guy who sits and
listens to their iTunes library on the
computer no this is a very specialty
product it will deliver better audio
quality than almost anything else you
can hook up to your PC but you got to
pay to play and I got to say I'm
definitely looking forward to checking
this out but for myself personally I
don't think I would be running out
buying one of these because if you don't
have the hardware to properly take
advantage of it and buy hardware I don't
mean your PC because your PC is
irrelevant
it uses the onboard chipset in order to
completely eliminate any quality
interference that could come from a
low-quality PC or low quality sound card
whatever the case may be but I'm talking
hardware in terms of the headphones
you're using the I mean it's not really
hardware but the audio sources that
you're listening to you're going to want
to make sure that you're properly
equipped to take advantage of a guy like
this before you go and set one up in
your home so thank you for checking out
my unboxing on Linus tech tips and don't
forget to subscribe to my NCI XCOM
channel as well because once I've had a
chance to actually play around with this
a little bit I would love to give you my
impressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
