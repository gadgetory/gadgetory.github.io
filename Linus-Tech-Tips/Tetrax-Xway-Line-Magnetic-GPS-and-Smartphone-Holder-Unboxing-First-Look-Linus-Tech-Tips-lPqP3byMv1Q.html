unboxing and product demo in the camera
man's Beamer okay so this is a tetrax
invisible attraction xwy line okay so
I'm not even going to try to decipher
the name because you can clearly see
that this is not some of it is not
English okay but here we have English
GPS and smartphone holder then you see a
couple of circles and then an X shaped
bracket okay so let's go around to the
back of the box where it's gonna explain
a little bit how to use it if you could
see past the 100% made in Italy sticker
which I'm gonna try and remove on camera
here so that you can there we go so you
can see that the bracket actually
attaches to your vents and then you can
affix a phone or a GPS to it apparently
without any hassle so we're gonna test
it with the camera man's iPhone I'm
gonna go ahead and start getting this
box open here I'll play don't slip and
slice the leather because apparently you
know being a camera man is a pretty
lucrative line of work these days
okay so leather seats and iPhones
I'm showing you my phone my phone is
like ghetto look at this thing it's like
Sanyo it's like not even a good Samuel
form okay so we've got these little
discs which have adhesive backing on
them okay so there's the little disc
it's got a bit of a shape to the top bit
of a bump on the top of it there's a
decent backing and it comes with two so
it comes with a little tray that holds
both of them that I totally accidentally
ripped there and then it comes with the
bracket itself so here is the bracket
it's a soft sort of rubberized feel to
it
okay and then if I could figure out how
to do this I would let's see if I can
figure out how to how to open the
bracket because I don't understand oh
you know what I think it's as simple as
this I think all that you do because you
can see it rotates here all that you do
is slide it onto the grill here
and if I break it I'm sure he's gonna
kill me so I'm gonna need just another
moment figure oh it unscrews there we go
brilliant okay so you unscrew it from
the front and you can see that that
widens the gap a little bit okay so I
can press that together now and then it
has like rubberized tips on it so it's
not gonna slide anywhere so I can put
that on if I unscrew it just a little
bit more there we go now I've got that
sitting on there really good okay so
then you can tighten it up there it sits
you can still adjust this not quite as
much you can see it does block it a
little bit so you might want to put it
on a vent that you're not using all of
the time and then with your smartphone
or your GPS you take the little
adhesive-backed thing and I haven't
actually asked him I didn't explain how
this would work so I didn't ask him if I
can put this on the back I think it's
quite a strong adhesive so hopefully he
either uses this thing or he can get it
off so I'm gonna try and Center it as
best I can for him it's not moving
anymore that was it okay so that's on
the back of the iPhone now okay and then
you put that's it so it allows you to
use the device as like a hands-free sort
of you know you don't have to open that
actually holds really good too so you
can see the shape right here is so that
it fits into a little groove in the
golden in the golden magnet so you can
mount it supposing it was a GPS you
could line it up properly for one thing
and then you can mount it sideways or
you could mount it this way that is
actually pretty cool so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and yep you can
see this is like on there really good
like look how much I can I can tug on
this and finally it comes away so even
if you were to brake or accelerate you
know as fast as a BMW can not at all
like my car then yeah that's that's
actually really cool thank you for
checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
