more welcome to my unboxing an overview
of the Zalman rezar ater 3 max what
they're calling their ultimate liquid
CPU cooler so how could they call it
ultimate when it uses a single 120
millimeter radiator Zalman has done some
unique things with this particular
cooler that I actually really like so
number one is they are using an all
copper microphone design for the CPU
block you can tell that okay here hold
on first things first guys this is not
your average a Sutekh om or kulit om
unit so there that's one thing that
Salman's done that I really like right
off the hop is they've actually tried to
do something different which is cool
they're using a copper micro fin design
for the CPU block here so it's got a
nice copper base on it like that and you
can see it does have a little bit of
sort of a Sutekh looking this to the
shape of it so it uses like a puck sort
of design for the pump and CCU block
which are a combo unit and then it uses
retention ring hold down base things
like this but they're mounted a little
bit differently so they actually go on
the bottom here screw into place and
then mount to your motherboard like that
Zelman includes their usual sort of many
many bits and pieces mounting hardware
that I'm not a huge fan of to be
perfectly honest but if it gets the job
done and they're manual is reasonably
reasonably easy to follow along with and
I don't mind too much and it usually is
then we get to Wow look at this thing we
get to the unit itself so they're using
quarter inch tubing and they're using
that nice super flexible non evaporative
stuff so I don't know if you guys know
this but most tubing is somewhat porous
which means some of the fluid will
evaporate and this stuff is is not very
porous at all next up is they are using
a nano fluid nano particle fluid inside
so instead of just using water with some
glycol which is what we're typically
used to see
in these because of its anti-corrosive
properties and its anti-freeze
properties which is great for shipping
all over the world they're using a
completely different approach that may
actually contribute to better
performance so I want to finish up with
the block here where they've got a nice
shiny Zalman logo as well as a blue LED
element here around it they've got a
three pin right here so that's going to
power the pump as well as monitor the
RPM when it's installed on your
motherboard and then let's move up to
the radiator so the radiator uses a very
Zalman looking design here so it
actually looks kind of like their CE NPS
9900 series where they've got all sort
of what looked like curved heat pipes
but are actually water channels in this
case that go around the outside so
there's actually a dual radiator design
here that's kind of masked by the fact
that there's this plastic shroud on it
so there's an inner one and an outer one
both of which are going to benefit from
the airflow from the single 120
millimeter fan that's on it now one
thing I don't like about it is you
typically do get better performance out
of a radiator if you are shrouding the
outside of the fan so you're focusing
the airflow through the fins
however Zelman sort of figures they've
gotten they've achieved good enough
performance in this fashion if you do
want more of a traditional fan on the
back of it you can actually mount it
using these screws on the back here so
you can have it mounted in a push-pull
config the one fan that's on there now
is powered by a 4-pin pwm connector
right there that comes out of the back
here oh another thing guys it should be
noted that that other fan will have the
same drawbacks where it'll be able to
pull air through gaps here so it's not
actually forcing all the air through the
fins so just just like the one on the
front
however for something like this it can
have sort of all the cool-looking design
elements in the world this is a blue LED
fan as well just so you guys know but if
it doesn't perform well then whatever
right so guys stay tuned we are going to
be doing a performance review of this
particular CPU cooler and I'm really
excited for you guys to be able to check
it out because I really want to see how
it does it's very very thick it's got a
ton of surface area it's got nice copper
construction for that particularly this
part here yeah really excited to see how
this goes
