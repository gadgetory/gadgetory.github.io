unboxing and first look so this is this
is what I claimed was probably the most
flexible headset I'd ever encountered in
terms of input options I'm quickly
becoming a fan of tech and motion
product so tech emotion makes
predominantly headsets and this one
right here is called the airhead 1000
although you know we'll have to evaluate
it to find out if you'd have to be an
airhead to buy one hahaha so it's a
wireless headset it runs on 2.4
gigahertz it has an included USB dongle
it is adjustable and I certainly hope so
as any headset this day should probably
be adjustable features media controls on
the left earcup supports windows media
player itunes and real player so yes it
supports iTunes that means it does
support both PC and Mac oh look at this
haha wow they really stepped up their
packaging game as well media controls
foldable connection to a yes it is
compatible with pc and macintosh hey
what else we got here rechargeable
lithium battery so the battery is
included for your convenience and i am
having a hard time it seems like the
more elegantly designed the packages
more difficulty i have opening it
because i usually haven't seen that code
before so the battery is included you
don't have to worry about changing it or
recharging bah ok you have to worry
about recharging yes it comes with a no
and unobtainium battery that lasts so
yeah you do have to worry about charging
it but it's not like you know beats by
dr. dre where you got like these
triple-a batteries that for whatever
reason they run off of although I don't
know if the newer skus do but certainly
the original one that I love dad did
chat application for VoIP experience
although you're probably going to need
to want to use whatever other chat
application you already use USB powered
so you can power them by USB if you
don't happen to have the battery charged
up and the three and a half mil lineup
for your speakers or a second headset
now that is cool ah you know what okay
hold on a minute guys I'll be back in a
sec so this headset is actually the
answer to a problem that I have had in
the past so when I tried to look for
product that supported dual wireless
headsets with the same audio input
source i ended up with this thing from
the source and it's a total piece of
crap it wasn't that expensive which is
fortunate but these are incredibly heavy
and incredibly uncomfortable so you see
how the ear cups are they look kind of
soft and they look ok but this is rock
hard this is not that much padding and
this is not the same size of an ear so
the whole thing sits and mush is on your
ears and you can feel the plastic right
through there absolutely horrible audio
quality sucks etc etc but it was the
only solution i could find that did that
it seems like an obvious thing right you
might want to you know you might live
with other people and you want to watch
TV late at night or whatever and you
want to watch with two people and and
not disturb anybody so there you go so
this could be the solution with that
audio output for a second pair of
headphones and instead of a huge
transmitter that looks like this this is
what it looks like awesome works with
your PC or Mac ok so let's have a look
at the included cable
here we go so three and a half mil USB
power three and a half mil to RCA
adapter it's really they do a great job
of including all the cables do you need
a hand look at this a USB extension
cable is phenomenal okay now let's have
a look at the headset itself so you can
see it is quite adjustable as they
mentioned so it pivots here and then it
also pivots oh no it doesn't have it
there oh yeah pivots a little bit here
and then mostly here so there you go the
left and the right ear phones are
labeled definitely significantly more
padding on this one than the line just
showed you it has the microphone right
here it's a stubby microphone so doesn't
extend or anything like that hopefully
it picks up your voice okay power is
here let's go ahead and see if it's not
probably isn't charged out of the box
and then we've got DC input here there
you go that's where you're going to do
you charging as well as you're out there
there's your auxiliary headphone jack
cool and then on the other side we've
got the ID button so we're gonna have to
look up what that does we've got track
forward and backwards as well as look at
that buttons on here too so play pause
volume up volume down and stop so you
got pretty much everything you could
need on that ear cup this band is
adjustable there you go just like that I
hope the lighting is okay and not this
one kind of funk it wrong there we go
hopefully you guys can see that a little
bit better overall build quality is
pretty darn good so we've got kind of a
soft touch feel going on here on the
outside where these buttons are so it'll
be quite comfortable the rest of it is
more of just a hard plastic and then we
have a soft touch on the top with quite
a soft rubber here so I don't know how
comfortable they're going to be yet but
let's give them a shot they're very very
lightweight which is also a really good
thing compared to those other ones I
just showed you which were not
lightweight and the lightweight really
helps to keep it from weighing down
pressing down on your head even though
the band is quite hard I'd say they
could have used a little bit of
cushioning there they sit on my ears a
lot more comfortably than the other ones
I can't feel the plastic through them
although they're not as comfortable as
like but a big part of the problem could
be the fact that I wear large earrings
so those earrings get in the way a
little bit and that's where I can
actually feel the pressure points not
from the earpods themselves so if you
don't have your earrings in then it's
probably not as much of an issue these
are quite convenient to reach rather
these ones there we go i can feel the
tactile response to the buttons and yeah
i guess i'll have to give these a try so
rumbles helped me spend some time
auditioning the hair had 1000 headset
see here's him with an airhead 1000 had
set on he's adorable as you can plainly
see apparently he's stuck hey go honey
so after I've spent some time with them
I mean my general feedback is fairly
simple so number one is I was absolutely
blown away by how much bass these things
deliver I guess I shouldn't have been
that surprised given it says right on
the box that they have 40 mil drivers in
them I was not particularly impressed
with the hives of the mids so you know
you're not going to be doing any serious
music listening on these although you
should have known that already just
looking at them they're not going to be
an audio file level headset they're more
of a convenience type of thing
lightweight fairly good range from the
base station in theory although we're
going to test that in a minute driver
setup was a snap all I did was plug in
the USB dongle and it was done as soon
as I press the pairing button on the
back of the headset what also so to
really say about it yeah they'd be great
for movies great for games like I said
not particularly ideal for for music
although i'm going to turn them on with
music and i guess you guys can come with
me and we'll see how far away we can get
from the base station before we run out
of operation little range here so just
going to kick this stuff out of my way
so it's plugged into the back of my
computer here which is about as much
interference as it could possibly have
near it so we'll bring the cat with us I
apologize for the general mess going on
in my house right now this is not the
only project I have on the go at the
moment so let's head
downstairs still working but we're not
that far away actually we're going to
head into the kitchen dude like there's
always ah there we go so well it's
intermittent now so it's intermittent
with several walls actually if you kind
of look up at this angle yeah up the
stairs but if you look like up here you
could dig I'm pointing there you go that
way so you can see there's actually some
fairly thick walls and floors in between
me and the and the transmitter so there
you go that's how it works and rumbles
say say bye to the viewers check this
out this is like this is so typical just
