an exciting new gigabyte motherboard
second it is an exciting new Intel
chipset so this is the same Intel LGA
1155 platform that supports the latest
Intel Core i7 core i5 core i3 processors
it is made by gigabyte who we know and
love
okay has 16 phases of power 3-year
warranty
ultra durable three all those big
gigabyte technologies we like nvidia sli
dual CPU power interesting power engine
a and power engine be cool but it has a
really cool new feature this uses the
Zed 68 chipset so this is the Zen 68 x
UD for v3 what that means is that even
if you install ok get this a PCI Express
graphics card or even to an SLI or
crossfire X which is compatible with
both you can still use the onboard video
on your Intel CPU because they've all
got it on the LGA 1155 platform to
accelerate things like video rendering
cool right so that is the pretty much of
the killer app that makes the Z 68
different from the P 67 chipset so let's
take just a brief moment here talk about
some of the other gigabyte technologies
that make this board special so USB
power 3x is a pretty cool one actually
here I'm just gonna cheat and with them
phone box USB power 3x so what that
means is you can deliver more power
through the USB ports than their
competitors USB 3.0 is awesome love it
SATA 3 also awesome love it ok all
ferrite core chokes all lower RDS
MOSFETs and all $50,000 Japanese solid
caps as I mentioned before at 16 phase
power and let me see 3 plus terabyte
hard drives all in this touch barroso
gigabyte has implemented UEFI BIOS
technology now with this line of board
so I don't think there's much here on
the back that we really need to talk
about there is one more killer feature
of these e68 but I'm gonna talk about it
in a little while I'm just gonna that's
a hook so you guys can't go away just
yet ok multilingual installation
guidebook user manual driver
download the latest off the gigabyte
website don't install LGA 1156 CPUs they
are not compatible
here is an IO shield oh and the ones
with three times USB power are marked
neat we have ooh black flexible sli
bridge I love little touches like this
where they include you know cuz the last
thing we want is you know you got like a
schmuck see you know great color scheme
board and then they go and include like
a brown SLI bridge it's like that's
great I went and built a
high-performance system and this and now
it has to look stupid so you've got two
right angles SATA cables two straight
SATA cables also black to match the
entirely black appearance and this
high-performance z68 motherboard so
let's go ahead and get this baby out of
the packaging here and there it is now
if you guys ever watch my line is tech
tips show and you ever pay attention you
might remember one thing that I always
talk about first whenever I see it and
that is matte black PCD love it not
everything about it it looks great it
makes you feel like you just bought a
really premium quality product when it
has that stealth black look to it you
know it's not overly shiny although
there are accented shiny bits like the
CPU socket the battery but other than
that it's just got like a dark stealthy
look to it love it okay so let's start
with the CPU socket as I mentioned
before LGA 1155 socket fully capable of
using the full capabilities of the CPU
you put in it including the CPU cores as
well as the GPU core even when you
install another graphics card so all the
p67 all the age 67 boards as soon as you
install a graphics card boom turns off
the onboard video you can't use Intel's
accelerated video encoding software so
that is a great feature to have for this
chipset there is that 21st either 16
phase power design so you can see all of
the phases here you can see the MOSFET
coolers are very bulky very heat
very capable looking okay you can see
they're going to get some incidental
airflow from your CPU fan no matter how
you situate it up here in the top right
top left corner this ideal location is
the eight pin CPU power connector here
is our CPU fan connector over here we
find four ddr3 dimms slots alright so
those are dual channel this is the same
basic technology we find on the p67
with that onboard video inclusion to the
technology list here we have our 24-pin
connector in its ideal location here we
find two gigabyte chipset powered SATA
three ports to Intel chipset powered
SATA 3 ports as well as for Intel
chipset powered SATA to three gigabit
per second ports so these are going to
be the best ones I'd use these ones next
and then probably I'd fall back on to
those ones unless you have a bunch of
SATA three six gigabit per second drives
in which case I guess you'll need to use
these second here we have our front
panel connectors here we have front USB
three here we have one two three front
USB twos here we have front firewire
front audio and it's ideal location
along the bottom edge of the board not
over here like previous generation
gigabyte boards in terms of expansion
ports we have two PCIe 16x slots
although you can clearly see this one is
only wired for 8x so if you do run
crossfire or SLI you're gonna be running
an 8 X 8 X mode which doesn't make very
much difference in terms of performance
2 PCIe 1x 2 PCI so if you do install SLI
or crossfire with 2 dual slot cards you
will be left with one PCIe 1x M one PCI
slot for expansion here on the back of
the board you will find a whole lot of
expansion possibilities so first things
first we've got one of those ps2
keyboard mouse combo ports which I'm a
big fan of we have one two three four
five six seven eight USB 2.0 ports
coaxial and optical audio out firewire
that is powered eSATA hold on I think
that's powered eSATA let's find out
nope that is eSATA 3o e SATA 3 really oh
cool
well that's a neat feature hold on in
just a minute here
well you know what someone leave a
comment on the video let me know if that
is actually a SATA 3 port because that's
pretty neat for external storage if it
is so that is an eSATA 3 / USB combo
port and then this one is just a
straight East out of 3 here's USB 3.0
Gigabit Ethernet as well as 7.1 audio
out and actually you know what it's kind
of funny but I like the this is almost
like harkening back to the old gigabyte
days where their boards had like
explosion of color on them here the
board looks awesome which is great so it
means your systems gonna look great and
then at the back they've gone back to
the old gigabyte ways which I actually
kind of like it's kind of a nice little
touch like you know old-school style
we've got just a little bit of that
gigabyte flare on the back of the system
where it's I don't have to look at it
unless I'm trying to plug in a port in
which case color coding everything helps
a lot was great
now I haven't talked about that other
feature yet I've been saving it and
let's see what Intel Smart Response
technology is what we're calling it so
basically what Intel Smart Response
technology allows us to do as it allows
us to plug in an SSD into one of the
Intel ports and in the hard drive and
then use the SSD as a cache so we've had
products that have used this kind of
technology in the past such as the
Seagate Momentis XT which had a built in
very small SSD such as the HDD boost
from silverstone which allowed you to
mount an SSD and then use a pass-through
to run to a hard drive but this is the
first time we've seen it natively
included on a chipset so the Z 68
chipset has the graphics feature which
is very very important and then it also
has the ability to use an SSD as a cache
for your hard drive so what that means
is if you buy a small SSD rather than
installing your OS installing one game
on it and then going oh where'd all my
space go now I can't put anything else
on my SSD instead you put on the SSD it
hides itself from you completely you
plug in your hard drive you bind them
together I haven't actually tried it yet
so I don't know how it works but you do
that you have the full capacity of your
hard drive and then the system will
intelligently store your most frequently
accessed files and programs onto the SSD
so you can more quickly access those
gigabyte claims
to a 4-time system performance increase
then with hard drive only so that's very
cool thank you for checking out my
