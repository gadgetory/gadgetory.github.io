the My Passport
edge for Mac but don't hit that dislike
button yet I actually don't have a good
reason for you not hit the dislike
button you know what if you want to show
Apple who's boss you know you really
want to stick it to Tim Cook for having
the audacity to you know release
products that are Apple branded and for
other companies to you know what go
ahead just like this video go ahead so
take a second right now press dislike on
the video it'll be worth it you will get
the satisfaction that comes from
sticking it to the man because I
actually don't care if you dislike the
video I'm it's still YouTube bum where
are they called interactions or
engagement it's still engagement I don't
care just like the video go for it so
moving right along the contents are
portable hard drive a USB cable WD
Security WD idea WD drive utilities and
a quick install guide the compatibility
it is formatted HFS+ journaled for Mac
OS 10 lion or mountain lion requires
reformatting for Windows OS so yes this
is a Mac Drive Apple drive formatted for
Apple and it's nice why is it that the
PC drive is always like see I'm good
where is the PC Drive where's the PC
version it's around here somewhere there
it is okay so explain this to me why do
the Apple guys get all the cool stuff
see look at this here's for my passport
edge like for PC this is the NTFS
formatted one its plastic see look at
how nice this one is this is an aluminum
casing it's even isn't even thinner it's
better see you look it's thinner it's
thinner it's metal it's like sexy so you
look at that anodized finish on there
and then the it's like two-tone metal
they did a dark anodization for the top
it overlaps down here on the USB 3
interface
huffs thinks amazing
and this is this is okay anyway I'm not
gonna be I'm not going to be angry about
this because the good news is even if
you're a PC guy you can still buy this
and you can use it with your PC and you
can not use it with Apple Time Machine
which it does happen to be compatible
with for backing up your Mac it can also
backup your PC though hardware
encryption with password protection
keeps your data private so that's a
really good thing as well and not
dependent on using it on an Apple it is
slimmer the image is not actual size
although I don't understand for the life
of me why they couldn't have put an
image that's the actual size they're
ultra slim all-metal password encryption
and I think that pretty much covers it
so there's also an included USB 3 cable
which will work in the USB 2 mode no
problem whatsoever we're gonna go ahead
and plug that in in spite of the fact
that Apple didn't even deem it necessary
to implement USB 3 in tellurian latest
generation of products you know we've
had USB 3 on the PC for a long time damn
it's a hard drive thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the my
passport edge for Mac from Western
Digital don't forget to subscribe please
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos if you look at
them look at this the Western Digital
logo on this one is just silk-screened
see it has no texture to it at all
Western Digital logo on this is actually
like embossed it's like a it's like a
textured like metallic thinning on top
of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
