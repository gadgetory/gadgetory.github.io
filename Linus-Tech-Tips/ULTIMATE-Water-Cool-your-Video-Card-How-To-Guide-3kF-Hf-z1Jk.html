for more details welcome to the ultimate
video card waterblock installation guide
right here we have an Asus GeForce GTX
Titan and step 1 guys is for the love of
whatever you believe in please test the
card before installing a water block on
it because it's an awful lot of work to
take it apart put it back together take
it apart and then put it back together
when you find out it doesn't work after
you've put a water block on it make sure
you're working at a safe anti-static
workstation in our case we're using a
mod mat from mod right next lay out
everything you're going to need two
tools in this case a Phillips head
screwdriver next is hardware so in this
case our graphics card as well as all
the pieces that were included with our
water block itself a little bit for
screws it's a disaster if you lose those
isopropyl alcohol as well as something
to clean thermal compound off with and
last but not least guys instructions I
don't care who you are if you're not
reading the instructions for a water
block you're doing it wrong it's very
important because sometimes there will
even be last-minute revision notices
posted on the instructions step 4 remove
the stock heatsink before you start I
recommend taking pictures so that if you
have to put it back together you're
going to have a point of reference to
use later on as you remove screws put
them somewhere safe this is incredibly
important because whether you're selling
your graphics card down the road or
whether you have to send it in for a
warranty repair you may need to be able
to put that stock cooler back on
always be sure that you've removed all
the screws before attempting to take the
heatsink off sometimes there can be one
left that you didn't spot before or one
that's a little bit tricky to find such
as the one that holds the card onto the
i/o panel right here another couple of
spots where you might find tricky screws
are here those are pretty tight remove
those with a different screwdriver and
then I've sometimes found ones at the
back of the card that need to be removed
as well but that's not the case with the
tighten these two do need to go though
one thing to watch out for as you're
removing screws is not all the screws in
the graphics card are the same so either
with pictures or by labeling them as you
go make sure you keep track of what goes
where remember it could be two to three
years by the time you have to reassemble
this thing so once all the screws are
removed pull the PCB away from the
heatsink with a twisting motion rather
than with a pulling motion to ensure
that you don't pull any Ram modules off
of the PCB as you go there we go
carefully remove any fan headers or LED
light headers without damaging the
connectors take all of the thermal pads
that are still attached to the card and
put them back on the cooler this helps
you keep them safe and in the right
place during storage
next put the card aside for now and put
all of the screws back exactly where
they went into the stock cooler
step six is the same as one of the other
steps please for the love of everything
RTM read the manual this particular
water block comes with two different
thicknesses of thermal pads read the
manual and you will know why don't read
the manual and you could end up frying
your GPU that serious guys step 7 is to
clean the existing paste off of the GPU
core I usually use toilet paper for the
first round as well as 99% isopropyl
alcohol flip it over for a clean side
and take another run at it
then as a last finishing touch once
you've dried all the alcohol off of it
it's never a bad idea to take a
lint-free cloth in this case I'm just
going to use my sleeve because I don't
have one handy and ensure that there are
no toilet paper bits left on the GPU
itself that can affect cooling it's also
never a bad idea particularly for some
configurations where you're going to be
using small heat sinks on the RAM or vrm
components to do a quick pass of those
ones because there might be a little bit
of oily residue left on them that would
cause additional thermal adhesives that
you put on afterwards to not stick
correctly now because we read the manual
we know to use the point 7 thick thermal
pads instead of the one thickness
thermal pads because this one is for
most cases but because of manufacturing
tolerance issues with some GPUs you
might need to add a slightly thicker
thermal pad for you know these memory
modules or these ones where this one
doesn't quite make contact but if you
use this one in the first place it could
hold the block so far away from the card
that the GPU itself doesn't get
adequately cooled now what we'll need to
do is cut to size so you can either
measure this or hold it up against the
right spot or just kind of eyeball it
thermal pad strips remove the backing
from both sides this is very important
because if you don't do that then your
parts will overheat so there's one piece
and a second piece there we go then
apply these to all of the parts
indicated by the instruction manual in
this case it comes on a separate piece
of paper that indicates exactly where
all the thermal pads go once you've cut
them to size
in the case of this water block we need
thermal pads not only on the CPU block
itself but also on the aluminum that
plate aluminum aluminum aluminum as they
say in some territories not in Canada
that's not even a Canadian accent which
really begs the question why did I say
it at all
neck
apply new thermal compound to the GPU
itself you can use the included thermal
compound in this case we will be but you
can get better quality aftermarket
thermal compounds a lot of the time than
the stuff that tends to get included
with these blocks my personal favorite
thermal compound is icy Diamond uses
like diamonds and stuff for GPUs I do
tend to use a little bit of a different
methodology than for CPUs I tend to
spread out the compound a bit more
because they tend to be a bit larger and
I tend to put on a little bit more this
is a non conductive thermal goop so I'm
not too worried about it getting sort of
over the edges here and causing a short
for this next part I recommend taking
the water block and putting it on
something that is raised a little bit
above the surface of your work area it's
important to give room for the rear i/o
to overhang the surface that you're
working on line up the block carefully
with the mounting holes in the back of
the card see this you can just visually
check as you put it down then once you
have everything aligned it's going to
poke my head in here to make sure I've
got it there we go I would press it down
then you're actually going to remove it
this allows you to check on the thermal
pads to make sure that everything was
making adequate contact and Allah gives
you a pretty good look at the spread of
the GPU thermal paste this looks alright
by the time we crank this down tight
that should be spread out just fine so
we're going to put that back on and
we're ready to tighten her down the
aluminum backplate goes on before we put
on the screws because many of them
actually go through it there we are
and this particular block comes with
optional plastic washers to keep the
screw heads from scratching the top of
the aluminium backplate however I'm not
too worried about that
and I would rather the clean look of the
screws directly through the backplate to
having those plastic washers in
everything goes in lightly to start very
very lightly to start we don't start
cranking things tight
till all the screws are in I recommend
starting with the GPU screws themselves
in a cross pattern before moving on to
the ones all over the rest of the card
now that everything is in loosely we're
ready to start tightening things down
you don't want to wrench it super tight
remember that's a fragile graphics card
under there but you also want to make
sure that everything's making good
contact with the thermal interface
material on both the aluminum backplate
and on the GPU water block itself this
next part is totally personal preference
guys but you're going to have to get
some fittings for your GPU block most of
them well pretty much all of them these
days use G 1/4 threads which means as
long as you get G 1/4 fittings you
should be good to go
in our case we're using some coolants
3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD compression
fittings and these you have the option
of either installing on the top of the
card so here or you can take out the
plugs on the bottom and install them
here you don't want to put them both
fittings on one side because then it'll
go right through without cooling
anything but as long as you put one
either here or here and the other either
here or here the water will pass through
the card so this gives you a lot of
flexibility in terms of how you connect
the tubing to your graphics card so
there you have it guys now you've
installed the water block on your
graphics card this yields better
temperatures and it can with GPU boost
2.0 yield better performance as well as
a different overall look in terms of the
aesthetics of the card now whether you
prefer the stock cooler on something
like a GTX Titan or the waterblock look
is totally up to the individual but I
personally don't find that there's much
that sexier than a couple of graphics
cards or even more than that
water-cooled next to each other in an
sli or crossfire configuration thanks
