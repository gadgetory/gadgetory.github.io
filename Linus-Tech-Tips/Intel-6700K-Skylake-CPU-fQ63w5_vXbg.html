consumer grade flagship skylake CPU and
z170 chipset is here that's right I said
flagship which probably seems a little
strange considering Intel's previous
top-end quad-core codenamed Broadwell
haven't even been on the market for
three months on the desktop side and
although Intel has gained a pretty big
market advantage over AMD partially due
to how regularly they release CPUs and
chipsets the past few processor
architectures have merely felt like
incremental upgrades to a lot of people
with many gamers and enthusiasts like me
still happily rocking their Sandy Bridge
chips from 2011 2600 K for the freaking
wind so what does skylight bring to the
table and is it the next big thing like
the video if you want to see us check
out a 3d printer called the ultra maker
2 extended
the Logitech G 303 features lightweight
design and advanced optical sensor with
Delta zero technology for precise
tracking and RGB lighting to match your
setup click now to learn more let's
start out with a look at the CPU itself
this is a core i7 6700 K and just like
all of its other K series i7s it
features four cores four hyper threads
for a total of eight threads and an
unlocked multiplier for overclocking
out-of-the-box you'll get a 4.0
gigahertz clock with the turbo-boost
frequency of 4.2 gigahertz now if this
doesn't sound like a big improvement
right away that's because Intel's last
gen 4790k ran at the same base clock
speed but while the CPU may not have
incredibly eye-popping specs at first
glance the skylight platform does come
with quite a few improvements we haven't
yet seen on mainstream chipsets for
starters ddr4 support is finally
available for cheaper motherboards with
skylight supporting up to 2133 megahertz
ddr4 Ram gone are the days where you had
to pay a thousand dollars for a six core
CPU and straight baller board - just to
try out some memory it really doesn't
make much of a difference anyways check
this video out for more on the
differences of ddr4 and ddr3 skylake
also comes with the revision 3.0 of
intel's direct media interface or DMI
which is basically the thing that
connects your CPU to the chipset and
many of your computer's other components
and peripherals it's twice as fast as
DMI 2.0 on Haswell and other earlier
processors and given how DM eyes four
lanes carry 20 lanes of PCI Express
bandwidth to and from the CPU the extra
speed should help if you happen to be
running a whole bunch of high-end stuff
like big external storage high speed
PCIe SSD s or just downloading a
streaming tons of stuff through a big
internet pipe skylake also includes some
serious improvements on the graphics
side as well now I know that many of you
like me or can be running skylake with a
discrete graphics card but remember
skylake series is going to include lower
end chips like core i3 s and pentium so
if you are using the integrated GPU
maybe inside an HTP c or something
you'll be able to enjoy the full
port of HEV C codec the successor to
h.264 which is newly supported in
Windows 10 skylake also includes native
support for thunderbolt 3.0 which has 5
gigabyte per second transfer speed which
means it is also fast enough to output
4k 60 Hertz video over HDMI or 5 K 60
Hertz video over DisplayPort very cool
so how well does this thing overclock
well first Intel's had a few issues with
several overclocked CPUs both Ivy Bridge
and Haswell had some well-publicized
issues with excessive heat so much so in
the case of has well that Intel's
refresh of has well Devil's Canyon had
improved thermal interface material as a
major selling point
so Intel's tried to reduce heat output
bond skylake by doing two different
things one was improved power efficiency
and 2 was moved the voltage regulator
off the CPU and back onto the
motherboard to reduce the amount of crap
that's actually heating up the CPU
package so even though the smaller 40
nanometer process could otherwise result
in higher overall temperatures these
changes should result in a relatively
easy overclock on a wider range of
motherboards including cheaper ones that
don't have the fancy 8 or 12 phase power
VRMs and early tests show that it
actually won't be nearly as much of a
variance between individual chips as
well which is nice you won't have to
hunt for certain bins anymore hopefully
it's benchmarking time for our test
bench we used the new Asus z170 deluxe
motherboard with our core i7 6700 K
along with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 20 400
megahertz Ram a Samsung 850 Pro 1
terabyte SSD a reference gtx 980ti and a
corsair 100 a GTX liquid cooling cooler
we took this set up and put it up
against a devil's canyon core i7 4790k
running on an asus saber-tooth z97 mark
1 also is sixteen gigabytes of 24
hundred megahertz ram albeit ddr3
instead of ddr4 and kept the rest of the
components the same to get an apples to
apples comparison or as close as we
could
given that the two CPUs are different
and used different types of memory we
overclocked both chips to a stable
point seven gigahertz on one point four
volts we use PC mark eight to test
general performance and Cinebench along
with 7-zip to give our test bench a CPU
bound workload our overclocked skylake
chip showed slight improvements over
Devil's Canyon perhaps not enough to
notice in everyday situations our gaming
benchmarks told somewhat of a similar
story with virtually no difference in
far cry 4 and City skylines but we did
see about a seven FPS improvement in
total war attila which is pretty CPU
sensitive title that also really pushed
our gtx 980ti at back settings
so although skylake isn't a massive
improvement clock for clock over the
previous generation only about 4% in pc
mark 8 is it still a compelling upgrade
well if you're running an older chipset
looking for a more consistently solid
overclocking experience on mainstream
motherboards or want a specific feature
set like Thunderbolt 3.0 support or
massive bandwidth for things like your
expensive and vme drives or skylake is
going to be certainly worth a look but
if you're not a super serial overclocker
or you're a gamer with a newer platform
like sandy or Ivy Bridge it might make
more sense to spend your hard-earned
cash
elsewhere if you're building a mobile
app and are searching for a simple
payment solution you should definitely
check out Braintree they offer code for
easy online payments through their
Braintree V zero SDK you can get set up
in less than 10 minutes and if you have
any issues during setup you can contact
their support staff we're ready to walk
you through the entire process over the
phone if need be their code supports
Android iOS and JavaScript clients and
they have SDKs in seven programming
languages with Braintree you can accept
paypal Apple pay Bitcoin venmo cards and
more all with one simple integration and
as I said before they have support staff
