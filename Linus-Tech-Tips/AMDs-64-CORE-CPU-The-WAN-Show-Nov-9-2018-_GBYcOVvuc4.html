welcome to the best show that takes
place on Friday afternoon on this
particular channel that's all that's yes
I mean I wouldn't compare it to anything
else because nothing else is really
quite like the land show um so I have a
special co-host this week and the story
behind this is actually a good one so
Alex here has actually worked at Linus
Media Group for the better part of
almost like two years now it's all right
no yeah yeah pretty close Wow
so this will be your two-year like
annual performance review coming up next
month yeah that's incredible
so on his performance review will be a
lot of good things like Alex has done a
great job of our laptop content a lot of
our more Makery content he installed the
single most dangerous thing in our
entire studio a few weeks ago CNC you
don't agree that's the most dangerous
thing in our studio probably not okay
what's more dangerous
other than Dennis with a power tool that
doesn't count you don't get to just take
Dennis Plus something and create
something more dangerous than the CNC
because you could just have Dennis on as
the CNC there was that time when the
laptop cart the like AC power screwed up
and it was just like the whole laptop
cart had AC power okay but I'm talking
present-tense the most dangerous thing
in our office that was pretty bad that
was a bad thing anyway there's gonna be
lots of good things but then we had him
on to host an episode of tech linked a
couple of weeks ago and so actually we
the first time he did it was a couple
months ago and I watched it and I was
like okay yeah like you kind of warmed
up more towards the end and you had your
moments you had like some pretty
brilliant moments like the intro I
thought was great and I checked in I was
like so you didn't realize the camera
was on yet no slash didn't realize they
were going to use it no I knew that you
knew they were going to use it
meeting anyway sure yeah
anyway the point is there were these
moments of brilliance and I was like
okay there's potential here but you and
I need to kind of meet about hosting
style before before you do another one
and then we did and then he was hosting
another one and halfway through I was
just like I think we're creating more
pressure and more tension with me
standing here and like trying to help
you through this as opposed to helping
so new plan
you're gonna help co-host the wine show
get a little bit more comfortable on
camera and we're gonna go from there so
we've got a lot of great topics for you
guys this week what do you got what's
your top picks for topics yes oh I
didn't and now I wish that I really
didn't
sorry what what do you got AMD they have
64 core epic processors you might say
there oh that's like two in a row that
are brutal and oh I don't even see it
here but there is more news about AMD
that's just not great what news was that
well they thought embargoed is it that's
not something like we're working on that
you overheard like me and Anthony
discussing is it no oh okay as long as
you can find an article that you can say
throw that in the dock and we'll pull it
up later but the rumors around raid
AMD's Radeon rx 590 don't look
particularly promising what does look
promising is Samsung's promise to unveil
flexible display phones moving forward
we'll be talking talking about that a
little bit and this doesn't look
promising this is actually just more
annoying than anything else Apple is
apparently blocking Linux installs on
computers equipped with their latest t2
security chip what are they trying to
secure at this point okay
sorry we'll discuss it in more detail
later first the intro
it works sometimes
this intro was created
back when we sat on a couch
yeah
like that
and by the time we got rid of that couch
it was disgusting because there would be
times when we'd be hosting the LAN show
on like a pretty warm afternoon the old
office didn't have air conditioning and
like even this one being out here in the
warehouse during the summer like it it
didn't have air conditioning until the
very end of the summer this year we
actually never got to turn it on I don't
think you know we have air conditioning
out here now right no I didn't know that
yeah look there's one unit here and then
there's one over on the other side the
crappy air conditioning installers are
the reason that our roof leaks right now
oh I was kind of wondering what caused
that yeah so you know fix one problem
create another that's life for you right
so anyway that back cushion I would
usually put it behind me because the
IKEA couch that we bought for the LAN
show was sort of like not really the
right proportions for me like the the
Christians were just horrible from Italy
okay I was being kind being kind so
maybe they're not comfortable for anyone
because Alex doesn't look like it right
now cuz he's slouching a lot and here
maybe it's more in his legs but he's a
lot taller than me so if it doesn't work
for me and it doesn't work for you it
probably doesn't work for most people so
I would always have this cushion behind
me and I'm a bit of a back sweater so
that cushion was never washed and for
literally years once a week I would I
would soak back sweat into it so it had
like this kind of you know that musky
smell that like attracts the ladies no
not that kind of mask no the really
gross mask looks out this week for those
of you who are asking thank you for
asking
let's appreciate let's appreciate
new-new Luke because James is new Luke
so you don't get to be new Luke you're
like you can be new James except that
what you were hired at the same time
alright what topic do you want to jump
into you want to talk about AMD's 64
core epic processors sure they're 64
cores 7 nanometre awesome and this is
why you were kicked off Tech linked
so AMD is really really turning the
turning that what are they what are they
called
thumbscrews yeah turning the thumbscrews
on Intel that that's a torture device
thumbscrews no not that kind of
thumbscrews they just go in your case no
no thumb screws are a thing hold on a
minute
no no we're gonna use my screen to
Google it because okay thumb screws
torture okay
thumb screw torture thank you thumb
screw there you go oh it looks horrible
yeah I really don't want that on my
mom's so it's bad so you twist you put
the thumbs in there as my understanding
actually here this one looks pretty
brutal and then you twist this thing a
wingnut and it I think just like
shatters the bones and your thumb simple
vise with protruding studs victims
thumbs fingers or toes replaced in the
vise and slowly crushed so that's what
AMD is doing to Intel basically putting
a lot of pressure on them right now to
figure out how to respond to the
onslaught because last year with the
launch of their rise in processors and
the launch of their epic processors AMD
got competitive now it's starting to
look a little more interesting it's not
like it's not like watching an exciting
horse race where you know which horse is
gonna win but the other one is given or
the old college try this is like
watching a race where sometimes horse
one wins and sometimes horse two wins
so with Zen 2 we are expecting to see
IPC improvements to the desktop chips
meanwhile Intel hasn't managed to do
anything other than bump core counts in
the last couple of years and on the
server side of things is remember this
is where the big money is made this is
where Intel has products in their lineup
that cost anywhere between two thousand
to ten thousand dollars per chip and we
talked about like expensive consumer
CPUs like when you're reviewing a laptop
and I say okay it's got a 500 or $500 HQ
are excused
HK processor in it yeah you're going
that's not a whole lot sometimes but in
this a lot I think typically you would
say that's expensive yeah okay I don't
know if it depends
you usually whine about them well yeah
but that's not only because they're not
cooled okay yes so in those cases you're
paying the extra for it and you aren't
getting extra performance because they
run really quite warm and they end up
FRA tooling but anyway so in the context
of something like a fifteen hundred
dollar laptop a five hundred dollar CPU
is really expensive in the context of a
server you know you could easily spend
thousands of dollars on a CPU like they
kind of start where the high-end
consumer level chips end and the
craziest thing about it is we're not
talking you know Alex Clark and his one
laptop and one desktop or Linus
Sebastian his one laptop and handful of
desktops we're talking gigantic data
centers like what was that place you
checked out how many CPUs did they have
that six thousand @ly au @ly go right
and so it was that six thousand CPUs or
six thousand boxes with two CPUs each I
don't remember exactly what is a whole
bunch of blade servers that were set up
with a bunch of Zeon's in them like I
think they had a bunch of 24 and 16 core
processors so in an installation like
that you have 24 and 16 core processes
so in an installation like that all of a
sudden AMD is now competitive in the
lucrative data center market and with
epic I don't think anyone even AMD
really expected their epic processors to
come in and like immediately steal half
of Intel's market share because the
reality of it is that the data center
market doesn't move that quickly the way
that these products get validated is
over a much longer period of time and
the planning that goes on for these
kinds of installations just means that
even if AMD
the world's best supercomputer processor
today it is unlikely you'd actually see
like an actual supercomputer built with
them for another 12 18 or even 24 months
that's the way that it works for those
kinds of things so AMD got competitive
when they launched epic and when they
launched Rison now they're saying Zen 3
and Zen for our on track they
demonstrated a 7 nanometer epic Rome
codename Rome processor with 64 course
and they've had some time for the
industry to get used to the idea that
they might want to plan on using AMD for
these installations so you have to have
the jab and the hook so the first one
was the jab hey by the way we're here
pay attention to us this is the hey
you've got us in the back of your mind
hey guess what it gets even better boom
sixty-four core processor oh by the way
did we mention we're cheaper oh by the
way did we mention that we support these
massive amounts of memory oh by the way
remember all those PCI Express Lanes
that we have and our competitor doesn't
they're still there
and I'm like I think that the real like
Deadpool like a crotch to the face is
the fact that it's also infinitely
scalable like they can just ask Intel
would say just glue on the course and
just keep on doing it there was such a
there was such a jelly vibe from that
jab from Intel when they're talking
about AMD gluing course together yes ok
technically gluing course together is a
more technical term than it sounds like
but it's still it just had this like it
had this salty vibe to it that they were
just like kind of petulant about it like
well their core they're CPUs aren't real
because they're just they just got
toothpicks and and bottle caps and glue
when they put them together like that
well they still are working pretty well
so watch out in this context I think it
makes a lot of sense because right now
Intel is also just like putting two CPUs
on a board yeah so that was on just
Monday that Intel announced their 48
core Xeon which appears to be two CPUs
on like on a substrate is that is that
what it looked like
I think so yeah you'll have to it's not
a ton of details and I know it's
actually didn't look that closely at it
because it requires a new socket I think
it has like 12 channel memory but it's
my understanding again don't quote me on
this I might as well just look it up for
you korzy on but my understanding is it
has 12 channel memory in big quotes
multi-chip package yeah here it is okay
so original article that is from a non
tech and I'm basically gonna read it
with you guys here scaling up to 48
cores per CPU oh no no no oh where did
that mute button go oh wow wow I'm sorry
everyone
battlefield 5 blah blah blah yep here we
go typical oh no that's a four socket
something or other okay
two socket system until yeah here we go
so yeah technically there's these twelve
memory channels but that's just because
we are basically looking at two CPUs on
a single package and then this is where
it gets really crazy these things get a
new socket that is gonna have hold on oh
wow current 24 core platinum lines at
205 Watts we don't know what frequency
they're gonna run at 24 cores per die
PCIe lanes
oh wait okay so PCIe lanes anywhere
between 48 24 per die or 96 48 per die
which again would be identical to just
running 4 CPUs in a quad socket board
I'm trying to find the memory channels
it's just it's just nuts I wish I could
find the socket socket server 12 DDR
Channel wow that add played again as I
scrolled back up whatever it doesn't
really matter the point is this thing is
redonkulous and AMD instead of launching
like a new platform so new socket new
chipset weird CPUs that are like
actually more literally glued together
AMD is refreshing an existing socket
which like I said in the data center
space in the enterprise space matters
because these kinds of deployments take
time to plan and just because they plan
things over a long period of time
doesn't mean that they
leverage the most up-to-date components
if the supplier has a roadmap that makes
any sense
so if AMD says okay look here's our epic
platform
here's our epic platform EP why see
here's our epic platform here's the
servers that are based on this oh hey
we're a month from your deployment you
haven't actually cut your Pio yet by the
way we just doubled the core count or we
have a higher frequency part that it's
at the same price in the same TDP go
ahead and check those in instead great
whereas when you're rolling out an
all-new platform well that for that
would throws a complete Reggie
you can't just swap that into a
deployment it doesn't work that way
so AMD looks to be firing on all
cylinders right now and Intel is still
yeah and it's already on what Amazon Web
Services and ten percent cheaper than
Intel based solutions and and while
we're at it I guess
AMD announces the Radeon instinct which
seems like it should be awesome but I
think it's mostly for blockchain and
cryptocurrency so the instinct mi 60 and
the mi 50 so these are aimed at the
enterprise accelerator market but they M
be looking to significantly improve
their performance competitiveness in
everything from HPC to machine learning
so these would be the kinds of things
that they would do at SF use
supercomputers so researchers who are
working on I forget what some of the
examples of things that they were doing
there were a bit and things like
simulation like processing gigantic data
sets those can be accelerated by GPU
compute I what's the biology stuff that
they do sequencing yep that kind of
thing I mean we're just kind of guessing
that's just what that space does I don't
know how much market share Andy actually
gained with their initial instinct
processors but these look like an
improvement so they
got support for half rate
double-precision up from 163 so they've
got so this is especially useful for
machine learning inferencing where a
high precision isn't necessary
okay oh no they have new low precision
datatypes that's useful for machine
learning inferencing where high
precision isn't necessary and they're
also able to get up to four times the
performance of an FP 16 data type when
using the smallest in for date okay okay
so basically they've got some new some
new modes that they operate in pretty
much peak throughput of 7.4 teraflops FP
64 14.7 FP 32 so okay yeah I mean this
is the kind of thing that won't have a
lot of relevance to you and me
necessarily at least if the rumors on
the street are to be believed with
respect to AMD's consumer GPUs so the
original article is from WC CF Tech so
we'll have to take it with a grain of
salt that people seem to think we should
take it with from my experience there
rumor stuff isn't really any worse than
anyone elses room or stuff like is it I
don't know but apparently their third
polaris GPU revision is coming and it's
going to be called the RX 590 so wow it
looks like they've even gotten their
hands on the AMD confidential NDA
required under embargo until oh there's
this thing there that says comments I
can't see what's under embargo till but
this looks like an official AMD slide
deck I don't even know why they bother
having embargoes at this point well I
don't even know why they bother calling
it something new at this point making
this GP if the rumors are true it has be
based on two thousand three hundred and
four cores compared to the Radeon RX 5
80s two hundred or two thousand three
hundred and four cores yep so that's
same number of course my DRAM does it
have eight gigabytes compared to the
eight gigabytes okay
bus width is 556 bit compared to 556
okay and the name is 590 though that's
that's a change that's a change that's
an improvement it's slightly higher
clocked okay so so what we don't know
right now because we can see on that
main title slide latest generation
FinFET 12 that it could be going from 14
nanometer to 12 nanometer sort of
because if it uses TSM C's 12 nanometer
process that might actually be an
improvement to power characteristics and
performance if it uses globalfoundries
12 nanometer that's actually based very
closely like it might even be a little
disingenuous to call it 12 nanometer
compared to the 14 nanometer process
that AMD was already using on the RX 580
so do they have actually do they have
leaked dye sizes here at all cuz that
might tell us something interesting no
they don't so what we don't know is if
this 12 nanometer shrink is just giving
us some better power efficiency do they
have rated power power drop mmm no
nothing leaked in power draw either so
it's possible that these are just
overclocked but I mean really this was
all AMD could come up with to say to
sell this thing latest generation FinFET
12 which quite frankly in my personal
opinion should not be a selling feature
that you put in front of a consumer does
that seem fair yeah why does my cousin
care what FinFET process you're using
he's not going to what matters is how
many FPS how many dollars I pay what
cool features it has like you know
automatic you know gameplay recording or
special anti-aliasing modes or whatever
the case may be or drivers that work
yeah how many FinFETs it has doesn't
matter okay selling point number two
aggressive tuning for higher clocks so
we
already have that graphics card that's
called the RX 580 OC okay enhanced idle
and multi monitor efficiency that is a
driver improvement and finally expanded
options and robust partner designs so
basically they're saying they're not
making a reference card is that what
that sounds like to you yeah cuz that's
what that sounds like to me right so
it's not impressed expected pricing is
250 to 300 us what was the 580 rate
around there I think they should just
call it the 580 ex and then we'll be
like awesome
they made a faster 580 good job guys
instead of being like it's a 580 but now
we're mad you know that is a really good
point
and it's actually not a video about an
AMD product but we do have a video
coming up about a product that is
currently embargoed so I can't say what
it is unfortunately which is really
frustrating because it would make this
story more interesting but basically
we've got a product that we've got our
hands on already and we've been testing
and the manufacturer refused to disclose
to us certain aspects of the
specifications of the device and here's
the stupid thing about it it makes me
feel kind of disrespected yeah like we
have it we can have ends in our hands
and we can measure these characteristics
it's not particularly complicated to do
so so they're either disrespecting our
competence because they don't think that
if they don't tell us we'll be able to
put two and two together here or they
are disrespecting our time because now
we have to invest time to measure
something that they could have simply
provided on a spreadsheet or they are
disrespecting our thoroughness because
they don't think that we're gonna
bother to talk about this like there's
no way that I can slice this and feel
respected maybe they're disrespecting
our viewers that's another way because
they don't seem to think that they need
the full story so why make it any easier
to get there like can you come up with a
way that not providing some speck of
your product is respectful to your
partners because that's what the media
arm no I can it's just it's just
baffling and that's what I honestly
that's what I feel like a lot of these
kinds of skews whether the 590 turns out
to be what it looks like it might be
which is just a rehash of the 580 but
like maybe from a different supplier
depending on what manufacturer they're
using for the chips and this other thing
that I'm talking about it just like
these these rebrands it just feels like
why even bother then why even seed us a
unit why not just say outright we are
trying to mislead the general consumer
into thinking this is something new when
it isn't actually do you think they're
doing the 590 because they did the 580
whatever SP the they rebranded the 570
to be a 580 I really don't like what AMD
is doing on their GPU side like I
understand why they're doing it they're
doing it because they got nothing it's
like it's very obvious they just they
got nothing and NVIDIA has new stuff
that they are obviously planning to roll
out and Andy's like well that's the way
it works like when your competitor
launches something you got to launch
something so if we can't launch
something new I guess we'll launch what
we already got emeriti did that but at
least they called it something different
no that's what they're doing again
there's no something different
no the 580 did okay my understanding is
the 580 was a different diet even though
it was only slightly slightly optimized
okay so actually a 488 all right all
right listen 304 piney same thing
oh wait when is the last time I am do
you launched a new graphics card well
they did Vega but yeah they don't exist
really do they not like can you buy 56
on new egg like you couldn't during the
whole mining thing like they were
impossible to get but I don't really
know why you would like you can get them
in an iMac Pro yeah okay there's an ass
rock there's an ass rock reference card
on new egg there's a power color Mini
that's pretty cool there are nano rows
cool okay there's a handful of 56 is in
stock but then okay let's take a pretty
well known brand like XFX you could make
the argument XFX is kind of to AMD what
EVGA is to Nvidia at least you used to
be able to they used to have like a
lifetime warranty and stuff actually I
don't think they do anymore anyway let's
take some brand XFX and let's try to buy
10 of these and let's update our card
how do you update your Kart update
quantities and it's looking like that I
know 170 s are considerably cheaper
they've got no they've got 10 in stock
though so apparently no they've got
ok Newegg used to correct you like like
here let's see cuz there's no way they
have like 50 of these things yeah okay
we have 49 overs in stock so apparently
they're actually selling alright maybe
we didn't give rx Vega enough credit or
maybe they have 49 in stock because they
can't figure out how to get rid of it
the point is I don't like what AMD is
doing on the graphics side of things but
at the end of the day as long as they're
kicking ass on one side of the business
then it seems like they can keep
surviving because for a while there it
was graphics that was keeping them alive
they're like okay you guys just just
please just carry us dead weight CPU
guys until we can until we can get Zen
out and then and then you can rest all
right
ok so Apple blocking Linux installs
yeah I just don't get it who cares like
okay so the source was jido for 63 on
the forum the original article hears
from the register okay walk us through
this what is going on here
I have no idea and I don't understand
why it would happen so they're blocking
Linux that's all that I know I really
felt like this article was addressed to
me personally and I I realize now it's
the other Lennis oh yes it's like whoa
what because I was actually like
seriously considering the MacBook Air
until I realized that it doesn't have
the quad core 8th gen processors which
was I know linked to me
actually our MacBook Air is not gonna
arrive till Tuesday so you guys are
gonna have to wait for our content on
the MacBook Air but I was so amped on
this thing because I didn't watch the
keynote or attend the event I just got
excited because like Apple was finally
launching a new MacBook Air and I was
like Alex because you want to do the
review yeah I wanted it really bad cuz I
thought the same thing Alex I don't
think you're gonna get to do it because
I think I might even use it as a daily
driver like I'm gonna boot camp it I'm
gonna you know what I'm gonna give mac
OS a shot because I do every once in a
while and then he gets he replies to me
I think this is or something yeah I just
like it's a dual core and I was like no
no no it's AIT's gemser 8th gen core i7
surely they have a quad core option and
no yeah we just found the stuff like why
like everything like nah not this
surface it's got all the Thunderbolt
ports and it's all sexy it's got the
battery life it could have finally just
been we could have finally had the
laptop we're both waiting for because
like you're on the surface laptop and
here you know what this is awesome 30
second review of that go ok best
keyboard best screen because it's four
by three overall just generally awesome
no thunderbolt sucks ok like I'm not
plugged in right now because
no no way no can't do it right you'd
need to DisplayPort to HDMI adapter up
okay here I go with the razor blade
stealth pretty good build quality pretty
good keyboard nice big trackpad could be
bigger
okay display it's fine I guess
has Thunderbolt so EGP you very nice
mediocre battery life and I don't like
the keyboard at all and he doesn't like
the keyboard at all so we're both kind
of waiting for something to be perfect
and people are probably yelling right
now that the Dell XPS 13 has all of that
but I just don't like it yeah I don't
know like I just open it up and the
screens really small and you can only
get like the 4k one and then
everything's really crammed or you don't
get touched and the honestly 4k displays
on a screen that size make no sense
because once you start scaling windows
like 250 percent stuff does look kind of
stupid like I I know that that's an
aesthetic quibble and that's maybe not
legitimate or whatever but either of us
could use an XPS 13 and we don't so deal
with it people are saying the gram don't
qualities trash yeah well it's not trash
ready good you don't like the 15 yeah
but the 13 doesn't have thunderbolt and
the 13 doesn't have thunderbolt this you
know what though that new HP Envy that
new the accident of sixty that we looked
at in the writers meeting are we getting
one I'm not sure okay tell you what
let's just buy one if we can't get one
all right okay
so let's let's get one of those because
do we agree that one looks promising it
does yeah if the battery life is on
point and the build quality
I have yet to encounter an HP laptop
keyboard that has lit a fire in my soul
though that's the one thing I'm really
worried about because for better like
for better for worse you can make an
amazing laptop you can make the perfect
laptop and if it doesn't have a decent
screen you will never sell it to either
of the people sitting behind this desk
right now
did I say screen keyboard you did say
screen yeah
she is the main thing keyboard is key
and touchscreen I can't just use like a
non-touch screen anymore keyboard is key
I was just trying to go past that come
on I guess if the MacBook doesn't have a
touchscreen but yeah actually
touchscreen is kind of a big deal to me
- all right one thing that we do do a
lot that people probably don't know is
the like teleprompter like the ghetto
one where you know right you're kind of
reflecting but yeah so will literally be
like on location somewhere where is the
last place that you and I did together
I'm thinking of general fusion but I
know we've done one since did we do that
before or after the the trip down to
SpaceX I don't I think we had a prompter
at SpaceX yeah we did yeah
hold CES um you know what we're gonna
have to get back to this because we
haven't done our sponsors for the show
yet oh goodness
sponsor number one is be quiet
oh wow oh god complicated so I'm just
gonna sit back hold on yeah sure this is
ah the silent base 801 ooh I just pulled
the filter off the front no no wait
you're gonna hit the mic okay right
there okay I'm gonna put that filter
back okay cool it's really back it's
backward so don't hit the mic don't the
mic that little old boy did hurt
everyone I know right it's backwards
okay tell you what here you take the
side panel off okay this is really easy
I swear when like Linus isn't holding it
what are you doing let's try that let's
try that again meanwhile be quiet
watching this they're just like really
you guys yeah okay got your acoustic
dampening stuff in there trust me it's
in there I can't see that's fine anyway
that's the back panel so you got your
SSD mounts you got really nice built-in
fan control which is awesome these are
interesting but from the other side so
you can kind of use them to route cables
from over here or from the other side
what's neat is that you can install all
the three and a half inch hard drives
you want or leave it completely blank
it's totally up to you so there's three
SSD mounts back there moving around to
the front is this literally the case
that we used for that builder is this a
second one or so different case okay but
the same one yeah okay so we actually
have a build coming in this where we're
going to do like the fastest gaming PC
tempered glass side panel of course the
year 2018 you got to have that included
pure Wings fans
I believe it's three of them yep two in
the front one in the back you've also
got these are those three and a half
inch cages that you can install all up
and down here really nice clean basement
here so you don't have to see here can
you hold up for a second so you don't
have to see your power supply wires or
anything like that like it's really easy
and really quick to do a nice clean
build in it I have no idea what B quiets
talking points were for this thing so
you know we musta go of them we probably
missed a handful of them but it is what
it is at this point and that was the
last time be quiet ever worked with us
fresh books fresh books is the super
simple to use invoicing tool that

hear
section and finally savage Turkey oh yes
sriracha teriyaki I was I was taking
that no well okay hold on a second we've
got Reaper I'm going for the sriracha
bacon all right savage Jerky's me high
quality ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives their goal was to create a
snack that was full of flavor and spice
but that isn't bad for you
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky like the sriracha bacon and maple
buffalo bacon which is my personal
favorite they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub I haven't
actually tried the spice rub or the
barbecue sauce but I have tried the hot
sauce it is delicious
and their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses
one of the hottest peppers in the world
the elephant wing pepper just kidding it
Carolina Reaper pepper obviously yeah
any way you can use offer code Linus to
save 10% on all their father's yeah no
it's not made of elephant wing pepper
nobody's kind of want to try it now it's
hot have you never tried it I think that
I did and it was unpleasant yet not like
it tasted really good but it was like oh
it burns mm-hmm Bernie like it burns not
just when you pee you know like just
burns
yeah actually burn there I tried it
before and I was like wow that was
really great and then like 20 seconds
later I was like dude all right so this
is mm-hmm did you put the whole thing in
yeah
all right well stay tuned for the sweat
breaking out on his brow over the course
of the next up no you don't get to take
your drink already
all right so right now it's Pleasant but
like we're getting there
back to apple blocking Linux and stuff
so they're t2 security chip is blocking
Linux from booting on Mac devices and
the t2 security chip the way it was sold
to us anyway is supposed to be about
encrypting your data so that if someone
steals your device so if someone steals
your device make
get out of it but instead it looks like
the new MacBook Air and Mac Mini that
both come with the t2 chip embedded are
going to yes okay whatever
so the the latest iMac Pro the latest
MacBook Pro so the new MacBook Air the
Mac Mini any of the devices that Apple
makes that come with the t2 chip
embedded they're gonna have a secure
Enclave they're gonna have a PFS storage
encryption touch ID handling a hardware
microphone disconnect on lid clothes and
other security features but the t2 chip
also restricts the boot process and it
means that Linux support on Mac hardware
is now not just a bad or inconvenient it
is non-existent by default even windows
isn't bootable until you enable support
for Windows via the boot camp assistant
on Mac OS Wow so what this will do is
install the Windows production see a
2011 certificate that's used to
authenticate Microsoft boot loaders but
it doesn't set up the Microsoft approved
UEFI certificate that allows
verification of code by Microsoft
partners so even when the secure boot
functionality has been disabled the t2
chip is reportedly still blocking
operating systems aside from Mac OS and
Windows 10 specifically I really like
this headline that they have here where
it's just T to more like Terminator 2
this is a register but like I know so
many programmers that use mac books and
MacBook Airs all the time and all of
them use Linux on it like they never use
Mac OS or like sometimes they do but a
lot of them just use Linux so I have no
clue why they would do this I mean
there's the obvious sort of snarky
argument well why are you buying a
macbook if you don't want to redneck OS
and I can come up with some pretty easy
answers to that maybe you don't want to
run Mac OS all the time and also they're
just doing their laptops also they're
just pretty nice hardware and here's
another thing like people complain a lot
about the repair ability of Apple
hardware and it is a legitimate
complaint we have run into that problem
or so
however for better or for worse because
of the ubiquity of Apple hardware even
though it's very difficult to repair
finding someone who has gone to the
effort of figuring out how to repair it
can actually be easier in some cases do
you get what I mean by this
and finding spare parts is really easy
to like stuff like power connectors even
if it's soldered you can like find a
dead one really easy and then just
compute and like we mean really easy and
of course a relative sense yeah my
friends in engineering would make a good
buck off of it it's still hard and it's
still a hassle and Apple could still
support third party like service
providers a lot better we're at all but
at least these third-party service
providers keep fighting through and keep
finding away although the t2 chip looks
like it really might kibosh a lot of
this all right
u.s. internet traffic routed through
China for two-plus years yeah we saw a
lot of time left so yeah and I don't
really want to talk about that too much
until it's confirmed yeah and I'm like
what was the other thing some of these
are some of these topics are kind of
like duh like teal ghost posted this on
the forum google confirms that dark mode
saves battery on Android really like ya
think anyway the good news is we're
finally getting dark mode Samsung is
also planning to add it with their new
one UI which is sounds good I hope I
don't know when Samsung announces
they're doing a new Android skin it's
like will we make it better
will they bung it up well they finally
fix my battery drain issue I had it
again the other day and that's now it's
fixed again so actually small iOS just
really annoying thing you can turn the
keyboard dark but then the area below
the keyboard still stays light so it
just looks horrible and I can't deal
with it oh yeah you've been using iOS
for a little while how's that going I
don't like it at all they're just like a
couple small things that like I got
through they like the initial like not
liking it because I just didn't know how
to use it have you found some of the
beautiful things though
like being able to reposition your
cursor with 3d touch or force touch or
whatever they call it on the phone no
how do you use that it's really cuz I've
been really annoyed with like copying
links yeah so do you have your phone on
you yes this is one of those like I
forget how I lived without it every time
I go back to the iPhone so here I was
just like type any type PD types and
stuff and if you want to reposition your
cursor Oh neat huh I had no clue had to
do that yeah so Apple does a really good
job of some little quality of life
things and I'm at the point now where I
think a lot of people assumed from my
iPhone 10s video but I hated the iPhone
or hated the 10s I don't I don't hate it
I just don't care about it it's just not
interesting yeah and quite frankly for
me there are things that drive me nuts
about both sides like my Google pixel
3xl review is not gonna be particularly
positive either and I think I'm just
jaded and tired of phones and so that's
why I'm not gonna be our main writer for
phone videos anymore because I think I
just can't handle it anymore
so I'm still gonna be like senior editor
but I like one of our better received
phone videos over the last little while
the ROG phone was actually 95% prepared
by Jake not by me so take that for what
it is I just wanted like wind you about
a couple more things sure go for it is
on the tennis or the yeah yeah that's
tennis right so I can't put all of my
icons down on the bottom so like you you
only get four I want five yes in order
to search something I need to go all the
way over to the left no nope nope search
is good yeah except for you so you
search just by swiping down anywhere no
but you still you swipe down then you
have to click on it no it's no it
auto-populated look I can type see I
didn't have to click it okay so okay
they do have some stupid stuff like that
though where you'll like I think it's um
when you look up a content or something
I think you have to actually click the
stupid text field before you can start
so what you get to it and now I need to
click search web opens
Safari yeah okay where it's like on the
pixel you just go over it searches your
whole phone and the web that's funny I'm
so it's just rate at the bottom like on
my other phone is right here I'm so
old-fashioned that whenever I want a
Google search I open Chrome and then
start typing
I literally have maybe twice in my life
used even though on a lot of my phones
it's just there by default and I just
forget it I just like can't even see it
that Google bar that's on my home screen
I just I just don't even use it because
I'm old and stupid okay it's kind of
like Jake saw me yeah but like I've had
that search bar on my phone on the home
screen since I had a samsung s 2 so like
how have you not gotten used to it since
then Jake it's just I'm just like I'm
just old and stupid so Jake saw me
trying to pay for something with my
credit card with tap the other day and I
took my whole card and I like put it
down on the reader and he's like wow
you're so old I'm like what and he's
like well the antennas right there so
you only have to go against it like this
and I'm like okay like yeah I never gave
any thought to where the to where the
actual NFC or excuse me RFID element was
inside the card and if I had I would
have known that yes I only have to put
like I'm not an idiot I know how RFID
works but I just never thought about it
because I'm old and I just I always just
put it against it and it always just
worked so what do I care it's like I
always put it against it cuz I did that
for a little bit or just like the end
because I kind of felt cool but it
sometimes just it bugs out and I find if
you do the whole thing it works more of
the time well there you go
I feel validated right now speaking of
validation we should probably validate
some of our super chat oh goodness
people because we haven't yet and that's
really terrible I can't read it's me sad
face this High Line is typical good work
Dave says love ltte would love to see
that you team up with retro RGB for a
retro gaming video interesting we do
have some retro stuff planned so stay
tuned for that
dark inertia high showdown
channel super feat of fun
gave us five euros believe it or not
Channel super fun is still fully funded
people are you hungry
um people internally are allowed to
shoot Channel super fun if they can find
time to do it they're allowed to spend
the entire Adsense income from Channel
super fun on channel super fun which
means that over the last six months
where we've done basically nothing
there's literally thousands of dollars
in a bucket that people could just spend
doing cool stuff if they wanted to but
I'm just not pushing it that's all do
you know what I really want to do
acetylene powered potato cannon I know
you want to do that but that I think is
not a particularly amazing idea so they
also have no do you realize how
dangerous acetylene is and how great it
is in a potato cannon I built one of
these before and we had to like wrap it
in duct tape because it kind of exploded
and then it like really exploded it was
really great that Carter says it's my
birthday happy birthday love your
quality content in quotes Thank You Zack
sir flexor says instead of buying a
better CPU I would buy an OS made for
gaming cutting out the crab
unfortunately that doesn't really exist
believe it or not cutting the crap out
of your OS doesn't really do much for
gaming in fact we still need to do that
follow-up on Windows game mode oh yeah
we should do that
um laggy says hi Linus love your videos
will there be an RG reboot 2019 oh wow I
don't know we haven't even finished 2018
yet yes Thank You Colton that's the plan
evil says where's lucky someone moved
him over to 101 so I plan to move him
back but I had put him in the in the set
there and then yeah I think I think it
was Brandon I think Brandon got rid of
him
it's not a waste of 20 minutes of your
time if you don't spend 20 minutes
moving in Brandon if you just leave him
in his home I think it would have been
really great no but just think about how
great it would have been for this razor
video to just have them in the
background right just chilling there you
know Christian says I've watched your
content for five plus years never fails
to entertain me
awesome Neil says want to show my
support thanks Neil oh wow there's so
many of these laggy tech is back again
oh man leggy tech I'm sorry it was just
cuz I wasn't looking at them yet it
wasn't that I like wasn't gonna read
your content
I mean sometimes that is it but sending
more probably won't help um see kurosu
would I notice any latency going from a
TN to IPS for gaming so we actually have
a video coming soon that's not really
about that actually yeah it's really not
about that at all and though I
personally can notice the difference but
it's like that's if I have them side by
side like a 144 TN beside a 144 IPS
you'll notice yeah but a lot of the time
I'll just be like oh that IPS is just
way better
I find the IPS advantages more
noticeable unity and advantages but I
can certainly see like if you're like
we've got a 240 Hertz TN from isus in
the office here I'm like in csgo like
whipping around
you can still see detail in like it's
amazing on a wall in dust too and it's
incredible but I would I would take IPS
over that every time by the way this guy
also says BT Dubbs Alex you're a
wonderful addition to the home why thank
you
kudos to you - is okay - I guess ah
Kaja keep up the good work thank you
minna de su says don't forget they're
not gonna make a 1080 TI anymore I
actually don't know that it's just kind
of unfortunate what you want to COO but
also whatever we're reading super chats
Oh folding
yes folding screen oh yeah people should
fold its folding month so in
part of fighting diseases and things
we're gonna give away three gPS this
month a 1080 and 210 seventies and to
win two to ten ladies all you have to do
is pull on our team
Alan GGG slash folding for more
information are you it are you firing
these GPUs
yeah just pulling them out of my butt
yeah okay goodbye I hope you at least
like put them in a plastic baggie for no
plastic bag that must've hurt
yeah that's what like the EVGA ones -
and they're like kind of they're pretty
Jetty um anyway says the jerky can get
spicy here's a beer on me jokes jokes on
you i keep the $5 he has to pay for his
own be here and also it really wasn't
that bad I remember it being a lot worse
really yeah I don't think I sweat a bit
but like hello world from Hong Kong says
Ken yeah I think we're pretty much good
nice alright so thanks guys for tuning
into the win show we will see you again
next week
same bat-time same bat-channel may be
different bad hosts will see I'm no how
do you think Alex did let me know in the
comments below or in the chat one of
these if you think he was terrible you
can also let me know if you thought he
was good or just Linus's puns were
really bad the whole time no I'm sad for
that pom no puns Oh
so we we talked to YouTube's I forget I
forget who they were but thumbs down is
apparently worse for your algorithmic
relevance than we fought oh so we might
stop encouraging people to thumbs down
the videos okay so see how that goes
