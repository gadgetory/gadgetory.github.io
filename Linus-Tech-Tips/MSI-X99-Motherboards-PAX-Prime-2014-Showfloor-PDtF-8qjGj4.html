to you by hyperx gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device alright
guys we here at msi checking out their
x99 lineup starting with the ex 99s sli
plus its sports pretty interesting you
got four pcie 16x slot so you can do
quad sli or crossfire and dual pci e 1x
lots if you want like sound cards or
raid cards or something like that for
power on the motherboard it's fairly
straightforward with your 24 pin and a
pin CPU power you've got four fan
headers so not a ton of fan headers but
probably enough one of those being your
CPU which is pre-designated for that
although if you want to plug in a case
fan you can just ignore the RPM and
you're good to go anyways you've got
eight ram slots a standard socket which
by the way is ginormous if you haven't
heard me that say that in previous
videos one USB 3.1 header to USB 2.0
howre and reset on board along with an
OC genie button if you want to just
press that and be good to go before we
go I oh we've got a ps2 port which is
fantastic because even USB 2.0 can be
frustrating to use sometimes dual USB
2.0 8 USB 3.0 an ethernet port which I
believe it's powered by Intel and
standard audio jacks for their ex 99s
gaming 7 board things are fairly similar
the i always the same except for their
ethernet which is powered by killer this
time not intel like it was before so you
get a killer chip on this board no
wireless just land killer other than
that the i/o is exactly the same the
socket is obviously same the same amount
of RAM slots same amount of power same
amount of fan headers most things are
pretty similar except this board does
come with audio boost this is audio
boost to not audio boost one anymore so
there's actually audio great capacitors
on this board which is a kind of a big
deal but if you've been watching some of
my electives videos lately we've kind of
figured out that it's more important to
have really nice headphones but this
should help so it's good to see actually
on the board and this is their gaming
series board so it's got all the nice
red and black accents all over it then
we come to the X 99s X power AC this one
has intel lan and wireless no more
killer it comes with AC on boards you
have AC wireless that comes with the
it's pretty interesting the I oh and
this one has changed a little bit
there's a ps2 port still which I'm
really happy about dual USB 2.0 and then
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten USB through photo on the back
and a USB 3.0 header and USB 3.0 da'kel
header so you can have a crap ton of USB
3.0 if that's what you want dual land
ports are those wireless jackson i was
just talking about and a standard audio
set ups the audio boost though is a
little bit different this is audio boost
one point oh not audio boost two point
oh so it doesn't have the the audio
grade capacitors that are on the gaming
series board but you do get other things
like voltage checkpoints up here at the
top manual overclocking buttons still an
OC genie button if you want to do that
on an X power board and that's that's
about it in terms of overclocking other
than other features like the X power
just being generally good for
overclocking there's actually one more
thing that I want to point out before
we're done here and that's the the
lightning bolt button right here which
will just completely obliterate any
settings that you have in your BIOS
possible it just resets the entire thing
back to factory settings which is
actually pretty cool to see because I've
almost prick boards by kind of mess
around with too much stuff before so
that's nice to see thank you for
