product from gigabyte now I've done a
lot of Intel motherboards over the past
few months a lot of p53 you more am
three boards so this is a 790 FX ta u d5
so this is their premium am-3
motherboard it comes with all of their
highest end features including the three
year warranty etc etc as well as their
three three three onboard acceleration
so that's USB 3.0 what is this I think
it's like power x 3 so it means that all
of the USB ports have three times the
available power so if you're using a hub
or something like that it takes a lot
more high draw devices in order to over
power the port and then it also has SATA
3.0 well yeah here it is
they have it listed not once but twice
on the front okay so this also has a
bunch of other high-end features it has
ultra durable three including the 2
ounce copper PCB it has support for
3-way crossfire graphics ddr3 1866 +8 +
2 phase power design DeLeon theater ok
doesn't come in a high-end box so I
can't like show you the window but since
we're gonna open the box anyway I guess
it's kind of a moot point there's a pink
square here which is very interesting
maybe not interesting camera person has
a bit of a bemused look just move along
moving right along okay here's our Dolby
home theater sticker let's get down to
what is all included we have one IDE
cable and four SATA cables two of which
are straight and two of which are right
angle cables then we have an i/o shield
which is color coded including I'll show
you what the color coding means after
then we have a gigabyte sticker it is
powered by gigabyte then we have the
user's manual as well as the driver and
utility DVD don't use the stuff on that
DVD download the latest from the
gigabyte website then you have a
multilingual installation guide book
showing you how to install a motherboard
although odds are pretty good if you
don't have someone to teach you and
you've never done it before
buying a standalone motherboard all
right let's get this board out of here
and get this show on the road so let's
just okay so it's got a little piece of
tape sealing it at the back and you can
see under there we've got a black and
three backplate which is the same as an
AM 2 or M 2 plus backplate because they
all use the same for hole mounting
configuration okay so let's start with
the 3 times VG egg thing here okay so
you've got 2 PCI Express 16x slots and
this bottom one is a PCI Express 8 X lot
you can tell because I'm not sure if
you're gonna be able to see this on the
camera but the metal contacts only go up
to about here in the slot so even though
it's a physical 16 X lot it's only 8 X
but because it's PCI Express 2.0 it
doesn't really matter that it's 8 x
you're not gonna see an impact on
performance next down here we have a
couple of USB 2.0 headers you can see
that all over this board we have oh no
that's not really true ok I'm not going
to say that ok on the side at him we
have 6 SATA 2 ports as well as to say 2
3 6 at gigabit per second ports so
that's pretty cool
we have an IDE connector and a floppy
connector for some reason and then in
very unusual positions we have I'm sorry
I'm turning this on you we have a power
and a reset on board switch way up here
I'm not really sure why those are there
because normally you'd find them down at
the bottom of the board but there they
are we have a 24 pin power connector up
at the top right and then the other
power connector I'm going to shift your
attention over here is up at the top
left in its ideal position there's your
8 pin okay here is the am-3 socket
supporting only am 3 CPUs and then we've
got support for 4 6 of dual channel ddr3
memory unlike most Intel boards most AMD
boards actually put the each kit in the
color-coded slots which are right next
to each other whereas normally on an
Intel board you'd find them in slots 1 &amp;amp;
3 for optimal dual channel configuration
okay so then we have a pretty high-end
looking sort of heat pipe cooler for the
Southbridge Northbridge and VRMs okay I
think that covers will start oh this is
oh this is this is really cool actually
look it's
like it's like a missile launch button
it's got like a clear cover over it this
is your clear CMOS which which is
conveniently located somewhere where
you'll actually be able to reach it
because like the power and reset so
often they're located down here by the
time you installed two graphics cards I
mean you can't even reach it so this is
really convenient I like that then on
the back of the motherboard and I'm
gonna hold up the i/o shield so that you
can get some context for this we have
two ps2 ports two digital audio ports
then we have hmm okay we have four
plain-jane USB ports and those are these
two yellow ones right here and these two
black ones right here those are just USB
2.0 then we have two USB SATA to eSATA
combo ports and those are these two
yellow ones here and then we have two
USB 3.0 ports okay so that's the USB
configuration on the back these
standards are all intercom pata Bowl so
you don't have to worry too much about
where you plug in your mouse it's just
that if you want optimal performance
from a USB 3.0 external hard drive for
example you want to use these guys okay
you got a couple firewire ports 7.1
audio as well as two Gigabit Ethernet
ports and that concludes my unboxing of
the gigabyte GA 790 F X tau d5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
