get in touch with the PR folks at in
case a couple of times before they
eventually reached out to me because I
really wanted to review the N case M one
since I first saw the crowdfunding
campaign that brought it to life it's no
great secret that I've got kind of a
weird fetish for tiny feet that I mean
pcs and the end case is on the extreme
end of what can be done to make a
computer that uses standard components
as compact as possible it's kind of
magic like the piece of camera tech that
Brandon will be checking out in his
second hosted Linus tech tips video due
out in a couple of days so let's get
started shall we
save on select intel core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more the included
accessories stood out to me right away
most case makers abandoned wire fangirls
due to their cost years ago but you get
four of those and filters to go with
them a power supply bracket and all of
your mounting hardware neatly sorted
into little baggies for your consumption
if I had to complain at this stage
though it would be about the complete
lack of included documentation there
isn't even a little slip of paper that
says hey you can download the manual on
the website here fortunately I found
this image on their site without too
much difficulty and the site also has
some helpful tips for component
selection but it should be noted that
most of it is quite technically worded
and for a project like building a PC in
the em1 while it's enough for
experienced builders for folks who are
new to building pcs I think it could be
improved the first step is to pop off
the front and all three ventilated
panels on the sides and top it should be
noted that I have the top panel with the
slot load o D D cutout in it but this
can be swapped out for a plain one if
you prefer not to have an optical drive
and not to have a slot for the one you
don't have with all of them off it
reveals the skeleton of the case which
actually other than the motherboard tray
doesn't give us a ton of hints about how
a computer is supposed to fit in here
again a very experienced builders will
probably be able to fight their way
through it using a combination of the
FAQ compatibility and spec tabs on the
website but for those who are less
experienced well I guess that's the
point of people like me existing so
let's do a tour of the guts of the case
together shall we at the front you'll
find two USB 3.0 ports a power switch
with power and drive activity LEDs built
into it and front panel audio jacks
along with mounting holes to put the
slimline optical or up to two two and a
half inch drives between the front of
the chassis and the bezel using fine
threaded spacer screws and rubber
grommets and the handy-dandy SSD
stacking plates two sets of which come
in the box on the right hand side is the
motherboard tray with a cutout for easy
cooler installation and
absolutely zero room for cable
management you can run really small
stuff between the motherboard and the
tray if you're desperate but other than
that you'll be bundling everything over
on the other side of the motherboard
under the power supply also over here
speaking of your power supply is the
intake for your power supply which will
probably be SFX if you don't want to
give up mounting drives or a radiator on
the left side the ability to use a
modular power supply or the ability to
install a full length GPU not worth it
IMO especially with Silverstone's
excellent 600 watt SFX power supply as
an option where you don't have to make
any of those compromises and you even
get 0 rpm mode when it's not under heavy
load making for a very quiet little
system while we're looking at the power
supply the top of the case is mostly
taken up by the mounting bracket for it
and this cleverly routed AC power input
extension with a good look at just how
little space was wasted in the width of
this case once you fill it with hardware
especially if you goes balls to the wall
with an ROG board with that beefy
daughterboard mounted power delivery
solution and 3/8 inch tubing on your a
i/o CPU cooler it should be noted that
had I not opted for a dual 120
millimeter radiator there's a bracket
that sits where the forward-most
radiator fan is now that holds up to two
three and a half inch hard drives and
the space taken up by my rear most
radiator fan would have been reserved
for clearance for a CPU air cooler
around the back we find mounting holes
for an eighty or ninety two millimeter
fan by opted to leave this empty since
my dual 120 millimeter radiator fans are
pressure optimized models configured as
intakes with the rest of the case
basically acting as passive exhaust back
here we also find external water cooling
grommets definitely useful for the
third-party reservoir mount that some
users have installed back here and IO
for the motherboard and curiously
actually three PCI slot covers allowing
up to a triple slot card if you opted
not to install a three and a half or two
and a half inch drive using rubber
grommets in the bottom where we have
this hard drive mounted another option
down in the bottom thanks to the feet
that keep the case up off the desk or
or is a 120 millimeter fan in the back
and a 120 millimeter fan in the front
but again neither of those are possible
with that hard drive in there you can
throw in an 80 or 90 two in the front
but I opted not to since my GPU intake
is right there anyway which leads us
finally to the left-hand side where we
can see the system assembled and we
actually may actually we really can't
see a whole heck of a lot of the system
assemble just the dual 120 millimeter
radiator and the gtx 780 Ti that I threw
in to find out if this sucker will
throttle even one of the poweris
hungriest cards available poweris so all
that's left now then I guess is to start
tearing it down so you can actually see
how all the guts fit in there the
radiator mounting bracket comes off
first with four screws revealing the CPU
area and the incredibly tightly packed
motherboard connectors that just barely
allow enough clearance for my 16 gig
memory kit to fit inside pulling out the
GPU gives us a better look at the rat's
nest of cables in front the front of the
case where the video cards PCI Express
power connectors are wrapped up and also
a better look at how much room there is
for high-end large graphics cards I
would seriously recommend sticking with
a reference design like I have for this
build but if you really wanted to you
could actually install something taller
than standard like an Asus Direct see
you card or MSI gaming card just don't
expect the rest of your system temps to
be very good as we demonstrated in this
video here so I guess all that's left
now is the conclusion the m1 is a
stunningly strong first entry for a new
manufacturer and delivers exactly what
it promises with a thoughtful internal
layout that wastes no space and allows
your PC to be as quiet as it would be in
a much larger case without compromising
on thermals my GTX 780 Ti turbo dup
around 1 gigahertz in Crysis 3 without
even touching boos clock settings
freaking impressive there are some sort
of less positive notes on lit bits like
the inclusion of different kinds of
rubber Isolators without specifying
which is for what and general
documentation deficiencies with encase
relying on a thread on hard form to
guide users during the installation
process not too
mention that it's hmm not exactly cheap
pretty darn expensive but if you're
looking for something that's beautiful
and functional the end result really
does look like it's going to be worth
the effort it's compact gorgeous and not
going to be easy for any case the top if
they want to try to build something more
compact that fits a full sized system
speaking of beautiful mass drop sent us
a pair of headphones that actually
really surprised me these are the a
audio legacy elites and they're
beautiful
so naturally I expected them to sound
like junk but I was dead wrong a audio
has actually hit a nice sweet spot with
this between sound quality price and
features with active noise-cancelling
included but also possible to just turn
off if you don't feel like replacing the
triple-a batteries at the lowest drop
point by the way the price looks pretty
darn impressive which you can check out
at the link in the video description and
if you haven't heard of mass drop by now
well then you must be pretty new to this
here interwebs show that we got and
guard and earn it
there a site that facilitates group buys
sourcing product ideas through their
community with poles and then working
with distributors and manufacturers to
save you money on the products that you
want to buy they carry a wide variety of
different products from a multitude of
industries and their inventory changes
all the time so head over to mass drop
today using our link that's drawed up
sip slash Linus tech to check out these
headphones the legacy elites from a
audio as well as all their other awesome
drops using our link doesn't give us a
commission or anything but it does let
na strap know that we sent you so please
click that link in the video description
when you sign up and while you're down
there we also have a link to support us
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
give us a monthly contribution or change
your amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate code so whatever you're buying
like new power cables or whatever else
it is you buy on amazon we get a small
kickback that kind of thing helps us out
a lot thanks again for watching and as
