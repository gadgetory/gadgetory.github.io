my thoughts on the new iPhone 10s and
10's Macs and Apple's position as an
innovator in general and maybe it's a
video I shouldn't have done because I
allowed myself to get emotional rather
than giving equal airtime to positive
aspects of the iPhone experience that
might not mean as much to me but clearly
mean a lot to our community so with the
goal in mind of creating a second video
now to balance out our first we turned
to you and asked what were the main
reasons that you bought your iPhone why
do you love it and we compiled this list
of 10 legitimate ways that iPhones still
beat the competition even if I still
personally feel that their latest
refresh is incremental expensive and
boring thanks to LastPass for sponsoring
this video their password manager now
supports face ID on the latest iPhones
learn more at the end of the video
reason number one is security and
privacy and this has become one of
Apple's biggest talking points recently
and for good reason their long history
as a company might not be perfect but
they've taken some very bold steps in
the interest of protecting their
customers even refusing to comply with
FBI requests to unlock their customers
phones while Android is closing the gap
here in general iPhones are more secure
than Android devices where iPhones
deliver consistent Hardware based
security like the secure Enclave and the
now infamous USB restricted mode on
Android hardware based security varies
wildly between manufacturers with some
handsets even having been accused of
phoning home and providing user
information to third parties as for the
software
well base Android is open source which
theoretically would give it a security
advantage over Apple because anyone
could go in and examine the code for
vulnerabilities in practice though the
Android that ships on almost any device
that you can actually buy has been
modified by the manufacturer and those
changes are typically not open-source
furthermore the Google Play Store tends
to have more malicious apps on it due to
looser Submission criteria and even if
it didn't Android allows users to
install apps outside of the Play Store
an attack vector that simply doesn't
exist for iPhone users and one that is
actually currently in the process of
becoming normalized by companies like
Epic Games so they won't have to pay
Google a cut of their in-game purchase
revenue reason number two is
optimization the smartphone market has
matured to the point where Chinese
brands that you've never heard of are
making phones that legitimately aren't
complete garbage
yet Apple's deep integration between the
hardware and the OS continues to give
them a lead in speed stability and just
feeling smooth now Android fans will
complain
Appl cheaped out on the specs of their
phone but the cold hard truth is that
just because apples investment wasn't in
Moore DRAM chips to solder to their main
boards doesn't mean that they
necessarily cheaped out software
development costs real money and it's
not an accident that they get more out
of four gigs of RAM than others are
getting with ten and one more thing
their CPUs are at times as much as a
full generation ahead of the competition
Apple presses this advantage by offering
reason number three industry-leading
device support Apple's phones and
tablets get updates both for features
and security more quickly more
consistently and for longer than just
about any other mobile device on the
market and contrary to the general
perception that exists that Apple acts
with planned obsolescence in mind
forcing users to upgrade by slowing down
their old devices the last few updates
have actually had a lot of users
reporting that their old phone feels
snappier after the update the fact that
iPhones are so well optimized and
supported by Apple four years after
release contributes then to number four
longevity you can use your iPhone four
four five maybe even six years if you
stretch it it was actually only recently
that my iPad 2 finally stopped working
with enough apps that I actually care
about that I had to retire it and the
thing about this is that even if you
won't use your device for five years I
mean I suspect a lot of the people out
there watching this channel swap their
phones a little more frequently than
that you could which is part of what
helps customers justify the four digit
price tags on these things that and
iPhones hold their value better people
are still selling iPhone 6s for $200 how
much would you get today for your Galaxy
S five here's a hint
probably less than this broken iPhone 6
and they both came out in 2014 now yes
Apple did slow down phones with old
batteries without telling anyone but
considering that the longevity of the
hardware is one of their main selling
points I get why they didn't want to go
around shouting hey your old iPhones
battery sucks and so that's why we had
to slow it down a bit from the
mountaintops number five new apps often
launch first on iPhone and there are a
lot of interesting reasons for this
including device penetration in the u.s.
the propensity for iPhone users to spend
money and just plain old developer
preference but at the end of the day
none of those reasons really matter
because when I buy a phone it's
ultimately about the experience I'm
going to have and Android users often
have to wait longer whether it's for the
companion app for that Kickstarter you
backed a hot new social network like tbh
which managed to get big enough to be
acquired and then eventually shut down
by Facebook before it ever hit Android
or even a global phenomenon like
fortnight which only arrived on Android
in August despite being available on iOS
a full four months earlier bringing us
to at least one important app that is
never coming to Android iMessage my
message is objectively way better than
SMS there's group chats read receipts
stickers and it works over Wi-Fi so you
can use it across your devices even
without your sim installed all great
stuff and yes you could use whatsapp or
Facebook Messenger WeChat or just about
any chat app that you want for that and
emojis notwithstanding but the fact is
that I message like FaceTime is a
default that everyone with an iPhone has
and that gives it tremendous power I've
actually heard Android users complain
about missing out on events with their
friends because the invite only happened
to go out to the iMessage group chat and
as a techie how difficult it is to
convince iOS users to install
third-party chat apps might make my
brain hurt a little bit but here again
the reason I message is important
doesn't matter
it's all about the user experience and
people prefer it because why would you
want to switch when it works so well
with your other Apple devices you can
reply to messages from your MacBook and
secure code autofill super cool
it'll just grab that two-factor SMS from
your phone and plop it down directly in
your browser because that's right number
seven is the ecosystem your photos
messages and browsing history are synced
between your iPhone and MacBook
you've got Universal copy/paste you can
send files with airdrop instead of
trying to figure out if your friends
phone has NFC at all and if it does wear
exactly the stupid antennas aligned and
even I was blown away by how
legitimately pretty damn magical the
pairing processes for the air pods which
are an accessory and accessories are
reason number eight that's that wasn't
that bad right the thing about having a
large number of people out there using
the same device is that there's money to
be made making everything from cases to
gimbals to even personal massager okay
not not all of the iPhone accessories
make a ton of sense but the point is
when it comes to accessories iPhones do
give you more choice number nine is the
hardware mute button believe it or not
this is one of the few features that has
stuck around since the very first iPhone
and curiously hasn't been copied on mass
by other phone manufacturers oneplus
does include a similar three position
switch on their phones is actually kind
of the odd one out there with and the
weird thing is that it's not even
because they can't find a place to put
another button they just want it to like
some in Bixby or whatever the especially
funny thing here is that while most
people assume that Apple has the mute
switch patented or something we actually
couldn't find any evidence for that so
hit us up in the comments if you know
something that we don't know here
bringing us finally to number 10 setup
now both iOS and
right through your Apple ID and your
Google account respectively allow you to
transfer your apps and photos from your
old device to your new one but when it
comes to the smoothness of the
experience only some Android migrations
manage to retain system settings and app
icon placements like when you go from a
Samsung to a Samsung Apple does all this
stuff by default and for enterprise zero
touch deployments with Apple take the
cake again Apple's business manager
helps companies automate device
deployment delegate administrative
privileges and purchase apps in bulk so
that it's easy to manage user licenses
now that last one might not be a big
deal for you the individual employee but
this is about reasons to own an iPhone
and so it could be a big reason that you
are stuck with an iPhone for work even
if you'd prefer something else so the
final component of this video then is
just me wanting to set the record
straight once and for all
I don't hate Apple's devices and I don't
specifically hate the iPhone I have been
frustrated with some of the decisions
that they've made recently notably the
inclusion of a display knotch
and the removal of the headphone jack
particularly because the rest of the
industry is such a bunch of mindless
copycats
so whenever Apple goes and does
something that I disagree with I can
pretty much count on everyone else doing
the same thing within a product cycle or
two I also wasn't excited for the iPhone
10's and the 10s Macs in general and I
guess that's where I really ran into
trouble i I think I let myself get too
involved emotionally and while I do
stand behind the vast majority of what I
said and I even left out some big
frustrations that I realized as I was
sitting here about to shoot this video
including like of course they say it
doesn't work the missed opportunity how
is this not a fingerprint sensor touch
ID is awesome I love to touch any people
are like - you said you're such an apple
hater
he preys on touch ID how does this not
have an always-on display right sorry
this is the video but what's good
missing the ECM capabilities of the
iPhone 10s was one glaring omission that
I really feel bad about and so I just
want people to understand
that my criticisms came from a place of
love maybe not love for apple in general
or the iPhone in particular but of tech
I'm rooting for Apple I want to see them
continue to do great things and I really
hope that the iPhone xs2 knocks my socks
off and makes phones exciting again
because I think that's one thing that
the fan droids out there and the sheeple
can agree on phones have gotten a bit
boring lately and we really need
something to come in and shake up the
market so thanks again to LastPass for
sponsoring this video I've been using
LastPass for years now LastPass is a
password manager that relieves the
troubles of remembering your passwords
and reduces anxiety about getting locked
out of your counts and the hassle of
waiting around for password reset emails
you'll never need to write down remember
or reset a password again
LastPass allows you to keep track of
them so that you can stay sane and
secure and the best part is that it's
cross-platform it works on desktop it
works on mobile sites
it works for apps and it works on iOS
and Android whenever you open up an app
or a website LastPass will fill in your
username and password
making logging in simple and this was
such an amazingly pleasant surprise
actually can't believe I didn't include
it in my original review LastPass now
supports face ID with the iPhone 10 10 R
and 10 s as well as of course the 10s
max so all you have to do to unlock your
LastPass vault is use your face instead
of having to type your master password
it's freaking awesome and you can click
the link below to learn more about
LastPass so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked well you know what to
do but if it was awesome get subscribed
