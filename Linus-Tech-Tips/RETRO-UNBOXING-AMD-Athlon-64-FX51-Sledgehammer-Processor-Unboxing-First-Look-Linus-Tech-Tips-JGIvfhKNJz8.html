finally back to our traditional outdoor
unboxing location you can see it's
bright and sunny in Vancouver today I'm
going to be doing a retro unboxing I'm
going to be doing the Athlon 64 FX 51 I
actually found a brand new sealed FX 51
to give you some idea how old this is
check this out oh yeah
there's some dust for you and I think
the back of it is even worse can you you
can see the dust buildup you can like
right in it it's disgusting and we
should probably get this in the light to
make sure that then we're recording this
with the minnow HD which I already
unboxed just to have a look at the HD
recording quality of it okay so the FX
51 is a socket 940 processor but not the
940 that we noted a socket am3 it's the
socket 940 that existed at the same time
as socket 754 so back when the Athlon 64
was first released it was released on to
sockets 754 and 940 which was actually
an opto on server socket so the FX 51 is
I believe the only Athlon processor to
have ever been released on socket 940 it
is a single core and you know what
without getting too much further into
this why don't we break the seal on this
baby so let me see how we can get this
open and II hasn't used packaging like
this in years and I hardly even remember
how to open these I think there's like
there's some kind of a trick to it but
since I don't really care and I'm just
unboxing it why doesn't just go ahead
and slice it open make things simple on
ourselves okay so here we go this is
back like this is like a dinosaur heat
pipes didn't even like exist back then
so you can see that this cooler is just
like a thin cooler we're going to get
this out and have a look so inside it's
all nice and shiny and new this is a
brand new processor sort of so let's
have a look at the heatsink first this
is the Athlon 64 FX 51 heatsink
it has a huge copper base like this
thing is heavy that is one solid slab of
copper all the way around the bottom of
it it has a densely packed thin heat
sink for optimal heat dissipation
remember this processor does feature a
dual channel ddr3
state-of-the-art ultra hyper fastness
okay it has a three pin fan connector
alright most most heat sinks these days
included with CPUs now have four pin pwm
fan connectors AMD actually still does
use this latching mechanism although
it's been updated a little bit since
then so you use the clip arm on one side
and then you you push this down and then
use this clip to attach it like it looks
a little different but it's the same
basic idea the bottom is not lapped at
all so I'm doing my obligatory finger
reflection shot even in the bright Sun
that is not a very smooth base so the
the manufacturing processes for those
were a little bit different back then as
well let's see what else we've got in
here so I okay wow the CPU actually
comes with like a motherboard bracket it
would appear so I'm guessing that the
reason for that is that the only
motherboards that supported this chip
back in the day would have been server
Opteron motherboards
so you have to put an Athlon 64 bracket
on there so there you have it that's a
socket 939 backplate the only difference
between 939 and AM 2 and AM 3 in terms
of the back plate is at 939 had two
through holes and AM ex like all the am
sockets have four so they have one two
three four so that's a little bit
different but this layout is actually
very much the same they've gotten rid of
this fourth clip at this point so
includes a couple screws there let's see
what else we've got
alright Wow lots of documentation for a
processor here we go alright so why
don't we see ok so first of all it comes
with a three year limited warranty which
is long up at this point that's not even
relevant
oh let's see what the date on this is so
2003 Advanced Micro Devices
so it's been quite a while since this
has been on the market oh then we've got
like a big wow this is going to be
really big okay I can I can already tell
congratulations on your purchase of the
new AMD Athlon 64 FX TI b processor in a
box the best solution for to ensure full
compliance with AMD's limited warranty
heatsink and fan assembly included with
the processor must be used so just in
case the warranty was valid and there
you go you have to use it okay so they
give you full instructions and poster
size on how to install this processor
and holding up this white piece of paper
it's very bright they give us so place
the backplate gently lift the
motherboard edges over the backplate
just on the processor Wow even goes
around to the back step 9 step 10 step
11 this is a sixteen step program
apparently that allows you to install
this just look at that it has about
eight different languages okay
connect the fan okay so there you go
there's the instructions anyway and let
me see if I can sort of figure out how
to get this for me back up it's like
gonna go away in the wind here if I
don't do this now although I hate doing
stuff like this on camera because I
realize it's very boring for you people
alright let's see what else we got in
here next we have read this first record
the serial number of your processor
never handle the processor with the heat
sink fan installed or without it insult
okay that's in a bunch of different
languages so these are some warnings on
using your processor properly oh and
then we've got an Athlon FX sticker it's
like a metallic sticker it has metal
around the edges and yeah I remember
there was a time when that sticker
having that on your casement you had
like a thousand dollar processor in your
case or now I think the FX 51 wouldn't
be worth quite so much let me see what I
can so instant download of a 30 day
trial version of the latest video
encoding software cool do you think that
would still work I kinda doubt it oh no
there we go offer ends March 31st 2004
nice alright so now let's have a look at
the Athlon 64 FX itself so this is not
compatible with any modern socket
whatsoever it's a 940 and it's wow it's
quite a bit different looking than the
current chip so you can see that it
actually has like kind of a bluish
greenish grayish PCB under the heat
spreader itself and that you can see wow
the heat spreader is like shoddy almost
it's not even a straight line around the
edges can you see that on the camera
very hard to say because the minnow HD
has a pretty small screen but there's
all the printing that's on the heat
spreader and at the bottom we find 940
pins but not in the am 2 or am 3
configurations this is in the old 940
configuration anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing mull retro
unboxing of the AMD Athlon 64 FX 51</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
