the i5 family chips on the new LGA 1155
platform this one is the sort of value
option so the i5 2300 I'm gonna explain
how it stacks up compared to other i5
processors such as the 2500 K as well as
i7 processors such as the 2600 and the
2600 K Intel's lineup is honestly a
little confusing so pay close attention
for this next little bit here ok so this
is an LGA 1155 processor that means it
works on P 67 H 67 and z68 motherboards
okay
on H 67 it has onboard graphics on P 67
you can overclock for speed bins above
the max turbo speed so that should be up
I'm guessing here but I think it's about
3.6 gigahertz on this particular chip
please correct me if I'm wrong in the
comments and guys thumbs up on that
comment if I am mistaken about that one
okay because it is not unlocked the
turbo overclocking is slightly limited
okay so you have that going for it 2300
indicates the clock speed and also
because it is an i-5 it does not feature
hyper threading or the extra 2 Meg's of
cache for a total of 6 Meg's
for a total of 8 Meg's of cache on the
core i7s ok so let's do side-by-side
comparison with the 2500 K for example
which is more expensive ok to start with
so the 2500 K is clocked faster 2.8
versus 3.3 gigahertz the 2500 K because
it is an i5 also has 6 Meg's of cache
does not beat your hyper-threading ok
and the i5 2500 K because it has a K
designation is unlocked for maximum
overclocking whereas the 2300 is
actually hard limited to only that
maximum overclock that Intel specifies
you can achieve these both use the Oh
rather sorry because of the K
designation it also has slight
faster Intel HD graphics built-in versus
the HD graphics mm that is built into
the 2300 okay I hope that was all clear
they both have turbo boost and so yeah
turbo boost goes as far as you want here
and you are limited here next i 720 600
so neither of these are K processors
which means they are not overclocking
unlocked so you are limited you can do a
little bit of overclocking but not to
the max because this one is an i7
besides being clocked higher remember
it's a 2600 versus a 2300 that means
clock speed higher clock speed lower
clock speed it has 8 Meg's of cash
versus 6 Meg's of cash because this is
an i7 it also has hyper-threading which
gives you four virtual cores to go with
your for real course and that is pretty
much it because these are neither of
them K series processors they both have
HD graphics mm rather than the
full-fledged HD graphics 3000 now let's
get to the ruler of the roost the i7
2670 5 platform and let's compare these
guys so the 2600 K is clocked at the
same clock speed as the 2600 9k because
that's what that number means that
indicates clock speed because it's an i7
it has hyper-threading as well as an 8
meg has a 6 Meg cache on the 2300
because it is a K series processor it
has sorry about that guys batteries
because it is a K series processor it
has HD graphics 3000 verses HD graphics
2000 and it is fully unlocked for
maximum overclocking versus this one
being locked down significantly now bear
in mind that even though this I 5 has
limited overclocking potential compared
to any CPU that does not feature and
I'll show you guys where it says on the
box Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 so
this one has it and vs. any processor
that does not have that feature it can
still do more overclocking because any
chip that does not feature turbo boost
is completely
overclocking locked regardless of which
platform you are using it on and finally
another thing on the age 67 chipset you
can use the onboard video on here but
not any overclocking features a little
turbo boost will work normally you can't
go any further than the normal turbo on
AP 67 or Z 68 chipset you can do
overclocking but on P 67 the onboard
video is non-functional sorry I know
very very confusing okay we have it
heatsink it has a copper slug it has pre
applied thermal compound and it has an
80 millimeter fan with a four pin PWM
hookup we have a little thing here that
says you have a three year warranty it
has an Intel Inside logo and it has
installation instructions pay careful
attention to those installation
instructions they could save your life
or if not your life then at least your
CPU and motherboard next we have the
Intel Core i5 2300 so it looks just like
every other saw CPU on the LGA 1155
platform and for that matter it also
looks like every other CPU on the LGA
1156 platform other than the fact that
these two notches right here right there
can you see that and right there are in
a slightly different location versus LGA
1156 so thank you for checking out my
unboxing I really hope it wasn't too
confusing don't forget to subscribe to -
