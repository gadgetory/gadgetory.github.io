creative labs soundblaster was basically
synonymous with high performance high
quality gaming PC audio and they're
making a comeback but hold on - everyone
knows an external amp and DAC is the
best solution today this new flagship
sound card is dead on arrival no you
hold on
smartypants this time it's different
this sound card has built-in RGB
lighting this sound card is ready to
compete in 2017
the protrek smart from Casio features
Android 2.0 energy-efficient GPS
functionality water resistant up to 50
meters and more check it out now at the
link below so in a nutshell the Sound
Blaster X 85 is creative labs latest
attempt to marry a great DAC chip the
ESS Sabre 3290 18 and a great amplifier
circuit to a form factor that's
convenient for PC users if a little
unfamiliar to the younger generation so
taking a peek under the emi shield we
are greeted by the saber DAC right there
in the middle as well as this is
interesting all the main capacitors are
high-quality we move films and
interestingly while the rear Jack's are
all grounded to the bracket the
headphone jack is the one exception it's
grounded internally to reduce crosstalk
with the rest of the outputs cool of
course it's not quite as impressive
looking as the inside of a Modi 2 and
Magni to a popular standalone stereo DAC
and damp combo that enjoys the usual
advantages of these solutions
particularly very low interference
thanks to widely spaced PCB components
not to mention being outside the
computer case we did notice though that
shyt audios products used fewer film
capacitors and more giant electrolytic
s-- and we also noticed that they have
boring white LEDs on the front versus
creatives homegrown Aurora reactive
lighting system which is basically
individually addressable RGB lighting on
yet another damn separate piece of
software to install alongside are a sync
corsair link and razor Creelman
that and what a missed opportunity this
is it doesn't even have a music reaction
mode so we'd recommend just ham fisting
the proprietary connector on the
included strip onto an Asus header and
otherwise ignoring it I mean this is
supposed to be a sound card not an RGB
controller card like I'm I'm having
flashbacks to when they started putting
firewire ports and like joystick ports
onto sound cards
I'm thinking that that was also creative
so then the main attractions in creative
software package are the Blaster X
acoustic engine and Scout 2.0 most of
the acoustic engine is creatives usual
fare surround crystallizer bass smart
volume and dialogue plus crystallizer
can help with compressed streaming audio
and while dialog + sounds weird for
music it can help with other types of
content I will leave the rest of them
off but those two can be kind of useful
Scout 2.0 on the other hand completely
worthless it didn't give us better
spatial awareness than the conventional
surround setting and even worse than
that scout radar this phone app that if
it did work would be cheating anyway was
both distracting because you have to
look off screen to see it and horribly
inaccurate picking up our own footsteps
and ambient sound in csgo as a blip
straight ahead and usually failing to
register another player until they were
within a few digital feet relying on
this thing would be a great way to boost
your being knifed to kills ratio so how
about sound quality then well Anthony
grabbed a selection of headphones off of
our headphone wall along with the
aforementioned magnet 2 and moti 2 and
got to work using a Maximus 9 code as a
third comparison source to represent
good motherboard audio so early on in
the testing it became clear that both
the 85 and a su supreme effects can
drive even notoriously difficult to
drive planar dynamic headphones like The
Odyssey LCD 2's and the 250 ohm bear
dynamic DT 990 probes and both of them
at uncomfortable listening volumes even
unsurprisingly though so does our Magni
and modi combo which is good because
that's the entire reason it exists so
everybody's a winner so far audio
quality was a different story
even without the surprisingly easy to
use brought the way you wanted EQ
highs are crisper and lows are smoother
than our onboard audio which is
especially apparent in electronic music
where high pitched cymbals and snare
drums sounds notably coarse by
comparison rock and metal sound
significantly less noisy which is to say
that everything doesn't devolve into a
mess of riffs and cymbals as happens
with lower quality outputs and meanwhile
symphonic music sounds quite a bit
smoother and fuller
with that said comparing the 85 to our
only slightly more expensive it
comes pretty close on both of them are a
significant improvement over onboard and
I'd say the edge especially in quieter
passages goes to
now obviously the 85 has the advantage
of not taking up any additional desk
space that is to say as long as your mo
isn't to take it and put it on a desk in
front of you and talk about it to a
camera it also though has a one less
obvious drawback that is unless you want
to use your cases often very poorly
shielded front panel audio jacks you'll
need a long headphone cable to plug into
the dedicated headphone jack on the rear
i/o so bottom line then once upon a time
filling up all your expansion slots was
like the mark of a baller system and
that's not lost on me here what is
though is the fact that something like
this has one very specific purpose to be
plugged into a compatible computer
meanwhile external sound solutions are
more versatile DAX are usually
driverless and cross-platform and amps
can be plugged into virtually anything
with an output so I guess the answer
then boils down to how much you value
three things creative software including
yes the RGB controls they're 7.1
surround support and whether you're like
into filled up PCIe slots anchors power
delivery charging enables faster and
safer charging as well as more power for
your larger devices and USB see connect
are super handy because they allow you
to use the same cable to charge your
smartphone tablet and even a supported
laptop with no separate power brick
required so today we're looking at two
products with these features the power
core plus 26800 as well as the power
port speed PD 30 both of them have a USB
C port that can deliver up to 30 watts
as well as up to two regular USB ports
they've got hard-wearing matte exteriors
this one's made of aluminum which is
pretty nice with high-gloss detailing
and these kind of cool blue USB ports to
provide a sleek look the foldable plug
and compact size means that you can take
them with you wherever you want to go
and you can check them out through the
