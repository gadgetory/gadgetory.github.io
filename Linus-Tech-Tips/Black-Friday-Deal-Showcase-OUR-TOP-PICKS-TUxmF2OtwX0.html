cool proposition they were like hey
here's an idea
lioness why don't you pick out a bunch
of products that you think your audience
will like and we'll put them on sale for
Black Friday so immediately we thought
hey why not build an entire new rig
where each and every component is on
sale then we kicked it up a notch and
decided to do not one but two builds one
for the Intel fans and one for all you
lovable team red Rascals so here is our
Black Friday shopping guide for the
completely custom black and orange
Friday on newegg.com
now CPUs are most often discounted as
part of a bundle but not this time new
egg is knocking 30 bucks off of
everyone's favorite chip for single
threaded workloads the core i5 7600 K
and $40 off the 7700 K which will be
just 300 the reason these deals are so
juicy is that kb lake even though it's
still under a year old is no longer
current gen for the AMD fans
Rison is on sale but at a smaller
discount since they're already quite a
bit less to begin with you can get 10
bucks off of two of our top picks the
risin 5 1600 and the risin 7 1700 X now
the prices in this video are subject to
change as we get closer to Black Friday
but we've been guaranteed that they
won't be any higher than we say here so
I kind of hope they change but no matter
which of those chips you choose the
course our H 100 IV to 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler will keep it
nice and cool and it's on for just 85
bucks this is a great cooler for the
price but just bear in mind that the am
for socket mounts arrives in are sold
separately from Corsairs website
speaking of sockets you can pair your kv
lake processor with an asus prime z 270
+ motherboard for a hundred and twenty
bucks meanwhile AMD folks can look
forward to spending even less this asus
be 350 board supports overclocking and
is just $69 my favorite amount of money
now it might seem counterintuitive but
we're recommending different Ram kits
for Rison and Intel either kit should
work in your build if you go the other
way just potentially not at their
advertised speeds the intel tuned kit is
16 gigs of RGB Corsair Vengeance Ram
available for one eighty nine ninety
nine and then representing maybe the
best deal of the day is the rise in
tuned 16 gig kit of G skills flair x4
one seventy nine ninety nine when it
comes to graphics you may have heard
that an AMD GPU works better with an AMD
processor but that is actually a big fat
myth so from here on out no matter what
parts you've chosen so far your build
will be compatible with the rest of the
stuff in the
Guide for the green gamers the su Strix
gtx 1070 at 4:29 and if your blood flows
red you can get a gigabyte rx Vega 56 at
409 99 or 3 89 99 if you can be arsed to
do the mail-in rebate
like Ram man flash is currently going
through a global shortage and supply so
10 bucks off a 500 gig Samsung 850 Evo
internal SSD is about the best we can do
for you the good news is if you're the
type to you know take your time and save
for the moment you can get a slower 4
terabyte hard drive from Seagate for $25
off for your power supply and EVGA
supernova 850 g2 is a great option it's
fully modular 80 plus gold certified
completely overpowered and a pretty
screaming deal at 99 bucks then for your
case the corsair 400 C is a bargain any
time but it's you know slightly more
bargain II on Black Friday at just 69.95
I see might as well get it like 2 or 3
so it's cheaper than a night stand from
Ikea for peripherals we're recommending
a keyboard and mouse combo from Logitech
you can get the G 403 wired gaming mouse
and g2 13 keyboard for $69.99 which is
basically buy one get one for 10 bucks
total score there and then you can get
similar savings on one of the best value
headsets out there the HyperX cloud twos
now only the red ones are on sale but I
mean come on they're not even that red
so bring us to the display you can get
this 24 inch 144 Hertz display from msi
for 220 down from 250 and an extra 20
bucks off with a mail-in rebate it's got
free sync so it would be perfect for
your AMD build but if you've got an
Nvidia card free sync won't help you
much and if that's tearing up your heart
you can get a similarly spec to gsync
monitor from Acer for about a hundred
and fifty bucks more putting it all
together then our Intel builds are
hovering it just around the $2,000 mark
for everything
while the AMD builds are 1650 and 1750
but these price differences aren't so
large once we ditched the poor
frills and just look at the tower
overall the rise in five build is the
most heavily discounted and looks like a
killer value and the best part is you
can order everything here online in your
underwear with zero risk of being killer
by a stampede of crazed shoppers so
