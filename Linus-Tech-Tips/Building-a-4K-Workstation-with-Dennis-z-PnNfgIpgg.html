recent events here Atlantis media group
that have serendipitously collided the
first is that our search for a new
graphic designer is over the LMG Squad
has a new member and this person
naturally will need a high-performance
workstation that they can use to design
vector graphics and it videos and
potentially create animations and the
second is that LG reached out to us to
sponsor a video about their new 27 UK
850 monitor it's 4k its HDR and it looks
like a great match for our new graphic
designer so you see where I'm going with
this so we decided to use this monitor
in this sponsored video to build a
workstation for this guy whose face and
name will remain secret because he's not
past his probation yet
I'm really liking the look of this
monitor it's got the thin bezels that
we've come to expect from LG on all
sides which enhances the immersion
factor it's got a 3840 by 2160 4k
resolution with 315 a typical brightness
and on the back it's got a textured
white finish and a slim stand with 110
millimeters of hide adjust and 25
degrees of tilt which unfortunately we
are not going to be able to see or use
once we attach it to our crate case
alright so as not necessarily an expert
on you know creative workstations I've
brought in well I think expert would be
a strong word Dennis thank you for
volunteering wait that's that person no
I'm building this PC for no no surprise
so if you guys watched recently Dennis
did claim in his PC building simulator
you know PC building debut that he could
build a normal computer just fine it was
limitations of the software that held
him back I know how to be in real life I
know how to do it of course of course
so Dennis why don't you start us off
here with our CPU so we're gonna be
using a 79 80 Excel for several use I
know you had you touch it no I know I
know we can put it here oh oh okay
there's no plastic thing okay yeah
that's fine that's fine I feel like this
is more like kindergarten class no I'm
the triangle who's it this is trying I
know this may be like that
okay turn it no no no okay this way okay
you put the size of a rice I've seen the
video like a big rice bigger eyes
yeah thick your eyes like bloated rice
yeah cuz this is a big CPU that's what
your rice looks like you see long rides
I know yeah so you have to open the clip
first I know I know I didn't do that in
the videos but I know that's not oh
that's an SSD no I know that I think
that looks different this is the click
sound just make a sound effect you know
no okay stop it I'm not acting this is
really hot out there I don't think
you're acting oh no no no this way ha ha
ha ha I know it Linus don't you I would
never laugh at you I'm laughing with you
got it got it got it more accurately I'm
laughing with the viewers they are
laughing they are learning how to be a
PC with me yeah just like that just like
can see building simulator good good
collect okay uh how much time do we have
in here we have we have four rims I
don't want to do the math again okay
ready
now we add our HDR monitor so I can lay
that down
Boop not on any screws hopefully they do
that wait wait doesn't fit
is this something wait this doesn't go
on that side that's okay nice this is
like bad
Oh guys going mm this is C you are wrong
I said we were wrong IDI say you was
right yes
seems like such a waste to get rid of a
like stand that looks like this for one
that yeah compared to this like that but
this way we can have the computer
clipped onto it okay so you're gonna put
it on and we're coming through this
you're gonna do the honors make sure you
got a good angle and Casey drops at
Brennan at the very least we want to
capture it on camera I'm not going to
drop this for sure yes this is Ian wait
it's not only the top is on you miss
Luxx
I was kind of it go no you missed out
come can you look at it from the side do
you see how the hooks go okay oh my god
oh my god yes yes yeah your honor
Wow so believe it or not this
workstation is actually more powerful
than your editing workstation really yep
okay so we are making a couple of
compromises we can't especially access
the i/o which is kind of a shame because
it's got two HDMI one DisplayPort
all supporting HDR it's got a USB type-c
with 60 watts of power so you can like
run your laptop on the side actually
that would be a pretty cool idea just
having it plugged in permanently and
just having like a wire like velcro here
or something that you could run your
laptop off it yeah but I mean you lose
height adjust and stuff but still one
piece
full workstation now it's time for us to
test out the HD arnis we made our own
all-in-one Dennis yeah okay let's find
out how good it is for productivity then
wow it's actually better than my editing
machines is check out that that
real-time 8k footage scrubbing in full
at full not bad eh
keep playing you can really see my hair
thinning at 8k so what we're looking at
here is a testing code at 4k for upload
to YouTube and wow that is really darn
speedy sorry Dennis but this is way
better than your machine so we're making
this for the new designers there his
desktop background desktop desktop desk
desktop there you go and once he saw
this he will know why we need to hire
him there's a new desktop get that
picture google it it's I just have it on
my phone what is this what you also have
a vessel actually yes and why Wow now
given this as a workstation it's
probably not going to come up that often
but other than playing back HDR videos
HDR gaming is one of the biggest use
cases for HDR and you can clearly see
that it's working in Deus Ex mankind
divided here this benchmark looks
noticeably better on an HDR display than
it does on an SDR display now with that
said in HDR mode sometimes you do run
into some odd behavior like for example
this thumbnail for Austin's iPhone 10
video which happens to be an HDR video
is not HDR so like the thumbnail looks
weird but then the video itself is gonna
be running in HDR so there you have it
overall I'm really pleased with this
nice
compact little workstation that we
managed to put together it is definitely
a little bit on the heavy side but you
can't really blame the monitor for that
I guess that's why they stopped making
cases out of thick steel or cast iron or
whatever else the case may be we ended
up with really nice cable management and
hopefully they really liked it and are
especially proud of having a system
built by the one and only Dennis V ow
it worked so it's fine I think you will
love it so thanks for watching guys if
