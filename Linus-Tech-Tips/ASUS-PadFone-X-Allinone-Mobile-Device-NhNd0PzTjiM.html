tendency for different technological
systems to evolve towards performing
similar tasks sometimes it happens
smoothly and naturally like the way that
standalone pager devices became a basic
feature on every cell phone other times
whether it's because the industry is
trying to do something before the
technology is really ready or because a
loan manufacturer is trying to shoehorn
in features that just don't make any
sense this process feels more like a
science experiment gone wrong than
something that you should spend your
hard-earned money on so what is the asus
padfone x is it the next natural step in
the evolution of phones and tablets that
sees them ultimately become one device
or is it a Frankenstein monster that
makes no sense and needs to be put down
let's find out shall we
the jazz mini phone and tablet stand
from Coolermaster is now available in a
variety of cool colors from these great
retailers click now to learn more so
let's start with the phone part of the
PadFone X it's a flagship class smart
phone with all the usual fixes a
surprisingly bright high contrast and
generally beautiful 5-inch 1080p IPS
Plus display dominates the front of the
device with only an earphone speaker a
mundane 2 megapixel selfie camera a
notification LED and a shiny logo to
distract from it onto the edges the
trapezoid profile shape makes it easier
for me to grip than other similarly
large phones on the top we find a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack and a
noise cancelling mic on the right the
lock and volume buttons are easy to
press on purpose while being difficult
to press by accident with nothing on the
opposing side of the device to
accidentally mash and on the bottom is
one of the most snug micro USB
connectors I've ever encountered which
has the stealth benefit of actually
being a my DP slim port that supports up
to 1080p 60fps video output over
DisplayPort HDMI or VGA with a cheap
passivity not quite as drippy as I'd
like removable plastic backing a 13
megapixel still camera a standard 1 tone
flash and unfortunately rear mounted
speaker I'm going to keep harping on
this until everyone moves in to the
front and two logos including an AT&amp;amp;T
one yes this is an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive device
the u.s. taking this off reveals a
micro-sim slot and microSD expansion
slot and a beefy non removable 2300
milliamp hour battery that I easily got
a day plus out of while I was using it
then on the underside of the cover we
see contacts for NFC with Isis mobile
wallet support and PMA wireless charging
ASIS shipped me a replacement backing
with an integrated screen cover but I
actually prefer naked phones in general
and the build quality of it was nothing
special and unless you open up the cover
first it actually doesn't even fit into
the included tablet accessory so I
didn't use it which gives me a great
opportunity to talk about just how well
this dock mechanism works between the
textured low friction surface against
the screen the combination of soft touch
rubber grips and plastic guides on the
sides and the long microUSB and dual
prong system that penetrates the phone
from the bottom it works surprisingly
well it's easy to slip in and easy to
take out but it won't come out by
accident and it achieves this without
needing a kludge e locking switch or
anything like that full marks for how
they go together but of course the pad
part of the pad phone if it sucks then
you're unlikely to use it anyway so
let's take a look around it shall we
like the phone the overall build quality
is nothing groundbreaking it's got a
simple plastic backing and an unbranded
glass front instead of the Corning Glass
on the phone itself there's a forty nine
ninety milliamp hour battery inside that
can just charge the phone charge the
phone while powering up the tablet or
allow the tablet and phone to share
battery life with each other
intelligently on the outside there's a
lock button a volume rocker a 1
megapixel selfie camera I guess you'll
do your video calling with it out of the
dock to adequately loud front-facing
speakers and finally the 8-inch 1920 by
1200 IPS screen whose job it is to
convince potential customers to buy this
two-in-one device instead of a
standalone phone the good news here is
that it gets plenty bright colors look
great and unlike most phone makers Asus
actually gives us some cool tools for
adjusting the look of the screen and the
phone with their splendid app and
overall works darn well other than
having sort of wider bezel
and I would have liked to see which
leads us into the software pre-loaded
app wise on top of splendid you get some
AT&amp;amp;T stuff a sound tweaking app a power
profile adjusting app that lets you
tweak screen brightness depending on
what's running and a file manager that
doesn't seem particularly exceptional
but save me the trouble of installing ES
file manager I guess or Explorer rather
but that's not what you really wanted to
know you want to know about the skin
that asus is running over android 4.4.2
it's alright I guess overall
responsiveness is solid but I found the
keyboard laggy and quickly replaced it
was fifth key multitasking is snappy but
there text highlighting feels slow and
my on-screen buttons disappeared
sometimes the dialer and SMS apps are
simple to use but I don't really like
some visual design elements like the
notification pulldown that looks out of
place with a light blue and white color
scheme so in summary again it's alright
I guess they thankfully didn't change
much interaction wise so there's like no
other random crap in the Google now
swipe up like LG's done with the g3 but
the question this all raises then is why
bother changing anything then why not
just go the mostly stock Android route
that Nvidia and Motorola have gone and
just build in the functionality that you
need to differentiate your device
because they do have that their dynamic
display technology allows your home
screens and even certain apps to switch
between tablet and phone view on the fly
when you dock the phone it's fast and
allows the two device modes to feel
different from each other like separate
home screen layouts for example while
still being the same device with all
your content available in moments
noticed I was surprised at how well it
worked with certain things like the
browser and SMS app but it's
unfortunately not compatible with Google
Apps or really many third-party apps
like games so often you'll find yourself
reading apps as you switch modes
thankfully it does that pretty quickly
though onto the camera a soos brags a
fair bit about it in their reviewers
guide but I didn't really find it that
special
it supports the usual exotic modes like
720p 120 FPS slow-motion with audio
thankfully and 4k recording I'll be
added only twelve fps but while I Suz
did a good job of staying true to life
without over saturating colors like some
other manufacturers and the app offers a
basically deep amount of configuration
the image quality with the phone set to
auto how I do most of my phone shooting
didn't take my breath away I'll put some
comparison test shots versus the one I
made in the iPhone 5s and the pricing
discussion link in the video description
which you'll be able to check out soon
we're almost done here but first a look
at a couple of the optional accessories
that a soos sent over for the tablet
this tablet cover is just plain not very
good don't buy it and this keyboard
needed a bit more work the hinge is all
metal and feels really well constructed
but it's heavy and the tablet slips out
of it fairly easily when opening and
closing it because it doesn't actually
lock on and win anyway
and on top of that it's actually just a
bluetooth keyboard
that needs to be charged separately in
everything which is disappointing coming
from the creator of the much more
elegant transformer series of tablets
but all of that could have been forgiven
if the layout wasn't so bad I understand
they eliminated a column of keys here
but who decided that Chevron's and
braces should be accessed with shift and
question mark apostrophe and quotations
should be accessed with the unnaturally
position function key that is a
deal-breaker on what is otherwise a
pretty useful tool considering how much
more productive you can be with a
trackpad and a full keyboard on Android
which leads us to conclusion time if you
want both a phone and a tablet there are
better standalone devices that can be
obtained separately for the same price
off contract with the added bonus of
being able to be used separately at the
same time this is just a dummy on its
own but what those other devices can't
do is be perfectly in sync with the
PadFone X your apps your data plan and
even your battery life with their
various charging modes can be balanced
and shared across your phone and tablet
experience it's unlike anything else
that I've used before but not everyone
buys devices off contract and this can
be obtained for 200 bucks with a
two-year plan so if I was going to sign
up for a new AT&amp;amp;T deal in spite of it
being a little bit thick and having
build quality it feels kind of last gen
I would have to recognize that the
features and versatility of the PadFone
X make it a serious contender and I'm
definitely excited to see what comes
next because I really like the overall
concept and I think with
little bit more refinement this can be
one freaking awesome combo type device
thanks for watching guys like or dislike
the video according to how you felt
about it leave a comment if you have
something to say about the pad for us I
mean do you think a tablet phone combo
device makes sense for the future I'd
love to hear what you guys think I do
read the comments on my videos you know
also I guess the last thing that I
usually say it's right in the video
description you can buy a t-shirt you
can give us a monthly contribution or
you can support us in the easiest
possible way by changing your amazon
