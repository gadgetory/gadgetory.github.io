I think probably like 80% of the people
with a wireless network at home need
even if they don't already know that
they need it this is the re 1000
Wireless and range extender and now how
many times at your house
have you gone you know sort of just out
of range of your wireless network like
maybe you're sitting on the patio or
maybe you're in your garage working on
something and in frustration you see
that you've got like one bar of wireless
strength and then you try to transfer a
file and it drops out and it doesn't
work I mean really you can't blame the
wireless because you put so many
obstacles like walls and cars and small
crying children in between your router
and your device and you're gonna run
into reception problems so this is from
Cisco or Linksys by Cisco I should say
this is a way to easily increase
wireless network coverage throughout
your home or business or wherever you
want wireless network coverage even in
your car if you wanted to although it
would only work when you're close to
your router which is at home okay home
fine so 2.4 gigahertz Bend Ethernet
bridge advanced security and easy setup
the Cisco advantage cutting-edge
technology from the networking leader
yeah they're pretty undisputed their
best-in-class security okay
award-winning 24/7 customer support and
the one-year limited warranty
broad compatibility works seamlessly
with all b/g/n Wi-Fi devices cool so I
don't even need a Cisco or a Linksys
router in order to get this to work
flexible placement all you do is plug
into a wall outlet or desktop placement
options to optimize okay cool easy setup
we've talked about that push button
security for Wi-Fi Protected setup WPS
fast ethernet built in and quality of
service delivers smooth video and gaming
performance awesome so here's a little
diagram but let's talk about the diagram
after Oh hold on
ideal for enjoying at it in-home
mobility surfing the web gaming and
chatting online in hard-to-reach areas
and fine
easily connecting to an Internet ready
TV or blu-ray player so let's open it up
unboxing - tech tips okay so we find a
bracket we find power court oh okay
got it nice long power cord look at this
it's approximately one Linus arm spanned
in length and then we have an Ethernet
cable which I will check the length for
you as well with my convenient and easy
to replicate units of measurement let's
see what shall I use as a unit of
measurement today maybe I'll use em NCIX
and land-use okay approximately how many
NCIX lanyards long is this looks like
about three and a half e and c IX
lanyards in length for that particular
Ethernet cable also known as six feet no
four feet okay I'm not even gonna try
and guess real user measurement not that
I really consider imperial units to be
really units of measurement but you know
that's a whole other argument here we
have the actual wireless and range
extender unit itself you got a little
illuminated Cisco logo right about there
you've got the two mounting options that
they do talk about - the one is you take
this guy right here the throw right here
there you go and then you are plugging
that into the wall and that's your range
extender there's your WPS one touch
setup button
there's your reset switch if you need to
do a hard reset on the bottom of the
unit there is your 10 100 fast ethernet
port and if you do not want to use that
option you can also throw this guy on
here
there you go and then you can plug in
the power cord and that might get you
that little bit of extra reach maybe you
want to like plug it in at the bottom
and then put it up on like a windowsill
so that you get better range in your
backyard now before we go any further on
this because I think that's pretty much
all there is to say about it know
there's some documentation so there's a
set up CD so you're gonna want to
actually you might want to use this just
because it's gonna make life a little
bit easier in terms of configuration for
this guy the one place in the center
here tips for successful setup so this
is what I was just about to talk to you
I talked about avoid placing the
extender or associated router or access
point near metal objects reflective
surfaces and masonry walls okay
place the extender close to the router
or access point during initial setup
then move the extender to its final
location after setup and for the best
positioning of your extender test in
multiple locations now what Cisco hasn't
mentioned or Linksys or Cisco I don't
know one of the two links is what
Linksys hasn't mentioned about this
product is that it's imperative that you
do not place it where the reception is
bad because if you take this device and
let's say you want to have access in the
garden and you put it in the garden
thinking that no it's gonna like create
a wireless signal doesn't work that way
you have this is a wireless client so
you have to put this where it's gonna
get good reception rather than where it
has a bad reception already so I'm gonna
diagram this up for you guys I'm gonna
like find a pen somewhere hold on hold
on
I'm gonna find a pen in the have a
closer look at the access point which is
fascinating okay so here's your house
pardon my terrible drawing that's your
house this is your garage with your car
in it oh wow okay there you go with your
car in it and then on the second floor
you have your wireless router that
represents a wireless router that little
box right there okay so let's say this
is the range of your wireless router
you're in the garage and you're like
rageface you know like ah this kind of
face okay because you can't quite reach
so instead of putting your extender
right here where it's also not gonna
have reception you want to throw your
extender like over here like you know
maybe out a window here or something
like that so basically what you're doing
is you're taking that range and you're
making you just a little bit bigger
that's the point
so there you go thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look and
positioning guide on the re 1000 from
