our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
something I haven't looked at before
this is the galaxy camera so it's
available in white or black and to put
it simply it is a very small tablet with
an awesome camera built into it instead
of being something like a smartphone
with a camera sort of added as an
afterthought I mean all the camera guys
want to talk about or all the phone guys
want to talk about how great the camera
on their phone is the reality of it is
its optics its physics unless it has a
bigger sensor with a bigger lens it's
not going to be that much better there's
only so much you can do digitally so it
runs Android jelly bean out-of-the-box
which means that it looks just like any
other Android device that runs
phenomenally smoothly actually that
looks outstanding so we're going to go
ahead and yeah you can you know run it
on a browser it's available as a 3g
version with 18t down here in the States
no idea what they're doing in Canada at
this point but you can get it with Wi-Fi
only as well so you have okay where's
the internet browser there you go the
thing about a connected device like this
what makes it so powerful as things like
automated upload stay Instagram or
Facebook don't worry it'll ask you first
and all of the stuff that they can do
software wise that you can't do with a
regular camera I mean you can update the
firmware on a camera think about this
that's something camera guys have just
ignored the opportunity to add extra
functionalities of their devices after
release or fix bugs after release for
devices with Android we can do almost
anything and you can count on
third-party app developers to do all
kinds of cool stuff with a device like
this so they've got lots of smart photo
taking modes which give you things like
beauty face which automatically touches
up your complexion best photo is
actually really cool so this one takes a
8 snapshots so I can kind of go like
this and then hold it still for the last
one and it's going to go okay tap and
hold thumbnail okay it's going to
suggest you one that it thinks is the
best and then we can see that it
actually didn't like these blurry ones
so you
actually manually override which one you
think is the best save one and it'll
totally discard the rest of them some of
the other cool nodes are the does a
burst fire mode that does 20 shots of
continuous shooting best faces need it
actually allows you to take what is it
five in best face five invest face and
you can sub in so it's outside getting
what here we're just going to take
pictures of these guys here so if
someone ruins the picture by making kind
of a goofy face in one of the shots it's
great if you have like ten plus people
in an image you can go okay I want to
replace it with this one I think that
one was a little bit better and just
like that it'll actually go ahead and
replace that for you so that's very very
cool stuff as well if you want more
manual modes you can go into expert and
you've got a lot of the functionality
that you'd see on a physical camera but
you're controlling it all digitally
instead so diesel got pretty excited
about this particular feature pop-up
flash right here means that you're not
going to be limited by the cheesy flash
that's integrated into your phone
anymore it actually has a flash very
very good stuff so I think that pretty
much covers it they're not going to
probably like this in the Samsung booth
here but I'm gonna do my obligatory
iphone size comparison so you guys can
see exactly how big it is for yourselves
I think I'm getting I'm getting a look
right now but the reality is everyone
knows how big an iphone 4 is so that
tells you all you need to know about the
size thanks guys and don't miss any of
