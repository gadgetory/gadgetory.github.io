Dell's groundbreaking
8k monitor
the last time i checked out one of these, was on a
crowded show floor and to say that that one was a little
pre-production, would be an understatement.
But, Dell has been hard at work for
months on their aptly named
UP321 8K
and the finished product
is now in our hands for evaluation
as a content creation device,
a content consumption device, and
last but not least, we uh
might fire up some games on it
Synergy is the software that lets you share your
mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.
Check it out now at the link in the video desciption.
Wait for it
*waauughh, waugh, wau*
*more inaudible noises*
PWAaatch goh- I'm going too early
Here we go, it's alive
8k resolution at 60 Hertz.
Everything about
the ultra-sharp UP321 is either state of the art
like the aluminium built quality, hyper
thin infinity edge key embezzles
and glass front OR it makes
state of the art look
like an antique. The specs of this thing
are absolutely unreal. It comes
tuned out of the box with an individual
calibration report that promises Delta E values
of less than 2 and full
yes, one-hundred percent
coverage of the Adobe RGB
colorspace. It's got 400
nit-peak brightness, which is rock solid
for a non-HDR panel, though a little more on that later.
And a static contrast ratio of thirteen-hundred
to one; which is outstanding
for an IPS panel type.
But that ignores the most obvious
calling card of this utterly unique
product.The 8K resolution
10 bit, 60 Hertz
panel. I mean, this is so
far out ahead of the curve,
that we don't even have a display interface that can handle it yet.
Like, early 4K displays
with display port 1.1 input
it needs 2 connections
to the computer to run at its
maximum 60 Hertz refresh rate, but
there's a big difference; these
are display port 1.4
ports. Well hold on a minute Linus,
DP1.2 can handle 4K 60 Hertz
no problem, and 1.4 has about
double that bandwidth.
Why do we need 2 of those?
Aaahahhh hahah; because 8K
is more than twice as many pixels as 5K
4 times as many as 4K,
and a whopping 16 times
the pixel count of 10 ADP.
We're talking thirty-three
megapixels, 60 times
per second. And until
video card makers implement DSC
or Display Stream Compression,
the only way to push this many pixels is gonna be to add
more cords. I have some
good news too, though. Dell
has a lot of experience building high-end displays
and it really shows,
unlike early dual-input 4K monitors
there's no flakiness, where
half of the display looks a little different
from the other half, or where one side
will refuse to turn on sometimes. In fact, you can even
just yank out one of the cables
and the only effect that you'll see
is that the entire display will now be running at 30 Hertz
instead of 60; and from what I've seen
plugging it back in is an equally seamless
transition. And all of this experience carries over
to the physical design as well. In spite of the
panel's weight,
heat, and power consumption characteristics
they managed an internal power supply
with passive cooling and all
the creature comforts that creatives are used to.
