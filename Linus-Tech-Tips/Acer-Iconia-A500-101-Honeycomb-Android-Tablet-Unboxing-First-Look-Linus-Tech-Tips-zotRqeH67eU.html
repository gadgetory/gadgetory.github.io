the Acer Iconia Tab now this one is
actually from the NCIX inventory and the
reason that I am unboxing this
particular unit is that the customer who
purchased it asked me to unbox it before
they picked it up so here I am alright
so why don't we have a look at what
we've got in terms of features so we
have a wide viewing angle okay Wi-Fi
certified Bluetooth GPS 5 megapixel
camera HDMI and micro sd so that gives
us a couple of hints in terms of the
overall feature stats that we're gonna
see with the Iconia Tab now this is a
honeycomb NVIDIA Tegra 2 tablet so it's
got a similar overall spec to what we've
seen with many of the other tablets that
I have recently unboxed alright and what
else do we have on the back here ok here
we go so it uses Android Honeycomb
Android so it comes with 3.1 I believe
it doesn't matter because you can
upgrade it later it has a dual-core 1
gigahertz Tegra 2 ultra-low power
GeForce GPU this is a 32 gig this
particular one here although it is
available in other capacities we've also
got a 10.1 inch LCD screen 2 megapixel
rear camera with 2 megapixel front 5
megapixel rear camera with 2 megapixel
front camera also the rear camera has
autofocus and LED flash Wi-Fi n
Bluetooth microSD rechargeable lipo
battery and oh look at that they put a
milliamp hour rating on it so 30 to 60
million powers just so you guys know
because remember power consumption is
going to be fairly similar between
tablets with the same spec the same
screen size the same general hardware
specifications ok so the box inside we
have black box materials we've also got
a little tab here which will allow us to
lift up the Iconia tap so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys what we have in
terms of accessories so first start
information here about plugging
something into something ok oh it comes
with a cleaning cloth look at that they
call it a notebook cleaning cloth but
I'm sure you can clean your job
- we have a QuickStart guide as well as
a passport so I guess the task port you
know I'm not gonna worry too much about
that QuickStart guide really as far as
Android goes you can find any
information you're going to need online
in terms of how to's and setup guides
all that good stuff okay we've got an
included AC adapter so you can see it
comes with the North American plug which
goes into one of these universal guys
I'm starting to see more of these versus
having specific AC adapters per region
so I mean personally I think it's smart
it's less waste it's less tooling and
then you can just use these little these
little clips in order to make them
compatible with the walls in various
regions so here we have a USB cable so
that's your data cable and then yeah
data in power is covered with those two
adapters there so here we go here's the
unit itself and let's see if there's
anything that we have to adhere so doble
dope Dolby dual bmobile
okay wide viewing angle that's good to
know what megapixel micro SD okay so
let's go ahead and take off the
protective plastic hopefully the
customer won't mind since you asked me
to unbox it hopefully he knows that you
know if that means I will open it I mean
I guess you could complain I guess that
would be a strange thing to do the build
at this one looks quite nice so here
let's start with the locations of
everything so here is the front camera
alright here is the screen so it is an
Android tablet so that means you are
going to be using a software screen so
unlike the iPad 2 which I like having
out here just for context which does
have one hardware button on it none of
the Android tablets have like a hardware
home button or anything like that it's
all gonna be in software here alright
let's move along to the side so there's
our power button I've tried pressing
that a couple times but it looks like
this particular tablet does not come
with a charge on it oh there goes it's
turning on
there's our headphone jack there is a
phone call I think this is micro HDMI
please correct me if I'm wrong on that
one
this is not mini-hdmi this is the other
more different term hdmi all right on
the bottom we find a dock connector on
the side we find a hard reset switch
this right there that little switch
could end up being worth its weight in
gold I actually had one of the other
Android 3.1 tablets do a hard lock on me
fortunately it was the Toshiba Thrive
which has a removable battery so I was
able to take the back panel off and
remove the battery in order to hard
reset it but this one actually has a
hard reset so even though you can't pull
the battery you do have that option
there as well so that's really good to
see we've got a full size USB 2 port
that's pretty nice as well as the USB
port for transferring data to the tablet
next we have our DC power in and let's
move over to the top okay on the top
we're gonna find what is it all
likelihood where the micro SD card goes
yeah there we go
so there's your micro SD slot down there
and finally that's the that's pretty
slick actually that goes in that lens
and really nicely finally we have I
guess that's a screen orientation lock
would be my guess I haven't seen this
switch underneath the other Android
tablets and then finally we have a
volume rocker so process system is not
responding okay force closed so there it
is I don't want to get too far into the
user setup process because this actually
will belong to someone but oh yeah
where's the camera sorry I didn't show
you guys the camera so there's the five
megapixel camera on the back there's the
flash and finally the back speaker so we
do have stereo speakers on the iconia
tab and let's see so normally I would
hold it like this if I'm using it in
landscape mode so let's see if those
speakers are covered they are not so
even though they are rear mounted
speakers the fact that you do have two
of them is going to help a lot in terms
of the audio quality compared to
something like the iPad 2 which has a
measly one back speaker that is you know
in the top right and is not that
comfortable to listen to so here if you
can come down and get down to about
table level here I just want to show you
guys the general form factor of the
iconia tab so it's not one of the
thinnest tab
on the market by any stretch but you
know what I'm gonna grab one other one
for you guys so that you can just see as
a basis of comparison here this is the
Toshiba Thrive so this is the thickest
of the Android tablets that I've had a
look at so far so you can see it falls
right into that middle ground so so
there's the iPad there's the iPad 2 as
well just so you guys can compare
so the Iconia Tab we're left with here
and I think that's pretty much
everything I wanted to say about it
