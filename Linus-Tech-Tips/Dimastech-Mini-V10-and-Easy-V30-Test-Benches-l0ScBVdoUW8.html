about the practice of teasing upcoming
content and frequently resorting to
potty humor in the intros of my videos I
wanted to address both of these issues
once and for all if an official
statement but instead opted to remind
you guys to make sure you're subscribed
so you don't miss our upcoming tour of
the Sennheiser Factory which is coming
very soon and to introduce the topic of
today's video with an analogy open air
test benches versus traditional cases
are kind of like boxers versus briefs
the pros and cons of the look is open
for debate but we can't deny that while
boxers provide more airflow and allow
for easier access to key components they
just don't wrap things up in a tight
little package the same way briefs do
and the same goes for test benches
versus cases thanks guys you've been a
terrific audience
the Coolermaster Neptune 240m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more normally on a case I would look at
the inside and the outside but the
dimmest tech mini v1 and ez v3 are open
test benches so there is no outside
really so we're going to do more of like
a set-up guide thing today then focusing
on the mini v1 start by taking off the
aluminum fund screws on the sides and
sliding out the bottom tray screw the
rubber feet into the bottom with your
hands next assemble the vandal switches
for the front by using the included
wiring diagram this was a little jig
here the night of Hope because the clips
aren't really the right size for the
nubbins on the back of the switches but
it will work as long as you don't
accidentally pull them off take off the
fastening nuts put them through the
holes in the front then tighten the nuts
from the back if you want more complete
front i/o the mini v1 has one empty spot
for a USB 3 port and the EZ v3 has room
for a more complete set but neither of
them includes this accessory by default
the next step involves one of the
coolest pieces of case hardware I've
seen in a while the mini v1 includes
these nice
all metal standoffs that lock the board
in place with so much strength that you
can actually pick up the entire test
bench by the motherboard if you really
wanted to but it still allows it to be
swapped to lessly it should be noted
that my ez v3 came with more traditional
screw mounted standoffs for some reason
though it's jank time again for this
next at the instructions simply say use
the special m4 screws in m4 nut to
attach the PCI support bracket and I was
like ok special whatever that means
turns out they meant this one then I
went to install it and while dmoz tech
could have simply put holes for this
instead they went with slits for some
reason you know just in case your
motherboard has its PCI slots in an
unusual location or something it's not a
huge deal but it meant that I had to
actually put a graphics card on to the
bench for a test fit in order to align
it correctly next up is the Flex fan and
this has to be the most be a snake-armed
thing I've ever seen on a computer
component anyway the arm screws into
either of the two threaded holes that
are positioned for easy supplementary
airflow over a multi-way graphics card
setup or the CPU area it's strong enough
to hold a single 120 millimeter water
cooling radiator and fan which is
fortunate because while the ezv 3
features triple 120 or dual 140 radiator
mounts on both sides those are only
suitable for a custom loop so that means
that neither of these test benches
actually has any other position where a
prefilled one dual 120 radiator could be
installed back to the way most people
will be using the Flex arm though
especially if they're using a CPU
heatsink for a fan I still think the arm
itself is great but the bracket could
use a little work as it is it requires a
custom screw and nut when with a wider
hole it could have just used standard
fan screws and I think a larger bracket
one with eight screw holes for for 140
mill and four for 120 mill wouldn't have
cost much more and would have given a
lot more flexibility to how it can be
used drive installation is taken care of
by removing the appropriate drive cage
so just undo the thumb screws up the
front and slide it forward then by
screwing five and a quarter inch tube I
indirectly and by putting rubber
grommets in place for your three and a
half inch devices then screwing them in
with the non special screws for a nice
stable anti vibrational mount to mount
the power supply the manual simply says
use 632 screws something that won't be
challenging for very experienced
builders but may give pause to newcomers
to the computer assembly game and then
once those are in you're pretty close to
done I initially didn't really like the
power supply mount because it looked
like it was just kind of going to end up
hanging there but once you put the
bottom tray back in and then screw that
in from the sides it rests on it and
yeah there's there's no flex left in the
back of it so no big deal there the
on-the-fly drive mount position on the
left side of the mini of you one is
super handy just put the appropriately
threaded thumb screws into a two and a
half inch or three and a half inch drive
with a rubber spacer in between stick it
in there and slide it into place I wish
there were more cable management options
it didn't involve running across the top
or the front of the bench especially
since the power and reset buttons are
right there but again not a huge deal
given it is an open-air bench which
leads us to the conclusion Dima stack
actually reached out to us not just to
do a review but to ask if we were
interested in switching from the high
speed PC tech stations that you guys
normally see in our videos to theirs
exclusively and while the mini v1 and
it's bigger brother the EZ v3 are solid
well-built test benches that we will use
it's not such a slam-dunk victory that
I'm ready to throw my tech stations in
the garbage let's start with where the
high-speed pcs come away with an
advantage number one is sheer speed for
a bench where motherboard swaps are a
daily occurrence
the nylon posts are faster for two
reasons one they are easier to slide on
once the board is in position and two
they are plastic so you can move around
faster without worrying about scratching
the underside of a board potentially
damaging it
number two is fan mount positioning if
you just want to fan the Flex fan system
is great for pointing it at wherever
your hot spots are but if you want an
all-in-one CPU cooler especially a dual
120 rad one the dmoz Tech's fall short
and number three is footprint even the
mini takes up more space
on a desk then the ex-lax high-speed PC
tech station which I guess leads us into
the dmoz tech advantages number one is
if you're using it as an actual case and
you're looking to pimp out your bench
they've got a ton of really great
accessories XL ATX adapters for the mini
drive mounting adapters a better power
supply support and even their red X
trousers let you attack more radiators
on to your system number two is they
look a lot better than the ones we
normally use in person and more
importantly for us on camera so if you
want your test Hardware to look more
presentable let's say you you know want
to take photos of it for a forum that
your member of or whatever else the ezd
3 and mini v1 come away clear winners
here number three is build quality some
of our tech stations feel like they're
going to come apart when you lift them
they've been in use for a couple of
years not going to happen ever with the
steel construction of these units and
then finally number four is assembly
time it only takes about 15 minutes even
struggling with the manual a little to
assemble one of these out of the box for
an experienced builder whereas the high
speed PC ones do take quite a while to
put together
so in summary there's room for
improvement better documentation in
particular would be great and I'd really
like to see a better system than a
little screw cap container for all the
mounting hardware maybe something that
clips onto the bench for easy storage
but all in all this is a quality product
and great as a presentable looking test
bench or open air case for custom water
coolers and air coolers speaking of
presentable looking you guys may have
noticed I've been wearing this shirt
lately and wondering where you can get
one well for the value price of just
1995 you can have your very own keep on
digging shirt just like this one here so
whether it's our bro hands at Ubisoft
telling us about the cinematic
experience of gaming at 30 FPS or really
any other company that just seems
determined to make everyone hate them
American ISPs anyone you'll be ready
with encouragement and a pixel art
shovel if we all work together maybe we
can create a network of tunnels through
the Earth's core with high speed heat
and pressure resistant trains that run
through them revolutionizing worldwide
travel forever
or not also guys that's why I think that
should like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment if you
feelings more complicated than this also
check the link in the video description
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
