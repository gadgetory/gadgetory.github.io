for the last year and it looks like we
still have months to go before they cool
down fortunately in the meantime you can
simply go to download more ram comm and
install as much as you need all without
spending it ok most of you probably saw
that coming
but researching how to increase your RAM
actually does bring up a lot of bullcrap
advice from guys like this who tell you
to clean your fans with baking flour and
then laugh at you when it blows up in
your face so today's video is all about
cutting through the nonsense with a
red-hot knife of real-world pro tips to
help you get the right memory upgrade
for less
Origin PC offers beautiful custom
desktops high-performance laptops and
life time 24/7 tech support they only
use high quality products like samsung's
960 pro m2 SSDs and you can visit Origin
PC today at the link below for a limited
time deal if you Google double your RAM
for free the most common solutions
you'll find are to open up windows
advanced performance options and
increase what's called virtual memory
now Ram is accessed in pages or chunks
of memory that are read and written as a
whole so the theory here is that because
many of these pages don't change for
long periods of time or even at all once
the operating system is finished loading
they can be moved off of your superfast
RAM and then on to your way way slower
virtual memory that's stored on your SSD
freeing your RAM up to kick ass and to
bubblegum ease the problem is that
you're not actually increasing your
system's physical memory you're just
allocating more of the storage so that
SSD or even a hard drive to act like
memory this is designed to prevent
programs from crashing due to low memory
errors but these devices are far too
slow to be an actual solution and your
computer should be set to manage these
settings automatically anyway we
recommend leaving them alone
another trick is memory compression
which takes those infrequently called
pages and spend some CPU resources on
shrinking them down like a zip file so
that they don't occupy as much RAM this
is actually how old software like RAM
doubler worked so the good news here is
that it's not BS and if you're using a
recent PC or Mac then your computer
already does it automatically and the
bad news is that other than running a
hypervisor like VMware's ESXi and then a
virtualized OS under it third-party apps
that do this are no longer available if
you're a Windows 7 holdout for example
the next common tip is to use a ram
clean
program these work by placing a heavy
demand on the RAM prompting the system
to push existing memory pages to virtual
memory and to discard inactive ones but
number one if you happen to relaunch a
program that was previously cached but
inactive you're gonna have to wait for
it to completely load again and to a lot
of the pages are just going to move back
to physical memory once you call on them
anyway you'd be better off to do some
good old-fashioned housekeeping take a
look at the programs that are set to
launch on startup on your system and
make sure that there are no memory
hungry apps that you barely ever use
choking your supply finally you might
come across suggestions that you
overclock your RAM look take it from me
this is generally not worth it yes you
can make the rent that you have
marginally faster but you're opening
yourself up to troubleshooting hell if
your memory isn't 100% stable and you're
not actually really fixing the
bottleneck which is the slow loading of
data from your main system storage into
the RAM leading us finally to the
surefire one tech tip to rule them all
solution for increasing your RAM I hate
to do this to you guys but remember last
time when the way to double your
internet speed this method really works
was to pay for faster internet bonded
internet is faster but it is not free
well the solution here is to just buy
more round Bo wait hold on
this video wasn't totally pointless we
can help you save a few bucks tip number
one is to buy used RAM if second hand
makes you nervous remember that many
memory manufacturers offer limited
lifetime warranties meaning that if you
buy on eBay and it doesn't work and for
whatever reason eBay and PayPal zone
protection mechanisms fail you you may
still be able to get it replaced for
free except for maybe the return
shipping cost and you're probably
thinking well hold on don't you have to
be the original purchaser
actually the answer is that depends not
every company includes that stipulation
in their warranty policy and even some
of the ones we do like Kingston and
Corsair confirmed when we reached out to
them that they often waive this
requirement along with the one for proof
of purchase in favor of providing better
customer service so as long as you're
dim it still has the genuine serial
number stickers on it there's a good
chance you could get it replaced and why
stop at desktop RAM small-outline or s o
dims from an old laptop can be
repurposed using inexpensive adapters
like the ones we used in this video one
word of caution though when you're
buying used is to look out for system
specific RAM this is RAM but if you look
up the part number you'll find is
guaranteed to work with one or usually a
small handful of specific systems it
usually costs more anyway because it's
got this extra stage of validation but
if you do find a good deal on it just
beware there's a chance of a work but
it's also possible that it won't be
stable or straight up won't work in a
system that it wasn't designed for as
for those of you who insist on buying
new it's trickier to come up with tips
for you we had kind of hoped that
historical data might reveal a time of
the year when ran is cheaper or some
kind of consistent pattern in how the
launch of a new technology like the
upcoming ddr5 might affect the price of
the existing technology but the launch
of ddr4 did not spur a mass liquidation
of ddr3 stock because the chipsets and
CPUs that accompany ddr4 didn't bring
enough of a performance jump to compel
the average mainstream user to upgrade
to the new platform so if you were
itching for a memory upgrade at the end
of 2014 you may actually have been
better off to just go for it rather than
wait around for prices to fall and this
is something that may happen again with
ddr 5 which is slated for release
sometime in the next couple of years so
the unfortunate reality is that there
are
many forces at play that influence the
price of commodity desktop memory
modules including surging demand for
low-power DRAM for smartphones depressed
yields due to manufacturers recently
switching their process notes to use
smaller lithography or even just plain
old bad luck so ultimately you're left
with two options playing the market
monitoring DRAM exchange and snapping up
bushels of sticks the moment the price
dips then flipping them when it goes up
or just bucking up and buying the RAM
you need when you need it
