of tech deals from the teaser that we
think are going to be pretty sick and we
created a forum thread where we're
curating the best deals posted by
members of our community no no there's
no time for that door Crashers are
selling out as we speak
the only CPU on the deal spreadsheet
they provided the AMD FX 8350 it's not
that fast it consumes a lot of power and
it's super old but it comes with a
raised cooler and even if you buy an
additional MSI motherboard it's about
the same price as a risin 5 1600 by
itself Corsairs mm 100 mouse mat is on
sale I have no idea what the price will
be
but it's a good mouse pad and it's only
$10 regularly so the deal can't really
be bad next up we've got a couple gaming
systems no pricing for these yet either
but the ACS g20 is a really nice quiet
compact gaming desktop with a gtx 1070
and the discount should allow you to
grab an SSD to upgrade this hard drive
only model side note if you're
disappointed with the lack of memory and
SSD deals this year that's due to
worldwide DRAM and NAND flash shortages
the more you know and as for notebooks
we've got the Acer predator Helios 300 a
gaming laptop we reviewed recently with
a GTX 1060 that's already an utterly
killer deal at its regular price of
$1100 it only gets better from there if
you can't find our video review it's
because it's an early access right now
but TLDR this thing is really awesome
Dual Shock controllers are on sale if
you're cool you can buy this silver one
and if you're tasteless you can get this
one I think we all know which one I'd
recommend Nvidia shield TV console is a
pretty versatile little piece of
streaming hardware it's got an
attractive IP voice control powerful
hardware for android games support for
Nvidia game stream so you can run your
PC games over the network and support
for 4k Netflix all of this at 20% off
and of course you've got the usual
discounts on Amazon's own products
eighty dollars off for the echo smart
speaker that still doesn't work in
Canada because Canada and $50 off the
top Bluetooth speaker with Alexa so if
you wanted one of these but didn't want
to pay as much for it then you win and
while we're at it the Fire HD 8 tablet
is 30 bucks off making it only 50
dollars for a tablet that just destroys
but keep this tablet that we covered
recently that honestly didn't cost much
less so yeah aside from a bulk pack of
triple-a batteries that's pretty much
what we found but you can check out the
forum link below and see what our
community members thought was hot
or better yet contribute your finds
there and we'll collect them in the top
post and credit your username happy
prime day everybody it's going to be the
only holiday left when Amazon formally
takes over the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
