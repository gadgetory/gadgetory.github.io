the Intel booth we are going to check
out the top three laptops and we have
some special ones here also thank you to
Intel who brought us here to practically
2017
Chhotu unlocks newegg.com for some
special deals on processors while
supplies last first off we're going to
check out the biggest the heaviest most
ridiculous laptop even though it
probably shouldn't be allowed to be
called that that I have personally ever
seen it has a curved 2560 by 1080 screen
it is IPS as 120 Hertz display and it's
just not below that display it has a
full teary MX brown mechanical keyboard
the same that you would have on a
desktop and on the right hand side
there's a touchpad where you can flip it
over and get a number pad as well inside
it has an Intel Core i7 7820 hk2 GTX
1080s in sli 64 gigs of ram a one
terabyte raid 0 of nvme drives and a one
terabyte hard drive this is why it needs
it's five bands and nine internal heat
pipes the cooling on this thing is
insane and it follows that up with giant
exhaust ports in the back between those
exhaust ports in the back you have to
power ins for two different power bricks
that are both 330 Watts Thunderbolt 3
Gigabit Ethernet 2 DisplayPort 1.2 ports
and HDMI 2.0 on the right-hand side you
have dual USB 3.0 s and a Kensington
lock and then on the left hand side you
have another dual USB 3.0 a headphone
and microphone jacks and an SD card
reader and all of that will cost you
only a meagre nine thousand dollars
which is over four times the price of my
first car which is just absolutely
ridiculous they don't have any different
spec levels for this laptops you can't
get less RAM or lower storage to make it
cheaper but as Linus has said in the
past I wouldn't even expect them to if
you're going to spend $9,000 on a laptop
I wouldn't expect you to be super
worried about going down to eight and a
half thousand in order to save a few
bucks on a few extra specs this thing is
ridiculous no one expects to buy it so
the next laptop is going to be a little
bit more reasonable
next up we have a Norris x7 version 7
this one is still a blazing fast laptop
with an Intel Core i7 78 20 HK 16 gigs
of ram that can go up to 64 if you want
to do some upgrading and an NVIDIA GTX
1078 gig with g-sync it has two 256
gigabyte nvme drives one one terabyte
hard drive and a 1440p screen running at
120 Hertz with a 5 millisecond delay
below that you have a fully RGB keyboard
with 5 macro keys on the left hand side
and you have 2 2 watt speakers and 2 2
watt subwoofers also in the unit on the
left hand side you have a headphone and
microphone jack USB 3.0 type-a and a
full size Ethernet port on the back
you've USB 3.0 power in and a light-up
logo on the back of the screen and then
on the right hand side you have an SD
card reader a USB 3.0 port a USB 3.1
type C port HDMI 2.0 and a mini
DisplayPort the fans in this unit pull
air in from the top and then exhaust air
out the back and out the sides of the
unit so that they don't eat your hands
up which is actually pretty cool and
then to cap it off you have a ninety
four point two four watt hour battery
which to be able to keep you going for a
fairly reasonable time I think this
laptop makes a little bit more sense
it's really high performance but it's a
little bit more reasonable in the weight
department and a little bit more
reasonable in the price department
although it is still very much a premium
gaming laptop and last but not least we
have the msi GS for t---three be our
phantom pro this is toted as the
lightest VR ready laptop and we already
actually make sense here when they call
like SSDs VR ready and stuff it carries
no weight but a laptop B already cool
I'm down with that
it weighs 1.8 kilograms which is
slightly less than 4 pounds and it is
only 21 point 8 millimeters thick which
is a fair amount less than one inch
thick on the inside you have an Intel
Core i7 7700 HQ which boosts up to 3.8
gigahertz and a TTX 1066 gigabytes this
version has 16 gigabytes of RAM but can
expand up to 32 gigabytes if you want to
do that on your own and
128 gigabyte nvme drive along with a one
pair white hard drive we got a 1080p
webcam - 2 watt speakers and a 61 @ watt
hour battery which is pretty alright
especially for house inin light this
laptop is on the left hand side you have
a Kensington lock slot full-sized
Ethernet an SD card slot 3 USB 3.0 ports
on a headphone and microphone jack on
the right hand side you have USB 3.0
Thunderbolt HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort
and power in so we had the full range we
have the juggernaut really heavy really
powerful really ridiculous really
expensive then we have the one in the
middle really fast very high refresh
rate screen but a reasonable weight and
a slightly more reasonable price then we
went down a little bit more it's thinner
it's really light doesn't weigh very
much but still high enough performance
to doovy are really easy to tote around
hopefully you liked our top three at the
Intel booth at PAX East 2017 again be
