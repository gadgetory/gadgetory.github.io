brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful so we're here in the ibuypower
suite and for the second time in only
three years they are launching something
truly revolting here at the show so if
you're not familiar with them I buy
power is a boutique system builder they
make all kinds of custom rigs and this
is the revolt - I didn't actually mean
it was disgusting I meant it we had
revolt in the name what did you think I
was talking about three years ago they
launched the revolt it had that you know
riser card and it was super tiny it had
the GPU shown on the it's through the
window in the case there this is that
this is a totally different thing so
they've changed pretty much everything
about it
except for that concept of it being a
very compact machine and one that puts
the GPU at the forefront of the
industrial design so the first thing you
notice looking at it is that GPU it's
illuminated by RGB lighting so you can
go I want solid colors I want breathing
colors I want a freakin rainbow over my
graphics card and regardless of whether
you want to go all the way up to
something like a gtx 980ti or a tight
necks if you're into spending too much
for no additional performance you can
put it in here and they've got the
thermals all figured out although we'll
go over that in more detail once we
actually open it up inside the other
thing I wanted to show at the front is
they've got two two and a half inch
mounts for SSDs or even hard drives I
guess if you were really into that sort
of thing as well as front USB three
front audio and a front power button
that I'm gonna try not to accidentally
press again on the side panels you won't
find a whole lot of much of anything
unless you're cool like me and in
addition to the little ventilation holes
and stuff yeah you showed up for
ibuypower to reveal that they had
actually done up a custom side panel for
you with the Linus tech tips and when
logos overlaid pretty cool stuff they've
actually got a number of neat ones on
display here in the suite just to kind
of show off what can be done and then
around the back you'll find well
ventilation holes and different i/o
depending on what kind of a
configuration you choose because that's
what I buy power is they are a custom
system builder and build a system in it
they did so now that we've got the side
panel off we get a pretty good look at
how this whole thing works inside it's
funny because from the top the only
thing you really see is the graphics
from the side the first thing that
really grabs your attention is the power
supply so they've inverted the ITX
standard motherboard that they're using
inside this case they have done away
with the PCI Express extension and they
are plugging the graphics card directly
into the motherboard what that means is
that pretty much the only place to put
the power supply is actually smack in
the middle of the chassis overtop of the
CPU area where the fan should actually
help draw a heated air away from the vrm
on the CPU because the CPU itself is a
non concern in this case because they've
made enough room down in the bottom of
the chassis for up to a dual 120
millimeter radiator or even a single 120
with a single 140 if you're going to
having both your cpu and your GPU
connected to an a i/o cooling loop now
it looks really cramped for this power
supply and you might think oh well what
if I want to expand in the future
personally I don't think it's a concern
they've got a thousand watt power supply
in here and realistically for a single
graphics card system you are unlikely to
ever need more than that but of course
those are always famous last words on
today I really don't think it is in this
case in the front we find a single
three-and-a-half inch hard drive cage if
you want something to go along with
those sexy SSDs and quite frankly I
don't think there's a whole lot left to
say about it that can't be said without
completely disassembling it and having a
look at how they're handling cable
management say for example but the good
news is that you may actually have an
opportunity to see me do that because I
by power will be working with us on
something we've never done before an
actual a deconstruction video rather
than like like a build guide it's gonna
be like a disassembly guide anyway leave
a comment letting me know what you want
to see me do when I put the revolt 2
through the paces a little while from
now so thanks for checking out our
