product I've been meaning to have a look
at for quite a while this is the MSI 770
G 45 so it's part of their G series or
their gaming series you can see they've
got a big red G here that's what that
means and it has a couple of features
that are pretty good first of all it has
full support for nmds centum 2x4 and it
also has full compatibility with Windows
7 it has their green eup technology
included you know I'm actually gonna
have a quick sort of zoom in here so
that you can actually see what I'm
talking about here now this board also
like most of the 700 series chipset
boards from MSI has support for the
brand new phantom 2 X 6s although that's
not marked on the box you just need to
make sure you update the BIOS with your
board before you will get support for
that so down here you can see it's a m3
CPU ready which we've already been
through comes with some kind of Norton
software supports lossless 24-bit audio
it has their easy OC switch which while
it's not quite as nice as their OC Genie
it's still a pretty useful little thing
it's got active phase switching which
gives you power savings so that means
that while this motherboard has a
certain number of phases to provide to
the power under peak load it can
actually reduce how many power phases
it's using at idle to make sure that
you're using less power at idle because
fewer power phases means less wasted
power also it features emphasize
unlocked CPU core technology stable on
lock so like so many AMD boards these
days there is support for unlocking the
extra cores in Indy's x2 and x3 CPUs
that are artificially reduced for sale
so here on the back we've got mostly the
same stuff the active phase but all
solid capacitors so that's a big one
that they've actually got on the back
here and I'm gonna just sort of zoom in
again here and it also has support for
EM flash this is a feature that was
missing from MSI boards for a long time
and now we're finding it almost across
the board allows you to flash the BIOS
without a floppy drive or or using you
know bootable USB drives or anything
that you just throw USB Drive on the
back of the motherboard
and then you boot up to the m / utility
and you can flash the BIOS just like
that inside the motherboard box we will
find a variety of things as per the
usual arrangement so let's see what we
have first of all you have the i/o
shield ok color coded for your
convenience next we have the drivers and
utilities DVD do not use that download
the latest off be in the side website
then we have a quick installation guide
and there doesn't appear to be anything
particularly quick about it it's quite
large it's not too bad actually here let
me just unzoom a little bit see if you
see how big this guy is I'm gonna turn
off my mother or my monitor so you don't
have to contend with that at the back
focusing so I show you how to install
the CPU RAM drives graphics card around
to the other side front panel headers
the power setting up the BIOS install
the vos and installing the drivers and
utilities very nice kinda walks you
through the whole process I mean really
building a computer is not that hard
these days the manufacturers cats and
the garbage bin make it so easy for us
ok here we have the user guide this is
the Europe version that's interesting
check that out Europe version really
nice there in the garbage again sorry
bear with me here get over there ok
garbage can has been relocated right
there ok so inside the user's guide we
will find many different languages so
the actual English portion is only about
well it's not that thick only about this
much English English English and then it
goes on just like that ok so next we've
got one IDE cable one SATA cable and
then one molex to SATA adapter that is a
fairly bare accessory package as far as
cables go but if you're anything like me
you've probably got about 50 SATA cables
lying around anyway
just get this motherboard opened up here
alright so layout layout is a pretty
standard sort of fare you've got all of
your so far I noticed that the power
adapt are the power connectors are in
their ideal locations so your 4 pin
power is up at the top left of the board
exactly where it belongs
and then you've got your am-3 socket so
I'm just gonna pull this sticker up so
you can have a better look at the am-3
socket along with the m3 socket you will
also get support for dual channel ddr3
just like all of the CPUs that run on
the am-3 socket will require then along
to the side of the board we've got our
24-pin connector exactly where it
belongs we've got a fairly beefy looking
heatsink on the north bridge chipset
okay then
moving down we have an IDE pork ok so
that's a side mounted one for easy
access and then we have kind of a
strange arrangement of the SATA port so
here we've got four right angles SATA
ports and then to normal we've got
facing right out of the board SATA ports
so that's a kind of a strange strange
decision but I think I see why they made
it because these two are rather these
four connectors could potentially be
interfered with by a full-length
graphics card whereas this one is not
nearly as bad down here we've got we've
got three USB headers and then we've got
our front panel connectors over here we
can see the overall layout of the board
is quite desirable so we have one PCI
Express 1x connector up at the top then
we have two PCI Express 16x and three
PCI so if you actually install two dual
with PCI Express video cards you'll be
left with one PCIe 1x and then 2 or
rather one PCI slot so that's pretty
much your optimal configuration of there
and then we've got the EZ OC switch so
it actually comes with instructions
written right on the board which is
pretty nice so here I'm just gonna zoom
in even
or there and try and position this so
you can see what I'm talking about so
the easy OC switch has instructions
right here so it says mm-hmm default is
on one and two and then 10% is one up
two down 15% is one down two up and then
20% over clock is flipping both of these
switches down now let's have a look at
the i/o connectivity on the back so
we've got two ps2 ports and this is an
odd one we've got a serial port so I
guess this motherboard could potentially
be used for industrial applications has
so many peripherals that are used in
sort of industries that aren't quite as
up to speed as the technology industry
so something like you know mining or
many many different industrial
applications will still need a serial
port we have six USB 2.0 ports no USB
3.0 support on this board it's a
relatively value minded board then we
have a Gigabit Ethernet port and 7.1
audio support so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the msi 770 g 45</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
