means to be a rugged man it ain't just
about drinking scalding hot coffee in
the morning and wearing nothing but your
chest hair with pride no being a rugged
man is about respect respect for the
truck he drives the animals he kills and
the place he does his daily work be it
on the jobsite or behind a desk in his
office and so it was with determination
in my mind that I went about setting
ripe shocking brahms I saw before me
I began by secure in all cords running
along the floor with strips of gaff tape
a rugged man don't got no fear of
falling but losing a hard day's work on
account of a sudden lost power
that ain't manly just stupid now I've
got a stand-in desk on a counter sitting
all days leaden cause a chink sleep itis
so I grabbed one of my trusty power
strips selecting one with a four-foot
cord to account for enough slack to
raise my desk to a stand and hide at
frequent intervals throughout the day
and screwed that sucker into the bottom
of my desk a task that made my hunger
rise inside with the force of a mighty
lion I vowed to continue my work but
only after I had consumed the necessary
sustenance for both my body and a soul
next would be the most difficult task of
my journey yet power chords
I tried scowling at the chord
for my pc monitor USB charger laptop a
desk and when nothing happened I scowled
again even harder when even that didn't
work I resorted to using j-joe double
sided velcro tape zip tie anchors and
cable ox to prevent these copper demons
whomever regaining their freedom but it
was then that I realized the wires for
my peripheral devices network cables
they were small but they were many I
sprang into action before I could be
overwhelmed securing them with adhesive
back cable drops and carefully forming
them into straight lines wherever
possible and it was in that way that the
army of live-in USBs snake-like as they
were were contained but my two snakes
boa and Python and also this little
gizmo I guess thanks for watching this
