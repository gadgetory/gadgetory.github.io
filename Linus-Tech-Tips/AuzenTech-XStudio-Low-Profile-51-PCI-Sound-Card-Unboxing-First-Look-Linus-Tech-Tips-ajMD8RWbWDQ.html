generate a fair amount of interest so
today I'm going to be having a look at
the X Studio 5.1 from awesome tech I can
come right out and tell you any awesome
tech soundcard is probably a good choice
you just find the one in your price
range and buy it and it's probably
either thee or close to the best card to
buy in that price range so there's a
little summary on the side here of the
connectivity so you can see this is
either a low profile or a full-height
card it supports a bunch of different
outputs which we'll have a closer look
at when we've actually got the card out
of the box this is the X studio 5.1
which I believe I already set up we just
like go ahead and open up the package
and start having a look at this thing we
can talk about the specs on the box
while we're doing that okay as long as I
can get the wraparound done then we'll
be in good shape
another thing that awesome tech is a
pretty unique instead they allow you
another way that they're unique is that
they allow you to swap the op-amp so
those are the actual chips built into
the sound card that do the amplification
so you can swap in anything you want
whereas on a lot of other brands of
sound cards you would actually have to
desolder the original ones and solder on
new ones they make it a lot easier for
you and that basically allows you to buy
different op amps and tune it to
whatever however you want the card to
sound now this one only has a socket for
the front for the two stereo channels so
for your your front left and front right
channels although they're higher in
charge actually have swappable sockets
or even many of the other channels as
well so here's this actually here we're
not going to look at the sound card
quite yet let's have a look at what's
included in terms of accessories and
cables and other stuff alright well
we've got our low profile bracket which
is all fancy and gold-plated and looks
very nice has a little oz and logo
stamped into it then we have a little
adapter okay so we'll show you how that
works in just a moment and then we have
an empty plastic bag oh I guess that's
what this was inside so that it would
stay protected but it fell out in
shipping
that's too bad there now we've reboxed
that particular aspect of this card then
we have an easy set-up guide which is in
a variety of different languages and
tells you how to easily set up the part
all right
setting up sound card is fairly
straightforward you plug it in you
install the driver here's the
installation CD download the latest
drivers off the Logitech website for
best results alright so we'll have a
look at the card itself now the fairly
inexpensive card actually I believe this
is one of the least expensive if not the
least expensive that awesome tech has
ever released so it's a great
opportunity for someone who's never
tried an awesome tech sound card to find
out what all the fuss is about so you
can see from this plug here we can are
from the back of the card here we can
plug in optical audio out we have a
shoot I believe that's a line in
probably would be my guess we have a
microphone and then we have our 7.1
audio out here so this is a headphones
is here this one is Center this one is
front and this one is side did I say 7.0
rear I did I say 7.1 I meant 5.1 this is
a 5.1 card so here is the swappable
op-amp here so that is the amplification
chip for the front connector so that's
that one so you can put in something
else if you want it is socketed so you
can remove it quite easily alright let's
talk a little bit more about the
features that are included with this
board so it has support for HD front
panel audio that's something that was
missing on a lot of sound cards until
Asin tech came on the scene because
certain sound card manufacturers wanted
you to buy proprietary front panel
connectors but this will hook up to the
front panel of any case which is great
for a value solution like this next
we've got internal digital output via a
two pin connector okay so that's right
there and what else do we have on here
they've got a 3d surround engine dragger
support so that's cue sound I've
actually never heard of q7 before but if
anyone has this card feel free to post
under the comments of the video and let
us know what you think of the Hughson
3d engine and that pretty much covers
everything I wanted to say about it well
apparently the mic has has a preamp gain
of +6 decibels which is great because I
don't know about you but I've used a lot
of mics and a lot of sound cards and I
find that 90% of the time it's just not
loud enough and so they've added a
little bit of a boost to it which is uh
which is really nice if you boost it
properly you don't get that Distortion
and the last thing we got is oh yeah the
audio processor being used is a via 1723
audio processor and you can see that
right there so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the X
Studio 5.1 I know there's not a whole
lot to talk about with a sound card but
the point of this video is basically in
this price range if this is sort of if
you've never had a dedicated sound card
before you don't know what you're
missing because onboard audio despite
what whoever will tell you about it is
just not as good as a dedicated card
even with a value solution like this
you're going to get a much more
satisfying experience versus onboard so
I definitely recommend picking up an
awesome tech sound card if you haven't
already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
