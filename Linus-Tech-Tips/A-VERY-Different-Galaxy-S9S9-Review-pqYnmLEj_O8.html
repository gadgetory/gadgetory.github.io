Samsung Galaxy S 9 I wake up
32 time oh my always-on OLED display and
hit the snooze button just like I did
with my s8 night breakfast and read the
news silently appreciating the tall 18
and a half by 9 aspect ratio will select
Bible with my F sight I grab my keys and
jacket and that's Bigsby what my
schedule for the day oh no no I'm just
kidding about that last one but but but
seriously as someone who legitimately
loves the Galaxy s8 what exactly do the
s9 and the s9 + apparent carbon copies
of the last gen really change and does
any of it matter let's find out after I
tell you today's video is brought to you
by ZOTAC ZOTAC smek one gaming pc is an
ultra slim desktop PC featuring a sleek
robotic style design check it out at the
link below to learn more
okay so here are the improvements to the
s9 family on paper you get a faster
octa-core processor of the snapdragon or
Exynos variety depending on your region
some more memory but only on the plus a
brighter screen a bump to maximum
cellular data rates and a camera with
two yes two aperture sizes and then all
of this other stuff is basically the
same with some of it like thickness
appearing to get worse so this means by
my calculations here the days of big
generational improvements to cell phones
these are officially over however unlike
a lot of the tech press I am NOT going
to crucify Samsung over this the s8 and
the s8 plus are a year old now and still
competitive with much newer devices like
the 5 T from no longer that budget brand
oneplus even if the pixel 2 in the
iPhone 10 have edged them out in DX Omar
and besides
while the improvements are small a lot
of them are pretty meaningful so in
order of importance to me personally one
the audio setup is great and I'm sure
there are discerning audio files out
there who take exception to Samsung's
choice of DAC but as far as I'm
concerned the retention of the headphone
jack at all and the inclusion of an
amplified earphone speaker that gives me
stereo sound on the better than ever
OLED super wide display make the s9 and
especially the plus variant the ideal
movie-watching phones period second and
this is a close second is the camera
even if in practical terms the
difference between F 1.5 and F 2 point
for physical apertures is less than it
sounds like with how wide the main
shooters lens is you're not gonna
suddenly see like a huge difference in
true bokeh pass
you know six inches away like you would
on a real DSLR you're still relying on
software selective focus on the s9 +
dual capture with processing on the s9
Plus which is better than this one but
it still has issues with that said it is
still more than a full stop
meaning that at one point five a lot
more light hits the sensor physically
while at two point four the image should
be sharper letting Samsung in theory
have their cake and eat it too now
subjectively the pixel - excels color
processing looks more true-to-life to me
here here here here and well in most
situations but this is a characteristic
of the Samsung camera experience that
I've mostly come to accept especially if
I get something worthwhile back in
exchange and I do this challenging high
contrast shot in direct sunlight reveals
that one modern phone cameras are
getting really good across the board and
to that when we do pixel peep the s9
whether you love or hate they're more
aggressive sharpening filter captures
more detail and in this shot of my cat
sleeping next to me in bed the iPhone 10
holds up reasonably well but the pixel -
gets curb-stomped I mean for some of you
this is probably a meaningless edge case
but I'm not a wannabe photographer I
just like capturing cute pictures when
I'm spending time with my kids and
because I live in rain Coover six months
out of the year that takes place inside
my house a perpetually dim environment
thanks to my dark floors so it makes a
really big difference to me
moving on to the fingerprint sensor
location this never really bothered me
on the s8 however on the s8 plus and on
the node eight next to the camera up
there is basically unusable with my
small hands so the s9 plus is an
enormous improvement then the last big
one for me is the structural changes
that Samsung
has made under the hood the new phones
are made of more durable aluminum with
thicker glass giving them spectacular
rigidity other than a D brand skin I
prefer no protection and so it's
comforting to know that my chances of
surviving a drop are better but some
trade-offs were made here the increase
in weight won't be noticeable to any but
the daintiest users but in spite of a
thickness jump the battery capacity of
both models is unchanged from last year
now Samsung has been quoted as saying
that their eight-point battery check
will give the s9 family 95% of their day
one battery life after two years and if
that holds true then that's swell or not
as it were but as a heavy user the s8
had middling battery life from the
get-go
once all my stuff was installed so I'm
on the pixel to excel my Galaxy s8
something I have installed on it is
making the battery drain really fast I
haven't had the time to deal with it
as much as I love the form factor I just
couldn't keep using it so my new daily
driver it's gonna have to be the s9 plus
then and that's about it pretty much
every other complaint that I have about
this phone is either in software or has
a simple solution like the Bigsby button
nothing personal against Bixby she can
actually do some really cool stuff that
it baffles me that Google assistant and
Siri can't do you can actually do much
more advanced things like this go to the
homescreen
boom but the placement of this button
directly opposite the lock button was
and still is an ergonomic disaster
however Samsung supports disabling it
outright and you can use third-party
software to remap it now intelligent
scan where the phone chooses iris or
facial recognition depending on the
scenario isn't as consistent as face ID
but it doesn't have to be because they
didn't pull off the fingerprint reader
you can just you
whatever you want which honestly for me
is like okay look here did you know that
the ass nine has nine yes nine different
ways to take a selfie now most of them
are weird gimmicks that I never used and
neither will you but I guess that's the
Samsung experience in a nutshell packed
full of features some of which are
seemingly random like you guys remember
that thing they were doing where the
screen would scroll with your eyes and
then this year's half-baked inclusion is
a crude ripoff of an emojis but but with
lots of things that are great panorama
selfies so that I can fit all of my
friends in the frame awesome faster
fingerprint registration with a swipe
well it doesn't come up very often but
heck yeah landscape boat on the
homescreen like a tablet why did that
take so long
launching two apps in split-screen from
a single button sure why not
well okay actually I can think of one
reason why not so that you could have
your software team spending more time
maintaining the latest software on your
existing devices instead of creating
fluff that no one asked for the s7 is
still in the testing phase for Android
8.0 Oreo just one year ago that was
Samsung's flagship phone think about
that
so the s9 looks solid especially at the
unlocked price and the s9 plus gets a
straight-up recommendation to buy I
would take it over the more expensive no
date for sure but with the caveat that
until Samsung makes a real commitment to
support at the very least its flagship
devices the way that Apple does I can
only unequivocally recommend them to
people who upgrade every couple of years
and they're never going to truly stand
out from other Android manufacturers
until they address this which given the
way that they're catching up in key
areas like camera image quality means
that time
you guys got to be paying attention
because the window is closing on finding
a new way to differentiate speaking of
differentiating want to differentiate
your phone with an awesome D brand skin
D brand is your source for awesome vinyl
skins available for laptops phones
tablets consoles controllers and more
they use high quality authentic true
textured 3m vinyl on every product they
feature unrivaled precision measure many
times cut wants philosophy means that
the factory fit for your product will be
perfect and not only do D brand skins
look great they protect against damage
and scratches to their customer service
robots are easy to work with and they're
fantastic product selector lets you see
exactly what your product will look like
before you order they're affordable they
ship worldwide and you can check them
out at the link below so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked do
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button let us know in the comments what
you think of this slightly different
format or if you even noticed check out
the link to where to buy the stuff we
featured in the video description also
linked down there's our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one and
our community forum which you should
totally join kind of messed up my outro
there that's okay I don't think anybody
cares does anyone still watching at this
point ok ok
we still have a receipt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
