OEM CPU was my most ridiculous possible
CPU unboxing you were wrong I just found
this gem okay so this is the this will
be a retro unboxing I suppose because
it's no longer best-in-class performance
for everyday computing this is the AMD
sempron and this box dates back to when
the sempron was running on socket 754
check that out okay so here we go
award-winning AMD technology AMD
qualified heatsink and fan comes with a
three year limited warranty which I
guarantee is up by now alright so then
we go around to this side which also
talks about the best-in-class
performance this is okay pretty oh here
we go so here this box contains AMD
sempron processor heat sink fan bezel
sticker installation guide and
certificate of authenticity and three
year limited warranty information to
avoid damage the processors will only be
used with a recommended AMD sempron
processor compatible motherboard and
power supplies so this must include a
really big e tank a really big sticker
or a really thick installation guide one
of the three and this is an iPhone 4
scale okay camera man's iPhone so this
is quite quite a large box as you can
probably guess so let's get this opened
up here and find out what is inside and
it's Ruby so inside the Sempron box we
found an AMD ATI agent Ruby special ops
well I thought he was going in for a
shot of rubies cleavage there but it
turns out that he was going in for a
shot of the yeah yeah well there there
it is
so rubies kind of manage looking as you
can see but I mean the cleavage is still
there so it all kind of counts I suppose
either way yes I planted this there this
is not what actually came in the box I
just thought this was funny and that I
would share it with my subscribers thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
AMD sempron novelty jumbo box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
