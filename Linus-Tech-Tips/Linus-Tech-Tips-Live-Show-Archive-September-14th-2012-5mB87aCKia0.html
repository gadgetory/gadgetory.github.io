everybody welcome to the live show that
that I promised I really hope the mic is
is working ok because it's been really
irritating me so we've run through some
some of the different problems that
we've had I'm quiet ok I can fix quiet
actually believe it or not I can I can
do that ok so I'm gonna I'm gonna turn
it up I'm turning it up now in fact here
I'll even show you guys how I'm turning
it up so I'm gonna turn it up right in
here see so I tried this this steel
series USB sound card that was seem to
be fixing some of the issues and then it
didn't fix other issues and I'm gonna
turn it up just a little bit cuz some of
you were saying you don't want it up
that high so there we go good evening
everybody and we've got a fantastic show
for you actually we don't really have a
show at all we just have me sort of
sitting here and hopefully taking some
questions although I do want to start
with something that is on everybody's
mind so
iPhone 5 what do you guys think of this
go ahead you can use a twitch chat you
can use Twitter so we're gonna go ahead
and add another actually no we're not
we're not gonna we're not gonna we're
not gonna add anything right now so I
wanna I wanna know what you guys think
I'm gonna let you know what I think so
what what I think is that basically I
don't understand any reason why anyone
who owns an Apple phone is upgrading
from a 4 or 4s to this phone because it
looks like what we're what we're dealing
with is a phone that is basically a
little bit see this to me is a lot like
the iPad 1 to iPad 2 upgrade because
what we're getting is a slightly thinner
device with slightly less weight and
we're getting basically a slightly
longer screen although although that's
actually one of the things I like so
compared to what I've seen from most
people who are saying that they think
it's phenomenally stupid that Apple has
just enlarged the screen I have small
ham so I would like to explain from an
ergonomics perspective why they've done
that I can already barely reach say I'm
gonna show you guys this I can barely
reach to the edge of my iPhone screen
had they made it a little bit wider I
wouldn't be able to reach it all
especially something in the top-left
corner I can barely make it up there so
that's why I think they've gone ahead
and and done it that way so yeah okay
guys like you guys are giving me a hard
time you're like yeah it has a better
screen it has a better camera I
understand all of that and that's all
fine and good but it's very small
incremental changes I mean I've got a
friend one of my one of my dad mminton
buddies is just like I I asked him about
this when the 4s was released I was like
okay you got iPhone 4 are you what do
you think are you planning to upgrade to
the 4s he's like yeah I'm like okay oh
why and he's like oh because I just I
have the latest one and that's that's
like the kind of guy I am
and I'm like oh okay so so so you're the
kind of guy who just like just like buys
it because because just whatever and if
you followed me on Twitter
ozzie 8:32 you would already know that I
play badminton so you should be
following me on Twitter at - Tech so
there you go BAM I'm gonna also I'm
gonna try and read some of these
comments here for a little bit guys rly
Q full your important question about
water cooling in a 3930k in a particular
sort of configuration I can't take any
questions about exact configurations on
these live streams because I have to
focus on the things that and every one
stands a chance of finding relevant
alright here we go - your upgrade cycle
is good yeah - your upgrade cycle is
okay but I don't I don't really
understand why my iPhone 4 already does
everything I could possibly possibly
want someone's asking me when's the next
insects warehouse sale probably not
coming for a little while if you guys
don't know our warehouse sales at NCIX
are like crazy crazy things that that
basically involved here I'm gonna switch
over to my to my other view here there
we go
crazy crazy things that involve us
selling stuff at like half of our
original cost and they go ahead and
change this to the connect tab gonna
take some questions on Twitter as well
so I'm gonna try and pay attention to
Twitter as well as the as the twitch TV
chat I'm just going to move myself a
little bit to the side here now let's do
some questions when are the 8000 series
AMD GPUs gonna be out guys I hope you
know that I cannot speculate on any kind
of upcoming upcoming video cards or
anything like that this really doesn't
work like that what do I think of the PS
Vita if you've ever tried the Vita
you'll know that the screen is actually
outstanding it's got the usual sort of
like PlayStation controls that you've
come to expect but from my perspective I
I don't see the point because we can
already use emulators on our Android
phones or we can use our well our phones
and especially if you have like a Tegra
powered phone or anything like that to
run pretty intensive games and the whole
the whole point of a handheld console to
me is really really going away very very
quickly Bryan wants me to turn down the
contrast and white balance you know what
dude there's not a whole
I can do about it this webcam sucks and
I tried playing around with the with the
colors and just yeah nothing nothing
good was happening there so way gen goo
wants to know what happened to slick
slick has not gone anywhere we have a
new intern
his name is diesel slick is 100% still
with the show in fact slick is actually
spending his entire evening tonight I
dropped by his place I had his check
I had a tablet for him to borrow for a
little while he can use it for his
schoolwork he can download textbooks or
something like that and I also dropped
him off all the latest upcoming Trinity
ap use so he has three new processors
from AMD that have a CPU and a GPU built
into them he also has the all new FX
chip so I I dropped off form other five
motherboards some competing Intel CPUs
for new AMD CPUs and 8150 and an 1100 t
just for giggles so we are gonna have a
ton of content coming up about all of
AMD's new video cards the slick is a
hundred percent on board he's working on
them and that we're very very excited
about that
I mean personally guys I really do wish
for a competitive and B I think it helps
for it helps us have a healthier
marketplace I think it gives consumers
more options and I yeah I believe it's
very very important Joseph wants to know
what I thought about the msi empower I
think I have three videos about it
Joseph I think it's awesome
I think that manufacturers stepping up
the way that they do quality control
should be the way that they're
differentiating from each other because
that's one thing if you know
manufacturer says well it has Japanese
capacitors but that doesn't mean
anything unless they're backing it up
with a longer warranty or they're really
cute seeing it in a way that means that
you will not receive a deal way I mean
MSI won't come out and say you can't get
a do a empower motherboard but I would
come out and say you pretty much can't
get an MSI empower motherboard that's
dead on arrival it should pretty much be
work should pretty much work right off
the bat MB wants to know if streams on
Twitch will be recorded and put on
YouTube absolutely they will 100% it
will
it will be happening Rhonda's is not
impressed with the new eyePHONE make a
lightning cable review on - cat tips you
know what this is sort of an interesting
suggestion four four four four one one
reason here so I'm gonna I'm gonna share
this with you guys if you guys haven't
already seen this it's gonna I forgot to
set my hotkeys for switching between
between these things so let's go ahead
and search for a thunderbolt cable you
know what I wonder how many videos there
are about Apple's Thunderbolt cable it
can't be that many and apparently yes
the Thunderbolt cable unboxing if you
guys haven't already seen this you know
I don't I don't like I don't like to
toot my own horn or anything and oh look
at this we're all gonna watch the the ad
together I'm showing you guys what not
to do don't skip the ad that's that's
bad you don't you don't want to do that
so we're gonna go to full screen here
and this is this is probably one of my
favorite videos this look and I have
ever worked on together I don't know if
can you guys hear I don't know can you
can you hear I don't know if you can
hear but basically we were we decided to
find out what the effects of opening up
a 50-dollar cable could be people are
saying no we can't hear can u hear now-u
no we cannot hear yes no no yes no you
guys are making it impossible to tell
okay whatever it doesn't matter you
don't really need the sound so we we
basically yeah we basically figured out
that if you open up one of these $50.00
cables it turns you into some kind of
phenomenal superhero and that guys
there's there's no sound there's really
no sound you all you have to do is just
kind of watch the video here and and you
can you can experience if you want to if
you really want to watch it with sound
then all you have to do is go search for
Thunderbolt cable on YouTube and and you
will you will experience something that
you will rarely experience outside of
this this particular video so I don't
know if you guys saw that we're gonna
we're gonna go back we're gonna rewind
to the part where I go flying through
the fence I was planning to fix my fence
anyway so
you can see there's actually already
holes in the fence right here see this
spot where there's a hole in the fence
so yeah since I was planning on that
anyway I decided we might as well just
try and try and break the fence and and
see how that that went for us my wife
was super impressed with this video she
she definitely thought it was our finest
work and I'm sorry the videos lagging we
are going to get better equipment soon I
actually have a couple of what are they
call Blackmagic intensity whatever the
funderbolt one the external one so I
have a couple of those coming soon and
I'm definitely excited about being able
to stream from from an HDMI capture card
as opposed to relying on sort of fail
fail stuff like like what we're doing
right now which is like webcams and and
and like audio capture and that's just
just terrible compared to what we what
we really should be using so let's go
back to let's go back to our Twitter
feed here and see if we've got any other
great questions on Twitter guys if
you're not already following me on
Twitter it's that Linus tech so make
sure you're doing that because Twitter
is going to be my primary way of
communicating during these live streams
so if you yeah if you're not on Twitter
then just just get Twitter it's really
not that hard you just sign up for it if
you people okay people have sort of an
interest everyone has a different
philosophy about social social media
social networks signing up for things so
number one Twitter is big enough that
like they're not gonna sell your
information they have a privacy policy
and corporate whatever hoo-ha that it's
not gonna be that much of a problem and
a social network is only as intrusive
and annoying as you allow it to be if
you follow every retailer who throws a
contest at you on Twitter or if you
follow every celebrity that has a staff
of six people writing tweets for them
and then posting it then yes you will
have a really obnoxious Twitter feed and
it'll become ignoring worthy however if
you just follow people that you
genuinely want to interact with then I
really don't think it's that bad I think
the lightning cables playing awesome I'm
really interested to see why the
lightning cable like is this a thunder
compatible thing is I don't know I'm
just finding this whole thing very very
confusing
although Tim Kirk claims for the iPhone
5 that the Lightning connector is
staying for a long time so yeah as for
Twitter sucking I I know I know but the
reason Twitter sucks is because of all
the spam horrible stupid content on it
like trending trending topics this is
the worst thing in the world and just
plain shouldn't exist i toast wants me
to take my server off the floor okay
i'll tell you what i toast if you buy me
a rack to install in my storage closet
then I will take my server off the floor
no big deal
- do I know anything about the iPad Mini
no no one no one really knows anything
about it ah
Lachlan wants to know what's the best
cherry MX blue keyboard you know what
pretty much any MX blue keyboard is
pretty good although out of the build
quality of the keyboards that we've
really spent time with if I was picking
something for doing lots of typing or
for gaming or actually basically for
anything I would go with the Philco just
find any Philco keyboard you can get
like the camel one or the ones with like
the writing on like the bottom or the
side of the switches or whatever it
doesn't matter
silicon keyboards are built like tanks
like they're not model end but they're
they're outstanding so yeah that's
probably what I'd go with anything from
Philco - do you have any any info but a
g-force based DK 110 card by Nvidia I
would love to explain to you guys what
an NDA is an NDA is a nondisclosure
agreement basically for anyone to tell
me anything whether they're Nvidia Intel
AMD whoever else they make me sign my
name on a piece of paper that says I
will not disclose any information about
it if I were to break an NDA I would
never get a sample of anything ever
again
so doesn't happen I will not talk about
things that aren't released unless I
have prior approval because I want to be
able to keep bringing content to you
guys and I'm not gonna be able to do
that if I can't get any video cards or
CPUs or motherboards then I'll just I'll
be like I'll be I'll be I'll be an apple
channel and I will I will talk about
Apple
Savage Joe says - I don't use Twitter so
here's my question Savage Joe learning
to use Twitter and then I will answer
your question actually I'll answer your
question anyway could an audio chip on a
motherboard Cause random freezing and
sound looping absolutely onboard audio
sucks balls
it sucks balls in every possible way you
don't use it
there are motherboards that do have
decent onboard audio something like a
Maximus for an accent rather Maximus
five formula has truly well-designed
onboard audio that has true PCB
separation from the rest of the traces
the rest of the components on the board
however 99.9 percent of boards do not
have the kind of engineering that ACS
put into that board and are terrible so
don't use them you should always be
using a real sound card and those of you
who don't believe me actually it was
great because I did a video about the a
Susa sonar DDX or a DG or something like
level ol and a su sound card and I had
someone message me like they wrote out
this long message and they were like
Linus thank you so much for enlightening
me
I always thought on board sound was fine
and you know I was on hard for him or
whatever the forum it was something
forum where they think they know a lot
but they don't I was on this forum and
everyone said sound cards are for audio
files or whatever else they're not and
someone says they have a Maximus 5
formula ok something-something anyway so
he said you know what I always thought
it was fine because people said that
it's four audio files only and you can
never tell the difference bla bla bla
I installed a cheapo sound card and my
eyes have been opened because the sound
car makes the difference to everything
you do whether it's games music movies
windows sounds it doesn't matter you
need to have a sound card
everyone needs a sound card it's not
negotiable someone has a Maximus 5 cool
story bro - do you love me from Justin
absolutely everyone who's taking the
time to be here with me at 10 o'clock my
time to just listen to me ramble about
random Hardware I love you all because
lime fire says no I don't love no yes I
do I just said I do mind you I think
there's a bit of a delay on the stream
so we
like we should give is John still here
like we should give him a hard time
about it
John fixed her fix your leg or something
BAM this is my first time using twitch
and I'm already like burning there I'm
already burning their service however
it's a hundred times better than the
bank Google Hangouts on air which I was
which I was super not impressed about
and super not not happy about because it
it it glitched out and was was generally
not very good in any way so hold on give
me two seconds here guys I'm just gonna
try and figure out if I can transition
if I can find a way to bind my scenes to
the hotkeys because there was a way
there's a way to do this and I don't
remember how to do it okay you know what
forget it I'll just keep doing the mouse
speaking of in speaking of YouTube live
streams for those of you who don't know
I'm trying to communicate as much as I
can I will be uploading these twitch
livestreams to YouTube when I'm done so
if you miss them you can watch them on
YouTube no problem and black sudo site
it's suit suit suit OS ID says he has to
go and I'm very sorry in the future I'm
probably gonna be moving these live
streams back an hour so it'll be 9:00
p.m. my time which will be midnight
Eastern Standard Time which is better
for better for Canadians and I mean the
rest of the world I'm sorry but I've had
no matter what time I do it at someone
from Asia or someone from Europe is
gonna tell okay remember guys there's 24
time zones in the world not counting
like the ones that don't count like
Newfoundland where they're like half an
hour ahead
so there's 24 major time zones and then
everyone during that time probably is
sleeping for eight hours and at work for
eight hours so there is a there is like
a 2 in 3 chance that no matter what time
I stream at you won't be able to watch
it because you're at work or because
you're sleeping so I can only do so much
and I really appreciate those of you who
are tuning in no matter what time it is
Luka said SWS - something says it's 7
a.m. his time dude I wouldn't be up if
it was 7 a.m. so I really appreciate
that you guys are awesome in every
possible way
Salman Salman elite wants to know why
there haven't been any Linus cat tips
videos
honestly it's been a bit of a well here
I'm gonna go get my I'm gonna go get my
camera and I'll explain why with a prop
so I'll be back in two seconds was that
two seconds I hope that was pretty good
okay so this camera this is my high-end
camera this is my x8n this camera I
usually don't transport to and from home
so I this is the only one that performs
half decent in my house because my house
doesn't have a great lighting and my
regular blob blob blob camera blob
camera blow up my blog camera the SX one
is cannot capture video in my house
worth crap so the only times I can
really use it on weekends because I work
during the day and on weekends I like to
spend time with my family as much as I
possibly can when I'm not like
benchmarking stuff and whatnot so and as
for you guys complaining about the
washed out colors I will be dealing with
it soon okay just relax
so anyway right so this camera I don't
usually bring it home and so there's no
time to film the cat's they're adorable
still I love them to death and they're
always up to their antics but I will be
looking at bringing the line as cat tips
channel back once we get ourselves a
couple of new Panasonic cameras and I
can start transporting this one around
with me as my general purpose blog
camera so yes very exciting stuff Linus
from the brimstone is there any real
difference between the GTX 670 m and a
desktop GTX 670 yes all the difference
in the world
mobile graphics cards are very
underpowered compared to their desktop
equivalence basically the the naming
schemes on notebook graphics cards seem
to be designed to be as confusing as
possible so just just give up now the
only thing that you can do is you can
find a review where someone has
benchmarked a notebook with that
graphics card and that'll give you some
idea how it'll perform that's pretty
much all you can do let's see if we can
get to some more Twitter questions here
guys
John Norton
to know NSI or a sous for an LGA 1155
socket well first of all if you buy a
socket by itself you're not gonna get
the functionality that you expect from
that product because the socket is not
actually what delivers the communication
between the CPU and the rest of your
system you will need a full motherboard
to go with that socket and I would
definitely suggest to you that actually
either MSI races are great options right
now for gamers I would particularly take
a look at the empower board from MSI it
actually has an incredibly full feature
set for the price plus it has that extra
QC they're putting into it or the
saber-tooth from Asus which comes with a
five-year warranty
and their thermal armor which is not
really that important for cooling but
looks badass in your system especially
if you want to go for like a nice clean
build and those of you who are into get
Jason Cheng yes I play badminton calm
down stop typing in all caps something
not lost fire that's what I was talking
about right so the saber-tooth looks
badass you want nice clean cabling you
want like a sweet-looking gaming system
lighting effects and stuff so yes it's a
very good choice either of them are good
anything from the big three Asus MSI
Giga Byte those are your big three a lot
of people are starting to count ass rock
I don't yet I need to see it proven to
me first and I just really haven't
really haven't had much experience with
their board so I don't feel that
confident recommending them alright
Daniel says at what point in your life
did you decide to make a living off
unboxing benchmarking etc electronic
products I do not make a living off of
what I do here on the interwebs at least
not yet I make a living as a product
manager at NCIX in fact I'd love to
share with you guys another YouTube
video here so I'm just going to this is
this is a series that I've started doing
and I'd love to change this into a live
show at some point but this is net
linked weekly you can watch all the
episodes on the tube and in episode I
believe its net linked weekly episode 8
I actually interview myself about my job
so I
I pose this you okay you know it's funny
because here this is hilarious okay so
this is an aside Google's Terms of
Service dictate to me but I cannot
intentionally use my own ads to drive
revenue to myself so why does it serve
me ads when I'm watching my videos some
of which are unskipable this is like
paradox mine screwy that's going on here
because I can't skip the ad I want to
watch my own video but if I watch the ad
then I will be violating YouTube's Terms
of Service I mean can they can they ban
me from YouTube for watching my own ad
it's like unbelievable anyway sorry
let's switch back so so in this episode
of net linked weekly I interview me
let's just make the player a little
bigger here so you guys can actually see
what's going on at least I think I do in
this episode if it's the wrong one ah
yes here we go so I ask myself like a
question and then I I magically appear
in the shot to answer the question and I
actually I actually changed my shirt in
between every shot and see I answered my
own question I actually put sunglasses
on so if you got yes I know there's no
sound calm down I haven't figured out
how to do it so anyway this this was
this was this was fun
and you guys should definitely subscribe
to the NCI XCOM channel so that you can
you can definitely check out this weekly
content as well as all the other videos
I do over there in fact I'll - tech tips
existed for the sole purpose of unboxing
the products just doing like shoki quick
showcases of the product I mean to
improve our time to market with the
videos for NCIX tech tips video so if
you go back and some of the older NCIX
tech tips videos I'm just gonna gonna
bring up the the NCIX channel here and
I'll flip over to that on scene 3
because I'm like totally managing the
like the scenes I'm using xsplit like a
mouse actually I'm not using xsplit like
a boss I'm using exploit like
that's horrible and doesn't know doesn't
know how to use it so let's go back to
some of the older episodes like when did
we start doing unboxings I think we
started doing unboxings around the time
yeah it was definitely after the vas
okay now I've gotten confused and I've
lost track of what's going on it was
around the launch of socket 1156 I yes
so like around the time we started doing
oh maybe it wasn't okay you know what
I'd given up on this I'm just gonna
switch back to the other scene and let's
just let's just let's just forget about
that whole thing and let that ever
happened because I clearly have no idea
what I'm talking about
so Daniel in short I didn't Marc I live
in Korea where people are glued to their
phones and tablets to the point where it
scares me well the same happen elsewhere
I believe so in fact I was having an
argument with one of my co-workers not
that long ago where I suggested to him
that what will happen and that and that
it's happening today that no one will
actually know how to drive their car
anywhere because for me when I first
started driving and you couldn't you
didn't know where you were going you had
someone like draw on a piece of paper
and like label it it was usually
inaccurate or you actually kept a
physical map in your car and then you
would pull over and read it and like try
to figure out where you were going
whereas now this is the funniest thing
and I'm gonna I'm totally gonna burn
slick here because he's such a like kids
today in this way he doesn't know how to
get from his house to our studio he
follows Google Maps every time he cannot
do it by memory and this backed up my
argument with my coworker which was last
summer when I said kids are not going to
know how to navigate the road and
they're not gonna know how to use maps
because they don't have to they are
going to grow up with turn-by-turn
available to them at all times and the
world is changing to the point where
you're not gonna actually have to
remember anything like when I again same
thing when I was growing up you had to
remember a phone number to call someone
if you couldn't remember a girl's phone
number you didn't write it down
somewhere like like like that was it
whereas now with the convenience of of
contact lists and lists and address
books
III don't know anybody's number I know
my own number I know my wife's number
and I know my work number I know my
parents number but guys feel free post
in the chat post in the chat on the
twitch TV how many phone numbers do you
actually know whereas when I was in
elementary school I knew all my friends
phone numbers I knew you know all my
relatives phone numbers there you go
I think I think things are changing
people asking how how old I am I am 26
so there you go
so I've been doing YouTube videos since
I was about 21 and 22 and see see people
are replying I know 911 actly five five
four six eleven thirty people don't
remember phone numbers anymore and
that's why that's what made me think of
this whole map thing this navigation
thing if you have a phone that's just
gonna tell you what to do and will even
do it smarter than you can cuz it'll
tell you when there's traffic it'll tell
you if there's a road block it'll tell
you if there's a cop why would you ever
memorize it anymore very very
interesting stuff okay um Matt wants to
know if you have a 2600 K already wait
for Haswell or not worth upgrading
probably not worth upgrading to Ivy
Bridge especially if you're an
overclocker
the the performing it is it's a it's
either a tick or a talk it's whichever
one is the process ring without that
many architectural improvements so wait
for the big the big architectural
improvements Thor h13 wants to be a mod
okay done if you want to block the porn
links then feel free my friend make it
happen sir alright moving on right along
something best Linus video ever sweet uh
have I heard about the Alec I think
we're back to where oh my goodness two
hundred two hundred and fourteen new
interactions what am I going to do with
you guys I should show you some high
school pictures you know what if you're
subscribed on Twitter or following on
Twitter I guess would be the correct
terminology it wasn't a high school
picture but this is this is one of my
elementary school pictures this is just
it was just fantastic you guys are gonna
love this I had the most outstanding
mullet and like buck-toothed overbite
that you ever did see
check this out I'm just gonna hold this
up to the camera I hope this kind of
works that is me when I was in
elementary school is that is that not
like legendary hair right there oh there
we go it's finally popped into focus so
why would I not post old pictures of
myself I think that that should be that
should be evident based on that picture
that I just shared with y'all see for my
American viewers y'all I'm gonna say
y'all and a and I got huh
someone burned me today at work for
calling it ocz because apparently as I
say I can never remember I use Z and Zed
interchangeably I think these are very
minor details in life Stephen wants to
know how do I think my son will think of
me when he grows up I have no idea
because there will be so much video I
mean I thought about this because so
much of what I've done over the last
four years it's like documented on the
Internet and try as I might to to to
erase any of it it's just it's there
forever that's what that's what you
realize at a certain point so check this
out
Linus top moments or something like that
like some guy lioness moments I don't I
don't I don't remember where it is but
some moments they're there I think I
think this is the one it might be him it
might be someone else like people do
compilations of like me on the internet
that is to me like the strangest thing
the strangest thing ever but like I mean
look at this
I think there's I think there's another
one and no I'm not planning any Linux
builds
Tec I don't know I don't remember I
don't remember what it's called but it's
somewhere I I encountered it a little
while ago someone like made this video
that was just a bunch of random random -
tech tips - Texas moments but it really
made me realize that no matter what I do
I will always be sort of there on the
internet on one of the other moments I
had about this was to do with not only
my my own persistence on the interwebs
but also cloud computing so if you guys
haven't seen these sorry I'm gonna
switch back to that to that other window
NCIX cloud watch this episode because it
didn't get a whole lot of views but I
think what you guys can see here is from
the like to dislike ratio which is 2002
14 it was actually an outstanding video
that we did where I talked a lot about
the the level of discomfort I have over
what happened when my accounts got
hijacked so if you guys haven't been
subscribed for a long time about a year
ago both of my accounts got hijacked
someone got a keylogger on my machine
took them over wiped out all my videos
posted a bunch of spam videos it took me
about a month to get them back dealing
with dealing with partner support
dealing with Google's support team which
was non-existent at the time but they've
been quite a bit better since then and
what happened when I got in touch with
Google's support was they not only
restored my channel which is great but
they restored every video I had ever
deleted as well so things like test
footage that we that we are that we
uploaded a long time ago things like
like videos that we never intended to
release all just got released and what I
realized is you never delete anything
from the cloud at all and how terrifying
is that because it means that your data
will always be there so that's that's
why I created my own off-site backup
server and I do try to turn all of my I
do try to turn all of my what I
right I do try to store all of my data
on my own servers as opposed to using
services like Dropbox or whatever else -
I have wanted to ask this for ages are
you streaming from a kitchen I am an
absolutely streaming from a kitchen I
would love to share with you guys my
kitchen this is my kitchen so this is my
rice cooker this is my juice jug this is
my saran wrap this is my powerline
adapter box so I'm using powerline now
guys I am NOT using wireless for my
stream this week okay power line is is a
beastly that is my Tropicana which I
should have some of that is my
shepherd's pie which was freaking
delicious my wife made it and dad is the
tinfoil that was covering the shepherd's
pie that is an oven mitt that is my
bread box that's my butter dish that's
my microwave these are my cabinets okay
I don't have a degree for those of you
asking that is my fridge that is my
backpack that I carry my things in this
is my babies
swinging seat that is a laundry hamper
which is in the kitchen for you know
probably a good reason this is my cereal
see delicious right mini wheats and
behind it is honey nut cheerios
and that is cream of wheat this is my
dish rack this is my paper towels this
is my recycling pile but I take out once
in a while my cabinets are here and
there's more cabinets behind there but
you can't see them that is my water
cooler that is a bunch of baby crap that
you can see because I have a baby that
is his bouncy seat right there with his
foams our hibbett is a stuffed animal
sock and his soccer ball that I throw
and he likes out that's my dinner okay
gotten things things got too real there
my dinner AJR I'm sorry it's so late we
can potentially look at changing the
time of the stream at some point but
yeah nothing we can do for this week
because it's already started so let's go
ahead and go back to our go back to our
go back to our Twitter and see if we can
find anything that anyone wants
wants to hear about lioness it's flip do
I stay with LGA 1155 or LGA 2011 cuz I
just built a new PC with 1155 pickle
1155 for now
in fact the highest-end chips yeah are
are on LGA 1155 right now in terms of
quad course matt says where does linus
live this live show is crap I would like
to know how those two things are related
Matt I am definitely waiting for you to
post a follow-up to that because I want
to know why where I live is related to
my live show not being very good and I'm
very sorry my live show is not very good
what is oh that's a good question Justin
four five six five four wants to know
what is your favorite looking GPU of all
time the GTX 480 is my favorite looking
GPU not my favorite GPU in general but
definitely my favorite looking GPU those
heat pipes that came out of the top of
it are just like oh they're just so
amazing I mean for those of you who
don't know what a GTX 480 looks like it
is just a thing of beauty and it's a
thing of beauty out of necessity I mean
I don't think Nvidia wanted to spend
this much on that cooler Wow look at
that my favorite review site hardware
connects there you go that is what a GTX
480 looks like this this was all metal
so what point in the wrong way that was
all metal on the top I have never seen
that since except for the GTX 690 which
does use a metal shroud but this metal
was involved in the cooling because this
GPU ran so friggin hot and those heat
pipes that came out of the top made it
incompatible with a number of cases but
like oh they looked so good
slicks actually running my my review
sample of GTX 480 and Matt mace says you
read I was just saying the live show is
crap it was legging for me oh you mean
it's crap it's legging on it's crap I
suck at doing live streams
although hey focus although it's
possible that I suck at doing live
streams but this is still practice for
me this is only
my third live stream so far so I'm still
trying to get the hang of it anyway GTX
480 is by far my favorite looking GPU
right slick still using it and he's like
he doesn't even want to change it just
because it looks so sexy and good and
awesome so back to Twitter all right
what do we got um moving right along
will you be doing reviews for the new
hybrid i3 it's not really I mean why I'm
really interested in getting one for
gaming I need an expert opinion Adam
West do not get it for gaming even AMD's
last generation ap use are dramatically
better for gaming than an Intel Ivy
Bridge chip if you do a search for AP
you NCIX you guys will find not this one
ah yes this guy right here the
integrated graphics IGP showdown Intel
Ivy Bridge versus AMD Llano and more ads
I'm sorry for ads guys but ads really do
keep the NCIX tech tips project going in
a big way and wow my hair was
outstanding in this video so by the end
of this video I believe we put up some
graphs that show the the APU just just
absolutely demolishing even the
higher-end Ivy Bridge chips remember
these were I sevens and oh hold on hold
on wait for it yes I sevens and I fives
not i3 is just getting destroyed and yes
if this is the real Adam West and I'm a
huge fan and if it's not the Adam West
then you imposter how dare you defile
his good name asking questions about I
threes on the Internet
have I ever heard of her used to Astro
gaming headsets sorry no dice although
if everyone who recommends everyone who
asked me for a headset recommendation
gets pretty much the same one I'm a huge
fan of the SteelSeries 7h best audio
quality for a gaming headset by far the
Asus Vulcan ANC is actually okay and say
by far because the Vulcan Agency is
closed and has active noise-cancelling
and then after that it's just it's a mix
because I mean people people are like oh
I heard the Siberia of u2's really
where did you hear the vite Siberia v2
is really good like who told you this
where are you guys getting information
from you should be watching my channel
if you want information because yeah
Siberia t2 is like yeah it's not good
it's comfortable so it's kind of like
the it's like the Corsair Vengeance oo
1300 or 1500 it's like it's comfortable
but this is not groundbreaking audio
quality by any stretch of the
imagination guys don't kid yourself
you want a good headset you buy a good
headset not like a 40 50 $60 headset
it's not going to be good this is a
terrible headset and it's already
uncomfortable I've only been wearing it
for a while
Kyle Harris wants to know if my wife
gets along with us sir I would think so
they're sisters moving right along
Isabella hi Oh Linus showed this tweet
on your live cam PS my boyfriend loves
your videos there you go Isabella you
are live or if you're watching this on
YouTube after the live stream then
you're not live okay hi I love your show
it's your opinion skills here 7g so are
similar keyboard you suggest I actually
did a huge episode a huge mechanical
keyboard round up I know this is just
turning into Linus schooling you guys on
how if you actually watched my videos
here I bet it's the first hit if I
search for a mechanical keyboard BAM
other than the ad first hit mechanical
keyboard overview and showcase featuring
pretty much every brand that matters
look at all those keyboards we have what
is it twelve keyboards here so if you
guys paid attention you would already
know the answer to that question which
is that the 7g is a great keyboard but
but the key caps sometimes fall off the
hand are the wrist rest on it is
outstanding my wife refuses to use
anything but a 7g due to the awesome
wrist rest it looks ridiculous
but it is so comfortable to type one so
I would definitely recommend the 7g if
you want the best wrist rest ever
personally I'm using a me onyx Bible 60
right now which is my favorite well I
put my videos on DVD you want a
collection why don't you just
get a pillow a OS like media set-top box
and then use YouTube to watch them
because I'm never taking them off
YouTube that won't happen
ah arrow wants to say to me use Chrome
with adblock for skipping YouTube ads I
don't believe in skipping YouTube ads I
actually make a well now I don't make a
living off of it but I I supplement my
my income with YouTube ads so it's kind
of like asking like like software
developers to pirate they usually have
some qualms about that because their
entire livelihood relies on people not
pirating software so yeah just so you
know your kitchen looks awesome thank
you
I think my kitchen is awesome too
outstanding ah great question from John
Zoidberg and if you're the real John
Zoidberg big fan colored tubes are
colored water for a custom water loop
colored tubes for sure custom water
causes so many problems because it just
always going something like everybody
claims that their solution to the
colored water problem is it's gonna
cause it to not gunk up but it always
does
so yeah colored tubes in fact there is
no reason for any tubing to exist other
than primo flex by primo chill they have
outstanding colored tubes that also are
antimicrobial so you don't have to put
any other additives in your water and
they look outstanding Talley says read
my Twitter I will try but I can only get
through so many of them okay
difference between the 660 and the 660ti
well performance the actual GPU that
they're using or clock speed the
functional units the price what do you
want me to tell you man ah simran Gill
says how do I read tweets like you do I
have no idea I think you can search for
like at Linus tech and that might help
but I'm not not on a processor Josh
wants to know what about EVGA and I
suspect this is in the context of what I
said earlier about the big three Asus
gigabyte MSI if you're talking about
motherboards I personally don't really
in using any motherboard that is not a
volume component so though the ones
where they sell like hundreds of
thousands of them those are the ones
that tend to get the after sales support
because if they didn't do it then
there'd be lots of customers who would
be vocal about not supporting it so
anything that's not a volume part I
generally avoid and that includes every
EVGA motherboard ever accept their six
ATI board so I mean I I like I like
their yeah I like their boards and I
mean but I just yeah
for video cards though fine yes EVGA is
a big three for video cards in fact
there the rumor has it that they sell
like more high-end video cards in North
America than everyone else combined
they're enormous
move on down what I say the asou sense
is still my favorite sound card no
there's a better one I forget if it's
the ST or the STX but there's one that's
actually better I just use the since
because it has that sexy chrome cover on
it that I really like alright so we've
gotten down to where we had left off on
tweets so Oh 188 new interactions wow
you guys are you guys are crazy and late
yeah crazy stuff Daniel says Linus this
liquid works perfect Daniel you're wrong
whether you think you're right or you
think you're wrong you're wrong because
it doesn't work and at some point it
will gunk they all do I just don't care
anymore use yeah use something the other
thing use colored tubes someone wants me
to answer the Peter Douglas Doug's Peter
deuces tweet I don't I don't see it yet
at least not yet shout out to fans in
South Africa Heil South Africa I really
don't think there are that many of you
but if there if there are any then
fantastic thank you for viewing my
livestream I'm actually curious to know
if you guys can just sort of post in the
chat or posting it in Twitter I'd love
to hear how you found the live stream
tonight because I had peep
request that I post a video on youtube
about it so are most of you following me
here from the YouTube posting or or
what's the deal YouTube YouTube YouTube
YouTube YouTube okay okay so that I'm
probably gonna keep doing that then I'll
just post a video that the live stream
is coming and you guys can tune in and
and yeah that battle that looks like
it's gonna be the better okay alright
calm down that's enough okay I got the
point YouTube you guys just killing you
here ah Julian wants to know if I'll
ever dye my hair again um you know what
not unless there's some kind of a
particular and yes shout out to Prince
Rupert I've been there once before
my family had a devastating car accident
a car accident near Prince Rupert once
my mom broke her back my sister broke
her arm yeah yeah my mom suffered a head
injury that actually caused her to lose
her ability to read however I would like
you guys to know that she made a full
recovery and she is she's a teacher now
and she finished her degree and she she
uh some outstanding lady outstanding
lady cuz she was in a coma and was had a
head injury to the point where she
basically couldn't remember who any of
her family were and made me one heck of
a comeback okay last shout out to
Victoria no more shout outs because
shout outs are basically a waste of time
cuz no one but you cares you and
Victoria you day wants to know if I met
Esther first or my wife I met my wife
first
Esther is my wife's is sister ash wants
to know do now his questions boring I'm
not su wants to know if I will ever do a
four by GTX 680 versus two by GTX 690
test the answer is no because it doesn't
matter the GTX 680 and the GTX 690 have
exactly the same number of functional
units which means that and they're both
going to be in four-way SLI so there's
no there's no mystical sort of anything
going on here the performance will be
the same and the price is the same so
yeah whatever
just by whichever one that you like 691
overclock as well the six ATS will
overclock better so yeah bear that in
mind
moving right along would I recommend a
2500 care 35 7 UK for moderate gaming
they're both pretty similar with the 35
70k being a little better and also a
little bit more expensive Rob wants a
personal rig update if he watched my
youtube videos he would know that
actually no he wouldn't know if he was
subscribed on Twitter if he was
following me on Twitter he would know I
have found a motherboard the x79 s UD
up5 Wi-Fi is going to be my motherboard
it is absolutely silent and and it's
just awesome new day - did Esther
introduce you to your now wife or did
your wife introduce you to Esther and
she happened to be an NCI ex I got
Esther her job at NCI X I've been with
ncx for six years if you guys go back
and find out sort of when Esther started
at n Texas only a few years ago so at
that time I was already I was either
engaged or in a serious relationship
with her sister and I I knew that Esther
had a thing for you know social media so
so that was uh that was how what went
down that was how it happened there are
two staff members in here staff members
of what can you tell in some way that
there are staff members like how does
this work
I'm just curious
like are they marked are they over
wrench
Fuzzy's otter balls are you all just
totally inappropriate why do you have
names like that involve like yeah see
you're talking you're talking about EP
in here totally inappropriate your your
band
I should ban you can I can I been a
staff member I'm gonna try just for fun
I'm gonna but I'm gonna bring this over
here so you guys can all see what
happens if I try to kick a staff member
on voice Dan did it work oh my goodness
it worked okay can i unban him oh oh oh
hold on hold on I'm trying to unban him
I can't I can't do it I can't it's
moving too fast you guys are moving to
get too fast
oh he says no I'm not bad okay well now
we know what happens it tells me he's
been but it doesn't actually ban him so
we have learned something today if
nothing else
Elmo Riggs wants to know if I am going
to Malaysia any time soon I may be going
to Malaysia sometime soon there's a
family reunion sometime next year and I
might go or I might not Joel don't your
your question is legendary for a number
of reasons are they twin sisters no but
they're Asian and if you're white then
you probably think they all look the
same
anyway and that is very insensitive of
you there are not twins - this is a teef
yeah yeah that's probably a worthwhile
upgrade Polsky Yi wants to know my
opinion on the fractal core 1000 great
question I believe I have a video about
this if I could figure out how to oh did
I break it is the livestream working I
switch to the wrong scene oh okay okay
hold on hold on and oh there we go yes I
have a video about this if you search
for core 1000 my search rankings are so
good fractal design core 1000 top hit
you just got you just got bamned so many
people ask me for ask me for like
recommendations or like ask me to do
videos about stuff only to discover that
I have already done a video about it and
then there's new eggs video look at
those guys look at Paul's arms Oh in all
seriousness no I like I like Paul but
see he has he has 24 thousand views and
I have 45,000 views
ha but all but but again in all
seriousness Paul's a good guy let's go
back to Twitter there we go I should
just be using the same browser for this
so that I don't have to like break it
every time
ah rings who wants to know if I've ever
answered this but what is my
about RAM disks my opinion is that
they're not really that useful unless
you have a lot of RAM so I haven't
really I've really gotten to that yet
Chris has a great question Chris Linus
do you think arm will ever expand into
the desktop market absolutely but not
directly arm does not actually make make
processors like that that go into
products they rely on their partners
such as Nvidia to integrate ARM
processors with some of the other
components that are needed to build the
system on a chip and I believe that many
of those partners are definitely
expecting desktop computers to happen
with arm technology powering them we're
going to see great power efficiency and
good enough performance although I
suspect for anyone watching this stream
or subscribe to my channel that
performance won't be good enough but
there we go Adam West I didn't mean I
wanted to use the IGP of the i3 I meant
I wanted to use it for the processing
power then in that case yes and i3 is a
perfectly valid choice for a gaming
machine the one drawback is that you
won't be able to overclock really peter
has a great question Peter
so burger burger really silver Berger
GTX 680 is main card would a GTX 560 Ti
be good for a dedicated physics card or
would it throttle the system no
throttling but I don't see the point
because your GTX 680 is already so
powerful that by the time it like
allocates a little bit of its power for
processing physics stuff then it won't
actually detract from the overall
performance that much I actually did a
really oh I did a really cool test back
when Batman Arkham Asylum launched where
I used a passive 8800 GT as a physics
card and the temperature on the card
while running the game with maximum
physics on didn't change which suggests
to me that there's not a whole lot of
processing going on although newer games
like Borderlands 2 might be different
Liza Berg I did not bash you on the live
stream I just said that I would be
immortalized on the Internet
in part due to you Liza Berg is the guy
who made that video see he's in the he's
in the twitch TV chat stikeez asks me
what do I think of Maxie shine Maxie
shine is the the bloke right the Maxie
shine
oh no wait no I don't hold on what was
what's what's Maxie shining and Maxie
shine oh no that's not that's not the
one I'm thinking of I'm thinking of
troubadour
I don't know I don't I don't know if I
think a whole lot about Maxie shine wow
he's got a lot of subscribers actually
here's a cool tool you guys yeah I don't
know if you have actually here I'm gonna
switch to my other I'm gonna switch to
my other scene here there we go check
this out this is what I use to track to
track blade comm slash YouTube slash
user slash Linus tech tips so this is
what I use to track YouTube junk it's
actually just this phenomenally cool
tool so you can see the daily change in
subscribers video views channel views
you can see trends over time which is
really really cool
this numbers totally meaningless guys
don't don't assume that it socially it
doesn't suck I use it I like it
so whatever all because of gamer name de
draak I'm not gonna talk about it
anymore
they're black screen for you I'm just
messin no black screen let's go back to
Twitter okay Chaz wants to know what do
you think would be the best time to buy
or build a PC Black Friday's coming up
and I was wondering if that's a good
idea
absolutely Black Friday is an excellent
time to do - sorry someone says they're
a ten-year-old moderator I don't care as
long as you're willing to be more mature
than that guy who is posting crap last
time around
yes Black Friday is an excellent time to
build a PC because there's great prices
Michael wants to know how do I know
slick was even friend before you worked
at NCIX actually slick and I did not
know each other before he came to work
at NCIX

longer looking for an assistant and I'd
have people messaging me all the time
but this is the video this was the video
job job posting that I created in order
to in order to have here we go someone
join me on tech tips
so I basically said I needed someone who
could work flexible hours and who was
technical and and and that my old
yeah and that my old whatever it's
called being my old camera man wasn't
gonna be able to help me anymore cuz he
was just too darn busy and that was that
was how the recruitment process went and
slick was out of actually I got a ton of
applicants many of which who were
awesome like I had ten people I think or
so that I that I interviewed and I had
probably twenty or thirty resumes that
were good enough to interview but I just
had to I had to narrow it down had to
narrow it down yeah yeah all right

unboxings on the nvidia gtx 660 are you
freaking kidding me
do i have to school you again alright
schooling time here we go we're gonna go
on the youtube and we're gonna search
for gtx 660 we're gonna see what comes
up ah new egg beat me there's me BAM no

yeah so there's at least two front page
results for me oh there's the unboxing
oh no that's motherboard story okay
they're thumbnails similar to mine
good old Elric but yeah there's plenty
of plenty of content about gtx 660 so
feel free to check it out and if you if
you don't already know about it
check out hardware cannot say do
fantastic video reviews fantastic video
or not video reviews fantastic written
reviews that are that are great and just
awesome garrett more
you really know your tech stuff so why
do you use an iphone over an android
phone and i because i like it what do
you want me to say it's it's outstanding
it's a great experience as a user i
enjoy it so ha you can think of that
what you will know okay we have time for

question earlier in the livestream you
need to tune in on time you wasted the
last question for everyone alright new
one Alex do you have a favorite
antivirus program yes malwarebytes was
the one that I was able to clear out my
my stupid key logger with I also had a
