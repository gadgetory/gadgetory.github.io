a lot of consideration into things like
thus leaving job that's been done on the
power supply they're buying or other
aesthetic factors when they're building
their PC but you still see most people
using the SATA cables that come with
their motherboard rather they're hideous
red or ugly yellow or whatever they are
so today I'm just having a look at a few
different SATA cables these are some mod
smart SATA cables they come in a variety
of different lengths in a variety of
different configurations in a variety of
different colors so a couple things
first of all we can get them in either
10 inch or 18 inch lengths and you can
see that they're also available with a
variety of different connectors for
example the red one I have here has a
right angle connector on it okay and
they'll also a straight connector
whereas the silver one is two straight
connectors how about that but they also
have some other interesting attributes
and the one that I'm about to grab
that's charging on my light here is very
interesting because it is also
glow-in-the-dark check that out not
everyone wants to have their cables only
glow after they charge them though so
I'm gonna show you a couple of the other
colors that are available these are the
well red green and blue ones and you
actually need a blacklight or a UV light
in order to make these stand out at
their best so I have a UV light it looks
kind of purple if you look at it
directly but if you have the lights
positioned in your case so that you
don't see the cathodes directly but
rather you only see the things glowing
in their light the effect can be quite
stunning so you can see that they're
glowing a little bit right now but when
I turn the light off you'll see that
they get their full effect here so let
me just show you I have the the blue
green and red ones on display here so
the blue is on now your left and the
green is in the middle and the red is on
the right it looks kind of pinkish but
the effect is still pretty good when you
have it going in your case anyway thank
you for checking out my there's my smile
thanks for checking out my unboxing of
the mod smart SATA cables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
