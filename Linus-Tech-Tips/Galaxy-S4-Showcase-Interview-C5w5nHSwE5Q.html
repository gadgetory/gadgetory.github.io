to tell us all about the ipad oh oh I
just threw that at you oh my god and
what are you talking about here to talk
about the galaxy s4 horse we are so you
guys are calling this the life companion
device what does that even mean sure
well I think first of all it's an
acknowledgment of how important for
these devices are to us whatever they
are we happen to think we make the best
one obviously but the galaxy s4 can be
you know part of your life in the way so
you expect through communication and
entertainment and consumption but we
thought of other things that you can do
with a device that's so intimate and as
part of your life such as monitoring
your personal health for example okay so
in this way we think we've thought of a
very complete way in which the device
fits into your life so let's uh let's go
into one feature that I thought was
really cool and I want to get right into
s translator sure because on the galaxy
s3 was built for humans was the tagline
right so this is built for humans who
have a life I guess yeah absolutely and
one of the things that you're going to
do in your life is travel ok or you're
in this country in particular you're
going to encounter a situation where
maybe you want to make a simple
communication and have that translate on
the fly ok now when they first demoed
this to me it was German which I wasn't
able to validate if it was actually
correct anyway so go ahead and say
something and let's see the French
translation sure well actually I thought
this might be something even better if
you I just want to make sure there's no
complaining afterwards so I think you
should be the guy to avoid any up alarm
let me out cancel let's try this one
more time speak English to avoid
complaint so we're having me do the
voiceover
all right there you go it actually works
or some simple phrases that are in the
device itself so you don't want
constantly need a network connection but
we have also integrated this feature
into messaging into email and into the
web browser so that you can do
translations that are more complicated
using network services and it works with
both text and voice correct you can play
right that's exactly correct very very
cool so it with respect to sort of
making it part of your life tell me
about air motion sure well there are a
number of gestures that we have been
able to build in because of the sensors
you know we take advantage of the fact
there's a front facing camera for
example to keep the screen on and that's
something that folks that are familiar
with the galaxy s3 or note 2 will
recognize we've also been able to use
sensors that allow you to actually just
you're at the phone to either turn it on
or two to show notifications or to be
able to scroll web pages and gallery and
your gallery photo without actually
having to touch the phone the advantage
being you know the less touching the
less accumulation of fingerprints on the
screen and that kind of thing so show me
an example of that with your fancy
little windowed case you've got over
there sure well for example I mean even
with the windowed case for this light
magnetic sensor in here and so you can
see that I have a home screen that when
I chunk when I close the home screen I
don't have to keep the screen on
constantly so I'm not draining the whole
battery but it is giving me you know
basic information if a call comes in i
can actually swipe from left to right
and it'll receive that call very very
well when it when the screen dims out as
such as you saw there i can actually
just wave over the phone and suddenly
you know information will appear that
shows me whether i have messages or
phone calls received battery information
other things that i could set up great
for if you're in a meeting so for
example right now while you're supposed
to be talking to me you could have just
as easily been checking your text me i
could have been yeah i wasn't doing that
though really I wasn't I'm not sure if I
believe you tell me about s health sure
well another you know advantage of
having advice with you all the time
would be to or another application your
use case would be in monitoring your
activity level the kinds of food and the
calories that your that
taking in and you know what we noticed
is that there are a number of
applications that are out there which
are good but they're all kind of in and
of themselves as somewhat fragmented so
our idea was to create a widget or a hub
that would allow you know all these data
sources to come together so that you
could get a meaningful way of keeping
track of it so you get your pedometer
you get your caloric intake you can log
your exercise you can even take pictures
of your food and log it in there am i
right that's right in fact and that's
one thing that we noticed with some of
the applications that such as barcode
readers and sort of thing that it's you
weren't able to sort of customized so if
you weren't don't happen to be eating
the food that was served by that program
for example there's no way to put that
in so you know we try to allow people to
customize apps and that's an example
okay now a camera is another part of the
whole with you all the time part of your
your life thing what have you guys done
to make the camera dramatically better
sure and well people would expect the
hardware to be better so it happens to
have a 13 megapixel camera which will be
interesting but because of the
processing power and the speed of the
device we're actually able to do things
that that take advantage of that so for
example you know if you're anything like
me and if you take a lot of pictures
you're probably not in pictures very
often so being able to take a picture
simultaneously while you but and put
yourself in that by taking a picture
with the rear facing and the front
facing camera at the same time is
something that you can do something that
we call dual shot and does that work
with with video as well it does so for
example you know maybe on the hero
roller coaster and you want to see your
own reaction as you're going down you'd
be able to take a video of of the actual
roller coaster experience and your
reaction to being on that roller coaster
at the same time very cool so it takes a
lot of features as well from the Galaxy
camera like your best photo your your
best face where you can swap out photo
swap out faces get rid of blinking but
tell me about story albums and share
shot sure well with the share shot for
exec you know we partner that with the
fact that with the with the galaxy s4 as
we started with the gs3 you get a 50
gigabyte two year subscription to drop
box so you can set that Dropbox account
up so that it'll automatically back your
photo
which we know can be a pain that those
are maybe some of the more painful
things you lose if you ever lose your
device so having that kind of
connectivity and backup is a good idea
for users absolutely with the story
album you know again this is something
that we notice you know you sort of
create an ascetic experiences you can
tag the photos or you can choose from
the gallery and you can create a quick
album experience for the device or you
can get that printed out in fact you can
even get a book made we have a
partnership with blurb in a number of
countries where you can publish your
story book album and have a book
hardcover book received oh that's very
cool actually my wife had a blurb book
done once she said the process was
pretty painless overall so there there's
something we haven't talked about
enforcement that's great this is
something that I didn't say was going to
be on our agenda but I want you to talk
about the ad hoc Wi-Fi functionality so
music pictures documents games this is
cool sure absolutely well Samsung is all
about sharing in multiple ways we have
you know different radios for different
purposes but one thing we noticed that
even with what we done with the gs3 in
the note was creating an ad hoc
peer-to-peer network using Wi-Fi direct
rather than just being in a similar
network domain I'd realized that's a
little you know techy but but you know
being able to quickly share a music
experience or photos or a document or
play a game without needing any kind of
network except the network that could be
created through Wi-Fi direct and the
device itself so that's really what the
idea is there okay tell me about watch
on so you've got an infrared remote
built into the phone this is something
that we haven't seen before from you
guys on the Galaxy S series is it that's
right not on the phones we've had it on
the tablets we haven't had on the phone
save an infrared blaster now built in so
you can use this but I think users are
going to say well how's that better than
just using my remote which also is
infrared and or the set-top box and the
programming guide so the idea of watch
on is to be able to create rich content
through the electronic pro lectronimo so
you know whether you're in you know
based on postal code and profile and
carrier user provider you can
download what's currently on you can get
information that's richer than you would
through the programming guide I mean
does it does it integrate with services
like Netflix are there other services
coming yes and you know and that's the
beauty when you think about it what is
the modern kind of consumption process
is it and it's not defined just probably
any longer by just what you're getting
through let's say a cable service it's
just find by Netflix and other providers
where the mobile device can be the hub
of that and then it can be projected on
a TV or other devices so thinking about
that what is the cutter modern remote
look like and it looks like an
aggregator for for being able to check
out a marketplace for these kinds of
services you know what's available what
prices and that sort of thing a watch on
is intended to facilitate that very very
cool so I want to finish up with showing
a couple of the accessories that Samsung
has coming for the s4 so we saw the
windowed case which saves screen power
because it only has to turn on a little
bit at a time if you want show me show
me this one and this one this one most
importantly well you know I mean people
like different colors and even though we
have will have a black and a white
version of the phone you know from a
battery cover point of view that lots of
dollars just in time for spring later or
that is your greens or banks your blues
which everybody likes to do we also have
a wireless charging option though
because we know that you know folks have
said it would be just convenient Babel I
the device down so on the back as an
option you can get this wireless
charging covered slightly different it
replaces the battery cover that comes
standard with the device you place that
on you plug this wireless charging mat
in lay the device down and a charges so
nice and easy I think that's pretty much
it thank you so much Ken this has been
absolutely fantastic so you guys are
doing much more than just putting a
faster processor in I think as the point
you're trying to make here and I'd love
to do this again sometime maybe when the
s5 comes out or whatever else the case
may be thank you for the opportunity
really appreciate it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
