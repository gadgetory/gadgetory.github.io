accessory offered by just a few
companies that let you top up the juice
in your phone when you were on the go
now a commodity I mean seriously who and
their dog doesn't have one of these with
their branding on it so dbrand offered
to sponsor an investigation by us into
whether there is a difference between
name-brand battery banks and well less
name-brand battery banks
d brands custom configurator lets you
pick out exactly the skin you want for
your device even if you have frankly
awful taste check out the link in the
video description to learn more like any
commodity category where there's massive
competition there's a huge variety of
solutions that brands cook up to try to
differentiate their battery unit from
all the others some of it is purely
aesthetic rhinestones cool printed
graphics and the like but there are also
some additional features ranging from
kind of neat to very smart that you can
watch for battery charge status
indicators that range from a series of
LEDs to a full-on LCD display onboard
flashlights ruggedized or even
water-resistant housings built-in solar
cells for charging the bank itself more
numerous more powerful or more versatile
outputs you can get ones that start your
car and we have some with five twelve or
nineteen will output for laptop or
camera equipment charging and another
one with an AC wall style plug and more
ergonomic form factors like the
ever-popular cases popularized by Mophie
that have battery banks built into them
but we are keeping the scope of today's
video fairly narrow and we won't be
comparing any of that stuff we're going
to focus instead on the main factor that
consumers consider when comparing one
battery bank to another the capacity
expressed in milliamp hours or mAh of
the bank this is what tells you since
the unit of measurement here is the same
as the battery capacity of your device
how many charges or partial charges you
can expect out of a given bank before
you need to top it up but how honest our
manufacturers about this sort of thing
well that's where debrand
this video sponsor comes in to find out
they provided us with six identical
iphone SES complete with their high
quality vinyl skins of course and a
budget to go shopping for battery banks
so it was off to Amazon I went I wanted
representatives from the main brands
that our viewers are buying so I sent
out a tweet
asking for suggestions and I ended up
settling on anchor Mophie Shiro Aki
zalmi and the cheapest no-name one that
I could possibly find which ended up
taking so long to ship here from China
it delayed production of this video by a
few weeks then it was a matter of
deciding on a capacity that would be
relatively easy to test
so no 20,000 milliamp hour behemoths
that would require 10 full cycles but
not so small that we wouldn't be able to
differentiate between the margin of
error of our experiment and a
significantly lower real-world capacity
while also being available across all
these different brands and that ended up
being a pretty tall order I settled on a
cheero grip to rated at 5200 milliamp
hours an anchor second-generation
Astro rated at 6,400 milliamp hours and
Aki lipstick style rated at 5,000
milliamp hours a multi Powerstation duo
rated at 6,000 milliamp hours a sami
silver power bank rated at 5,000
milliamp hours and finally this gem from
Allegiant I think they were trying to
spell elegant in all caps that is rated
at 5600 milliamp hours I know that
they're not all the same but we can
factor in the different advertised
capacities when we interpret our results
higher capacity banks should last
proportionally longer than the lower
capacity ones so let's introduce our
testing methodology before beginning all
phones were drained and the battery
banks were charged we then plugged in
all the phones with the camera running
to monitor the experiment once all the
phones were charged that run was
finished the phones were unplugged then
left with their flashlights running to
drain their batteries for the next round
and after repeating this a few times
there are a couple of interesting
results to report so these are the raw
numbers showing how many recharge cycles
each battery managed on the iPhone se
some of this is as expected
talk to your brand's like Mophie deliver
the goods if you're willing to pay for
them and second-tier brands are almost
as good
but beware no name our cheapo one didn't
even manage to meet our expectations
that it would be a bit worse than a
brand name one it didn't charge the
iPhone se a single time I mean at this
point I feel like I should be glad it
didn't light on fire
now here are the same measurements
presented slightly differently by using
the strongest performer as a baseline we
can actually adjust all the others to
see what their relative real capacity is
versus their advertized capacity and
then here are the numbers presented a
third different way now we're looking at
the actual amount of phone charging that
you get per dollar for these solutions
using us prices at the time of editing
together this video pretty neat huh now
there are some additional considerations
the keen-eyed among you have probably
noticed that given the iPhone se s
meagre battery size none of these
chargers seem to be delivering the
manufacturers claims but that ignores
that the iPhone se s are actually on and
operating while the experiment is
running we preferred this approach as it
allowed us to avoid interacting with the
phones during the test varying screen on
time would be quite damaging to our
results which leads us then to the
conclusion while this investigation
isn't the be-all and end-all of battery
bank quality assessment I mean we didn't
discharge and recharge each of them 500
times or test across 10 different iPhone
se s per model of battery bank or
anything like that I'd consider it good
enough to be you know plus or minus
let's say five to ten percent to tell us
what sort of the best initial quality is
if we're to make a comparison to the
automotive industry so if nothing else
it gives us a look into the measurement
and validation practices of these
particular brands on these fairly
similar products and what we learn then
is that if you're buying from a
reputable brand it's hard to go very
wrong but if something seems too good to
be true like this one it probably is
speaking of too-good-to-be-true dbrand
lets you visualize what your phone is
going to look like with one of their
high quality of vinyl skins before you
have to place an order you select your
device whether it's a phone or they've
even got mac books and pc laptops
including Dells XPS line on there or a
game controller or a game console and
then you pick out all the different
surfaces and you can mix and match
different skins whether you want
something that you know doesn't clash
and actually looks good together or
whether you want something completely
out to lunch like that iPhone se that we
showed off at the beginning of the video
their prices are reasonable they ship
worldwide and they're just generally
good guys we've been working with them
for a long time so if you're interested
in checking out Adi brand skin all you
got to do is hit that link in the video
description and skin up your device it
looks better and protects it from
incidental scrapes and scratches at the
same time so thanks for watching guys if
