honestly there's a lot of different
benchmarks you can run to test an SSD
but I'm going to talk more in terms of
in general theory and I'm just going to
show you a quick crystal disk mark as
well as one benchmark that may not be
interesting to you but I personally find
it interesting so first of all we've got
our little crystal disk mark gruhn so
you can see that these specs are pretty
much ridiculous you're looking at reeds
of over 600 megabytes per second and
this is for what is in for all intents
and purposes for SSDs strapped together
so come have a look at the card itself
so you've got 16 tips person force
controller here and then you've got a
PCI Express 2 PCI bridge you've got a
PCI RAID controller here so we're
running all 4 drives in raid 0 remember
you can configure them in whatever RAID
config that you want that's totally up
to you and so yeah I've left them in
raid 0 it comes pre done in raid 0
though so here I'm going to actually
shut down the computer really quick so
we're installing up the one of two
actually windows updates install really
fast that's one of the things I really
like about the Revo drive because I had
to set up a new Windows setup in order
to show you guys a fresh install
actually here that stay focused on this
though because I'm going to show you
guys the boot up time there I press the
button now and yeah so it I really
appreciate when things just turn it
install really quickly so that's been
really nice about the Revo drive now I
want to talk while we're waiting for the
system to boot up about some of the
theoretical limitations of something
like a Revo drive so first of all Revo
drive does not support trim I get a lot
of questions about this and trim is not
supported in RAID period that means
whether we're talking raid on a PCIe
card whether we're talking about raid on
multiple SATA drives that are plugged
into a motherboard or a third party raid
card whatever it is no trim period so
what that means is that the Revo drive
relies on its idle garbage collection in
order to make sure that the SSD stays
performing in an optimal state and look
at that as
soon as I boot it in I had it launching
Word PowerPoint and Excel it didn't even
hesitate so that is in addition to going
back and checking out my original hard
drive vs SSD episode on NCIX tech tips
which you should go check out that is
just the demonstration that I want to
show you guys for how snappy an SSD
makes everything you do in fact why
don't we show you guys a couple other
ones Windows Media Center takes forever
to launch I think we can all agree about
that boom done
Windows Media Center can take like
multiple steamboats to launch on a hard
drive it can even take a steamboat or
steamboat and a half to launch on an SSD
but on something like the Revo drive
it's just ridiculous so here you know
what stay stay tuned with me here I'm
going to go ahead and start adding a
bunch of random stuff to the startup
folder so let's put Windows Media Player
in there let's put Internet Explorer in
there let's just add like a whole bunch
of like random stupid stuff to it so how
about the see I don't have a whole lot
installed on here right now I apologize
for that guys I wish I had sort of more
so why don't we just sort of grab some
more random dumb stuff and throw it in
in the startup folder here let me do
this off camera then and I'll come back
when I'm ready so for the sake of being
able to reproduce this from home we've
stuck with mostly applications that
almost anyone should have installed on
their computer so I'm going to go ahead
and press ENTER and we are are we done
already with that it I was expecting to
have like some kind of a time period
that you can actually measure but
there's nothing it's just done by the
time we hit the desk we don't even see
the desktop it's just done so we
launched the calculator Excel Internet
Explorer paint PowerPoint sound recorder
Windows Media Center Windows Media
Player as well as Microsoft Word we
launched it all and it's done just like
that so that's how fast the Revo drive
is would I recommend that you get one
definitely so yeah that's pretty easy
also it has these cool LEDs check it out
so if I do anything on the on the hard
drive it actually like it kind of
reminds me of an airplane because it has
like lights on each wing so you
you can actually see the the activity
LEDs for these two SSDs here and then
you can see the activity LEDs for the
two SSDs that are built into the bottom
PCB over here so anytime you do anything
whether yes so here I'm kind of like
accessing things you can see they all
kind of flash and it looks really cool
in the dark when your systems well in
the dark so thanks for checking out
Linus tech tips don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and don't
forget to check out the OCZ Revo drive
x2 in all of its wicked performance
glory well crazy Russian thinks it looks
more like a spaceship in an airplane but
you know what they say about people who
are crazy they think they see spaceships
so hey man I like spaceships and lasers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
