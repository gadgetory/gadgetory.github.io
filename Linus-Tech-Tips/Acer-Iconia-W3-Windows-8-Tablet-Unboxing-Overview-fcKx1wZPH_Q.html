to learn more so what was missing on
Windows 8 or Windows RT devices compared
to Android devices so you could make an
argument for quite a few things but I
would say that one of the big ones was
variety early on when Microsoft released
Windows 8 and Windows RT they only had a
specification for how the operating
system was supposed to work for down to
a 10 inch tablet so that's why you saw
so many devices in that size range the
way that the menus were designed to work
the way multitasking was designed to
work wasn't made for smaller tablets
that's all changed as of around Computex
this year and Acer's first response to
this need for smaller Windows devices is
the w3 tablet so we're going to go ahead
and fire this bad boy up and see what we
think of it now like some of my
unboxings lately you can see that the
packaging has been removed also the
device might look like it's been used
for a bit because I have done that thing
so this is the packaging that you would
normally find on it here is the do not
discard thing with your product key
which I'm of course covering up for you
know safety and then we've also got a
QuickStart guide a power adapter and see
if I can get this out of the yeah there
we go I don't have broken a little bit
and the piece that that goes into so
this allows Acer to easily adapt for
different regions so power adapters
pretty much what you'd expect and I
think that's pretty much it in terms of
accessories so physically the device
shouldn't be too surprising if you've
seen a tablet in the last five years or
so what can I say it's pretty thin okay
so here's an HTC One for comparison not
by any stretch of the matte imagination
as thin as something like an iPad Mini
but it's a bit of a different device
it's meant to be more of a Productivity
device as opposed to the iPad Mini feels
more like an entertainment you know
mobile gaming platform or mobile media
consumption platform right here is where
you'll see it
at HTC one in terms of screen size so
that's a five-inch screen compared to an
8-inch screen up on the top of the
device we don't find anything
particularly surprising a volume rocker
as well as a microSD expansion slot it
should be noted that Google's moving
away from micro sd Apple has never
really had any support for it but that
doesn't seem to be the case with Windows
devices at least at this point in time
on the right-hand edge we find that this
is a bit of an odd one so there's two
speakers two stereo speakers here and
here and then we've also got power in as
well as a headphone microphone combo
jack on the back of the unit we find in
a shiny Acer logo just kind of a a
pretty slick but it has a bit of grip to
it so it's not completely glossy and
slippery so a bit of a slick back as
well as an InTown side sticker and a
Windows 8 sticker we also find a 2
megapixel webcam both here and on the
front here so this is um sort of sort of
weird because you look at the Acer logo
on the back here and it looks like okay
this is an intended to be used as
landscape device there's an Acer logo
there but then the windows button is
here so that looks more like a portrait
device and then the stereo speakers are
here in here which makes it look more
like it's intended to be used in
portrait mode as well and then your
webcam is up there so maybe Acer was
kind of hedging their bets going ok well
maybe some people will use it landscape
some people use it portrait and we're
not going to put them into a box in
terms of how they intend to use it but
it gives you some challenges because for
me for particularly when I'm consuming
media I would hold it in landscape mode
DAW and both of my stereo speakers are
now on the right so I lose stereo which
is sort of the point of putting two
speakers on one of these devices and
then if I was doing something like
webcamming with with a relative I don't
know maybe I would maybe I would hold it
like this and then I can sort of thumb
type so I guess I understand the
orientation of the webcam up there but
just the whole thing still feels a
little bit a little bit a little bit
weird to me
Acer sent along a couple of accessories
for us to check out while we were
spending some time with the w3 so this
one right here is a case protective case
I think I joked about this on Twitter
when I
originally got the shipment because I
had just dropped my HTC one and I was
like really you dropped one phone and
every manufacturer sends you a
protective case for the samples that
they lend you geez anyway so it fits in
here pretty pretty easily actually it's
similar to the W 700 that I'm using
right now over here to display my notes
for this particular unboxing so all it
does is there's a spot for the webcam
right there it clips into the plastic
shell piece and then I could do a couple
of options in terms of whether you want
to just close it it's got kind of a
pleather II feel to it overall so you
can do that or you can prop it up this
way for more like sitting and typing
there we go it looks a little something
like that no I don't want to restart
right now I'm in the middle of unboxing
Windows 8 okay or you can put it all the
way down and that would be more like a
content consumption or or touch screen
sort of interface mode now I want to
talk specs as well so it has an atom's
e27 sixty two gigs of memory so it's a
1.5 gigahertz base 1.8 gigahertz boost
processor it's got 32 gigs or 64 gigs of
SSD storage so that's going to be e MMC
that's not going to be a full-blown SSD
but it's fast enough for the sort of
portable 8-inch touchscreen experience
they're quoting an eight hour battery
life uses wireless n as well as
Bluetooth 4.0 to communicate with
various things such as the keyboard
accessories so this is actually a pretty
neat little keyboard it is able to do a
couple of things pretty well so number
one is it's reasonably comfortable to
type on which you wouldn't expect for an
8-inch tablet keyboard however it's
quite a bit larger than the keyboard so
it's not as portable I think it takes
away from the mobility of the device a
little bit but what's good about it is
the fact that because the device comes
with office home and student which i
think is a really really cool add-on it
turns it into something that's more than
just a way to watch movies on the plane
but something that you can actually get
a little bit of work done on compared to
most tablets particularly in this size
range
it actually clips on to the tablet
itself just like this there we go so
here I'll show you guys how this works
so the the to speak
down there that might be part of the
reason for the design there go there and
then it clips into place so the screen
itself is actually protected and then
you can carry around the whole thing
like this maybe stuff it into a bag or
whatever else but the weight and size
starts to become more like something
like a netbook class product as opposed
to as opposed to something like a tablet
with a wireless keyboard that goes with
it now I've made it this far in without
criticizing it yet but I have to do it
unfortunately the w3 uses a TN panel and
particularly in something like a mobile
device where you're out and about and
you can't necessarily guarantee that
you're going to be viewing it from the
optimal angle I do find that to be a bit
of a deficiency in this product so I'll
give you guys some idea of what the
viewing angles are like here I'm just
going to go over there so you can see
that we start to see at probably around
60 degrees we start to get inverted
colors sideways and then when we tilt up
and down yeah we definitely see those
those characteristics of TN panels
really shine through with that said it
should be noted that IPS panels are more
expensive so it's it's a give or take do
you want a tablet that's small and
portable and reasonably powerful comes
with office or would you rather it had a
nicer screen and you'll get your own
copy of office ultimately it's up to you
however there aren't really that many
options out there comparable to the w7
or the w3 right now so yeah there you go
