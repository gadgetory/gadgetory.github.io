Singapore with some of my wife's
relatives it's absolutely beautiful
we're talking like talking parrot teak
wood stairs just gorgeous interior
actually it was designed by the owner
and then built on this lot here in
Singapore everything about it is just
amazing and beautiful except for one
thing the Wi-Fi is awful I was getting
disconnections all over the place I was
getting slow toes I couldn't even send
hangouts messages half the time so being
me I was like okay so what's your Wi-Fi
solution what's wrong with your internet
because the speed test is fine it's 50
down about 8 up which should be plenty
for all of that stuff and he shows it to
me and I go oh ok so these guys are
using the ISP provided modem switch
router access point combo unit the
structure of this place is pure like
foot thick concrete and then they've got
a repeater down on the landing for the
second story that is supposed to provide
better coverage downstairs awful
solution so it's time for us to figure
out some kind of a networking home
makeover while we're staying here
what the crap am i doing back here
it's like I traveled through time to
tell you guys live Intel's new 750
series SSDs utilized the envy any
standard providing speeds never seen
before on consumer storage drives click
anywhere to learn more all right so
we're here at the famous inland square
where I'll be trying to find some better
wireless gear and just kind of generally
checking it out because I've heard a lot
of stuff about this place number one is
that it's an awesome place to find
pretty much anything electronics and
computer yeah number two is that it's a
great place to get scammed with everyone
giving different sorts of advice but
apparently Mobil 22 Pte limited and
gadget terminal Pte limited have had a
fair number of complaints as of the last
period ear so I should watch out for
those guys important notice yeah let's
head inside they have everything here
that last place had like an entire rack
of machetes
I wish they'd had this place when we
lost our microphone in Taipei I wonder
if I need one of these probably not I
think there's five or six stories I got
all kinds of fun stuff on the second
floor our see stuff some more computery
type stuff and ladders lots of ladders
I guess if it's an entire I mean
Singapore's about eight million people
so you're gonna have a third of the
population of Canada all within driving
distance to this place would you need to
online stores for whoa look at this it's
like a sea of Technology okay so I think
we found our first networking gear shop
hello
I am looking for some wireless stuff
lunch okay do you know what time maybe
10 minutes 20 minutes about 30 minutes
about 20 minutes all right I will come
back in 20 minutes okay hi I yeah I'm
actually looking for let's see I think
it would be about a 30-foot Ethernet
cable white oh you only have bulk for
white but so the third floor looks like
the place to be for getting the
networking stuff we need this is her
shop where I was told to ask them about
the fasteners and and white cables oh
forget everything I need a 10 meter
white Ethernet cable bill any case they
were only cat set okay how much is that
then it's a little overkill oh nice it's
like a flat 1/2 that's actually kind of
Awesome $20 is a lot for a 10 meter
Ethernet cable though okay so another
question for you do you have any
fasteners like adhesive it's like sticky
fasteners maybe you can MIT if this fits
I will buy this steel yep still good
okay so I need let's say three packs of
that this one left one last one you
already made the sale and now you don't
have enough of them okay well I got okay
how many are there in here oops I
spilled them all but 15 okay
okay I'll make it work so I want this in
this
28 bucks for our Ethernet cable and our
fasteners all right so let's head up to
the fourth floor maybe we can find some
more wireless stuff there before we head
back to the shop on the third floor Wow
three laptop stores right in a row
we're laptop stores laptop stores Matt
I'm not shopping for a laptop all right
well these guys are more like my speed I
need a 128 gig SSD and I need a too big
stick of ddr2 99 for my SSD and 46 from
Iran I think I can do better on the SSD
but I'm not sure about the round thank
you
two gigs stick of ddr2 $55 55 to be
really cheap yeah how about the 128 gig
SSD what did you don't find 105 memory
world 58 how about the SSD 139 looks
like we're back to the first store
you guys win everyone else's price sucks
sucks
you dare to 800 perfect dad come all the
way here to buy computer hardware right
you want to be in the video
145 alright everyone else gave me really
bad prices maybe because I'm late we've
got our ramen SSD but we still need our
networking stock
like all of these laptops are broken why
do you keep them just in case oh good
yeah this one does include both the PIO
e adapter and the unit so in fact I
won't even need a POV switch that's
excellent
another option would just be to get like
a Nighthawk x6 and call it a day repeat
these yeah I don't want to use a
repeater 529 these things are like 300
bucks where I'm from that's ridiculous
yeah I will have to I'll have to come
back no problem
okay another Network specialty looking
stores pitch bright 373 78 Wow
maybe this place has stuff at least it's
not a laptop store okay there's nothing
in there what's pricing on the AC 66 you
243 okay not bad so far you're the best
option right now
245 for an AC 66 you I'm gonna have to
know POV I have to get power to it
somehow this is ridiculous like I
promised your uncle one cable to the
pillar not like two cables to the pillar
so you know what I think we're gonna do
oh I don't like this at all but we're
gonna go get one AP Pro and we're going
to hope that the coverage is good enough
from right in the center and if it's not
then we're gonna need another one
whatever they have there I want to buy
it
the first study cafe this place is like
a maze I can't even find the stores we
were shopping at before AP pro 389 AP
pro 408 ah we just saved twenty bucks do
you guys have unify AP pros in stock
okay well I don't have much more time to
shop so I don't think we have a choice
yep let's do it well overall I'm not
happy about it but at least they waived
the 3% stupid credit card surcharge and
after I asked what three times alright
so we're back
to unpack our spoils and get started
here so there's actually two projects
because there was some complaining about
the desktop computer upstairs so for
that we need an SSD and a stick of
memory so we've got that and then for
the Wi-Fi we need our new unify AP pro
our cat seven cable and then these cable
management tabs here so let's get
started shall we
this is so not a cat seven cable well I
guess it could be cat 6 what's the
easiest way
well this door gets to be open a crack
from now on is that gonna be a problem
that my friend is how it is gonna be to
get good internet okay like right down
here so we get a nice clean line okay so
I'm not sure about ideal locations part
of the problem is this structure is all
concrete concrete concrete it doesn't
look like I'm gonna have a choice so
either I think I'm gonna do that pillar
on the second floor or I'm gonna run it
to mount on this thing what I might ask
is what's the priority because if the
priority is the downstairs and I might
be better off to go here that's what you
get for having bad Wi-Fi so one of the
reasons we had to spend so much on our
access point was POA power over ethernet
so that I don't have to run those two
wires and what I like about the ubiquity
is anyway is that they come with an
injector in case you don't have a POS
which do these two-pronged ones work
here oh you have an adapter oh handy all
right did not count on that so we might
need to use some kind of adhesive
backing and I didn't
get any extra I have yeah I also need to
steal one here ethernet cables okay now
let's go plug this guy oh I'm sweating
so much see if we got power I might have
to go switch those things around I
always get it wrong any late oh there it
goes alright now we got to get the
console fired up okay so to configure
the thing we need to install the
ubiquity controller software so let's
fire up this ancient dell optiplex 760
this is actually the computer I'll be
upgrading and get it set up once we've
got the controller set up it doesn't
actually ever need to interact with the
controller so I'm not worried about that
we just need to get it set up the first
time
who says text don't you know work out
no wonder they want this computer
upgraded I can't even do anything in an
internet browser even the mouse movement
is slow oh my goodness this computer
needs more than just a new SSD and some
ran the most up-to-date circuits like ie
8 or something
alright so per the usual the equity
software super easy to get set up so all
we've got to do now is manually set up
our channels manually set up our widths
during the setup wizard I was able to
set up the SSID and everything so what's
left now then is to have a look at the
surrounding area and you can see that
this is why I thought it was so
important to have 5 gigahertz because
actually from the from the outside from
the backyard there's a bunch of stuff in
here so stuff on Channel six seven there
old Wi-Fi was on Channel One actually
both the axe the repeater and the
original access point we're on one so
they're just talking over each other
but on five gigahertz basically empty so
actually actually the only thing we can
see right now is the one that I just put
in so we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna play around with positioning a
little bit we're gonna make sure that
from everywhere within the house we've
got a decent signal then we're gonna go
ahead and set this baby up all right so
here in the back corner we can see
there's a couple on Channel 36 from this
neighbor but our strength is still not
that bad on five gigahertz naturally
this floor is all very good with the
access point right in the middle even
five gigahertz can punch through you
know one concrete wall okay actually
should be workable all right so wait at
the back is actually quite good so we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna try
actually running some speed tests in
this position to see how it goes
here at the back you can see what I was
talking about with 2.4 gigahertz being
completely congested and five gigahertz
basically being our best bet to not be
completely interfering with absolutely
everything else yeah you won't be
facetiming back here Russian girls so
now that we've determined the location
we want I'm just gonna throw a little
sticky note on here that has the admin
password and all that good stuff
actually I'm gonna put it on the
mounting plate then I have double-sided
adhesive that's got two different kinds
so I'm gonna hedge my bets and I'm gonna
use half of each well what I wanted to
do to have it on the bottom stare nope
okay that's what gotta apply pressure
about 30 seconds okay
oh I do want to leave this like some
kind of a knot here actually if the
adhesive fails I don't want it to come
crashing to the ground so this is where
my cable management tabs from upstairs
come in straight lines are good all
right how many jobs do I have left
oh nine so that is nine feet okay so
we're gonna go every foot
okay so I think we're done now our
connectivity up here is the only place
in the house where it's really not as
consistent as I'd like not as good as
I'd like but I think we found a solution
because it's only very rarely that
someone is going to be using something
like a phone up here this is actually
the worst performing device in the house
for Wi-Fi that laptop over there that
old laptop gets 40 megabit from the
position on this desk right here on our
range network so that's what we ended up
doing we made two SSIDs speed and range
speed can saturate the 100 megabit
connection that we have here at this
location from anywhere downstairs pretty
much and then range is able to even on
our worst case scenario device give us
about you know five to ten megabit up
here not too shabby
then what we did was we reconfigured the
existing access point as more of a
failover so we called this one attic and
so if range on a particular device is
not working well up here you can connect
directly to that one then we left the
range extender downstairs and with a
little bit of repositioning I'm able to
get 20 megabit at the very bottom floor
with that one but we're just gonna leave
that unplugged unless our ubiquity
access point fails or something like
that so now we have not only better
speeds pretty much throughout the house
but we also have a failover system in
the event that you know the access point
dies or something like that so not too
shabby
is it the ideal solution no what I
wanted was a 24/7 controller running and
two access points one at the top one at
the bottom then I think I could get
anywhere from 50 to 100 megabit anywhere
on the property that would be great we
weren't able to do that because you know
how things are so this is not a bad
solution overall what madness is this
I'm back in the studio
