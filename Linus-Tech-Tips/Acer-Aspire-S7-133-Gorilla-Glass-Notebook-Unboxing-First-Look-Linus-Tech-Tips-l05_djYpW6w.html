the aspire s7 13.3 inch from Acer
now I've already had a look at their 11
inch model which has an aluminum
actually gorgeous aluminum finish on the
top of it but this is like sort of if if
the aspire s7 11 inch is sexy then this
is like I don't know it sort of I don't
I don't know what word to use for it
anymore because this is the version that
has its 13.3 inch
it has Gorilla Glass on the top it's
1080p so it's full HD in a 13 inch form
factor which is pretty good pixel
density especially for a notebook
because of the distance you're gonna be
sitting from it and let's get started
here I guess so the first thing you find
is verb ending makin Matheny Drive
Loused Network so that's probably German
accessing a wireless network
so they've got a QuickStart guide for
that as well as showing you a couple
cool things about the notebook itself
how do I access charms how do I get to
start all that good stuff
actually there's an episode of NCIS tech
tips that you can check out so the the
Start menu thing reminded me of this but
if you want to know how to add the Start
menu to Windows 8 it's not a bad idea
lots of people do it alright included
power brick so you can already tell that
this is a premium machine just because
of the way the power brick is white so
they're they're doing those extra little
things that set it apart from from other
notebooks it's also a very small power
brick so I'll do the obligatory phone
size comparison so this is an HTC 8x
Windows Phone there you go so you can
see the thickness of the brick versus
the phone let's go ahead and get that
away the same thing Packaging is very
very sleek and elegant as well there's
the notebook itself there's also that
comes with a carrying sleeve mmm very
nice way this leather wow that's awesome
velcro would have preferred to see a
magnet but inside is kind of a micro
fiber II feeling material
and there you go closes like that you
got a nice little acer logo on there
it's actually that's I mean it's pretty
I shouldn't call it velcro I should call
it you know stick and whatever it's
called
but velcro's velcro as a trademark I'm
not supposed to call it that all right
next up we've got the Acer Oh so thin oh
love it really excited about this okay
but first but first the boring things so
in here we've got him how do I access
charms again as well as a QuickStart
guide all right
then we've got some warranty information
so it has a one-year parts and labor
warranty software support oh they can do
software support for 90 days that's kind
of nice actually okay and more
accessories all the compartments comes
with a mouse okay so that's a wireless
mouse uses two triple A batteries also
comes with what's in here Oh what
doctors all right I do like to see stuff
like this included it actually kind of
drives me crazy when manufacturers are
gonna go and use a proprietary connector
for something at least have the decency
to include the adapter that you need so
that you can get the functionality that
your notebook is supposed to have so if
you're gonna have like a weird VGA
adapter then go ahead and give me one so
that I saw that I actually have it all
right so the thinness of this machine is
extremely impressive especially given
that it is a touchscreen notebook so
that adds some width to it
just right off the top because that
extra interface layer is there and does
take up space holy crap it's thin and I
mean you can see the tooling on it is
immaculate there's absolutely no gap
whatsoever between actually okay well
there's a gap but it's because there's a
paper thing in there so if I go ahead
and take that out oh wow that's like I
think this is paper but it's probably
the most expensive paper I've ever
encountered okay so there you go so
there's no gap whatsoever in the tooling
on the notebook itself everything is
even this is one of the things that you
can check for and how you can tell a
premium notebook from a less
Premium notebook it's it takes a lot
more time and a lot more effort and much
tighter manufacturing tolerances to do
something like that
now I'm gonna do a flex test with this
thing and you guys are gonna like this
too so watch this you can see the amount
of flex there is to this notebook in
spite of how thin it is part of that is
due to V here we go
double-sided Gorilla Glass on the
display itself so there's a gorilla
glass panel here Gorilla Glass 2 rather
with a white with just with like a white
a white piece behind it so you've also
got sort of a shiny silver Acer logo
there grow the glass here and then
Gorilla Glass 2 again here on the inside
so it means that you've got that sort of
that buttery smooth feel that you get
with Gorilla Glass it also means that
the notebook itself is going to be more
durable than notebooks that are not
using Gorilla Glass the panel is very
nice the panel is I don't think the
brightness is even all the way up either
so let's go have a look there settings
brightness cranked it up yeah there we
go so the panel is presumably IPS
whatever it is it's not TN viewing
angles are outstanding so I'm gonna let
Diesel have a quick look at what the
colors look like straight on you got
that got that okay now we're gonna go
ahead oh oh oh how far does it go all
the way down 180 degrees so if you want
to lay this flat whether it's to work on
it from one side while you're showing
something what you're working on from
the other side or whether it's to carry
around and use it more like more like a
tablet so I'll show you that after but
okay now let's have a look at the
viewing angles from the side that do
that do that do that do that Oh how's
that color distortion over there Diesel
do you see anything yeah I'm getting me
I'm getting the headshake looks
absolutely beautiful
so all that goes more than 180 degrees
check this out so it goes all the way
down to all the way back here meaning
that you can actually kind of use it
like a tablet if you wanted to and
what's great about this one and the 11
inch model this is something I really
liked about the 11 inch is that it's
light enough that you can comfortably
use it with one hand because of the
aluminum construction in spite of the
glass up here so remember guys an
ultrabook label only applies to
notebooks that meet the requirements in
terms of battery life
thickness weight as well as security
features and a number of other things
from Intel they also have to have a
certain level of performance so we're
gonna go ahead and do a quick sleep test
here so we'll shut her down and ready
did it wake up there we go so they have
to have a certain level of performance
in terms of sleep and in spite of the
two pieces of glass up here it still is
well within that weight requirement and
it is extremely light the keyboard
itself uses an L backlight so it's light
sensing which means it's only gonna turn
on at a brightness level that is
actually needed so I'm gonna go ahead
I'm gonna turn it on manually now if I
can find the hotkey to do that which I
am having a little bit of trouble with
here function oh is it on oh it's on oh
oh that looks so cool okay lights off
guys check this out
there we go so it's got a bit of a blue
hue to it can you see that diesel he's
given me the somewhat gesture how about
now now we got it absolutely beautiful
so function keys can be used to increase
the brightness or decrease the
brightness so you've got it looks like
not that many brightness levels just two
brightness levels but it's either super
dim which is like this for us-- in a
very very dark environment where you
don't want it to be overpowering or you
can brighten it up and that is a very
unique looking backlight so you actually
can't see much around the outside of the
chiclet keys like you normally would but
it shows through not only on one color
but also the blue color keys as sort of
a subdued bluey kind of light looks very
very very beautiful so there's a shot of
the notebook before I turn the lights
back on ready guys and a321 lights back
up thank you
alright now I haven't even talked about
specs at all and I actually I wrote them
down on something but I forget so it's a
3517 u which is i 1.9 gigahertz core i7
and it's got 4 gigs of ram a 256 gig SSD
in this particular model here Wireless
and 4 cell polymer battery polymer
battery and then in terms of i/o we've
got power here as
well as HDMI here as well as a headphone
microphone jack here power button here
all right there speakers stereo speakers
on this guy and so nothing on the front
whatsoever then on this side are you
catching all this you got all this in
focus yeah I'm getting the nod excellent
so we've got two USB 3.0 ports one of
them is charging capable so it just
means it can deliver more current we've
also got an SD card reader then on the
back very similarly to the other s7
we've got ventilation ports and finally
on the bottom we've got more ventilation
ports here and then we've also got those
there those two speakers that I pointed
out one of them when we were going
around the other side so you see the
bottom is actually kind of a plasticy
material here so that helps to do a
couple things number one is it saves on
the costs a little bit it's also makes
it more environmentally friendly to
manufacture I don't know if you guys
know this but the amount of wasted
material and the amount of environmental
impact on unibody shells is actually
higher than manufacturing notebooks and
layers so there's a little tidbit for
you it doesn't lose any of the rigidity
though so you can see even actually here
this is this is even better so without
the benefit of the Gorilla Glass this is
my rigidity test check that out yeah
you're gonna see some flex I'm also
putting a lot of pressure on it that's
about as much flexes you're gonna get
out of that chassis and part of that is
I'm gonna let diesel sort of try to
focus in here is see how thick of a
piece of aluminum they've used for this
single slab all across the top can you
see that so with my finger for
comparison that's what gives it the
build quality that's what makes a
notebook like this extremely expensive
to manufacture so we're gonna put this
down again I'm just gonna show you guys
those adapters so one of these adapters
is a USB LAN adapter so that's just four
if you want to I don't know plug in not
use Wireless because Wireless is not
that great and then this guy right here
is a VGA adapter that actually plugs
into that HDMI out port so that'll be
either micro HDMI out or VGA out
depending on what you want making this
suitable for professional use because
I've criticised I've criticized
notebooks for not including VGA
especially Ultra portables where they'd
be suitable for business
except that a lot of boardrooms only
have old VGA projectors and you're gonna
need something that's actually able to
plug in so having an analog output is an
important thing I think that pretty much
wraps it up other than that this is one
of the most I mean ok here I don't want
to give sort of you know too much too
much detail about anything but the
president of NCIX actually chose for his
own personal notebook and aspire s7 so
there you go you can have pretty much
whatever notebook he wants has touched
pretty much any notebook out there and
used it and he basically he sent out a
memo that went
this is the best notebook I've ever
owned so there you go and I'm inclined
to agree with them they're absolutely
gorgeous I mean even things like the
hinges check this out let's do another
flex test I don't usually do this one
but I'm gonna take the very top of this
notebook and ream on it can you see that
okay hinge is everything in
manufacturing notebooks the hinge is so
important that's it thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the s7 13-inch don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos
so I was Reebok Seng it and I that thing
just kind of fell open I was like who
the heck is this so apparently this one
comes with an extended battery pack so
this adds another 2,500 milliamp hour
battery pack and then all you do to
mount it to the bottom of the s7 they've
actually put a lot of thought into this
so it has like a nice rubber
non-scratching piece here that pretty
much covers the entire thing so you
basically go okay I mean put that kind
of yeah there we go
so it clips on to the back with a little
clip right there can you figure that do
though yeah just clips in there then
you've got a couple of rubber protected
screws here so that those also won't
scratch the bottom even if you put them
in wrong the first time so you just go
ahead and screw that on and then this is
a very fun I mean I've seen a lot of
different extended battery designs some
of which kind of stick out the back of
the notebook and some of which kind of
raised the notebook but this is very
functional I like this because it
doesn't interfere with any of the
cooling it doesn't look stupid
especially from this side okay from this
side it looks a little weird but it
doesn't look stupid and then it also
acts as kind of a notebook stand so now
you've got a slight angle to the
notebook so typing is still comfortable
and all of that good stuff that you
would expect except now you have an
extended battery so you just plug your
power adapter in here instead of here
and then that little a hole right there
that I paused on when I was doing the
initial video because I was a little
confused about goes like this so that's
just a stabilizer for the DCN pass
through from the battery pack itself
there you go and then it just tucks back
in there quite nicely so it's even
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
