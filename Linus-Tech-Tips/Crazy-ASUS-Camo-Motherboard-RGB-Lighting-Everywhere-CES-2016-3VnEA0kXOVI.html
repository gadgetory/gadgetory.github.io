will be checking out motherboards here
we've got a white one a multicolored one
and a small one let's go thank you to
Squarespace for bringing us to CES 2016
this year check out a link to them in
the video description down below so like
I said starting with the white one this
is the saber-tooth Zed 170 SS or sub
Ronco or whatever you want to call it it
looks pretty sick and that's kind of
honestly the biggest point here unlike a
lot of other sabertooths
it doesn't have the armor on the front
or the armor on the back or any of that
kind of stuff there's a minor rumor that
there might be the ability to buy those
as an add-on afterwards but that's
totally not a thing as of right now so
don't don't bank on that I think it
looks super cool in terms of headers and
plugins and all that kind of stuff it
has a boatload of fan headers I think
it's 11 in total there's one there's
four across the top three on the
right-hand side two three on the bottom
and then one in the middle of the board
for a grand total of enough fans to
literally take your entire computer off
the ground if you wipe your tired of
hoverboards you can have a hover
computer I don't know it's ridiculous on
the IO on the back there's a bank of
four USB 2.0 ports another USB 2.0 port
just to the right of that a BIOS reset
switch DisplayPort HDMI dual USB 3.0 a
gigabit ethernet port a USB 3.1 port a
USB type-c port and then a bank of audio
plugins next up we've got the
multicolored crazy shiny one which is
the Maximus 8 formula whose tagline is
see the light we'll figure out why in a
moment
first off they've got some cool stuff
like high performance water blocks
co-designed by EK water blocks under
these little rubbery grommets up here
and you're worried you don't have to use
those your computer will function just
great without them now in terms of i/o
on the back I want to cover this real
fast because it's absolutely insane they
have to buy two 802 11 AC mu-mimo so
multi-user mimo Wi-Fi through these two
antenna ports right here you've got a
CMOS clear you've got BIOS reset hdmi
displayport quad USB 3.0 Gigabit LAN USB
3.1 standard a connector or USB 3.1
type-c connector a ps2 port which while
some of you might think that's funny I
actually appreciate so
of whatever man two more USB 3.0 ports
and then a bank of audio ports now I
know I glossed over some things but the
main important thing about this is the
new lighting stuff so there's three
lighting zones there's one here when
we're in the middle and one up there
this area is not technically a lighting
zone it's always going to stay white
just so you guys know but another cool
thing is down at the bottom there's this
white little header which is going to
enable you to plug in a lighting strip
and then use their rog or a lighting
software to control that lighting strip
and all the RGB lighting on the board so
they're all in sync which is super cool
because you could then bridge off of
that lighting strip and make it even
longer or go all around the case or make
under lighting or whatever the heck you
want and everything's going to be in
sync and it's going to be nice and good
last Bend honestly maybe least we have
the Asus be 150 I pro gaming Wi-Fi or
aboard which would have maybe been
helpful if you've seen the follow build
considering it is ever so slightly
shorter in the heatsink Department and
that might have actually helped me
anyways this is basically just a cheaper
version of their currently available
current generation ITX boards which is
really good to see because ITX being a
value proposition is something that
should definitely stay a thing and kind
of wasn't for a little while there it
does have one funky feature which is
along the right-hand side of the board
just under the board or is it in the
board no it's under the board is RGB
stuff so just like we saw in the
previous board it has the ORA RGB
lighting system in terms of plugging in
fans you have three headers two that are
up and near the top right-hand ish kind
of corner one that is just above where
you'd plug in your expansion card in
terms of fancy features that it carries
over from more higher-end boards it does
have 2 by 2 MIMO AC Wi-Fi which is
pretty badass and an MDOT 2 slot which
is hidden behind the board it actually
kind of took me a sec to find that one
for IO you've got 2 USB 2.0 ports a ps2
port badass DVI optical HDMI USB type-c
Gigabit Ethernet 2 USB 3.0 ports that
Wi-Fi that we were talking about earlier
and a bang
of audio ports alright guys thanks for
checking out our video at the a su sweet
unsurprisingly Asus has a bunch of cool
new motherboard stuff coming soon thank
