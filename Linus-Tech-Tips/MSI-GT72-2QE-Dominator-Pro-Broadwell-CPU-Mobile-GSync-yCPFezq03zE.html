if MSI is to be believed another weapon
to save mankind I mean really MSI really
Wow for you the viewer I'm not
recommending that you go watch that
video although it is kind of hard to
look away from because if you're that
into cringe you guys should probably be
dropping a like on this video to let us
know if you're excited for the
conclusion of scrapyard wars 2 which is
coming this weekend with probably more
cringe than the msi promotional video
kingston kc 310 series business great
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them
let's start as always with specs because
a gaming laptop could have as many RGB
keyboards as it wants but if it can't
back it up with raw horsepower i'm not
going to recommend you buy it at its
heart the gt72 2 QE features an Intel
Core i7 5700 HQ yes that is a Broadwell
quad-core mobile CPU which means about a
10% improvement over the last generation
equivalent 4720 HQ 16 gigs of ddr3 L
memory and a gtx 980m graphics card the
best mobile GPU available and only a
stone's throw from a desktop GTX 970 in
terms of performance so lots of raw
horsepower under the hood looks good too
with two massive cooling fans a metric
but ton of heat pipes and expandability
galore with 4 + dot 2 SSD slots a tuna
1/2 inch drive slot and four dimm slots
available for upgraders to throw in up
to 4 8 gig sticks for a total of 32 gigs
I actually did try my 16 gig ddr3
modules in the bottom slots and while
the BIOS and Windows picked up forty
eight gigs of RAM which was sick
unfortunately Windows only reported 32
as usable so who knows if that support
will come in the future can you find in
64 gigs of RAM anyway
withdrawing to the out
the industrial design screams NSI with a
game Reeb lack and red color scheme the
screen backing is an aggressively
sculpted brushed aluminum with an
illuminated msi gt80 go the bottom has
tall rubber feet to allow ample airflow
through the red grills to the bottom
components oh and there's a sub Wofford
port down there as well a feature I
usually ignore but this laptop perhaps
actually more thanks to its large
internal volume in that massive speaker
on the inside actually has a
surprisingly potent sound system on the
back for IO we find power in for the
large included power brick gigabit
ethernet powered by a killer 2200
chipset to go along with the killer 1525
ac Wireless inside 2 mini DisplayPort
1.2 ports and an HDMI 1.4 a port for
easy display expansion on the right side
a blu-ray burner something I was
surprised was missing from the last 17
inch gaming notebook I checked out and
yet something I didn't touch throughout
my entire time with this one as well as
2 USB 3 ports then on the Left we've got
an SD card reader audio ports and 4 more
USB 3 ports but you might have noticed
what is why didn't you specifically say
USB 3.0 you always do that well they're
not two of them are USB 3.1 suckas that
means 10 gigabit Mac's rated speeds on
supported devices and you can check out
this video by clicking a little I in the
top right corner
to learn the full deets of USB 3.1
cracking open the device we'll start
with take that huge speaker girl with
the Dynaudio branding sounds
surprisingly good and then we'll follow
up with one of MSI's characteristically
solid steel series co-branded keyboards
the layout is standard in all the good
ways including a full number pad and
properly laid out arrow keys take notes
razor and in spite of its size msi has
done a good job of keeping overall flex
to a minimum but if I was to complain
about something I'm pretty sure that's
my job the keys have nice long travels
but are a little stiff at the top oh and
the function arrows function up and down
are
page up-and-down function left and right
our home and end everyone needs to quit
screwing this up especially when it's
the one damn thing about an otherwise
fully programmable macro compatible
keyboard that can't be changed the
touchpad is above average it tracks well
it's responsive it's a nice size and it
has the usual gesture support but this
is going to be a loved it or hated thing
it's seamlessly integrated into the
plastic wrist rest surface that's
separate from the rest of the metal
bottom under the keyboard personally I
like it because it'll keep crumbs out of
the edges of my trackpad but it does
make it harder to find the edge without
looking down and you can accidentally
run it a trackpad unexpectedly but
that's not even my biggest complaint
about the trackpad and there's always
one isn't there it's again a Fitness
related one the clicky buttons which I
like normally are quite difficult to
press down and I'd like to see that dial
back a bit now let's move on to the
screen like the Sager np97 73 that we
checked out recently the 1080 IPS
display in the GT 72 features and Vidya
g-sync
so unlike on the desktop notebook g-sync
works by having the GPU communicate
directly with the panel and instead of
Nvidia creating a scaler they're just
selecting g-sync certified panels
according to good behavior with variable
refresh solid color reproduction and
pixel responsiveness and there's a
couple of new features although they're
not limited to notebooks g-sync now
allows the behavior beyond the max panel
refresh rate to be modified to either
vsync or no vsync just like Andy's
freesync and it allows games to be run
in windowed full-screen mode now very
cool
but while variable refresh is undeniably
a better gaming experience than the
alternative it's not all rosy g-sync
doesn't work with Optimus right now so
if you want to use the onboard graphics
to save battery you'll actually need to
press this button which will prompt you
to reboot to switch bummer the good news
is that Maxwell's idle power consumption
is much better than previous mobile
graph
six cards so it's not as much of a kick
in the teeth as it would be so let's
talk temps and performance now then I
put it up against the np97 73 and the
razor blade 14 2015 to see how it fared
in I 264 CPU test the GT 72 walked away
with it this is going to be due to the
fact that it's literally over twice the
thickness of the only other one of these
notebooks also using a mobile CPU and
the last generation one at that GPU is a
bit of a tighter race here we have to
look not only at temperatures of our GTX
980 or nine seventy I'm graphics course
but also at GPU boost turbo speeds again
MSI is looking really good here with
solid boost clock speeds in Crysis 3 so
then what about the gaming experience
here MSI delivers almost the whole
package the gtx 980m rocks and the new
generation Broadwell cpu bridges the gap
nicely between last gen mobile flagships
and a full board desktop CPU but for
some reason while I really appreciate
the astonishing viewing angles of this
particular IPS panel and the non
oversaturated default color profile MSI
opted for a 60 Hertz panel while
competitors like Sager and a soos are
coming to the table with 75 Hertz panels
that from my experience can sometimes
even overclock to a hundred Hertz making
for a great mobile gaming experience my
gt72 managed a mere 70 Hertz once
overclocked which isn't to say that if
we look past the hilariously stupid
promotional video this isn't a
Buttkicker of a laptop I just have some
reservations at this kind of price I
expect no compromises and while I accept
that I am trading thin and light for
cool and quiet in this case I mean it's
gaming right now you can hardly hear the
thing I don't think the 128 gig SSD and
one terabyte hard drive are particularly
competitive with other $3,000 machines
the good news is at least there's a
variety of configs available on the
subject of variety Squarespace you pick
out the 10

card got like water cooling on it good
stuff go watch that or something else a
virus or someone else's video I guess

I'm wearing an Apple watch do I look
cooler yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
