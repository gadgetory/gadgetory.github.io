pizza heater computer what the hell is a
pizza heater computer well I'm going to
be building a cardboard prototype of it
so I've got this test bench here as you
guys can see I'm going to build a
computer onto this in actually this
configuration there will be cardboard
surrounding this on all sides and on the
bottom which will be duct-taped together
so that hopefully no heat can really
escape that way and then where did it go
this guy right here case side panel will
go on the top I'm going to chop it up a
little bit maybe get some holes in there
and stuff so that can vent heat out and
then the idea is you put a slice of
pizza on here and your computer keeps
your Pizza warm yeah
this is probably the most intelligent
video I've ever made on lines tech tips
I don't see anything wrong with this
computer or anything wrong with this
idea so come along with me
and let us build our pizza heater
prototype
coursera claims unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its new void

in the video description to learn more
first things first I have to build the
computer which is going to be a little
bit interesting because I'm going to use
this test bench here but the test bench
doesn't really hold it in like there's
no way to actually screw the board in so
I'm probably going to duct tape this
part of this shroud thing here to the
actual bench itself I've got a 6700 K in
here I'm just going to cool it with a
stock cooler so next up we've got the
graphics card these are 2 980 T is they
should have a pretty good amount of
thermal output I throw on an SLI bridge
here boom good to go so for now
everything is actually going to be
rather standard except for you know like
the cardboard case and stuff ok so I
need to align this power supply this way
because I want its thermal output going
up got my SSD unfortunately I can't just
have horrible cable management and have
that heat up my computer naturally
because as we saw in this video that's
apparently not enough ok so that's
actually kind of the system built right
there but it's still a lot more work to
do
ok so the graphics cards are too tall
which is not good now I wanted to use
nanos and Linus was like well the note
here has a lot more thermal output and
he's right what do I do
work hard board ok so I'm going to try
to chop this stuff up because this is
actually pretty strong cardboard it came
from super expensive glass stuff that
Brandon it ensures me will make things
look very pretty
there we go that works better stupid
crappy scissors so hopefully with this I
can just build an extension which will
be tall enough that my graphics cards
don't hit the ground I just cut a hole
in your tablecloth
I'm sorry Bannon so this is the
beginnings of my test bench extension
these four little boards will hopefully
enable me to make a box to make this
thing a little bit taller are they
strong enough I don't know whatever man
we'll figure it out okay maybe not the
most stable thing ever so I'm just
trying to make sure that this duct tape
is closing off any gaps that there could
be potentially someone that like
actually makes things out of cardboard
is going to see this and just cry
alright here we go
that actually might have worked or also
not that's also a possibility or it did
yeah yeah just barely but it did the
bench was kind of teetering on the box
so I cut up some more cardboard folded
it up and then duct taped it into the
side there so it has more of something
to rest on I also did that over here in
the exact same way so that each side has
more to rest on and then the back you
spin it around here for you I incurred
down with some duct tape so that it
should hold where it is so this so far
is the system I'm going to put this over
the video outs because I have two
graphics cards so I probably won't need
those
I'm just cleaning up this cardboard it's
like when you say back in the old days
when we're all hunters and gatherers and
you had to like clean your catch that's
basically what's going on
feel pretty pretty Game of Thrones II so
this is some grade-a cardboard right
here we only use triple a prime cut
cardboard here at Linus Media Group feel
nice that cut comes out that's how you
know it's good cardboard boys that way I
can remember when I'm looking at the
outside of the box
that's how everything's lined up there
then when I do this side I can draw it
differently go to this side I can draw
it differently again it's basically like
having window panels around the entire
thing but I would probably say better
okay so our our front is on I'm going to
install the back which has been labeled
with a please handle with care' fragile
thank you sign so that's pretty good
that's one side completed and moving on
it's important to try to cover up any
possible air leaks we can as we want
because we want all the hot air going up
our computer box has been completed as
you can see we need to move on to now is
I need to cut the holes through this so
the pizza can actually get some work so
Dremel time
if you can't tell I'm kind of rushing
all of a sudden it is currently the 19th
which is a Friday and the wind show was
supposed to start like a while ago right
there and is being held up by a few
things one of them being this build this
build is extremely important as you guys
know this is probably one of the most
important things that I've done in a
while um so it needs to get done this is
gonna be where I'm gonna run all of my
cables okay so now I've just got to
reach down in there turn it on that
didn't turn it on is that power cable
not plugged in or something
yes okay now I turn it on okay I took a
really long time but we are booted which
is good so I just need to get this going
get a benchmark running on it then we'll
get our heated pizza up on here and a
control going and then let them sit for
a while and see what happens okay so now
well I guess we need pizza to heat with
the computer so let's order some pizza
just a large simply cheese probably
original hand-tossed I think that'll be
best for thermals yeah okay great one
thing but do you know the thermal
properties of your crust by any chance
yeah okay noise thanks
but okay so pizzas on the way he was not
very helpful in terms of how well this
is going to work but like whatever I
guess can't get good customer service
everywhere let's do this
all right so we have our hopefully
thermally good pizza with original
hand-tossed crust which should go nicely
against the metal sheet and it's just
cheese so there isn't any weird toppings
on the top that we might have to heat up
so now what I'm going to do is I've got
these two cooking thermometers I'm going
to put one in each pizza one slice of
pizza I tried to get ones that were
pretty similar I think these guys are
pretty similar I'm going to take this
one and put it up on top of the computer
and leave that sit and then this one is
just going to sit on the edge of the
table over here far enough away that it
shouldn't be affected so this slice is
running at about sixteen point four
degrees Celsius they're both about
sixteen point four degrees and then
we'll see if we can get the temperature
to increase by running some benchmarks
here okay so I 264 is running on the CPU
like I just heard of the CPU fan kick up
a little bit that's good yeah I can feel
more air coming out of there now I'm
going to run heav'n fullscreen there we
go so we will check back in a little
while probably after the weigh-in show
and see how hot these pizza slices are
this is the coolest thing ever
you should try some eggs haha okay I
don't think it's hot enough for that yet
but yeah so just as an update guys that
pizza down there the control pizza is
currently at 16 degrees Celsius and this
one up here is that a solid 26 so
basically the concept will work it's
already gone up 0.2 degrees while I've
been standing here talking and it's
going to keep on rising so basically
it's going to work now I need to just
make it not look like literally one of
the ugliest computers of all time and
hopefully that will be better now it's a
twenty six point four so it's still
definitely climbing dollarshaveclub.com
they deliver shavers right to your door
for about a third of the price of that
can I you know greedy razor company that
is their competition both my
wallet and my face finally gets some
relief from the old rusty crappy razor
that I used to use in college but you
know oh well doll shave club comm means
you can afford to shave with a fresh
blade at any point in time which feels
fantastic and for the smoothest shave
ever you get your Dollar Shave Club
blade with there dr. Carver's shave
butter which isn't your average shave
cream it has high quality ingredients
that make your skin feel soft smooth and
moisturized and if you want that
luscious skin feel you can go to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Lynas to sign
up if you're in the US Canada or
Australia Wow everytime after your
Dollar Shave Club integration of super
unshaven anyways guys thanks for
watching hopefully you guys like seeing
the prototype nests of this build there
will be a cleaner one later like I just
mentioned if you want to see that get

can use our Amazon affiliate code to buy
stuff on Amazon that's awesome or you
can become a contributor on the forum
which is also great if you want to see
another crazy build of mine click up
here to see part 1 of the fallout 4 bomb
build also I just want to say it's
already at twenty six point eight
degrees Celsius so this pizza is yeah
let's get one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
