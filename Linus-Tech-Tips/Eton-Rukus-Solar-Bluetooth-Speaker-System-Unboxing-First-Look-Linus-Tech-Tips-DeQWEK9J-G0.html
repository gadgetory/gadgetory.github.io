something that's actually kind of
interesting this is the eatin ruckus
solar portable bluetooth sound system
with solar panel so if you guys ever saw
the episodes I did about the Jambox by
jawbone you'll have some idea what this
thing is however the solar panel is what
turns this from a product that's sort of
mildly interesting to something that is
far more mildly interesting so far more
interesting let's put it that way so it
comes with a coupon for hold up okay
your new eat on I look at an optimist
that Rockets can only get that over
three months of free music with access
to mo g get 15 million songs at your
fingertips download unlimited songs to
your mobile device jam out to new
realest releases a custom radio with
artists only stations hear your music
everywhere cool so comes with a three
month three month voucher very neat
stuff okay it also comes with a power
adapter assumably for charging if you
are not near the Sun which is everywhere
except at night whoa whoa okay let's
have a look at this device I actually
don't know that much about this other
than that it's solar powered which sort
of makes it inherently really cool to me
I'm big into things that I don't have to
buy batteries for or deal with charging
because like many gamers and piecing
sort of types and hopefully you guys can
relate with me here and i'm not just
being insulting i'm pretty freaking lazy
when it comes to charging devices like I
just I can't be bothered to do that
every device should just automatically
recharge itself when I'm done using the
batteries
there we go all right meet new form
factor okay so number one bluetooth
connectivity with one-touch pairing in
control okay high quality stereo
streaming support that's good play music
from bluetooth-enabled smartphone tablet
laptop or PC comes with a little pocket
for throwing your your device into it so
you know hopefully it won't I guess
hopefully it won't fall out I oh oh look
how smart this is look at look look look
look this so there's a slight curvature
to the device here and this sticker
actually add some friction to it so once
you throw your phone in there the onset
falling out okay there there it goes but
even then it's going to bump up against
the handle so you're actually supposed
to carry it like this so then you won't
run into problems with in falling out
but either way that's awesome you don't
actually have to visit no wait so it
doesn't include a USB cable
unfortunately but if you flip this
around you can use the included USB plug
right here to actually charge your
device at the same time that you're
using it so that's that's kind of smart
too it's got an auxiliary in so even if
you don't have bluetooth support with
the device that you want to listen to
music on or whatever else you can just
use and you can just use a 3.5
millimeter cable just good stuff and
then there's a power in so that's sort
of the the ergonomics of the back of it
the top is pretty straightforward it's
covered in solar panels what were you
expecting guys look I know that's what
you were expecting so we've got power
button you has an e-ink display which is
kind of cool there is a button for
Bluetooth button for USB this will
switch to your auxiliary there's base
there's volume up volume down till the
controls are pretty straight for it
looks like it's on so you know what the
only thing to do right now is I try this
thing out so give me a sec here guys and
I'll I'll get the scone
okay so I'm not a dancer but the point
is I've heard a fair number these sort
of Bluetooth speaker things this one has
the advantage of being a little bit
bigger than the twist that we looked at
before as well as the jam box however i
can say with confidence that it takes
advantage of its larger size it delivers
significantly more bass it's not super
loud this is not the kind of device that
you're going to take to the beach and
drive everyone else around you crazy
with like you know how awesome and loud
your beats are whatever else it's not
like that it's very directional sound
which means that if you got your group
on the sand or whatever you position it
a little bit away from yourselves and
pointed at yourselves you're going to be
able to hear it really well whereas the
people around you are probably not going
to be that bothered Perry was quick so
we were able to pair just by holding
down the Bluetooth button it's detected
and paired up no big deal I couldn't
quite figure out how the base control
work but the e-ink display is awesome so
you can actually see right here it's
very very clear and because it's ink
it's extremely power efficient okay that
probably turns the USB charging on and
off so that's kind of cool and then
that's going to again switch to your
auxiliary versus your Bluetooth playback
and again I'm not quite sure how this
works but the volume up and down works
and it's a semi-independent from your
volume control on your phone so a lot of
the time these Bluetooth devices will
sink so you're controlling both of their
volumes at the same time this seems to
be somewhat separate you get up to 8
plus hours of battery life according to
them so in terms of music playback time
and charge is fully in less than six
hours in direct sunlight so overall very
cool little device actually let me just
make sure I'm not missing anything
before we before we wrap up here I think
that pretty much covers its own
conclusion not super loud super easy to
use this not that heavy so it's
something you can easily check into you
know your bag or whatever else you know
it's not going to be that heavy the
bottom is rubberized so it's not going
to slip if you put it down on anything
however ninety percent of the time
you're probably going to be using it
like this it's got rubberized feet there
as well so it can be used either way and
it feels pretty robust like it's
not going to break you immediately or
anything like that thank you for
