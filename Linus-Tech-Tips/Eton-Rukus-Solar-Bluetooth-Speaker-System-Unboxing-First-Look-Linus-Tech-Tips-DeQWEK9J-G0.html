something that's actually kind of
interesting this is the Eton ruckus
solar portable Bluetooth sound system
with solar panel so if you guys ever saw
the episodes I did about the jam box by
jawbone you'll have some idea what this
thing is
however the solar panel is what turns
this from a product that's sort of
mildly interesting to something that is
far more mildly interesting so far more
interesting let's put it that way so it
comes with a coupon for holdup okay
your new Eaton I don't have an optimist
that broca's can only get that over
three months of free music with access
to emoji get 15 million songs at your
fingertips download unlimited songs to
your mobile device jam out to new
realists releases a custom radio with
artists only stations here your music
everywhere cool so comes with a three
month three month Boettcher very neat
stuff okay it also comes with a power
adapter assumably for charging if you
are not near the Sun which is everywhere
except at night whoa whoa okay let's
have a look at this device I actually
don't know that much about this other
than that it's solar powered which sort
of makes it inherently really cool to me
I'm big into things that I don't have to
buy batteries for or Gillick charging
because like many gamers and PC sort of
types and hopefully you guys can relate
with me here and I'm not just being
insulting I'm pretty freakin lazy when
it comes to charging devices like I just
I can't be bothered to do that every
device should just automatically
recharge itself when I'm done using the
batteries
there we go all right neat new form
factor okay so number one Bluetooth
connectivity with OneTouch pairing and
control okay high quality stereo
streaming support that's good play music
from Bluetooth enabled smartphone tablet
laptop or PC comes with a little pocket
for throwing your your device into it so
you know hopefully it won't
I guess hopefully it won't fall out I oh
oh look at smart this is look at look
look look look this so there's a slight
curvature to the device here and this
sticker actually adds some friction to
it so once you throw your phone in there
the odds are falling out okay there
there it goes but even then it's gonna
bump up against the handle so you're
actually supposed to carry it like this
so that you won't run into problems with
it falling out but either way that's
awesome you don't actually have to visit
no wait
so it doesn't include a USB cable
unfortunately but if you flip this
around you can use the included USB plug
right here to actually charge your
device at the same time that you're
using it so that's that's kind of smart
too it's got an auxilary in so even if
you don't have bluetooth support with
the device that you want to listen to
music on or whatever else you can just
use and you can just use a 3.5
millimeter cable which is good stuff and
then there's a power in so that's sort
of the the ergonomics of the back of it
the top is pretty straightforward it's
covered and solar panels what were you
expecting guys look I know that's what
you were expecting so we've got power
button it has an e-ink display which is
kind of cool
there's a button for Bluetooth button
for USB this will switch to your
auxiliary there's base there's volume up
volume down so the controls are pretty
straight port looks like it's on so you
know what the only thing to do right now
is I try this thing out so give me a sec
here guys and I'll I'll get this going
okay so I'm not a dancer but the point
is I've heard a fair number these sort
of Bluetooth speaker things this one has
the advantage of being a little bit
bigger than the twist that we looked at
before as well as the jam box however I
can say with confidence that it takes
advantage of its larger size it delivers
significantly more basic it's not super
loud this is not the kind of device that
you're going to take to the beach and
drive everyone else around you crazy
with like you know how awesome and loud
your beats are whatever else it's not
like that it's very directional sound
which means that if you got your group
on the sand or whatever you position it
a little bit away from yourselves and
pointed at yourselves you're going to be
able to hear it really well whereas the
people around you are probably not going
to be that bothered Perry was quick so
we were able to pair just by holding
down the Bluetooth button and it's
detected and paired up no big deal I
couldn't quite figure out how the base
control work but the e-ink display is
awesome so you can actually see right
here it's very very clear and because
it's inked it's extremely power
efficient okay that probably turns the
USB charging on and off so that's kind
of cool and then that's gonna again
switch to your auxiliary versus your
bluetooth playback and again I'm not
quite sure how this works but the volume
up and down works and it's a semi
independent from your volume control on
your phone so a lot of the time these
Bluetooth devices will sync so you're
controlling both of their volumes at the
same time this seems to be somewhat
separate you get up to 8 plus hours of
battery life according to them so in
terms of music playback time and charge
is fully in less than six hours in
direct sunlight so overall very cool
little device actually let me just make
sure I'm not missing anything before we
before we wrap up here I think that
pretty much covers it so in conclusion
not super loud super easy to use this
not that heavy so it's something you can
easily check in to you know your bag or
whatever else you know it's not gonna be
that heavy the bottom is rubberized so
it's not gonna slip if you put it down
on anything
however 90 percent of the time you're
probably gonna be using it like this
it's got rubberized feet there as well
so it can be used either way and it
feels pretty robust like it's
I'm not gonna break you immediately or
anything like that thank you for
