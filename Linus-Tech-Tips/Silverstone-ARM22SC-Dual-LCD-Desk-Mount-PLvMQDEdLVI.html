for gaming click now to learn more so
slick diesel and I all geeked out
hardcore over this thing at CES 2013
this is the arm 2 LCD interactive arm
which is probably the worst possible
name for this thing but basically it is
Silverstone's dual LCD mount that clips
to your desk and this achieves a couple
of things so number one is it takes the
probably crappy stand that was built
into your monitor and makes it awesome
so it adds things like pivot as well as
height adjust and move anywhere you want
to adjust and number two is it helps
save space on your desk because you
don't have to have the skin actually
down on your desk oh okay I guess I
should show you the box MIT apparently
stands for made in Taiwan if the build
quality of this is anything like the one
we saw at CES then apparently that's a
big deal because it's friggin awesome
it's made of aluminium alloy as well as
steel and pretty much works like this so
there's a piece here that allows you to
clip it to your desk and oh man just oh
I love the way this is built so this
piece right here you can tell is made of
steel because it's got a lot of weight
to it so this is what clips on the desk
and then there's another piece here that
clips to this and then allows you to
clamp it on to the desk this is all
extremely robust that should tell you
everything you need to know about it
that noise right there then the other
pieces are made of aluminum so this guy
right here is the shaft that the two arm
arms screw down onto screws in pretty
deep there you go so that's nice and
solid in there nicely threaded very
lightweight then what you do is you take
two of these and pretty much what these
have are these like spring-loaded
adjustable arms so you can do whatever
you want with them you can rotate them
you can move them up you can move them
down
and you can sort of move them in every
possible direction these are such
gorgeous aluminum's too because they're
extremely lightweight there's plastic
pieces in the bottom of them and then
other than that these are just like
beautiful single piece aluminum pieces
here so you just use hex screws in order
to fix them at the height that you want
and the whole thing pretty much goes
together like that so it comes with an
allen key as well as all the hardware
bits you'll need your monitors will need
to be vase amount compatible so not all
them are but most of them pretty much
are there's some other little pieces
here so there's a little cable
management piece that I evidently missed
but hopefully Diesel's installation
video will be somewhat helpful for all
of that and I think that pretty much
wraps it up other than that I think
we're just going to fill this up with
some glam footage so let us know if you
liked this video about silver stones arm
to LCD interactive arm basically they're
the the market for these aftermarket
monitor stands has just been so stagnant
for so long with not very much
innovation and I'm really happy to see a
truly high quality solution and it goes
to show you how much we've been being
swindled over the years when silverstone
can build this and bring it to market
for a couple hundred dollars when you
were probably paying a couple hundred
dollars for something that wasn't built
out of aluminum and doesn't have this
kind of gorgeous industrial design so
yeah they were taking an awful lot of
margin on these products before so kudos
to silverstone for addressing that and
bringing something truly unique to the
market it holds up to two twenty-four
inch monitors i probably should have
mentioned that before and don't forget
to subscribe if you like this video
don't forget to like this video if you
liked the video or the product or both
and don't forget to leave a comment and
let us know what would you do if you had
a couple of if you had one or all man
you could even run like a couple of
these and you could like put them on
your desk and then you could have
another one then you can even run a
triple monitor display off that position
them exactly perfectly okay we're done
here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
