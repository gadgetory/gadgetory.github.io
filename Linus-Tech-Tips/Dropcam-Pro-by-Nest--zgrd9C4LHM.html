monitoring market by storm and the
Dropcam proclaims to be even better
maybe it's as amazing as they say
maybe it's designed to prey on people
with more money than sense maybe the
truth lies somewhere in between watch on
to find out the jazz mini phone and
tablet stand from Coolermaster is now
available in a variety of cool colors
from these great retailers click now to
learn more the unboxing experience for
consumer friendly products from smart
brands is always good I was actually
kind of fun in this case because other
than hearing ads on the radio I did no
research on the Dropcam Pro before
buying one to do this review the camera
comes pre-installed in a simple aluminum
mount there's a QuickStart guide that
I'll be using to test their 60-second
set-up plane there are some screws in a
wall now that the base clips into and
then I was a bit surprised to find out
that it's powered by a long thick
microUSB cable on a wall wart instead of
something thinner easier to find
sensible places to plug in and more
durable let's go back to the camera
though at the front there's an all-glass
130 degree wide angle lens not good for
a cinematic look but definitely useful
if you want to monitor a large area
since there's no support for pen and
tilt and behind that lens is a new high
sensitivity 3rd inch sensor that's about
2 times the surface area of the older HD
model making it better for low-light
situations you can't see them now but
around the lens are some unexceptional
IR LEDs that it uses for night mode and
then at the bottom we find the micro USB
plug for power or setup if you decide to
use a PC finally internally we find a
speaker as well as a little microphone
port for two-way voice a dual band
wireless end setup and Bluetooth Low
Energy for setting up with a smartphone
or tablet if you choose to go that route
now on to set up but first story time
now I'd heard of Dropcam but I never
really cared about it because I've been
burned by subpar consumer grade network
cameras so many times thought I was just
over them as a category all the ones
that you're looking at now I was given
for free and still never bothered to use
because they were just too useless and
horrible
and it was always the same issues
complicated setup flaky apps rubbish
image quality and worst of all feature
lists that were so short it was almost
like the manufacturer was intentionally
nerfing the product to avoid
cannibalizing the sales of a higher-end
offering in spite of the fact that many
of these companies didn't even have
higher end offerings anyway the thing
that made me say maybe there's something
to this was the fact that nest owned by
Google acquired them and then I knew I
had to review it when I saw their claims
of 60-second setup
did they really find the holy grail of
networking product development was it
that easy to deploy the answer is
actually yeah it takes a lot longer than
a minute and their own website seems to
have been updated to reflect that even
if amazon's hasn't but for pc setup you
plug it in with a USB cable and follow
the on-screen prompts and for smart
phone setup you pair it via bluetooth
install the app and follow the on-screen
prompts the guide they guide you through
creating a Dropcam account connecting to
your Wi-Fi network and placing the
Dropcam within Wi-Fi range somewhere
that it'll monitor something useful so
not the inside of your petal reader then
once it's configured the simplicity
keeps on coming using a browser on a PC
or the app you can monitor the camera
live you can zoom you have two-way voice
communication with people or pets on the
other side I'll be it with a significant
delay and you can categorise repetitive
events so that Dropcam will either
notify you when a certain important
thing happens let's say whenever the
front door opens or ignore it when
uninteresting things happen let's say
when the cat jumps up onto the bookshelf
this is cool because these events also
enable you to much more quickly scrub
through save footage in the PVR of sorry
CVR feature where it marks them on a
timeline so finding out when little
suddenly came home last night is super
easy too bad this functionality is let
down by a couple of small problems so
first it's still beta and there are some
kinks to work out basic stuffs okay but
more complicated classifying things on
its own is a little bit rough right now
and second cv R stands for cloud video
recorder a subscription-based
that you need to pay for monthly in
order to do anything other than monitor
the drop can live yeah
after your pathetic 14-day trial of CVR
to make the let's face it not that
special plastic camera that you already
paid $200 for useful for anything other
than live-streaming you need to pay $100
a year for your first drop cam and $50 a
year for each subsequent one and that's
if you only want the last seven days of
saved footage 30 days costs triple there
is no hardware reason the drop cam can't
store footage on a drive or a PC on the
same network which would save bandwidth
from your monthly data cap and improve
the quality of your internet use
experience since constantly uploading
720p video will affect your network
speed especially if you start adding
more than one camera and while I'm aware
of the feature that turns off video
recording when you're at home that's
kind of ridiculous to me I mean what if
a couple robbers team up for the classic
you make sure they stay in the garden
while I empty out the house strategy I
guess I don't need footage of that when
it comes time to report it for police
right now
so in conclusion while Dropcam solves
some of my original complaints about
network cameras yeah those ones it
really is amazingly easy to use I mean
here look I'll log into it right now you
can go from not being logged in to being
logged in and live monitoring your
camera or reviewing your DVR CVR excuse
me in that much time
zoom in zoom out it's really easy to use
sadly it's yet another device designed
to deliver as little functionality as it
can unless you're willing to fork out
what I really think is an unreasonable
amount of money for the subscription but
honestly I don't blame drop cam for any
of this for over a span of let's say
three years charging each customer $500
to maintain seven days of recorded video
from a camera that isn't weather
resistant is powered by USB for some
inexplicable reason and becomes nothing
more than a fancy baby monitor the
instant that they stop paying for the
subscription drop cam saw customers
paying 30 to 50 bucks a month for much
less useful home alarm systems they
delivered a better product saw amazing
success and got bought out good for
nope the one that I blame is the other
consumer networking and video
surveillance companies who had years to
get their act together and deliver
something that works half decently and
couldn't manage to do it so now we have
this it works I just think it's too
expensive speaking of things that work
half decently and aren't too expensive
and let you watch videos Hulu Plus that
was WOW that was a terrible segue anyway
the plus part of Hulu Plus is key
compared to regular Hulu this gives you
access to all currencies and episodes of
a bunch of Network TV shows on your own
schedule and lets you stream videos on
pretty much any device you already own
like your iPad or Roku Hulu Plus gives
you access to more obscure stuff like
Korean dramas kids shows in Criterion
movies so you can be watching an anime
like sword out online then switch over
to the latest episode of a network TV
show like bones all within the same
service you'll also get access to
originals that you can't get anywhere
else like the awesomes created by Seth
Meyers and Mike shoemaker an animated
comedy about a misfit group of
superheroes all 10 episodes of season 1
are available now and season 2 premieres
on August the 4th so guys be sure to
check out Hulu Plus using my link Hulu
Plus TOCOM slash Linus to get a free two
week trial it costs only $7.99 a month
once you're done with the two-week trial
and if you use the link in the video
description again that's Google Plus
Thomas Linus you get that extra week
free since they actually give you a
one-week trial for free no matter who
you are even if you sign up without a
code but two weeks is better than one
week right yeah unless it's community
service for that time that you anyway I
both they're talking about thanks for
watching the video guys like if you like
dislike if you disliked leave a comment
tell me am I being unreasonable is $10 a
month totally fine and making you add
pay more with each one I mean is it just
a matter of well Linus it's that much
better than everything else so you know
that's why I'd love to hear from you
