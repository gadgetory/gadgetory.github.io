heat sink test bench this is going to be
an X 79 platform with the GTX 580 as
well as a vengeance C 70 case because
it'll allow me to easily mount tall air
cooling heat sinks dual radiator sort of
all-in-one units like the H 100 as well
as single radiator all in one unit such
as the H 80 so the reason I'm setting
this up is so that I can do some testing
but while I was working on getting it
going I pulled my H 100 off of my test
bench and I noticed something that I
wanted to sort of talk about so I get a
lot of questions about should I use my
fans in push you can see this is
configured and pushed the blades are
going to be rotating this way pushing
air through the fins of the rail through
the fins of the radiator out the other
side or do I want my fans in pull which
is where you'd flip them around and have
them pulling air through the radiator so
I don't know if I have an example of
that yes see these ones are configured
and push as well right here so they're
pushing here that way or do I want to
have my fans configured in push-pull so
that's where you actually have fans
pushing on one side and pulling through
the other side of the rad in order to
get well greater static pressure so the
answer to that is actually not that
simple so there's a few different things
to consider so number one is performance
for performance push or pull sort of if
you have two fans on a dual 120 mil
grabs either on this side or on the
other side actually it doesn't matter
this has been proven time and time and
time and time again it's been debated
until you know but you can debate it til
the cows come home it's not going to
change the fact that within margin of
error it performs pretty much the same
now when it comes to push-pull a lot of
people are taking sort of I mean
especially it was fashionable back in
the day and I bought some myself to grab
something cheap like y8 loon fans and
then you know you do a layer of fans a
layer of radiator a layer of fans and
you can turn the voltages of those fans
down in order to make them quieter even
though you have more of them and you
still get decent
for minutes because the push-pull
configuration allows more pressure to be
built up by the fans now think about it
this way guys if I take two fans that
pocket here these two fans are a great
example because of the way they're
positioned if I take these two fans
they're spinning at the same rpm they
are capable of moving the same amount of
air I take this heatsink out of the
middle and I put them next to each other
they're not gonna make the air go any
faster
like the actual CFM is not going to
change what's gonna happen though is if
there's resistance in the middle then
they are going to get the benefit of
helping each other to move air through
the resistance they're gonna gain more
pressure so people often ask me should I
run in push-pull I say no the reason I
say that is because there are so many
fans on the market that are optimized
for pressure such as the SP series from
Corsair although those aren't
necessarily my favorite not to his
f-series or excellent safe gentle
typhoons are excellent Silverstone air
penetrators are excellent lots of good
pressure optimized fans so you actually
have all this pressure available to you
by putting another layer of fans on the
other side all you're doing is
increasing the noise because remember
you can't make the air go any faster in
an open environment and if you already
have a pressure optimized fan then
you're good I mean if you had a non
pressure optimized fan so this older not
to an S series is a great example see
that you could spin that at 10,000 rpm
it would never generate any pressure
because there's so much room for air to
leak around the outside this is not a
good radiator fan where as you see these
nice broad blades on the SP 120 that is
an optimized radiator fan so anyway long
story short is push pull necessary I
would make the argument no get a proper
fan run in pull and there's a reason for
that now when I was taking this radiator
off of my test bench I was reminded why
I normally configure radiators in pull
done so you can see the dead spot in the
middle where the fan hub is and then you
can also see where all that dust has
built up this system was actually
running for about a year on the floor so
that's why there is so much disgusting
dust buildup on it so why do I always
run radiators in pole configuration
because once you've got a fan girl on
there and a fan on here without actually
taking the fan off it is impossible to
clean
the other hand whoops if you run a
configuration like what I did with here
let me just go over here exposure a
little bit there we go if you run a
configuration like what I did with my
thermo chill here you can see this
radiator was also run for a couple of
years and hasn't been extensively
cleaned because the fans on the other
side my Silverstone air penetrators are
pulling air through it so it's very very
simple to just go through once in a
while and you know blow a can of dust at
it or use a vacuum to clean it off
whereas if the fans in the way it is
pretty much impossible to do it and you
end up with something that looks like
this and without taking the whole thing
apart it's very difficult to clean now
this is easy when it's on a test bench
like this but what if it was in a case
what if I had it configured in push with
the fans on the bottom here blowing out
how am I going to clean that it's like
in the middle of a case
whereas if the fans are right up against
the edge of the case and all I have to
do is get in there and kind of go just
take the dust out of it and you are good
to go so thank you for checking out my
little sort of spiel about push-pull
pressure fans non pressure fans don't
