describe as a hot minute since we've
last talked about the cryptocurrency
space on this channel in large part
because the popularity has died down a
ton since it became much less profitable
to mine but then when Anthony stumbled
across the bit main ant router a coin
miner mixed with a Wi-Fi router we had
to check it out we just had to know why
why would this exist why would anybody
buy this especially when you can spend
your money instead on our sponsor
thermal take thermal takes level 20
cases feature radiator mounting for
water cooling gaming focused aesthetics
and beautiful tempered glass panels
check them out at the link below
so crypto mining is pretty much the pits
these days but if you were to think hard
enough you might remember the golden
days back in late 2017 or early 2018
when well actually that really wasn't
that long ago anyway one bitcoin was
worth almost 20,000 u.s. dull hairs and
every news outlet in the world was on
the bandwagon with daily price updates
projections and what-have-you
well as it turns out a natural
consequence of that kind of hysteria is
everyone and his or her dog trying to
get in on the action and there ended up
being a handful of somewhat odd but then
seemingly functional products that were
forged at the heart of the hype storm
itself so one classic example is car
nose qc1
space heater it's a mining machine based
on their very similar qh1
which is an ambient cooled work station
that doubles as a heater when it's under
load so the QC 1 was pretty much the
same thing just with a fancy app
interface tailored for miners it was
advertised as a way to subsidize your
heating bill by mining cryptocurrency
and while actually even today that
machine probably would still be
profitable on top of your electricity
costs with its dual internal rx 588 gig
GPUs the cost for some reason was
thirty-five hundred US dollars up front
GPUs for a space heater that's only
effective for rooms between 150 and 300
square feet by comparison a 100,000 BTU
furnace which is good for about 2,500
square feet can be had brand new for
just shy of $700 now obviously that
doesn't account for installation costs
but I think you get the point then there
was the bit main r4 which was
essentially just a cut-down ant minor s9
with a centrifugal fan that was SPECT to
reach noise levels of only 52 decibels
so they advertised it as being home
friendly
I don't know about you guys but my wife
wouldn't let that thing anywhere near
our house and we have a server room my
wife still doesn't believe in me
bringing us finally to the crazy crypto
contraption of today's video the bit
mean aunt router r3 LTC a litecoin
mining open wrt router that pulse triple
duty has a clock not to mention that it
kind of looks like a cheap Bluetooth
speaker so we bought this thing and if
you ask bit main they'll say that it's
meant to be a portable and ergonomic
router okay I guess that say you can
carry it with you on the go and have
your Wi-Fi wherever you need as long as
you also have an Ethernet cable and
access to a power outlet okay and then
as an added bonus you get a chance to
win 25 light coins every 2.5 minutes
which is basically the fundamental
principle of mining they're describing
the chance to mine a block of light coin
every block cycle which is about 150
seconds what they don't mention is that
with this amount of computing power your
estimated time to find a block is almost
a hundred and four years but I mean hey
man it's still a router right so it's
got to be a pretty decent one
right wrong oh so wrong so the newer
model that we have here the r3 is built
for 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi with a maximum
theoretical speed of 300 megabit across
only the 2.4 gigahertz bend that's right
it's not even dual band Wi-Fi and then
as unimpressive as 300 megabit is in
2018 it gets even better because the
single ethernet port at the back yes
that means no included switch is only a
100 megabit port but then I guess you
know when you're carrying around your
brick sized mining router to the
Starbucks nearby you're probably not
gonna get and speeds any faster than
that anyway all right then so to say
what we actually think this thing is for
I'm gonna need my cynicism hat I don't
have a hat handy Jake find me find me a
hat quickly because from everything that
we've seen so far the only reason that
this product could possibly exist is as
a way for bit Maine to sell off thank
you extra chip stock as each one of
these units has six ASIC chips inside so
the whole thing where it's masquerading
as a portable and ergonomic router I
mean that's just plain ridiculous look
at it what the hell are they talking
about it would take out half your
backpack just for a miniscule chance to
mine a light coin wherever you happen to
be sitting with both Ethernet and power
not to mention that the odds are that it
would take longer than the amount of
time that I still have on this earth
another possibility I'll still be
needing this hat is that it's just a
clever ploy to buff their own and mining
pool as earlier units were actually
unable to switch pools and this one is
still only able to be switched via
command line something that I doubt most
people would do and then making this
possibility even more likely is that
most people even if they did get some
money out of the pool probably wouldn't
even bother to withdraw the $15 a year
that they'd make based on current
estimates further padding bit means
pocketbook okay then so it's not really
a mining machine it's not really a
router but at least it works as an
expensive clock right okay yeah but the
next time I spend $50 on a mining router
clock I would expect it to at least have
a alarm clock functionality probably the
only saving grace for this thing is that
you'll be adding a whole new level of
meaning to your me me Wi-Fi name what
are you looking for something that is an
overpriced and stupid
check out private Internet access VPN
PIAA hides your true IP address and
allows you to bypass your restrictions
and censorship by make
you appear as though you're connecting
from somewhere else and you can use up
to five devices at once it also helps
prevent attacks by blocking unwanted
connections it Auto blocks all traffic
if the VPN disconnects and it keeps your
data out of the hands of advertisers and
other activity tracking snoops so go try
it out at the link in the video
description today
it's affordable and it works so thanks
