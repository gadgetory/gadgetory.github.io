ray got day 2015 not some of you pointed
out that putting all this computer
equipment into a closet could lead to
overheating issues and while this room
actually is technically an exterior room
this is an insulated wall right here and
through this gap is direct access to the
outside and through that gap is direct
access to the attic it's only passively
ventilated and in practice we've gone
from it being pretty close to outdoor
temperature to it being about thirteen
degrees Celsius putting this equipment
in initially to it being about 18
degrees Celsius on a warm day here in
April so from past experience I'm
expecting it to go as high as 35 to 40
degrees Celsius in the heat of the
midsummer obviously that's not
acceptable so we're going to have to put
a contingency plan into action welcome
to personal rig update 2015 part
whatever the crap this is and yes I know
it's not 2015 anymore ventilating the
room
the Aria headphones from Phoenix come
complete with a cardioid clip mic and
acoustic chambers constructed entirely
of Japanese Pinewood check out the link
in the video description to learn more
now as a number of you have noted on at
least several occasions I'm not
particularly handy and when it comes to
knocking out walls and installing
ventilation fans I am NOT going to be
anyone's first choice as a general
contractor so I have brought in my crack
team mark and praxis who are going to be
well helping me with basically doing it
for me but before they can do that
there's some stuff I need to do because
I've already started using this room as
storage again and I've been informed
that all this yes even this that I
worked so hard to put in here has to
come out I guess we'll start by shutting
everything down I'm gonna have no
internet today or tomorrow oh how will I
live it's like a fish with no internet
or water well here we go I'm just gonna
have to haul this out of here my ceiling
mounted access point there we go such
whiners ooh we don't have power we're
running on battery I don't actually have
power in this room so this is a power
bar that runs through the wall to an
outlet and then everything else here is
also just kind of running through that
same hole which is just a hole I made in
the drywall is there perhaps while we're
redoing these walls is there perhaps a
more elegant way to achieve this well I
could actually put outlets on this wall
something I should have done six years
ago basically yeah yeah yeah okay
suggestions
we bought like Oh feet voltage wow
that's a really small so the transformer
it only uses 12 watts also I'm not gonna
have like the the incandescent cage
thing hanging off yeah yeah that's it
mister what you don't like this oh whoa
I think I actually did even put this in
myself now that I think about it yeah it
was broken in this room when I put this
in did I do okay no oh so I mean this is
bizarre I told mark I still had some
more of this like particle board with
like a prime side stuff and he and I was
like yeah you can you can totally have
that you can put more of it in there
he's like you so we are gonna be ripping
all of that out as opposed to just doing
the parts we need to access and
drywalling it you can see it's really
sturdily constructed I mean it's not
like he's taking it apart with his hands
that's totally not a thing that's
happening let's see if I can pull it off
with my hands never oh wow yeah that is
not very good I feel like he man just
ripping walls apart fun facts never
actually seen an episode of he-man I
don't even know what Heenan is the name
of the soap he-man might just be like a
guy on some other Hill you know it's
amazing I told mark I was gonna be here
to help today he still brought a helper
I can't figure out why it explicable I
took out electrical course in high
school thank you so I'm equipped with my
manly purple mask and my light I'm gonna
go find out where those damn cat5 cables
go to I think it's possible that they
actually go to the to the garage but I
think the house was kind of wired for
Ethernet but like not properly so if
they go around the front and across that
way then that will be what they were for
but it doesn't actually look like they
do one of them goes this way where are
you
and why are you going there later
that's the hell I figured out what it is
okay there you get a speaker wire this
is for the it's for the ceiling mounted
speakers in the living room I don't
understand why they're using cat5 for
that maybe there's some reason but that
explains it okay so that is it this how
the heck they're managed to do a drop
unless oh this goes straight down into
that whoa oh that's cool that means if I
want to tell them anything else in that
wall then I could and that is also how
they're getting coax in there I think
okay now I get it
so now that we've got everything torn
out we've got a clear look at what we're
working with and I can outline exactly
what the plan is we're gonna pull off of
this light switch box right here and
we're going to put an outlet in this
room rather than having me run a power
bar through the wall because I'm sure
that the fire department would freak out
if they saw that next we're going to
install this low voltage LED lighting
doodad we have an inline 190 CFM fan
which we'll use to pump air into the
room we need to control that with a
cooling thermostat and this is a low
voltage connection and this is 120 volts
so we need to use a relay to have this
tell really what to do in order to tell
the family to do okay so basically we're
going to climb down into the soffit area
down there we're conveniently there are
already some ventilation duct things
that are for keeping this this
insulation up here ventilated and we're
going to put like a service panel in
here and just have it create a positive
air pressure situation in this room and
then for ventilation out of the room
what we're thinking is we're just going
to leave like maybe six to eight inches
of free space here in the drywall on the
ceiling so that it can just passively
exhaust into the Attic just like that
so we have a plan it's exactly the plan
I would have come up with on my own -
now they're making me vacuum the rodent
guess I get that sort of my rodent poop
not theirs so the first step which you
can see praxis working on here is using
a combination of the included mounting
hardware and a little bit of fabrication
in the soffits to create a mounting
point for the intake fan that's going to
cool the room the fan itself is free
flowed with air so we need to put a
damper in so that when you don't want
air flowing in there say in the winter
when it's cold you want this to stop the
airflow cool now the last step to make
all of this even have a point at all is
to insulate the ceiling because that is
where the heat is coming from from the
Sun hitting the shake roof and basically
conducting heat directly into this room
now fortunately this is relatively
straightforward because we've already
got strapping right here so we're still
going to have enough airflow through
here to keep the wood from rotting but
we are going to have to fill it with
insulation and cover it with drywall in
order to make this room effectively part
of the house rather than part of the
outside so phase one of the electrical
work is actually pretty much done so
we've borrowed 120 volt power from the
old incandescent pulley chain light that
used to be up here and we have brought
it into this box right here so this is
where the light switch for our new LED
light is actually going to go this guy
is going to contain this relay right
here as well as this transformer which
is going to take 120 volt in and turn it
into 24 volt power that our cooling
thermostat can handle without frying
itself whenever the fan engages so
basically what should happen is when the
temperature reaches a certain threshold
when it gets too warm it'll connect the
circuit and in theory that'll turn on
the fan which as you guys can probably
hear is working just dandy exciting so
for the next stage in the project we're
working on putting that electrical jack
in as well as a better pass through into
the room over here the other update here
is that the ducting is now installed so
it's pretty straightforward stuff we've
got some little metal accordion-style
ducting here and then some foil tape
affixing one duct to the fan on this
side so that's where the exhaust is
going to come into the room and then on
the other end we've got another piece of
ducts that's going right down to the
soffit where we're going to have to cut
a hole port outside now the clever among
you have probably realized at this point
that that is just going to draw air not
only from the outside but also from the
rest of the attic where we haven't
insulated and it's going to be quite hot
no not so because we're going to jam
some insulation around the edges of it
so that it can only draw air from the
outside okay so with the poly over most
of the insulation in the walls now and
the drywall mostly mob sort of maybe
about half up we're ready to do an
update because once this wall is dry
walled in this LED light is going to be
permanently mounted so it locks into the
connector a little something like that
then we are going to simulate the switch
by joining these wires and there you go
Dada it's an LED light and Brendan's
gonna have to adjust this exposure
always gonna have to do it again always
gonna have to do it one more time oh no
oh no why does this live with the light
so that's gonna go on the wall so this
is a quick status update more than
anything else I realized that the fan is
a little on the loud side it's actually
audible even through the wall so what
we're going to add is just a simple
dimmer switch and we're just going to
tape it up box it inside here and close
it away because it's not the kind of
thing that you would adjust very often
and the other things that we can have a
look at that have changed since last
time is that the fan has been completely
insulated around now so we are getting
nice cool air like that is frosty air
from outside and finally this puppy has
been reframed for a nice big access
panel if in the future I want to run oh
I don't know more you know phone lines
or coax lines or even power from my
garage or to anywhere else in the house
because from here I can access the
higher up stairs and over to the garage
now I don't have to crawl through like I
did the other day see much easy so we
are pretty much at the end
the room is drywalled and mudded the
access hatch has been mostly created it
just needs a bit of a handle on the
outside and check this out
this dimmer switch has been wired in
it's kind of a getaway of doing it I
know in a perfect world you know the RPM
of the fan would be modulated by
temperature as opposed to just by
manually doing this but this is
functional since it's the kind of thing
that I'm only going to have to set
probably once a season anyway so here's
how it works
we've got the fan on auto the system is
set to cool and if we turn the threshold
down the cooling fan kicks in but if I
kind of go oh gee that's really loud all
I've got to do is before I close up this
little access panel turn that dimmer
switch down and we can find the perfect
balance between acoustics and
temperatures so finally the last step
before benchmarking we've got to put a
grille on the outside air intake which
is under the soffit here preferably one
that is beep roof you know so I don't
have bees in my attic thank you for
thinking is that and then we can
benchmark it and find out just how well
the system works yeah okay don't
so all that's left now is the final
benchmark so in order to evaluate
whether this was a success or failure
because I don't want to just wait around
for the summer and for the computers to
all overheat to find out is to look at
what the CPU temperature is under a
heavy load relative to the outside
temperature when we're running intensive
applications so I'm going to run heaven
in a window as opposed to full screen
oops
as well as I 264 CPU benchmark in order
to evaluate what it will be like in a
worst-case scenario with the door closed
with our new cooling system off and then
with the new cooling system engaged and
so here you have it guys this is the
result
operation cool this room appears for now
to have been a success bringing in cool
air from the outside is going to help a
lot to keep this room cool and at the
rate that that fan moves air we are
circulating all of the air in this room
like every minute or so not really
giving the system's any time to heat up
more than they normally would well that
was fun watching me get burned by the
contractor among other things but you
don't have to get burned if you switch
over to ting the mobile carrier that is
focused on customer service and
satisfaction first when you call them
this is crazy I actually tried it
because I didn't actually quite believe
it when you call them you do not speak
to a robot you get put through directly
to a person they answer the phone
they're like hello this is taken what
and the way that they're billing works
is different from other carriers you
don't have to commit to like 200 talk
minutes during prime hours and blah blah
blah
that megabytes you pay for only what you
use and the average ting bill is only
$24 per month per device if you're stuck
in a contract and you switch to 10
they'll cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to $75 and if you head over to
Lana's ting comm what
is linked in the video description when
you sign up at our link you'll get 25
bucks in service credit or towards a new
device and the savings calculator is
worth your time all you do is enter your
last few bills from your existing
carrier and ting crunches some numbers
and tells you whether you would save
money by switching to ting so check it
out at the link in the video description
