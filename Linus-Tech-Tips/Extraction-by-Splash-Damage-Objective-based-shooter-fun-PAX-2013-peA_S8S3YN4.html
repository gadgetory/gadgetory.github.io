brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys i'm here with
alistair from splash damage and chris
from nexon and i'm going to get them to
give me a brief overview and a little
bit more specifics about the game so
extraction is a team-based
objective-based multiplayer shooter it's
free-to-play you free to win it's set in
London in the back kind of 20 18 20 20
it's been irradiated the streets are
empty and teams of our mercenaries are
kind of roaming the streets fulfilling
contracts and the contracts generally
revolve around securing data cause so
there are shadowy kind of backers out
there who are either one secrets buried
on secrets you know recovered and they
hire these teams of Mercer ease or
rather they kind of high you to go out
there put together these teams of
nurseries to go out there and take them
back so that's that's represented by a
really fantastic objective based team
based gameplay so I both that objective
based team based gameplay how do you
progress through a level and how many
objectives are you expecting to run into
in an average level in this game so it
really differs kind of map by map that's
why things were most excited by is every
map is a different experience so right
now you guys are play Camden what do you
play about half of that map there's also
a map set all over London so Victoria
Whitechapel Canary Wharf Waterloo
Battersea and each map has a different
set of objectives so it's one say the
hoff that you made involved you know
planting a charge and you know hacking a
terminal others involve escorting a kind
of EV and extraction vehicle through the
streets erecting you're destroying
barricades so every maps of different
tactical challenge requires got to be a
different understanding of the map
different teamwork different team
makeups will do kind of you know better
or worse or require different strategy
so it's really exciting to see how other
dynamic changes kind of a
speaking of different team makeups
there's different classes in this game
can you go over those and explain how
they can augment the different gameplay
on defense and offense sure well one of
the things actually that we've got away
from is class white stuff so and that's
that allowed us a lot of freedoms cover
some fantastic characters so really this
is a character driven game so the
character still have roles but it's not
widget Lee adhering to kind of class
structure so that gives us a few really
big wins so for example in some of some
games you know you might come to a point
where there's an enemy Baum you after
disarm and you get there you wipe the
enemy team and then you're out of luck
because you're the wrong class and you
have to still stand there we didn't want
that so all of our classes can I can
hack that can disarm they can plot bombs
they've got different strengths and
weaknesses so for example proxy who
might play today she's got an
engineering background so her character
is so particularly fast the hacking
particular bastard disarming and
planting but everyone can have a go
everyone controller and there that's why
the strengths and weaknesses of each
character along with you know the
weapons they have the special abilities
they have whether it's Vasily's
heartbeat sensor or whether it's a
Artie's airstrike so there's no rigid
adherence to classes it also means that
in the kind of ball game you won't have
to you don't have to have a team that
always consists of that's me one medic
in the team that's been one engineering
a team no you just bring in five of your
favorite characters or you know whatever
they may be the only thing it gives us
is it frees us up to come up some really
creative kind of character combinations
because if we want a guy because you
don't have to have a medical it doesn't
always have to have shock paddles and
always have to have med kits you know
you might have a guy who can whatever i
revived guys at a distance but doesn't
have any healing backs and uses a scout
sniper rifle or something you know what
he could really fit him into a class
before he could really pigeonholing
so lets us great kind of crazy
characters like that if we want to you
know it's um it's really let us be very
creative and come up with the most
exciting characters that we we can in
terms of how they work on offense and
defense one of the other really fun
things about both the characters and the
maps is how much mastery there is to be
had is really important to us that this
is a game that has debt and can be
played in a really competitively a high
level but at same time be really easy
and fun to pick up one of things that's
been great about pax over the last four
days is that you know people who come to
it completely French and they've been
having a blast there's lots of whooping
and hollering and high-five anyone's
having a really good time they were to
pick out very quickly now he definitely
has a point with everyone getting
psyched and a lot of the communication
and high-level play and all I kind of
stuff my friends and I played in the
tournament here and one thing we noticed
is that it you can fall behind
definitely you can fall behind say
you're on the attacking team but as long
as you able to group back up and get you
back together on one of those spawn
waves you as you have the great
communication even if you were doing
poorly before you can come back together
solve that objective hack whatever
pointing out to do plant whatever bomb
and still get out there now this is
probably more for him and sorry for
maybe bring this up but coming splash
damage coming from creating brink as a
brink player what would someone expect
to change when they come to this game I
think when the biggest changes is moving
to a character based system so we can
have a ton of character so we've got
about you saw five today we've already
got about 20 25 ready to go back at the
office so I guess one way to think about
it is almost almost a kind of league of
legends or dota type experience we bring
a character who has you know there's a
lot to learn about that character a lot
to master they have their own strengths
and weaknesses understanding which
mixture of characters makes for the best
team it's really important so that's art
that's a big change for us and its own
that people seem to be really connected
in a really connecting with and getting
really excited about um that's wearing
one of the biggest changes the other
thing is after brink we created a kind
of sister company almost got fire team
handle all of our online services so
wanted to make sure we had no smooth
blackberry connections great matchmaking
all that's
was handled really well so where it kind
of looked other solutions and none were
quite right for us so he created fire
team and not Lee do they handle all of
that but when the reasons that the games
in you know it's alpha now is people
having a really good fun with it people
are saying it's really polished and
we've got some great feedback on the
reasons it isn't that state is because
we have a tool called echo which gathers
a kind of metrics and telemetry for the
games so what you mean by that is every
kind of gunshot every footstep every
cricket back to the face from proxy is
recorded even from these matches out
there and we use that to balance the
maps develop the characters to balance
the weapons and on top of that we've had
fans able to play the game for a while
now so we started to let fans in a kind
of inner circle I've sort of VIPs
they've been playing since 12 12 12 and
they've been giving us foreign feedback
and they've also been of course
gathering you know helping us gather
these stats so balance is incredibly
important for us you know we want this
to make want to make sure this is a
really competitive game that you can
even play at high levels if you want to
you also want to make sure it's really
fair and Venice it's important for a
couple of reasons so I think I said at
the top you know this is a free to play
your game is also a free to win game we
really want to avoid let's say we it's
nexon and splash damage we're not
interested in paid to win you know we
know that that a lot of players you know
on interest in that they want a balanced
playing feel they just wanna have fun so
you know haven't even got a storefront
in the game yet just refocus will make a
really fun core experience that people
can get into I know we've got ideas
about how it can monetize it but it's
all still you know early right now
definitely and talking bouncing back to
the Polish comment you had like i said i
have already played this game more than
once and for alpha or even pre alpha
game it is very polished i do have to
echo that comment that you previously
said now to give a throw it to nexon as
well the the free to play and free to
win motion that's actually very cool
because this is a really polished
good-looking well playing game that will
be free to play a lot of free to play
games especially shooters that people
run into are not usually that polished
on average are not usually that polish
are not that well thought out this is a
really well thought out game so how
exactly is the shop going to work we
haven't really made any decisions at all
about how the shop will work like he
said they haven't even programmed in a
storefront into a build yet because you
know we're with next on we've always
tried to make our games free to play
free to win and with this you know we
took our time looking for the right
title and we wanted to make sure that
you know free-to-play has changed a lot
especially in the last couple years yeah
and I think players are expecting higher
quality games whether they're free or
not than they used to we wanted to make
sure that we had a true Triple A game
and we looked at a lot of different
titles likewise Splash Damage looked at
a lot of different publishers and
eventually when the two met we were like
this is a match made in heaven I mean we
were always really impressed with their
with their pedigree for giving quality
multiplayer shooter experiences and I
think I can speak for them saying they
were impressed with our pedigree for
making free-to-play games so it was just
a good fit and so right now I mean well
we are of course looking at at micro
transaction options we're more concerned
with making the best game we can make
and then the players will enjoy it and
if their players enjoy it they'll want
to pay you know and that but we want to
make it a great experience for whether
you're a free player or paid player we
want you both to be able to have a great
time playing the game that's a great
like pre-emptive statement because
they're basically saying you won't have
to invest anything in this game if you
don't want to or don't need to so once
you grow an attachment to the game you
can deck out your character you can get
skins for different things i'm assuming
whatever comes down the line i don't
know i'm just throwing that out there I
hope I didn't break anything so if
you're interested in a free-to-play
shooter that's well polished and might
have some customisation options down the
future you should definitely check it
