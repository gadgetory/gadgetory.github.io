explain take this let's go fresh books
is the super simple invoicing solution
that lets you get organized save time
and get paid faster click now to try for
free so if you're anything like me
you're not done shopping for Christmas
but the local stores are crazy busy out
of stock and full of boring crap so is
there still any time to shop online
I mean shipping times will never work
out right wrong Amazon doesn't play
around they don't claim shipping
estimates they actually give you the
date that it will be at your location
buy and they're still offering two-day
shipping on a load of items we chose
gifts based on cool stuff we found with
fast shipping guaranteed and preferably
also standout deal we sorted the ideas
by intended recipient in with time
stamps down below for your convenience I
mean you're in a hurry right so initiate
emergency gift guide suggestion sequence
now are you shopping for a gamer Etzel
is our mouse guy he suggested the
SteelSeries rival it's under 50 bucks
and features a rubber side grip set up
with a 3310 sensor for pixel-perfect
tracking someone need a keyboard g7 10
series is 32 percent off comes with free
shipping and offers brown or blue
switches lystad a video on it back in
the day and I use it as my daily driver
for work does your gamer prefer the
couch maybe check out the steam
controller it's quirky but actually
rather cool check out my review up here
this should enable your game reader
person to play a wider variety of games
on the couch which may enable more
cuddles if you and your gamer person are
into that or they're not currently couch
gaming but would like to check out the
steam link this little device will
enable them to use their gaming computer
anywhere in the house that they can get
a networking cable to also check out
Linus's in-home streaming video here is
your person interested in quality audio
the HD 598 special edition headphones
are available at a pretty smokin deal of
40% off and free shipping the 5 9/8 are
very well known and if you want to
review check out Linus's video here more
into speakers well polk audio has their
well reviewed TSI 100 bookshelf speakers
either in cherry or black this one is a
little sketchy because it's not shipped
by amazon but they do have fast
estimated shipping options and at free
shipping with the 51 percent discount
it's hard to be more into big home
theater setups how about starting with a
sony receiver the strd n8 50 receiver
supports seven point
two channel setups with 4k video and
built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it's also
able to deliver 150 watts per channel at
6 ohms which is pretty legit
it also has free shipping and it's 40%
off need some speakers for that receiver
the Infinity premise 3-way
floor-standing speakers are 60 freakin
5% off making them quite cheap and they
have free shipping these are the number
one best seller and floor sanding
speakers and are very highly rated for
their price alright alright you need
something simpler how about a sono setup
that's what Linus got for his parents
you can check out that video here
straightforward setup good sounding
audio and multi-room audio streaming
still quite expensive but convenience
costs none of that really it's cool I
got more are they into cooking what
about a sous-vide cooker what the heck
is that great question it's a Wi-Fi
controlled precision cooker that you
clip onto a pot to control the
temperature of the water inside really
really accurately and then you clip a
baggie filled with food on the other
side of the pot and let it cook for a
predetermined amount of time which you
can get from the Innova app for your
phone
this results in incredibly good and
incredibly consistent results this has
been a big thing for restaurants for a
while and now you can do it at home want
a handy gift what about a dremel 4,000
it's a wicked price for 50% off and free
shipping this thing is highly
recommended by honestly every
professional computer modder I've talked
to about it and I would recommend it to
is your person in a long-distance
relationship with you or someone else
are they trying to get into game
streaming on Twitch or something check
out the logitech c920 it's currently 40%
off has free shipping and I love it I
use it all the time from my personal
Twitter stream twitch.tv/eds core la FR
but the audio is not really up to par in
that case due to current discounts i'd
recommend either the audio-technica ATR
2500 or the 80/20 20 USB plus the 20/20
is a legendary mic but a little pricey
even at 47 percent off so the ATR 2500
may hopefully be able to fit into your
budget a little bit better are they
going to school or need a cheap laptop
for some other reason the HP stream 11
isn't the fastest thing out there but at
200 bucks it's more than capable of
note-taking machine or let's be honest a
glorified Facebook machine for while
you're in class what about tech stuff to
improve their house
well their computer or other various
electronics should probably be on a UPS
the number one bestseller in this
department is from cyber power
unfortunately the 1500 volt ampere j'en
has been selling a little bit too well
so you won't be able to get it in time
but the 1350 volt amperes can get to you
before Christmas so you're good
or there's a google onhub router it's
not on sale but this kind of gift item
is for you and for them assuming that
you're their personal IT it's pretty
damn good device as you can see here in
my review but it also allows for remote
diagnostics to make your life easier as
well know already good on a router what
about a smart thermostat the nest
third-generation Learning Thermostat
looks cool is easy to use and can help
them save on their energy bill still
nothing all right what about a freakin
solar panel okay hear me out if they
have a back shed or garage that they
don't want to run power to because it's
difficult and can be crazy expensive
they can rig up this 100 watt 12 volt
panel to a deep-cycle battery and power
inverter listed in the frequently bought
items below to get a pretty decent
starter set up that should be able to
handle their lights just fine okay okay
back down to earth for a second what
about everyday life improvements the
asu's n watch 2 is a great no-frills
wearable that you can see Linus's review
on up in the top right hand corner
there's some issues with stock on a few
models but never fear some are still
available not their thing already got
one how about the tile generation 2 you
can use these little guys to track your
phone your keys or realistically almost
anything else like your backpack or your
car shopping for someone forgetful maybe
not a bad idea the batteries and side of
phones are just universally horrible
these days so basically anyone could use
a boost now and then but most portable
batteries have really sketchy reviews or
are rather expensive for this I would
suggest the Amazon basics either ten
thousand or sixteen thousand one hundred
milliamp hour batteries two practical
and boring shopping for someone who
would be interested in some quirky desk
stuff how about the yo soo funny c-shape
magnetic levitation floating globe world
map LED light whose name honestly speaks
for itself
still nothing you're killing me smalls
all right what about hiking gear or a
bug-out kit or
emergency supplies or whatever still got
to be tech inspired so I'd recommend a
combination of the cheero tough 9000
milliamp hour ip66 rated water-resistant
dust proof shock resistant battery bank
and maybe the X dragon high efficiency
20 watt solar panel charger so you can
keep all of your devices and ready to go
in the case of emergency or even just
for a long hike or camp oh whoo okay
hopefully you guys found something in
there that enticed you I think we
covered quite a few bases good luck on
getting it all shipped in time if you
found this video useful be sure to give
it a share and give it a thumbs up
actually if you liked it as well if you
liked a bunch of the stuff on here but
are done chopping it also may be a good
idea to share it to people who may be
shopping for you you can get razors and
other bathroom supplies shipped directly
to your door for only a few bucks a
month this includes stuff like dr.
Carver's shave butter one wipe Charlies
and post-shave moisturizer and they have
a variety of razors all the way up to
the six blade executive which doesn't
have any need for vibrating handles and
other crappy nonsense like that just
high-quality razors and other bathroom
supplies right to your door once a month
