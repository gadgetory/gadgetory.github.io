unboxing of some Oh Suzie fatality
edition Ram so what makes fatality
fatality well first of all it comes in a
red and black package so that is for
high performance so it has high
performance packaging next is the
official memory of championship gaming
series signed by 12 times world champion
Jonathan fatality Wendell get the gear
used by the pros okay on the back you
will see a portrait of Jonathan Wendell
here and that's sort of like a red and
black style and then when you open up
the box okay we got a little insert okay
there was also a picture of it on the
front end it on the inside it shows you
oh that's pretty nice how to install
memory so you can learn how in English
German Spanish French or Italian pretty
good okay so why don't we get these
modules actually removed from the
packaging here and we'll have a look so
it uses OCC's by now very standard XTC
extreme thermal convection something
along those lines at heat spreader so
that means that in between okay instead
of using a solid heat spreader like they
used to ocz uses the this one with holes
and the theory and it's been they've
demonstrated it to be proved true in the
past is that the actual ventilation
holes combined with the the surface area
they still have with the metal actually
provides better cooling than the solid
heat spreaders used to so these
particular ones have the fatality
branding on them you can see the one I
have here today is a ddr2 module it's a
ddr2 1066 or pc2 8500 and it runs at 677
latency it's a two gig module so there
are four gigs total of this kit although
there are fatality brand modules
available in a variety of different ddr
types and speeds and whatnot this is
more just a showcase of the overall look
of these modules so you've got a black
PCB you got a nice black heat spreader
so
look from the top and from the side is
quite nice when it's installed in your
system and that pretty much concludes my
unboxing of the ocz fatality series gran
modules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
