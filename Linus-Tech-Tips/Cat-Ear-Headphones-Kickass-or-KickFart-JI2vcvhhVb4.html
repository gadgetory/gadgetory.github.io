headphones absolutely smashed their goal
on IndieGoGo about a year and a half ago
I knew I had to have them not because I
thought they looked good not because I
thought they would sound good but
because the beginnings of the kick
farted video format we're already
forming in my mind and these things had
epic disaster written all over them but
let's see how that turned out then shall
we
the Aria headphones from Phoenix come
complete with a cardioid clip mic and
acoustic chambers constructed entirely
of Japanese Pinewood check out the link
in the video description to learn more
our epic tale begins as it always seems
to with the original delivery date
estimate of April 2015 given to me when
I backed this project in October of 2014
it took all of one month to get the
inevitable derp we actually can't use
the manufacturer we intended email
something to do with a poor human rights
record fair enough and after four months
of radio silence an update comes through
work stone will be taking over a
customer service and manufacturing cool
shortly afterward I sent an email to
Brookstone asking if I could get one of
the first off the line to facilitate a
timely review they told me that
pre-sales go up in the fall so I replied
back saying I'd never asked that and I
had already bought one and then I never
heard back so all right then from there
the backer updates were actually looking
great
August onward is rapid fire photos of
prototypes and good news all around so
the why has it taken until now for you
to review it Linus good question a
combination of it being shipped to my
old address in spite of me sending a
request to find out where it was being
sent so that I could change it through
IndieGoGo and the shipment eventually
being abandoned after an apparent
attempted delivery to the wrong address
though I never actually got any notices
which took about six months to finally
resolve though to the credit of accent
ware and Brookstone who seems to have
basically acquired them outright they
did eventually deliver my product which
is good but what about the headphones
are they good well honestly at a hundred
and thirty dollar retail price I've seen
much worse than the cat phones that's
what I'll be calling them you get a
surprisingly rugged carrying case a
meter long cable with inline volume
control and a gaming grade bendy
microphone that feels kind of cheap and
sounds a little something like this
moving on the folding hinges do not lock
and the size and swivel adjustments are
plastic and will therefore wear out
relatively quickly but the leatherette
covered ear cups and head
and have a thick and soft if not
especially breathable memory foam
covering them not too bad but in the old
random pair of headphones from a
completely unknown brand even one with
decent build quality shouldn't have
performed this well as a crowdfunded
product let's discuss the main selling
point
these plastic carriers are not just cat
ears they also along with the ear cups
light up for up to 5 hours in the color
of your choosing
I ordered purple and they have speakers
inside so you can share your music with
your friends and family in a unique and
creative way according to the marketing
materials
thanks to these add-ons the cat phones
are a little on the heavy side but I'd
still described them as reasonably
comfortable even after an hour or more
of continuous wear but of course I
wasn't actually expecting any of that
stuff to suck it would be relatively
hard to screw up a plastic mold and some
LEDs at this point so let's talk audio
quality the kind of thing that's easy to
brag about on a spec sheet with
frequency response numbers but that is
actually very difficult and requires
decades of engineering experience to
deliver the cat phones are better than I
expected not an a wow these are great go
buy them now kind of way but in more of
a they've surprisingly aren't the worst
thing I've ever heard kind of way lows
are handled surprisingly competently at
low to moderate volumes with tighter
bass than I expected though at higher
volumes distortion does set in and if
mids and highs behaved in a similar
manner you'd actually have a pretty
competent pair of 100 ish dollar or less
headphones on your hands unfortunately
they sound kind of like there's a sock
over them or something with vocalists in
particular coming across like they're a
little too far from the microphone at
closer to 40 to 50 bucks they actually
be pretty compelling on a pure sound
quality basis but what about the other
features pressing the second button from
the back activates the speakers built
into the ears at low volume to help you
avoid getting punched on the subway
you'll need to actually turn it up each
time you activate this feature
and turned up they actually sound
alright I guess not nearly as good or
even as loud as a high-end Bluetooth
speaker like a UE boom but better than
trying to use your phone so there you go
which leads us finally to the answer to
the question posed in the title of this
video evaluating the cat phones as
headphones there's no contest DT 770
pros from Bayer dynamic can be had for
the same price they both sound and fit
much better with HyperX cloud 2 headsets
available in masculine or feminine
flavors for actually significantly less
if having a microphone is your thing so
it comes down then to how much value you
assign to the statement that you're
making by wearing these for me that's
not much to people I've never met I'd
rather wear unfashionable audiophile
headphones and looked like someone who
appreciates craftsmanship rather than
someone who thinks cat ears are cool and
besides I've come up with my own way to
stand out from the crowd for having
absolutely no taste
but I suppose everybody's got to blaze
their own Trail in this regard but what
if you wanted your internet connection
to blaze a new trail through the United
Kingdom or the United States or
something along those lines and you
didn't want internet providers tracking
your web browsing
well tunnel bear is their simple VPN app
