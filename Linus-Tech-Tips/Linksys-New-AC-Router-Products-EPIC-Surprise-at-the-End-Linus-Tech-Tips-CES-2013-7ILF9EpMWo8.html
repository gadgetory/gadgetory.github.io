our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys we're here in the Linksys suite
where Matthews gonna be telling us about
the product refresh that they are
bringing to the market this is pretty
much the the first real generational
move in Wireless since we went from G to
n is that correct
that is absolutely correct so show us
the the Beast of all beasts the AC 1750
sure so we actually have an AC 1750 in
the market today but what we're doing
with this refresh through the spring and
availability you'll be later in the
spring is we're gonna buffer it up and
take a little bit more power behind this
and give you a USB 3.0 port and the
capabilities of our new AC routers
through the spring as well are also
gonna have part of the specification of
AC which includes beamforming technology
and you I'm assuming you know what
beamforming is last why don't you
explain it to me and the viewers okay
sounds great I would say that
beamforming is gonna take let's use the
lightbulb analogy if you would turn on a
light bulb it would give you coverage
throughout your entire home if you were
to turn on a flashlight it would give
you directional coverage towards where
you're aiming it same idea with
beamforming technology it's gonna take
the antenna configuration and it is
gonna send the Wi-Fi signal directly to
those devices throughout the home so
obviously are gonna get faster transfer
rates and you're gonna have a better
experience
so tell me two things number one is do
the antennas have to physically move and
number two is how does it know where
your devices are so no the antennas are
not gonna move that's part of the
specification built into it and your
second question was how does it know
where the devices are it is going out
looking for the devices pinging those
devices once it's established a
connection being forming starts to do
its work and that's how you're gonna see
the benefit so it's gonna have to have
multiple antennas if it's gonna have any
idea where something is located is that
correct correct and these at all three
of our routers that you see in front of
you right now these are all three by
three antenna configuration routers on
the AC side I'll
very cool so I mean something that our
viewers may or may not have picked up
from that as usb3
is not only going to you know look blue
and sexy on the back of the router but
what it's also gonna do is it's gonna
allow you to take advantage of that AC
transfer speed with a network attached
to storage device that can be something
as simple as a plain old external USB 3
hard drive so let's go ahead and put
this one down because this is probably
gonna be pretty expensive so maybe not
every viewer can afford the super uber
premium one so why don't you tell us
about the AC 1600 sure so the biggest
difference between the two and it's
pretty straightforward - and viewers
obviously is that we're taking you from
AC 1750 to AC 1600 so what we're doing
is we're still gonna give you the great
speeds on the five gig spectrum at 1300
megabits per second but on 2.4 instead
of 450 megabits per second we're gonna
take you down to 300 so again you're
still gonna get pretty good 300 megabits
per second speeds on 2.4 but still have
1300 megabits per second on the five the
other difference that we'll notice here
we've also taken one of the USB ports
away so we're gonna give you USB 3.0 but
not that additional USB 2.0 port okay so
you still get to take advantage of the
fast AC transfer speeds for your network
attached storage but just you don't have
that other auxiliary port that is
absolutely correct
okay now this guy over here has like a
green box and sort of is smaller than
the other ones what is the key
difference between the EEA 6300 and the
other two that we just looked at
sure so again we're gonna go back and
look at the speed and what this is gonna
do for you this is the entry level in
our AC lineup 300 megabits per second on
the 2.4 867 on the 5 gigahertz spectrum
so when you put it together you're
upwards to AC 1200 as a combined speed
so again it's just a little bit less
speed on the AC spectrum but if you need
more you easily take yourself up the
line and choose the right product for
you again on the back USB 3.0 port 4 gig
land one gig lan very straightforward
okay now here is here's sort of the
trick now AC is still not that prevalent
out there so we're gonna move actually
sorry diesel we're gonna move this way a
little bit so I actually tested on on my
youtube channel right
a USB you know unnamed you know
competitor D say for example an unnamed
USB stick that was AC 1200 and I put
that up against a Wireless and 450 not
some other USB stick competitor t say
for example what we discovered was that
the 450 was actually dramatically faster
than the AC USB stick so if the USB
sticks aren't there yet and they're not
ready to take advantage of the speed can
you show us what you guys have to allow
customers to actually use the AC gigabit
wireless yeah it's absolutely a great
point Linus and you hit it right on the
head so what we did when we launched our
AC 1750 SKU into the marketplace in the
spring of 20 the fall of 2012 is we
launched the universal media connector
alongside it's a single band four port
AC media connector so for the customer
that is buying any one of the spring
routers coming up or the one that's
currently in market you're now gonna be
able to transfer up to 1300 megabits per
second wirelessly from router to bridge
and any one of those four devices that
are plugged in so we looked at that as
an opportunity to say let's bring not
only the router to market but let's give
him a corresponding media connector to
do the job that we know AC can do so I
mean that was a bit of I let him on on
that one a little bit because I already
knew that the media connector just
absolutely destroys both the n450 and
the USB AC stick and we actually tested
one of those as well so it was something
along the order of about four or five
times faster than either of the other
solutions so I think that pretty much
wraps it up for our CES 2013 coverage of
the Lynx is sweet thanks again Matthew
