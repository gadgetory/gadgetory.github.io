the DIY desk PC project and ignoring all
the complaints about those ugly legs
they look so terrible and they're awful
there were two main points that I plan
to address in this the final final video
number one how on earth are you guys
going to get that monstrosity upstairs
and into your office and number two I
forget right why is it that after
sitting through three freaking videos
and waiting once I only get to see like
30 seconds of glam footage well we're
going to address those things today
which I sort of already said
the Phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with Cherry MX switches and a
new white backlit variant check it out
at the link below okay can we go through
can we go through the plan okay plan
time so first okay couple key things we
don't want to get any additional
scratches I am quite certain that none
of these marks are from me but for some
reason there are a wack ton of marks
along the edge okay so we don't want any
additional scratches we need to take the
glass off the table see I was laughing
scratch okay second hand glass so we'll
take the glass off put it somewhere safe
okay so that's step one why don't we
actually just start with this one but
but we have to be no we can't scoop the
glass because if we screw the glass it
will scratch the paint surface
underneath it so we have to lift the
glass which is stuck to the paint a
little bit which I did not anticipate
bloody help well it's a good thing we
got the camera rolling if we're going to
have shenanigans now I got this side all
my fingers oh okay hold on hold on don't
lift yet though because these frames are
really fragile okay how we doing Wow
these gloves are really slippery yeah be
careful that makes me nervous okay I got
it
okay oh man my options were this guy or
Dennis what hey I can move stuff it's
easy I just have a bad at it here why
don't we just put it on this garbage can
oh that's a great place for it I'm going
to grab a measuring tape and I'm going
to prove that it is centered where you
just put it I can't find a measuring
tape you lucky toes so it's funny
because this wasn't a planning thing but
our stairs are actually wider than
normal stairs because we put our server
room under them and I needed some extra
width that could be what ends up saving
this project because I'd be lying if I
said that we fought at all about moving
it upstairs
now I'm pretty sure that the cut out in
the middle is going to allow us to
rotate through the door okay we can
start bringing it down okay you guys
rolling because if he's going to get
tired and drop it down the stairs I want
you at least to capture it okay here we
go oh dang this is a really tight
hold on no no we got to move so there we
go there we go oh that was very very
close okay I know you're first oh crap
my other desk is still in there what
just hold on okay okay my office is
finally going to be actually complete
also my computer is still like booted up
and stuff I was not very prepared one
moment oh we could just just on this
daughterly well I was kind of thinking I
might lose my desk cause I'm in the room
okay so what started out as a simple
swap the desks operation actually has
gotten more complicated taryn's you mind
grabbing that side so we're going to
move it over here our new writers are
going to be taking up a lot of the space
that I would have had downstairs in the
warehouse so I'm actually going to move
my bench marking area here hold on
miscalculated the GPS position
okay perfect okay so there's networking
there this is my new UPS and I still
haven't installed and then let's go get
the new desk one two three so you can
see those open holes on the sides now
have these blue furnace filters
obviously blue was not the ideal color
but I have yet to find them available in
white or black still working on that but
the idea is that all the air no no no I
have to sit back there the idea is that
all the air coming into the case will be
filtered alright let's go ahead and
scooch it right over to the wall here
yeah oh so everything gets drawn in here
across and down nope okay oh I'm fine
well it's hard when it's like that okay
just okay hold on hold on okay all the
way
okay okay yeah okay you good okay let's
just lean it up against that okay well
first the ultimate in static space
cleaning techniques wipe everything down
little cloth good okay another key
aspect of this is that your left-hand
side needs to go in and slide towards
the end first but hold on don't move it
don't move slide without scratching
paint so okay just in as tight as it can
be Hey
it's supposed to be a little bit yeah is
it well okay okay
perfect pitch well good luck with the UH
okay with you oh thank you computer you
have it here thank you thank you so I
guess this is the part of the video
where I reveal the big twist the big
secret the reason it's so important to
clean all this stuff and have it look as
perfect as possible is this will be our
first video officially shot at 8 K on
red so without further ado enjoy the
Glen footage
