a router that's far cooler than it first
appears to be my first you look at it
and you go oh they took a router and
they put yours on it must have been made
in Japan
Buffalo happens to be a Japanese company
ok moving right along though this is the
WCR 600 d HP this is a high power so
they're going for an extra well power
for enhanced signal strength and
performance dual band simultaneous 300 +
300 megabits per second which honestly
is as fast as any of your devices at
this point anyway gigabit ethernet ok
for maximum wired speed multi-platform
blah blah blah right there BAM
actually there's a better level double
been dd-wrt so this router is a
high-powered writer router that is hold
on slick was complaining his camera work
isn't good enough to compensate for the
the reflective wrapping so there you go
dd-wrt logo it also is ready for
BitTorrent Wi-Fi Protected setup Wi-Fi
and whatever that is
so dd-wrt is a third-party firmware that
allows you to unlock additional
functionality and features on what would
otherwise be a stock router so by
calling out the dd-wrt Gnaeus of this
router they have actually effectively
said look this is compatible with what
is widely regarded to be the best
third-party firmware out there it has
these high-powered sort of features that
are cute and adorable and it's not that
expensive so what else is there to
really say ah this ok this was there AC
router so this it falls below an AC
router in terms of the performance but
is and and a little bit behind sort of
the 450 megabit per second stuff on
wireless end but honestly yeah you'd
never really notice the difference
between Wireless than 300 or 450 on for
example your iPad because your your iPad
doesn't even support 450 and I think a
lot of devices are gonna get support for
AC and skip 450 entirely because it's
just my personal opinion so if I was
looking for something very customizable
that again is extremely cute you know
japanese this might be what I go for so
I'm gonna get this assembled and D
ratified a mobile yeah gentlemen reset
buttons located on the bottom of the
router there's also a handy indicator
for how to install these stand there you
go look okay maybe I didn't do it right
give me a sec ah there we go okay to
install the staff you've also got movie
engine on and off so I guess that's
probably just a QoS feature diagnostic
router these are the two bands 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz power yes
there's your Wi-Fi Protected setup ok
cool stuff oh shoot I forgot I was
trying to avoid touching the shiny set
oh that's not bad that's actually
surprisingly uh can you can you tell
that the fingerprints aren't that bad on
there Wow usually I see ok guys I see
surfaces like this and then I'm like oh
that means I can never ever touch it but
this is this is actually ok now let's
see if it gets scratched when I wipe it
off because that's the other that's the
other mark of death for for shiny stuff
yeah it gets micro scratches when you
wipe it but realistically you should be
hiding this under a table somewhere
anyway so I guess if you're if you're
that fussy about it then okay the point
of this is the firmware and the power
guys moving right along you can turn the
router on/off or auto so that makes this
easy to use as just a wireless access
point it has a hardware switch for
turning that off very handy ok USB eject
USB port for storage as well as for
gigabit ports your LAN port and your
power in in terms of accessories we've
got buffalos characteristic flat
Ethernet cable
doot-doot-doot like see that the heart
right there we've also got a power
adapter it comes on the wrapper with you
know the SSID as well as the key that
are initially set up as well as the
information needs to put this one works
just in case you forget and you don't
know how to use Google to look up
I mean well know you can know how to use
Google but it's not always convenient ah
screws the hold this on there we go
see they thought of this someone at some
point was like no no it doesn't stay on
screws done deal
alright and no way they actually huh so
there's like different there's different
feature checklists depending on the
whether you use the stock firmware or
the dd-wrt firmware there's a setup
guide as well as the warranty statement
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look it's actually a pretty
cool looking runners don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips from our boxing's
reviews and other computer videos and
it's also a spaceship you can slide this
in here and then it's meant to be
oriented like this you can hold it like
