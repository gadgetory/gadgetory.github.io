five minutes late today and we were only
five minutes late today I'm pretty sure
the audio is working
I hope the audio is working if the audio
is not working
I will actually cry like I will I will
cry we're gonna check the twitch chat to
make sure the audio is working welcome
everyone to the live lioness tech tip
show we are here for all of your
enjoyment and of course our own
enjoyment because slick loves nothing
more after he has spent the day filming
with me than to what yeah alright it's
flickering flicker on the screen I don't
know our feed looks okay it's flickering
whatever okay so we have another chance
to eat dinner yet tonight I hope you
guys forgive us for being a little bit
slow kind of getting into the show
probably the most important cake I've
ever had a chance to met this morning so
I had to be at work early probably I had
to wear a dress shirt just about this no
dress pants shiny shoes the funny thing
too is I I wore my sandals I was like
guys and I dressed up for you Incline
wore a dress shirt today we were like
and yeah we're watching it okay we're
good now right guys let's get that
twitch chat going again cuz you guys you
guys are you guys are fast to help us
get that fixed alright yeah okay so the
kind of things that we should have to
sort of you know done by now but okay to
give you guys some idea what do you
think the speed I averaged on the way
back here from Richmond to us mm-hmm no
cops watching right I don't even know
like just ridiculous we made it all the
way from them t IX headquarters in
Richmond Sports moves in like 29 minutes
to my house which is trust me not a good
thing anyway so right sorry slick always
has dinner he ate separately that time
so nice don't worry about it ah right so
my meeting today was with like the most
important person ever who is like like a
global director of marketing for Samsung
SSDs or something like that like just
like crazy crazy stuff so I wear shiny
shoes I had like a shirt and like pants
and a belt and like I did my hair today
but you can't really tell anymore cuz
total mess but yeah so that was really
exciting spent like two and a half hours
and that meeting just you know marketing
strategies and stuff for those of you
watching the livestream who don't know
I'm a product manager at NCIX so that's
like my real job I don't remember where
I was going with this you're just
talking oh yeah it's been a long day I
had to go in early because it's someone
like that and they're making time like
they flew from Korea right right so he's
like making time to like get on a plane
from Korea and come here and come to our
office and talk to me so it's like if I
won't go in like you know half an hour
or an hour early to work then that's
like the rudest thing ever so I'm like
yeah yeah yeah no no no problem
and then so I was at work at sort of
9:30 ish today which means that by the
time we're done this livestream it'll
have been like a 13 hour workday which
is sort of sweet we filmed a really cool
episode today though maybe slick can
tell you about it while I try and take a
couple bites of food we built a computer
in the FTO 3 mini and that's a pretty
sick case actually so most of our stone
cases are pretty epic but for a small
case this computer's really cool we fit
we fit a 670 in it and for its size if
you like actually go and look at a
picture of it for its size that's
ridiculously impressive so that was a
really fun build Oh what else we get we
did a lot of unboxings no I'm in the
crash in the case what's the name of
that the we put the little Asus ITX
deluxe board but I don't remember its
actual name z77 I I just I deluxe okay
you know the asus speeds ozone i deluxe
3570 k although we could have used 3770k
we just had a 35 70 K SSD course crucial
M for low temps you guys for like what
were they like for the CPU is around 28
no no I don't I don't was 28 yeah Oh low
temps low the cups I think we're around
50 degrees
yeah and then on the GPU is like 70
degrees like totally normal temps one
fan in the system because we put a water
cooling and water cooler in there well
there was there was the air penetrator
and then there was the fan that came
with the water cooler mm-hmm you didn't
put the fan with no you're not supposed
to oh there's no room for it okay
you used the air penetrator at the
bottom of the case and then even though
it doesn't quite aligned with the
radiator it's very directed airflow so
it was right through the radiator anyway
the case yeah I thought it just was like
basically starting
who's asking if Roseville is a good case
manufacturer on the twitch chat like
come on guys
Rose well how is Roseville a
manufacturer of anything these rows will
a good case manufacturer and why is the
there all this stuff I don't know what's
going on here I'll have to fix that
later
um yeah Roseville doesn't make anything
Roseville is new eggs like like no name
brand so it's like whatever OEM stuff
and then they put Roseville on it so
there you go that's me film today Oh
like I said a lot of unboxings for NC I
expected I don't really remember was it
just the FTO 3 I think that was it I
think we were gonna try and do H 100
versus H 100 I versus we started that
that's why we unboxed the hei all right
all right the thermal right Silver Arrow
was it extreme I think though yeah
thermal radiate a Silver Arrow extreme
which looks amazing the fans look a
little weird but it looks yeah it looks
amazing
well it's a color screen with those fans
red and is like red borderline pink and
then for the like casing of the fan and
then like bright fluorescent orange for
the blades just a little bit a little
bit out there a little big scream I
guess it definitely extreme definitely
extreme definitely extreme um and then I
worked on the gauntlet known episode but
we weren't done that had some problems
with Wireless not let the mountain is
wired but no excuse me no seven nature V
- that's not even if someone says I know
far too little about the business it
seems I'm not sure what business he's
talking about but it's been my entire
job for like five years so I think I
know something mm-hmm okay
my hands quite a bit better I still
can't close it that's all I can do for
trying to close my hand but it works
down so that's good okay so why don't we
do a couple Twitter questions we've got
some pretty good discussion topics for
tonight we're just like really hungry so
sorry all right let's head over to
Twitter let's see if there's no work
that gonna work
yes that's not even the right why did we
have it oh I remember okay
yeah because the last time we use this
we were doing like a totally totally
totally different thing and it was not
not Twitter and there we go so now we
have Twitter and you guys can enjoy that
with us and I have my phone is going
bananas like just absolutely bananas
because of all the all the tweets that
are that is experiencing right now there
we go all right so question number one
from Paul f could you beat up slick do
you think a slick could be a Seuss's JJ
in a straight-up fistfight
I would like to hear slick steak on this
I don't really I've seen JJ like twice I
don't think more in terms of like does
he have the mental toughness
think like a fighter haha I don't know I
don't know JJ I can't just say I'd be
able to beat some guy if I don't even
know I think you'd have the endurance he
would I think he would have the
endurance advantage because you're look
at how long JJ can talk about the least
interesting possible aspect of an asus
motherboard like I swear like 45 minutes
on like wonderful feature I think you
just have to keep hitting the guy he'd
be like was that fighter that would just
let you hit him until you retired you
many know if you I don't like I can't
remember
Kara's name but like that guy you think
he's like that style please
I think he's that style fighter because
I think that like his enthusiasm level
for like what he's doing like okay if he
wasn't interested in the fight I think
he could take you or I think you could
take him but if he was like passionate
about like like destroying you I think
he would just like just
I think he take it what might take like
an hour or three yeah like a three-hour
fight like if it was done in rounds and
there was like a I think you could get
him okay next next Twitter question for
the night what are your thoughts on the
hybrid fluid dynamic VGA coolers
honestly I don't think I've heard of
those hybrid fluid dynamic peachy colors
I haven't found any that I'm like what I
think they're basically like choc at the
camera though okay I haven't seen one in
a really long time but if I remember
correctly they're kind of like eight 100
hae that like like clothes like
watercolor style but it works for your
VGA oh you can see why I'm not oh yeah
those are Dumber yeah yeah those are
those are really expensive and they
perform better than obviously they
perform better than an air cooler on a
graphics card I mean the graphics card
form factors like PCI cards were never
intended to be like double triple wide
and have plate coolers on them it was
never never suppose I'm just gonna turn
my phone off because the the tweets are
driving me absolutely crazy there we go
phone because something right because
they were never designed to have coolers
in that kind of a sort of space like
coolers are supposed to blow fan air
towards something not like downed at its
surface and then sort of toward the back
of it doesn't make sense doesn't work
that way so so yeah they'd obviously be
better but you have a couple of
drawbacks so number one is that tubing
wise you have to have long tubing to get
that that cooler to somewhere in your
case that makes sense unless you have
and it's pretty much always going like
yeah that's coming from the bottom leg
upstream yeah so it'll be like a totem
that's that way then I mean personally
the graphics card isn't priority number
one for me for water cooling so then you
don't have room to mount your CPU
radiator plus yeah they're just they're
expensive they don't have a wide
compatibility they only work with one
card ever usually for the pricing that
I've seen I would much rather just do my
own loop yes that's right phone so I
don't really see them applicable that's
why I've never really been interested in
because in all situations your own loop
is awesome
but sometimes it's not worth the cost
then if you're gonna spend the cost on
something like that you might as well
but you're just gonna throw away when
you're done with that yeah when you can
just buy a new block for a loop and then
they're like if you get a new JavaScript
all right moving along you know our
Twitter questions here let's see what
else we got
Wilson asks how do you pronounce a soos
all right so hey soos yeah hey soos
ESU's as long as it's sous-sous like dr.
Seuss not likes us or not like Pegasus
so a lot of people have made the
argument to me on Twitter because I
posted a video made by made by Zeus
where they it's like a really cute
little thing where like two girls go up
to like two guys at a bar and they're
like hey do you want to see our asses we
love asses something like that and then
do you want to see them and the guys are
like yeah and they pull out notebooks
and their ACS notebooks so the guys are
like oh you mean a soos and the girls
are like oh yeah yeah so it's funny
because it's a soos is subtle way of
telling people stop pronouncing the name
of our company wrong just the song stop
doing it and I had a bunch of people
still arguing with me on Twitter no no
it's it's a sassy Asus Asus Pegasus and
because that's what it's learned from
because the company used to be called
Pegasus and you know it's you know it's
funny almost all of those guys had like
really cheeseball memes to start with
you know what dfi used to stand for
that's always been mystified okay well
at the end it was designed for
innovation now it's our before before
that it was Dimond flower international
let's like who calls third component
company diamond flower makes no sense LG
lights good
you know what that used to be right yeah
you told me it was something yeah lucky
gold star yeah it's like this is my
lucky gold star washer and dryer smiled
and you get like you know the a shine on
the gum the teeth it's like they know so
uh so yeah so so Asus change to
something that
didn't sound like a unicorn what a
pegasus is all right - it's like weird
question what our stylists made out of
BC I can't use any heat touch items I
use a head pointer to use gadgets I
think he means like Oh what our stylus
is made out of because I can't use any
heat touch items I use a head pointer to
use gadgets um okay well let's go with
the part of that question that I think I
can answer most styluses are made out of
plastic
there must be something different though
because if you just press a piece of
plastic against a stylus reactor screen
it doesn't go off okay they must mean
something else you know what I don't
know great question sorry we can't help
you sorry yeah Kelvin asks Linus what do
you think about WD red drives been
reading some reviews and some people
have do a for those of you who don't
know what that means it means dead on
arrival also can you review Western
Digital for terabyte black hard drive um
my thoughts on my thoughts on w red
drives is that we got four of them and
none of them were DOA also DOAs don't
necessarily indicate anything about the
quality of the product they can just
indicate that someone was unlucky let me
look at it this way if you make a
hundred thousand of something and a
hundred of them die you got a hundred
dead drives out there that seems like a
lot but in terms of the actual failure
rate that would be like socially pretty
good 0.1% yeah that's pretty good right
so even if a thousand of them died that
would be a one percent RMA rate but that
means because remember satisfied
customers whose hard drive is in their
computer just working they're not gonna
say anything most likely would you go on
a forum and talk about how your hard
drive works
no I've gone for us to talk about how
certain parts of works and how they've
worked really well but not a hard drive
not a hard drive definitely not okay cuz
if you did that I'd have to smack you
yeah yeah yeah okay yeah sorry guys cuz
you know it's funny every once in a
while like on the ncx forum we're like
hardware connects forum or whatever
someone comes in and they're like never
boss you good I bought three Seagate
hard drives and two of them died and I
don't think I've ever seen anyone come
on a farm and say buy Seagate hard
drives I have six and they're all alive
so guys you got to take every bit of
information you get with a grain of salt
it just doesn't work that way if
someone's like boy yuvigi a video card
died after two years of my work he was
only one year they screwed me it's like
no that's bad luck it's really bad luck
I mean if you'd registered your card
you'd have gotten one extra one year
warranty anyway but it's bad luck you
got a bad card it's not it's it doesn't
mean EVGA cards are terrible in fact
pretty much everyone's graphics cards
are especially reference cards pretty
much the same quality anyway so so yeah
I mean I get a kick out of it when
people who are like you know why rhis
cards more expensive they're like oh
they're better quality and I'm like okay
not the reference cards they're pretty
much the same for everybody although
some cards lightening classified like
ones where they're really over building
the card those ones are better someone's
asking you to post on Twitter that I'm
streaming at the moment but I can't
imagine that it didn't go to Twitter
when my YouTube video went live so I
don't know if that's live yet yeah it
looks like that's why there's a few
people that have looked at it and almost
oh that's funny
look at this people don't even like me
anymore this guy's like I almost tuned
out when you said slick wouldn't be on
cuz I was teasing them in the in the
teaser and I said slick wasn't gonna be
there because he was going to get our
food and and yeah apparently people
don't even like me anymore whatever you
guys don't have to take this and how
many years do you recommend upgrading
hardware won't you feel this one I
that's really subjective depends what
hardware you have talking about do more
things if it's a mechanical
get it okay if it's a mechanical
keyboard yeah remember if you're happy
with it never uh if it's those cheaters
things on it you may want to clean it
some kind of cookie words you can take
off he kept silent rid of your problem
which made me stop eating so many
cheetahs at your computer um yeah it
really depends what you have what device
it is when you're not satisfied anymore
is your computer slow are you lagging in
games are you below a certain acceptable
threshold of fps are you out of storage
you might want to buy another archive uh
or would something bacon new comes along
like SSDs are getting well below my
teller per gig right now especially on
Black Friday sales so if you don't have
an SSD yet now might be a good time to
buy that but as for like graphics cards
two CPUs it really depends what you have
to start with well that could lead us
into one of our discussion topics you
said okay fine I'm not telling you how
much RAM do you really need for gaming
not that much good question
okay yeah well how much does not that
much come on man hey gigs me buddy
eight gig kit for really really cheap
just buy that and you'll be fine I saw
them NCIX had 88 kits for $19.99 yeah
like ridiculously cheap just go with
that you'll be fine for Kimmy that's
more about the form you're working on
sure actually let's let's let's kick off
our first discussion topic then fine
okay do you want to do the other one
first the one that you said that was a
good lead-in to no that's fine we can do
the other one first it's okay no this
guy we pronounced this guy's name wrong
last time you're fired
for what it's worth I warned you I told
them I was gonna fire him on the line
she did Nate you did we promise this
guy's name wrong before he's I can't
remember if anyone knew Tweety's anyone
it's Greek or something hmm so bad 293
is back yes but it's not bad it will
always be bad to me
so you know what guys I want to involve
you in this part of the discussion he's
got a pen and paper this good series um
no no I'm not writing anything down I'm
actually writing down because I do those
here though I need to write down the
time 9 through 27
forum well yeah I wrote something down
but it's not because I'm writing down
what they're saying so what I'm writing
down is the the time codes that I put
under the video right so instead of
actually going through and watching the
video because quite frankly he's very
boring and I have a hard time watching a
show that has him on it also ugly I
don't know what you people say just
makes it a little bit easier for me to
put those in at the end so first of all
the choice of vbulletin so I had quite a
few people on Twitter asked me why
vbulletin because it costs 250 bucks
it is not free like pH P V and there's
some other options as well so question
answer number orchid okay know what I
want you guys filling in on the twitch
chat and Twitter right now is what you
guys want because there's a million
hardware forums like literally probably
a million hardware forums what do you
guys think would set apart a Linus tech
tips forum and I'd love to take your
feedback right now and maybe I will even
write some of it down no no I'll write
some of the time but we're both
listening we're both here and between me
and slick 99% of the work on the forum
and the conceptualization is going to be
done tell us what you want
so why vbulletin vbulletin was chosen
because I'm familiar with it
so I don't have to learn which is great
because I have to learn enough new
things to do my job and it's tiresome so
I don't have to learn wow that's a
really big factor number two is with
vbulletin 5 they have a pretty cool
content management system that's
completely integrated into the forum so
I want and you know reviews for example
unboxings I want to have a couple little
pictures I got a little short article I
want to have a way to drive traffic to
this site where people can really engage
in discussion beyond the YouTube
comments you
comments are fine and dandy but let's
face it for every sort of on YouTube in
general for every well-intentioned
coherent individual there's maybe 10
morons and I think that my videos bucked
that trend I think for every 10 coherent
individualist there's maybe one moron
but that doesn't change the fact that
there's still that guy reading it for
everyone and YouTube is the ultimate
mainstream platform where everyone has a
everyone watches videos on YouTube
absolutely everyone so I want to create
a forum where we can weed out the one
moron and we can just have really good
discussions about tech I also want it to
be a noob friendly forum I never ever
want to see a link to let me google that
for you not once
if I see a link to let me google that
for you I will ban you done because I
want this to be somewhere where you can
actually ask a question and get an
answer and have people be respectful to
each other so that's one problem that I
have with a lot of the old guard forums
so one that I particularly have taken
issue with over the years is a super
hardcore enthusiast forum based out of
the states where basically anyone who
goes there just gets treated like crap
especially particular sections where
people are not helpful they tell people
to you know go read the stickies or go
do this and I mean yeah people should
read stickies but you can also be polite
about explaining why stickies are there
and why you should read them and all
that kind of stuff you could point them
to the correct sticky for example so
there's ways to be polite about it so um
I don't slit what's what do you think we
can contribute that someone else doesn't
already cuz you're he's a huge ocm guy
yeah so what could we do that ocn
doesn't do for example um OSHA has its
own community and I think from the
livestream you guys talking in the
livestream you guys talking in the
comments you guys talking on our
Twitter's you guys commenting on each
other's posts on Twitter that happens a
lot sometimes I don't even have to
answer a question because there's a
couple guys that seem to go to my
Twitter a lot and just answer questions
for a week which is kind of cool um yeah
you want them to wipe your butt for
YouTube what like well this guy he's all
like oh yeah I don't even have to reply
to my own Twitter anymore
it's cool because they like it's my view
bass knows what they're talking but I'll
even pay you for I think it would be
cool to have somewhere for everyone to
come together and talk about things
amongst our community so I think that's
pretty cool
I think it'd be cool for everyone to
show their own build logs and like we
should definitely have a bill log
section and you can be like oh like if
you're new you can go like oh I got to
this part my bill but I'm having
problems with this and then instead of
just being it being like bill logs were
it's just epic and baller that's awesome
but I think the bill dog could also be a
helpful section right could be like look
at this this is weird what am i doing
why is it wrong how is my cable manage
my cable management is there any
suggestions for how I have this laid out
is its water loop good how is this going
bah bah bah bah bah it could be more of
a helpful helpful space like that would
be good I mean other things I think that
we can do with a forum that are really
difficult to do with Twitter and
Facebook is we can take we can take
feedback from more complicated things a
lot more easily yep so thank you milady
oh my goodness I get so many questions
on Twitter that like if I answered it it
would I would have to spam you like nine
times because 140 characters is just not
enough so many of the times it's really
frustrating I get questions all the time
where I'm just like this is not like
this is not the right medium for this
question I can't do this properly right
now Twitter doesn't have adequate ways
like for example I try to answer the
vast majority of my tweets and Twitter
doesn't have good tools to show you like
HootSuite is a piece of garbage I don't
even get me started on HootSuite what a
horrible piece of software considering
the company's worth like millions and
millions now how are they worth millions
of dollars they make one piece of
software for one social network that
anyway um so there's no way to track
whether you've replied to something or
not yeah it earlier I can't find it
again yes there's no way to find stuff
this search just doesn't work yeah at
all yeah like you might as well key in
Google tweet about something and like
try to remember something about it
because that's the best chance you have
of finding that tweet so a forum would
be a way for me to actually
prioritize and keep track of messages I
mean YouTube YouTube private messages
are another example that's where I'd
love to reply to YouTube private
messages but honestly it's just stupid
and it's a waste of my time because of a
couple things at least 30% of people on
YouTube have the private message block
enabled so unless you're on their
contact list
you can't private message them so
they'll message me and then I'll type
out a reply for 10 minutes and then I'll
extend and they have it blocked and I'm
like you know what that's a waste of my
time it just is and then the other thing
is it doesn't it doesn't um it doesn't
archive the previous parts of a
conversation below your message I get so
many private messages on YouTube
I might have to go back five pages to
find the original message you sent me
and then figure out what I replied and
then find your new message just to
figure out what you're even talking
about because people will be like oh so
still don't say something like oh I
guess I'm shopping for a monitor what's
your suggestion and I'll send back this
and then they'll say oh well what about
this meanwhile have no idea what I
suggested or what they originally asked
me or what it's for and it's just not
helpful so a forum would be a great
thing for that any other sort of off the
top of your head before we get to some
tweets um no I like the bell dog idea a
lot of course I want house build bugs
but I wanted to be more helpful based
and I know a lot of people have helpful
kind of build logs but I just I don't
know I think that would be cool and just
bringing the community together one
place one yeah one place instead of
having all like of course these other
different mediums will keep flowing but
having a more permanent kind of housing
for everything would be really cool and
just so you guys know I don't have any
intention at this time to put
advertising on the forum so just if
you're if you care about that it's not
something that I'll be trying to that
I'll be trying to monetize it anyway oh
wow 203 tweets awesome I in-depth
tutorials at - yeah yeah like like a lot
of people asked for the mineral oil guy
mineral oil cooling guide and I'd still
don't think we'll do that but if we
could have a section on the forum where
people could ask more specific questions
instead of just the general how do I
a little computer because there's yeah
I'm just not gonna get into it but if
you have like more specific questions or
have any questions at all you can ask
them there and then I could like take my
time and absolutely flush out answers
that make sense you know what here's
something I want to do a little bit
differently from other guys as well a
lot of forms have level up systems and
they'll have rankings for their users on
the - tech tips forum rather than it
being pasted on how many posts or being
based on sort of anything honestly guys
I think that every level up in terms of
your user status will be yeah none of
them will be it won't be a paid level up
you can't pay for a level up you might
be able to pay for you know a custom
avatar or something something something
it does cost money to run a forum but I
think every level up will actually be
assigned by me or slick and I don't know
if I've talked to you about this at all
yet nope but what I want to do is I want
to have rankings for people based on
really I mean we'll both be monitoring
the forum very regularly so I want to
have rankings that are based on are you
contributing how accurate is your advice
I don't want someone on our forum to
have a tag that says Top Contributor
when that's just based on replying +1 or
whatever else I want it to be based on
oh I saw that guy and make a really good
reply to someone I'd go and check his
post history I make sure all the advice
he's giving is accurate and awesome and
all that kind of stuff and then I can
put like a like a - approved advice seal
next today's post we should have
individual ones and yes - approved slick
approved diesel approves yeah so we can
do multiple tiers of rankings so that we
can find a way to really differentiate
no matter how many posts you've made or
haven't made really differentiate the
people who we see as top contributors
right from the very start so you come in
you make ten posts and they're awesome I
would love to give you a better ranking
even though you haven't made a lot of
posts you haven't been a member for a
long time so that's another way where I
want to be really friendly to new
members especially guys who are willing
to be helpful we should we should we
should have that but I think there might
also be room for it like like seals like
those could be seals I don't know
but I think we should get your input
from this too but we could have like
seals like no like the Linus seal of
excellence or like the slick seal of
excellence or whatever I still want to
start the League of Linus yeah well kind
of already dating but whatever man
all right thank you for coming your
commitment I love your videos and stick
thank you
it's like a we're gonna have his own
YouTube channel heaven forbid so ugly I
have to cover it up in the library at
this guy huh it's like Linus seems to
make fun of you a lot have you ever
considered pimp slapping him it happens
but really I'll be doing an unboxing of
that microphone soon a Seuss for sure
yeah you know what here's the thing
about subreddit subreddit will never
have direct control over will never be
able to label our top contributors will
never be able said thank you know you
you get like you could be a model
okay why am i driving traffic to their
website I know I'm just saying I'm just
saying yeah um I cruise around I'm not
gonna give up my username but I cruise
around build a PC and keyboards and a
bunch of other tech based subreddits
it's pretty much all the sub rates that
I follow or deck lease oh goodness but I
I cruise around and I post again I'm not
gonna say my name but I've never heard
of of X here my random choices are
Kingston core fare
so no muskan gee spilled yeah never
heard of a mixer sorry hmm yeah that's
probably a graphics card upgrade that'll
help you the most no one is talking are
you guys serious ah Knicks missing the
livestream because he's only on he's on
4G - platform profit no we're not
actually planning to profit from the
forum but thank you I think he means
profit is it like this is a good idea
that that's what a profit in financial
ways oh I get it
okay nice teamliquid sweatshirt slick
foods if they're asking what is around
just send those
link to Wikipedia yeah don't that well
no one asks what brand is though um okay
so colors color schemes use neutral
colors on the background so text is easy
to read okay that's actually those are
those are all that's all good input I'll
look into that Michael wants a test of
knowledge to join acts to join the forum
Michael you are automatically been I
think that was the point of making it
noob friendly yeah there isn't a test of
no there's no test we want everyone to
be welcome at the Linus tech tips farm
except people who are sort of what's it
called lowest yeah mmm acknowledging
someone who knows a lot isn't a bad idea
but just try I think it's more thrashing
on people that we're trying to stay away
from you haven't a to user rating system
yet for sure no we're not automatically
banning anyone who requests to build
with them and put it all but what we
will have is a sticky saying what
information we do need and then we can
refer them to that yeah we're definitely
gonna skin it I don't know how much work
we're gonna be able to put into the skin
cuz like I said I'm not planning to make
it ad monetized so we're not gonna have
a lot of money to spend on like graphic
design and I don't think slick is very
good I am probably ranking within the
worst artists that have ever been born
onto this planet and I'm probably gonna
be the one and we are one of us will
probably be the ones that make the skin
so no easel can help looking out oh I'll
try and find a template and hopefully
diesel can help but in the early early
build which I'm hopefully gonna be doing
this weekend really hopefully oh well
there you go that is what I pay him for
it not as bad as that but hopefully
doing this weekend I don't entirely know
if it'll go live but it'll be running on
my computer in the very early build and
once it's probably the first version
that goes live will probably not look
insanely pretty but we'll work on it
okay well Maldon things be bulletins
just fine I should devote a forum just
to stalking you I'm absolutely not
building a PC versus NCIX building one
or hacking dog versus a Mac Pro build a
hackintosh don't like
an AK just make sure the hardware is
compatible as for building a PC this is
having NCIX do it it doesn't it doesn't
matter if you're lazy then you can have
NCIX build it the additional benefit is
they'll do a one-year warranty on the on
the system itself it's honestly not that
expensive I've got a buddy that every
computer that he gets me like he
definitely knows how to build computers
but every computer that he gets he uh he
gets it built by Intex because he's just
way too lazy to build it himself um
Michael get the H 100 I that one's new
newark okay so we're not actually seeing
that much feedback about the forum let's
go back up to the top let's see if some
of these 121 new interact all so if we
have a forum I can post like the
documentation from my benchmarking oh
yeah that'd be kind of neat yeah so
stuff that doesn't make it into the
videos the actual spreadsheet so people
can actually see it stuff like right so
people I can load it and manipulate it
themselves and whatnot so you don't just
have to see a video version of it so
I'll be kind of cool
Oh was a good point okay mm-hm I didn't
see the guys name but someone said that
Jason asked when we when we plan on
launching and obviously soon okay so I
think we spent enough time on this topic
we can go back and have a look at some
of these tweets after um you know what
have a look at some of your some of your
topic suggestions for tonight let's do
some more just general why don't we give
the twitch chat some love let's see what
they want to know these guys go so fast
I can never well there's a good
suggestion C let someone make a forums
gonna make a contest out of it I mean
the thing I don't like about contests
sometimes it's just because one always
gets hurt someone's feelings always get
hurt no matter what someone's feelings
are always hurt um like like if someone
makes something for you no matter what
it is if you don't like it for whatever
reason they like even if it's
incompatible or if there's like some
weird reason that isn't necessary that
you don't like it but you can't use it
for some reason
it'll always hurt that person so making
a contest we only get to use one
yeah like it's not like the Coursera
keyboard video where we're like yeah
we're gonna give away five keyboards
except we're gonna give away seven
keyboards and like 35 versions of
Assassin's Creed because we're
ridiculous I don't know why would this
not be coming you know that it's not
amazing I drop my team iris though so
I'm super not thrilled about that
stretching desert Merc I don't know this
check so I had some note looks like it's
okay so I had someone ask about the
status of my personal build so here it
is um as you can plainly see there is no
status update so here's my t-virus
here put the t-virus down here's the rig
okay so basically I've actually
unprogressive out it so you can see my
590 is covered in drywall dust because
it was in the yeah that's really not
good like I have no idea how I'm gonna
clean it now my CPU socket is now empty
cuz I had to borrow the CPU for
something and then my and then two of my
RAM sticks are gone because one of these
one of my - edition RAM sticks that was
in my wife's computer died oh yeah I'm
super not thrilled so now I have five
sticks take the spreaders off you can't
trust me the adhesive you'd bend them
before you'd get them off and they're
there to pieces there's an outside piece
and an unrepeatable it gets to trust me
it's not gonna work if you can add some
other round I could put them on the back
so yeah I took two of those out below I
got my raid card wired up correctly now
and I've got a list in here of all the
additional things that I still need to
to do in terms of cutting things and all
that so really there's probably only
about eight hours of work left in it but
I spent so much time on upgrading the
studio that I'm putting in the garage
and I just haven't had any time to spend
on this so yeah between that and the
baby it just really really Twitter
question
or twitch someone say something on
twitch my god it's so quick I actually
can't read people say hi slick chicken
nuggets potato starcraft2
cannot sleep you even lift
show us your lifting here you go dude
can't do it the t-value can't lift
decisiveness two bars is too heavy too
heavy it's it's the weight of how great
it is I know I just know I know and my
first topic which I don't think will
take very long a glossy versus matte and
why it's important lossy versus Matt
okay here we go hold on let me write
this down okay we're ready okay so I've
been looking through Black Friday sales
as long as I mean the same is a bet a
lot of you have I've been looking for a
new monitor and I just there's a couple
really good options and a couple of the
really good options are glossy and I
just can't do it I can't bring myself a
bike loss tomorrow okay we should
clarify it
glossy screamed Gazi bezel hace bezel
glossy bezel okay
I like matte screen tubes they don't get
glare problems but then I usually just
blackout blind by room really yeah and
then you get your bag of Cheetos I'm
that guy i black out blended most rooms
that I've been in um where I am right
now it's not as easy but I have
seriously I have curtains black coupons
pukka boys my parents place is horrible
because there's there's a huge double
like sliding glass door behind me
so you black outline I did not like a
woman okay I'm not go by my room I don't
like a slick moves out and has his own
I hope I can fly to everything it will
be a dungeon
okay okay I'll let go blanket for you
but you'd put your computer in the
basement if you had one yes so you'd be
like so so you have to have a nerd
dungeon
you'd be one step above living in your
mom's basement I definitely want like
one of my dreams for when I move out is
like the best most epic nerd dungeon
ever like I want arcade machines are
Kings know what our team is yeah any
idea how expensive those are they're
quite a bit but you make your home yeah
but I can tell you you can't afford to
make your own because I know how much I
pay you
you're not gonna work for me forever
you can be more sweet um you can make
your own fairly easily actually
especially with a lot of the like ITX
there's like main emulators and stuff
right yeah that's a legit though you
have to have a legit pinball machine and
like a legit like yeah I'm like I would
want those I would really really want
those but at the beginning I would
probably kind of just know that's just
because if you settle then you'll never
upgrade it I don't know because you'd
have to like you don't want to find like
the one that some dude has just had
forever and doesn't take care of it and
just like uses it as like something to
put his beer on like you don't want that
no you find a blacklight yeah go over it
if it's clean it's okay but like I mean
like dents oh I got myself like I would
want one that's still in good condition
without dance well brutal where are you
gonna find that brutal dance there's a
there's a like Museum kind of thing down
in the States
no no they help you they help you find
them they help you find them from the
museum steal priceless artifacts don't
steal arcade thinking small here
I'd much rather arcade machine Minister
I'm gonna let you finish by Beyonce had
the best album and your trash how did we
get here from travel I'll see your
singing is trash compared to Beyonce I
heard you sing how did we get here I
think we started with velocity versus
now we'd better monitor okay so let me
put it this way
I mean I don't own a single glossy
monitor new Droid my TV has a glossy
bezel as you can see yeah however my TV
was a wedding present and as we
discussed before there's no way to
reject a wedding present I'm afraid I
cannot accept this 52 inch television
has my wedding yeah so yeah pay
attention when you're buying one of
these unless you just don't care but I
would highly suggest making sure you get
one with the map ISM you know what a lot
of people what like okay cuz in theory
you should never touch it so why does it
matter but it collects dust more easily
mm-hmm just generally looks dirty and
you're gonna move it from time to time I
think the biggest problem for me with
glossy surfaces is that unlike paint
like paint the glossy earth are more
durable i'm easier it is to clean but it
seems like with plastic the glossy ER it
is the easier it is to scratch up and
destroy yeah yeah it just looks like
crap over time like you can you can see
idea pads think books the IBM laptop
yeah like super generally they're always
pink books something yeah they're always
like matte everywhere and even if
they're super super old like my grandma
has one that she's had for a really long
time she got it with Windows 95
originally and it's like still a super
old I keep it as a comp or so I can plug
it into like old things anyways it's all
matte and I bet you stole from the
museum
okay we got her a new computer and then
she didn't want that one so she's gonna
get rid of it so I took it so I can play
many things with the comport anyways um
it's it's Matt everywhere and it still
looks new except for the fact that it's
like an attic but like all the plastics
still look new because it's all matte
and great yeah will like Blackie great
but yeah you know what a lot of people
message me about you know those cheapo
Korean monitors on eBay
yeah so you can get 2560 by 1440 like
IPS I think they're usually a - green
panels LG IPS a - great panels lots of
different monitors lots of different IDs
for those of you don't know ID refers to
industrial design so it's like the
design of the product what it looks like
so I was looking at them yesterday lots
of options so they got ones with just
DVI in they've got ones where you can
supposedly overclock the panel to faster
than 60 Hertz no seriously I believe it
I'm just surprised
they bought ones where they've got lots
of different inputs they've got like
tons of different options not a single
one of them has an that bezel yeah I was
not surprised
I expect I expected that and I'm not
really that surprised I don't know this
glossy just seems like the go-to and I
have no idea because it looks good in a
story looks good on display and it's not
it gets dusty instantly in a store the
same way what they clean it every single
night yeah in theory your magical story
I'm just saying but like I don't know
look good in pictures yeah it looks good
in renders because it pictures it's
impossible not to catch the line right
exactly or like edited photos but like
it's it's more of a sales pitchy kind of
thing not a I've used this kind of thing
before that had a glossy surface and I
hated it
okay here's what I want to know does it
cost that much more to make a matte
bezel i I don't know when I first
started seeing like when when glossy
started being really popular I was
actually surprised because I assumed it
cost more it looks like it would cost
more I don't know I have no idea I know
they have to put more protective crap on
yeah because they always seemed like
seal it yeah they always have to seal
so there's probably tooling involved in
something to do with that or like some
kind of dye to cut out the plastic and
but it someone has to put it on yeah
yeah I don't know I just well it's
probably machine but your machine and
you're wearing green let's hope not
machine well I didn't say you were the
Hulk
you said machines man yeah doesn't say
machines man no he doesn't but you're a
machine not Hulk the machine has to be
green a bunch of people on YouTube
telling me is hot and now he thinks he's
like huh that wasn't the point why did
you why did what does machine have to be
green your name isn't Bruce Banner Bruce
Banner except that I'd be dead right now
I'm glad you not know remember it from
Avengers he's always angry and can
control it so you wouldn't be dead right
now cuz you pay me but you've never
necessarily like hulked before so maybe
this would be the first time and you
wouldn't have control cuz you're still
young right
yeah he's younger than me like a lot
younger even though he's much larger
eleventeen is not a number on a previous
stream someone asked me how old I was
and I said 11 teen and then someone
thought I was Ashley eleventeen hello I
have a question for the twitch chat
we're going to put chat right now twitch
chat twitch chat tell me something like
this tell me if there's anyone who
actually prefers a glossy bezel come on
guys tell me what we got who prefers a
glossy bezel yes I love no no no no no
yes I saw one yes I saw one I prefer
glossy people say largely but it doesn't
matter twitch chat is just impossible to
follow yeah but people complain when I
put it on slow mode this is the problem
with having 2,000 people watching
alright back to Twitter because twitch
chat is impossible I love you guys but
it's impossible oh this is interesting
synapse 2.0 apparently got an update so
now when you lose the internet it goes
into offline mode so you
so use your key bindings so what's your
take on on synapse now so synapses razor
software that allows you to use the
cloud to back up all your preferences
for your peripherals and stuff
let's I'm okay with it okay those my
only real problem there we go if you fix
my only real problem that's okay I I'm
surprised they overbooked it but it that
seemed like it was fixed pretty quickly
okay so that's cool I'm cool with that
I have not seen the msi empower ram
although I suspect it's RAM just like
all other Ram um huh Clinton says I have
a $5 capture card and a $90 one they
both look the crap what do you suggest
as an alternate composite video capture
card not HDMI Oh honestly I don't have
many suggestions adapter off of what
yeah but there'll have to be some kind
of a gap like there have to be it'll
have to be an active adapter well the
live gamer HD can adapter off we were
doing DVI and DVI we weren't doing HDMI
HDMI I don't know but that's composite
that's an analog signal yeah no no no
the Blackmagic intensity Pro does do
composite like it's a $200 capture card
but it's a professional-grade capture
card and it's really volatile and then
well yeah and it causes blue screen
adjust voice dies constantly well know
if you have it in the right motherboard
it doesn't die constantly right if
anyone's wondering why we have the kinds
of technical difficulties we do.thank
nothing ever works we get pre-release
stuff we get niche stuff beta drivers a
the drivers we're always running
ridiculously like state-of-the-art stuff
that like thing a works thing B works
but thing a plus B just explosion cuz
usually if if we have a video about it
if it's on release and we released the
video on release we probably filmed it a
really long time ago when they were
still like you couldn't download the
drivers for it it came on like some
unlabeled discs or someone wrote with a
marker like beta driver and then what
number like it's usually pretty pretty
sketchy so I remember there was one
motherboard where I was getting driver
updates in my inbox like every two days
yeah
and I was like what is the point of me
even starting to test this platform if
they're sending me new driver releases
every two days that will completely
invalidate or not driver a BIOS release
that will completely invalidate
everything I already ran yes why would I
even bother to start on this and that
happened all the way up till about three
days from release and I'm like what
about all the motherboards you've
already built are they shipping with the
BIOS that's not good enough not naming
any names for anything but just you know
a lot of you know you guys asked me a
lot of the time - why don't you ever
recommend this brand or ever recommend
this thing I assume there's a reason
let's just put it that way
assume I know and assume there's a
reason okay
people could submit their own reviews
that can be voted up in a database that
would be kind of fun as a forum idea
it'll be cool because we can't see
everything yeah oh it's a good Sandy
Bridge upgrade you know what here let's
go into let's go into another and let's
go to another topic why don't you guys
why don't you get a topic for us okay
this actually builds into what you were
just talking about brand favoritism ah
yes
people ask why I suggest ducky keyboards
Allah say okay this one's not even
that's only brand favoritism I've had
quite a few people go like oh I see you
suggest a lot of keyboards on Twitter
why are they all duckies it's because
99% of the people that asked me for a
keyboard on Twitter are asking for a
keyboard with backlights a mechanical
keyboard with backlight so if you don't
want a very specific colored backlight
and it's mechanical keep like if you
want a blue backlight there's three
options yeah I think that's pretty much
it if you want a back white backlight
there's two options and if you want any
other color there's one option so oh
Coolermaster has some more now as well
actually
Lumos movie I think they have some
backlit ones quick-fire something
something there's one in the mail to us
but it's shipped by USPS so it'll get
here when it does whenever it feels like
it yeah yeah okay well that's cool but
like the reason why I suggest a lot of
Ducky's is like in my opinion it's like
ducky in Kokomo or like the legit like
top tier keyboard that's just completely
out
g7 10-plus really really good I don't
have enough usage with it yet personally
because I've typed on it like three
seconds okay so really decide okay I'll
give you that um but Logitech as far as
actually like software goes is legit way
better than anyone else Logitech could
blast up there I believe in Logitech
seven ten plus but you can but okay here
and then this is tweet wait until they
come up with one with blue searches
that's my whole thing I know I'm a blue
switch guy so for me to really really
like something it's gonna be blue so you
can see what am i what am i doing for
tweet okay
this tweet is everything that's wrong
with like PC enthusiasts so I got a
tweet from someone I'm not gonna name
any names at - tech I really don't like
Apple if I get an iPad iPhone iPod I
whatever then I would sell it directly
because it is the worst OS ever with two
R's and five exclamation marks so let me
put it this way cuz I was making I was
making a point
I'm not a fan of anything I'm not some
kind of zealot I have an iPhone I chose
the iPhone because it was the best
choice at the time Android was still in
the gingerbread stage which was rubbish
and the devices out there were not very
good so I got an iPhone poor Android
devices are way better now with stuff
like the galaxy s3 being the selling
gastón ever and so yeah ever right yeah
I was just gonna bring up the Nexus 4
that's all though just like oh yeah
Nexus 4 I might you know come up on it
but I mean everybody's been out for so
long oh yeah I know I'm just saying like
like Android selling Android in general
is selling like hotcakes right now so
the point I was trying to make is that
iPhone is a great phone that's it it's
not open for debate
they've sold millions and millions and
millions and millions and there's lots
of happy happy happy happy customers
just because it's not good for you
because someone was saying that it's the
worst the worst OS ever really worse
than Windows ME and now I'm just I mean
I'm just picking on Microsoft is it
worse than
windows 95 actually 95 is okay I'm not
gonna pick on 95 was it worse than I
mean I personally liked this stuff but
in your mind it wasn't worse than Vista
i okay you see my point here right yeah
we talking about this in the car and
like you guys all know I fight for
Android and I will continue to fight for
Android but if my grandpa asked for a
phone
why would I suggest Android that doesn't
seem like a good idea that seems like a
terrible idea I want something that he
can grab it and it will be set up
immediately and he wants to do anything
with it and you can just send emails and
send text messages and call people so
the point is that if it's not great for
you that doesn't mean it might not be
great for someone that doesn't mean it
sucks
yeah my mom my mom has a non smartphone
Android and I wish I would have just
gotten here to get an iPhone because she
constantly struggles with it because
like very simple cues she doesn't really
pick up on all the time um which like
very simple to me
but iPhone seems a lot more intuitive
for her usage scenario so depends what
usage scenario being for so it might be
the worst os ever to you but it's not
necessarily the worst os ever everyone
else again in my opinion for me
especially infra I think probably a vast
majority of our viewers Android will
probably suit you better but that
doesn't mean that iOS is inherently bad
no like okay Apple Maps is bad okay but
but I'm still managed to avoid updating
to iOS 6 right so there then okay so so
fanboy ISM in general is terrible and I
just want to put it this way being a
zealot of anything makes you lame what
do you do that I'll just bring it up
okay oh but in cases where it kind of
makes sense is when they have like great
support there great warranty so you can
like the brand because of their how much
they will help you but then if their
products suck that's not gonna help so
you should look at the individual
products and then if you find two equals
go with a brand that you know has
awesome support but that's not being a
zealot like being a zealot is supporting
something that's just that we just know
is bad I mean something like okay
honestly you know what anyway
who bought an original pentium for
Extreme Edition tune out now just tune
out now stop watching go away I don't
want to talk to you anymore because it
was an obviously inferior product I mean
you're probably a little bit too young
for this right here I I was not crazy
okay the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition I
think it was the 925 X II was the first
one I think I could be wrong
terrible product it ran so hot and it
was so slow compared to the FX chip that
it was up against which would have been
the FX 51 or 53 or something along those
lines the FX and II started this whole
thousand-dollar desktop processor thing
and like guys you know if you think any
you know if you're all like blah blah
blah you know AMD loves the consumer
that's why they have two hundred dollar
processor and he has two hundred dollar
processors because that's so much people
will pay for their processors when they
thought they could get a thousand bucks
for a chip they were all over that like
white on rice
they were they started this whole
Extreme Edition thing that Intel
continues to do so it was a just
horrible product compared to what little
else was out there people bought it I
know that people bought it so that to me
is being a zealot
because AMD and Intel both have a long
track record of good reliability blah
blah not all that good stuff except we
know that they cost the same and we knew
that the extreme edition was
dramatically slower and otherwise equal
in every possible way
we'd have hyper threading but it was
still slower so it doesn't matter
yeah like that's that's what I need them
but like like let's talk video cards
maybe like 1900 this was reskin which
ones that 9800 that doesn't have to do
with brand favoritism but that's like it
was a reskin and a lot of people see I
don't even invite him to these things
it's just so that you guys can like look
at him but a lot of people would upgrade
to it just because they believed look at
how much its new from its I knew a lot
of people that didn't really yeah oh but
they're like oh it's new I haven't 8800
DTX my 8800 GT exits
good and it's Nvidia so Nvidia came with
something new that means it's obviously
awesome I should upgrade ok ok ok so I
see that you means I'm faith and brands
blind blind upgrading when you actually
don't need it because you have that
blind faith in that elitism so that's
something like read review apple zombie
syndrome yeah yeah oh my god
new iPad I have no idea what just
happened but I'm gonna buy one see
that's another thing guys like you guys
give me a really hard time for owning an
iPhone I don't own an iPhone 5
I don't own a 4s I didn't own a 3d yes
and I didn't own whatever what came
before that was no just three 3G I
didn't own a 3G and I didn't own an
iPhone I have owned one iPhone ever
because my company said we're getting
you a phone what do you want so I picked
this that was it I know I have actually
only spent money on an Apple product
once in my life and it was when I
dropped my keys on my iPad and I cracked
the screen and it was I think it was
$200 to get a brand-new iPad from the
store because it was under warranty or
something so I didn't even buy my iPad I
just replaced it when it was broken for
it so that was the I was the only time
so so guys I don't oh yeah here's
another one has anyone ever told - that
you look like Eminem I actually get that
a lot and I don't see it do you see it
no doesn't matter no no yeah see guys no
I get it a lot though white guy with
blond hair is that like is that what
they're seeing
well I dyed my hair blonde ones but it's
like blonde - yeah I don't think he's a
straight one I don't really know yeah
whatever I already see it okay uh you
know what this is this is a question
that's gonna lead us into another
discussion topic so discussion topic for
right now is him stop asking me what is
the best monitor stop asking me what is
the best case stop asking me what is the
best Mouse stop asking me what is the
best keyboard I could go on for a while
if it's something that's subjective I
cannot tell you you can
asked me I mean even I I sent out this
tweet earlier and I had a lot of people
tweet back at me and go will Linus what
they really mean to ask you is what are
you using to which I would reply it's
probably not relevant because what I'm
using for example for my monitor is a
305 T plus from Samsung you can't buy it
it's discontinued so what am I gonna do
I'm not gonna recommend it because you
can't buy it in fact same thing goes for
my mouse people ask me well what's the
best Mouse and I'll say this and this
and they'll say oh well what most do you
use and I say well I using a carry laser
good luck trying to buy one because
they're dead
no well they're not dead they still work
might work they're hard to find but you
can't find them anymore
so um if you want to ask a question like
what is the best monitor ask me a
question like what is the best monitor
for gaming refresh rate is most
important to me or color is most
important to me because what happens is
I end up asking having to ask probing
questions and what happens on Twitter if
I have to ask you so if you said me so
here let's simulate this ask me a
question what is the best keyboard what
is your keyboard for gaming do you need
macro keys or not no do you type a lot
yes okay go with a - keyboard what
switches they both have please oh okay
but don't be a smart guy so my point is
I don't see every tweet if we have to go
back and forth four times you're never
gonna get an answer so don't ask me -
can you configure a PC for me you know
what go on and see I XCOM go to buy a PC
and then find a computer and then say -
is this a good computer or what would
you change and then I can send you a
summary and slick can do the same thing
he's super technical - what would you
change we'll go oh well you know
downgrade mess upgrade this you can hit
approximately that same price point get
10% better performance but if you're
just like Linus I'm not willing to put
the work into it what should I get for
custom water cooling I'm gonna say look
man this is Twitter I have 140
characters to tell you a full custom
water cooling loop I don't know what
case you have I don't know what CPU
socket you're using I don't know what
graphic
card you have I don't know if you Eve a
lot of water cool your graphics I don't
know what your budget is like we want to
help you but it's a lot better if you
give us like like these are very
specifically what I want or like like
not smoothing okay saying I want a great
gaming keyboard with blue backlight like
that house we can help you that helps a
lot but if it's like what's the best
keyboard it's way too general what's the
best keyboard I don't know what you tell
me what do you use I well it has a wire
I don't like wires I'm not wireless do
mechanical switches inherently use more
power why don't we have any wireless
mechanical keyboards cuz wireless
keyboards are okay the whole like
mindset of having a mechanical keyboard
goes against the like latency issues
that are inherited by a wired by a wire
they add a very low latency wireless um
you couldn't like you can yourself make
using like wireless dongles and whatnot
you could make you'd end up with like
big okay people want wireless because
they want something elegant not because
they write son Frank can keep like wires
coming out of it here and like screws
throw like random USB dongle just like
shooting out of the back yeah that's
still a wire I'm just saying no I mean
like the stick just this thing it's just
like uber low latency Enki rollover like
all this kind of stuff is the whole
mindset is mechanical so why would you
go wireless
you know why would you have a mechanical
keyboard for your like Media PC well
yeah but I don't maybe I just don't like
maybe I want to have a great typing
experience and I don't want wait worse
something wrong with that I just the
markets not there is my I guess I would
have thought but there might also be
another reason but I'm not a machine I
would have thought the market wasn't
there for mechanical keyboards in
general but we've got at least like
three or four like this entire forums
dedicated to well yeah exactly but it's
still a nice thing
comparatively speaking compared to
membranes be key words like memory
it's totally nice yeah it's becoming
more popular though Logitech's embraced
it someone must have a wireless keyboard
at some point like you gotta think you
know at some point
some of this came from some of this came
from a tweak and I got that was oh yeah
another thing guys is if you've already
googled it and you already can't find it
like the odds are excellent that if you
google like you know 120 Hertz monitor
with great viewing angles and you
couldn't find anything like that
the odds are excellent because it
doesn't exist and tweeting me about it
actually won't help so I had someone
tweet me do you know what 120 Hertz
monitor with great viewing angles or at
least better than average and the answer
is no because 120 Hertz monitors are all
using TN panels they're using TN panels
that are overclocked like mad in order
to get the pixels to switch fast enough
between color and a and color B in order
to keep up with that 120 Hertz refresh
rate TN monitors have rubbish viewing
angles rubbish colour reproduction and
rubbish color death that's just all
there is to it however they are much
much faster than VA IPS or pls panels
which is good for gaming however I
personally prefer my 305 t plus for
gaming it's a VA panel it's slow as heck
I can see the motion blur but it doesn't
bother me that much
input lag is very discerning ballif I
have anti-aliasing on so I keep it off I
like the high resolution the deep colors
and the accurate colors that enhances my
gaming experience so you might go okay
Linus I'm not gonna ask you what's the
best monitor but I'll ask you what's the
best gaming monitor to which I would go
I don't know man you want resolution you
want color accuracy you want color depth
you want speed I don't know you want 3d
these are all I get this brings up the
forum thing again these are all a lot
better a lot better questions for a
forum yes we can't we don't have the
typing space to deal with it in Twitter
I think that's more what he's
complaining about you know what we need
in the farm we need like a section with
like slicks pics yeah and like Linus's I
don't know
there's nothing that catchy Slick's pics
is way better well it sounds like it
sounds like you know like slick sticks
I don't know huh oh my goodness no
double meaning
slick specs where I try to take pictures
of you picking your nose
so it's pics of his pics and their
slicks Wow no that shouldn't be an
entire farm section no I don't think so
okay then let's go back to let's go back
to more topics that I had sort of oh
yeah here okay
riddle me this why do people buy phones
without a contract
um this tweets point no no don't worry
about that one this one just that yeah
why why would you buy a phone without a
contract riddle me this like phones are
like $600 it's a lot of money I think
you're already on a contract you just
switch what phone using okay so like if
someone had why are you switching your
phone cuz you want to do I wouldn't I'm
just trying to I'm playing devil's
advocate I'm trying to fight for the
guys that do like I've got a friend of
school that really really wanted the
Nexus for I don't know what he has right
now but he really really wanted a Nexus
4 so he was waiting to buy a nexus 4
online he already has a contract he just
wanted a new phone you and me aren't I
like I like Android and I play around my
Android but I'm definitely not as crazy
as well one of my friends other than
that pretty much the crazy star group
but like some of the guys a follow me on
Twitter of commented on stuff that's a
little bit over my head and I've looked
it up and figured it out but yeah but
like if you're a phone advocate it might
be worth for you to buy a new phone
you're just buying a new piece of
technology okay I'm sure they know it's
not what the but the release cycles on
them they're so fast that's true what
like if you if you have the money to
spend and that's what you're really into
then why not I would make the argument
that any phone from the last couple
years is a phone already already does
pretty much anything that you could
possibly need okay tell me what you can
do with your Nexus
whatever that thing is Galaxy s3 that
you couldn't do with your Nexus S a lot
of the games a lot of the games on my
Nexus S with like emulators emulators
would like some of the higher-end
emulators would like this is just
generally faster okay which it has a way
nicer even though I had jellybean on my
Nexus S this one's jelly being due to
its hardware advancements is a lot
snappier a lot faster and a lot more
fluid and I can go from like playing a
game I can be in the middle of a playing
a game and just like tap home button and
just send an email and jump back into
the game on my Nexus S would be like tap
home button Oh God the game has to like
decide that it's quitting now okay see
this is yet another like iOS thing I'm
kind of spoiled I don't have what like
there's no there's no lag I can exit the
game and then go do something else and
go back yeah but I'm talking about
pretty intense games not angry buddies
what's an intense game on a phone though
they have higher end games like blade
whatever Infinity Blade I don't know
Infinity Blade supposed okay no that was
a long time ago only games I have on my
phone are from Humble Bundle okay okay
well I'll fine you've made your point
okay I kind of understand I mean it's
been a long time it's just not really
your thing
yes phones are not my thing yeah so like
you you can't hate on someone for
enjoying something really I suppose keys
I know this is related to the same thank
you oh oh okay you know what let's do a
little bit of out Twitter Kunik cuz
we've really abandoned the poor the poor
peeps on Twitter tonight three hundred
and twenty new interactions alright here
we go alright I was wondering if you
could suggest a good gaming keyboard
with macro keys I also type a lot so it
need to be good for typing uh you know
what actually g7 ten plus would be a
great choice
BAM okay here spend some time with the
g7 ten plus I'll do Twitter question was
prevent see what you think because of
build quality like pretty solid to me
alright 27-inch monitor with two to
three millisecond response time don't
care about the Hertz and a matte bezel
under $400 what would you recommend
you know what Ian that's you've got such
a good idea of what you want you might
as well just type that all into Google
and find it however two to three
millisecond response time is totally
unrealistic so this is where you're
asking me for something that actually
doesn't probably exist um Wow a lot of
people are asking me to unbox the Razer
Ouroboros so I should probably do
something about that
I haven't actually can I now you know
this to myself I don't who's sweet I can
email myself a tweet to remind me but I
will try to remember to deal with that
because a lot of people ask me for that
and now I've lost where we were what
have you done this lick okay here we go
we're typically at around one gig for
most modern games however more gigs is
only really useful for high res or mini
displays
I'm Nick that has not been my experience
I've seen games use more than a gig of
ram a contract with s3 for 24 months
will cost around 1k but by the phone for
407 12-month contract is a better deal
okay Syed um
you live in the UK obviously and it
might be different there but here trust
me it is a way better deal to just get
the phone with a contract especially
because you have to get a service plan
anyway I know that Wireless is really
cheap in the UK but here it's totally
different because Canada is really big
and to a lesser extent the u.s. is quite
big as well compared to the UK in the UK
you put up like what three cell towers
and you have deployed the latest
high-speed technology whereas the
carriers in Canada have - I mean how
many towers do you think they have to
put up compared to like + ridiculous and
then they don't even they get like a lot
of carriers in Canada or face their
coverage off of population coverage not
land coverage yeah yeah I think that
because although cover is like like ABC
but cover like Vancouver and Victoria
Island I've been like a little bit of
Kelowna and stuff and then they're like
don't go up from there seriously okay
look it I've seen the Rodgers map
because it's just like it the top is
like empty yeah it's empty and then it's
like it like scoops up a little bit on
the west coast and then kind of goes
like
and then jumps a bit when I get some
Ontario that's about it right so like
you're not really kidding old Canada
codes so yeah here the the plans are
actually super expensive like my
cellphone's about a hundred dollars a
month because I have to place some calls
to the US so I need I need a couple more
advanced features for business Nick
Carter asks is it possible to find this
yes it is eBay has them ebay.com go
their search for 2560 x 1440 what is the
best fans up for the corsair obsidian if
i don't use the bottom fan mail going to
use an h 100 i in the top mount just use
Noctua f-series for everything and it
will always be the best actually I don't
remember if this he sent me has 140 mm
fans you know what best fan sup is
always easy find good fans put them in
your case don't worry too much about it
beyond that
200 - I've read a lot that you need to
millisecond response time monitors for
to gain what max response time do you
think is needed for gaming anyone who
tells you you need a two millisecond
response time for gaming is an idiot
because it doesn't exist there is no
such thing as a monitor with 2
millisecond response time that doesn't
exhibit motion blur which is exactly
what the response time means response
time is its Friedan and I have to grade
a gray or whatever the other one is and
it means how quickly the pixels can
change color pixels are not fast they
are slow they are so slow compared to
CRT compared to DLP and projection are
in projectors compared to plasma LCD
pixels are slow so any monitor that is
rated at 2 milliseconds you know right
off the bat they're lying because none
of them are that fast what's more
important than the response time of the
panel because there's only like a half a
dozen maybe I don't know how many panel
manufacturers are left there's LG
Philips
there's Samsung I think a ul still
manufacture some but there's only a few
guys left actually manufacturing LCD
panels so it's all the same stuff so
it's not like one of them is like we're
already faster than something else
because of like magic
so yeah so anyone who tells you know 2
milliseconds is lying also the
electronics of the monitor are in some
ways way more important than the actual
spawns time on the screen since you know
that that's going to be pretty much the
same so I have a monitor that has such
bad input lag it's an input lag how long
it takes between the monitor receiving
the signal and actually sending that to
the pixels before they change so I'll go
like this it's like when I move the
mouse like it's just terrible it's an
older monitor none of the new stuffs
that bad mostly you just see like motion
blur on VA panels but um where was I
going with this
if you must have the fastest possible
monitors get a 120 Hertz panel Ben Q's
24 20 T is excellent on a sousou's VG
series I think it's at V TV age
something whatever they're they're 120
Hertz and 144 Hertz panels are as good
as you're gonna get the colors are
terrible the viewing angles are terrible
don't ask me if it's the best monitor
because it's not but it is the fastest
and like okay it still matters if you're
ridiculously hardcore but the 2ms thing
is kind of a sham just try and go for
one that's good quality like he was
talking about okay christian says he
buys off contract for his phones can get
a better plan that is cheaper in the
long run okay again depends how it works
for your from in canada you do not get a
cheaper plan for having your own phone
no but this is educational for me now i
understand why people do it because here
in canada injuries mix yeah people still
do it here though yeah that i don't
understand um I bought a phone case
because my old one broke ah
Slick's pics and minuses finest that's
not bad for our for our like top five
choices
why hasn't cricket caught on in Canada
um well the Sox are an issue it's a very
European game yeah I know they're those
Sox here and I think the a lot of sports
are influenced from like a really long
time ago and I think the whole American
Canada trying to separate themselves
from the European grouping of countries
um by the way look at this guy look at
him
I don't think that's why people don't
wanna play it are you sure that's not
why people don't want to play it look at
him I mean here it doesn't get any
better
look at these guys so look good look
early truly yeah but hurting Cummings
inexplicable - but it's huge in Canada
old people play it it's like golf we're
like old people can still do this so
maybe that's why it's popular you look
at these guys these guys are probably
like super famous and awesome look how
badass this guy looks look at that look
on his face and this guy's a dreamboat
but come on I got like stars on their
uniform and stuff okay okay I mean it's
not getting any better for this game
okay good this kids pretty cool okay
fine we're not gonna pick on cricket any
more I'm done I'm done and I'm sorry I'm
sorry uh you know what I think it's just
a cultural thing I mean hockey is
Canada's sport it's like you watch what
your dad watches it's like why isn't oh
boy this is gonna get ugly but like why
isn't Christianity popular in the Middle
East because your dad didn't believe in
Jesus so they never told you about it
and that's just it's it's cultural
everything is cultural
why isn't curry popular in Great Britain
because that's not what you grew up
eating so I grew up watching hockey my
dad watched hockey there's Hockey Night
in Canada it's just built into the
fabric of your culture it has a lot to
do with why is badminton not popular in
North America fantastic sport fast paced
super athletic entertaining to watch
tons of fun to play but everyone in
North America thinks badminton is this
pink pink pink badminton is not that bad
man 10 is 300 plus kilometer per hour
smashes by I played tennis and I thought
badminton I thought it was more than I
think most people from where I grew up
thought it was but then after seeing him
play it's actually
frickin ridiculous I still remember
playing myself I still remember what you
said to me the first cousin I had to it
was a late filming night and I took
slick with me to two because I was like
I want to go play badminton tonight do
you wanna just like nap on the couch
there's a couch there and you said some
of the long lines of like holy crap
you're really fast yeah yeah I did not
expect him to be that festival he did
not know the game was fast
yeah you have to be fast but it doesn't
it hasn't caught on and I yeah I don't I
don't know you had slits pick sounds
like nude pics of slake you know what we
could add that to the forum my traffic
yeah might drive traffic okay guys if
you would come to our forum to semiotics
in ham then go away cuz he's really not
that good-looking
let's cover him up again nude pixels
think I have to GTX 560 MS aligned with
yes your power supplies fine
what does gosu mean I believe Pro in
Korean probably in Korean it's from
sorry it's from handsome I think it's go
handsome gamer calm the big star cough
caster has a site where he sells shirts
and they all reference Starcraft and
you'll see go suits dark pants I was
really good you don't care just keep
going
I like it though it's cool do you feel
the nostalgia of the days you wanted a
Motorola RAZR so badly
actually I don't I've never been a phone
guy I've owned like five phones in my
life over a span of like 10 years so
that should give you guys some idea what
my upgrade cycle is and it was always
whatever was free with a contract or
whatever like work offered me the only
reason why I ever got a phone in the
first place was that I could get on the
cheapest phone with the cheapest plan
that offered unlimited texting so that
my girlfriend could text me it was the
only reason I got I got it so that she
could talk to me I've never bought a
phone I just realized that my mom bought
me my first phone because it was like
this cool Motorola thing it was called
the me box or something like that it had
a full keyboard it was the first like
cell phone like mainstream cell phone it
was $200 with a plan that had a full
keyboard then that one broke so I got a
warranty replacement of something else
and then that one died so I used someone
else's
phone and then I got my job at NCIX and
they issued me a blackberry and then
that one got to be like three and a half
years old and I was up for renewal so
then I got an iPhone with my plan and it
was provided by work I've never bought a
phone there you go I just realized that
I learn something every day well I
didn't learn it but I realized it sort
of the same thing oh my goodness it is
not a 130 Hertz monitor some people have
managed to overclock the early ones
that's done down in Soviet Russia Google
Linus is you okay thank you Peter I have
a level 10 GT you wanted to know if I
can keep my family to use the same color
at boot I have no idea I also don't know
why that would matter - is links isn't
that so you need to say that you have to
sacrifice qualities for high frame rates
for the 120 Hertz mother yes yes you do
the only way to get high frame rates
great color and um yeah high frame rates
are like fast frequencies great color
and like great brightness and all that
stuff is to have you know 60 pound CRT I
kind of wish someone still made like
like a 24 inch widescreen CRT I'd be
kind of Awesome the shipping costs on
those are nowadays well I mean it was
always that was always a huge part of
why CRTs for expenses no I know I'm just
saying like like you're incredible yeah
it would have to be just like horrible
comparing and the volumes would be so
low yeah cuz nobody wants the CRT I mean
some people think but they're very
nation uh okay we've got like I thought
I thought I saw someone say something
about tedious oh no I thought someone
said our conversation was tedious if you
guys don't like the conversation I'm
very sorry moderators from forums will
be individually selected based on
contribution in the forum that much is
set in stone at this point in time what
you got for a topic
got a couple things probably see yes oh
yeah so guys we mentioned a little while
back that we're gonna be at CES so he
and I and Diesel's coming to now yeah
are gonna be at CES this year we are
going to be doing all kinds of cool
stuff we want to know what's your
priority so the goal is to provide the
most complete content possible so we
want to do video then we want to have
pictures to go along with a little
written article that has the video
embedded in it we want you guys to have
the CES experience that you would have
if you got to go which you don't because
you don't have an industry affiliation
unless you do in which case maybe I'll
see you there so what's the most
important to you guys because there's a
lot of aspects number one is there's the
show floor itself where you're gonna
have a lot of iPhone accessories like
serious business like a third of the
booths will be like iPhone crap then
there'll be like the Intel thing which
will be like this huge thing and
probably its own dedicated video or
multiple videos and then in between that
you've got guys like you know shuttle
for example where they're like IT cool.i
key components showing off new stuff but
they're not Intel and they're also not
iPhone accessories where it's kind of
cool stuff then you've got the Suites so
guys like some of the boutique you guys
like you know an EVGA or someone like
that Corsair might have all their new
stuff on display too sweet in a nearby
hotel and finally there's just the
general hubbub you guys want to see like
the traffic and like just all the people
around and like sort of some of the cool
stuff going on outside the CES building
so what's your priority what do you guys
want to see you want to see the show
floor you want to see the Suites and
focus on sort of what's on display more
privately or do you want to focus on
like do you want to see keynotes and
stuff which I don't think is gonna be an
option because we can't get press passes
but yeah okay forget the keynotes we
can't bring you that um but do you guys
guys just want like general footage or
the whole thing you want like the
beanthere experience right yeah but like
also what thanks for the contribution
like dude if you were talking pretty
quick the whole time what you want me to
do um like you all I want to say
something when you're talking I just
talk over here cuz you're a jerk
Oh like do you want more of a focus on
written articles do you want do you want
quick quick quick articles all the time
or do you want just like more in-depth
thorough articles like yeah just what do
you guys want now what do you want lot
of computers okay well we don't have to
transition into that right away we could
actually read what they're saying okay
okay
bugs no iPhone stuff all right is it
useful having four gigs of um yes
however I have no idea how much via
Graham future games we'll use because
they're not here yet when are you going
to play Super Mario Brothers we said
yeah I have no idea I have no idea
it's we're both ridiculously busy so
finding time to sit down and bust the
super brothers is gonna be hard yeah so
that's in school I work full time plus
YouTube so that should give you guys
some idea but like we will I think at a
point in time we will get it done maybe
in the summer yeah like it like it might
take a long time but it we will announce
that the forum is live the second it's
live guys yeah I might do some first I'm
testing for the forum I might just post
on my Twitter so we don't get completely
redid cuz Caesar crushed because we will
if we post it on your Twitter right um
so I might just post it on mine and I
might just put it up for a little bit of
time just to test certain things and
I'll probably have a theme like post
pictures or something here's a good
question if and asking me I guess if you
have any if you actually why don't we
both answer if you could have any phone
now for free would you go with an iOS
phone or Windows or Android go I would
love your fasting I would love to try
the new Windows one but I would probably
go with what if you were locked into it
like what if you're a cheap person like
you are he's like one of the cheapest
people I know what if you were cheap and
you knew that whatever phone you pick
you're stuck with it for the next three
years
Thanks is for you'd go with the Nexus 4
yep done Nexus support is amazing you'll
always get the new OS upgrades you
always get all that kind of stuff so the
Nexus 4 okay I love my s3 it's great but
if
walk into something I would like it to
be an xx 40 issues anyways um if I'm
locked into something Nexus and the
newest one is the Nexus forward it's
getting awesome reviews and it's just
generally great so we haven't go thanks
it's for haste oh I would get an iPhone
5 you don't what okay not not because
I'm a zealot but a couple of reasons
you're used to the user experience I am
used to it
I hate learning new things although I
have spent a fair amount of time with
Android just because I have to because
it's my job however all the apps I own
are on iOS I have bought apps and my
grading is a pain I have an iPad and I
don't like Android tablets yet I haven't
found one that I really really like I
used my Galaxy Tab 10.1 to watch flash
videos other than that I refuse to use
it I use the iPad I use my TF 700 again
for watching flash videos when the
battery is dead on the Galaxy Tab
because it's too heavy
then the Galaxy Tab is lighter I'm a
really picky user and I've had people
say that I'm just like a really like you
know don't be such a bitch just use
whatever but come on guys if you could
have every tablet yo wouldn't you just
be picky about which one you use I mean
they're all here why don't I use the one
I like best
BAM so um so yes so I like you know
having that that ecosystem that is
similar I'd never go Mac for it like I'd
never go back to have the full
integration thank God I don't know maybe
I'd consider a Windows Phone I'm
interested in the Windows folks whose
eighties free awesome we play around
with that Samsung enough though I know
it wasn't enough we saw the Samsung
Windows 8 Phone and yeah the windows 8
launch party looked awesome it looks
great it was based at me basically an s3
made out of metal yeah that had fine
nose aid on it so it was pretty is
pretty pretty legit the camera sucked I
didn't know the camera sucked did it
yeah supposed to be the same as this one
I don't think so
oh good even know what mr. tablet it was
the tablet but the camera tablet okay
yeah the the Windows eight one from
Samsung has the same camera as this
which is sorry okay my bad um okay I
would waffle about it it would be a
tough choice I wouldn't go Android
though okay I'm not surprised that just
cuz well I know you don't like these
experience I personally I think interest
pay and you know what this comes down to
that fanboy or something again where
honestly sometimes fanboy ism isn't
fanboy isn't sometimes it's a negative
past experience the Android experience
with my wife's phone has been terrible
but you're using like again not a Nexus
device you didn't get updates and you're
using one like an older Android device
and older Android OS is we're not that
popular this is this is a good one Trent
asks can you do more 3d monitor
unboxings around 23 inch and more
affordable not those $600 ones please
this is a great example where if you
checked it out and you searched for 3d
monitors on safe for example a popular
retail website like NCIX what you'd see
is that the 3d monitors do cost a lot so
for me to unbox the ones that are not
expensive would be very difficult
slick specs and minuses Lube - likes
that's not bad is that on Twitter or
something no okay do you have anything
else for really important discussion
topics because it's 1042 already for
people that are really into games a new
release that's coming out fairly soon I
think it's right at the beginning in
December Far Cry 3 if you look on
YouTube there's a the first 20 minutes
of the game looks awesome
really excited for Far Cry 3 the
storyline sounds amazing if you've been
following the storyline updates at all
and the gameplay video is just it's
great
check it out 20 minutes the room
storyline at all the others the advert
on The Escapist is terrible the voice
actor is I think the worst I've ever
heard
the voice actor in the main character I
think it's did I maybe it's just for the
ads like maybe he just phoned in the ad
spot or something because it was
just terrible my friend dunno I went to
an island and then well that's the whole
captured me originally he's kind of like
a prissy boy man his brothers in the
army and his brother like in a little
tiny bit of time trains him like very
basic things and then he has to like
find his way to survive and he becomes
if it's better than far cry 2 I'll be
happy like he's got like rich parents
and stuff when they sent him on this
trip and then all of his friends got
captured and killed and etc okay Harry
asks a question that can be addressed
he wants to blog about something
everyday computer and gaming server he
needs a GPU with dual HDMI no you don't
DVI is the same signal as HDMI DVI to
HDMI adapter is exactly the same image
quality as trade HDMI and vice first
stuff for that matter the only
difference is that HDMI has half the
bandwidth of dual link DVI we can leave
that one oh yeah we can actually leave
those for next week cuz there's uh we've
kind of run out of time I just want to
see if anyone else has tyler asks do I
still have the surface I do not that was
only an eval unit I only got to hold
onto it for about two weeks
oh I did really like it though this is
this is time-specific
steam sales there's tons of epic epic
epic steam sales going on Black Friday
yeah but there's there's like some done
by hours there's some done by days like
go check it out there's gonna be new
steam sales up all the time and a lot of
them are really good they have a cup I
know there's a reddit thread for like
all the top to discount ones so some of
them are like 80% 75%
cool should check it ok well I've been
corrected one writes back in to say
actually - you're wrong I have 120 Hertz
dot biz hahahaha hold on actually it's
on sale and people are having good
results a BAM sold out since November
first so I don't know I don't know who's
right let's go back to Twitter ah let's
see
yuvigi a step up from 660ti SLI two to
six eighty s and s like right that hard
to say depends how much you're paying
for it what's your experience yeah
surface RT I really liked but I'm really
excited for sir
Pro full windows 8 full windows 8 that's
gonna be you install things and fully
dues the truly awesome like super
excited about that oh yeah I love it
good ideas something something what was
the question we even asked I don't think
anyone's answered it I use xsplit what
people want to see yes yeah nobody
answered it
yes this is a good monitor if the
surface Pro's at CES you should do an
in-depth article on that yes absolutely
absolutely this is good to hear
ok no maybe I should change my answer
then maybe I should just like say I'd
bite the bullet and go for Windows 8
over go what do you think of the g7 10
plus I ok if it's in here for a while
right hold it up because they can't see
it because it's one of my first things
that I noticed is the whole don't know
if you can see that so oh yeah you can't
as I turn it like this steel the glossy
we talked about that earlier today the
whole thing's glossy and the whole time
I've been sitting on this not the whole
thing
okay of course well you mean of course
there's a lot of coffee razor razor has
a glossy keyboard do they have the like
oh so like husam mirror was super glossy
yes yes I saw someone with it at Al and
it was the most disgusting thing I've
ever seen oh ok anyways the whole time
I've been sitting here did you guys see
me looking down a lot it's because I'm
grabbing my shirt like this and putting
my finger in it so I can clean the
glossiness cuz it is just driving me
insane already so I do not like that at
all the keys feel good
obviously I'm a fan of Blues so I'm not
really gonna comment on that too much
keycaps seem pretty legit there's a few
things like game-mode I wish that was a
switch they're gonna toggle that um they
can't see what you're doing I'm just
saying right yeah I know like the mute
button and game mode should be switches
in my opinion okay other than that it
seems pretty legit the build quality
seems really good really really good
would you put it up there with Philco
and ducky the build quality yeah
see I'm already cleaning more of the
glossy stuff I don't know I still think
I need more time with it okay but maybe
close though close I think it's like one
of the biggest contenders so far but I
still think Falco and Daphne would be
probably okay well thank you guys yeah
yeah okay so thank you guys for watching
the livestream tonight and peace out
what did you just do you did your peace
sign
