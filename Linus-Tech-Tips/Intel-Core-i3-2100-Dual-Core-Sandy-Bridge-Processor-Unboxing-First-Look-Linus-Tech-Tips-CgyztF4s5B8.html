simple one probably one that I should
have done long ago but I just haven't
really gotten around to it this is the
Intel Core i3 2100 it is a dual core mmm
there you go dual core hyper threading
processor it's clocked at 3.1 gigahertz
which is pretty darn good considering
the price point and the reason that I'm
unboxing it today we just grabbed my
knife here the reason I'm unboxing it
today is that I needed one because for
my upcoming Goodenough gaming guide I
will be using this processor 2 as the
backbone of my good enough gaming PC now
a lot of people ask me why did you go
with the i3 2100 when I did my initial
video where I showed the entire
specifications of the rig that I'd be
using for good enough gaming and my
answer is that dual core is still going
to perform the best in most games that
are on the market right now at the price
point
it delivers a killer value and yeah I
don't think I really have to just mice
justify myself beyond that it's a it's a
pretty pretty impressive little chip so
that's pretty much everything oh yeah
it's got three Meg's of cash which you
can see here it has a 65 watt TDP which
means the lower low power consumption
compared to some of the more high-end
chips in Intel's own lineup here we go
hyper threading technology HD graphics
mm so that is the lower end of the Sandy
Bridge onboard graphics to pitted memory
controller no turbo boost please do note
that you guys there is no turbo boost on
this particular processor although hyper
threading is present as I mentioned
before so that means you'll have two
physical cores for active threats here
is the integrated box Intel cooler which
sucks but it's going to be more than
adequate for a dual-core 65 watt chip
like this however if you were okay see
this is something I would normally say I
would normally say if you're going to be
doing any overclocking then you're going
to want a better thermal solution but
you will not be doing any overclocking
the i3 2100 is not overclocking ready
even if you put it on a piece Evon
chipset board you will not be able to
overclock this
more than about a couple percent so bear
that in mind guys this is a claw o'clock
chip you cannot increase the multiplier
and on the P 67 and well H 67 861
platforms you cannot increase the
multiplier on or you cannot really
increase the base clock so it comes with
the sticker three year warranty guide
well it's not really a guide but for
your warranty documentation and then in
the environmentally friendly cardboard
packaging you will find a CPU it looks
just like this it is for the LGA 1155
platform which means it fits in a socket
with 1155 pins go ahead and take that
out have a look at it so you can see the
heat spreader has kind of a brushed
metal finish to it which is pretty
typical the last 100 billion years that
that's this is what a processors pretty
much looked like if we go back as far as
even the Northwood chips he kind of look
like this all right there's all your
pins on the bottom this is not backwards
compatible with LGA 1156 as i've
mentioned numerous times in my previous
videos so don't try and jam it in an
1156 socket you will damage the
processor motherboard or both so thank
you for checking out this unboxing and
stay tuned for my good enough gaming PC
where I target $600 to build a decent
gaming machine and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to compare it against
the system you can get for just over
$1000 to find out how close to that
performance we can get on a budget
