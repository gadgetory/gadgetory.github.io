motherboard from gigabyte this is an age
fifty-five board you can tell from the
name it is H 55 that's a chipset M which
is micro ATX and normally they have ut
something something something after here
and this is or s something this is not
that they are just calling this up
what's special about this board is that
it is USB 3 so you can see up here it is
also USB 3.0 that is like huge it's like
a quarter of the front of the block so
it has a three year warranty and it
includes as you may or may not have
guessed USB 3.0 10 X SuperSpeed also USB
power 3 X now this is a cool feature
because this gives you three times the
power that is SPECT for USB 3.0 through
each port so if you're running a hub you
can actually run three full power USB
devices without using an external
adapter very cool it features ultra
durable 3 which is normally a huge icon
Lake or logo like this and isn't today
smart 6 it supports Core i5 core i3 it
supports core i7 LGA 1156 chips too but
I think part of the reason they're not
calling that out is because the core i7
chips do not have onboard video unlike
the core i3 s and the core i5 dual cores
so you won't actually be able to take
advantage of all of the features of this
board and you'd probably be better off
with a p55 for it if you are buying an
i7 so here's our users manual which
includes a motherboard utility and
driver DVD you don't use this download
the latest off the gigabyte website
alright then we've got a dual D home
theater it's sticker thank you
alright then we've got our smart six
users manual bunch of different
languages cool oh whoa I dropped it it's
no good okay multilingual installation
guidebook so that will show you how to
install your CPU how to install around
how to install the front panel
connectors bunch of different languages
thanks so much I owe shield so you can
already see compared to the other age 55
boards from gigabyte I've had a look at
there are a few more extras in the Box
although not much you've got two SATA
cables one of them is straight and one
is right angled and one IDE cable for
crying out loud give us more SATA cables
and don't bother giving us an IDE cable
anymore that said this could be useful
for a lot of people I you know I take
that back
because a lot of people running sort of
like a micro ATX to more value solution
are probably reusing their old
Deidre's which is probably IDE so I
totally take that back I can definitely
see the justification okay fine I was
wrong
gigabyte was right all right let's have
a look at the board itself so we'll
start with the general features first of
all we have two PCI Express 16x
connectors this one is 16x true because
you can see all the little connectors
inside this one is an 8 X connector so
you see all the little spots here but
it's only wired electrically for 4x so
even if this board does support
crossfire which I'm not sure if it does
I can't actually tell it doesn't even
really matter you wouldn't want to use
this board for optimal crossfire
performance because this is a PCIe 4x
slot you're not going to get the best
performance out of it your tip sets down
here you've got a couple of USB two-hour
sorry 3 USB 2.0 headers right here and
then you've got a wide variety of SATA
slots so did you these are all SATA 2
and I believe these are SATA 2 as well
yes they are so these are off the
gigabyte SATA 2 chip which is also
powering your IDE port and then these
are off of the Intel chipset okay here's
your front panel connectors like all p55
and age 55 boards you've got support for
dual channel ddr3 here's your 24 pin
power connector located in exactly its
most convenient place along the right
hand edge of the board here's your LGA
1156 socket now something to note about
this is that it does support all LGA
1156 CPUs core i3 is Core i5 dual cores
Core i5 quad cores and core i7s but you
will not be able to take advantage of
the onboard graphics unless you're using
a core i3 or a Core i5 dual core which
has onboard graphics on the CPU because
this chipset does not have any onboard
graphics built into it so be cognizant
of that okay here's all of our power
delivery circuitry up here I wouldn't
mind it seeing some cooling on it but
what are you gonna do it's a pretty
value-oriented board and quite honestly
the kinds of chips you should be putting
in a board like this do not suck a lot
of power you're not going to make them
all that hot up here is our 8 pin power
can odds
excuse-me CPU power connector so that
will deliver power to your CPU in its
ideal location at the top left of the
board and
let's have a look at the conductivity we
have at the back so first of all we have
one of those great mouse keyboard ps2
combo ports I love these then we've got
a couple USB ports we have every onboard
video solution you could possibly want
DVI VGA DisplayPort and HDMI we have an
optical audio out we have a couple more
USB 2.0 ports we've got a firewire port
an eSATA port and then we have two USB
3.0 ports so only six USB ports on the
back but two of them are USB 3.0 so and
they're all 3x power so you could I mean
you could be running a hub off each one
of these without even worrying about
overpowering them so I mean you've got a
lot of expansion options really Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio thank you for
checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
