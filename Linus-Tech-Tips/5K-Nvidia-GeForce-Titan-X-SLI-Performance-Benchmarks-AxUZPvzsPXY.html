4k gaming pictures 4k screen savers 4k
small hamsters running on wheels in my
basement to power the machine that I'm
planning to do actually I probably
shouldn't talk about that you know what
screw 4k anyway I'm over 4k I'll see
your 4k and I'll raise you 1k to 5k and
then I'll sweeten the pot with two
NVIDIA GTX Titan X graphics cards and
SLI and well I guess you probably see
where this is headed now 5k Titan X SLI
performance baby
fractal design listens and the define
are five case was made with feedback
from you the community click right there
to learn more about that so let's start
with a quick recap of the Titan X just
so we're all on the same page it's a
thousand dollars and outperforms the
previous fastest single GPU card on the
planet the GTX 980 by anywhere from 25
to 40 percent or more it's also got a
massive 12 gigabyte gddr5 frame buffer
that I and probably many other reviewers
and gamers are looking at going okay
that's cool but why and other than
because we can the best answer that I
can come up with is the same one that
prompted Nvidia to put six gigs of RAM
on the original Titan at the time when
the highest end gaming cards had two to
three being ready for higher resolutions
and higher quality textures in the
future but the future is a long way away
and I might be dead by then so forget
waiting we still haven't gotten around
to sending back the Dell u P 27 15 K 5 K
yes 50 120 by 2880 14 freaking megapixel
monitor so when the Titan X rolled in
the first thing I said was well can you
send me another one so I can run SLI on
this 5k display and video was like know
what this is like the coolest thing ever
and you're saying no well they stuck by
there no and so when that whole attempt
didn't work for me the instant I got
that email I started calling everyone I
knew and within a few minutes EVGA
stepped up and overnighted their Titan X
card to us so we could try out the
future of high resolution gaming to let
you guys know all about it so I'm going
to hand off to Luke to give you the
rundown on the 5k Titan X SLI gaming
experience and thank you EVGA because
holy this is awesome this was my first
time playing on 5k on a proper display
and it's a wondrous thing to behold
due to the Titan X's SLI performance I
was able to smoothly run games at an
average of 50 fps and above while
getting nowhere close to the 12 gigabyte
frame buffer and not even being
overclocked with settings for most games
sitting at Ultra or equivalents my FPS
counter never did
below 44 minimums on any of my
benchmarking runs and Crysis 3 the only
game that I didn't run at max settings
could have actually had it settings
cranked to the max as well if I was
willing to sacrifice some FPS but I kind
of thought that if you're spending two
grand on your graphics cards that you're
probably going to want a better
experience than 30 FPS gaming please
note that the default sli profile for
shadow of mordor is a little wonky on
its own and I would recommend following
we'd drunk UNS guide on the steam
community forums on how to easily fix
this issue I was having quite a few
problems with really awkward frame rates
before using this fix and even at
relatively low settings but after this
fix everything was super smooth and if
super smooth is something that you're
looking for all this pretty much
actually sums up the whole experience
it's pretty awesome being able to jump
into a fairly hard to run game at a
massive resolution make no settings
compromises and still run at a beast
frame rate speaking of performance
things ting provides their customers
with affordable and reliable wireless
coverage they claim that their pay only
for what you use model would save 98
percent of people money on their monthly
cell phone bill but you don't have to
take their word for it if you head over
to Linus ENCOM you can try out their
savings calculator where you get to
enter the information from your last
three Wireless bills letting them know
what you used and what you paid and then
they'll be able to tell you how much you
would have saved if you were on ting
they have amazing customer service since
employee people actually pick up the
phone where you'll get humans picking up
the phone instead of robots and they let
everyone know that their service runs on
the Sprint network so if you check how
Sprint coverage is in your area you'll
know what kind of service you'll receive
with ting and now they've opened up gsm
compatibility to their now iPhone 6 or 6
plus will work on their network but the
best part is that if you use the link in
the description down below when you sign
up that's lana staying calm you'll get a
$25 off awesome new device or $25 off a
service credit that's a pretty decent
payout for watching this little ad so
check out ting today and check out the
link in the video description for more
all right guys what do you guys think
about the crazy overkill dual Titans you
think you'll need something like this
for valve vive or och you
this or whatever because it's need some
pretty high resolutions at some pretty
high frame rates well you guys are here
watching the video click like button
subscribe buttons follow buttons all
that kind of stuff cook all the buttons
around the video that helps us out a
bunch you want to comment down below
that's also kind of cool I guess but
it's better if you go over to the forum
will actually read it there let me know
you guys think this is overkill do you
guys think this is something you'll need
for really really high frame rate really
high resolution VR or something like a
5k display let me know also while you're
on the forum check out the help us kind
of support lioness media group thing and
do stuff like buy a shirt get stuff from
our affiliates and sponsors and change
