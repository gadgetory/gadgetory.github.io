I'm just putting the finishing touches
on what I call the G dog and crazy
Russian just facepalm
so what I'm actually doing today is I'm
showing you guys we validated overclock
that we will be using on all beste g1
systems that were shipping this has been
painstakingly tested to find a good
balance between temperatures voltages
and the overall clock speed that we are
able to achieve with this particular
system so with it all closed up running
it and what we consider to be a real
world environment here's what we've got
it dialed into we are going to be
running the core i7 6 core processor at
4 gigahertz ok this is fully prime95
stable and I'd like the crazy Russian to
come over here and have a look at our
cores 0 1 2 8 9 and Pinton for whatever
reason that's how cpuid seems to be
picking them up but I think what it
really means is 0 1 2 3 4 5 which would
be 6 cores okay and check out check this
out so our maximum CPU temperatures over
a period of time that I am about to tell
you is 75 degrees on the very hottest
core very nice so I'm going to go ahead
I'm gonna press stop on our prime 95 and
you can see that we have had this
running for seven hours and four minutes
no around way longer than that what the
heck's going on here that's interesting
so crazy Russian failed again
you changed the system time so that's
why that's why the timer doesn't thinks
that it started on on April 1st at
whatever time and then ended on no okay
go check this out check this out check
this out so it figures it started on
April 2nd at 5:30 and ended on April 1st
at 6 o'clock so what actually happened
is this ran for 24 hours
since yesterday so this is a fully
validated overclock and like I said
every vestige e1 system will be shipping
at this clock speed which is pretty
sweet
crazy Russian asked me to make this joke
the best of g1 is so fast that it goes
forward and you know it goes backwards
in time it doesn't he said to say it's
goes so fast it goes forwards in time
but that's not even right because the
test started on April 2nd and ended on
the first
so basically crazy Russian is burning
our own system because he's saying it
goes back in time well you know what
it's just really fast
forget crazy rush and he has no idea
what he's talking about I mean he wears
this hat I'm not from around here okay
