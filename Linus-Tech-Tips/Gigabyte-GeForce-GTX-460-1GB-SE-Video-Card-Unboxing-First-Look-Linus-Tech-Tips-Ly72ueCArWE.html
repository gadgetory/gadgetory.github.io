at the GeForce GTX 460 one gig but
there's something here that you need to
make a note of this is the SE which in
computer terms it usually stands for
slightly reduced edition so the GTX 460
one gig se actually performs at low
resolutions similarly to the GTX 460 768
Meg but performs a little bit better at
higher resolution so it's a bit of a
it's a bit of an oddball part and not
all of the Nvidia board partners even
came out with one this is a gigabyte
card by the way and so all of the board
partners were given free rein there's no
reference design so they were given free
rein to design it however they wanted so
this is the gigabyte version that's what
we're going to be having a look at today
let's start with the packaging it is
like all GeForce GTX 460 s 3d vision
ready cuda ready sli ready physics ready
all that good nvidia stuff this
particular one comes factory overclocked
so in terms of that top performance you
may find it performs a little bit better
than a normal GTX 460 S II okay mind you
you could do that overclocking yourself
it has a three year warranty in the US
and Canada it comes with their wind
force air anti turbulence cooling cooler
which we're going to have a look at once
to get this opened up as well as ultra
durable VGA which has all these things
going for it ultra durable is a bit of a
carryover from gigabytes motherboard
technology so here we see it has one gig
of gddr5 256-bit memory interface that
other stuff we already pretty much
talked about and what else do we have
here ok they're going to give us some
more explanation of the anti turbulence
cooling win for so 2x anti turbulence
inclined fins ok the latest cooling
gigabyte understands the fan is crucial
to the graphics card so only the fan
with the most efficiency is like for
wind for ultra-quiet pwm fans anti
turbulence inclined fins ok pure copper
heat pipes ok so they're saying
it's silent and helps heats can spread
effectively from hot areas all right
let's get this part opened up and have a
look I'm tired of looking at the box
then consumed in right now there we go
all right yes for 60 s the first thing
we will find inside is a user's manual
and multilingual installation guide as
well as a driver disk throw the driver
disk away keep the installation guide
just in case you need it next we have
two molex to dual molex to single 6 pin
PCI II adapters although I'll go with my
usual recommendation that if you're
buying a graphics card that requires two
PCIe 6 pins you should probably have a
power supply that already has them we
have a mini HDMI to HDMI adapter so I
guess you can assume that the card is
going to have mini HDMI we also have a
DVI to VGA adapter if you are still
using a VGA monitor it looks like the
packaging has been repurposed a little
bit from a longer graphics card since
you can see there's quite a bit of space
at the end of the 460 se okay that's a
regular piece of tape holding the
anti-static bag on okay so we find a
characteristic although I don't know how
much longer I'm going to be able to say
that because some of their new
motherboards feature matte black PCBs I
can't really talk about those yet but
they look so nice anyway we see a
characteristic blue gigabyte PCB on the
other side actually well here let's flip
it around this way first so we've got
those two 6-pin PCI II connectors for
power here's the inclined fin what's it
called wind force yes wind force cooler
which actually looks pretty sweet
it's got like a nice shiny Darth Vador
esque sort of black going on here very
very glossy I really like it and then
we've got a couple of what appear to be
60 millimeter oh those could even no I
think those are 80 millimeter fans you
know it's funny
it actually doesn't specify on the
outside of their box that's a very
strange thing you'd think they would you
think they mentioned something like that
but yeah those look like eighty
millimeter fans and then we have two
nice big heat pipes going from the
actual GPU core which hopefully you can
see down there out to the very ends of
the wind force DX now what they mean by
anti turbulence I'm just going to try to
figure out a little bit I think what
they mean is the way that the fins are
inclined they're not actually quite flat
so they're inclined this way and then
you can see the fans compared to the
card I hope you can see that are
actually inclined a little bit too so I
think the idea is that it's at rather
than the air like kind of slamming into
a surface right away it's more like a
gradual approach to it and it lets it
kind of cut through it rather than just
creating more noise and more while
they're turbulence that's my theory
anyway I could be wrong it's happened
before alright so here we are on the top
of the card where we find an SLI finger
I see so many people commenting on my
channel well what if you run GTX 460 and
3-way SLI well you can't because there's
only a single SLI figure that a finger
that goes for ATI cards our AMD cards as
well if there's only a single connector
you can only run two-way multi-gpu
configurations if you have two of those
connectors you can run three or even
four way and that's driver dependent but
yeah if there's only one you can only
run two-way so here we have our mini
HDMI which they have an included adapter
for then we have two DVI ports we also
have a vented move-up card vented PCI
backplate so you're not going to get a
whole lot of exhaust out of there based
on the design of this cooler so you can
see there's air it's going to come out
this way and it's going to kind of hit
that it's not really going to go out
there so I would consider this to be a
largely internal exhaust cooling design
although you will get a little bit of
incidental airflow coming out of the
case you're going to be spending most of
the hot air back into your case it's not
a big deal it isn't and I
sufficient cooler and as long as you
have good case fans and a
well-ventilated computer you're not
going to be running into too many
problems PCIe 16x standard slot I don't
know if I mentioned that yet but I think
that pretty much covers it so the GTX
460 se like I mentioned is a one gig
card but it is slightly cut down from
the actual regular one gig card putting
it in the performance range of a 768 Meg
card so why would you want this well I
guess the answer is if you're running at
high resolution okay and you don't want
to buy the the fully fledged 1 gig card
or if you're running kind of like older
games that don't require quite as fast
GPU but you want to run like third-party
texturepack stuff like that you need the
extra video memory this is the part for
you so don't forget to subscribe to
