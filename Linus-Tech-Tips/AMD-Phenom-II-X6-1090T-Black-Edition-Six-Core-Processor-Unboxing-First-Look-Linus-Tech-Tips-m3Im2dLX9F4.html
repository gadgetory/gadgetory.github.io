doing an unboxing of AMD's brand new
finem 2 Black Edition processor this is
the x6 1090 t so this is a finem 2 X 6
processor that means it's just like a
thin M 2 X 4 processor except with two
more and that really is it there's 6
cores in this processor they run it 3.2
gigahertz or and this is new AMD has
their new turbo core technology which
allows up to 3 cores to run at up to
three points or atom not up to at 3.6
gigahertz so if you're running something
like a game that only takes advantage of
of one two three threads of your CPU it
means that your CPU will actually bump
its own clock speed up okay so this is a
true 6 core design with 9 Meg's of total
cache it is socket am3 with a heatsink
and fan so why don't we get this thing
open it includes all of AMD's previous
technologies so it's 64-bit it's got
cool and quiet it's got their three-year
warranty all of that good stuff here's a
little bit about AMD vision technology
so they want you to use an AMD processor
with obviously an AMD chipset and ATI
Radeon graphics 2 for the best sort of
overall platform so let's get this open
they're using quite small boxes these
days it's impressive maybe it's uh you
know green or something ok so why don't
we start with the accessories that are
included first accessory is a heatsink
you can see right away this is
manufactured by AVC obviously to AMD
specifications this is a heat pipe
cooler so it uses a block or rather a
flat slab of copper at the bottom and
then it is soldered to for heat pipes so
you can see to come out of each side it
uses their stock thermal compound which
is applied in a square for you and it
has no covering on it other than the
plastic cover that goes over the whole
bottom of it it uses a standard sort of
fin design with the heat pipes coming up
and going through the tops of the fins
like I said 2 on each side and a 60
millimeter fan at the top it uses a 4
pin pwm fan power connector and then
you've got your standard AMD clips
obviously you'd have standard AMD clips
on an AMD processor
and that is your coolant solution next
we have you can actually tell right off
the bat that these six cores are not
going to be putting out a whole lot more
heat than the old four cores because
they haven't really stepped up the
cooling at all so AMD's pulled off an
engineering feat here by not shrinking
the manufacturing process not increasing
the amount of heat produced by the CPU
but actually putting 50% more cores
under the hood very cool I'm going to
show you the process or more after
though just to tease okay so here we go
we have Andy's installation guide which
huh actually still includes installation
instructions for socket 754 ah that is
bizarre so it includes 754 9 3 9 and 940
that's all the older series then you've
got a M 2 M 2 plus and a M 3 as well as
socket F or 1207 now it's funny that
they mention a M 2 m 2 plus an am 3 here
because like many of AMD's processors
over the last little while AMD has
worked really hard on the engineering
side to make their new six core CPUs
drop-in compatible with older am 2 plus
and am three boards very cool stuff so
the Fen of 2x6 you can actually drop
that into it supports both ddr2 and ddr3
you can drop it into an AM 2 plus or an
AM 3 board that you already have with
just a BIOS update obviously AMD
recommends their new 800 series chipsets
to get the most out of your phantom 2 x6
but it uses the same am-3 socket we're
familiar with and you can drop it right
in so that was pretty much all there is
to say about it it looks like almost any
other CPU at this point diffused in
Germany and native Malaysia for this
particular guy thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the AMD phenom 2 x6
no I'm not done yet
I can't believe I didn't mention this
this is a Black Edition processor it's
got an unlocked multiplier so I've
actually got an overclocking guide
coming up soon on the AMD Phenom 2 x6
and so you can you can check that out
very shortly so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the x6 1090 T</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
