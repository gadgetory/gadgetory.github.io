buggiest thing i've ever seen and i
really hope my default ah audio input
devices the microphone right here and
not the webcam oh come on there we go
let's see if new it's still using the
webcam so yeah sweet wonder if there's
anything I can do about this right now
it's at my proper microphone positioning
okay yeah so basically I hadn't actually
decided if I was going to do any kind of
a live stream tonight or not I was just
testing a new webcam one that I've got
attached to the laptop so that I can
more easily pick it up and I'll show you
guys what I'm working on or you know
graphs of performance numbers that are
in progress or whatever else the case
may be and then easily feedback so that
was sort of the concept of what I was
trying to figure out today and okay
that's probably not going to work and so
that when we didn't work out for me
because what i did is i started the
hangout on air and then I never actually
started the broadcast so I assumed if I
didn't start the broadcast that it
wouldn't be I don't even have to Blair
this because it's using the mic on the
webcam which I don't even know if it's
working or not so yeah so I didn't know
it was publishing to my channel because
I hadn't actually broadcasted anything
and then when I realized that a bunch of
people were tweeting me and asking me
when I was starting my hangouts like my
hangout what you guys talking about so
then I was like oh ok so I went to my
youtube channel and there was it said on
air and it was just black it was just
waiting to start so I realize people
been sitting here forever waiting for
the start and nothing was ever gonna
start because I didn't even know what
was happening so then what i did is i
close the Google+ Hangouts window which
I thought would shut the whole thing
down but it
and it didn't work at all so there's a
lot of people okay apparently have a
call from slick right now so I'm just
going to take this because that's the
whole point of this like on everything
right yes hello sir I'm not bad you are
not watching this are you yeah I know
I'm live streaming you called me to tell
me that I'm live streaming when I'm
sitting here on a live stream ranting
about how the live stream doesn't work
correctly you wanted to troll me lo you
have definitely achieved that just for
that I'm going to I'm gonna just take my
phone I'm gonna go like this let me show
them all your real name oh no you no no
no you hold on I'm gonna put you on
speaker I'm your fan speaker hold on
hold on okay okay so slick slicks on
speaker here now guys so I slick why
don't you tell them where you're going
this coming weekend sorry sorry hold on
hold on you're loud and if you want hot
enough rate where you going where you go
okay so anyone who wants to find slick
at PAX where would you find him
excellent and something to note is the
first person who finds slick I have
given him a special prize to give to
that person so you should go look for
slick if you're going to pax and he has
a special prize for you if you're the
first person to find him that is if he's
not lazy and he does actually bother to
take the prize with them okay I'm taking
out speaker so why are you guys dealing
to move to this
ok so these water cooling is 800d and he
just sort of happened to go on youtube
and find out that that I'm Lodge doing
right now I'm working on that big bang
empower a video right now here you guys
cannot remove the camera so you guys can
see what I'm talking about but yeah so
thanks for helping me with that by the
way I realized that the death of release
date is actually today the 28 so I'm
doing some benchmarks with it actually
the overclocking process on it was
really easy it took about I don't know
15 minutes total to get both the
motherboard dialed in to 4.6 gigahertz
and that gtx 680 lightning dialed into
like a pretty actually pretty boss
overclock as well so so overall things
are going pretty well anyway I will talk
to you later thank you for thank you for
calling me to inform me that I was lunch
dreaming because I can tell that ok cool
by this guy kids today that's what I say
he's not even not much younger than me
to be perfectly honest so I don't know I
guess we might as well do a short
sentences everyone is bored and typing
random stuff in the comments I can't
even see the comments I don't even know
where to see the comments other than
like opening up another tab and and you
know trying to make some sense of the
epic failure that is that is the
comments updating like 50 out of time
and I know you guys are telling me that
I should be using twitch TV and you're
probably right but it's not not in all
likelihood going to happen for now just
because I don't really have the I don't
really have the follower base on there
like I do on youtube so what'd you guys
think of this webcam versus the one I
was using last time ok now I see some
comments yay also somehow the yeah i
know there's ustream as well but the
same problem is we have with twitch TV
where I don't really
the I don't really help the follower
base there and guys if you do want to
send me a comment please use Twitter
because I just it's not manageable to
read the comments on the videos i'm on
twitter at linus tech and cry bosch says
can you say my name on the stream I'll
try I tried cry wash yeah so linus tech
on twitter make sure you're following
otherwise this is really really not
going to work so i don't know what else
to tell you guys at this point you have
any questions about the Big Bang empower
motherboard ah what cpu cooler is that
fascinating question that is actually
the be quiet dark rock tune or something
okay okay now the twitter is exploding
ah Tyler saddington wants a shot out and
I think the live stream just died a
slick said he's going to be in the BYOC
section of packs that he's and he's
going to be in the lead me to his friend
for streaming and we please see one will
rock it you know I don't know where they
are hold on people see let me go see if
they're around I'll go see if I can find
them a chance that kind of thing
okay everyone say hi to the kitty this
is even still working yeah there it goes
from real delay going on there say hi
rumble he's not really sure what to make
of all this because we just isn't my
phone buzzing over there because Twitter
is going crazy say hi everyone you can
dance to see dancing cat everyone loves
dancing cats on the Internet okay have
you had enough for this okay he's
leaving them that was all okay let's see
if I can actually read any of these
questions fast enough to answer them ha
what fans would you recommend for of
course our age 80 probably not to a
f-series would be your best bet for 37
sunny what's up Linus a bitch okay and
to a mcdonalds run no no mcdonalds i
already have mcdonalds today it was
terrible to find him and when i asked
every person there you know it's not
that hard because you can find you can
find a lot of pictures of him on sort of
random like reflections in the TV and
whatnot as for the graphics card behind
me is quite a few graphics cards behind
me in case you guys hadn't notice so
there's there's just one yeah me
something something 7850 power edition
from em aside and I thought the 7870
hawk edition which is also behind me
here I've got a sapphire 7950 with their
dual can cooler so that's behind me I
thought a galaxy gtx 670 that's behind
me and then what else is behind me well
technically these are behind me so i've
got a couple of 660 Ti is on a test
bench one of these is actually the one
that i'm going to give away on twitter
over the next little while here so
i'm going to set up like a scavenger
hunt or something so that people have
two people have to kind of like search
through a couple different videos and
then search through a couple different
tweets and then find the solution to the
problem that is the question for me and
we can honestly guys I cannot keep up
with this like a tall can NCIX your
borders to Malaysian know if I overclock
my 7970 a gigahertz then throw gigahertz
additional crossfire will something I
don't know it got to cut off yes it'll
probably be fine what does he sent me
said in other words should I get no
país limit um I'd probably go for the
Maximus 5 formula to be perfectly honest
the one that comes with the with that
beast USB external sound card what was
my first computer well on my first
computer was my family's computer
because I didn't I didn't own my first
computer so I guess there's two
different answers to that question the
one where I say that my first computer
was a 286 actually no because my mom had
a Commodore at one point so I didn't
really use that one though and then my
first actual personal computer was a
Pentium 166 megahertz and I used it to
run or craft to which is awesome and yes
I will begin windows 8 since my job is
to use all the latest stuff figure out
how it works and then try to educate you
people about it I don't really have a
choice I always have to use the latest
even if i don't necessarily prefer it
asked for one 680 versus to 660 ti a
great question check this out I actually
filmed see see how this is crossed out
680 vs. 660 ti sli so well that's done
that's filmed that's coming soon so stay
tuned for that can you have free swag no
am I certified like like for stds really
i don't know i don't understand i am not
saving up for ducati I'm still really
happy with the sv650s I honestly haven't
had much time to write it this year to
be perfectly honest I'm not super
disappointed with that
what is your view about hacking Tasha's
I've been meaning to try and get around
to building one at some point but i just
have not had the time at all computer
certifications no i do not have any i am
100-percent self-taught basically my my
experience amounted to reading and
spending way way too much on this crap
and then just kind of learning about it
through trial and error your msi 570 has
a 42 cooler can you return it to NCIX no
I'm afraid not my hair wet no no it's
just that there's a light right here so
you guys are catching that reflection
coming right off my head which makes it
look like my hair's either wet or
extremely greasy okay drop play
minecraft no I don't unfortunately with
babies there's not much time for sure
mine crashed EVGA SRX good question
because it's uh okay Tyler Tyler
saddington stop tweeting the same thing
over and over again because you're just
like clogging up the feed like look how
quickly these are coming in am I
supposed to read this it's ridiculous
then there's my cat it was all so
ridiculous he's nuzzling the phone
because that's somehow helpful mackinnon
benchmark to 7990 seen probably not um I
don't really have a way to get my hands
on that one as for 7970 versus 680 you
know what it doesn't really matter once
you overclock them both to the max it's
pretty much the same however if I was
going to pick a 680 I would definitely
go with the lightning edition one that I
have in here it does overclock better
than most 6 80's how to get more views
on YouTube that's a very interesting
question that's for windows being awful
the Linux or go home yeah that's
fantastic go on prices to on linux and
then we'll talk okay so getting more
views on YouTube I guess make
interesting content and make it
regularly that's the best advice I can
really give you know your age 100 isn't
going to leak Mac
five formula versus the PhD 777 G
premium I take the Maximus five just
because it has that beastly longboard
sound 500r and tech 1100 ah now I'd
probably go 11 hundred or three hundred
are 300 hours an outstanding case and
it's even cheaper it's only about 70
bucks why don't you get ads on my videos
well probably because you suck and you
have adblock which means I don't get any
revenue so there you go um what do you
want me to say ajt well I be gettin all
I probably won't be getting an iphone 5
unless this is my work phone so this is
an NCIX issued phone that's not like I
paid for it if they pay for an iphone 5
then I think happily use an iphone 5
then I won't have any complaints as for
reuploading video because I did
unboxings in two different samsung SSDs
one with an oem package and one with the
retail package and I thought I had
uploaded the one with the retail package
already but I've actually uploaded 1
billion package so I we uploaded the
same one so that was uh that was my bad
updates on my personal like you guys
really want to see nothing on my first
one right okay here cameras come with me
don't move okay we're going into the
side room we're going to need a light
for this I'm gonna turn the light around
so you want disturb that's my personal
rig right there progress being made
exactly zero zero progress no progress
at all that is all so no I will let you
guys know as soon as there are any
updates on the personal great but just
it hasn't been a priority right now lots
of crazy stuff going on some of which I
can't really talk about for now but I
will definitely talk about it more later
what SSD should you get a lot of crucial
coarser and Kingston definitely crucial
be my choice let me go and before is a
good Drive am I happy yes I am very
happy thank you how's the baby
maybe has a lot to do with why unhappy
all these of pain in the button is
sleeping right now he's actually
sleeping through this which is great
this is awesome interactive YouTube you
gotta know your dot dot and then the
tweets just went away so on yeah I
wasn't able to do anything um I know how
to snowboard I know how to ski I only
snowboard maybe once a year or so I mean
I'm so close to the mountains that it's
there's no real excuse for it I guess
but it's just hard to find the time I
guess there was no coil line on the ass
rock board that was sort of a point to
the video milk oil line but you do have
an annoying chipset fan so that's uh
that's not something that I'm going to
go for can I do these more often I don't
know I've already done three in the last
like four days so I'm it's not like I'm
going to live on YouTube do I have a
baby yes i do have a baby you're going
to come to Canada just to meet me okay
so mbus are at 45 i'm going to go ahead
and report you to the you know the
Mounties because that's what we have
here in canada do I like Australia I've
never been there although i'd love to
scuba dive there that would be kind of
awesome so for anyone who just tuned in
i guess i should probably clarify
anything you write in the comments for
this video i'm not going to see it
because it the youtube comments are
totally useless so you're going to want
to tweet any questions that you have at
me linus tech on twitter although you
can see how quickly the tweets are
moving it's pretty hard for me to keep
up with them there's only so much I can
do why do I read tweets in the lock
screen good question because if i look
at them in the map manually then I will
have to drag it down and refresh every
time and I will always be way way way
behind so that's time actually answer a
question people will have long since
moved on to other things where's my
favorite value case probably 300 are
right now on although if you want to
talk like really cheap case that's it a
fractal core 1000 just because it's
super super cheap and the layout and
size is very smart the breed of my cat
is in Bengal I have two cats rocketing
Rumble they're both bangles
how many monitors do I something
something buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz you
know I'm going to turn the phone off
silent so you guys can appreciate how
quickly these are coming in what do you
think about revo drives I think they're
too expensive for what they are you far
better off to just run rating on a
couple of stand-alone SSDs 550d vs. are
four and got to be our four for sure and
as for Alex from MSI having your dream
job um he works really hard by the way
so you know what's my view on linux it's
an operating system it doesn't really
run games so yeah it's not that relevant
to me what's there to eat in richmond
right now i'll go to silver tower
actually it's like pretty decent Chinese
food and they're open like I think 24
hours or at least very late at night I
often play there after badminton which
is it around this time from back when I
was able to do that have I been to
Europe yes I have I've been to I flew to
Amsterdam and then I took a train from
there after one day this is with my mom
for my after my grad and I stayed in
Paris for two weeks and then we really
went home minus friends left 4 dead used
to can I give you a cat know where at
the end statics building w WN c XCOM /
contact us it's kind of there it's a
good speed for a cat and today I sure
probably not happen soon have you ever
used an external back for really good
sound actually i'm using the isus
essence one right now which is a
headphone amp and an external back when
did you become interested in computers
how old are you on 26 and i became
interested in computers when i was
around 19 against 18 when i was
interested in um before that but i
didn't really I didn't really to really
get into it until later how do I manage
a full-time job in a YouTube channel
well I think most youtubers other than
the really really big ones are probably
also working at a full-time job besides
their YouTube channel it's not that much
money you guys to be perfectly honest
unless your name is you know Philip
DeFranco or raywilliamjohnson you're not
really bullying in the rolling in the
dough our hard disk safe and permanent I
have tons of shows well they're safe and
permanent until they die so that's what
rate is for not using it under D for my
personal build because I don't like the
under D as much as I like to TJ 07
something about the razor blade what
graphics card would you recommend for a
one-thousand-dollar build you know what
I probably try and find a way to squeeze
a 660 ti in there ah what is your job
pilot in statics I'm a product manager
I'm also a category manager I also
oversee our pc division and I'm our
youtube post so i have a bunch of
different positions greetings from
Sweden ah say hi to yen's for me no I
don't know which ends but I'm sure
there's a yen's that you know and he's
in Sweden i dunno won games in Sweden he
works that fractal design are you gonna
come to Bosnia no thanks for taking the
time to do live shows you're welcome
really tired actually it's probably
getting to be time to go to bed turn
your sound off y'all calton my sound off
like I got proved my point at this time
right at this point guild wars 2 you
know what I haven't played an MMO since
I played three months or since I spent
three months playing Wow and then after
three months I was like whoa it's been
three months and then that was the last
time I played an MMO so Tyler I already
did a shout out for you relax um no I
don't really have any plans to visit
Japan at a point in time although i'll
probably be in malaysia ever die at some
point for my wife's family reunion can
you get a job at NCIX you can email
careers and instead XCOM and find out
greetings from Denmark hello Denmark you
have good badminton players congrat
relations what's the best sound card the
NZXT helmet and sweaty note i still have
the helmet it's in my garage but i get
the sword to the russian so he actually
keeps it at work no i dont play CS go
haven't seen avengers yet that i did
quite enjoy the Hunger Games movie
Oliver it apparently almost his birthday
holy crap this is going so fast why
isn't NCIX worldwide well there's a lot
of shipping and insurance and logistical
issues with with worldwide detailing and
there's sort of a reason that NCIX and a
lot of the other guys don't already do
it so at this time and today x only
ships to canada and the USA I don't know
tiny Tom Logan personally actually I've
never met him he's on the East Coast and
I'm sort of on the west coast we've
never really crossed paths hi Sam what
is the time the time right now is 136 in
the morning samsung or apple what is
your opinion on Windows 8 you know what
I haven't actually used it yet besides
the consumer preview back when they did
it I did a video about it so that was
pretty much my thoughts about it it was
on the NCIX comm channel okay to 60
Hertz versus 120 Hertz ah very good
question so that video is coming really
soon in fact we shot two videos so in
one of them we had one at slicks friends
who is going to pax with do a blind
taste test to see if he could tell the
difference and then after that one we
did a second video to see if I could
tell the difference between 60 Hertz and
120 hertz so those are going to be
really interesting and those ones are
coming very very soon and asher chamoun
says shout out done sir
my brother's name is actually a sure
believe it or not but it's spelled
differently a sh ii are not a sh you are
i know people are still commenting on
youtube there's nothing i can do about
that i can't read them in time I can't
even keep up with the tweets so for
those of you who are watching on youtube
linus tech on twitter is pretty much the
only way you're going to stand a chance
of sending a message to me because yeah
you know what i have no idea how any of
the bigger youtubers could possibly do
this like the communications
unmanageable I'd love it if there was a
way for them to like four people two
thumbs up the best comments so that I
could actually sort of see which are the
ones that most people care about but
right now is just sort of very difficult
so do I like the new Batman haven't seen
it yet new baby hadn't been to a movie
in months yep sort of rough pentium 4
hyper-threading not sure not sure where
you're going with that honestly the
twitter has even accelerated at this
point if actually draining my battery
really fast what's the best should
actually I've had a couple people ask
sort of something along these lines
what's the best chipset for gaming or
what's the best motherboard for gaining
the real answer is aside from
overclocking your CPU and your memory
although that doesn't really matter
either the motherboard is not going to
have an impact on you gaming experience
unless you well unless you for example
you know want a better sound card and
your motherboard has better onboard
sound and you might have a better
experience that way but in terms of
sheer performance it's not happening and
no I'm not doing a shout out for you
quit spamming the channel inappropriate
comments will be completely ignored to
show you guys are aware all the tweets
trade your baby for the best PC ever I
don't think I have to do that
sort of have both already so it's not
necessary 1080p versus 1440p I think we
can all agree that higher resolution is
definitely better I'd love to see some
higher resolution 120 Hertz monitors
that are you know slim and no mule pixel
response time lay there anything like
that so uh spi 134 yes this is how you
talk to me thank you for being new to
Twitter good work so i'm using a
logitech 910 webcam no warehouse sale is
planned for the states I haven't seen
the CM storm stryker I don't know I
don't know if my I don't know if my baby
needs a mama he needs a computer yet
he's four months old so it's sort of a
non packaging moment yeah I love quake
three I never played any of the earlier
ones I wasn't on the into pc gaming at
that point my baby is in my personal reg
update episode 8 part 8 so he's
definitely on YouTube already so there
you go monitor bezel videos I don't
think people are that interested in the
bezels of monitors not sure when the
next warehouse sale is what is rate um
good question except that I do have a
few videos about that already and track
i'm going to try something here i'm
going to see what happens if i search
for something on youtube but can i do
that ok something something add videos
you know what I sort of give up on that
boat you know I can't figure out where
to go back to you let's go back to chat
is that where we were can we go back to
camera thing hmm seems to be still
working so I'm gonna know exactly what's
going on here doesn't help that my
windows small mm-hmm
Google Hangouts open that back up and
close the YouTube fat there we go okay I
give up on the YouTube thing but if you
search for like what is raid on YouTube
let's try that what is raid I think uh
oh wow I'm not even there fine let's try
raid explanation haha yes i am number
one and number four hits for that one so
go ahead and check that out if you're
interested in learning about raid
surround gaming or one big monitor
personally one big monitor well I can
understand why people like surround
gaming it's mostly not really my playing
it's a really cool experience but I find
it a little bit overwhelming so she can
this position rate okay oh the left arm
is working so well for me before there
we go that's unbroken pls our IPS right
now Samsung's the only one with pls
monitors and all the ones they have our
outstanding how long am I streaming for
I'm probably pretty much done and pretty
tired at this point in time marketing
Rumble tues I had Rumble here earlier
here I can I can sort of everyone again
you guys really want in your Google
there yes oh there's my kitty so you can
sit here with us for a little bit Fox on
New Zealand I don't have any thoughts on
new zealand new zealand is a non factor
for me best 120 hertz monitor at this
point i think my favorite has got to be
the benq 2420 TX it's got less see like
that's what pixel response times are
very good because there's more to it
than just so refresh rate if the pixels
are transitioning fast enough then the
refresh rate isn't going to do anything
for you because you're going to have
crosstalk between the images anyway
worth getting a 3d monitor depends do
you like 3d then it's worth it you don't
like 3d and it's not worth it
ah ah whoa going too fast to read too
fast to read too fast to read review
more value products no what no one cares
that's sort of a problem with value
products I can do as many videos as I
want about core i3 s and kingston
valueram and nobody will look forward
and nobody will watch it so that's why
that doesn't exist what right feeds
would you get with two crucial m4 still
have to sort of look it up from sure
it's on the internet somewhere gtx 690
good for surround gaming yuck although
what I would probably do is I'd grab a
couple 674 gigs or 660ti three gigs
because the 690 is limited to to the
extreme buffer because it's got only two
gigs per GPU what about raidmax what
about rednecks does it matter okay so
one thing means this cosmic Kenda what
about rednecks what about ready max it's
totally irrelevant picking on ducky
keyboards to mechanical they're good the
only one I've ever actually seen is
slicks and I like it why the Steve Jobs
YouTube pick because I think it's really
funny well we took that we took that
picture when we were shooting one of the
episodes of Nell and weekly and did you
ever find a motherboard for your
personal regno like gigabyte has some
new back 79 boards coming so I'm hoping
that one of those will not have coil
line and will not have a louder or
anything like that favorite keyboard
neonics is i will 60 right now that's
when i'm using on my personal machine
over there it's shown my face i feel
self-conscious now
I'm not looking forward to unboxing
anything in the future i have about my
next two weeks worth of unboxing is
already filming the cued up so i'm
actually looking forward to a bit of a
break from unboxing anything no I have
no plans to do anything with the 7990 I
think they're making like 500 of them or
something so it's not that relevant well
as like something something something
going so fast going so fast ah baby's
name won't be a won't be something that
we're talking about for now my favorite
food is ok I can tell I'm tired because
i can actually can put my finger food
ringer I guess I'd have to say teriyaki
chicken burger at red robin it's hard to
be done have I tried arrest n I tried
and I failed and i work tomorrow yes i
do however i'm going to be working from
home tomorrow so I'll at least won't
have to commute got my captain dangle
I've worked at NCIX for about six years
my favorite mechanical switches are
blues but the exception being reliable
60 the blacks feel better and different
on that one um no you won't see slick I
will ya know slicks in the I'm not
linked weekly show he's in we
interviewed him than one of them he does
wear a bag on his head but that's about
as close as we're gonna get I think
you're the reason i started youtube you
started youtube wow that's outstanding
and no i'm not doing this every day the
only reason I'm doing it today is
because I screwed up and everyone
thought I was Dean you today and I
wasn't actually primary as for my job
title and what I do at NCIX we covered
that in the episode 8 of net linked
weekly I actually interview myself
so yeah why just look high was
unprofessional for camera people to
chill on the camera they're supposed to
avoid reflections and avoid being seen
that's not that's not abnormal fine NCIX

store in Vancouver i'm actually at our
head office rumble is sleeping now see
