buggiest thing I've ever seen and I
really hope my default
audio input device is the microphone
right here and not the webcam oh come on
there we go let's see if new it's still
using the webcam so yeah sweet wonder if
there's anything I can do about this
right now
it's at my proper microphone positioning
okay yeah so basically I hadn't actually
decided if I was going to do any kind of
a live stream tonight or not I was just
testing a new webcam one that I've got
attached to the laptop so that I can
easily pick it up and I'll show you guys
what I'm working on or you know graphs
of performance numbers that are in
progress or whatever else the case may
be and then easily put it back so that
was sort of the concept of what I was
trying to figure out today and okay
that's not gonna work and so that
totally didn't work out for me because
what I did is I started the hangout on
air and then I never actually started
the broadcast so I assumed if I didn't
start the broadcast that it wouldn't see
I don't even have to blare this because
it's using the mic on the webcam which I
don't even know if it's working or not
so yeah so I didn't know it was
publishing to my channel because I
hadn't actually broadcasted anything and
then when I realized that a bunch of
people were tweeting me and asking me
when I was starting my hangouts like
what you guys talking about so then I
was like oh okay so I went to my YouTube
channel and there was it said on there
and it was just black it was just
waiting to start so I realized people
have been sitting here forever waiting
for the starting nothing was ever gonna
start because I didn't even know what
was happening so then what I did is I
closed the Google+ Hangouts window which
I thought would shut the whole thing
down but it
it didn't work at all so there's a lot
of people okay apparently I have a call
from slick right now so I'm just going
to take this because that's the whole
point of this like on-air thing right
yes hello sir I'm not that you are not
watching this are you yeah I know I'm
live streaming you called me to tell me
that I'm live-streaming when I'm sitting
here on a live stream ranting about how
the live stream doesn't work correctly
you wanted to troll me well you have
definitely achieved that just for that
I'm going to I'm gonna just take my
phone I'm gonna go like this I'm gonna
show them all your real name oh no you
no no no you hold on I'm gonna put you
on speaker speaker hold on okay okay so
slick slicks on speaker here now guys so
lastly why don't you tell them where
you're going this coming weekend sorry
sorry hold on hold on you're loud and if
you want add enough rate where you going
where you going
okay so anyone who wants to find slick
at PAX where would you find him
excellent and something to note is the
first person who finds slick I have
given him a special prize to give to
that person so you should go look for
slick if you're going to pax and he has
a special prize for you if you're the
first person to find him that is if he's
not lazy and he does actually bother to
take the prize with him okay I'm taking
out speaker so why are you guys dealing
tuned into this
okay so he's water-cooling is 800 d and
he just sort of happened to go on
YouTube and find out that that I'm Lodge
dreaming right now I'm working on that
Big Bang
mPower video right now here you guys can
move the camera so you guys can see what
I'm talking about
but yeah so thanks for helping me with
that by the way I realized that the the
release date is actually today the 28th
so I'm doing some benchmarks with it
actually the overclocking process on it
was really easy
it took about I don't know 15 minutes
total to get both the the motherboard
dialed in to 4.6 gigahertz and that gtx
680 lightning dialed into like a pretty
actually pretty boss overclock as well
so uh so overall things are going pretty
well anyway I will talk to you later
thank you for thank you for calling me
to inform me that I was lunch dreaming
because I couldn't tell that okay cool
bye
this guy kids today that's what I say
he's not even that much younger than me
to be perfectly honest so I don't know I
guess we might as well do a short
sentences everyone is bored and typing
random stuff in the comments I can't
even see the comments I don't even know
where to see in the comments other than
like opening up another tab and and you
know trying to make some sense of the
epic failure that is that is the
comments updating like 50 at a time and
I know you guys are telling me that I
should be using twitch TV and you're
probably right but it's not not in all
likelihood gonna happen for now just
because I don't really have the I don't
really have the follower base on there
like I do on YouTube so what you guys
think of this webcam versus the one I
was using last time okay now I see some
comments yay also somehow the yeah I
know there's Ustream as well but the
same problem as we have with twitch TV
where I don't really have
the I don't really help the follower
base there and guys if you do want to
send me a comment please use Twitter
because I just it's not manageable to
read the comments on the videos I'm on
twitter at Linus tech and cry Bosh says
can you say my name on the stream I'll
try I tried cry wash yeah so Linus tech
on Twitter make sure you're following
otherwise this is really really not
going to work so I don't know what else
to tell you guys at this point you have
any questions about the Big Bang and
power motherboard what CPU cooler is
that fascinating question that is
actually the be quiet dark rock tune or
something okay okay now the Twitter's
exploding
Tyler sagging can want to shove out and
I think the live stream just died a
slick said he's gonna be in the BYOC
section of packs that he's in he's gonna
be in the lead me to his friends for
streaming can we please see my little
rocket you know I don't know where they
are how long people see let me go see if
they're around if I can find live the
chance that kinda say
okay everyone say hi to the kitty this
is even still working yeah there it goes
from real delay going on there
- hi rumble he's not really sure what to
make of all this because we just isn't
my phone buzzing over there because
Twitter's going crazy
say hi to everyone
you can dance - dancing cat
everyone loves dancing cats on the
Internet okay have you had enough for
this okay he's leaving huh that was all
okay let's see if I can actually read
any of these questions fast enough to
answer them ah what fans would you
recommend for of course our h80 probably
not to our F series would be your best
bet 37 sunny what's up - of itch okay
and to a McDonald's run no no McDonald's
I already have McDonald's today it was
terrible to find him and win ask every
person there you know it's not that hard
because you can find you can find a lot
of pictures of him on sort of random
like reflections in the TV and whatnot
that's for the graphics card behind you
is quite a few graphics cards behind me
in case you guys hadn't noticed so
there's this one yeah something 7850
power edition from em aside 7870 hock
Edition which is also behind me here
I've got a sapphire 7950 with their dual
fan cooling so that's behind me I've got
a galaxy GTX its enemy that's behind me
technically these are behind me so I've
got a couple 660ti on a test bench one
of these is actually the one that I'm
going to give away on Twitter over the
next little while or so
I'm gonna set up like a scavenger hunt
or something so that people have to
people have to kind of like search
through a couple of different videos and
then search through a couple different
tweets and then find the solution to the
problem that is the question for me and
we can honestly guys I cannot keep up
with this like can NCI actually borders
to Malaysian no if I overclock my 79 78
gigahertz then thro gigahertz additional
crossfire will something I don't know
what got to cut off yes it'll probably
be fine
what does he send me said in other words
should I get no price limit I'd probably
go for the Maximus 5 formula to be
perfectly honest the one that comes with
the with that beast USB external sound
card what was my first computer well on
my first computer was my family's
computer because I didn't I didn't only
my first computer so that I guess
there's two different answers to that
question
the one where I say that my first
computer was a 286 actually no because
my mom had a Commodore at one point so I
didn't really use that one no and then
my first actual personal computer was a
Pentium 166 megahertz and I used it to
run Warcraft 2 which is awesome and yes
I will begin Windows 8 since my job is
to use all the latest stuff figure out
how it works and then try to educate you
people about it I don't really have a
choice I always have to use the latest
even if I don't necessarily prefer it
asks for one 680 versus 2 660ti is a
great question check this out I actually
filmed see see how this is crossed out
680 versus 660ti sli so well that's done
that's filmed that's coming soon so stay
tuned for that can you have free swag no
am i certified like like for STDs really
I don't know I don't understand I am NOT
saving up for Ducati I'm still really
happy with the SV 650 s I honestly
haven't had much time to write it this
year to be perfectly honest I'm super
disappointed about that
what is your view about hacking Tosh's
I've been meaning to try and get around
to building one at some point but I just
have not had the time at all
computer certifications no I do not have
any I am 100% self-taught basically my
my experience amounted to reading and
spending way way too much on this crap
and then just kind of learning about it
through trial and error your msi 570 has
a 42 cooler can you return it to NCIX
you know and we're free not my hair wet
no no it's just that there's a light
right here so you guys are catching that
reflection coming right off my head
which makes it look like my hair is
either wet or extremely greasy play
minecraft no I don't unfortunately with
babies there's not much time for sure
mine crashed EVGA SRX a good question
because it's ok Tyler Tyler salvington
stop tweeting the same thing over and
over again because you're just like
clogging up the feed like look how
quickly these are coming in am I
supposed to read this it's ridiculous
then there's my cat he was also
ridiculous he's nuzzling your phone
because that's somehow helpful MacKinnon
benchmark 279 90cm probably not um I
don't really have a way to get my hands
on that one
as for 7970 vs. 680 you know what it
doesn't really matter once you overclock
them both to the max it's pretty much
the same however if i was going to pick
a 680 i would definitely go with the
light ammunition one that I have in here
it does overclock better than those six
eighties how to get more views on
YouTube that's a very interesting
question
that's for Windows being awful the Linux
or go home yeah that's fantastic going
on Crysis 2 on Linux and then we'll talk
ok so getting more views on YouTube I
guess make interesting content and make
it regularly that's the best advice I
can really give you know your age 100
isn't going to leak max
five formula versus the PhD 777 G
premium I take the Maximus five just
because it has that beastly longboard
sound 500 RR and tech 1100 ah now I'd
probably go 1100 or 300 are $300 an
outstanding case and it's even cheaper
it's only about 70 bucks why don't you
get ads on my videos well probably
because you suck and you have adblock
which means I don't get any revenue so
there you go what do you want me to say
a JD well I'd be good no I probably
won't be getting an iPhone 5 unless this
is my work phone so this is an NCI
execute phone that's not like I paid for
it if they pay for an iPhone 5 then I
will happily use an iPhone 5 then I
won't have any complaints
as for reuploading video because I did
unboxings in two different Samsung SSDs
one was an OEM package and one was a
retail package and I thought I had
uploaded the one with the retail package
already that I had actually uploaded one
with a OEM package so I agree upload the
same one so that was that was my bad
updates on my personal rate you guys
really want to see nothing on my
personal rate okay here come with me
okay we're going into the side room
we're gonna need a light for this let me
turn the light around Rochester that's
my personal rig right there progress
being made exactly zero zero progress no
progress at all that is all so no I will
let you guys know as soon as there are
any updates on the personal rate but
just it hasn't been a priority right now
lots of crazy stuff going on some of
which I can't really talk about for now
but I would definitely talk about it
more later
what SSD should you get a lot of crucial
coarser and kingston definitely crucial
be my choice and before is a good drive
am I happy yes I am very happy thank you
how does the baby
baby has a lot to do with why I'm happy
although these are pain in the button
he's sleeping right now he's actually
sleeping through this which is great
this is awesome
Interactive YouTube you gotta know your
dot dot dot and then the tweets just
went away so yeah I wasn't able to do
anything um I know how a snowboard I
know how to ski I only snowboard maybe
once a year or so I mean I'm so close to
the mountains that it's there's no real
excuse for it I guess but it's just hard
to find the time I guess now there was
no coil line on the ice rock board that
was sort of the point of the video
no coil line but you do have an annoying
chipset fan so that's that's not
something that I'm gonna go for can I do
these more often I don't know I've
already done three in the last like four
days so I'm it's not like I'm gonna live
on YouTube do I have a baby
yes I do have a baby they're going to
come to Canada just to meet me okay so
em bus are at 45 I'm going to go ahead
and report you to the you know the
Mounties because that's what we have
here in Canada do I like Australia I've
never been there although I'd love to
scuba dive there that would be kind of
Awesome so for anyone who just tuned in
I guess I should probably clarify
anything you write in the comments for
this video I'm not gonna see it because
the YouTube comments are totally useless
so you're gonna want to tweet any
questions that you have at me
Linus tech on Twitter although you can
see how quickly the tweets are moving
it's pretty hard for me to keep up with
them there's only so much I can do
why do I read tweets in the lockscreen
good question because if I look at them
in them app manually then I will have to
drag it down and refresh every time and
I will always be way way way behind so
that's time actually answer a question
people will have long since moved on to
other things it was my favorite value
case probably three hundred are right
now although if you want to talk like
really cheap case I'd say the fractal
core 1000 just because it's super super
cheap and there's layout inside is very
smart breed of my cat is a bangle I have
two cats rocketing Rumble they're both
bangles
how many monitors do i
something-something buzz buzz buzz buzz
buzz you know what I'm gonna turn the
phone on silent so you guys can
appreciate how quickly these are coming
in what do you think about Remo drives I
think they're too expensive for what
they are you're far better off to just
run raid on a couple of stand-alone SSDs
550d versus r4 and got to be r4 for sure
as for Alex from MSI having your dream
job he works really hard by the way so
you know what's my view on Linux it's an
operating system it doesn't really run
games so yeah it's not that relevant to
me what's there to eat in Richmond right
now I'll go to silver Tower actually
it's like pretty decent Chinese food and
they're open late
I think 24 hours or at least very late
at night I often play there after
badminton which is it around this time
from back when I was able to do that
have I been to Europe yes I have I've
been to I flew to Amsterdam and then I
took a train from there after one day
this was my mom from my after my grad
and I stayed in Paris for two weeks and
then we went home - friends lifts are
dead used - can I give you a cat no
where's the NCI it's building wwe.com
slash contact us it's kind of there it's
a good speed for a cat and today you're
probably not happen soon have you ever
used an external - for really good sound
actually I'm using the ECC essence one
right now which is a headphone amp and
an external DAC when did you become
interested in computers how old are you
on 26 and I became interested in
computers when I was around 1980 when I
was interested in numbers for that but I
didn't really I didn't really really get
into it until later how do I manage a
full-time job in a youtube channel well
I think most youtubers other than the
really really big ones are probably also
working at a full-time job besides their
YouTube channel it's not that much money
you guys to be perfectly honest
unless your name is you know Philip
DeFranco or raywilliamjohnson you're not
really rolling in the rolling in the
dough our hard disk safe and permanent
so I have tons of shows well they're
safe and permanent until they die so
that's what rate is for not a use in it
under D for my personal build because I
don't like the under D as much as I like
the TJ o7 something about the razor
blade
what graphics card would you recommend
for a one thousand dollar build you know
what I'd probably try and find a way to
squeeze a 660ti in there ah what is your
job pilot in statics I'm a product
manager I'm also a category manager I
also oversee our PC division and I'm our
YouTube post so I have a bunch of
different positions greetings from
Sweden ah say hi to yen's for me no I
don't know which ends but I'm sure
there's a yen's that you know and he's
in Sweden I do know one yen's in Sweden
he works our fractal design are you
gonna come to Bosnia no thanks for
taking the time to do live shows you're
welcome really tired actually it's
probably getting to Busan to go to bed
turn your sound off yeah okay I'll turn
my sound I think I've proved my point at
this time all right at this point Guild
Wars 2 you know what I haven't played an
MMO since I played three months or since
I spent three months playing Wow and
then after three months I was like whoa
it's been three months and then that was
the last time I played in him in those
so Tyler I already did a shout out for
you relax
no I don't really have any plans to
visit Japan at a point in time although
I'll probably be in Malaysia ever die at
some point for my wife's family reunion
can you get a job at NCIX
you can email careers and instead XCOM
and find out greetings from Denmark
Logan mark you have good badminton
players congratulations
what's the best sound card
NZXT helmet and soir denote I still have
the helmet it's in my garage but I gave
the sword to the Russian so he actually
keeps it at work no I don't play csgo I
haven't seen Avengers yet that I did
quite enjoy The Hunger Games movie
Oliver it was apparently almost his
birthday holy crap this is going so fast
why isn't NCIX worldwide well there's a
lot of shipping and insurance and
logistical issues with with worldwide
detailing and there's sort of a reason
that NCI acts and a lot of the other
guys don't already do it so at this time
and today X only ships to Canada and the
USA I don't know tiny Tom Logan
personally actually I've never met him
he's on the East Coast and I'm sort of
on the West Coast we've never really
crossed paths hi Sam
what is the time the time right now is
136 in the morning Samsung or Apple what
is your opinion on Windows 8 you know
what I haven't actually used it yet
besides the consumer preview back when
they did it I did a video about it so
that was pretty much my thoughts about
it it was on the NCI XCOM channel okay
60 Hertz versus 120 Hertz ah very good
question so that video is coming really
soon
in fact we shot two videos so in one of
them we had one of Slick's friends who
he's going to packs with do a blind
taste test to see if he could tell the
difference and then after that one we
did a second video to see if I could
tell the difference between 60 Hertz and
120 Hertz so those are going to be
really interesting and those ones are
coming very very soon and Asher shemune
says shoutout done sir
my brother's name is actually Asher
believe it or not but it's spelled
differently a SH er not
you are I know people are still
commenting on YouTube there's nothing I
can do about that I can't read them in
time I can't even keep up with the
tweets so for those of you who are
watching on YouTube - tech on Twitter is
pretty much the only way you're going to
stand a chance of sending a message to
me because yeah you know what I have no
idea how any of the bigger youtubers
could possibly do this like the
communications unmanageable I'd love it
if there was a way for them to like for
people to thumbs up the best comments so
that I could actually sort of see which
are the ones that most people care about
but right now is just sort of very
difficult so do I like the new Batman
haven't seen it yet new baby happened
into a movie months yep sort of rough
Pentium 4 hyper-threading not sure not
sure where you're going with that
honestly the Twitter has even
accelerated at this point if actually
draining my battery really fast what's
the best actually I've had a couple
people ask sort of something along these
lines what's the best chipsets for
gaming or what's the best motherboards
for gaming the real answer is aside from
overclocking your CPU and your memory
although that doesn't really matter
either the motherboard is not going to
have an impact on your gaming experience
unless you well unless you for example
you know want a better sound card and
your motherboard has better onboard
sound and you might have a better
experience that way but in terms of
sheer performance it's not happening and
no I'm not doing a shout out for you
quit spamming the channel inappropriate
comments will be completely ignored just
so you guys are aware all the tweets
trade your baby for the best PC ever I
don't think I have to do that I sort of
have both already so it's not necessary
1080p vs. 1440p I think we can all agree
higher resolution is definitely better
I'd love to see some higher resolution
120 Hertz monitors that are you know
slim and no no pixel response time leg
or anything like that so uh SPI 1 3 4
yes this is how you talk to me thank you
for being new to Twitter good work
so I'm using our logitech 910 webcam no
warehouse sale is planned for the states
I haven't seen the CM storm striker I
don't know I don't know if my I don't
know if my baby needs a momma he needs a
computer yet he's four months old so
it's sort of a non-factor in the moment
yeah I love quake 3 I never played any
of the earlier ones I wasn't on the into
PC gaming at that point my baby is in my
personal rig update episode 8 part 8 so
he's he's definitely on YouTube already
so there you go monitor bezel videos I
don't think people are that interested
in the bezels of monitors not sure when
the next warehouse sale is what is rate
good question except that I do have a
few videos about that already
and track I'm gonna try something here
I'm going to see what happens if I
search for something on YouTube but can
I do that okay
something something bad videos you know
what I sort of give up on that you know
I can't figure out where to go back to
you let's go back to chat is that where
we were can we go back to camera thing
hmm it seems to be still working so I
know exactly what's going on here it
doesn't help that my windows small
mm-hmm Google Hangouts open that back up
and close the YouTube chat there we go
okay I give up on the YouTube thing but
if you search for like what is
on YouTube let's try that what is raid I
think uh oh wow I'm not even there
fine let's try a raid explanation haha
yes I am number one and number four hits
for that one so go ahead and check that
out if you're interested in learning
about raid surround gaming or one big
monitor personally one big monitor well
I can understand why people like
surround gaming it's mostly not really
my playing it's a really cool experience
but I find it a little bit overwhelming
POS our IPs right now sometimes the only
one with pls monitors and all the ones
they have are outstanding
how long am i streaming for I'm probably
pretty much done I'm pretty tired at
this point I'm rockin rumble T's I had
Rumble here earlier Here I am making
this a bit of everyone again if you guys
really want me there yes oh there's my
kitty so you can sit here with us for a
little bit Fox on New Zealand I don't
have any thoughts on New Zealand New
Zealand is a non-factor for me best 120
Hertz monitor at this point I think my
favourite has got to be the avenging
24:22 ex it's got less like that's what
pixel response times are very good
because there's more to it than just a
refresh rate the pixels are
transitioning fast enough and the
refresh rate isn't going to do anything
for you because you're going to have
crosstalk between the images are anyway
worth getting a 3d monitor it depends do
you like 3d then it's worth it
you don't like 3d then it's not worth it
we'll going too fast to read too fast to
read too fast to read review more value
products know what no one cares that's
not of a problem with value products I
can do as many videos as I want about
core i3 and kingston valueram and nobody
will look forward and nobody will watch
it so that's why that doesn't exist what
right feeds would you get with two
crucial armed force you'll have to sort
of look it up ensure it's on the
internet somewhere gtx 690 good force
around gaming yep although what I would
probably do is I grab a couple 674 gigs
or 660ti three gigs because the 690 is
limited to to the extreme buffer because
it's got only two gigs per GPU what
about raid max what about rednecks does
it matter
this cosmic Kenda what about raid next
what about wait max it's totally
irrelevant pinion on ducky keyboards
tera chemical they're good the only one
I've ever actually seen is slicks and I
like it why the Steve Jobs YouTube pick
because I think it's really funny well
we took that we took that picture when
we were shooting one of the episodes of
knowing tweekly and did you find a
mother worth your personal break know
like gigabyte has some new Mac 79 boards
coming so I'm hoping that one of those
will not have quail line and will not
have or anything like that
favorite keyboard neonics is I will 60
right now that's the one I'm using on my
personal machine over there it's shown
my face I feel self-conscious now
I'm not looking forward to unboxing
anything in the future I have about my
next two weeks worth of unboxing is
already filming the queued up so I'm
actually looking forward to a bit of a
break from unboxing anything no I have
no plans to do anything with the 79 that
I need I think they're making like 500
of them or something so it's not that
relevant as like something something
something going so fast going so fast
baby's name won't be won't be something
that we're talking about for now my
favorite food is okay I can tell I'm
tired because I can't actually think put
my finger food ringer I guess I'd have
to say teriyaki chicken burger at Red
Robin it's hard to beat that have I
tried arrest him I tried and I failed
and I work tomorrow yes I do
however I'm going to be working from
home tomorrow so I at least won't have
to commute got my cat's a bangle I've
worked at NCIX for about six years my
favourite mechanical switches are glues
but the exception being the SciVal 60
the blacks feel better and different on
that one
no you won't see slick yeah well yeah no
slicks in the I'm not linked weekly show
he's in we interviewed him in one of
them he does wear a bag on his head but
that's about as close as we're gonna get
I think you started YouTube Wow
that's outstanding and no I'm not doing
this every day the only reason I'm doing
it today is because I screwed up and
everyone thought I was Demian today as
for my job title and what i do at NCIX
we covered that in the episode 8 of net
linked weekly I actually interview
myself
so uh yeah - slick high was
unprofessional for camera people to show
on the camera they're supposed to avoid
reflections and avoid being seen that's
not that's not abnormal and Sachs is
cool asked for a shot up shoutout so
good work you are shouted I'm not in a
store in Vancouver I'm actually at our
head office probably sleeping now see
