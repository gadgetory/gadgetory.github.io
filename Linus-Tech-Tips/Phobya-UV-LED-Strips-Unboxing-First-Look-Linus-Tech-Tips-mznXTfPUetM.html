something that I'm very very excited
about this is the phobia LED flex light
now we've seen stuff like this before
it's an LED light strip it plugs in via
molex you can light your computer with
it bla bla bla
computer unique piece of art etc etc etc
integrated powerfully light etc ok no no
no no this is very exciting
so this is available in a variety of
different color configurations in length
so you can get them in 30 centimeter 60
centimeter 1 20 centimeter to 40
centimeters so this is anywhere from
pretty short to immensely long RGB warm
white white blue green red ho UV yes
unlike other competing products on the
market these phobia LED light strips are
available in UV these also appear to be
of the waterproof variety though don't
quote me on that but they're they come
in casings that why am i holding it up
to that camera I should be holding up to
the decent camera operated by someone
who knows what they're doing this is via
so you can see there's a silicone seal
around to cap pieces on either end so
even the one with the wire coming into
it seems to have some kind of a seal
going on however you can see those wires
are somewhat bare so I don't know that I
would necessarily take this and submerge
it in coolant immediately although you
know what why don't we just not test
that that's not really what we do on
this show getting ourselves sort of
fried you know we weren't done with the
close-up look they'll actually come back
so this is an extremely high quality
sleeving being used on here even though
the wires inside are colored you can not
see the color of the wires which is
pretty darn impressive have you got a
nice close-up of that diesel alright
awesome and then it plugs in via 3 pin
adaptor oh cool so you can power them
off a fan cable this is something I
haven't seen before
that's outstanding so you can run these
to every corner of your case without
actually running wires and then it just
includes an adapter that
it's a sleeve nice beautifully sleeved
4-pin molex to other more different
molex so you can daisy-chain them that
will also power one of the LED strips so
we're going to go ahead and plug this
bad boy in to a system here so let's go
ahead and click the thing and remember
guys always power the system down before
plugging in any accessories or
peripherals because this can reduce the
risk of shorting out components or
anything else sort of generally bad
happening remember guys do as I say not
as I do all right
there we have it so guys for those of
you who think well the cameras really
don't pick up that light very well but
trust me it's not here I'm just going to
put this down so that maybe the
half-decent camera operator can have a
look at it remember guys UV lights are
not purple lights they are UV lights
they're not intended to cast a
particular color in your case but they
are by nature somewhat purple looking
these are extremely bright and I am
super stoked on getting these installed
in my case on a bit of a UV nut now they
look kind of pink in the in the video
we're taking right now but don't mind
that that's actually not how they look
in person they do look more purple I'm
about to cut across the camera so that I
can turn off the lights so I can give
you guys some idea how they're reacting
with the pink slick with some of the UV
reactive components we have here so this
is one of those old BFI land party
cables so I'm going to go ahead and show
you guys what that looks like under the
UV light so without the UV light you can
see it doesn't look like a whole lot
well that now it's completely dark good
work guys there we go so UV light shows
that the the yellow cable lights up like
a beast this is sort of a pink ninja
star thing that I got a sort of a gag
gift at one point so that's lighting up
extremely nicely even at a distance so
I'm holding it about 15 centimeters away
this is in complete pitch blackness from
the UV components that I have here and
it's still lighting them up quite well
this is about 30 centimetres away so
we're still getting a fair amount of
light on them in fact I'd say diesel
should probably if there's a way bump up
the to represent more like what it looks
like in real life yeah that's probably
more like what it's looking like in
real life right now there we go so these
are some Swift tech coils from back in
the day when they made those so that's
that's an extreme that's at 30
centimeters away guys and then finally
over here we've got some primo flex LRT
tubing so these this saw tubing isn't as
glowy as sort of some tubing out there
but if you get a little bit closer so
this is it about 15 centimeters away you
can see it's got a pretty strong UV
effect there and last but not least on
the motherboard behind me here I have
one of Intel's blue SATA cables that
they include with their with their older
bad axe boards I think that's where I
got this thing and you can see that
that's quite UV reactive as well so
what's exciting about this guy's is the
fact that here let's switch to the other
camera let's see how this goes oh and
the lights are all dead now that really
didn't work very well at all I was
planning to point the UV light at myself
in order to sort of have some light on
myself that would look somewhat good umm
the exciting thing about this is unlike
UV cathodes we are not limited to having
to have stiff tubes so you can run them
into the little nooks and crannies of
your case also they're powered by 12
volt so you don't have to deal with
having inverters which are quite large
to convert from DC to AC power all over
your case in order to get UV lighting
they're slimmer profile which means
again you can fit them into places that
you can't do with cathodes and also they
are much less likely to die over time
every cathode I've ever bought and
that's like at least 30 has either died
or faded over time especially the UV
ones because the UV light causes the
glue to break down at the ends and so
the the square pieces at the ends
actually just start coming off after
you've had them running for about a year
so it's just not a very good user
experience I am hoping that these LED
versions will be significantly better
and when I redo my personal build which
is coming soon I am definitely going to
be using these instead of cathodes based
on the experience I've had with them
