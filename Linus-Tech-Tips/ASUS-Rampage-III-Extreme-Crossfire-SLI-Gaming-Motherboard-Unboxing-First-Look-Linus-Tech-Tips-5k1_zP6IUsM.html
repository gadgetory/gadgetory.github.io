the motherboard I've received more
requests for an unboxing for than any
other board in the history of my channel
so let's start with the actual
motherboard itself the basic features it
is a rampage series board so that means
it is part of their highest tier of
motherboards even within the Republic of
gamers brand so it's a 1366 motherboard
it supports LGA 1366 of course including
Intel's latest six core processors so
you got support for all core i7 extreme
as well as all core i7 1366 CPUs you've
got support for SLI and crossfire up to
3-way but that gets a little bit more
complicated and I'll tell you more once
we get the board opened up the box is
huge and comes with a window so you can
see the motherboard on the store shelf
you can see they've got we'll talk more
about the board after so basic features
you've got there ROG connect so you can
plug the motherboard into another
computer and overclock with the other
computer you've got extreme engine digi+
so that means you've got digital PWM USB
bios flashback more on that in a little
bit and it also includes some bundled
software 3dmark Vantage and Kaspersky
antivirus now this motherboard actually
introduces besides that USB BIOS flash
feature two pretty unique ways to flash
the BIOS so one is just by loading the
BIOS onto a USB stick plugging it into
the back of the motherboard and then it
just automatically flashes and then the
other is the two separate BIOS chips
which can be flashed with two different
settings or they can be set with two
different settings and you can flash
from one to the other in order to
actually maintain two completely
different overclocking profiles like you
could have one for 24/7 and then one for
whenever you're you're doing some
extreme benching or whatever and then
you can automatically go back to your
old one you've got a 3-way SLI bridge
included you've also got a well I think
this is that little Bluetooth thing yeah
this is a Bluetooth module so comes with
Bluetooth that's pretty cool then you've
got whatever's in here which I will find
out what it is for you okay we got a
couple screws and then we got some
bubbles and then we got a
little fan okay now we'll have to find
out what that hooks up to you can see
it's like an anodized red heatsinks so
that's probably what the heatsink on the
motherboards finish is going to look
like they've actually applied a proper
thermal compound and a reasonable amount
of it I'm really impressed to see that
most modern motherboard manufacturers
don't get that detail IO bracket with
two USB and 1 eSATA then we've got one
two three four five six seven eight SATA
cables for our right angle for our
straight we've got the rog connect USB
cable then we've got an i/o shield we've
got some zip ties we've got there oh
this is good Pro belt that's another
feature it includes so you've got little
leads that you can plug into all of the
voltage monitoring points on the
motherboard to make it easier to plug in
your multimeter you've got their two
connectors one crossfire bridge and then
one long SLI bridge we've got some
temperature sensors and last but not
least we have the rampage extreme user's
guide with some labels for the SATA
cables as well as the drivers and
installation utilities DVD don't use
that download the latest offices website
then we have a Republic of gamers
sticker so let's get all that back in
there and let's get the motherboard out
so one thing that stands out to me right
away about this motherboard is while
EVGA and gigabyte are tripping over
themselves and each other to release
motherboards that are not a standard ATX
form factor as soos has opted to stick
with the ATX design for this particular
board you can see they've gone a little
bit wider so it's more like an extended
ATX than a standard ATX but they keep
the standard 7 slots rather than making
the board longer at the bottom and I
really like this for a number of reasons
the first of all the first of which is
that it means it can fit in many more
cases than these these non-standard
boards and also if they put the
engineering work into it and you can see
that they have they've got the first PCI
Express slot right at the top it means
there's a lot of components packed in
there but even
with this standard ATX board you still
get all the benefits of up to 4-way
crossfire or four-way SLI these slots
will run at 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X and if you
have a case like the Corsair obsidian
800 D that doesn't have an 8 slot but
does have a vented port at the back you
can actually install a dual slot card in
here so you'll go to 2 2 &amp;amp; 2 so you can
use a standard ATX board to get that
extreme feature as long as you put the
engineering work into it which is Zeus
has why don't we start with the CP or
rather move on to the CPU socket so it's
a standard 1366 socket there's not much
to say about it but they have included
holes for 1366 as well as what appears
to be 775 so if you have an old cooler
and a lot of the extreme overclocking
guys with their liquid nitrogen pots
won't have newer Hart mounting hardware
you can definitely use that to mount it
there over here we have got 2 8 pin CPU
connectors so that means that this
through its digital PWM is able to pump
a lot of juice into your processor
you've got to be going pretty far over
stock speeds for that to be a benefit
but hey that's what this board is for
we've got the clear CMOS button right
here as well as one here so you've got
one on the top of the board if you're
using it on an open bench as well as one
on the back panel very convenient
thank you a soos for that then we've got
our support for up to six dims so that's
triple channel memory we have our
onboard switches there's our start and
reset and then we have little boy okay
well I wish I knew what those do but
please leave a comment if you know what
these do they are on-off switches right
here they are labeled switch one two
switch four very cool okay oh this is
interesting
there's a liquid nitrogen mode up here
and it appears to be the jumper right
here so they've actually got a special
liquid nitrogen profile for this board
and I'm guessing what it does is it
controls the the timing of the
electrical signals for if the board is
going to be really really cold okay here
we've got our 24-pin connector in its
ideal location and then we move down and
we see our SATA connector so we have two
SATA 6 gigabits per second connectors
here
rather yeah 2 SATA 6 gigabits per second
and then 6 SATA 2 so say 2 3 gigabit per
second connectors here then we have the
bios switch right here we have one more
SATA connector then we have our front
panel connectors here are the two BIOS
chips so all you have to do this is so
cool is press the button and then you'll
actually load one BIOS profile or the
other one here is the plug-in for their
OC station which is a dual five and a
quarter inch Bay device that you can
plug into the front of your case for
some hardware overclocking next we've
got and I like this this motherboard has
all four pin PWM fan connectors no
legacy 3 pin fan connectors and it has a
ton of them one two three let me see
let's just keep counting here I got four
I've got five six seven seven fan
connectors so you can load a ton of fans
on here that's pretty cool next we have
a molex connector at the bottom so this
is to provide additional power there's
actually two of them and I'm glad to see
this one in a very sensible location
here because usually you see a lot of
bottom mounted power supplies these days
and then there's one more up here so
that's going to give you additional
juice for your graphics cards if you're
running for high powered cards in here
let me see what else we've got there's
your front panel audio connector as well
as your BIOS battery and last but not
least we've actually got one more clear
CMOS jumper so you can do it the
old-fashioned jumper way or you can hit
either of the two switches up at the top
of the board
now let's have a look at the cooling
solution now the x58 chipset as well as
the ich10r southbridge they don't really
run that hot it's not really necessary
to throw a whole ton of cooling at them
but if you yeah you know what that's
basically it if you want to a soos has
included an extra heatsink which you can
see straps in right where this this
piece comes off so you can leave it
passive because you don't need all that
cooling or you can throw an additional
one on here and you can get that
additional additional cooling if you
want it if you're going to be pushing it
even harder so that's a you know what
the spacing actually looks right for
Swift Tech's water block that can mount
here
as well so it looks like a soos has
continued their tradition with their
high-end Republic of gamers boards of
allowing them to be water-cooled with a
third party piece that's pretty neat as
well and the cameraman is probably
having a look at the like black angular
heat sink I really like their new style
and their Republic of gamers boards have
been typically black and red they've
done an exceptional job of making this
board look like something you'd really
want to put on display in a windowed
case so why don't we have a look at the
oh yeah let's have a look at the back of
the board look at that so they've got
the standard backplate for the CPU
socket but they've also got a cooling
heat spreader for the back of the pwms
so that's something you see on the back
of boards from time to time but not
really all that often last but not least
let's have a look at the i/o
connectivity at the back so we've got a
ps2 keyboard port we've got one two
three four five six USB 2.0 ports this
is not a true USB port that is the rog
connect port so that can be used to
flash the bios in that innovative new
way you plug in the USB with the BIOS on
it you'll hold this for two seconds and
it flashes awesome next we have a clear
CMOS switch here optical audio out eSATA
firewire Gigabit Ethernet this is you
know what this is one of those things
again I have to comment on I'm so sick
of seeing gaming motherboards with like
- or I've seen up to four Ethernet
connections on the back why
gamers need one Fast Ethernet connection
that's all so that's a yeah just random
rant then we have two USB 3.0 ports as
well as 7.1 audio thank you for checking
out my unboxing and product overview of
the much-awaited
a soos rampage 3 extreme</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
