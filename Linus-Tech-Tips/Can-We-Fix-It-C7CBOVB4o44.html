correct trips what what do you think he
changed can you hear anything from him
speed test is good okay let's pretend
like he's not working it's still not
working okay just kidding it works all I
did was unplug it and replug it that's
weird
so what would not work right now
well Wi-Fi doesn't work what else does
not guest Wi-Fi I mean guest Wi-Fi
should work so here's a question for you
guys do you want to go for like another
two hours and possibly be done that's
why we can get dinner
dinner ok gameplan time its gameplan
time we got my lovely assistant here's a
portal I would use a pencil no ok so
stuff to do
what is this okay what's not working do
we know Wi-Fi is working no idea guest
Wi-Fi
yes Wi-Fi fix VLANs set up monitoring
for network devices and servers right
isn't this episode brought to you by
pulse way pulse way is a real-time
remote monitoring and management
software that allows you to manage and
monitor from one app compatible machines
that run Windows Mac OS or Linux you can
get access to real-time status reports
system resources logged in users network
performance Windows updates and more and
you can fix problems on the go by
sending commands from any mobile device
we got to install that replacement part
in the UPS where is that yeah about that
what they didn't respond to me I thought
you said it was out here yesterday when
I asked you about it no you didn't you
didn't ask me at all
I think the footage will find that I in
fact did I contacted Eden yeah it was
the US Department so they were like oh
well you need to talk to the Canadian
Department contacted them radio silence
yeah well we need to just get it from
the US guys then just provide them in US
address us card whatever it takes
we just need to well then call them back
again don't tell him you're in Canada
that's like what we're doing this
weekend well I mean the modules easier
please pass through ten gigabit steam
cash we need to get the dumping ground
set up to delete files older than a
hundred days is the Mac Mini done it's
going up today it's okay yeah we're
using a Mac Mini for wiping SD cards
we're not just wiping the SD cards we
also need the 10 gig connectivity in
order to okay all right I'm gonna start
by installing servers cuz I think we're
kind of at that stage now okay here I'm
gonna get a colored sharpie not to write
on Linus so I can just put the funny to
death right well no is that not a thing
no Brandon already said this is fine if
we just have another monitor here is
that gonna be a problem
Edge's yep
that wasn't me David why do you drop
that so from time to time we have issues
with the ingest software's that are
available on PC or there are human
errors that come in and interrupt our
backups so a lot of more reputable but I
don't know if they're better we haven't
tried them yet but a lot of ingest
solutions are available for Mac because
a lot of productions use Mac we're also
going to experiment with using a
dedicated station as our wiping station
for cards in addition to transferring
the data wherever it's supposed to go
you will also take your card out and
anytime it's time to wipe a card you
must do it in the dedicated wiping
station including a full copy that way
in the event that the initial ingest
didn't work theoretically there should
be at least two copies of the file
somewhere so that's why we're doing this
here's the thing I've plugged in all the
ethernet cables from the patch panel so
these are all the ones there like I know
what they are but a lot of this stuff
that's just hanging into the room is not
labeled this is not even terminated
oh god my boy Mickey Mouse he's a good
guy really weird cable don't know why
people use it I guess it's for things
that need to be small wow this is
actually way too long
hey - yeah you have a you have an ETA on
what we're gonna have the server's back
up why oh my god we have to upload
today's video don't we yeah oh my god oh
damn it you guys kind of got other stuff
to do one thing I'm pleased about now is
that I get to move Warnock to be
oriented correctly above ruskin
I got this no I got this
lift Isaac : task right workplaces yet
many employers may not be aware of how
to reduce the risk associated with
lifting bending it's out twisting while
lifting can result in back pain back
injuries is painful and can be
debilitating I'm not gonna lie I grabbed
this monitor looked at the back of it
and was like that's DisplayPort it
wasn't display smart
it was HDMI so I went and grabbed a Type
C to HDMI adapter but there's just HDMI
on the back of the Mac Mini you know why
am i doing all this work I don't know I
should just give up I'm gonna go get a
keyboard now so far I am not getting a
signal out of it it should at least know
that it's plugged in unless it just came
look oh my god
okay and that is why you do screw in VGA
haha I want a cz Drive show me a Z Drive
show me oh god it's full you can't even
ingest to this so I needed a keyboard
right I'm like yeah get some nice
Logitech goodness you know when you're
clicking clacking this is not a Logitech
keyboard what is that doing in there
this is a Coolermaster so connected to
the guest Wi-Fi
I've got no no IP no internet no nothing
oh right now it's not working let's see
if we can figure out the easier way to
do guest Wi-Fi hmm handling heavy loads
or rotating the same motions can also
increase the risk of injury I made a
screen protector well it's not really a
screen protector it's market case for
the Mac Mini with painters tape this is
very nice
artisanal painters tape definitely not
from Home Depot and so the goal of this
is that I can put that on top of there
well BAM she's done they got a little
excited again
maybe you are a Mac haha Wow Hey look we
got to pulse way notification says that
Wanek server is back online
yeah neat huh yeah so now we just need
to install it on all the servers yes all
right
it is very fine yeah yeah I need a
haircut that's why Dave can you find
something useful to do you way to live
waiting for you you may be let's go
check it twice I can put this in on my
own oh my gosh I'm changed all default
passwords I don't know how what
passwords need to be changed I don't
know any of the IPAs and stuff you could
ask hey what's my piece just stop
yanking it I like yanking thing okay
here just hey David is a huggable did
you hear that that's a shame
this is awful yeah you are pretty oh who
installed this a company you probably
paid thousands of dollars to can you
imagine like the way they must have to
have those kinds of conversations on
like a porn set like hey if you could
just like you know Jam your knee over
there then we'll be able to you know see
the you know the action better so
today's video apparently it needs to be
reposted to youtube but it is not
currently on the server because it's
been pushed back a lot so it's on the
vault Oh
when does this have to go up what time
is it looking 42 oh my god ok well then
we need to get the ball back up going
since when are there are you sure it's
on the vault I don't know why don't we
look at Wanek look I don't know can I
just have the transferred server oh I
need the nail but what nailed it that
looks dangerous as heck should be fine
just get in it's not going here to get
in the hole oh let me just push it does
this thing no no stuck on there okay I
push it back yeah
can you change the angle a little bit
like put yeah that way yeah there we go
okay now try just Ram it in there until
he goes till she chooses I love it
hey Linus you disconnected the Wi-Fi
like the Holt like now yeah like I don't
have access to the network let alone the
internet like and it just went down now
like around the time you got this back
up what the hell here I'll plug it into
21 okay so this is working all right so
there's a little trick to booting the
vault when booting press escape then
after 90 second timeout control D
immediately you have to do that because
there's kind of a glitch if you have 60
drives in it it like times out while
it's trying to detect them all and then
the OS fails to boot are you excited
install pulse wait on this they have a
sentiment buy it yeah oh cool regular
Linux is pretty bare-bones just in case
you wanted all your packages to be out
of date hit up sent to us I need to get
access to that network connect here
switch it's not coming up I removed the
VLANs that shouldn't have caused any
problems but it did so you have to plug
into it directly yeah I think so okay
okay so here's the thing the disks are
showing up but the the screen on the
front says okay zero out of 32 zero out
of 28 isn't it supposed to say 32 out of
32
all we did was reboot in and renew our
entire network that's more than it
showed before yeah it's like four out of
ten working wait hold up hold up just
give it a sec why is this empty
young man Brett we need a POA injector
which i think is passed to jake here
look just actually where do we keep the
POA injectors I don't know there's
probably a like a box of them somewhere
you ain't the Manliness so remember that
stupid Network stupid video monitoring
proprietary stupid box it's not a
standard one you I can't even screw it
into the rack so it's just gonna like
sit here I guess but now this switch is
not working we factory reset it we can't
manage it with the cloud where is the
cloud key oh the cloud keys down here
this isn't even lit no wonder you can't
access the cloud key the good news
though the vault and the transcode
machine are 10 out of 10 working right
now small victories so we have the
factory reset again mm-hmm this time we
recept the cloud key as well so I mean
what is the default at all what
okay so installing pulse wave is
actually really really damn easy you go
to their website you click downloads
we're on window so we're gonna take the
windows 64-bit it's gonna download we're
gonna click on it and bam it's gonna
install look at that BAM I needed like
five more clicks than I said but there
you go
what BAM did it work all those those
camera movements I go crazy cuz she look
like a flower and she sting like a bee
shebang one hour and 45 minutes that up
time minty button well I mean that was
on purpose that water-cooled server yeah
it's pretty dank temperatures Hey yeah
brother wait we can chat with the person
hold up right
so we can run it in VMs as well then
yeah we could know if it articular VM
goes now okay so we need to get then we
need to get Albion in here and get all
of our VMs pulse wait hours oh we need
to do the ten gigabit so do we have the
cards already theoretically there's okay
let's figure that out okay so here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna let's
just lift it up a bit and then just kick
the card out rather than trenni like I
don't think that was necessarily any
easier but sure that's how I did I pick
this side I don't know so this has so
many hard drives oh I was like shoddy
shoddy that yeah go for it you guys
should be dropped this oh oh oh yeah oh
yeah put it in there Oh stick it in it's
so tight oh hold on hold on this dongle
is in my way here we're gonna go wait
just wait that seems to be in go point
oh yeah girl boy whatever yes he is I
don't know whatever is the base server
hard and then it was easy I don't know
one special this one's deeper than all
the other servers yeah yeah was I wrong
when I said she's a vet girl no we
didn't cheap out on the thickness so
slow why do I pay you
am I missing one of the cables for this
one I don't know okay so we're back on
the bare metal export I'm gonna set up a
couple notifications here so we know
what's going on with this thing yeah if
you get to know if Adobe Media encoder
is closed can we do that if it's closed
whoa that's on priority elevated but it
might go not responding wild some coding
yeah all right sure looks to critical
why not yeah can we hear maybe just done
kinda pose this it's not doing anything
right you would know right David also a
critical Adobe Media encoder stopped on
computer BM export it works oh really
that's awesome
yeah let's see what other servers we can
put this on is if there's any oh we can
put it on clover choose your keyboard
layout
it says reset your PC or C Advanced
Options
I'm just gonna click turn off your PC it
was in startup recovery mode
oh really here I'm gonna try to turn it
on again that's just the backup one
right yeah okay
so solder has nothing important on it
except everything pulse wave monitors
are servers so we know if they die
because that's unfortunate when that
happens okay so obviously the install a
pulse away on Linux is a little bit
different so that's gonna vary between
you know a bun - or CentOS or whatever
you're gonna have to change how you go
with the initial install but that's on
the website that's easy to do once we do
have it installed though we just want to
go into etc' pulse way c deg c pulse way
now that were in there we can see that
there's a sample config file so all you
have to do is copy the sample config
file remove the sample bit and then now
you can edit the config and enter all
your information so once we enter our
username and password it's obviously
gonna encrypt the password and then
inside this config file you can go ahead
and enable all the things like we did on
Windows just in a text file instead of a
GUI this isn't a great example of how
easy pulse way isn't to install because
Slackware which is what unread runs on
and what our server here runs on is a
little more complicated than most Linux
distros most of the time on linux is
really easy you go that config file you
start the service and you're done so
this is a bad example anyways it's
working now you can see start pulse way
daemon so I figured out why clovers not
booting it looks like the seamless
battery is dead to give you some idea
how pants on head ridiculous super
micros BIOS crap can be sometimes I had
to take pictures of all the
configuration pages on this stupid thing
because like s SATA versus theta and
which one is is which is actually
different from one of our Super Micro
Machines to another so I just need to
make sure that these all match so stupid
because we factory reset the cloud key
you no longer have ownership of the APs
so we need to adopt them do you know the
password for those
as far as I know we never had one it's
just let's just blow up everything blow
it up
is there even space in there yeah I
don't what is f get it
think about Google s they say that so
it's gonna be like did you mean Sato no
it's just a super mikro thing it just
means through lean on chipset controlled
say that controller yeah except that
sometimes it doesn't do you like
pina coladas and you don't drink do you
like pina coladas all right there all
right mojitos I just go home whoa hold
on a second there why are those
configured to be non-raid disks give me
these are raid settings right okay so
now that we've added a 10 gig card to
the steam cache and it actually shows up
you can see in here we got wired
connection one which is our regular
virtualized network adapter and then we
have the pass-through quanti a 10
gigabit which is awesome now we actually
have to set the IPS apparently I can't
have ipv4 for disabled that doesn't make
sense hopefully potentially
theoretically it should just start back
up and we'll be using our 10 gig NIC ok
it looks like this might have not worked
so that's cool we got a different IP
maybe what is the problem if I can't I
can't I blame you dated yeah
so I've hold the last of the extra
cables out of this room
and I am pretty much ready to just oh I
guess there's nevermind hold on Jake is
still working on the steam cash over
there maybe he has an update for us
maybe we can do a test on it I have no
update everything I'm going to my
desktop I am friend if an affair well I
mean we're doing it stupid but like at
the same time there's nothing preventing
anything from working at this point like
it's all just one big network nothing is
segregated everything should be
communicating but it's not I don't know
what to tell you that switch only has a
single connection to the Dell switch
that's it put up for the neck here it
doesn't have a connection to the Netgear
switch everything goes through the Dell
did we set the subnet on this properly I
don't think we did I bet you that's what
it is that's if anything I've learned in
the last three years it's almost always
user error so we'll see a user error
that you came to be Wow she's crazy
yourself hell yeah it's not set oh my
god this works again do you know how
many points I am above you right now
like holy Sh so it was the subnet thing
yeah so how many other devices on our
network are gonna be borked like that
like what about that to be changed the
access points are all the switches
updated with this new subnet yes
are there any VMs that aren't updated oh
yeah yeah so we should probably get on
that one okay so what we have left to do
we got to fix the cameras that's in
progress they're gonna do that fix the
key cards they're gonna do that but I'm
gonna go fix some subnet some things
which is super boring so you probably
want to see me doing that what what what
is it I'm saying I'm gonna go do this
but it's me super boring so we're
probably gonna film it oh oh
did you just POA your computer I think
so
and you know that's not like actually
funny really kind of fun it's like
actually be not funny it's like if we
just destroyed a laptop that's like four
thousand dollars it's not
why are you laughing that's fun no it's
actually not I remember these being kind
of unintuitive to figure out but I've
never heard of them frying something can
we plug I am Joey injector can we plug
it into the switch like in a non POV
port like in the neck here switch or
something sure okay so plugging into the
camera directly okay okay we're in so
okay so now what okay so what I can do
is make sure that it's on the right
network now we can try plugging it back
in and see if that works
fine hold on grab your gateway that's
not right well I mean that's what the
other ones were set to - okay so move it
over so here's our ghetto solution -
Keowee inject connect to the camera
anyway we shouldn't have to do that it's
plugged into a POS which we just I don't
okay so Yuri plug it into the yeah
okay so let's hit it again yeah it's
working its up okay so what we just need
to do that one at a time for all the
remaining ones what a pain in the ass
okay well it's not perfect but all the
server's are back up and running
performance looks fine the steam cache
is working which it wasn't before we
have enough 10 gig ports for everyone
upstairs and we finally have monitoring
running on our servers so it's not a
total loss it's just really not as much
as we wanted to accomplish but at 6:30
on Sunday like we can't be tearing
things apart now and have things not be
at least sort of functional and people
come in in the morning so we just got to
clean up and try to go to sleep tonight
without just like having visions of IP
addresses
hammering our brains
