supplies feature 80 plus gold efficiency
and their gold guarantee five-year
warranty click now to learn more look at
that we didn't do any unboxings in like
what I don't know almost a year and then
now all of a sudden it's like two
unboxings within a span of a couple of
weeks but this one is a little bit
different this isn't just a product this
is an experience I haven't actually
tried it yet but it was sent by Intel
and one of the accompanying shipments
was an X 99 deluxe LGA 2011 3
motherboard with support for quad
channel memory the latest haswell-e or
also known as Intel new
fourth-generation extreme 6 core okay so
haswell-e and so yeah I think I have a
pretty good idea of what's inside the
box it's also fragile so it's clearly
not rocks although it is a little bit on
the heavy side so let's find out what's
in here shall we it's extremely well
packaged with a nice soft sell soft
closed cell foam and also comes with
look at this look at the amount of
instructions in here you see that notice
there's like books worth of instructions
so there's like Intel Core processor
family for enthusiasts boost your
performance increase security better
connectivity and specs for all these new
fourth-generation chips and then what
else we got here so we've got Oh an
overclocking guide for haswell-e that's
gonna come in handy presumably depending
on what's inside
we've got introducing the x99 deluxe an
entire novel written by a soos alright
ah
there's an AC adapter yeah 12 volt okay
yes we got in here
ah yes extract it from the hole
16 gigs of crucial quad-channel ddr4
2133 1.2 volt memory so the advantage of
ddr4 memory over the existing ddr3
memory is that it runs at lower voltages
runs at higher speeds and looks much
uglier no I'm just kidding this is this
is pretty basic ddr4 there will be
enthusiast grade stuff from crucial as
well as other memory brands over the
next little while but there you have it
it's still ddr4 it's still high tech and
it's still 16 gigs of what will
presumably go with what we're gonna find
inside now I've made it this far already
I'm aware that there is a like
containment cylinder unit inside but I
have not yet actually opened it up so we
should get a good look at this thing
before we get started as anything else
oh okay well the little pull tab came
out so I don't know where we're supposed
to pull up at home but presumably it's
been pulled so there's that let's take a
look at this bad boy so on this way goes
up I got that right well I mean there's
feet on the bottom so if I couldn't
figure that out I'm probably an idiot
this way has some this actually looks
like hand finished these are cool this
definitely is more effort than Nvidia
put into their GTX 590 containers where
they ship them in ammo boxes that had
like a stencil spray-painted over the
top of it so yeah I got to give kudos to
Intel for presentation here that's for
sure there's a reset button on the back
let's just go ahead and press that and
then that is where the power jack goes
so okay I'm going to assume the Oh oh
that's a shame
up on the top you can actually see that
one of our one of our flappy tabs here
looks like it got damaged in shipping
hopefully whatever's in the containment
unit is not going to get out and give us
any sooner than we were already gonna
unleash it ourselves anyway this is the
shortest power cord I've ever seen how
are they expecting you to plug this
thing in does it reach it and it does
not reach to the floor someone gave me a
Power squid body okay no no it's okay
it's okay we got this I
right we have powered up the containment
unit and oh hello there's a ticking
noise body it's a bomb that's about the
best Doc Brown's voice I can do so I'm
gonna turn the red thing to match the
other red thing well this reminds me of
an old game loading screen the old game
experience continues look at that
lighting on the inside you gotta get the
top angle here check that out is it
smoking is it supposed to do that I
can't even see it because of the current
hey okay I'm moving to the other side
this is stupid I'm missing the show look
at everyone else gets to see it I think
that's probably the show does it need
help oh no it's got it's got it
it's alright yeah so in addition look at
them LED strips love it
so in addition to the to the ddr4 memory
and x99 motherboard this I wasn't
expecting there is also a 240 gig 730
series intel SSD these are fantastic
SSDs we've talked a bit
oh it's opened we've talked a fair bit
about these in the past probably for
quality assurance I'm assuming where
what's important about these is how
consistent the performance is across
various different types of workloads
even when you're hitting them extremely
hard so they're really great for raid
configurations SATA 3 all the usual
stuff and you get no mounting bracket
but you do get disk loading software
screws 5 I always like that it's nice
touch one extra screw in case you lose
one SATA and then a speed demon sticker
oh look the flood the flashing lights
are back boo boo boo boo
this is where the show really starts so
this one they did reseal so I guess I'll
need my trusty unboxing knife let's go
ahead and place this bad boy open and
inside here we find a chipmunk oh really
it's a CPU I was expecting a chipmunk so
inside here we get Intel's latest and
greatest I'm gonna have to check the
clock speed on the chip just to make
sure that it is what I say it is yes
latest and greatest core i7 59 60 X this
is an 8 core processor clocked at 3
gigahertz base 3.5 gigahertz boost it
has 20 megabytes of level 3 cache it's
runs on the all-new x99 chipset which
you've seen which has a lot of
advantages over the older z97 1 are not
in terms of up excuse me over the old
x79 one things like more native USB 3
ports more native SATA 3 ports more
feature support that board in particular
you can throw an add-in card onto it and
you can get support for Thunderbolt
something that was never available
outside of the Mac Pro on LGA 2011 and
then of course you get support for ddr4
memory running in up to a quad channel
configuration for pretty much as much
memory bandwidth as most consumers at
least for now we help me say this right
it's more than anyone will ever need
until the needs continue to evolve
speaking of needs who needs an 8 core
processor I would make the argument that
very few people need one but it's
definitely a nice to have especially if
in addition to gaming because we all
know that games don't use more than a
couple of cores at a time but if in
addition to gaming you want to I don't
know output video while you're gaming or
you want to stream while you're gaming
using CPU encoding for the best possible
quality more course is going to be a
benefit to you and that's where Intel's
latest enthusiast platform comes in it's
not like Intel's replacing the
mainstream 1150 platform this is just in
addition to that for people who really
want the cream of the cream well thanks
for checking out this fun little
unboxing big thanks to Intel for
providing this neat containment unit
unboxing experience thing it was pretty
fun to make
about I think that according to their
instructions for how to make the video
we need to hit him refer people to
Intelli / unbox where they can go ahead
and visit the pro performance website
and then I'm gonna tweet and Facebook
this thing like nobody's business thanks
for watching guys like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment letting me know actually
I'm not intel know what did you think of
of this as far as as far as cool
publicity stunts go you know was it was
it cool let them know what's up I don't
I like it I think it's cool put this all
back I wonder if you can Rican tain it
guys don't forget to support us we have
a support us link in the video
description you can buy a t-shirt you
can give us a month in contribution you
can change your amazon bookmark to
entire philia code and all of that good
stuff okay I pressed reset what bit okay
okay whoa whoa whoa I'm planning to like
make this part of like hard set or
something at some point because it's
super super cool we found we found the
piece so it looks like we can just glue
that back on no problem and it's gonna
be back to its former glory so pretty
cool
peace guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
