rapidly like it's only 250 to 350 bucks
for an ultra HD monitor or TV these days
but it takes a lot of graphics power to
drive them so how should you do it the
Xbox one X is being built by Microsoft
as true 4k gaming Sony is calling their
experienced native 4k land pro and
NVIDIA shocked us by reaching out about
doing their first-ever sponsored video
with us about their flavor of 4k gaming
which they're calling ultimate 4k let's
find out what they mean by that
okay so why should you trust an nvidia
sponsored video about their 4k gaming
solution because they have absolutely no
reason to be su no matter which team you
bat for there are a couple of things
that any objective person can agree on
about the gtx 1080 TI one it's kind of
pricey and two it's the fastest 4k
gaming card on the market and these are
both things that would be stupid to try
to lie about because they can be
measured objectively we'll be looking at
four games on five different platforms
the fastest console today the Xbox one X
a modern gaming PC equipped with a GTX
1080 Ti and three more older gaming PC's
equipped with the GPU ghosts of Black
Friday's past let's start by getting the
image quality comparisons out of the way
they're an important consideration but
they are also kind of apples to oranges
since the Xbox one X costs less than a
gtx 1080i by itself let's start with
forza this game runs smoothly at 60
frames per second on the xbox 1x thanks
to its use of dynamic quality controls
that actually adjust image quality as
you whip around on the track it's a
really impressive optimization technique
that is actually enabled by default on
the PC as well but if you have the
horsepower you can turn it off and it
will reveal some extras that would
otherwise be absent like Tufts of grass
rather than texture work and higher
resolution textures like you can see
here at the edges of the track shadow of
war meanwhile shows that while the Xbox
port does once again a really good job
of delivering solid visual clarity at 4k
the PC version unsurprisingly has the
capability of showing more detail and
using higher resolution textures and as
we'll see shortly it can do this while
maintaining a much smoother frame rate
okay neat then but I think that a lot of
people would agree that at this kind of
total system price difference more
detailed grass is a pretty tuft cell and
that would be fair but Nvidia actually
doesn't make any money if you buy a new
CPU and motherboard or whatever they
only sell graphics cards so why don't we
look at it a different way what if you
upgraded your old PC with one of these
to answer that question first we need to
see how exactly your old rig is holding
up right now so we tested our games at
1080p high 4k low and 4k high noting any
adjustments that we made to the presets
this way you can decide for yourself
whether the difference between Full HD
and 4k or low details versus high
details is worth it for you right away
we see a huge advantage in Forza 7 for
our current generation 1080 TI system
with our 4k low 97th percentile minimum
actually above the previous flagship 980
TI is average at 4k Ultra it actually
manages up to a hundred and twenty
frames per second meaning that on next
generation high refresh rate 4k displays
you could see even more smoothness
Middle Earth shadow of war shows us
another huge gain for the 1080 TI over
its predecessors even on our older
systems with 4k ultra winding up at just
shy of 60 FPS on average and a very
playable especially with the g-sync
display 97th percentile low of just over
40 on two pub G we've got a closer race
here at 1080p as the bottleneck is
mainly down to poor CPU optimization
moving on to 4k we've got great
performance at low and then when we look
at high details still great performance
that is some weak CPU optimization
destiny 2 shows a pretty familiar
looking graph with 1080p performance
predictably better but when we step
things up to 4k
we find that this is the second game of
the day to not only average higher than
60 frames per second but claimed a 97th
percentile of 60 as well solid now let's
upgrade those old systems if you're a
1080p high detail gamer the CPU
bottlenecking is real here though you
should bear in mind that we didn't
overclock any of these older systems and
you could expect significant performance
improvements in some cases as for our 4k
results well this is where Nvidia's
story here gets pretty interesting since
you're generally GPU bound when you run
at high resolution and high details our
last generation 4790k performs basically
on par with our 7700 K which is
architectural II very similar to the
vaporware six core 8700 K and then even
more impressively going all the way back
to a core i5 2500 K this was a 200 ish
dollar CPU from 2011 we saw performance
drops as small as 5 to 10 percent when
upgrading to a brand new top-of-the-line
card so what this means is that our
gaming experience is very similar
whether we buy a brand new system or
retrofit an old PC bringing the 1080
TI's higher 4k image quality and
performance much closer in price to a 4k
gaming console so there you have it
the path to 4k have been laid out before
you what do you guys think would you
pony up for a brand new machine would
you dumpster dive for a secondary box or
upgrade your existing one with a shiny
new graphics card or is a new game
console at the top of your wish list
this year let us know in the comments
below so thanks for watching if you guys
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description and
while you're down there you can check
out our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one as well as our
community
honestly man this video was like we
spent so much time on the screen cap and
on measuring the frame rates because
even though Nvidia does almost no
sponsored stuff with us we knew that if
we got even like one thing wrong you
guys were going to tear us apart and so
huh glad that's over</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
