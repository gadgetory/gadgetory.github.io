audio product from a soos it seems like
ever since they started producing
products under the zone our brand I'm
actually just walking over here because
I'm going to show you guys my personal
favorite sound card these days this is
the zone our sense which is any soos
sound card ever since they started
really producing products under the
sonar Brenda seems like a soos has
gotten a lot more serious about audio in
general so this is the Vulcan a and C
and a and C stands for active
noise-cancelling and their take on this
is that this is the first active
noise-cancelling gaming headset for
gamers so they're going for comfort and
immersive audio which are noble goals as
far as headphones go I'm a bit of a
headphone guy so I'm actually really
looking forward to trying these out I'm
not much of an active noise-cancelling
guy I have tried the beats although that
is the only active noise-cancelling
headphones I've used so maybe it was
just that implementation I didn't like
but I found just the the white noise in
the background more distracting than
anything else
so what else do they have to say for
themselves here active noise-cancelling
gaming headset no noise distraction oh
ok well they're okay they've addressed
that already for me apparently I'm going
to try it out though long lasting
comfort directional and clear audio
focus to win so 85% active noise
cancellation for high frequency computer
fan noise nothin well that's one thought
okay and then 30 decibel noise isolation
for low frequency human and
environmental noise cool long lasting
comfort lightweight complete over your
coverage ultra soft breathable cushions
with memory foam let's start opening
this up and then oh oh thanks
presentation here so they've got some
sketches from during the development of
the product as well as a view of the
actual looks like a carrying case of
some sort for the headset itself it was
actually really handy to have the
products come with something
that kind of like a shield shape here
okay what else did we find inside VIP
member warranty notice in like a billion
different languages as well as a
QuickStart guide which hopefully has
instructions like plug the thing into
the thing so what do we got here okay
battery cover so it does require
batteries I would have preferred to see
it use USB power but I guess that
doesn't work up to 40 hours with one
triple-a battery though so I guess
that's not too bad there are left and
right markings on the ear cups okay and
that's pretty much it shows you how to
install the battery and connect the
microphone audio cable so let's open
this baby up it's got their Republic of
gamers logo on the front alright so it
looks not bad in here actually so
there's the microphone uses like a shiny
red plastic and then a matte black
flexible piece okay so the microphone
positioning is actually looks like
there's ports here and here so it's not
directly so that you're talking into it
so if you breathe shouldn't have too
many problems with like staticky
sounding noises on the other side so a
slightly indirect mic input is actually
my preferred method anyway so look it
comes with an airline adapter okay sure
why not
I mean usually they're available for
free on the flight but thanks a seuss
what else we got here so we've got oh I
see what they're doing so they've
combined the microphone and the
headphone cables here so you can see
these are the ones with the two bands
and this one has three bands so it's
actually carrying separate signals see
that okay so it all goes into the
headphones with one port now we get to
the headphones themselves so these are
very very slick looking so they're
folding as you guys already saw so you
can fold them either way this way or
that way okay once they've snapped into
place it's actually not that easy to
accidentally move them here I want you
guys to have a look at that mechanism
because it's actually made of metal
which i think is a very positive thing
see that so when it clips into place
it's just these bumps right here
slipping into place on the other piece
of metal so that should be quite durable
the sizing is also a
metal strip right there so you can see
it it has a wide variety of different
sizes so you can go all the way from
here to quite tiny actually this looks
really really small it's not going to
fit on my head so yeah so you fits like
that these pads use memory foam so you
can actually see how cushiony they are
they take a very very long time to
retract back which is great for
additional comfort these are also larger
much larger than they look so if you
have big ears see there's actually a lot
of space around the outsides here so
even though this looks really narrow
what happens is once I put my ear inside
its it's sort of um sort of like here
inside this cushiony area here so you
can see they're quite large when you get
them opened up from the side there okay
the top band also is using like a foam
but it doesn't feel like it doesn't feel
like but whoops sorry about that
just throwing things around here
hopefully it's alright okay so it seems
to use more like a more like an air
cushion because I can't even compress oh
no there it goes okay never mind
yeah that's memory foam you can see how
long is taking to come back out okay so
let's have a look at the size we got
like a soos shiny Cromie logo here you
got like a carbon fiber look on the side
I don't think that's actual carbon fiber
but you know how it is we've got a
switch for the active noise-cancelling
so hopefully they work even if you're
not using the active noise-cancelling
actively then we've got the input for
here we go so this is where the
microphone goes right there and then
that is where the input goes which is
right here so I'll go ahead and plug
that in now it's completely setup don't
forget guys you've also got inline
volume control which is right here with
a little dial on the side as well as
your microphone mute right there alright
so let's put these on and I'm going to
thread it oh ah button right here to
install the batteries doesn't come with
batteries but I'll have to track down a
triple-a in order to try these out here
there we go let's see if I can spend a
couple minutes here and evaluate the
comfort actually these are really comfy
they're not really that light like they
they sue says yeah they're really
lightweight and they're reasonably
lightweight like they're not they're not
heavy headphones but they're not super
super light either like something like a
SteelSeries Siberia v2 is definitely
lighter they're a little bit bulky in
the ears but I mean the materials
they're made of are just heavy there's
not a whole lot you can do about it you
put all that thick foam on there it
actually starts to add up and then once
you start adding like batteries and
things like that then it starts to get a
little bit on the heavier side however
the top head bed is quite comfortable
it's very very cushiony so even though
these aren't broken in at all they are
quite comfortable although I'll have to
actually lets you know what give me a
second I'm going to try these guys
obviously how they sound so I've spent a
little bit of time with them now it's
funny because Asus is literature claims
that this actually is carbon but rugged
carbon shield I just I just don't know
if I buy that I think the whole thing is
definitely not carbon because if you
look at the back that's that's like
definitely plastic but maybe I can see
where the material kind of changes here
so maybe it's a very thin labour layer
of carbon um although what I can tell
you guys I've gone ahead see there's a
little red LED so that's what that's
what lights up when you turn on the
active noise-cancelling it really works
so besides these headphones being quite
closed like I'm I'm having a hard time
hearing myself talk right now actually
at music playing into which which isn't
helping matters but in addition to that
once you turn on the active
noise-cancelling then it it blocks out
more noise I had my assistant today is
helping me film these videos just try
speaking to me in the same voice and
then the same voice again and I also
tried holding because one of the things
they sue says it's best for is blocking
out the noise offence oh I tried holding
my head next to the fans that are on
this computer over here
and turning the active noise-cancelling
on turning it off and seeing how much of
a difference it made it makes an
enormous difference now if you're going
to be using these with like quiet music
you're going to play games quietly then
you'll find the active noise-cancelling
like like I often do kind of bothersome
because there is a definite hiss to it
there there is because that's what
active noise-cancelling is it's instr
it's inserting white noise so that it
blocks out some of the noise around you
however they are functional unlike beats
without the double-a battery and without
the active noise-cancelling on so that's
a very good thing which means you can
use them without and they still do have
a very noise isolating design overall um
and if you're listening to things louder
then it becomes far less noticeable
which is definitely a good thing as well
I'd say in terms of overall audio
quality I've spent very little time with
them so far but the bass is more than
satisfactory these are up there with
some of the best gaming headsets that
I've used in the past maybe not as good
as something that's more like a
dedicated headphone something like a
sennheiser HD 555 but they're definitely
up there with yeah the best gaming
headsets that I've used one thing that's
actually mentioned on the issues
documentation that I didn't even notice
until until now is that they definitely
recommend using it with a headphone amp
sound card and I would definitely back
that up so I tried using it on my on
another audio source already and then
I'm trying it on the test bench right
now as well just to compare and the
volume level that I'm able to achieve on
just regular on board non amped audio
source is not as high as if I was really
listening to music and I really wanted
to turn it up it's not as high as I'd
like to get so I would definitely
recommend guys if you're going to pick
up something like this then pick up an
amp sound card whether you have that
onboard on your motherboard or whether
you get an additional sound card that
has an external power as well as an
amped headphone out port so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and
overview of the Vulcan ANC active
noise-cancelling headset from a soos do
I say this is a very very satisfactory
first attempt for use for a headset and
I'm really looking forward to seeing
what they have coming in the future
