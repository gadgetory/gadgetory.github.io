they actually decided on what I thought
was a really cool way of showing us how
it works we got to follow the entire
production line for the HD 800
headphones so they're top
top-of-the-line top-of-the-line over
your headphones we essentially got our
own like guided tour how it's made
episode so now of course we're going to
start making HD 801 - tech tips edition
headphones Oh cuz we have all that
expertise no definitely yeah we saw how
they they watch so it starts with the
coil being wound by an automated coil
winder machine that's got this heat gun
that lets the that let's the wound coil
kind of stick to itself so it all stays
exactly precisely exactly the way it's
supposed to be and then it comes out on
like a a spool of coiled spools and they
just if it's not exactly perfectly round
they just ditch it ya know there's an
entire bin of just nope round enough
they were ever so slightly off the curve
so no so the finished coils get
delivered to the next station where I
was actually really surprised to see
someone hand gluing coils on two
diaphragms at this stage in the product
I assume something like this would be
automated I assumed the entire process
would be automated but no at almost
every stage there's some amount of hand
based intervention and they were saying
the reason for this is that for certain
tasks it's apparently still more precise
to have someone do it by hand because
there's lots of products they even
showed us some microphones or a
microphone assembly area that was 100%
automated start to finish being
delivered in a master carton of
microphones but the HD 800 s had a lot
of hand assembly and then something I
didn't notice until they pointed it out
was how many of the workers in this area
the factory were female and not
necessarily because females tend to love
playing around with soldering irons more
than other people or whatever else the
case may be but but they were looking
for a particular background
very high skilled in fine motor skills
so they would specifically hire people
that were previously things like
hairdressers or florists things that
required small fine precise motor skills
and attention to detail and attention to
details specifically yeah so with this
next step the chassis for the headphones
which was actually produced elsewhere in
the factory we never got to see raw
materials being turned into HD 800
unfortunately pieces which would have
been super cool so these get the the
coil and the diaphragm actually
installed in them along with the magnet
and then the whole thing is glued in
place and at this point you basically
got a fully assembled transducer that's
ready for the first QC step in the
assembly process so they have to make
sure first of all that it fits within
the appropriate frequency response range
and that it can pair properly with
another transducer so they need to test
all of these things and then find good
pairs so they can both go within the
same set of 800 you have the same sound
signature for each one yeah because you
might have the sort of the acceptable
frequency response curve but there might
be a range of that so they actually will
have like an A and a B and that doesn't
necessarily mean better or worse it just
means they're trying to look for ones
that go together as best as they can now
what was interesting to me was how many
assembled pieces failed which is not
that the fail isn't necessarily a bad
thing though because they're they're
being very tight about their regulations
and they're making sure that if it's not
perfect it's not getting through which
is actually awesome and anything even a
high precision product like like a CPU
processor is going to have a yield rate
and a lot of failures the important
thing is seeing that they're testing
them and junking them at this stage of
their filming here not when they're at
your door yeah which is pretty cool now
it actually wasn't necessarily the
coolest thing about this step in the
process the final step in the assembly
process but it was definitely the first
thing that caught my eye in the back of
the tiny little like four or five square
meter area where by the way every single
HD 800
the world gets built in this exact place
by one of five people they had 19 we
counted them 19 HD 8 hundreds on a rack
ready to go out the door absolutely
freaking beautiful but the coolest thing
about this workstation was probably how
optimized it is yeah you could tell as
the as the work was moving through all
the stages of creating the headphones
that she definitely had this place
optimized just to even where the bins
were placed and the whole thing was made
out of extrusion to the point where you
knew that Sennheiser just made these
custom for the employees and it looked
kind of modular even yeah extremely
modular and that's because they
cardboard prototype all of their
stations for the employees that will be
working there so they get all the
employees that will use that station in
with these cardboard crafted prototypes
to make sure that everything is in
exactly the right spot so that if some
box is a little bit too far out of the
way and in a kind of crappy position you
can move that so it won't make their
arms or if they're working so all these
all these workstations are specifically
built for them now it should be noted
that not every product gets the same
treatment with like every piece being
hand assembled the way the HD 800 does
particularly the very high-end products
especially the ones made in Germany this
is going to be more common but sometimes
you're going to have certain parts of
the product made let's say for example I
believe it's momentum where certain
components are made in the Ireland
facility and then shipped to China for
assembly so depending on the product it
might be actually manufactured in
Germany Ireland the US for some of the
professional grade stuff or in China
it seems very common that they would
make the acoustically important parts in
something like Germany or maybe even
possibly Ireland and then they would do
a lot of the assembly and somewhere like
China what's cool though is they were
saying that regardless of where the
manufacturing facility is they're still
trying to keep things very Sennheiser in
terms of the of the quality of life of
the workers and the regulations and it
you know same thing like prototyping the
workstations to make sure that they
actually are as efficient as possible
and comfortable as possible
so I thought I thought that was really
really incredible and cool next up was
another Q ace
so this time you put the headphones on
kind of an artificial head that will
have a microphone on each side so they
can hear each one of the individual
transducers from the headphones and then
they'll roll it into a soundproof box so
that no sound is going to leak in from
the factory automatically awesome like
an automatic link track we actually
didn't get to see it working
unfortunately they do the QA in batches
so but but we had it explained to us and
it looks pretty baller even if we don't
get to see it in action yeah they were
so careful about this box not having any
outside noise that it was even on
dampeners so if someone was to walk by
really heavily there would be none of
that transferred into the inside of the
box so just making sure that all the
frequency responses here and everything
is perfect yeah so then you
unfortunately they don't include a
printout in the box or anything like
that but what's cool is with the HD 800
you can actually contact Sennheiser and
they will mail you the exact testing
report from your exact serial number
because they manually record them at
this stage in the process which I
thought was pretty darn cool they also
have an artificial mouth on this
artificial head with artificial ears
that is used for aviation headsets and
then they have speakers inside the sound
chamber for testing the noise
cancellation of aforementioned
headsets so very interesting stuff so we
were on our way to product development
and they asked us if we wanted to see
the companion product of the HD 800 the
HD VD 800 so this is an amplifier and I
think the coolest thing about it was has
got to be the testing apparatus we
didn't actually see a ton of the actual
assembly but we saw a little bit of it
but again the really interesting part
was the testing so he hooked up
everything you possibly could all the
things tested multiple volume levels for
all every single possible mode that
there was and tested everything on this
thing so you know it's gonna the whole
thing took about 10 minutes and then it
wasn't until after it passed testing
that it even got a serial number and
then it was polished Paul post twice
plus twice and then finally put away and
then ready to rock then we made our way
upstairs and this was probably one of
the coolest things about the
entire tour we got to visit the anechoic
chamber so this is a two-story chamber
full of noise dampening foam that's got
this that's got this triangular shape
that is designed to pretty much
eliminate wall reflections it was super
weird standing in the room just because
and they only allow four people at a
time because you're actually standing on
mesh yeah because because you're
standing above an entire story of more
noise dampening foam below you so the
rooms mostly mostly used for microphone
testing but what's really cool is not
necessarily the anechoic chamber but
actually a new testing facility that
they're in the process of building which
is going to be an entire auditorium and
stage where they'll not only apparently
actually have concerts but bill use as a
testing ground for their
professional-grade equipment which is
pretty awesome and then I think they're
going to have another chamber in there
so that they can rebuild that one so
they can use that in the future as well
and then eventually they'll have to and
yeah crazy all I know is I want one yeah
I'll be pretty cool so with the factory
out of the way this was this was really
cool we got to actually see a little bit
of the Sennheiser company history I mean
is still actually a family-owned
business which for a company that size
is is pretty unusual but we got to go
and chill in the farmhouse which is at
the very heart of the Sennheiser campus
they just tack on new things every time
they they make some money and they they
need a new facility or equipment so it's
in various states of sophistication
depending on you can see how far along
the company was based on how big the
building is and how modern the building
is yeah it's very cool so we actually
got to go into into the old farmhouse
where they the original seven engineers
started building audio equipment for
other companies right at the end of the
Second World War just to make ends meet
because there they were actually audio
engineers and professors that had worked
in University and that university had
been unfortunately basically flattened
yeah so that needed somewhere to work
and that was a farmhouse and the
Americans came along and put a sign on
the door that said basically we don't
know what you're doing here but
and the sign mysteriously disappeared in
the night and they and they kept working
and I guess I guess any audio files
today are probably glad that they did
definitely so inside there they had some
really cool stuff they had Sennheiser's
first their their patented open
headphones or the 4:14 yeah something
along those lines by today's standards
they look like a joke but at the time
that was that was really amazing they've
got a lot of their earlier microphone
products
I even had stuff for testing
telecommunication cables which was one
of the first things they did for kind of
rebuilding different parts of Germany
just out of necessity because the
Sennheiser had to make some some money
at the time the centerpiece here though
and this was unfortunately it was under
glass we didn't even get a chance to
listen to it but they had an Orpheus oh
man
super nice super nice the most amazing
thing about the manufacturing of the
Orpheus I think is the glass pieces with
thousand holes right a thousand drilled
holes in them I mean if you ever tried
to drill one hole in that it's crazy but
probably gives you some idea how hard it
is to drill a thousand yeah
and then they also had another little
wall of fame inside that they let us
have a look at so they've got Grammys
Academy Awards all kinds of other awards
and then some really cool products in
the case across from there yeah some
stuff that they've never even actually
released because they just couldn't
actually find a market for it but was
super cool I mean seeing all this
history stuff was really cool but then
we actually got an opportunity to sit
down with some of the Sennheiser folks
and talk about what they're doing today
with the consumer products like the
momentum and the urbanite so we'll let
them kind of take it from here and talk
about the the philosophy and and
especially the way that that product
development the product design is being
translated into a message that the more
mainstream public can can relate to a
little bit better yeah we don't see it
as a campaign we see it as we see it
more as a kind of project and the
project is that we would like to keep in
contact with people who drive sound one
step forward as we do and we would we
would stay in contact yeah we would work
on some projects together ingress was a
good example
we are supporting a demain stone with
some stuff she could use for performing
bridges and I don't want to say the
project ends shorter for a campaign it
is a kind of short-term or midterm
activity yeah you produce some banners
you do some advertising stuff and you
have a short-term effect but what we see
is that a long term relationship a long
term impact driven message is more
successful for us and that's reason by
this this project is more kind of
long-term project yeah well of course we
have to bring new stories in from time
to time but it's not a kind of
short-term effect of course we need to
be we need to sell products yeah and
after after running this campaign for
the first six months we see a big lift
in selling products but again this is
more kind of two years activity instead
of doing this for two months or a bit
longer because we started in a position
especially in the US market which is the
biggest market in the world with not the
strong position as we are in middle of
Europe so it's from from the brand
itself not everybody knows it it's more
kind of a whose Sennheiser so we need
something I would call a bridge to a
target root maybe not interested in the
sound device itself but in terms of the
image headphones especially the big ones
like we produce now with the urban I'd
became more a fashion item device
something you want to express your
personality and there people are looking
more what it means to them in terms of
stylish component so the idea was to
turn the perspective not talk about the
device itself about the sound the style
made but talking about the end user so
from people looking to simply sound
devices express a different kind of
style of music and this was always the
Sennheiser approach to be some kind of
new
child was a Sennheiser sound I would say
it'd be very clear crisp could display
nearly every kind of music from bebop
chairs to hard rock or whatever we found
on story
studies that really the audience prefer
this kind of devices not display the
whole area the whole range of the music
portfolio but have an expressionist in a
very specific kind of music style and
this is our gift I would say our present
to them and to really recognize that
they're the listen experience changed in
the last five years I would say so when
we were done the interviews one of the
most disappointing things of the day her
moments was when we arrived we were told
that axel Grell the original designer of
the HD 800 headphones was not able to be
there because he was sick after the
interviews we found out he was able to
make it he's still sick we couldn't
shake his hand or anything which I
really wanted to do but even cooler than
that probably he gave us a little mini
lesson yeah the probably one of the
coolest lessons I've ever sat in on
there was there was essentially two
students Linus and myself and he went up
there on on this on this grid paper
essentially with a marker and just
showed us how audio drivers work
why bigger is good for some things but
actually smaller is better for other
things and the and the delicate
balancing act that you have to go
through to make a headphone product and
then how they overcame the traditional
design with the HD 800 and and made it
perform the way that it does it was it
was incredibly cool and I think he might
have felt a little bit awkward at the
end when I asked him to sign the lesson
sheet because I planned to roll it up
and take it away with me but because
we're quite literally gonna frame it and
put it up in the office yeah so so that
was incredibly cool just to get to get
to meet someone with who's had that kind
of an impact on on headphones it's it's
it's just it's interesting being in the
presence of someone that obviously knows
that much about their specialty and it's
just whenever you meet someone like
that is like okay I need to pay
attention he probably lost more brain
cells sneezing from being sick that know
more about audio equipment and I'll ever
like just just incredible so speaking of
incredible our our trip to Sennheiser
was an incredible ride I hope you guys
enjoyed coming along for it give this
