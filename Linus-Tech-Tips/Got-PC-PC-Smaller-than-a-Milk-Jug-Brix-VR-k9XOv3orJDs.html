already know that we've been having a
lot of fun smashing exceptional gaming
machines into incredibly small form
factors and if you've been subscribed to
our channel for a longer period then
you'll know that we've also been
covering tiny non-gaming ultra compact
pcs for years well then it was only a
matter of time before our product would
come along that blurred the lines
between these two categories you can
call it ultra form factor you can call
it small compact gigabyte calls it
bricks VR gbbn i 7h g 6 - 10 6 0 but I
call it the Kleenex box of annihilation
or the couple but will it bring you
tears of joy or tears of suck well it'd
be a crying shame if we didn't find out
Roswell's 25u adjustable open frame rack
is a wide range easy to install server
rack or cabinet for small businesses
home offices and studios check it out
now at the link below so to put this
product in perspective if the kabob were
the size of the outer box it came in it
would still be small enough to make it
into our recent small form-factor case
roundup which you can check out here but
it gets far better than that gigabyte
has done some incredible engineering
work here and managed to fit a
formidable gaming rig into a volume of
only 2 point 6 liters that is a mere
third of the size of the smallest case
in that roundup I mean seriously if this
machine were filled with chocolate milk
I could literally drink it in one
sitting
which I will begin to do now now the
chassis of our top tier config is a
hundred and ten millimeters square by
220 millimeters tall with a dark
anodized aluminum finish that
subjectively looks a lot more premium
than its lower tiered kitchenaid style
brethren but still fall short of looking
as good as it could you know it pains me
to say this but in this case while I
have to give them credit for not going
full gamer I think it might have looked
a little better especially in a home
theater without the orange flipping it
around we find a healthy helping of Io 3
USB 3 5 gig ports and 2 USB 3 10 gig
ports one type a and one type C and it's
got more stuff that we like Gigabit
Ethernet with audio out and in and some
we don't external antennas come on guys
those are so 1997 now here's one of the
big product differentiators it's got two
HDMI 2.0 ports and two display port mini
port
that is where the VR sticker on the box
comes from this thing has a VR grade
dedicated graphics card gigabyte made
opening the Kabul really easy this is a
key consideration for something that
will be sold as a bare-bones machine for
you to choose your own OS storage and
memory just remember though guys that it
won't be entirely plug-and-play so
factor these items and any other
accessories into your budget just four
screws hold the outer chassis on then a
few more conveniently marked little guys
hold together what we're calling the
music box for nerds oh oh I just broke a
small thing but it's okay it's actually
a pretty beefy cooler for like a 1062
fully custom GPUs there's the dual mini
display ports there's the dual HTM eyes
GPUs down there looks like his RAM on
the back no but we've got power delivery
on the back here and then we've got
actually can't oh okay
so they've got memory under a heat pipe
over here yeah there it is so memory is
here in here that everything about this
thing is custom down to the printing on
the vrm modules expandability is like
really compact in here so you've got one
m dot two then you've got another that
runs either PCI Express or SATA m2 you
got your two sodium's and then so you
can actually oh this is cool so you can
actually install a two and a half inch
drive here okay then so it's a
pint-sized PC with a gtx 1060 in it but
can it actually deliver butter smooth
frame rates and games without melting
well from our favorite games to
synthetics like Unigine superpositions
performance tests and even its VR
benchmarks this branding is officially
living up to its promise and the Cibola
was quiet across all of our tests even
when slogging through the VR test on the
very demanding future setting with the
GPU hanging around the mid-80s CPU
thermals though are a bit of a different
story
I 264 s FPU stress test turned the Kapua
into a bit of a flaming hamster wheel we
had to double check our sound meter yep
that's right 70 plus decibels and even
then the CPU was in the high 90s
throttling down by as much as 25% we
were thinking maybe it was due to our
slightly unfair synthetic workload so we
fired up Adobe Premiere and encoded a
video in 4k with well pretty much the
same results this was a bad idea but how
big of a deal all this is really depends
on your expectations this isn't a full
fat workstation but gigabyte never said
it was and aside from their claim that
it has similar upgradability to a
full-size pc Thunderbolt 3 would
probably help a lot for me to say that
that's fair the kapu pretty much lives
up to all of the points listed on the
product page it's a great fit for VR in
your living room or home theater and
thanks to its size you can easily take
it with you on the go I'm giving this
thing up to drugs up we need slightly
smaller computers before I can try a
repeat of this do you love anime well if
