5670 from XFX the biggest difference
between this and the next one up to 5750
is that it has fewer stream processors
our LPS and texture units it also has a
slightly lower memory clock in terms of
in relation to the other card and I
can't find my knife where is my knife
thank you and it also mmm-hmm has a
faster clock speed so basically what
this card is is it's supposed to it sit
position it's positioned only about ten
to ten to 20 dollars cheaper than the
5750 depending on how much memory this
one in particular is a 512 Meg card
whereas most of the 57 50s out there are
one gig so that's gonna make a
difference to the price right off the
bat and then there's also the fact that
it's damaged and it was clocked a little
bit higher so it's a value card that's
not meant to pump out the same kind of
detail levels as these higher-end
DirectX 11 cards but it does bring most
of the same features to the table so it
has support for I Finity it has support
for DirectX 11 under Windows 7 so you've
got that feature set it has 7.1 audio
out over HDMI but not the raw gaming
speed so it's more for people who just
want to use their card casually for
gaming once in a while so let's see what
we've got inside here first we have a
quick install guide and step 1 prepare
your computer step 2 remove your
existing graphics card pathetic boopadoo
okay thank you and then we have a a long
installation guide okay thank you XFX
for providing that for your valued
customers okay then you have an ATI
graphics card CD sleeve don't use this
download the latest drivers off ATI comm
then we have this I love it comes with
all XFX cards as far as I can tell oh
they've updated it too it doesn't have
the dog on it anymore
now it has like a gun do not disturb I'm
gaming door hanger card and this is
convenient because it also has a place
on the back that shows you how to
contact their support and tells you
where to write your username and
password for your login when you
register your card and it also has I
mean this is cool look at this it has I
shouldn't I shouldn't show you this but
the serial number for the card as well
as the personal activation code
to register your warranty I mean that is
great because most of the time they just
have it on the back of the card you're
gonna rip open your case in order to
even find it this is empty look at that
there's nothing under this side it was
all over here how about that okay oh wow
this looks kind of funny actually so we
got this big box did it did it did it to
do this small card okay so in here we
will find the 5670 and feel like I'm
feel like I'm missing it I guess with a
value card like this I mean they've got
like they still got all the expensive
like nice packaging and everything but
not much in terms of accessories with a
card like this I guess that's to be
expected so let's pull it out you've got
your standard matte black XFX PCB it
seems like an insignificant detail but I
love it I personally love the matte
black PCB it looks really nice when it's
all installed in your computer doesn't
show dust as much I realize that these
are aesthetic quibbles and those people
don't care but it does matter to me
you've got a PCI Express 16x connector
along the bottom please note the absence
of crossfire connectors that does not
mean that it doesn't support crossfire
it supports crossfire just fine but this
isn't a super high bandwidth card you
don't need it to communicate directly
with the card it community can
communicate just fine over the PCI
Express bus so they don't worry about
that too too much on the back we've got
support for DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
something you should be aware of is that
if you want to use all three you've got
to use all three you can't actually use
a DisplayPort to DVI adapter you can use
an HDMI to DVI adapter and a DVI monitor
and a DisplayPort monitor but unless
you're using an active and that means it
costs like 100 bucks plus DisplayPort to
DVI adapter it will not work okay so
along to the other side you've got a
pretty a pretty whoopsie looking
heatsink but I mean this is not a very
high powered part it doesn't output a
lot of heat you don't have to worry too
much about it you've got a little
heatsink here that cools the memory
chips which are located just down there
I don't think you're gonna be able to
see that you've got your power connector
and you have your power delivery you'll
notice the absence I mean it's hard to
actually unbox something like this
because normally I'll be pointing out
all the stuff but I'm pointing out
instead what is not here you'll notice
the apps
of a PCI Express six pin connector so
you do not need to plug this in
separately to your power supply that is
again because it is a very power
efficient card it doesn't require a
whole lot from your power supply and I
think that pretty much covers everything
I wanted to say about this car thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the 5670
512 Meg from XFX</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
