this series we could have done a lot
better with our first GPU mining
computer but believe it or not we knew
that theoretically 1080 eyes are the
most profitable but we have to ignore
cost to buy and so today is all about
rectifying our stupidity that is in part
2 of this series which is now we're
gonna show you guys how you can mine
cryptocurrency at home properly and
we're gonna build what we call the
ultimate 13 GPU price to performance
mining rig kind of started out with that
announcer and then it went away and
we're gonna do that after we tell you

part selection might not be thrilling
but it's the single most crucial part of
building a mining rig now we touched on
this a little bit in our last video but
one of the key factors in a
well-designed miner is what's called the
ROI time that is how long it will take
the hardware to pay for itself and start
generating a profit
now our first machine would have taken
what five years five five years but a
well-designed miner should take closer
to four to six months now let's
introduce the big star of this video the
motherboard most people will just jump
on whatever is the cheapest five to
seven slot board available at the time
but a Seuss's b250 mining expert if you
can find it in stock lets us spend a
little bit more on the board and the
reason that we can afford this is that
we can save on system components that
don't affect mining speed like CPUs RAM
and SSDs because even if we don't fill
it up with the P 106 or P 104 Mining
cards that are apparently required for
it to reach its full 19 GPU potential 13
graphics cards is still about twice as
many as a normal board now for our CPU
choice so this is gonna be a little
different from normal Linus tech tips
we're looking for cheep-cheep-cheep
so coffee lake is out of the question
what Jake's installing here is a last
gen kV Lake where we'll find some better
options like the Intel Celeron G 39:30
which for around 35 bucks us with the
heatsink included is basically steel now
as for RAM right now similar to the CPU
basically we'd recommend whatever is the
cheapest compatible memory that you can
find from a reputable brand at the time
of filming this ended up being some
bare-bones 20 400 megahertz EDR for from
crucial for just under 50 bucks okay now
we're getting into the tough stuff it's
no longer as simple as just buy the
cheapest one you can find
picking the absolute best GPU for mining
would pretty much require a crystal ball
but that doesn't mean we can't make some
educated guesses
so for users who are more limited by
space making the most of every PCIe slot
by filling their rigs with 1080 T eyes
for maximum raw power might make sense
but based on the numbers today the ROI
time for that approach compared to our
choice is much longer so right now one
of the best AMD cards and reliability is
a factor here - is the rx 574 gig after
flashing a mining friendly BIOS and yes
we know Vega is insane at Madero mining
but it has some other issues so the
water-cooled Vegas 64 in our mining test
server would regularly switch HPCC off
for no apparent reason
cutting the hash rate of the card to
about the same as a bio slashed rx 580
so it's not worth it to us for the extra
cost and hassle at this time even if we
could find any of them in stock now on
the Nvidia side of things gtx 10 60s and
10 70s yields a similar ROI time to each
other
but most miners these days are often for
the 1060 due to its lower upfront costs
and better relative resale value now
they have their issues Nvidia cards with
sub-optimal Ram yes graphics cards can
use memory from different manufacturers
and you cannot predict what you'll get
in the box drop a lot more performance
than AMD cards with bad RAM do but one
nice thing about Nvidia cards is that
they don't need a BIOS flash in order to
hash at their peak so then we ended up
with a balanced approach here 8 RX 5 70s
which is a total lie because actually
one of them's a four seventy three of
them are actually five ATS
check out these five ATS from that a su
sent over this things are ridiculous
thanks Bros and then we've got two of
what are some pretty special passively
cooled P 104 Mining cards that are the
equivalent to a gaming GTX 270 about
mining cards basically a mining card is
a less expensive version of its gaming
cousin that comes with beefier power
delivery and in some cases claims of
better efficiency which believe it or
not we were able to observe with these
sample cards from Manley so all of that
is good stuff the problem though is that
they have much shorter warranties and
they have no display outputs which can
potentially have a negative impact on
their resale value if that's part of
your model for making back your money
okay so it's assembly time these these
mining cards actually just go in with
with zip ties here because they don't
have PC high brackets so it's just a
little you know something like that but
that is far from our biggest potential
problem now actually yeah thank you you
guys might have noticed before that the
b250 mining expert has PCI Express 1x
slots all over the place definitely way
too small to fit a full-sized graphics
card so what gives Ben well it's
designed around the use of risers so
these 5 to $10 kits come with they come
with a 16 X slot on a little PCB they
come with a power adapter and they come
with a USB cable that plugs in to see
that another little PCB that goes right
in to check this out
goes right into our 1x slot a little
something like that now there are a ton
of models of these things on the market
but the go-to currently is the V er 0 0
6 C or version 6 C
and this was recommended to us by
longtime cryptocurrency expert Marshall
long that's a gbtc on twitter now one
tip when powering these guys is to use
as few adapters as possible than
plugging them in so ours are run off
SATA so we're going to be using two of
these adapters per se to harness coming
out of our power supply on the subject
of power this is one of the biggest
concerns for any minor and choosing the
right power supplies yes
plural potentially for your system can
be tricky now for small-scale miners
changes in efficiency like going from an
80 plus gold power supply to an 80 plus
titanium model probably won't
significantly impact your ROI time so
most folks go for a relatively
inexpensive 800 to 1200 watt unit from a
trusted brand leaving some Headroom for
more cards if they plan on expanding now
one of the best options for a rig like
ours would actually be an adapted server
power supply that runs 200 volts or more
from a company like parallel miner but
using one of these relies on having 200
volt power which isn't common in North
America and relies on finding anything
in stock which was an issue so we opted
instead for three 850 ish watt units on
most boards you would actually need a
jumper like this one to run multiple
power supplies but it's pretty cool Asus
actually thought of that and the b250
mining expert has three ATX connectors
next order of business then is finding a
place to put all this stuff so deku over
here being the DIY type he's actually
whipped up a couple of different styles
of frames to show you guys and we're
gonna include the dimensions in the
video description if you're interested
this first one was made out of recycled
2 by 4s that he found at work and some
drywall screws that he found at work on
the floor so it has the advantage of
being really really cheap but it should
be noted that we do not recommend having
wood anywhere near a hot mining machine
and we think the additional cost of this
metal frame made from one by one
aluminum from the local hardware store
is worth the better space efficiency and
the lower weight though again you would
want to improvise a non wooden support
system for your graphics cards for the
13 GPU rig though rather than building a
gigantic chassis we opted to demo
another popular mounting strategy which
is building your minor right into a
shelving unit now this isn't great if
you have to move it around but it is
pretty darn cost-effective because even
if you are using racks you're going to
want shelves to put them on anyhow okay
so everything's together we booted up
windows we flashed a few of our GPUs
with some customized bios's and we have
some mining software ready to go so
we're currently using a management
utility called awesome miner and without
going into too much detail that's
probably a subject for another video it
basically allows you to control up to
5,000 machines in a single instance and
it can Auto profits which notify you if
your rigs are having issues help
organize your miners into groups and a
lot more so with it all set up we're
mining Manero with the cast XMR minor on
the AMD GPUs and then Z cache with the
DS TN minor on the to Nvidia cards and
without much tuning the AMD cards are
running an average of 7.3 kilo hashes
per second and kryptonite and the Nvidia
cards are at around one pilla hash per
second in equi hash this all equates to
a current average of about 900 US
dollars per month in revenue before we
pay for power so at about 10 US cents
per kilowatt-hour this config with
current profitability is sitting pretty
at about a five-month ROI time that's
about a percent of our original rigs
estimated ROI time which is pretty damn
good so guys stay tuned then for part
three of mining adventure where we look
at the pros and cons of asic miners
because GPUs are not the only way to
tackle this
speaking of tackling things fresh books
is the way that freelancers and small
business owners can tackle their
accounting problems it's the simple way
to be more productive more organized and
get paid faster create and send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds set up online payments
with just a couple of clicks and get
paid up to four days faster see when
your client has seen your invoice to put
