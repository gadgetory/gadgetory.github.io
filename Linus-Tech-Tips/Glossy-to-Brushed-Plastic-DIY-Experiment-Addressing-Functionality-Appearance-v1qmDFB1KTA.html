my gears about computer components it is
their apparent obsession that their
creators have with putting glossy
plastic on all the places it really
should not be I don't know if how we
still have this problem I'll admit it
hasn't really been as bad lately but it
does still happen anyways in a fit of
rage after marketing up yet another
glossy plastic surface I ran to the
store and assembled the tools I thought
I may need to transform glossy plastic
surface into a beautiful brushed
finished
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click now to learn more so how do we
make this transformation from a piece of
glossy plastic to a nice brushed finish
I chose to tackle this in the best way I
know how there's scientific testing I
assemble the necessary tools sandpaper
in 320 400 800 and 1000 grit I ideally
want to feature 600 grit as well but I
wasn't able to source any locally I also
grabbed grade 0 and grade 3 steel wool
and three rough 3m stripping pads the
kind you'd use to scrub hard to clean
things or remove some type of thing off
on a surface they were labeled as heavy
contour surface stripping and final most
of these were used individually but the
sandpaper will be used in succession
starting at 320 grit and ending at 1,000
once I had these tools at my side I
found some surfaces with a glossy finish
namely an original Nintendo Wii the back
of an Asus monitor and an old Seagate go
flex satellite but Luke you may be
saying why ruin a perfectly good we
monitor and go flex drive for the sake
of your silly experiment of course I
would not be doing this with my own way
and to do this test the way that we're
using is actually Linus's you may have
noticed its appearance to be fairly
nasty with a bunch of marks and old
sticky areas all over it only a man with
true disregard for his gaming systems
would leave them in this state plus he's
out of the country right now so he
probably won't mind anyways let's see it
- do you mind if we easier.we to test
like scratching glossy plastic off
things no answer means no problem when
it comes to the monitor well we decided
to use this monitor because the glossy
portion is actually on the back as well
meaning that we could experiment with it
and if it came out looking absolutely
terrible I could just use it normally
and never have to see my massive failure
ever again and if it worked well I could
transition over to the front of the
monitor and change that side over to
brush plastic finished as well with the
material that I found to leave the most
appealing faux brush plastic finish and
seagate drive well I'm sure it was
beautiful at one time but nowadays it is
pretty faded a bit scratched and covered
in fingerprints this device will be the
last one that I use and I'll use my
favorite method on it to see what it can
accomplish on something like this
so with testing surfaces in place I tape
taped off sections for each material so
that I could compare the efficiency of
each in a well-organized fashion this
may result in a weird look once I pull
the tape off and will ultimately kind of
ruin the aesthetic of these devices at
least at first but this is the video for
you guys and I'm sure Linus won't mind
so here we go I started with the we I
pour shinned off one side of it for the
three levels of 3m pad and the other
side for the two varieties of steel wool
as well as the sandpaper combination to
my eye it seems like the guru zero grade
still won't provided the best finish on
the white surface of the Wii but it was
actually fairly hard to tell as the
white brushed plastic doesn't really
have the same shine we're accustomed to
seeing on black brush plastic in the end
they all seemed pretty similar to be
completely honest on white brush plastic
so I think you'd be pretty happy with
any of these solutions my favorite part
of this procedure on the Wii was less
giving it a brushed look and more just
removing the shine and fingerprint
potential the monitor was where we
separated the men from the boys so to
speak the 3m contour stripping pad
provided what I think was actually a
pretty amazing brush look finished for a
DIY solutions like this if I hadn't been
doing this for the test I may have
actually been convinced that it came
brush from the factory without looking
all that closely the runner-up was
actually a tie between the grade zero
steel wool and the 3m final pad but it
must be noted that it was much more
difficult to get a consistent finish
with the steel wool as a material was
much more malleable in hand and the pads
provided a nice solid base to push
against and seemed to provide the most
even finish overall without the need to
do as many touch-ups which can result in
it looking not as nice as more often
than not touch up or require the need of
even more touch-ups
since the contour surface stripping pad
perform the best on the monitor I
decided to use that for the Seagate
drive as well
it actually provided a pretty amazing
result to be honest and I think that the
new finish looks pretty darn sharp
compared to the old glossy version I do
think it was a little harder than it
could have been due to the slowly
stripping away the from the white logo
but in the end it was totally worth it
at first I tried covering that logo with
tape to protect it but in the end this
just looked kind of weird and it wasn't
worth it so I took it off and made it
look the same as the rest so overall I
think this experiment was a success
well it isn't perfect I was actually
able to replicate the look of brush
plastic fairly well especially with
these 3m pads I would definitely
recommend giving these a shot if you're
planning on running this experiment for
yourself or if you plan on converting
some of your glossy plastic to a brush
finish on your own
speaking of improving things I'm excited
to announce a drop on mass drop today
that you will certainly not see very
often they're providing a build-your-own
battle station setup featuring three LG
24m c57 hqp monitors which are 1080p IPS
displays an Ergo tech freedom arm a
triple monitor stand that has work
written all over it get it cuz a freedom
or whatever anyways if you want to beef
up your displays then set up a triple
monitor battle station this is going to
be one of the more affordable ways to do
so thanks to mass drops grouped by model
you can check out this drop and many
others in the link in the description
