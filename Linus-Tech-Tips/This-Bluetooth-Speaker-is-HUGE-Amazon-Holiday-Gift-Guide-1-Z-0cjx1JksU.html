our pics from their sweet Gift Guide
it's the path of least resistance for
awesome gift ideas and everything on it
is eligible for two-day shipping if
you're a Prime member or if you're an
Amazon Prime trial member so today we
were focused on audio and accessories so
guys forget about silent night this
Christmas it's gonna be all about
turning it out
first up is the Sonos one see what we
did there the smart speaker for music
lovers not only does it sound great but
this compact little dynamo is wall or
stand mountable fits just about anywhere
its humidity resistant even and can be
used in multi speaker setups so you can
use it to add surround to your stereo
living room setup but what makes the
Sonos one really special is its
integration with a certain virtual
assistant whose name we won't sail out
because we don't want to accidentally
lower your blinds so thanks to that
functionality you can want completely
control your music and volume using your
voice thanks to the speaker's 6
microphone array and to enjoy all the
functions of your Amazon echo through a
high quality speaker nice but hold on a
second Linus aside from the a le XA
integration everything about the one is
exactly the same as that other so no
speaker the play one so is that
discontinued now or what not at all
where some see the play ones lack of
voice control is a deficiency others see
it as a feature so if you're the type of
person who doesn't want an
internet-connected microphone a few feet
from the throne you can still control
the play one with the buttons on the
device or remotely with the companion
app google play music on android even
allows you to cast to your play one with
just a couple of taps so that sounds
good but what if you need the speaker
you can take with you on the go check
out the UE boom - Bluetooth speaker it's
wireless it sounds great and it's
versatile form factor lets you take it
anywhere I like to listen to mine in the
kitchen and believe it or not that's
totally cool because this sucker is
crazy durable it's ipx7 rated so if you
get it wet or muddy you can simply rinse
it off with warm soapy water or even
submerge it for up to half an hour
though you don't have to if you're
anything like me you might prefer to
just leave it dirty
but Linus what if 90 decibels as loud as
a motorcycle from 25 feet just isn't
loud enough for me well then we've got
you covered you need the Sony
tkx b60 the XB stands for extra base it
is 10 to 15 decibels louder than the
boom - and more importantly it's
performance is a lot better at those
loud volumes if the boom - is for
blaring tunes on a bike ride along the
seawall
then the xB 60 is for holding an EDM
party anywhere as advertised on the
website and as corporate and out of
touch as that marketing speak sounds
this thing is a lot lighter than it
looks and boasts up to 15 hours of
battery life provided that the volume
isn't completely cranked and the lights
are off and you heard me guys lights the
real reason we put this on our list is
the RGB lighting that actually syncs
with the music and can be controlled by
a companion app making the xB 60 great
for everyone from street performers and
buskers to Bush party hooligans bringing
us finally to a pair of speakers that
only one person can listen to at a time
I guess these are typically referred to
as headphones meet the HD 4.4 TBT
Wireless from Sennheiser these things
are great you get quality Sennheiser
sound for a price that isn't crazy and
they're totally ready to go they fold up
nicely and the battery does actually
last around the 25 hour mark as
advertised then when they do die you can
plug in an aux cable and rock out the
old-fashioned way they're really light
and the leather at ear pads are super
comfortable provided that you don't wear
glasses or have ginormous ears they also
have an integrated microphone so you can
take phone calls with all the controls
on the right side so you can answer hang
up and put people on hold and of course
these same buttons let you control the
tunes when you're listening to music
they're all around solid performers that
