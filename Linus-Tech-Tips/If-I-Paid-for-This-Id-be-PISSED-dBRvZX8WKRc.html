friend's house and out of politeness you
wolf down the butternut-squash giving
your compliments to the chef
and then to your utter dismay they plop
another giant helping on your plate well
today's subject is a little bit like
that because we still can't quite figure
out who asked for some of the features
of the phone we're reviewing today the
red hydrogen one but you know what you
guys were asking for I'm sure this
sponsor this video is brought to you by
story blocks video they offer
studio-quality stock video clips for our
fraction of the cost
check them out today at the link in the
video description
our titanium version of the hydrogen one
arrived in a nondescript black box with
a letter from Redd explaining why we
didn't actually get the titanium version
that we ordered looks like they're gonna
send it later but as a way of saying
sorry we actually get to keep the
aluminum one that they shipped early
well I mean I think early is probably
less accurate than saying less horribly
late but still two phones for the price
of one overpriced one is pretty good as
apologies go and I've got to give some
kudos here for a company that doesn't
always do a great job of included
accessories throwing in a fast charger
was a nice touch now after about a week
of shared use between me and Brandon
there are some things about the hydrogen
one that stand out the build quality is
exceptional
with the phone being made of mostly
metal with these scalloped ridges on the
side that actually helped with grip more
than I anticipated another unexpected
benefit of the scallops is that they
make it really easy to find the power
button which doubles as the fingerprint
reader this was a problem that I noticed
with the razor phone too when I was
using it recently that ruggedness does
come with some trade-offs though this is
one heavy phone like to give you guys
some context compared to the samsung
note 9 the note 9 is gigantic
the hydrogen one is point one six pounds
more and you can feel every gram of it
to the point where daily use especially
with small hands like mine did get
tiring at times
continuing with the physical tour we get
to front selfie cameras to rear cameras
much more about those in a moment
stereo front-facing speakers a headphone
jack a toolless SIM tray the holographic
q HD display and the type-c connector at
the bottom now before we get to the two
big features of this phone the display
in the cameras I want to take a minute
to talk about the speakers on Red's
website they say sound you didn't think
to ask for and I think this was an
unintentionally apt way to describe it
because if I had ever overheard someone
asking for this weird 3d audio
technology and their smartphone I would
have told them that frankly
that's a pretty silly idea and Red's
implementation has done nothing to
change my mind with 3d audio enabled you
are supposed to have this expansive
spatial immersive experience but in my
opinion it just sounds like a cheap eq
preset and going around the office and
having others try it both with and
without headphones every single person
preferred the unaltered version and a
couple people actually shared my
disappointment with the maximum volume
of this thing considering how much of
the phone is taken up by speaker grilles
let's move on then to one of the
weirdest features to hit a smartphone in
a long time the qHD holographic display
going back again to Red's literature we
once again find bold claims and once
again find ourselves disappointed I mean
the 3d effect is cool like when the
phone first boots up you're greeted with
a stereoscopic 3d graphic that kind of
pops off the screen and shows off what
the display can do and red built what
they're calling hydrogen Network which
is supposed to be a hub for content that
takes advantage of the display but the
demos themselves are mostly unimpressive
and gimmicky feeling due to the fact
that it feels like there is a
significant drop in resolution when
you're playing back with the 4 V display
on the bottom line is that for media
consumption the holographic effect is
cool but only for about five minutes and
the story doesn't change for gaming on
any of the whopping three games that are
available in lay aloft none of this vote
would be a huge problem if it wasn't for
the glaring issues that exist while
consuming normal content compared to
other flagship smartphone displays the
color accuracy and contrast of the
hydrogen one is just well I don't know
how else to say this it's not even close
which is an even bigger problem when you
consider Reds pedigree as a content
creator company you basically can't do
any meaningful photo editing on this
phone which is becoming a more and more
common use case bringing us perfectly
then to the elephant
or I wouldn't be a dragon or something
more ferocious in the room the cameras
red is of course first and foremost a
digital cinema company so how has that
translated to its smartphone the answer
is it's complicated
the $1,300 price tag on even the
aluminum version of the hydrogen one
means that we have no choice but to
compare it to the best of the best and
Red's lack of experience here
really shows it's not bad across the
board or anything like that but it's
disappointing it leaves me wishing that
red had pushed to be just a little bit
better look at this shot now the pixel 3
came out with the closest shot to my eye
with the note 9 going a little bit too
far and over exposing the building and
the iPhone 10's my opinion leveling out
the entire exposure in each part of the
image too much to the point where
everything looks bright and at the same
time making the whole image lack any
realistic depth now the hydrogen
actually did a good job with the dynamic
range and if we look closer the detail
captured is actually quite good maybe
even better than the note 9 but the
images from this phone they lack color
and they feel flat honestly it feels
kind of like the approach that cinema
cameras take when recording video Flattr
recording allows the editor more
flexibility in post-production in terms
of color and it allows cameras the
ability to capture a much wider dynamic
range versus if they just tried to grab
something that's closer to real life and
record it straight to the camera and
this characteristic is where my
conflicted feelings about the hydrogen
one begin the hydrogen photos
consistently came out duller and flatter
than any of the other phones and you
might think well I like editing my
photos and a flatter image is a good
starting point for a stylized edit but
these are JPEGs not Raw's so there's
less flexibility in post and if you look
closely the hydrogen one's dynamic range
is not as good as the iPhones or the
pixel freeze which means that even with
the theoretically helpful flat look
approach red is still having trouble
matching the performance of the other
flagships so it's the camera not the
screen or the speakers or the weight or
the price where the hydrogen one finally
really falls apart for me again it's not
terrible
this portrait mode shot is being lit by
a neon sign which is a very challenging
scenario and the hydrogen one managed
fairly convincing and natural-looking
bokeh compared to the pixel three with
the iPhone and the note both
face-planting with various levels of
spectacularity but as we look through
this bunch of photos what we find is
that these golden scenarios are few and
far between and overall the images
captured by the hydrogen one tend to
lack life which means more busy work in
Lightroom for an end image that in many
cases won't be better or even as good
and the holographic images are not
enough to save it selfies feel like
you're taking a photo for like a rare
version of a trading card and the rear
camera is actually kind of nauseating to
shoot with because the hydrogen attempts
to convey the effect in the live preview
which basically just makes it harder to
tell if your photos in focus it's a
gimmick and I suspect a second
generation phone if they do one won't
include it so in conclusion the red
hydrogen one is an interesting idea
paired with flagship hardware from two
years ago and under developed software
that needs a lot of maturing before red
will be able to take on the true
flagship competitors if the camera was
amazing we might be singing a different
tune especially in light of the upcoming
accessories and the integration with
other red products and we use them every
day including this shoe this shoe right
now shot on red but as it is it's just
not enough and you shouldn't buy this
film unless you're like a massive red
fanboy and you basically just want it as
like a collector's piece I mean I'll
probably hold on to it for that
