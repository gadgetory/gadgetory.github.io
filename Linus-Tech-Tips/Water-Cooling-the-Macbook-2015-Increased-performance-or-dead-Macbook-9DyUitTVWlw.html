but for those of you who don't a Polly
let x if they deem it necessary from a
form factor or design perspective
actually design their products to
thermal throttle that is to say not run
at full speed under intensive loads we
observe this with the iMac retina 5k and
this is a fairly well known
characteristic of the MacBook 2015
retina which I have here in front of me
of course our HX 1200 i power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet performance and corsair link
digital advanced monitoring and control
click now to learn more it actually
features no active cooling fans so when
we start up a stress test you can
actually see is what happens is the CPU
goes to 2 gigahertz so that is full on
turbo mode for 2 cores 4 threads CPU
temperatures ramped up very dramatically
so we're all the way at 74 degrees now
and we're going to continue rising boom
80 degrees on that CPU within a matter
of seconds and then what you're gonna
see is within a couple moments here this
baby's gonna go ahead and crank all the
way back down to its stock speed of
about 1 gigahertz and the temperatures
are gonna come back down to match so
there she goes we're seeing a little bit
of thermal throttling detected just a
little spike there 4% now we're at 95
degrees on the hottest core 21% thermal
throttling ok there we go so that's the
behavior that we are looking for after a
short while she'll throttle down to
about 1.1 gigahertz and then she's gonna
go a little bit lower down to about 1
gigahertz and the throttling disappears
so you can see we're no longer
throttling and temperatures drop
dramatically but next let's have a look
at a real world load since the I 264
stress test is not exactly
representative of a well real world use
case scenario okay so now we're running
Cinebench and here we saw some really
interesting behavior so we were able to
observe that same two gigahertz turbo at
the beginning of our run here if you
check this out which then slowed down to
as low as 800 to 900 megahertz by the
end of the run and then what was
interesting after that is that a
subsequent run so a second run actually
stayed at 800 to 900 megahertz the whole
time
and gave us a lower overall score which
led me to believe that if we were to
cool down the MacBook 2015 retina maybe
through water cooling means we could
actually get better performance out of
it let's find out so the first thing we
want to establish here is a baseline for
our worst case scenario temperatures for
the device we can see that the CPU is
somewhere towards the back center
because that's where it is actually
hottest somewhere in this territory but
since we're not going to be able to
water cool the top of it we're more
concerned about knowing whether it is on
the bottom or the top and it looks like
it's right about here so we've come up
with a solution
maximum 41 point one degrees it's a good
baseline we've come up with a solution
that will allow us to water cool
the MacBook are we doing it properly is
this something I would recommend
no if you guys are afraid to cringe
maybe the time to tune out is now but if
you want to see us find out if improving
the thermal performance of the new
MacBook 2015 will help it's also
performance performance then stay tuned
seconds all right so we're gonna be
using kneaded eraser oh let's hope that
yep that seems to be working we're gonna
be using kneaded eraser to plug up all
the ports that we don't want to damage
here is this a good long-term solution
the answer is no we are not planning to
run the MacBook water-cooled for a very
extended period of time
just enough to run benchmarks now my
camera operator pointed out that the
MacBook 2015 has no fans and I kind of
went yes that is a good observation but
more importantly the fact that it has no
fans is what's going to allow us to
liquid cool it at all because most
laptops and here I have a demonstrate
I can show you guys most laptops would
have some kind of an intake where
airflow comes in and then it cools a
heating element like a heatsink inside
but because the MacBook 2015 retina only
has passive cooling from its chassis by
liquid cooling the bottom of it we
should be able to cool effectively the
internals of the device as well so for
the hinge at the back I mean really a
silicone or something would have been a
much better solution for this I know
this is not ideal for the hinge at the
back we're just gonna make a snake out
of our kneaded eraser and we're gonna
kind of jam it in there
and hope that the water doesn't doesn't
get around it or anything I mean we're
not gonna be fully submerging the
notebook or anything like that I just
want to give it the best possible chance
of survival that it can have given what
we're doing to it so I've had a bit of a
bit of trouble with the hinge here I
need to make sure I hold the MacBook
still while not disrupting any of my
other kneaded eraser and see if I can
get that pretty much sealed here okay so
I think that's good now I don't want the
hinge to move at all Oh which kind of
means we're stuck with it in that
position so now we're gonna build
ourselves a little platform to sit this
puppy on the USB type-c port is the one
I'm most worried about it's the most
likely to short in the event of a
problem and it's the one that I'm having
the most trouble getting what I would
consider to be a trustworthy seal around
let's just go ahead and take on more
hoping for the best every day because we
don't have another way right now I can't
put it down luck
Oh Oh gross
that's gross
I'll do it four times
so we're getting water out of the fridge
I'm going for the lowest temperatures
that I can get on the MacBook over there
and now it's time for the poor
oh well more poor now we want a fairly
good volume of water in the pan I could
have put it lower down and then we'd
have been able to we'd been able to cool
the MacBook a little bit sooner but the
reason we want that is we don't want the
water to heat up right away so we want a
fairly high thermal capacity for our
water oh oh you can see the surface
tension of the water has actually let it
make contact with the bottom of the
macbook now now we're gonna have to move
fast because we're not gonna have long
here but check this out our memory has
fallen all the way down to 28 degrees
our CPU temperatures have fallen
although the individual core is
curiously are still reasonably high
that's interesting that means this
thermal sensor is somewhere else and our
SSD has also dropped down to about 24
degrees so now and check this out we are
turbo at the maximum 2 gigahertz in
spite of the fact that we still have a
stability test running so let's stop
that and let's fire up Cinebench so our
CPU temps are way down now - like 32
degrees that is much lower than our idle
temperatures before we started here this
is what we're gonna want to watch here
core speed as well as our CPU
temperatures so we're quite a ways
through our test we're still running at
2 gigahertz we haven't seen this before
air cooled so it looks like that is
definitely a thermal limit as opposed to
a power delivery limit on the the
Broadwell processor inside the MacBook
2015 look at it go it's not throttling
at all it's staying max turbo thanks to
better cooling now this will tell us
something about the way the chassis
itself is being cooled by what we're
doing so you can see our max time
on the top is almost 13 degrees cooler
than our max temperature on the top of
the notebook last time so it's not just
the bottom of the notebook that's being
cooled thanks to Apple's unibody design
that's intended to be used as a heat
spreader that cooling is actually
occurring over the entire body of the
macbook and there we go we have our
score Wow look at that double the score
from water cooling your MacBook right
there suckers so in conclusion would I
recommend water cooling the MacBook 2015
retina no don't be an idiot would it
make it perform better if we actually
had like it waterproofed and then if we
had like tubes going in and out like if
we had a coolant like a water-cooled
cooling pad for it with like direct
contact or something would it make it
perform better the answer is a
resounding yes I'm actually blown away
by how much better that performed so I
guess all that's left now is to throw a
shout out to our Bros over at D brand
Canadian company they make vinyl skins
and wraps for foams devices like this
you may have actually noticed this one
sports a carbon fiber D brand skin on
the bottom and a kind of leather finish
deep brand skin on the top game consoles
all kinds of good stuff like that
they're reasonably priced and
precision-cut absolutely gorgeously
beautiful if you want to check out
anymore like really nice glam close-up
footage of D brand skin on this
particular macbook 2015 then you can
check out our macbook 2015 review right
around here but guys go check it out
they've got a link in the video
description thanks to D brand for making
this video possible thanks to you guys
for making this video possible by
watching it like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you thought it just
plain suck leave a comment if your
feelings are a little more complicated
than that and I have a feeling some of
you are gonna have complicated feelings
about water cooling the MacBook and as
always don't forget to also check out
the link in the video description to our
community forum where you can join and
discuss stuff you can also buy a cool
t-shirt like this one change Ramazan
bookmarks one with our affiliate code
that kind of thing helps us out a lot
and as always don't forget to subscribe
and follow in all of that
good stuff I can't believe this worked I
can't believe it's not dead oh is it
dead no it's not dead oh wow the touch
pads like chili 17 degree touchpad
suckas 17 degrees that does</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
