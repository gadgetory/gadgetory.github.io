Chevy cats versus dogs or PC versus Mac
I think there comes a time in every
enthusiasts life when he asks himself I
mean it's the grass really greener on my
side of the fence or do those other guys
know something that I don't so given
that Apple is now offering not only the
usual os10 experience but also an
entirely unique piece of hardware in the
new 27-inch iMac that I would have
wanted the opportunity to check out
anyway a 5k Retina display I decided to
pick one up but to justify the expense
of an iMac because you can bet your
bottle did not send us a sample we've
got quite a lineup of content planned
around it including today's general
overview a separate video of my thoughts
as a longtime PC user after using the
Mac as my daily driver at work for a few
weeks and more so make sure you're
subscribed so you don't miss any of I
switched to Mac 2014 corsair gaming RGB
keyboards feature precision Cherry MX
RGB key switches for sixteen point eight
million color per key backlighting for
virtually unlimited customization click
now to learn more now from any of you
this won't be anything new before you
power it on the late 2014 unibody
27-inch iMac is not markedly different
from the previous generation one but for
me opening it up was actually an
entirely novel experience the last time
I used an iMac it had a brightly colored
bubble on the back of its tube display
and the last time I even saw one up
close they were still the thicker white
design I mean it's not like I've never
been to an Apple store before and it's
not like I willfully ignored them I just
didn't ever care enough to walk up and
inspect them closely so I opened it up
and I was just struck by the excellence
of the packaging on the PC itself and
the accessories which include one power
cord that plugs into the back of the
unit to power the monitor and the PC
inside a 10 keyless scissor switch Mac
keyboard and a Magic Mouse you also get
a Quick Start Guide some important
information to Apple stickers and a
cleaning cloth then I was struck by how
light the machine is I mean it's not
like you can lift it with one finger
light or anything like that but still
got some heft to it at just under 10
kilograms but if I didn't know better
you could probably have convinced me
that it's just a monitor in there and I
wouldn't have batted an eye and boy is
it ever beautiful speaking of batting
eyes we can talk about hardware specs
all day and don't worry that's coming
but sometimes it's not about hardware
specs sometimes people buy a Jag instead
of hot rodding a neon because they want
the experience of driving a Jag more
than they just want to go fast and while
I'm not necessarily one of those folks I
do get it this computer starts at twenty
five hundred dollars but when you look
at it at least it actually looks like it
cost twenty five hundred dollars
something that most gaming PC's don't
really manage to do even if they have
more horses under the hood and in some
cases a lot more so we'll begin at the
back where we find the thick solid
silver aluminum stand with a built in
cable management hole for power that
looks a wonderfully elegant and is
definitely strong enough to hold the
machine but feels a little bit limited
for something that I just paid this much
for all it can do is tilt and I guess
swivel if you want to physically rotate
the computer if you want height adjust
you can get a stand for your desk a
fairly an elegant solution and if you
want pin it and didn't buy the version
of the iMac 5k with a pre-installed base
amount on the back then go cry in the
corner because you can't remove the
original stand without a complete
teardown
other than that the back is pretty bare
there's a massive Apple logo that you
can put the included stickers next to if
you want to really show people a little
cool value are there's a tiny microphone
at the back of the display at the top
that you can use for video calls I'm
sorry excuse me FaceTime calls kind of
get used to the new lingo and there's an
exhaust vent for the during light
workloads so far stunningly quiet
cooling system moving down there's the
power button and rear and also front I
guess IO unfortunate design compromise
number two I think the
our button is fine just give your PC
wheel reach-around
fumble back there for a bit and turn it
on but well the Gigabit Ethernet port
and for that matter dual Thunderbolt 2
ports won't need to be accessed often I
mean only when you will need to plug in
a new RAID controller or up to a single
external 4k monitor or dual 1440p
monitors the 4 USB 3 ports SDXC reader
which I'm thankful is included by the
way and headphone jack all will and will
probably result in scratches on your
beautiful machine at some point if you
don't want to clutter your workspace
with external hubs or dongles which you
might end up needing to do anyway
because my assumption that the headphone
jack could also be used with a
microphone via a 4-pole adapter was
incorrect that is just a headphone jack
so if you want to like that isn't on the
back of your PC you will need something
like this moving around to the sides
makes my anger subside a little bit
because I can focus on the beauty of the
machine again the edges are perfectly
finished the glass is exactly even with
the aluminum image is truly remarkable
and the edges are a mere 5 millimeters
thick on the sides and top with only the
bottom taken up by speaker ports and air
intakes for cooling the internals boy is
she ever pretty which I guess leads us
to the front yes whether she's more than
a pretty face or not remains to be seen
over the next couple of weeks of using
this computer at work as my daily driver
but she sure has a pretty face her 5k
display features a massive 50 160 by
2880 60 Hertz panel for an effective
core drooping of the pixel count and
effective doubling of the resolution of
a 1440p monitor with a custom Apple
t-con or timing controller to make this
a single tiled display which is
mind-blowing given that single tile 4k
60 Hertz monitors started arriving a
mere six months ago its IPS so colors
pop although like all Apple displays
even if the rumours that it's using the
same panel as the upcoming Dell you p27
one 5k which has a 10 bit per channel
color support panel are
true is limited to 8 bit per channel
color due to OS and application support
although that isn't really a problem
unless you spend your whole day looking
at grayscale gradients if you spend more
of your time watching movies editing
photos etc you will love it and all its
pre-calibrated goodness colours pop or
don't if you select a flatter pre-made
profile text is phenomenally crisp even
if your face is inches from the screen
and the viewing angles are outstanding
say what you will about glossy displays
and their disadvantages if you're in a
room without strong backlighting you
know so you don't have to use it as a
vanity mirror they sure look nice when
they're positioned correctly which I
guess leads us finally to spec time one
of the arguments I found online for why
Apple went with a whopping 14 and a half
megapixel 5k display versus a more
mundane 4k one I mean we're talking
about 75% more pixels here is to allow
video editors to work on a native 4k
preview with tools spread out around it
but I don't know if I buy that I mean
it's a good computer with up to a core
i7 4790k although that K is going to be
underutilized you won't be able to
blocking it up to 32 gigs of ram and r9
and 295x2 a taste for gig GPU and a
three and a half inch drive mount to go
along with apples proprietary PCI
Express based SSD but I feel like for
serious content creation this argument
would have been stronger for a dual tile
5k cinema display for use with the Mac
Pro and for the consumer grade iMac
Ultra HD might have been a better bet
for it for no other reason than that it
would allow apples target display mode a
way of recycling your iMac in the future
as a monitor once the internal guts are
outdated to work with the 5k retina iMac
what-you-see-is-what-you-get so stick
with us over the next few weeks to find
out if what you get is amazing and
magical enough to justify its $2,500
starting price point
