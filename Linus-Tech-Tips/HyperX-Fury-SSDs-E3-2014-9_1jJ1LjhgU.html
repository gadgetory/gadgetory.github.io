exactly Fury is fury is hype Rex's new
entry level line of products so this one
in particular is a fury SSD this fury
SSD is running a 2281 SandForce
controller synchronous NAND flash it
comes in 120 and 240 gigabyte capacities
and has a 500 500 read/write speed so
it's solid it's not necessarily the
highest-end thing you're gonna find but
it's extremely solid so why are you
interested I've seen a lot of trending
lately where people are buying SSDs at
this level because it makes a lot of
sense it's a huge noticeable difference
from a hard drive but it doesn't cost as
much as maybe the extreme level
performance drives which you aren't
going to see as big of an incremental
performance boost from a hard drive so
if you're upgrading an old system if
you're augmenting a system that you're
building at this point in time if you're
doing anything like that it might make a
ton of sense on top of all the
performance features you also get a
three-year warranty and global tech
support global tech support might not be
something you think is valuable now but
in the future when something dies it
becomes valuable very quickly so it's
not something to overlook also the price
for performance of this Drive is
something to to pay attention to if
you're building a system and you are
paying a lot of attention to price
performance which honestly most people
do when they're building systems this
might be a drive you want to look at all
