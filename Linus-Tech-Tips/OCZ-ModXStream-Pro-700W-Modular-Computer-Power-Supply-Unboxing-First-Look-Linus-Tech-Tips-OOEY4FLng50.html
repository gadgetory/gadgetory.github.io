watt power supply it's available in a
couple different capacities used to be a
400 watt version even but there are 500
watt 600 watt and 700 watt versions this
is one of the most popular power
supplies out there right now so let's go
through a quick quick rundown of this
particular unit first of all it is
powerful 700 watts excellent thank you
then it is ultra efficient so this is an
80 plus certified power supply with 135
millimeter fan active PFC and an easy
mod cable management system we'll have a
close look at that when we open it up it
includes a three-year ocz warranty which
is legendary and it also has nvidia sli
stamp of approval on it so that pretty
much covers everything they tell us on
the front of it first of all actually
well there are a couple things on the
back and I'll read those out while I'm
ma while I'm breaking all the seals on
this because it's quite well packed in
here and I'm gonna have oh oh that
explains that I'm using the using the
blunt edge of my knife to to cut while I
have my finger on the sharp edge that
could have turned out very very badly
but at least it would have been on video
so it would have been very exciting okay
the power consumption is less than or
equal to one watt in off mode and in
standby mode so that has some kind of a
little green leaf next to that sticker
so I guess that's relevant somehow and
then there is also oh that's kind of
cool so it's tested at ultra high
temperatures 40 degrees centigrade
versus a lot of other power supplies
which are actually rated at
unrealistically low temperatures so that
they can inflate the rated wattages okay
so that's a pretty good thing to know
and then what else there was something
else on the back but I wanted to to tell
you a lot about before I go ahead and
open this what did they have multi-gpu
ready okay we already know that no that
was pretty much it
okay so let's get this thing open and
let's get kind of angled down and zoomed
in and I have no cameraman on this fine
day that's okay so the first thing we
will find is a user's manual which is an
English Dutch Espanola phone say
italiano Netherlands okay a bunch of
stuff I really don't know how to
pronounce anymore and that tells you
just the basics installation and
troubleshooting thank you
alright then next we will find the power
supply there's not a whole lot in here
in terms of accessories I mean these are
a very
great value I can go ahead and I can say
that so you can't really expect the
whole nine yards in terms of accessories
but here's the little box that holds all
of the cables here is your power cable
it's just a pretty wussy looking power
cable but realistically it's all you'll
need for a 700 watt power supply and a
computer running off of it this I really
like it comes with a little nice little
mesh bag this looks kind of like a
pencil bag it includes your modular
cables and it also includes four screws
for mounting the power supply thank you
for that let's have a look at the power
supply itself and then we'll have a look
at the modular cables quite a nice
looking unit actually right off the bat
here so you've got your mod Xtreme label
on the side here it's 700 Watts you got
that that's that little green leaf
sticker I was talking about before 80s
here's all of your your testing stickers
showing that it did pass all of its
testing if yours doesn't have these
maybe a flat ocz note on the back you'll
find you're fairly standard honeycomb
grille and then you've got a power
switch as well as a power plug input
here you will find the the rail
breakdown for this unit so this is a
dual 12 volt rail power supply and
you've got 25 amps on each rail they are
capable of providing 552 watts of the
total 700 Watts that this power supply
can provide
there's your ad + logo as well as all of
your safety certifications on the front
you will find the modular interface as
well as the cables that are included by
default so these two look like they're
gonna be four PCI Express while these
two are black so these are red PCI
Express these black ones look like
they're going to be from molex and Stata
so let's see what's actually included on
this power supply OCC has gone with a
fairly modular interface I've actually
seen a lot of modular power supplies
that include like they include like a 24
pin an 8 pin a couple PCI Express molex
and SATA cables all hardwired to the
power supply and then they have like two
modular plugs on them I think that's
just kind of ridiculous so here we go
we've got a 24 pin power connector
hardwired then also hardwired we have
our 8 pin power and our 4 pin power so
you'll either use this one or this one I
I'm not a big fan of that just because
then you're stuck with cables but you
might not even be beat well you've
pretty much won't be using unless you're
powering like a EVGA board that requires
both the 4 pin and an 8 pin so that's
okay
in terms of modular cables these don't
look very long do they actually all of
these cables are pretty short on this
particular unit that's not that long at
all I mean it should be fine as long as
your power supplies mounted in the top
of your case or as long as you don't
have to go around a lot of obstacles to
mount tor to get the cables up to your
motherboard so why don't we get this
kind of zoomed back out I went the wrong
way hold on bear with me here sorry
about that
okay modular cables so here is your PCI
Express 8 pin connector so plugs in or
this is a 6 pin pardon me so this plugs
into the power supply that's 8 pins but
there are two empty ones see just like
that so that's a 6 pin connector and
then the other one actually makes use of
all 8 pins and you can see that it has a
6 plus 2 pin connector on the other end
all right then and the other modular
cables are they don't give you many
options with this one I like modular
power supplies that include extra cables
so they'll include like three molex and
three SATA even though there's only four
modular plugs so if you have a very hard
drive heavy build or very other
accessory heavy build you can kind of go
one way or the other but it doesn't
really defeat the purpose because it
still allows you to just not plug in the
cables that you don't need even if
they're only including exactly what
would be attached to the power supply
anyway that was very long and very
rambley but that's okay so we've got two
molex cables each of which has two molex
connectors on it and one floppy
connector these are again fairly short
but it should be fine like I said once
again if you are using a fairly small
case and you have a top mounted power
supply so you can see it's got about
that kind of length on it then the same
length again we have two SATA cables and
each of which has three SATA connectors
so you can connect a total of six SATA
power supply of SATA power supplies six
SATA hard drives to this power supply
without any kind of adapters or anything
else thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the OCZ
mod extreme pro 700-watt modular power</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
