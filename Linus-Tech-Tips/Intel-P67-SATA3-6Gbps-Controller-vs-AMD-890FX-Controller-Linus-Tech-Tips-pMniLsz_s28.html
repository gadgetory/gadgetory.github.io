test since the intel SSD 510 series
drives came out and I finally got a
chance to do it I've replaced on my test
bench my Intel p67 a GD 65 and I have
put in a similar top-of-the-line AMD
configuration with an 1100 T the same
RAM same video card and I replaced it
with an eight ninety FX board from
gigabyte this is actually the 890 FX AUD
five now what's interesting about eight
ninety FX boards is that they all have
say 236 gigabit per second and unlike
p67 boards which have anywhere from two
to four with only two of them running
off the intel chipset and the other two
usually running off a third-party
chipset all six of the SE 236 gigabit
per second ports on an AMD 890 FX board
are running off of the chipset so you
can run up to six say 236 gigabit per
second rides but what is the performance
of the AMD chipset solution versus the
Intel one so I have attempted to at
least give us some idea of what the
answer would be so here on the left you
can see the AMD score and on the right
you can see my saved Intel score with a
single Drive running it's a 236 gigabit
per second so you can see for reads the
AMD controller doesn't quite hit the
same sequential read speeds whereas
everything else is actually fairly
similar so for random performance the
AMD controller is on par and for
sequential reads it falls behind a
little bit and other than that it's
pretty much right there so as long as
the CPU you choose is a good performer
compared to whatever Intel platform
would have been equivalent it looks like
if you're running a say 236 gigabit per
second drive such as this one there's
not going to be too much of a
disadvantage other than just this one I
thing to running an AMD motherboard
based on a tiny FX so thanks for
