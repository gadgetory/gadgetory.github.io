mechanoid is both a toy and a robotics
kit it's being touted as a personal
robot best friend they say you can build
anything and that programming is easy
and innovative they say your kid will
learn the core values of science
technology engineering and mathematics
then you might think from all the
positive reviews that the mechanoid is
great but let me tell you something the
mechanoid is a terrible disappointment
it's an offensively bad box of empty
promises and all those positive reviews
are only looking at the mechanoid at a
superficial level it's going to be
pretty interesting for me to be the sole
voice of dissent on this one so let's
get into it shall we
I by powers revolt 2 has been redesigned
from the ground up to utilize its small
form-factor to hold the power you need
to gain with confidence check out their
link in the video description to learn
more let me give you my thesis statement
right off the top the mechanoid is a
robotics building platform in name only
because in reality everything that makes
the robotics kit good has been
sacrificed and compromised to blindly
serve a singular objective to make this
thing as cute as possible
so that it will sell as a result the
pieces are miss shapen the instructions
are a mess the assembly process is
tedious the programming options are
laughably simplistic and the price tag
is a bloated $400 opening up the box for
the meccanoid g15 KS we see the 1188
pieces of which 961 are actually just
nuts and bolts leaving 245 plastic
pieces that actually comprise the robot
itself now traditional Meccano Meccano
Meccano potato potato whatever Meccano
pieces are actually made out of metal
but the mechanoid pieces are plastic I'm
guessing because a fully metal robot of
this size would just be absurdly
expensive to produce of course you could
just make it smaller but then it
wouldn't have the cool factor that they
seem to be banking on what makes these
pieces truly awful is not the fact that
they're made out of plastic but the fact
that they are such enormous weird and
specialized shapes you see traditional
Meccano pieces are modular and simple
allowing the Builder to be creative with
them but pretty much everything in the
GK 15 s's box was specifically designed
to build one robot technically you can
build anything you like but the pieces
poor design makes this enormous ly
difficult there aren't nearly enough
attachment holes to use and the few that
there are are not always positioned
logically there are also these random
studs that poke out and completely get
in the way making many configurations
impossible the studs don't even serve to
hold stuff together they just simply
prevent pieces from sliding around while
you attach them with the nuts and bolts
I mean what on earth am I supposed to do
with this
or this or this they seriously couldn't
break these up into smaller more
constituent parts with mounting points
at predictable intervals the only
positive feature of these pieces is that
many of them have square indentations
designed to hold the nuts in place for
when you're bolting everything together
during assembly so let's talk about that
shall we
even though the designers decided to
abandon the tried-and-true metal pieces
that Meccano is so well known for they
still decided to keep the traditional
nut and bolt attachment system something
that people already complain about
perhaps this was done to maintain
compatibility with the traditional metal
pieces but no self-respecting builder is
going to go anywhere near these plastic
atrocities so frankly I don't see the
point
surely there must be a simpler way for
kids to quickly attach these pieces
together some kind of pin system that
snaps in place perhaps nope instead your
10 year old will be stuck assembling
this oversized monstrosity for hours and
hours of just screwing together pieces
using these tiny nuts and bolts all 961
of them the entire process took me eight
tedious hours and unlike building
something out of Lego I did not find it
interesting or enjoyable and that's
partly due to the dreadful instructions
which are so bad for so many reasons
often they'll combine several steps into
one which greatly increases the chance
of doing something wrong plus there's
almost never an image that shows what a
fully assembled step is supposed to look
like and you can't just look at the next
step for that because the model on the
page undergoes constant changes in
orientation also sometimes you have to
use a slightly different nut or bolt but
because they're all the same color it's
not immediately obvious I hope you
didn't accidentally mix any of these
bolts together even while paying very
close attention I still made several
mistakes which can take quite a while to
realize and even longer to fix because
it usually involves disassembling some
correct parts so that you can get to the
incorrect parts but ladies and gentlemen
the disappointment doesn't stop there
with everything finally attached and
plugged in correctly the mechanoid runs
through a start-up diagnostic routine
for your name and enters the main menu
you have to use voice commands to
navigate the menus which kind of feels
like I'm on the phone with my cell phone
provider or say list commands to hear
all commands if you are still having
trouble please go - w-w-w-what you do
have to repeat yourself sometimes and
you also have to wait for the mechanoid
to stop talking before it will listen
for your commands which can take a while
here's a list of all the mechanoids menu
commands it can tell jokes and tell you
what time it is which is exactly as
exciting as it sounds
walk with me seems to work fine but
doesn't look like it can move backwards
in this mode shake hands and high-five
work pretty much just as you would
expect them to the motion control
commands also seem to work fine
it all works it's just not really that
interesting forward now the website
lists three innovative ways to program
so let's take a look at that the first
one Li M or learned intelligent movement
allows you to physically move the robots
arms around which can be recorded and
replayed along with your voice I have to
admit I did have some fun with this one
no no disassemble you can then save this
to the Li M library and recall it later
however it's not nearly as precise as
the commercials would imply necking away
two souls in the program right robot run
it can't play the piano
moving on to ragdoll avatar you can use
your smartphone to directly remote
control the movements of the mechanoid
this also works pretty well you can even
change the colors of the LEDs if you
really want to and finally motion
capture mode uses your smartphone's
camera to record your movements which
the mechanoid will attempt to mimic this
one really does not work very well
sometimes the arms would flop around
even while my own arms remain completely
stationary and that's it it's just three
different ways you can tell the
robot to make noise and wave its arms
around which can be recorded and
replayed I don't consider that to be
programming for the real programming you
can download this arduino library but
this only became available quite
recently so it was obviously never
really a priority well I guess if you
understand C++ you can program the
mechanoid any way you like but honestly
why would you want to and tell me what
is the point of having arms if the hands
don't do anything it would be cool if
the hands actually worked and the
fingers could grasp objects and pick
stuff up but they can't which is boring
I guess you could take it apart and
build the dinosaur you know if you want
another ten tedious hours of bolting
stuff together but that sounds pretty
boring too now some of you may be
thinking hey my kids enjoyed the
mechanoid and this guy isn't ten years
old so why should his opinions matter
well guess what I was a kid once and I
remembered that the best toys were the
ones with great replay value the toys I
kept playing with and coming back to
time and time again for me this was Lego
Nintendo Pokemon game maker 5 I still
have all that stuff and the other toys
they probably went to the trash or the
thrift store once assembled there's so
little you can do with the mechanoid
that I don't see how it's going to
maintain the interest of most children
beyond I don't know a week or two and
after that I predict the novelty will
wear off and it'll be pushed into a
corner and never played with again the
mechanoid is so terrible in fact that it
feels to me like some other company
designed it and then just slap the
Meccano label on top which is kind of
funny because I wrote those words and
then later discovered that it's actually
true yes my friends it turns out the
Meccano was acquired in 2013 by a
company called Spin Master oh it all
makes sense now
Spin Master are the ones to blame for
this mess look at this article
apparently their idea of a Renaissance
is to add a bunch of cheap cutesy
colorful crap into the Meccano lineup ok
ok Spin Master I know you're watching
and I've got something to say to you
Meccano has existed for over a
years because they made good quality
long-lasting interesting products please
try to exercise some responsibility and
restraint so that you don't completely
drive them into the ground with
flash-in-the-pan products like the
mechanoid and hey I've got a toy idea
for you how about a full metal Makana
robot with wheels gears axles beams LEDs
several motors and a full array of
sensors give it a fully programmable
brain with remote control and give us
instructions for building cool stuff and
then price it competitively now that's a
great robotics kit that would support
STEM education vex robotics figured this
out and so can you and now let's see if
I can sell this thing maybe I can trade
it in for a better toy at toy traders
yeah that's right you don't want them at
all right ok thanks a lot yeah buh-bye
they won't even take it at toy traders
if the mechanoid was just an overly
expensive toy I wouldn't care but
they're selling it as if it's a stem
educational robotics kit and it's just
not the mechanoid completely fails to
deliver enough fun or educational value
to justify its $400 price tag ok
everyone that's all that's all I have to
say I'm just I'm still I'm so shocked at
all the positive reviews for this thing
do you think I'm missing something am I
wrong
leave a comment below with your thoughts
and did you play with traditional
Meccano growing up what did you think of
it leave a comment about that too and go
ahead and slap a like on this video or a
dislike get subscribed or don't whatever
check out our forums buy a t-shirt I
promise none of them cost $400 and check
out my review of the vex IQ super kit if
you want to see what a proper robotics
kit looks like and hopefully I'll have a
review of the Mindstorms ev3 coming soon
as well see you next time
