of a random card on my test bench it's
not actually an EVGA 8800 it's an ax
soos 8800 GTX with an EVGA ultra cooler
on it and there is a very good reason I
have this here now it's been about three
years since the launch of the 8800 GT
and three years is according to
invidious internal research anyway about
the average upgrade cycle time for a
gamer so I want to have a look at what
gamers who bought the original DirectX
10 GPUs so that's a full DirectX
generation ago that is the 8800 gtx 800
GTS 8800 ultra and really the 8800 GT
they all fall into kind of a performance
range that's within about 20 to 30
percent of each other what do they get
by upgrading to what is now by all
appearances the DirectX 11 bang for the
buck GPU to have the GTX 560 Ti so
here's another interesting point to kind
of look at the steam hardware survey
actually reveals that to do 72% of
gamers are still on DirectX 10 so you
can imagine that Nvidia is really hoping
that a lot of those guys who upgraded to
DirectX 10 you know two to three years
ago and are getting to the end of the
life cycle of their card are going to
upgrade to one of these so let's have a
look at what the benefit is of upgrading
to a GTX 560 Ti from an older generation
card such as this one so I'm loading my
saved game called image quality compare
and I just want to talk a little bit
about what things we are going to be
observing here so first of all I want
you guys to check out the frame rate in
the top right corner so it's up around
so this is my image quality compare
savegame I want you to notice a few
things about it first of all we are
running on all medium details this is
with the 8800 GTX you can see the frame
rate up in the corner is around 50
frames per second now some people would
probably argue that this is like too
high and the human eye can only see
30fps blah blah blah but personally I do
find I notice a difference at higher
than 50 fps honestly my ideal is around
60 Plus although 50 is very very
playable but I will actually show you
guys why so I'm going to do still
screenshots for you to compare and you
can flip YouTube into 1080p too to
really look at it closely but the stuff
you're going to want to focus on
actually I'm going to go here back to
the beginning is that things like
anti-aliasing so if you look closely at
parts of the image like the trees you're
going to notice that with the with the
lower image quality settings you're
going to have more more jaggies on
leaves or on things like the tree trunks
you can see there they're quite jagged
especially while you're moving the
effect is is very noticeable anyway I'm
going to sort of demonstrate why I don't
believe that 30fps
when you're in a still scene is enough
because you check check this out okay so
as soon as I do something like run
around and blow up a barrel
boom ik dips so for me I want the
framerate to never dip below 30fps
because when there's explosions going on
and you're moving fast around the map
and there's lots of enemy characters
being drawn that's exactly the time when
you need all of the performance that you
can get and if your framerate dips at
that critical time you're going to miss
a shot or you're going to accidentally
drive off a cliff or or whatever
whatever can happen while you're not
able to properly see what exactly you're
doing so here you can see I'm driving
and it looks like I managed to cut off
the framerate counter in the top there
yet so I've got fraps running in the top
corner and it's around 40 fps so anyway
yes this is all medium details with the
8800
ETX you know what crisis looks great
crisis looks great on an 8800 GT X and
I'm going to show you guys in a minute
how much even more better it can look
with a gtx 560 TI
okay guys I've got my GTX 560 Ti on the
test bench now this is a an Intel Core
i7 2600
to 4.7 gigahertz so we shouldn't be
seeing too much in terms of CPU
bottlenecking now I'm at that very same
scene right when I first load my image
quality compare save point and you can
see we're up around 115 frames per
second now there is no image quality
difference for running at 115 frames per
second versus running at 50 frames per
second nothing nada not at all now
motion might be a little bit more fluid
especially if you're running on a 120
Hertz monitor like the one I have here
remember anything about 60 frames per
second is not going to really help you
out when you're running on a 60 Hertz
monitor because it can only display 60
frames per second Wow whereas a 120
Hertz monitor is capable of more so here
I'm just going to show you guys like
what happens to the framerate when we
blow up a barrel instead of dipping down
to you know the 35 to 40 range we're
dipping down to the 95 range so you
won't even feel a dip so what do you do
as soon as you start being able to run a
game at insane frame rates well you turn
up the details so I'm going to turn
everything up to high and we're going to
do our image quality comparison I'll
show you guys the screenshots at the end
of the video and we'll see even on an
old this is an old title old DirectX 10
title how much of a difference a video
card upgrade can make for you if you
haven't done one in a few years so I'm
loading that very same save game and one
thing you guys are probably going to
notice right off the bat is that up here
my frame rate is a little bit lower than
it was when I was running on the 8800 GT
X so the reason is that I've turned the
details way way up and what I've also
noticed about the 560 Ti is that when
things get hairy
it doesn't dip down nearly to the same
degree that the 8800 GT XS so you can
see that textures are much much better
shadows are softer a lot more dynamic
more realistic looking we've got like
you know God raised going through the
through the light that passes through
the trees just way more processing
effects the water looks better and even
when you know all I walk to close whoops
okay well let's try that one more time
even when I you know start blowing
things up explosions look more realistic
and the framerate really doesn't dip
down below 35 or so frames per second
which is acceptable even when the action
gets intense so I'm actually just going
to go for my little my little cruise
down the road here and I just want to
demonstrate that even when things get
hairy that my frame rate is going to
stay satisfactory now 35 frames per
second I would consider more than
acceptable for single-player but for a
multiplayer game yeah I would probably I
would probably compromise some of that
image quality for a higher frame rate
just to make sure that it's being drawn
on my screen before the other guy but in
the case of single-player really eye
candy is a big part of the experience so
you know let's go find some some dudes
to kill and then you guys can watch the
framerate and please don't watch my
terrible gaming skills because yes I'm
playing uneasy and yes I'm still not
doing that well what are you going to do
and now I died so thank you for checking
out my video on what kind of image
quality increases you can get if you
take your old DirectX 10 class video
card and upgrade it to the new gtx 560
TI with DirectX 11 and really more than
anything else a lot more horsepower so
that's how much different it can be even
with an older DirectX 10 game image
quality screenshot comparison coming
actually here's one other interesting
tidbit my power consumption was only
about wow about 5% higher at its peak
with the GTX 560 versus the 8800 GT X so
that's just phenomenal you get that much
more performance that much better image
quality without any
our budget when you upgrade to a GTX 560
TI
