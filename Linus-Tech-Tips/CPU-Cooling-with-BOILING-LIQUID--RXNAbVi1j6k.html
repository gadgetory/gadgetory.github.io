there's a few different reasons people
do it some do it for performance you
know getting them over clocks some
people do it for looks although that
clearly wasn't the case here and some do
it for silence now here's the thing
though no matter how many radiators you
throw at your system like you could put
like six radiators on this thing you
could take all the fans off and it would
easily dissipate the heat from a CPU in
a graphics card you are still going to
be stuck with at least one moving part
and that's your pump
now sometimes pumps take the form of
like a big standalone piece like this
like with a custom loop while other
times you're gonna have it kind of built
in or integrated into something else so
this a IO from NZXT has the pump built
into the CPU block while others I
believe ek does this for example build
it into the radiator but you're always
gonna have that moving part which is a
point of failure and a source of noise
unless you don't this right here is a
prototype water cooler with no pump how
on earth does that work how well does it
work I guess there's only one way to
find out in there by sitting through
this sponsor spot from P I a private
Internet access keeps your IP hidden
from anyone who wants to know and allows
you to access services online as though
you are from a different country check
it out at the link in the video
description
so I first got turned on to the idea of
pumpless water cooling when I was
reading a post on extreme systems org
that's a blast from the past way back in
2008 so a user by the name of ocz Tony
who worked at you guessed it ocz at the
time was doing some experimentation with
their upcoming CPU water block which I'm
not sure if it ever got released or not
but it's hardly the point
and he posted that he had figured out a
way to use convection just the natural
convection of the heat of the CPU
warming the water causing it to rise up
one tube and then get cooled by the
radiator causing it to fall down the
other tube in order to achieve enough
circulation to get a functional like
custom grade water cooling loop all
without any risk of failing components
and without any noise whatsoever
Tony's approach had a couple of fatal
flaws though so for one thing it wasn't
possible to get a ton of circulation so
modern CPUs like the 18 core one in here
we're gonna have no chance of moving
enough water to carry all that heat away
and number two is that it relied on a
very specific layout of the entire
system so that the convection action
could get started in the first place so
the radiator would absolutely need to be
above the CPU socket and then once
you've started to add multiple heat
sources like you know a graphics card or
something well then life gets really
confusing fortunately there are other
ways to move fluid around inside a
closed system take this for example this
looks like an ordinary PC tower cooler
but inside these heat pipes are tiny
capillaries that allow the coolant to
flow up and down the heat pipe in order
to allow it to transport heat much more
quickly than just solid tubes of metal
would be able to do that's part of what
makes these things so efficient so when
a nutshell then capillary action is the
phenomenon that you would observe if you
took a cup of water and
and something thin like a straw for
example and stuck it in you would
actually see that the water level inside
the straw would rise a little bit even
though the force of gravity is working
against it it's partly caused by surface
tension and it is the exact principle
that our cooler here works on now I only
gave you guys a really brief look at
this before but now we're going to take
a bit of a closer gander so first we've
got a bog-standard radiator I think it's
made I think it's made of aluminum and
then we've got our CPU block here which
looks pretty normal
you've got your flat copper base and
there's only really a couple things
about it that strike me as not ordinary
so one is this little kind of looks like
a full port of some sort that's been
terminated by pinching it shut kind of
like you would do with the heat pipe and
to the fact that the fittings the block
itself everything about this thing is
like soldered shut
rather than using a rings and screws in
order to seal it they they are serious
about keeping whatever's in here inside
but will it work
now this is 10 out of 10 engineering
sample stuff Rajon Tech sent it over but
this is like this is not to be evaluated
for its performance or the packaging or
anything like that this is just a
concept stage device which means that
mounting this is probably not going to
be that simple there's no instructions
so that kind of looks like it goes there
that kind of looks like it goes there
and they and there it really does just
look like cobbled together from scrap
metal they found in the warehouse or
something these thumb screws are just
spacers these are these are thumb screws
well you only live once especially if
you're this poor CPU with my favorite
thing about oh no did it go in the power
supply I'll screw in your power supply
is a bad friggin time one of the nuts
appears to have gone missing well
hopefully we have an alternative nut oh
heck yeah then that's from my test bench
work I was easy I didn't have to go very
far at all we're also gonna need a
couple of cooling fans did they say
something about it needing to be above
try remember yeah now there's something
for sure what so because this process is
heat assistant we're not actually
expecting it to start flowing right away
like how would it do that what would
power it so we're actually waiting for
the heat output from the CPU to move the
water around we're converting heat
energy into mechanical energy but that
means if there's no load on the CPU then
it's gonna take a while for it to get
hot enough down here to begin that
process and then you can see here our
CPU is clearly not putting out a ton of
heat
and that is a hefty copper block on it
so it's gonna take a while for it to
appreciably heat up now that CPU is
pretty toasty at this point you actually
see we're getting some more bubble on
wool we're getting some real bubble
action here there's a big there's a big
bubble look at it go see that it's
actually starting to flow now now what's
interesting is you actually see bubbles
flowing out of both sides now why would
that be so you can see we're getting a
little bit of kind of jerky coolant flow
but CPU temperatures are actually well
within spec it seems to kind of
correspond actually to little bits of
coolant kind of dripping down into the
block so I actually may have recalled
incorrectly this one may rely on some
gravity assistance here so let's go
ahead and provide it so now this is kind
of like having your radiator installed
in the top of your case know as CPU
temps are way down they were up near 90
now they're in this upper 60s and
they're more consistent okay so
theoretically we're all set up properly
ish now you can see that our CPU temps
have settled in at around the low 60s
and that's not great obviously this is
an 8700 K by the way that's not great
for idle temperatures it's not even
doing anything right now but you got to
remember that this doesn't work unless
we add enough heat and it's clearly
working well enough that even though
that's a high idle temperature we're
well within spec so in order to get our
coolant flowing more rapidly and to get
the cooler working better we actually
have to hit it with a load so why don't
we go ahead and do that
turn small FFT 12 3 that's probably
gonna crush this poor thing but let's
give it a shot Wow okay so our temps
shoot up to a hundred degree degrees
basically instantly but what's
interesting is you can see there's a lot
more action down here at the cooler
also gonna want to check out what kind
of clock speed we managed to maintain
throughout this so we're still at 3.7
gigahertz which means we're getting
enough coolant flow that the things not
just like gonna immediately die we hope
now let's have a look at our coolant
flow here
so what's weird is we've actually got
liquid returns on both of these which
would suggest that it's turning to vapor
to move up to this radiator so maybe the
configuration can be tweaked once more
just trying to remember what their
instructions were I could have I could
have looked this up before we started
but what fun would that be sorry I'm
leaving now it's possible that the
design expects the motherboard to be
oriented the way it would in a typical
tower cakes so why don't we go ahead and
do that there we go all right now let's
see how she goes ooh interesting our
temps are down in the high 90s range now
also our speed which had fallen down to
about 3.5 gigahertz is up to three point
six three we're clearly turbo Eng higher
what's weird is that it appears as
though it's operating more like a heat
pipe cooler right now with the thick
tube doing most of both the liquid and
gas movement why use only capillary
action when you can use convection as
well we could tell that all the action
was in our top tube here but the top one
was the thick one so if we were to
change it around and use our skinny one
as the top instead of having those two
forces work against each other you could
hopefully have them work together
we can't use temperatures to
differentiate our orientations here
because they're all going to hit a
hundred degrees in thermal throttle but
what we can see is how far throttles and
this actually throttles a much worse
than our previous configuration now
we're back up to what now we're up to
3.8 gigahertz what is your logic so this
is clearly the hot side and this side is
pretty hot too okay so I gave in I
consulted the materials they sent over
back when they provided this unit and it
appears as though this was the correct
configuration with the small tube on the
bottom the big one on top and the
radiator up above so let's go ahead and
try it one last time so this is the best
result we've gotten so far we've only
got one core that's at a hundred degrees
and we're terming up to about 3.8 mid to
3.8 high gigahertz
that is not a bad result now it's
obviously not a perfect result which is
probably a big part of the reason that
this even though they've shown samples
of it as long as like a year and a half
ago hasn't turned into a commercial
product yet because there's a lot of
fine-tuning to make this work for one
basically endless tuning and tweaking
could be done on the diameter of the
tubes in order to allow for better
coolant flow for another there's all
kinds of different fluids with low
boiling points which is part of what
actually allows this rapid movement that
could be used to charge a system like
this we don't know what they're using
inside I'm sure once they figured out a
formula that works they would hold that
as a very closely guarded trade secret
for another thing
remember how we showed that this whole
system was sealed up well maybe they're
maintaining it at something other than
atmospheric pressure that could also
affect the characteristics of the entire
system so nothing like this is available
from you know any household brand that
you'd recognize
at this point in time but I would say
that this works well enough that there
is still potential for this technology
and I'm personally very excited for the
truly silent water cooler
I mean ignoring that this particular one
has fans on it and that it would be very
difficult to DIY something like this but
details details details oh yeah and the
bubbling does actually make noise you
