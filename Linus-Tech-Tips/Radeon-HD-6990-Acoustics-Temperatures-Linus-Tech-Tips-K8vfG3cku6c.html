slightly different approach to my
temperature and acoustics testing that I
normally do this is with the HD 6990 so
what I'm going to do is instead of
holding my camera here close to the fan
I'm actually going to hold it above the
card right here and the reason I'm going
to do that is because there's two things
I'm going to compare it against I'm
going to compare it against a single GTX
580 and I'm going to compare it against
two GTX 580 s in sli so that'll give us
a comparison against a high-powered
single card as well as two high-powered
cards running in tandem so here's our
idle temperature reading which is 39 to
38 degrees in this particular room all
right so we've got our load temperature
for the Radeon 6990 and that is 82
degrees and oh man you guys can't see
this at all okay any focus focus focus
focus come on focus on my hand focus on
the screen whatever you'll have to take
my word for it 82 degrees and 87 degrees
on each of the GPUs so I'm fairly
certain that the 82 degrees is on this
GPU and the 87 degrees is on this GPU
and I think the reason for that is that
this grille at the back is more
restrictive our FA yeah than this girl
at the front of the card because as soon
as I go like this the cooler GPU starts
to heat up to the same kind of
temperatures as the less cool GPU so
that's something maybe they if you
installed an aftermarket less
restrictive grille on your card you
might have some success keeping down
your GPU temperatures a little bit all
right so right now I'm running only one
of the GPUs at its fan speed at its load
fan speed so this is at 91 degrees in
fur mark so this is the EVGA card that's
running because remember windowed OpenGL
programs will not run an SLI mode and
for my two card acoustics test I'm just
going to take both cards I'm going to
turn them up to the same percentage fan
speed manually
as I can't be bothered to run it in open
are in full-screen mode and change the
exe and all those little tricks so fan
speeds around 80 percent so I'm just
going to turn both fan speeds to 80
percent and take a reading
and just for laughs guys here's 100
percent fans feed on the 6990 although
it never ramped up to this speed during
my testing so I'm going to be turning
off auto in afterburner goalie cat
turning off auto and afterburner and
watch the piece of paper on the wall
when I click apply okay bear in mind the
card is here so it's about yay far away
from the wall okay I'll watch the cat -
this might be funny
see it's lifted away from the wall so in
conclusion the radio on 6990 is pretty
darn loud but it's also pretty darn
powerful don't forget to subscribe to
