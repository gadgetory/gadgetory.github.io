realize that be quiet Wow live now it's
not sponsored you know it is is it Oh
hop ID crying
actually we do have this blood said I
forgot about that completely this is so
it's gonna trigger you so hard Jake hi
this video is brought to you by the
elgato stream deck mini I don't even
have one Taryn took the stream deck so I
don't even get to use it I know they all
dotto stream deck mini features six
fully customizable LCD keys to use the
shortcuts plus easy to use software to
set them up you can check about it at
Amazon or Newegg or at the link in the
video description once it's there once
this video is the archive isn't that
awesome
oh I'm asking Karen yeah you know you
don't have to do this yeah he was
actually trying to get us to him dad not
a mini actually the full-size stream
deck from Terran before we started this
dream and turns like well I have them
and Jake's like right but we have to and
I need one of them okay and turns like
what do you mean I can't have both I
have one and I have the other one I have
both of them
okay so Taryn says Oh Taryn can have it
but I need your help with the social
posts before you take it you trade we're
now we don't need it now don't we
wouldn't even be able to set it up right
now okay what are we doing anyway yeah
so this was just kind of an impromptu
thing we've actually done Black Friday
videos before in the past but they've
typically been kind of like we get into
the office in the morning we try and
find as many Black Friday deals as we
can we produce the video and it goes up
way late and by the time the video goes
up you can't even get out some of the
deals that we that we found anyway
because they're sold out or whatever so
it's it's just been kind of a struggle
I'm not saying we won't go back to that
system later but we thought hey you know
what if we want to be way more timely
about Black Friday why don't we do a
live stream yeah meanwhile it's 2
o'clock Pacific tech link what's that
yeah
mm-hmm anyway so the goal today I think
is pretty simple the three of us are
gonna work together to build the what we
would buy for a Black Friday gaming PC
and the objective is for us to come to a
consensus on what exactly it is that we
would go with we've never really done
anything like this before no in fact fun
fact I have never gone Black Friday
shopping how do you you worked at a
retailer right a Canadian one yeah
couldn't you do well no no we did Black
Friday okay so I haven't been boxing day
shopping
oh thank you Elgato stream deck everyone
except to me this is the mini yes the
mini mini we're gonna put it right here
anyway they can't even see it because
it's like in the top corner right now
because our producer is asleep at the
wheel anyway so I haven't been boxing
today I have an unboxing day shopping in
probably almost 15 years
like actually and I mean going out of my
house I don't mean that I have not like
bought anything online on Boxing Day in
15 years I probably have but like I
don't remember it wasn't a big-ticket
item and I don't think I have ever been
Black Friday shopping okay so you worked
in a retail couldn't you just walk
around the counter and be like oh we got
some good deals no buy stuff that's
exactly it
I worked at a retailer so I was working
at NCIX was nuts because we actually did
stuff like opening new retail stores on
Boxing Day and on Black Friday
more than once during my tenure there in
fact my first day at NCIX was Boxing Day
which for the uninitiated is Canadian
Black Friday yeah pretty much
it's Chris the day after Christmas the
idea is everyone goes and blows their
Christmas money pretty much so it was
Boxing Day and it was the grand opening
of the Langley store that was my first
day what year was that Wow a long time
ago oh boy so I was like second year
university so I was like
19 or 20 so it was like 12 years ago or
something like that so like 2006 yeah
2006 that was like when Langley was just
starting to boom yeah yeah last time
yeah okay yeah what's okay what's your
guy's actually you know what
why don't we actually start with
everyone's favorite like Boxing Day or
Black Friday will count them both the
same cuz they're basically the same up
here now yep what's your favorite like
boxing their Black Friday story and it
could be something really great like a
great deal you score it or gonna be
something really terrible it doesn't
matter if you guys don't know yet I can
go first do you need time to think
yeah go ahead I have no idea okay so the
last time I like really went Boxing Day
shopping I was still in high school I
was probably in grade 11 or something
like that so I would've been seventeen
and I ended up going to two places so
first I got up at like 5:30 in the
morning so I could get down to future
shop yeah clearly gone oh yeah yeah it's
done so that was the Canadian kind of
Best Buy equivalent back then they got
acquired by Best Buy and then eventually
just dissolved um so I went to future
shop for like 6:00 in the morning and I
scored me some pretty most excellent
stuff the funny thing though is that the
only thing I remember buying was
actually a DVD writer which was kind of
a big deal back then it was it a CD
writer crap I think the point was it was
an optical disc writer and then later
that day I went to NCIX
and I waited in line for like two hours
to buy it one monitor and this was like
where you were convinced yet yes before
I worked there so it was a 17 inch sink
master Samsung and it was for like $2.99
or something 17-inch 1280 by 1024 and I
got it now that was like a great price
anyway it was an LCD though LCD man LCD
so but but the one that really has stuck
with me the most I actually forgot about
the monitor until I remembered the
optical drive
the BenQ optical drive that they had
literally a pyramid of on the floor of
the future shop like this entire like
palette sized pyramid and the cool thing
about that deal was that it was like $50
but with like a $45 mail-in rebate so it
was a $5 optical drive and it was a
writer of whatever was like the cool
thing man whether it was CDs and DVDs I
actually can't quite remember and then
the thing that stuck with me most about
that story is it was over a year later
by the time I finally opened the thing
yeah it was DOA so it was out of
warranty DOA and I never got around to
bailing in the mail-in rebate and that
was the moment that I decided I wasn't
gonna Black Friday or Boxing Day shop
anymore because I was like you know what
the amount of money I wasted on this
thing I obviously didn't need I could
have just not waited around for two
hours bought that monitor at regular
price and come out ahead with a CD
writer you didn't need but yes exactly I
think like mine isn't that great but
basically we went Black Friday shopping
in the States who went down to I think
it's Bella's Fair Mall which is like
near Seattle ish yeah when you know
spend a couple hundred bucks you bought
some clothes bought some shoes whatever
we're coming back up the border and
they're like they seem oddly suspicious
of us I guess it's kind of weird because
all my family seems to have different
last names because of all this crazy
crap that happened sure anyways so they
always try to find this super suspicious
every time we go to the airport
everybody's getting secondary like
typical we're like drug mules totally
yeah so we get pulled into secondary and
we had declared the value of the stuff
we bought it's like 500 bucks or
something because it was like roughly
five hundred dollars maybe a and then
we're all Nexus so when you have Nexus
which is like a they have to travel yeah
they breathe vet you so you can get
through the border at airports and stuff
faster and a lot of the time you don't
get secondary inspection but I guess
that doesn't apply to me so we're going
over the border we get pulled in the
secondary they're like you have 600 and
like four dollars or something it
exactly so my brother who is the one
driving declared the value and he got
his Nexus taken away for six years why
he still doesn't have it yeah and
they'll be like super hardship ever
reapplies because it was a hundred bucks
off Wow yeah all right Friday Boxing Day
story
yeah actually Boxing Day so mine's a
Future Shop story Oh
back in st. John's the one future shop
we had what oh okay okay anyway so got
up really early that's obviously yeah my
mom's boyfriend at the time he was
paraplegic and like people were wrapped
up around the store but because he was
paraplegic he actually like cut his line
and nobody cared okay so we we got in
and I bought a ps2 one of like 10 for
Half Price and came on the game
Need for Speed hot pursuit to I think
and yeah that was that's my most
memorable I think I've only ever gone
like once or twice after that yeah not
bad yeah it's not bad I was back in like
2002 alright yeah we made your story a
lot more exciting than it was I think my
story the presentation that's great but
I bought a CD writer I didn't use this
now I'm gonna save $45 and I didn't I
wasted my money
uh-huh Naomi mail-in rebates man mail-in
rebates
dollars for a box of rocks yeah all
right so tell you what why don't we how
do you how do you guys want to start
with this I I don't know I got PC part
picker open pc part picker that's
cheating on prices here have Anthony be
like the spreadsheet King but I guess I
can make spreadsheets don't think it has
excelled literally doesn't lordy all
right okay do you want to join a screen
share me for now yeah sure
all right so why don't we have a look at
you guys
see Black Friday deals are you on every
dark hello comm I'm doctor yeah so guys
we're gonna be doing American Black
Friday because it's Black Friday its
American holiday holiday know it's kind
of a holiday at this point I don't know
we do have some super chat I mean yes
but later okay so first let's let's
start by going into computers I guess
computers and accessories here now one
of the obstacles seem not that great is
maybe you just weren't shopping for that
yeah whereas if you are shopping for a
computer if you have a mission you
should be able to save a significant
amount of money right you would think so
at least a lot of companies do free
shipping which is really great if they
don't previously do that I really don't
like the way that Amazon presents this
look at this deal of the day 1649 to 449
picture of a monitor save up to 20% on
select a see what happens if you open it
let's let's find that out shall we
what is a 6 48 at 1649 Monitor late ok
so there's it looks like there's some
good deals there like there's some good
deals but it's still kind of misleading
how are these all the deal of the day
it's like does anyone else feel like
we've kind of lost the meaning of some
of the like sales like you know
furniture stores right where you where
they'll have a sign in front of the
store that is quite literally like
yellowed with age this is going out of
business sale sale sale everything must
go it's like you've had that sign up for
six years I have 50% off oh wow that's
what everyone's after around here credit
card yesterday Kylie took you anyways
they had a sign that said 50% off breaks
and pads or whatever and it's been up
there I think literally for 15 years you
can even see where they like changed it
you know and they like paint over and
then like write it with a sharpie or
what let's grab some good let's grab
some good deals here um I would actually
say that this thread Ripper motherboard
is a fantastic deal at 210 yeah is there
cheaper than yeah I mean that's feature
set of it let's find out but 90 bucks
off thread refer motherboard
day-in day-out this isn't one of those
cases where they jacked up the price and
then they went and you know pretended to
slash it for Black Friday that is a good
deal yeah that's a prime board to sell
x3 99 eh yeah that is actually regular
$300 as far as I'm aware okay so I'm
super into that Bluff not great things
about x4 seventy boards like they're
basically the what does it be 450 is the
is the lower end before foot to use the
lower end yeah yeah I end up paying too
much for really features that I think
aren't that PCI issues and stuff like
that okay alright so I'm I'm pretty I'm
pretty into that thread Ripper board
right now um do you guys are we gonna
try and do a monitor or should we even
bother me a way I mean this one's
interesting just because it's 1440p 75
Hertz and it's rated for that out of the
box sooner bucks isn't too bad I'm sure
you can get a better deal than that
honestly though James and I shot a video
literally yesterday about a 179 or 189
4k monitor it's 4k 60 we didn't manage
to overclock it but people on reddit
have reported getting in his hi panel
there were a couple dead pixels producer
you might want to go fullscreen when
we're kind of just yeah there were a
couple of dead pixels but 4k 27-inch
dead pixels are honestly not that
noticeable
oh yeah 4k I was like yeah a couple dead
pixels will be cata crap it was a
separate word right here's a 41 44 Hertz
curved 1920 by 1080 that's also 79 yeah
I just am NOT into 1080 anymore I just
wanna do it when I can have for the same
price when I can have 27-inch not gonna
see anything else here that kind of
stands out too because I honestly QR my
only issue with this monitor is that it
is a TN panel it's 165 Hertz 1440p so if
you were in the market for one just idly
shopping is gonna be like yay this
monitor I wasn't expecting to buy I'm
gonna impulse buy a four hundred and
fifty dollar monitor yeah impulse buy a
165 Hertz monitor either like I mean
yeah 165 Hertz why seems like something
you'd be saving up for and then maybe
you know pull the trigger on okay but we
found out we found a motherboard yeah we
got a motherboard okay I I did hear that
there are some deals on Red River CPUs
specifically first gen
18:50 X that sounds oh yeah 569 569 yep
whoa fire over a fire over to Anthony
here yep
whoa hold on a second that's a great
deal yeah that's wait no there's better
there's better new egg new york new egg
even better like not that's like a
really better I want I'm gonna I'm gonna
check out and see if I can find some
video card deals here in the meantime go
you guys fire that up cuz I mean that's
really where we want to start now that
we've kind of settled on thread Ripper
oh wow yeah it is even better 49 that's
really good that's killer so for what
210 plus 450 is 660 yeah holy smokes 660
gets you a 16 core CPU and motherboard
combo yeah that is not bad at all
there's one thing this is kind of
unrelated but I got a message about this
one there's some really good deals on
mesh Wi-Fi routers specifically the
tp-link ones okay they're 150 bucks for
three that's pretty cheap that's like
what you would pay for one router
honestly though I mean if it was Jake
right what oh my gosh honestly though if
I was doing a mesh Wi-Fi setup yeah I
would probably not necessarily go mesh
right away mm-hmm and I would just buy
an Asus Wi-Fi router and then I would
just expand it yeah because they've got
that whole thing where you can put their
routers in just mesh mode and they
support ones that are as well just like
three or four years old yeah trains list
old routers and expand your mesh it's
not quite as good as it if it doesn't
have the dedicated backbone for it
though okay fair enough but the newer
ones so if you grab the new Murray ones
then they do have the dedicated backhaul
yeah because it's always a separate band
for them
I would make the argument though that on
the outer limits of your mesh
you're probably like this is you're
probably setting up a mesh set up for
our reason yeah so you're probably gonna
just use 2.4 gigahertz for your actual
client connectivity anyway yeah so I
don't know I'm not convinced it's a huge
deal okay well let's get back to okay so
we've got motherboard the CPU mm-hmm
okay is there going to be Ram deals uh
maybe I really don't know
haven't D Ram been oversupply for a
while Wow hold on a second I don't know
if this is like the best deal but fire
over to my screen I am liking this VGA
that's g3 750 watt for a hundred or if
excuse me for $60 we might even have
better you know they announced their
Black Friday sales which are always
ridiculous
they have like a 1200 watt that I think
is $100 us which is absurd okay that's
pretty interesting let's go to their
main page buy one get one Black Friday
promotion what are they drawn here we go
500 watt power supply for 20 bucks what
hold on us which one is that that's 103
that's still their bronze units have
problems okay all right wait they have a
store like on their site right now what
do you got what else you got oh there's
left stuff okay they're all see price
and cart I want to get this they send
out an email cuz honestly I would take I
would take the $500 750 watt over a bit
remember we're building a thread refer
back on your rig right yeah yes we're
gonna throw a BP card in there too yeah
so that's looking like them the top
candidate for me so far but I mean
graphics card EVGA is probably not a
terrible bet home man it's also gold
efficiency GT yeah exactly exactly a
little bit oh man see pricing car you
guys
mmm that is so annoying 80 bucks for a
thousand won that's that's pretty damn
good I paid a hundred bucks for a
thousand watt and I was like I know but
we don't we don't need a thousand this
is true we don't although with those 16
cores you know we got some room for
expansion in the future if you wanted to
run virtualization or something you
might want a second card okay that's
fair so a thousand bucks okay so here if
you're doing this yourself which you're
probably
not but if you are you know if you need
the thousand watt go for the thousand
other way otherwise you're still only
changing your price by like 20 bucks I
mean I like either of those deals quite
frankly yeah um so they've got a couple
rx 270 deals but they're really nothing
that special like 40 bucks off here 50
bucks off and I think both of them
actually so if you were gonna go for an
RT X 2070 I guess but the problem is
that as long as as long as GT X 1080 T
eyes can still be found in the wild I
don't think they're gonna be that
compelling with that set I know that
production has stopped oh yeah
so let's see if there's anything one
thing I found on Newegg 1070 t eyes are
on sale for about the same yes ten
here's the thing that I heard apparently
after the whole mining shebang 1070 went
shebang we're really we're a really
popular card for mining and there are 10
70s all over a Bay for like dirt cheap
like - 300 bucks us and I guess that's
maybe not are you bringing up you Bay
they're bringing up baby I mean not
everyone's gonna necessarily be
comfortable buying used stuff especially
if it's been used for mining yep I mean
baby is having a Black Friday sale yes
Black Friday deals huge Black Friday -
how does that work I guess there's some
legit people that sell on eBay
well yeah but how does he pay like
control this I don't know like wait a
minute this is a core i7 7700 with the
GTX 1074 970 hmm now hold on just a
gosh-darn it's got 16 gigs around SSD
yeah that's that's more than the sum of
its parts right there said if we just
dude we just end the stream now what
crap bye guys the answer the answer was
the answer is always a bit wait wait
wait what about the top right there
that's a 8700 del with a 1017 terabyte
hard drive 256 gig gave says although
this it's del furbish that's still
though yeah is it certified for further
so you still get a warranty a grade a
condition one year dell warranty yeah
okay this as good as new
are we allowed to swear
the stream cuz this is little you like
what okay the power supply sucks
well yeah it's going to be it's gonna be
a Dell you're gonna open it up and it's
gonna be like you don't even want to
touch it but it will work and you do get
a warranty but this has a six core
processor in it and a gtx 1070 yeah
and that probably i power supply it's
wattage does suck but it's probably
thought about the asus one does it have
a crap power spy - ah
asus from my experience with their pre
builds it tends to be a little better
this is also referred by the way guys
okay okay we can have a look here and
see if they actually spec it out but
i've been just that that's 16 gigs of
ram power about 500 watt I don't say
what so like I said a little better yeah
but it's still a prebuilt they're not
gonna overdo it yeah
okay you know what let's just let's
finish our let's finish our new build
for build okay then we'll find the best
rebuild back to the best rebuild on eBay
or whatever um so graphics cards I'm
checking out new egg and I didn't see
anything come up for my search result
tens 1080 there's no nevermind here we
go so that's a 1080 oh we did we didn't
even look at the 1070 deal on eBay right
okay so we should probably quickly bring
that up so 1070 here's one for 220 230
227 that's like really cheap that's
really cheap but not everyone is
comfortable buying used and I want to
make sure that we're covering our so if
you're buying new new eggs got this 1080
for 439 from ZOTAC I sure wish that I
could sort by category a little bit more
easily here this is kind of annoying me
oh no here we go
yeah it is over here components video
cards and video devices there we go
beautiful can you sort by money now
so we've got our TX 28 ESR so uh what's
the word I'm looking for in expense over
price yeah there you go
ridiculous and the the real issue here
is that anyway hold up I got a better
word for it there lit thank you because
they said on fire oh that's not cool the
real issue here is not that literally
not cool it's not that
okay I am oh man okay sorry continues
real issue here is not that RTX is a bad
technology yeah and it's not that the
r-tx mm series cards are crappy cards
that aren't fast yeah the issue here is
that anything other than the r-tx 2080
TI which is where most people from what
i've seen are showcasing like
battlefield 5 RT x on performance and
even then it's not great yeah that's
right even that's not great yeah so if
you're buying an RT x 2070 you are
buying into this technology at the
lowest possible tier when we already
know that even the first generation
games don't run great on the highest
tier so that's where the justification
for going latest gen over something like
10 series really melts away to me
especially with the price you can get on
like a use 1080i a 2080 just doesn't
make and what's really interesting too
is that a lot of the time you can make
the argument for buying the latest gen
product because you know it's gonna get
software support for longer nvidia like
but not just that the other thing to
consider is how large the installed user
base is for that product yeah so with
with with a generation like in videos
400 series which wasn't particularly
popular didn't perform particularly well
and it was replaced in like 8 months 9
months something like that yeah you can
expect that the long-term support for
like a GTX 480 is not going to be as
good as the long-term support for
something like 900 or 10 series yeah
because those lasted for so long like
they have such a large customer base
that they can justify supporting over
time and right now so we're still
supported
yeah newest driver down to 600 series
exactly what is 600 series Kat's Kepler
yeah so that's a long time really old so
that was back when you were really
impressed when you got 1080p 60 and now
you get 1080p 60 it's like
and then you turn our TX on in this
cinematic hot back over to me for a
second here and let's have a look what's
out there like honestly to me it looks
like these are just token discounts
because no one really wants to give away
these r-tx cards because whatever we
might think about them my understanding
is they're selling pretty well yeah I
wouldn't buy a Vegas 64 treat oh there's
no snow we're just keeping this in our
head is there shape I wouldn't buy a
Nega 64 even for 400 bucks quickly
hahaha
we might need a bigger power supply 400
but would you buy it for 400 bucks no
there's probably a lot for sale on eBay
and look at this thing it's a reference
design to be hot no it might not burst
into flame but it might make something
else like it's it's not like that either
I mean don't be a drama queen but like
the thing is that oh man and I know I
know I already said not everyone is
comfortable buying used but in a world
where GTX 10 70s for 230 bucks on eBay
exists or if you're going for even like
a lower buck build like a five seventy
or five eighty four eighty those kind of
cards and AMD not Nvidia they're dirt
cheap like 100 bucks for a five seventy
which is like I mean sure it's probably
been used for mining but when you're
mining you're under volting and it's
probably only drawing like 80 watts so
the big concern there is normally like
the fan dying you're assuming they're
mining sort of correctly yeah this is
true but the kind of people that are
selling hundreds of them you would
imagine are probably doing it somewhat
right you would imagine I don't know
I've met some Yahoo's in the mining
community tell me this do you go for the
10 80 amp 4 for 40 or do you do the 1070
TI for 349 I would do the 1070 TI
because I mean honestly the nice cooler
you know we're going thread Ripper so if
we're honest with ourselves this is not
a gaming first build mm-hmm so we might
have you know liquid nitrogen cooling
yeah maybe so we've got a 1070 TI which
is a very very respectable gaming card
and also you know great CUDA performance
for whatever other kinds of workloads we
want to throw it I think that
the balanced so which came out it was
retaining there was a ZOTAC one for
shoot what did I say 1070 TI 1070 TI is
ZOTAC oh right there there's one right
there was this one this guy right most
of the mini 49 yeah so that's still a
solid cooling yep it's gonna it's gonna
be a weird kind of looking machine giant
socket yeah the graphics card is smaller
than the CPU but look we are building a
good deal we are not building the best
looking machine yeah it's true hey
here's another thing not even sponsored
cable mod right now if we want to do
custom cables you can get a cable mudkip
yeah that's it deep box that's true it's
50% oh that's a really good deal yeah
like they're normally a hundred plus and
if you want custom cables it's crazy but
it's gonna bring it up here so which GP
are we going with I think we're gonna go
with that 1078 1070 TI mini for 350 I
mean if you guys object like there's
some good rx5 actually this is
interesting as rock looks has a
desperate heir to them their phantom
arms my 70 is a hundred and forty bucks
with two games that's a new - that's a
good value that's a great value I know
yeah thread Ripper no there's those
cables I was talking about here that's
stupid
so we can make our system look somewhat
okay I guess
well depends on what power supply we go
with I'm not gonna put the cable mod
ones in it for doing like a pure bang
for the buck that's more like an impulse
buy a Black Friday that's a good impulse
buy though yeah yeah it's like 50 bucks
how desperate does this look I still
remember back when I was working at NCIX
we'd be doing like our Black Friday or
our Boxing Day like deal meeting and
you'd always have that product manager
that would come into the meeting with
this like yeah we're gonna do $400 off
and then you kind of have to you kind of
have to sit them down and go look even
at $400 off which one are we looking at
the colorful g-force eye game 1080 TI
neptune water-cooled cards oh my god is
not a good deal anymore
sorry you are gonna have to just take
the hit on your P&amp;amp;L sheet and you are
gonna have to slash that thing yeah that
was a bad buy dude we got somebody
saying they're sorry with a super chat
there is that good by 2080 gaming OC for
750 that's not too bad but it's still
yeah yeah you're gonna get like 45 FPS
you can get that for happy X yeah I'm
sorry did they say $700 749 okay so
honestly I mean it's not yeah I mean you
could probably get to today's 1080i a
exactly you could get exactly to 1080
TSI maybe but I'm recommending a salon
ever since SLI cost me scrap yard worse
that one time I have not forgiven it and
I don't intend to
but from an FPS per dollar perspective
bearing in mind that this thread Ripper
rig is not a pure gaming box
I like the 1070 TI better yep it's a
good point though it's a good point it
does look like 1050 or 1080 T is are not
you know on clearance right now yeah did
they even have stock
Oh does not appear that way they're just
they're just gone they're just gone
alright well I mean that's good to know
what happened to the like crazy
overstock of cards well I think the
crazy overstock of cards was all on the
stuff that was more popular with minors
so 1063 games 1066 games and I think but
don't quote me on this I don't have any
any insight into the inner workings of
Nvidia quite frankly but I think that's
probably why we haven't seen the RT X
2060 or GTX depending with fans are
calling it come like a 2060 or 2050
because they need to get rid of all that
last gen inventory yep I don't think the
high-end was ever really the issue okay
should we see if we can get a RAM deal
yeah I've got a deal on an SSD okay
there's lots of those deals okay well
here we can put this down as a
placeholder though because that's
looking pretty good
what's one terabyte eight sixteen I paid
like 350 Canadian and you probably felt
pretty good about it ya know for a 500
gig yeah a couple years ago so this
works out even with the Canadian dollar
in the toilet this still works out to
like 170
yeah that's really so yeah up okay let's
put that down as a placeholder and let's
start looking for a round deal here ddr4
like can I just search Amazon like this
oh man so we need a quad channel kit
though if we've like want to do it
properly or not yeah yeah or two dual
channel you know what though the thing
with buying two dual channel kids is a
lot of the times either you run into
straight-up compatibility issues where
it won't post properly without hitting
the Ripper right yeah the other issue is
that even once you do have it running a
lot of the times there is a reason that
the manufacturer advertises this is
skylake X optimized yeah this is so do
we need Flair X or something I think
that might not be a terrible idea
because the sub timings will be tuned
for the particular platform the
manufacturer expects it to be run on
especially if you want to run an XMP or
do CP or whatever AMD calls their XMP
equivalent profile Newegg is calling
this a sale I don't think it's a sales a
hundred and eighty bucks for weight but
it doesn't even say that there's a
discount no just as there's a sale well
hold on a second though I mean is that
wait that's 16 gigs that's not that's
not a deal at all yeah like here's
Amazon's pick for their ddr4 deal yeah
vengeance lpx to buy a gig for 130 bucks
that's 3000 but yeah Hertz isn't gonna
kill you yeah exactly and you can
probably overclock it 200 megahertz if
you're really into that so yeah we need
to go for DP you don't I don't know
this build is really not about the
aesthetic at this point with Ben 72 you
guys we could spend the extra and get a
bigger card current you know it's not
what I would do like if it was if this
was me 10 years ago Black Friday
shopping I would buy the cheapest FPS
per dollar yeah I'm not really that into
any of these memory deals generously on
anyway well on Newegg there's quadrant
seems like it's pretty expensive
doesn't like Best Buy do compute
components now they do I walked in there
one time I think they had a GT 1030 and
a 1050 ahead what the heck is P and why
anarchy oh wow
I mean it's not actually a terrible
price it looks terrible I know doesn't
it what is that I can't tell which one
looks worse the red one or the blue one
there bit like I'm the top the blue
probably looks better holy crap is Best
Buy's vengeance lpx deal oh no it's
slower it's slower nevermind
I thought Best Buy's vengeance lpx deal
hope you're ready Ram hold up holy is it
VR ready
wait go down go down you're ready Ram
hold on a second I think Best Buy's Ram
deal is $10 better than Amazon it is it
is this is this is ddr4 3000 it's too
bad Amazon's wasn't better than best buy
because Best Buy I'll beat the price
yeah that's true and they've got 3,200
for 129
yeah and that's via already did you know
what the thing with Corsair is I wait
wait is this vengeance led for 114 no
but they have led 3000 for 124 yeah let
me get the LEDs yeah we're doing the
LEDs yeah Oh got it
72 gaining to two packs of that for now
so what okay so I'll just gotta pass by
one sign here yes too bad we don't have
like some kind of way to communicate I
could I'm technically Luke right now you
take LM GGG okay okay what do we need
next huh so we got a graphics card we
got a seat we need a cooler that thing
yeah we really need a true
we need a beefy cooler the good thing is
that like the cooler manufacturers tend
to be pretty desperate around these
kinds of promotions so I wouldn't be
surprised if we can find a cooler for
like we're going for a triple a few
bucks I would personally go with Noctua
but okay yeah Knoxville won't discount
Bowery ice I search for water cooler
this is the problem with Amazon though
you can't find anything like dang it Oh
like how do you find okay forget it
oh you make just new a just earned my
business by having a website that's not
impossible to navigate you're gonna
watch you search up water-cooler on new
egg no gives you the same here it is you
know if it was enter yes probably be a
notable water cooler boom water liquid
cooling so deep cool apparently got
pretty desperate yeah coolermaster has
this one for 49 bucks after me and after
an mir I don't know how Coolermaster
handles thread Ripper compatibility I
know Corsair ships you a thing Mac's
right there Corsair really charges a lot
for their a iOS yeah but they're good I
know but H Adi I wouldn't pay 75 bucks
for it
yeah not what you can get this dual
radiator one or this dual 120 460 like
there's just no way what about that
enter max one um the lichte yeah 360
here yeah AMD socket Tier four that's a
hundred and forty dollars that's not a
Black Friday triple no I know that's
only that's literally 20 bucks off and
it does have a fifteen dollar rebate but
I'm not down there are some deals on
knock to a stuff on new egg but not for
Tier four so I guess I mean right of
course this one is frankly more
interesting to me like if you're gonna
spend 150 bucks this is slightly cooler
why don't you spend 150 bucks and get
legitimately custom level performance
that you can expand that flute gaming
yeah remember this is aluminum so you're
gonna have limited upgrade options but
still I would take that over like a
completely closed loop cool and be sold
here you go there's the answer now I'm
gonna
oh wait what's this yeah 140 from EVGA
for 99 bucks h 100 i on amazon for 75 oh
that's pretty good too and I know that
Corsair handles TR for compatibility
reasonably well right like don't they
send you a bracket if it doesn't have it
I think you're gonna be like like a 240
on thread Ripper is you think
I think oh you're not gonna be able to
overclock and the EVGA does include the
a.m. wait am for no no but I don't know
if it has FM for tier 4 or tier 4 sorry
Bambi's had a lot of sockets ok ok
until sockets are all the same okay yeah
you know what I don't actually see any
reference to tr4 on at least the Newegg
page for this and that there in the
background there hidden ok
there's some stuff in the background
we're gonna talk about it later
yeah everybody everybody chill why
doesn't why doesn t be EVGA calm come up
when you search for this stupid cooler I
can't even like finally yo there it is
why do I have to specifically search for
that okay bad SEO here we go ok yeah ok
ok let's do it let's do the EVGA 280
those fans ok what's situated oh I don't
know I don't know if it's good they just
look cool
yeah ok especially with some $99 right
oh yeah 99 bucks for that EVGA that's
that's off newegg.com like ok with those
new Noctua fans that have this super
small gap between the housing you would
think that a design like that would be
bad for airflow but anyways okay see how
hardcore do we go on our case like do we
go for like a core p1 and put our little
tiny IV bucks we dick graphics card on
display or less we could buy a milk
crate ok I don't wanna do that either
I think the p9 490 was it 75 bucks 90
bucks
that's pretty good for a temper glass
case yeah especially like a modular one
I don't like the look of it personally
as much as the crystal 517 but then
that's 100 everybody has alright what
about just something clean then you go
to some our our board is is a TA TX mmm
it's like slightly wider oh so it's like
ATX but it probably won't fit in a lot
of cases like the like the define series
has
that curved portion yes or they're not
the curb but the slanted portion that
comes FSP make cases I don't know that
looks pretty cool it seems fine as long
as the yeah board compatibility looks
fine like you'll have a little bit less
room for cable management but it'll
probably go to about here the only thing
with like the budget case is you tend to
have some issues with actually huh
Oh should we check out new egg - I'm on
new I hear there's some corsair carbide
stuff like the speckled live i take
their spec lineup I've told them this to
their face so I don't even I don't even
okay about 275 are for 60 bucks yeah I'm
more into that honestly none of these
case deals are particular should we
check yeah you can check Corsairs
website for now but in the meantime
Anthony what do you got
you know what that master box looks not
bad doesn't saves pretty Edgeley is oh
it's MITx
hey remember this thing the 1000d did
you see that they took the curved glass
off the front I didn't yeah yeah so
we're the only ones so there's only two
jay has one two units in existence that
have the curved glass right yeah I'm
sending our NZXT h 509
I don't know do you just want to go for
something super clean like this deep
cool thing I mean it's 28 I don't know
it feels kind of stupid here we go of
course their deals spending 600 bucks on
your motherboard and there's a lot of
DIY PC stuff in here so it's kinda never
good oh it's just um new eggs house
brand I think is it like weird brand
I don't remember DIY PC is like
someone's weird lighthouse brand hmm
what about that 500 I just 500 something
it's actually probably better to school
Lakers cuz it'll look a little bit
smooth no I didn't even realize there
was a touch green yeah there's a touch
screen in here you know what the spec Oh
2 is not as bad
okay well we're building up a system
with a 500 dollar CPU fine you 75 are
then we can get a decent case so 275 are
yeah it's tough is it gonna fit it's 49
bucks on Amazon okay let's go for the
black one can you open up okay yeah it's
all gonna Chooch is the expert I'm a VIP
X board it looks like it should be fine
there's enough room next to the cable
management here I don't know I don't
know man that look at where the screws
are that yeah that'll be fine
like we don't know but it's slanted
though I have this exact problem it
might define our for this one no that
does not oh wait I know it is I think
it's fine yeah you like you might
actually end up having something up the
board just paint a little bit of nail
polish on the you know the case or
whatever to make sure it doesn't short
like I've done things like that before
but I think this will fit bring up the
motherboard you can bring up the
motherboard you can see how light it is
this is totally the wrong board oops
yeah x3 99 prime - H 700 Pub G Wow you
got it yeah can I just get a flat shot
off dude no I don't know the screws are
are really far over it's quite a bit
bigger I was like a whole inch to the
right of the screws that's like EA T X
but 98 yeah it's no - you jerks but it
basically is I think we should only wide
yeah I think we gotta go with a
different case fine I was really happy
this one also had support for our hard
okay what about okay let's go back what
about that NZXT H 500 I this one also
has a stupid thing next to it no you can
take the stupid thing off
can you well actually it does kind of
look like there's probably enough room
there yeah look at those screws oh yeah
there's okay finds everything H 500 I
it's 80 blocks though what about the
white one one new egg
Oh H 500 I I'm pretty sure it's not 80
bucks ctrl F H 500 I'm good to say four
it's more 509 I was the
the iron that the frankly I have no idea
but that one's not a tempered glass
panel okay should be oh let's just put
that one down whatever okay fine listen
so we got our storage deal what else
what else do we need is that the storage
deal look pretty good to me do you want
if I'm try and find another storage deal
good one a hard drive nvme maybe nvm
he's not really a big deal so we got our
CPU and then I got girls right here we
got our so actually we are CPU we got
our motherboard yeah Ram GPU power
supply SSD we got our cooler we got our
case what are we missing
Windows Windows kidding okay but like it
is on sale is it really yeah it's always
on sale during promotions yes with this
coupon that's the best coupon look I'm
just saying it's on sale okay 69 cents
baby wait little spammy so it's probably
something not great okay she's gonna
pretend like that's not happening okay
okay cooler case I do wanna go back to
the white spot eh 500 has some case fans
right because there are Noctua fans on
sale yeah but I probably wouldn't buy
Noctua fans if I'm going straight bang
for the buck like a fan as a fan as a
fan it moves air like it's when you're
starting to get into a highly optimized
silent build that you start to get into
yes you need to start looking at not too
advanced yeah I mean I find be quiet
that's pretty good too we have a lot of
super chats that I should probably look
at a few of them yeah um you know
Jenkins says my dad still tickles me I'm
19 is that weird yeah yeah I plan to
tickle my kids when they're 19 so that
doesn't exactly like a normal person
thank you beautiful all hail the king of
macros Ricky did you see the RX 574 170
we found a way better deal on an RX 570
thank you though
Thank You Mitchell the new re TX cards
worth the jump I think we discussed that
yeah we didn't see your comment but we
definitely covered that Keegan says
build a PC for 500 bucks what parts do
you recommend okay sorry I can't really
do that anymore because the number of
people that email me asking for parts
recommendations is just untenable but we
have a new builds section of the LTTE
forum where our community is actually
super active so that's the that's the
way to go
tom says are those bananas real
absolutely I'm gonna eat one right now
tom says Riley Berg's dead Matt says
Linus of the Caribbean I love your work
dark says I thought you were a
philippine cooperate yes we are we are
we all are harrison love surya anthony
sort of this mean you live here now
thank you yeah GPA yeah GPA okay we call
it the gb rd okay yuri your cover up
your eastern is showing okay well we'll
probably i mean we've only got a couple
more things to do actually and i think
we're good
two terabyte sshd 480 bucks data says
the steam is like or the stream is
lagging for a lot of people also the
Cabos on sale it's 40% off apparently
that's it yeah that's a pretty good deal
just as like an HDMI switcher quite
frankly hmm
tom says marry me - and then there's an
eggplant and a ring polygamy's not legal
Jakob says 20% Amazon warehouse deals
I thought 165 Hertz issues okay I'm at
bones says threader for deal build I
mean my heart Linus yes we did do that
uh Benito says eBay loses the money and
sellers get the full amount that's what
I was led to believe yeah no way yeah
I'm pretty sure they do a loss leader on
it Ryan says what's happening and why
love the channel guys I don't know what
this is but damn it I love it that
describes most of it to be easier if you
see parts thanks right I mean there's
some killer deals on the 8 terabytes I
saw like to fire a mom or super chats
while you guys track down some deals
that's nice nearer to neurotics says 28
et eyes are $1,500 right now fire
by one by two you guys me Ram we didn't
really find any amazing rails for sir we
also weren't looking in Canada so like
you could always go to Mexico yeah I
would probably do that seems like
Coursera lpx was on sale that was the
best deal I don't know what it's like in
Canada but in the state yeah
Coursera seems to be hitting it pretty
hard so go for it okay see gates
expansion a terabyte for 129 ma'am yeah
so see you get expansion a terabyte for
129 that's hair Coleman Coleman
get over here it's probably slow but
like I mean it's an external screen
share me for a sec yeah I guess
okay Colton come on there's some a data
RGB 2 by 8 gig ddr4 3200 are the AMD are
Intel like recent like Rison yeah ok
then then go go with this it's RGB it's
180 Canadian that's not bad a data ok hi
hi megahertz yep yeah the 3288 oh one ok
yeah just go to their front page take a
component sale all right there you go ok
so back to Anthony we got 8 terabyte for
180 bucks burning oh that's that's only
5400 rpm that's what if you got a couple
and you put them in blood that's fine
yeah and like worst case it's narrow
we're not on Intel so we can't
necessarily count on just using Smart
Response or whatever they call their SSD
caching you know cash you could use
primo cash but doesn't primo cash paid
yeah remember that affects the budget of
our system but like ok mind worst-case
scenario you buy cheap SSD on Craigslist
or you just buy a slightly more
expensive hard drive like did we even
scroll down here these are slightly more
expensive hard drive even a much better
experience frankly I don't know loading
games because remember you only install
them once well we have a one terabyte
SSD yeah so then exactly ok no yes
you buy the cheap hard drive you buy
primo cache you partition your SSD and
you cash your drive or maybe get two
SSDs because how much is cash
okay that's not necessarily an option
for everyone michael says I recently
bought a Vega 64 tire Khalil for 330
bucks it works great and I want a liquid
cooling okay does it work great with
real nose
that's ramdisk no it's not they're
rounded there we go that's all my sees
30 bucks yeah so for 30 bucks I say yeah
get the Johar Drive in primo cash it
already yeah okay so Michael Michael am
I going
I wouldn't water cool anything other
than a top-of-the-line video card and
even though the Vegas 64 is at the top
of Andy's stack it is not a
top-of-the-line video card unfortunately
if you water pool anything other than a
top-of-the-line video card all you're
creating for yourself is a headache when
it's time to flip it maybe buy a 1080i
instead of a 2080 and use the money you
saved no no no a lot of Vegas 65 that's
unfortunate for three hundred and thirty
bucks like it's a mess not bad it's a
deal I still could have had almost a
1080i okay dobrica says would a gigabyte
a horas gaming box 1074 a $4.99 be a
good deal would it be overkill for a
4700 n Q at 16 gigs run no that's a
great that's a great deal yeah that's
their little external box for 500 bucks
for a 1070 in an enclosure that does
power delivery too doesn't it I'm not
sure about that one I actually don't
know if that one does okay because I
thought that like it like it charges
your laptop I think the 1081 did has not
all laptops have like actually this one
is a perfect example this one only has
one type C no MacBooks fine they have
this one has one type C which is it's
only power input so if you use an
external thunderbolt dock that doesn't
do power delivery then you're just boom
you can only use it on pattern we got
Windows Windows lawl you can get it on
Amazon and there's some other places you
can get it why is this you have
top-secret yeah it's fine
so are we in pretty good shape at this
point like I think so like I mean if we
look at it you know we're forgetting
something
while you guys rapid eyes feeling I'm
gonna do what I forgot which is to tell
you guys the sponsor for today's video

yeah I don't know what the heck are you
doing are you gonna change the ISO white
balance
okay so Google sent us a pixel three
there you go oh man the focus is great
pixel three we got a pixel case you get
to Google home minis and the pixel stand
and a code for a pixel my case and we're
gonna be giving this away you want to go
- LM GG g / pixel it's a 64 gig it's the
pixel three not the XL just so you know
not that you're gonna be complaining
because it's a free picture LM GG g /
pixel you can sign up there we're gonna
give it away
next Friday yeah this is so funny alpha
testing says super chat have you guys
tried buying bit
for Black Friday I heard prices were way
down or maybe they're way up
I can't tell Jake asks why not use AMD
store mi for caching because it's awful
yes at least BAM right apparently you
can get a key for primo cash off cowbell
that sounds legit oh wow there's already
800 entries okay that was close it's the
first time we said what 800 entries each
one the subscribe to Linus tech tips
gives you 5 entries oh ok alright so if
anyone wasn't subscribed you know what
we should do here hold on I'm gonna fire
up social blade here and we can see if
we're actually gonna see a spike in
subscribers right now because they do
the count ok so what you got to do is to
get the pixel 3 is there's a couple
different options one you can subscribe
Linus tech tips that's one you have to
do mandatory Amanda mandatorily wow that
was terrible and you get alive injuries
for that yeah sure go online it's
disagreeing and then two you can last
one Twitter for another school and then
there's our Instagram and Facebook and
Wow
we're gonna get D monetize now whatever
look chapter doesn't matter at this
point there's our awesome basically
somebody who's watching is probably
named Richard
wow we're up to 20,000 entries okay
that's a few more we lost a bunch more
subscribers from calling them dicks okay
what if I say wow people are
unsubscribing Andry subscribing you guys
are such nice people nice people hold on
we got to stem the tide here
oh no what always be Troy you
matchsticks quick get it away get it
away as long as they can watch it go
down they're gonna keep doing it change

never just about done Riley alright so
thanks guys for tuning into our Black
Friday shopping stuff all we do
something free shipping yeah you're good
just a 99 bucks for a 1950 ex nice
motherboard nice power supply 1070 TI
mini which is gonna look really funnier
you could spend another hundred bucks
you could get a Norton eight probably
about what you would think of a person
when they're wearing socks and sandals
Wow yeah yeah I probably just we
probably just lost a bunch more
subscribers it's gonna be like it's
