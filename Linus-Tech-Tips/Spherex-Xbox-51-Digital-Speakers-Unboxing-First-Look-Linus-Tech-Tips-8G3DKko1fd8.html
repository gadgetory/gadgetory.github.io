that is of interest to me and absolutely
nobody else this is the legendary spear
X Xbox 5.1 surround sound system it is
no longer available but as you can see
by the very old and very beat-up box I
managed to find one in our warehouse and
I bought it because I happen to need
some speakers I'm planning to move my
cat speakers that are on my computer
over to my TV and so I needed something
for my computer and since it has a
digital input I can make use of this so
in terms of the overall specs and
features why don't we go over what's on
the front here so we have five omni
polar satellite speakers so these use a
pretty cool technology that actually
only sends some of the sound directly to
your ears the rest of it it bounces so
you actually hear it indirectly off the
walls and off the the obstacles in the
room and the theory and from what I've
heard it works really well is that it
sounds much more natural that way all
right we have a powered eight inch
subwoofer which uses some kind of other
technology to produce sounds that are as
far as your perception goes much lower
frequency than what an eight inch
subwoofer can normally do we have a 300
watt RMS digital six channel amplifier
so like I said digital which means
optical input and I don't believe it
accepts any analog input at all other
than no it does it does it accepts like
RCA cables or something so nothing from
a computer and certainly nothing 5.1 it
has a headphone output which is handy
USB connectivity future expansion
capability yeah I don't think that's
going to be happening based on how I
would have production all of this stuff
is aa remote control and IR receiver
included I'll speaker wearing included
yeah like check this out the warranty is
also penned out on the box awesome so I
don't think I'll be getting any kind of
warranty support on this whatsoever
and here actually here's something else
that's on the outside of the box a
little bit more detail about these
speakers so it creates a much larger
sweet spot rather than having a very
very narrow place where the where the
listening position is optimal so inside
we find a bilingual setup guide the
papers fill white so it's uh it's not
battled I guess you guys should have
seen how gusty this was when I when I
first opened it up all right we've got
speaker cables which I will meet so one
end is terminated in oh these are both
ends are terminated in RCA cables so we
have how many of those five of those so
there's the five cables now they're kind
of thin gauge but reasonably flexible so
should be should be not too bad it looks
like there's two longer ones and then
three shorter ones so that would be for
the front channels from the rear
channels okay
next you've got a packing foam and then
we find the speakers so like I said
these are really old like I think this
is it several years old this inventory
it was so dusty when I found it but they
are in brand-new condition so I will
show you guys one of the satellites I'm
not gonna bother unboxing them all
because they're identical to each other
I just want to show you guys the speaker
design now I don't know you know speaker
engineer but I can try and explain the
basic principles and show you guys sort
of what I meant before so if I could get
it out of the bag I mean okay here we go
so that's the front of the speaker so
you can see there's a here I hope you
can see I think this comes off yeah
there we go okay so that's the front of
the speaker so the way it's designed it
actually reflects the sound off of this
kind of cone shaped dome shaped
thing and it reflects the right amount
of sound directly at you and the rest of
it out to the walls so that
proportionally you hear I think it's
something like 70% directly and 30%
reflected at you by your surroundings
and you can see there's another dome
right there for the tweeter so that's
also reflecting that sound towards you
and also at the wall so actually here
the speaker itself has a nice like if
you don't mind the Xbox branding I've
heard they're just great speakers
although I haven't had a chance to
listen yet so we've got a removable
grill there then just the speaker's
themselves okay on the bottom we've got
screwing for a stand as well as no
wonder what that can be used for hard to
say but there's our connection for the
audio cable all right
so there's one speaker let's see what
else we've got in here in terms of
accessories so actually haven't quite
decided if these ones are going to end
up downstairs or if these ones I learned
that Bob stares and I move the receiver
and Kev speakers downstairs I guess it
depends on how everything sounds what
looks better not sure I bought these on
a recommendation so I'll have to kind of
play around with them myself and see
what I think before I make any decisions
but this looks like some more
accessories and whatnots here we find an
optical audio cable noodles certified
gaming gear okay cool
next we find yes the front control pod
oh okay
doesn't seem to have any controls on it
just is a dislocated display in an
infrared receiver so you actually have
to control these with the remote they
don't have any buttons right on the
front so there you go you can see all
the stuff that says on there there's a
bunch of certifications Dolby Digital
Pro Logic 2 DTS surround Texas
Instruments of all things on the top
here alright you know what I'm going to
turn these lights around something
you guys can actually see what I'm doing
a little better down here there we go
maybe that will help alright next we've
got kind of what looks like kind of an
s-video cable but it's probably some
proprietary thing from the control pot
yeah so that plugs into the full pot and
then presumably the stop and AM next
we've got okay so that's just a coaxial
digital cable which is just like any
other coaxial cable and then we have
this is for using with your computer if
you only want to use to channel sound
I'm guessing a lot Mix 35.1 if you want
to go that route and then finally we
have the Xbox remote you know it's too
bad that products like this are kind of
dying out like stuff that's designed for
gamers but actually delivers excellent
sound quality like we used to have so
many options you know creative flinch
monsoon if you want to go back a little
bit further than that you know you've
got companies like this doing stuff and
now we just have I here's a couple
double-a batteries these are probably
like expired let me see if there's a
expiry date on them but they the cold
hard reality that I've come to face is
that gamers don't know the difference
between good audio and loud audio and
they aren't willing to pay for it so
that's why we see products like this
just go Yoel Razer Mako is another
another great example of just a
phenomenal set of speakers that was
marketed at gamers but actually it was
just a really neat audio set but wasn't
successful because people weren't
willing to pay the premium for something
that's truly well made and sounds really
good in everything not just you know
boom games
so I'm trying to get this sub open
alright the Xbox branding I have to
admit is a bit of a bit of a turn-off
because it's kind of like that so
weird-looking style and it's actually
designed to match the old original Xbox
not an Xbox 360 ok so here we go try to
clear some room here so there's this up
kind of got your standard audio
equipment finish on it ok comes with
these little silver legs that are gonna
lift it up off the ground a little bit
so that as you can see if I tip it a
little bit further the 8-inch subwoofer
down here will have a little bit of room
between itself on the ground
alright I'm gonna turn it around show
you guys in the back ok here we go so
we've got our power switch got a fuse
here ok cool then we've also got the
infrared receiver in USB in I don't
think this does anything I think it was
one of those for future expansion things
but this product disappeared sound
clearly there was no future for it then
we've got speakers only so this plugs
into all of our speakers front left
right surround left right and center
then we've got optical in up to two
sources coaxial in as well as left and
right analog in that we've got a power
plug and that's about it so thank you
