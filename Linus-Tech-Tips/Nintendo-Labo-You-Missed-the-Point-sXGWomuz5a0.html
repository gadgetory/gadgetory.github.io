everyone seems to think it's just
folding some cardboard but you know I
don't blame the people Nintendo's
marketing team over the last 10 years
has been hit or miss to say the least
consider the following we fit and Wii
Fit Plus combined sold over forty three
point eight million units that's almost
half the total number of Wii consoles
even though it was a mold breaking
accessory for a first-of-its-kind
console everyone understood what it was
and they wanted it then the Wii U was a
complete flop because basically no one
knew what it even was months after it
came out I invited some friends over and
not a single one of them understood that
it was a new console before they arrived
after seeing the ads most of them
thought it was just a tablet accessory
and these guys are gamers and tech heads
I guess that's why it only sold thirteen
point six million units then there's the
switch and instant sensation
so naturally the roller coaster
department was due for a flop and lab oh
well I don't have sales numbers yet but
I can make an educated guess that
they're not very high now to be fair it
is a bit more niche than something like
a Wii Fit naturally but I believe the
main problem is that this guy's just
pretty misunderstood you want to know
what it's really about
keep watching today's video is brought
to you by Mack Weldon Mack Weldon makes
great underwear t-shirts socks wallets
and more they believe in simple shopping
and if you use code tech tips you'll get
20% off through the link below
so you got me you do start with folding
cardboard but the cardboard folding
experience is just teaching you the
basics in a fun creative and engaging
way it's not what the whole experience
is about it's like the first mission in
a game and I must add with the best
instructions of any project I've ever
built hands down you'll see them through
this whole explanation
the first labo project you build is a
little bug car it teaches you that
vibration can make things move that you
can manually control the vibration
frequency and introduces the concept
that you can see things through the IR
camera especially IR trackers the
fishing game teaches you about the
physical feedback of generating
resistance through the use of rubber
bands and the audible feedback from the
clicking noise generated by a cardboard
tab being hit by the reel the motorbike
teaches you about the use of gyroscopes
and advances on the ideas of resistance
and feedback with the throttle the house
teaches you intermediate IR camera use
how it responds to IR stickers and how
the stickers getting closer to the
camera or turning away from the camera
etc can be registered and responded to
and finally the piano shows you that you
can take these concepts much further
than you may have previously thought
that you're not just limited to one or
two IR stickers or a couple basic
interactions all of this is fun and
games
literally and depending on the age range
of the person enjoying it finishing
these projects may be the satisfying
conclusion to a fun solo or group
project with great pacing but labo is
really about wait for it the lab part of
the name it's about doing things
yourself and experimenting like in a lab
and you do this through toy con Garage
which allows you to create your own toy
con projects through the use of a basic
programming interface that lets you tap
into the power of the switch and it's
multifunctional joy cons that you've
just spent the entire cardboard folding
experience learning about and the power
is real ariana grande Jimmy Fallon and
the roots did an astonishing performance
of no tears left to cry with just
Nintendo lab o instruments we left out
audio for copyright reasons but it
sounds in
credible better than the original in my
opinion go watch it now and then come
back then we have Japanese researcher
and inventor Kintaro Yoshi Fuji who
modded a 13 year old boys electric
wheelchair so that could be driven
around with the motorcycle toy instead
of the normal joystick for just some
awesomely wholesome fun but you don't
have to go that crazy with it either I
found on YouTube there's people who have
recreated game and watch which is really
cool there's also a bunch of different
people making like vending machines and
one that I really like is you take a
container at the IR camera looking down
into the container and then just have it
count how many things pass his body so
you can throw things and see if it
actually goes in and keep score it's
cool so in conclusion then should you
buy a lab oh whether it's for a little
kid you know or a big kid you are I
think Brad on Twitter actually put a
little bit better than I can
yes but not for the folding cardboard
it's about the experience as a whole
it's about building something with
others and empowering you to play with
your own creation it works on its own
but it's best enjoyed as a social
creative thing like building IKEA
furniture except fun and with no
potential to ruin your relationships
