starts at the old office today because
why are there so many pairs of shoes
here there's more behind the door and
mine if you call these shoes well just
because we're moving into a new office
doesn't mean the old office has shut
down in fact we've done a lot of clean
up which is not immediately apparent
from the place where I'm standing and
we've actually added two more people
that I'm going to introduce real quick
here let's go
freshbooks is the online accounting
service for small business owners that
gives you the tools to make you feel
like the boss you are click on my face
to learn more about it so it starts
right here this is John he's from
America Oh
so let's say America Wow so I he'll be
helping us out with fast as possible
scripts which he's actually already been
doing on a contract basis but now he's
full-time he made it across the border
legally somehow I'm working on the next
exciting episode of fast as possible
right now are you yes
oh how RFID works fascinating and the
editing den got cleaned up in terms of
both its uh you know appearance because
we had to shoot the whole room water
cooling conclusion and it's ethnic
diversity so this is Dennis who is
hailing from Taiwan hi I'm from Taiwan
he had it's videos which is good do you
speak English yeah I do a little bit a
little bit yesterday okay so he'll be
editing fast as possible as well as any
of the other things that we throw at him
in fact he actually did a what was that
blog style them that you did the other
day personally yeah so Dennis with some
help from IDI I did the last personal
rig update as well so let him know with
a comment under the video if you're
impressed with any other work that he's
done which so far you know of one thing
so and as promised here's some more of
the alleged tidying up that was done so
some of you the astute among you might
have noticed that Dennis is sitting at
what used to be my desk so I don't have
one anymore until we move that was never
supposed to happen they were supposed to
join us after the move but ah so this is
my desk I'm actually sitting on what
used to be kind of like a bench testing
table and I'm using my laptop as my rig
which is in my backpack at the moment so
oh this
good I don't want to forget my power
adapter so let's head to the new office
and see if they've made any progress I
hope to be moving in soon all right
we're here so let's go inside I
legitimately don't know what's been done
since the last time I've been here so
this will be this will be quite the
adventure here it's a lot Wow it's a lot
more spacious over here so a lot of the
construction material e stuff has been
relocated our garbage bin is almost full
ah okay no I lied this I knew about so
we've actually had our our main man
Justin over here moving a whole bunch of
stuff and assembling shelving so these
shelving units which used to be just on
a pallet completely unassembled have now
been put together and are full of all
the empty boxes of all the hardware that
we're currently using at the office as
well as just any other low value stuff
that we thought is probably safe to
store in the warehouse with all the
workers milling about I don't think
anyone's going to take off with our you
know Horsehead mask or anything like
that so uh yeah so this is actually wow
this is fairly deep I don't even know if
we're going to be able to get at this
stuff this is set walls which I think
I've talked about before and then this
is a bit of a better look at the low
value pile in the corner here and all
the empty boxes and stuff so this is all
boxes we have to keep because we're not
going to junk it and we want to have the
boxes and accessories in case we ever
need it for something but we didn't want
it taking up a whole whack load of space
at the office so let's move over this
way doop doop doop doop doop mmm
once again something's been leaned
against the side but it looks like it's
at least light this time so I don't have
to be too upset oh look at this the peg
boards have been painted so these peg
boards are going to be part of the the
workshop set we're going to
actually legitimately use them as
pegboards as well and you know hang
things off of them so oh look there's
blue ones too I actually didn't know
that there were going to be different
colors so Esther from NCIX who is also
my sister-in-law has actually been
involved in a lot of the set design and
was over here painting these pegboards I
think yesterday ooh
Brandon's going to be exciting or
Brandon's always exciting to me
Brandon's going to be excited it looks
like we have two of his little carry
things around in the warehouse things
designed for you know c-stands and flags
and all that kind of building nonsense
that he needs other than that it looks
like no real changes to this backdrop
but doors are going in ooh fancy shmancy
so this door is actually going to be
integrated into one of the sets here
we're going to kind of blend it put some
you know stuff on it and when this door
is closed where I'm standing right here
will actually be the the workshop set
including an up to even as far as over
here depending on what angle we want to
shoot at so that is definite progress
now we can move inside the editing Den
has been painted so these are the you
know nice bright friendly happy colored
walls in here once the painting is done
I don't know if they've done all the
coats yet but once the painting is done
they're going to be able to go around
and start doing finishing touches like
you know actually putting the outlets
and networking jacks on here not every
wall in the place will be wiped though
so you can see some rooms are going to
have accent walls in this case we went
with an orange accent wall for the
library that should contribute to the
cheerfulness I don't know whatever we
went with orange because it's kind of
our company color that's why there's an
orange wall don't overthink it Wow
tons of progress on the kitchen in fact
the cabinets are basically in we still
don't have the sink or anything like
that and yet I think it goes on I want
to say this side but don't quote me on
that and then we're going to have a
microwave here and then I
was a plan to have a second microwave
shelf but maybe we kicked that in the
nut somewhere along the line this is
where we're going to be storing all of
our customized cutlery and all that kind
of nonsense so yeah looking pretty good
so there's progress on the floors as
well this is something that wasn't quite
as apparent when we were filming before
so we're putting in vinyl tiles in some
places and carpet tile in other places I
can't remember what those where but
presumably the floor guys know
apparently one of the flooring guys has
watched a lot of our videos over the
years so that's pretty cool in here it
looks like there's actually wet cement
they are pretty close then I guess to
actually building in the bathroom stuff
here so I was entirely wrong when I did
one of the previous tours here the
toilet is not over there the toilet must
be here so there you go and that I guess
is where the saint's goes so Luke
shouldn't hit his head too bad in here
in spite of the fact that the stairs are
part of the bathroom okay this is where
Harry Potter will live this is the true
home of Harry Potter okay a bunch of
people were thinking he was going to be
living out in the warehouse do I seem
like the kind of person who would make
someone live out in the warehouse no no
I am NOT another accent well looking
nice so the front entryway here is going
to be liven up a little bit like that
and we have access to the stairs now wow
this has changed a lot
so lots of finishing touches here while
that ceiling feels really really high I
guess you lose track of how high up you
are in a building when you're standing
on stairs and stuff so let's have a look
at what's going on up here doors are
going in apparently there is a green
accent wall in this bathroom so that's
cool they are like really working right
now so this yeah here we go
so this office I had some people noticed
that we didn't have a window in this
office well there is a window it's just
built into the door okay
the meeting room looks like they have
looks this looks like just some little
touch-ups for you no mark somewhat not
so I guess they're going to do like an
actual let's say they've done the
cutting in but not oh someone's working
on this right now so that's why I
couldn't figure out sort of what stage
of completion this was that but paint is
actually wet right over there in the
corner so conference room more progress
and it looks like oh I get another
accent wall in my office so this is what
the line of Sebastian office is going to
look like with the orange wall here in
the view outside right there now there
is something I would like to address
something that we received a lot of
requests for and for that we will have
to head downstairs I changed my mind
Harry Potter will be living here thanks
to the fact that there is a sprinkler in
Harry Potter's room that way if he's
ever pissing me off I'll know what to do
get the hose again here it is my friends
you asked and we delivered you guys
wanted to see a fire pole in the Linus
Media Group office now yes you are
seeing a fire pole in the Linus Media
Group office is it real is it an
illusion only the editors will know guys
