brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries silver here with Steven
Baker the lead sound designer on strife
and we're gonna get into exactly what
his unique contribution is to this game
after we talk a little bit about the
general stuff so you guys got to
differentiate from other MOBAs how are
you going to make it accessible for the
newb and yet customizable enough for the
experienced players well there's a lot
of fresh design techniques that our
designers did some of them include the
gold sharing mechanic when you are in a
lane with someone and you get a last hit
you actually share that gold with your
lane mate and that helps to really
reduce player toxicity as well as allow
you to collect gold even though you're
not last hitting so tell me about the
loadout system well that's gonna be
basically pregame before you queue
you're gonna be able to select your hero
select your pet and select items that
you like to play with okay so I'm a new
player my whole thing is okay I you know
some Pro that I like to watch uses this
particular kit usually so I just set
everything up before the game I don't
have to go to the store and shop no not
if you don't want to I mean it really
depends on how the game is is going like
you could have a loadout and you know
think that you're gonna do really well
but if it's not going your way you can't
actually go back into the shop and
reconfigure your loadout for maybe more
armor magic armor stuff like that okay
so if I'm a pro and I you know I feel
like the whole loading out ahead of time
is beneath me I can still go full custom
Oh totally
yeah okay that's awesome now let's talk
about you start about crafting and pets
our pets a purely aesthetic thing
absolutely not they actually serve a
great purpose in the game when you first
start the game you get to select a pet
and it's very it's like a baby basically
and it has only a small amount of
abilities but as you play the game you
get commodities at the end of the game
that include food you use the food to
feed your pet and the pet evolves and
actually develops its powers it grows
stronger it unlocks new passives and and
makes your active ability much stronger
so basically you guys are trying to make
anyone who bought a Tamagotchi ten years
ago feel really stupid about it because
they could just have played this game
had that experience and they get a game
for their money absolutely
speaking of money you guys are aiming
for what 15 Heroes 6 pets at launch now
your monetization model we all know how
League of Legends does it where you pay
for the heroes iFit they're not on
rotation how are you guys handling
heroes and and pay pay to play so to
speak well first off the game is
free-to-play and the heroes are free to
play so anytime that we design a hero it
will be free to play the 15 heroes that
you will be able to select from free to
play you know the things that we
monetize will include commodities for
crafting and also your skins for your
different heroes so I promise Steven we
wouldn't talk about gameplay mechanics
the whole time lead sound designer II
wants to talk about sound if you guys
have been watching me for any amount of
time you'll know I do believe that sound
is incredibly important one of my
mantras is go buy a bloody sound card
get some decent headphones not gaming
headphones good headphones enjoy your
games more it's incredibly important and
the conductor which is your baby is
going to make what I'm saying right now
even more true tell me about this
well the conductor is an adaptive music
system that absent flows the music based
on what's happening to your hero in the
game right so you start the game you're
in the laning phase not a lot of action
is happening you're just worried about
last hitting creeps and maybe harassing
the hero a little bit so it's very
low-key very easy to listen to you know
but but as the game progresses say maybe
you go into the jungle it's a little
more tense
you know because no one can see where
you are and the music really signifies
that and then maybe you're in a
situation where there's a teamfight
happening which the music goes huge
there there's a lot of different layers
that are happening at that time too to
add excitement to the players experience
so your goal here then is to get the
players heart pumping without them
really necessarily knowing get the
adrenaline flowing at the right times
without them even really even having to
think about yeah it is a very
unconscious subconscious kind of thing
that's happening to music I think that's
absolutely cool and I think that getting
away from games being designed to be
looked at while you have your music
going in your ear in your ears and
you're completely ignoring it I mean the
immersiveness is incredibly exciting so
thank you for taking the time to talk to
us about this this is absolutely great
and good luck my pleasure
now we're here with Pulu who is the
director of monetization for strife and
I think you do a bunch of other stuff as
well right yeah so I worked as a lead
system designer for strife and I work
with a game design team as well making
awesome heroes hopefully all right so
we're gonna have some great conversation
with you because it's a free-to-play and
as as a monetization strategy
free-to-play is anything but mature if
there's so much more to be experimented
with what are you guys doing with strife
to make it work for you I think you're
seeing here a free to play games popping
up all over the place and a lot of them
are going with a cookie cutter kind of
dual currency when you earn and one you
get for free right or sorry when you
purchase someone where you what you get
for free for playing and what we've done
with strife is rather than having that
we've developed commodities and
commodities or something that you earn
still but each of them serves a specific
function so this allows a lot of
dynamics as far as what trade-offs you
have when you earn food you can feed
your pets and when you get or you can
craft your items but when you get SSS
you can either harmonize your items or
you can make them better so there's a
lot of trade offs that don't
exist when you only have one earned
currency that exists when you have this
more higher level of commodity furniture
okay now speaking of crafting items and
all that I want to talk about okay it's
not related at all forget the Segway but
tell me about the eSports strategy for
strike what are you guys doing to
differentiate yourself from the other
stuff that's out there for eSports we
really wanted respond to the demands of
what our community wants so we're still
pre-beta people haven't gotten their
hands on it
the only people who played on Leyte are
like our friends and our families and
our co-workers so we want to see what
our community wants if they want to talk
heavy system in which there's just one
invitational tournament that's the you
know the hub of all that then we'll
respond to that or if they want
sometimes more grassroots more regular
automated tournaments that anyone can
get access into and maybe the prizes
aren't as high for each of them but
everyone can participate then we respond
to that as well so we want to see where
our fire wants to do because at the end
of the day we believe that you sports
it's a service for the community bring
everyone to gather around the game and
to get really hyped up and it really
amped and excited now the word everyone
is interesting because you guys don't
want to abandon the hardcores of course
because the hardcore gamers are gonna be
your biggest supporters but what have
you done if you were to pick three
things that have made this game more
accessible and that are gonna help to
draw in new players well they're theirs
as the MOBA genre develops there's been
a lot of issues brought forth so four
years ago when we were development here
as a new earth and right was developing
League of Legends and whatnot they we
were all focusing on scratching the
surface making sure that John is gonna
be fun it's going to be successful
people are gonna play our games now that
we kind of have the luxury of sitting
back and saying okay Bobo are a good
formula we can talk about more the
in-depth issues the issue of toxicity
and a lot of people have brought this up
about the mobile community people are
kind of asshole sometimes
and um we it's we've really come back
and put our fingers on that people are
assholes to each other generally when
they're on the same team and they
disagree about how to win a game
so intra team conflict has been a huge
thing for us and what strife we've done
several things to tackle that we've
developed the game from the ground up
from the game design to try to alleviate
some of the tensions within your team as
far as competing for last hits who's
gonna play the support role that no one
wants to play who's going to devote all
their gold to buying the wards so
there's no purchasable vision
there's no supporting by sacrificing
instead of sacrificing we allow our
support players to still get items and
enable their teammates and support that
way instead so tell me about the way
that gold gets split when you're either
sharing a lane with someone or you're in
your own lane and everyone else is all
over the place in order to make people
not beasts not behave selfishly yeah so
every mobile veteran has probably gone
through the argument of I need the last
hits no I need the last hits and it
comes down to this
all or nothing whoever gets the last say
it gets all the gold and so you're
competing with your lane mate I assume
baguettes last hit and stripe however
you split the gold and how this works is
if you're solo you get half of the gold
bounty of a creep so say it creeps worth
70 gold you get 35 and the other half is
split across your team evenly including
yourself so you end up with 42 if you're
with another Lane partner you each get
half of the gold so you each get 35 so
realistically if you're soloing you
might get last of the last less of the
last hits then when you have a part of
helping you out as well so you actually
want your teammate there but when
they're there you're not fighting over
it you're not taking something from then
they're not taking something from you
you're working together toward an end
goal together I mean the way that I see
this is this helps the casual players as
well as the as the more competitive
players because this does two things is
number one is it makes it so that that
that one player on a competitive team
doesn't have to be the bitch who has no
unless no items by the end of the game
and it was basically just kind of
running around doing everyone else's
dirty work and it also means that for
someone who's a more a much more casual
player they're not necessarily gonna get
left behind to the same extent I mean
that's someone who only ever really
played dota 1 as far as the MOBA genre
goes I can tell you as someone who kind
of played it casually and jumped in by
you know 10 15 minutes into the game
there was that one guy who was just
gonna completely dominate the match and
then there was me and every time I saw
him he was gonna just totally kick my
ass and what have you guys done to
change that besides just the gold
splitting so another thing we've done is
that when you kill a player the gold you
get rewarded with will be dependent on
their relative effectiveness and power
to you
so gold per minute is a really important
metric for us static it basically
calculates how much gold have you been
earning this game and if you kill
someone with less moles per minute than
you do you'll get less gold and on the
on the flip side if they kill you and
you have higher than them they get bonus
gold so this really really incentivizes
our top player
go pick on someone their own size and
leave the little guys alone a little bit
and for us striped is a game that we
don't want and we've all it all have
this experience where you play a game
with your friend you try to introduce
them to to a game you're not really
playing with them you're playing the
same game as them but you gotta show
them off in a corner it's like you learn
the game while I go and win it on my own
we really want striking experience where
you're playing with your friends with
your girlfriend with your pot with your
kid not just shoving off show me them
off in the corner by your words what not
well that is incredibly exciting is
there anything else that you'd like to
add for the audience in terms of the
innovation that you guys have put into
this game yeah I think the last really
cool part is that you get to pick your
hero before the game starts so what this
allows us to do is not only take the
stress off of it a little bit it's like
oh god I have 90 seconds now I gotta
pick my hero everyone's gonna yell at me
no you get you're gonna take your time
pick your hero pick your gear set kick
your crafted items pick your head do
everything that you want to do to set up
the experience that you have in mind and
then the other thing that does is allows
us to assign a hero specific Ehlo so if
you have to hear that you're really good
with cuz you played it 150 times we know
that we will know your reckoned with
that hero and we'll be able to sign you
with teammates and opponents of an
equipment incredible level so that you
have a good game whereas if you're a
really high level player but you're
trying a new hero you might not be rated
as high so you're not punished we're
trying something completely new very
cool thank you very much this has been
absolutely fantastic and enjoy the rest
of the show thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
