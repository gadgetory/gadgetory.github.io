some of the top gaming desktops that we
saw at CES 2015 we wanted to do a top
gaming notebooks one because actually I
feel like some of the amazing notebook
technology that we saw this week is even
better than what we saw in the desktop
so without further ado here we go
could this be one of our top gaming
laptops of CES this year is this even a
laptop I mean this thing weighs what 4.7
kilograms has got a massive 18 point 4
inch 1080p display and it is big like
whoa look at it it is thick look at this
thing this is the GTA T Titan SLI and
this is a whole new concept as far as
gaming laptops are concerned it's got a
core i7 4980 HQ processor dual nvidia
gtx 980m 8 gig graphics cards that i
mentioned that msi is committing to
offer nxm upgrade modules for at least
two generations that are compatible with
this as well as a cooling solution it
supports up to four ddr3 modules for a
total of 32 gigs of ram up to 4 m dot 2
SATA SSDs in raid 0 in addition to a two
and a half inch hard drive it's got
their killer networking so it's got two
by two AC as well as wired networking
it's got a 1080p webcam but the real
killer app for this one is aside from
the upgrade ability so you can actually
access all those components I was
talking about before the optical drive
for M dot M SATA M twos as well as two
of the dims the other two are on the
bottom and the tune half inch drive
aside from upgradability it is this guy
right here this is a Cherry MX brown
mechanical gaming keyboard built right
into this notebook and what is a true
Marvel about this is it actually
maintains the same profile off the desk
as a regular mechanical gaming keyboard
is this the most practical thing ever
would it make more sense to carry around
a mechanical gaming keyboard with you
whenever you had to travel with your
system I will leave that up to you guys
but this is definitely a one-of-a-kind
piece of machinery and something that
will appeal to some folks out there I
know this for a fact
continuing our tour of the top gaming
notebooks of CES 2015 out of everything
that gay
white hat on display this is the one
that really stood out to me not only
does it have a core i7 quad core
processor and it's you know got this
extremely slim form factor great mix of
i/o with 4 USB 3 ports dual HDMI mini
DisplayPort out it's got a glass
touchpad it's got actually a fairly nice
chiclet keyboard with a full number pad
and macro keys over on the left it's got
a 3k or optionally a 4k 90 N that's an
EXO display on top of all that stuff
point 9 inches then it's got geforce gtx
960 5 m graphics cards uh in sli yes
this is a dual GPU sli notebook in an
extremely slim form factor and it packs
a bunch of other stuff in there -
instead of compromising the way that we
see thin and light gaming notebooks do a
lot of the time it doesn't have any
limitations in terms of storage you've
got up to 3m - SSDs supported along with
a two and a half inch hard drive and it
doesn't compromise on memory with up to
four ddr3 sodium's supported for a total
of 32 gigs of ram our next notebook is a
little bit of an unusual one yeah
features a core i7 quad core 4870 HQ
processor yeah it's got 16 gigs of ram
it can hold up to 2 SSDs and raid 0 13.3
inch IPS display backlit chiclet
keyboard beautiful super slim
lightweight design and
iris graphics well hold on a second line
is that doesn't sound like much of a
gaming notebook well the real magic for
this one happens in the box underneath
it at the back of this notebook is a
little flap that covers a full PCI
Express 16x slot PCI Express 16 X Gen 3
so this is desktop-class connectivity to
this box down below that not only has
additional USB as well as killer
Ethernet and audio ports but also a
cooling fan a 450 watt power supply and
room for any desktop graphics card you
could pretty much want msi is saying
you'll have support for any msi GPU and
any reference GPU from either Nvidia or
AMD and all you got to do is power down
the system slide it into this locking
dock right here
power it back up and boom you are
outputting from what they've got in here
is a gtx 980 if I recall correctly the
output to an external monitor and you
are having a desktop great gaming
experience except when you want to pick
it up and be on the go and then you have
a super lightweight notebook did I
mention it's called the GS 30 shadow I
don't think I did but that's what it's
called so we found our next sick gaming
notebook and the Intel performance
notebook suite I mean imagine finding
some high-performance notebooks there
this is the HP omen 15 so it's a 15.6
inch 1080p model with a full 10-point
multi-touch touchscreen for me
personally that is something that I do
really appreciate it's got a Core i7 47
10 HQ it's got a geforce gtx 860m SSD I
think this particular one has 8 gigs of
ram and okay so those specs don't sound
really that amazing for me this one is
more about the look aside from the very
striking material choices that HP has
made for this one with the textured back
cover as well as the sort of the angular
shape to the way that it sits on the
desk
you've actually got this is kind of cool
lights that illuminate in the
surprisingly loud and clear speakers
along the right-hand edges you've got a
red backlit keyboard a super like mega
wide touchpad
that is incredibly pleasing to use and
then on the bottom itself let's go ahead
and close this bad boy you've got
basically an entirely perforated surface
along the entire back of the notebook
that keeps it nice and cool it's got a
rubber ring around the bottom so it
doesn't slip around when you're moved
using it on your desk and this is
actually something that I appreciate
more than maybe even more than I should
so there's two rear exhaust vents at the
back in addition to power in four USB
3.0 ports HDMI out mini DisplayPort oh
and a headphone jack I really like
having i/o at the rear I find so many
notebook makers put i/o on the right
especially USB ports like if they're
only on the right then I finally get in
the way of your mouse hand if you want
to actually game with the thing by
plugging in a mouse for HP the only
thing on the right hand side is an SD
card slot and other than that it is
completely clean around the outside of
the notebook now this little number
right here is a pretty normal looking
gaming notebook it's got a 15.6 inch
1080p display it's got an Intel Core i7
47:10 HQ processor that's a quad core
it's got a geforce gtx 970m
or an r9 295x2 GPU up to 16 gigs of ram
and m2 SSD for storage along with the
tuna 1/2 inch hard drive and a pretty
typical IO configuration some lighting
effects it's not like hyper thin or
anything like that okay all that at the
back that's not a standard looking IO
thing that is the port for alien wares
graphics amplifier the box that's
sitting right next to it so what this
does is it's a proprietary connector
that features a PCI Express gen3 4x link
as well as some other tomfoolery to give
your notebook both expanded i/o so
additional USB ports I'm pretty sure
that's the only thing they got back here
yeah some additional USB ports as well
as a full PCI Express 16x graphics card
slot inside the box that is powered by a
375 watt power supply so the demo
they're running right here actually has
this notebook running shadow of mordor
with a GTX 980 desktop graphics card
powering this 4k display and
through the systems or the systems only
acting as CPU memory storage actually
everything except the GPU where this one
takes over for whatever mobile GPU would
normally have in the laptop well I hope
