Artemis spectrum g6 33 and g9 33 you
guys may have seen my video here where
Brandon and I checked out the Logitech
design facility in kamas where they
actually developed these headphones that
was an awesome trip and was sponsored by
Logitech you may have also seen the
sponsor spots that we've had on the wind
show and in some standard content as
well this video however is a review and
because of that it is naturally not
sponsored by Logitech usually we have a
review of a product up before we start
doing any sponsored content for it but
this was not the case here this won't
change the actual review and spoiler
alert while I think they're mostly quite
good they're also not perfect so yeah
Logitech thinks they're going to sound
great have great voice and be very
comfortable let's see if that's true
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
show you the link in the video
description to learn more these two
different headsets are more or less
actually the same thing both featuring
Logitech's 40 millimeter projet driver
16.8 million color RGB lighting
swappable side panels coming with stock
looking logitech ones by default
logitech Jiki macro buttons on the back
of the left ear cup multi-platform
support for pc and modern consoles dolby
digital and DTS technologies inside
which you can swap between or turn
completely off in the software suite but
there is a core difference here and that
is that the g6 33 is a wired and
convict's 2 audio signals 1 through the
3.5 millimeter jack and one through the
USB connector while the g9 33 is
wireless and commits three audio signals
the two previously mentioned and another
through the wireless band the audio
mixing is basically logitech allowing
you to use all of your different
available inputs at once
this may sound understandably weird at
first but the idea of being able to mix
in your computer and your TV your record
player could be cool to you and being
able to keep your headset on while
playing a game and simultaneously
ordering pizza is pretty rad as well
I don't expect even a majority of owners
will even use this feature but it's neat
nonetheless the logitech gaming software
is where you control the fun things like
the RGB controls allowing you to change
their color whether or not they're solid
color breathing or cycling their colors
the rate at which they complete these
various actions what zones they're on
their brightness etc you can also switch
between Dolby Surround DTS or just
turning all the digital stuff off you
can also choose to run an arrangement of
different equalizer profiles or go full
custom and tune it as you'd like
speaking of tuning it as you'd like you
can configure your G keys to do
basically anything by default G one is
cycle effect G 2 is switched surround
sound off air on and G 3 cycles through
EQ profiles leaving us with on the back
left ear cup with a switch that goes
between the 3.5 millimeter and USB
inputs a scroll wheel for volume and
button for the mic you can also mute the
extendable boom mic by just putting it
back into its elegantly hidden hidey
hole place and the mic does sound very
good for a gaming headset I don't
necessarily think that it competes
against something like a desk mounted
microphone but for something in a whole
package that's nice and can be hidden
away it does quite well alright so this
is the mic test section of the review
we're going to compare it against the
standard lab that I normally wear now
this isn't actually perfect it's going
to be compressed by you tube a little
bit and we're recording it with audacity
this won't go over the standard VoIP
service or whatever you're using to talk
to your friends whether that's Skype or
teamspeak or whatever it is it won't
sound exactly the same but this should
give you a rough representation of how
the mic sounds I'm going to do a few
things here
I could always purr just in case we need
to be really sneaky in this game oh my
god we just won the game that's awesome
we kill the Nexus or did something
defuse the bomb I don't know good job
team in terms of the audio quality of
the cans your mileage may vary depending
on what mode you have the man in terms
of Dolby DTS or nothing I can say with
confidence however that they're pretty
great a leg above the Logitech G 2:30
and 4:30 and most things in their
category but that being said that should
be expected as when looking at their
price they're getting pretty close to
some of the most expensive gaming
headsets that there are available now
how about comfort in a standard seated
position without much movement I would
say they feel pretty awesome the
material used feels great they breathe
well I have no issues with heat wearing
them for an entire day was no issue at
all in terms of that scenario I
specified without much movement because
unfortunately I'm unable to even have
the bold enough attempt to drink water
without them probably falling off my
head as they don't really hold on very
well it's uncomfortable and a little bit
annoying I tested this on some team
members around the office and found that
Taryn Nick van Berkel John and myself
all shared this experience and had major
problems with it Colton and Nick both
had light problems with it
to some various degree and Linus alone
didn't have any problem with it at all
what does this mean well it means that
there isn't necessarily an easy answer
they sound quite good the mic is solid
although there's some people online that
are complaining about it like working at
all
they're quite durable considering they
still work just fine and aren't damaged
despite the amount of times they've
fallen off my head and onto the floor
logitech made a lot of great choices
here and I believe that these are a
great step forward from their previous
headsets while they're comfortable and
breathable I find that the padding is
too slippery that coupled with the
weight distribution largely being behind
the headset ah makes some kind of weird
results despite how cool they look
that's actually weird but what does this
mean for you well considering our
testing was a little bit random
depending on who the person was here I
would suggest if at all possible trying
them on if you live near a little tech
shop that has headphones on display
these are probably going to be fairly
popular considering they're from
Logitech so they might have them on
display I would recommend trying them on
if they're fine for you great a big part
of the problem too is that they kind of
slide so even if I put them on and they
happen to not fall off if I hold my head
there long enough they will eventually
fall off whoa so I don't know
