completed cat tree home and the cats are
exploring it we've only got some of the
carpet in and it's like definitely not
done as far as carpet goes but the
carpentry is all done and so that's that
we're letting them sort of have a sniff
around and see what they think of it of
their new house and that's pretty much
it still lots of work to do we still
gotta we're gonna cover the entire thing
in carpet and then all the upright posts
in a in a sisal fabric so yeah very cool
stuff actually here maybe I'll get a
couple other angles of it as well so you
can we can see we're actually missing
part of the plan here there's gonna be a
ramp from right about here up to this
door and then so that'll be the way to
access the house and then you come out
the back of the house through the door
here and then you can climb up onto this
platform which will obviously be covered
in carpet from there you can jump up
here and you can enjoy this house and
then you can jump up onto this platform
this one and then way up to the ceiling
off on that top platform there so I'm
just going to back up you can see the
whole house there there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
