completed cat tree home and the cats are
exploring it we've only got some of the
carpet in and it's like definitely not
done as far as carpet goes but the
carpentry is all done and so that's that
more letting them sort of have a sniff
around and see what they think of it of
their new house and that's pretty much
it still lots of work to do we still
gotta we're going to cover the entire
thing in carpet and then all the upright
posts in a in a sizable fabric so yeah
very cool stuff actually here maybe I'll
get a couple other angles of it as well
so you can you can see we're actually
missing part of the plan here there's
going to be a ramp from right about here
up to this door and then so that'll be
the way to access the house and then you
come out the back of the house through
the door here and then you can climb up
onto this platform which will obviously
be covered in carpet from there you can
jump up here and you can enjoy this
house and then you can jump up onto this
platform this one and then way up to the
ceiling off on that top platform there
so I'm just going to back up and you can
see the whole house there there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
