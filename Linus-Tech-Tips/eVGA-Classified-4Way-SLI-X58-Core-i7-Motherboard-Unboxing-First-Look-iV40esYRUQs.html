because we had one of these about as an
open box in like new condition I'm gonna
be having a look at the EVGA x58 4 Way
SLI classified motherboard so this has
support for core i7 xtreme core i7 it is
an X 58 board is SLI and physics ready
and it's also crossfire ready but given
that at EVGA they're not exactly going
to talk about that ok so the features
list is long I'm not gonna say
everything but I'll go ahead and tell
you some of the key stuff ok so there's
10 say 2 to 3 gigabit per second ports
it has V group control it has a hundred
percent solid state capacitors which is
what you'd expect on a premium premium
board like this anodized black CPU
socket with three times the amount of
gold content that's a pretty cool
feature it has a 10 phase digital PWM
and it has the elite EVGA motherboard
tuner software and you can use up to 2 8
pin power connectors for this
motherboard if you are taking your CPU
to the extreme and you actually need
that much power so it comes in an
enormous black box ok so just for scale
ok this is one of the times I'm gonna
pull this out that is how big the box is
compared to the size of a normal
motherboard okay so let's keep the
keeping that in mind let's continue to
go forward from here so let's open this
guy up and have a look inside
oh ok there's a BJ's warranty
information EVGA has a terrific warranty
they have a great reputation for that so
feel free to take advantage of that if
you're buying an EVGA product I love
these they include these with all of the
motherboards that I've seen from them a
visual guide of the motherboard that
shows you the basics how to get it all
set up to start with it labels
everything for you and then on the back
it gives you all of the pin outs for
things like the front panel connectors
ok so if you need any help with any
jumpers that are available on the
particular board they've spelled that
all out for you I think that's a
terrific thing to include with the
motherboard it's a great little value
that ok here's their ECP v2 which
basically connects
one cable to your motherboard and then
gives you all of that onboard stuff that
you might need so on board power clear
CMOS reset a little post led that gives
you codes if there's any problems with
the system as well as PCIe disable
jumpers so you can turn off some of the
PCIe ports it looks like which I guess
makes sense to them they're an awful lot
of them on this board in here you will
find six black SATA cables can you see
those at all yeah you can kind of see it
okay and then one rounded IDE cable and
then three molex to two theta
adapters that's pretty nice I mean here
you will find a 3-way SLI bridge because
if you're buying a board like this you
had better be running 3-way or four-way
SLI so this is a four-way SLI bridge
here that means that with the EVGA GTX
295 classified you can actually run four
cards at a time on this board here is
the cable put a little um whatever is
called ECP thing that has all of your
own board switches and whatnot there's a
standard sli bridge okay so this is a
floppy bridge so it means that you can
plug these cards into a variety of
connectors you can decide which one you
want to use here's your i/o shield
they've got that puppy stuff on the back
of it I'm not actually sure why that is
but a lot of the high-end Estes boards
and apparently EVGA board have that
alright so let's get this motherboard oh
no there's more accessories okay so
that's got two USB and one firewire port
for the back of your case and then
finally we have the motherboard user's
manual as well as a driver disk and a
case baju that's nice 3-way SLI case vag
alright and then there's a little note
in here you have just purchased an
incredible piece of technology with
four-way SLI support 10 phase digital
PWM in all in order to run four-way SLI
mode you will need to have the hardware
to support it so you need the two oh no
it just says it's the perfect match it
doesn't say you need that ok a dedicated
PCIe molex connector so make sure you
plug that in and this motherboard is
designed for the extreme it requires to
be run in either a 10 slot PC chassis or
an open-air chassis if your chassis
does not meet these requirements please
do not install this motherboard okay so
that's a pretty important note to have
on there so why don't we go ahead close
that up and then I'm gonna I'm gonna
close the box and that gives us a good
place to to demo the mortise so okay so
let's get this out of the baby here all
right
motherboard coming out now look at that
so that is the classified four-way SLI I
don't even know where to start with this
thing so why don't we start at the CPU
socket like I normally do so this is an
LGA 1366 motherboard okay so that means
that you've got support like I said
before for the core i7 and core i7
extreme you can see that the CPU socket
itself is extremely shiny can you see
the the finger shot there so that is one
of the things that they've done they're
using a high-quality loads socket okay
you've got support for triple channel
ddr3 memory as per the normal
arrangement on an x58 motherboard your
power connectors and these are kind of
unique are in their ideal locations you
got your 24 pin power connector here and
then up here you have not one but two 8
pin CPU power connectors so check that
out I can't actually get that off ok so
you have two 8 pins up here on the top
left of the board in there ideal
locations
alright then in terms of the chipset
cooling this is incredible because you
can't actually run this many PCI Express
slots off just an X 58 chipset so
they've had to add I believe it's one
but I guess it could be as many as 2 NF
200 chips to this motherboard so you can
see that's why we've got this huge huge
heatsink area which actually is
connected by a heat pipe or two so you
can see under here the heat pipes can
you see those kind of kind of down there
yeah so you got heat pipes connecting it
to this fat art this fin arrangement
okay which is just enormous and you can
kind of see through that and then
tiny little 40 millimeter fan right here
making sure that it gets at least a
little bit of airflow so that's what's
doing all of the chipset cooling on this
motherboard okay so why don't we keep on
moving down so here we've got yeah okay
SATA ports so we've got eight SATA 2
ports here then we have oh this is this
is terrific because all of the onboard
power reset clear CMOS all of that stuff
is on the motherboard so this connector
way over here to run the little Evie
whatever thing that it's called is
actually just an alternate one just in
case you've got a bunch of video cards
installed which covers all of this stuff
and you need access to it that's great
so you've got seven PCI Express 16x
slots and they're actually further down
on the motherboard than they would be on
a normal board so I'm actually I'm gonna
pull out that other board here for a
second again and I'm gonna show you just
for scale how long this motherboard is
compared to a typical ATX board so if
cameraman can you try and get like a
top-down view you can see it's actually
one slot to long versus what a normal
board would be so that's that's pretty
cool besides that it's actually wider
than a normal spec ATX board by about a
couple centimeters there so if you look
over on the right-hand side you can see
this board is just huge
so that means besides being longer your
case is gonna have to have a little bit
of extra room on the side on the on the
right hand edge of the board to make
room for this extra strip here okay so
why don't we keep on moving here there's
an on board speaker right here's them
sorry about that my memory card ran out
again so right here we have the molex
connector so if you're actually plugging
in all those graphics cards this is a
supplementary power connector to make
sure that they're all getting enough
juice to run properly alright so why I
think we're almost done here but the
last thing we want to look at is the 10
phase digital PWM that they've installed
on this motherboard so you can see under
there that's where all of the power
regulation stuff is going on alright and
then let's move around actually one
thing that would be important to people
buying a board like this is you see how
bare the CPU socket is
it's perfect for insulating all around
the CPU socket if you're going to be
running like sub-zero cooling on it or
anything like that ok so why don't we
move around have a quick look at the
back of the board and then I think we're
pretty much done we've got one ps2 port
here for a keyboard we've got 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 USB 2.0 ports we've got a clear
CMOS button and then uh-oh I'm in
trouble I don't know what this is for
maybe someone can leave it in the
comments and then I'll make an
annotation okay
so then we've got firewire eSATA 2
Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio so thank
you for checking out my my quick
unboxing and first look at the EVGA
classified 4 Way SLI motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
