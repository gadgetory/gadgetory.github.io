brought to you by AT&amp;amp;T Samsung had their
priorities right with the note 4 there
are small improvements to things like
the pen by adding more pressure levels
which makes it more sensitive and
reliable when doing things like
selecting text along with some cool but
not groundbreaking software improvements
like better more intuitive multitasking
motions and support for 16 different
multitasking windows so more than your
need and all this works even when in one
handed mode Samsung also kept the ball
rolling on the performance front with
improvements almost all the way across
the board and while this wasn't entirely
expected it is still nice to see the
device also houses a large 16 megapixel
camera on the back opposite to a 3.7
megapixel selfie camera on the front
which is sporting AF 1.9 lens but now my
friends we get to the fun stuff the
panel on this bad boy is running at an
awesome 2560 by 1440 P yet has not
suffered from the loss of color depth
that we've seen on certain other phones
also running this resolution COFF COFF
g3 this results in one of the most
beautiful panels I've seen on a phone
for at least what I was able to use it
with on the show floor and it doesn't
stop there
Samsung has gone forward in leaps and
bounds when speaking of build quality as
many of you know I'm one of the first
people that point out the light and
crappy plastic feel of many Samsung
phones but this simply is not the case
with the note 4 the largely metal base
construction feels very solid in hand
and that feeling is continued on the
back the decision to remove the cheesy
fake stitching was very smart and now we
actually have the premium backing that
we all wanted from the note 3 as with
most things however it is especially
important that mobile phones are tested
for an extended period of time and I
would need more time with this phone to
make a proper review but I can honestly
say I'm quite impressed with the
elegantly well-built Note 4 thanks for
watching guys and hit me up on Twitter
at my new handle which is at Luc
underscore LAF are letting me know what
you guys think of the new Note 4 or as
