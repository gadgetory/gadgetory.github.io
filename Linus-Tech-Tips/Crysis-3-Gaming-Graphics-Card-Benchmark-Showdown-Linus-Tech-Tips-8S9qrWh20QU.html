gaming promo calm welcome to our crysis
3 video card performance reviews so this
is we're breaking our rule a little bit
guys so more on that in a moment but
this is our evaluation of at about a
hundred bucks about 200 bucks about 300
bucks and higher than that for different
price points what is the best video card
to buy we're going head-to-head Green
Team versus Red Team at a bunch of
different price segments so you guys
will know exactly what you should buy to
get the most out of Crysis 3 now why did
we break our rule the reason is because
Crysis 3 is such a new game no one has a
wickel release driver yet that's fully
optimized for it so when we first did
our tests with Titan where we compared a
crisis on the variety of platforms
Crysis 3 rather on a variety of
platforms we saw that AMD had a huge
advantage because their driver was
optimized for it now a our Nvidia just
released their optimized driver so now
we have an opportunity to go optimized
versus optimized head-to-head at those
different price points so our testbench
is a p9 x79 deluxe with 16 gigs of
muskan black line memory a 39 60 X at 4
gigahertz so that's a 6 core Intel
processor we're using an end tech
thousand watt power supply a 128 gig SSD
and for our software we are using
afterburner 2 point 3 point 1 to run all
of our overclock settings we overclocked
every card due to within a reasonable
level so we don't go absolute max
because this should be something that
you can obtain just by checking out our
spreadsheet which is going to be linked
under the video and dialing those
settings into your GPU they're pretty
much safe settings and then we're using
beta 3 14.1 4 for nvidia and beta 13.2
for AMD now here are our price ranges so
head-to-head for round one is the GTX
650 so that's this guy right here
actually that's not this guy right here
is the 650 power edition from MSI versus
a Radeon 7770 so these are 115 bucks and
120 bucks respectively
we'd also went for gtx 660 which is this
guy right here versus radeon 7870 which
is one of these two I believe it's this
guy right nope I'm wrong this guy right
here is 78 70 and then next was so those
are 229 and 230 nine respectively
next was 660ti which is this guy right
here versus 7950 right here so these are
289 and 299 and finally we have GTX 670
versus Radeon 7970 so the 670 is the one
that's actually still on the bench over
there and there's a very good reason for
that because we got some very cryptic
numbers from our GTX 670 which we think
we can explain because we're using beta
drivers which I really don't believe in
using but we had to do it for this game
because it's so fresh so let's here we
go so that our lowest-priced here you
can see this is pretty much a dead tie
remember guys the GTX 650 is actually
about eight percent cheaper than the 77
70 so if you take these two cards
overclocked them to the max well max ish
and run Crysis 3 you're going to get
eggs pretty much exactly the same
experience was it playable at very high
spec with anti-aliasing off not really
you're probably going to have to turn
this game down a little bit more but for
the sake of consistency between the
different cards that we ran we had to
pick one setting and kind of go with it
next up we've got the $200 weight class
of cards and again we see pretty much a
dead tie the gtx 660 does come ahead and
remember it was also a little bit
cheaper than the 7870 but this is sort
of within the margin of error when we
rerun our Crysis 3 benchmark which you
guys can check out it's also on the
channel our benchmarking procedure if
you when we rerun that over and over and
over again we get a variance of about a
couple percent so you can kind of take
all the results and factor that into it
as well so moving on to our $300 weight
class we've got another tie because
remember again the 660ti was a little
bit cheaper than the 7950 now pricing
for the cards we
use the latest pricing on NCIX we take
the second lowest card so the lowest one
we kind of throw it away and go that
might be some kind of crazy deal that
people can't get but the second lowest
one should be pretty much obtainable now
this is where things get weird when we
get into our $400 weight class
the 7970 scaled beyond the 7950 which
makes sense because it's a slightly more
powerful card but our GTX 670 actually
didn't perform any better than our 660ti
so the 670 is the same architecture as
the 660ti it has more functional units
it's clocked higher even when we're
overclocking both of them were it's like
it's clocked higher so we can only chalk
this up to a bit of driver weirdness in
the beta that probably won't be observed
once that data driver makes its way to
being a finished driver so to me it
looks like this is going to end up being
another dead tie once that optimization
is done but it just shows you sort of
AMD's a little bit further ahead from
Nvidia but we knew this because their
Crysis 3 optimized driver was released
before in videos when it comes to Crysis
3 finally here are all of the cards so
you can clearly see other than the 670
falling below where it's supposed to be
up next to the 7970 that each of those
price segments clearly defines itself
with a performance improvement so you
can also track on this spreadsheet this
is really cool where the best bang for
the buck lies because the gtx 660 and
the 7870 literally offer you double the
performance of the lower tier cards
whereas when you move up to 660 TI's and
79 50s you might get another 25% but
you're actually spending 50% more than
the previous than the previous tier of
cards so when it comes to Crysis 3 if
you want playable performance ok so
average around 40 fps you want to spend
a couple hundred bucks you're going to
get the best bang for your buck so we
can safely say that either the gtx 660
which is this guy right here or the
Radeon HD 7870
either of these would be fan
tastic options for a crysis 3 gaming rig
because they're able to maintain average
frame rates of around 40 FPS which is
very playable this is at very high
system specs running at 1080p
anti-aliasing is off so if you want to
start turning up those details those
higher end cards will start to pull away
more but for the basic gamer HD gaming
these cards are a great value so either
of them is a fantastic choice so I guess
my usual recommendations also stand if
you're going to be gaming and surround I
do recommend Eyefinity over Nvidia
surround it is a little bit easier to
configure and the compatibility is very
strong and if you're going to be playing
in stereoscopic 3d I definitely
recommend GeForce / Radeon because the
Nvidia 3d vision ecosystem is much more
stable and much easier to use than the
equivalent from the AMD side so that
pretty much wraps it up thank you guys
for checking out our Crysis 3 video card
roundup I hope this has made your life a
little bit easier if you're trying to
buy a video card for Crysis 3 and as
