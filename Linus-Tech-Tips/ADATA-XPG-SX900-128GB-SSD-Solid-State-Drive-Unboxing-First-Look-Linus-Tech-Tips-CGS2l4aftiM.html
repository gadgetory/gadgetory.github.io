the Aeneid a 2 x PG two and a half inch
SATA 3 6kt bit per second solid-state
drive this is their SX 900 this is a 128
gig SSD and that is exceptional for I
don't have my keys okay off to you this
up that is exceptional for one major
reason and that is that this is a sand
force drive so if you guys are familiar
with sand force drives already ah here
we go
I found a razor blender so if you guys
are familiar with Sun force drives you
probably know that they don't really
come in 64 gig 128 gig and 256 screen
capacities usually they come in 60 gig
120 gig and 248 capacities and the
reason for that is that sand force
drives have spare area so that capacity
is on their NAND chips only come in
certain denominations of capacity then
usually add up to you know 16 32 64 128
these are these are the natural
capacities however any data right so Sam
force drives usually have that area
tucked away for a couple of reasons one
is better performance over time so it
gives it somewhere to swap data out to
that's not really part of the logical
partition that you have on the drive so
it can speed things up a little bit and
then number two is for better
reliability because if flash or if any
of the cells die anywhere else on the
SSD it can actually start to borrow from
that spare area to increase the
longevity of the drive so look a nigga
had to do to release a 128 gig SandForce
SSD plus they had to use a higher
quality of bin end so that gives you the
well the extra reliability that you
would need in order to not have any
spare area so they backed it up with a
three-year warranty they've got what
else do they have on here Sam force
driven shock resistant it better be trim
support it better have it Acronis True
Image HD that's kind of cool to have so
okay Norton Internet Security is sort of
less relevant but how
Acronis True Image HD is cool you just
download it for free and you can use
that in order to clone your current
existing drive over to new SSD it
includes the mounting screws that you
need as well as a tune a half inch to
three and a half inch desktop adapter
finally you've got an SSD Quick Start
Guide as well as this might have like a
key on it or something
please free software overview this
release is compatible with XP Vista and
Windows 7 and it just shows you what to
do
cool second is your download key so yeah
you just download it from the 82 website
alright so let's have a look at the SSD
itself it has a pretty slick overall
look so you've got your brushed brushed
metal finish going on on the top as well
as the sides it's looks very nice got
like you know a labels shiny cool cool
you got all your usual mounting holes so
it's gonna work in your laptop as well
as your desktop as long as you don't
have you know a MacBook Air or something
that uses like a not a two and a half
inch standard drive warranty void if
broken so you don't want to go opening
this thing up and yeah there we did it
we showed the Acronis True Image HD key
there it is ah whatever okay so thank
you guys for checking out this unboxing
your first look so the important things
to take away from this are that a data
has delivered a higher capacity drive
although the the extra there is extra
cost associated with using a more
reliable manned the extra cost should
I'll compensate for the or you should be
able to compensate for the extra cost
with the extra capacity you get so you
actually do get an extra 8 gigs of
capacity which is about what six and a
half percent or so thanks for checking
out this unboxing and don't forget to
