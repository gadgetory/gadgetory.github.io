hey guys b-roll and I were wandering
around Computex and we came by rogue as
you can see and I noticed immediately
their mech food this thing is awesome I
know we have a few Hawking and mech
warrior fans in the audience because of
all the Nvidia giveaways that they've
been doing the talking and just the pure
amount of comments we get about mech
warrior I don't even know what to say
about this other than just biting for
time while b-roll gets awesome footage
this thing is awesome you have a the
main usable area of your keyboard here
shift will make it so you can use the
number keys among along the top you've
got communication buttons here for Team
chat or taunting people which is
hilarious you have a dedicated button
just to use a taunt in a game you go
from Auto to shift here
- awesome joysticks with like all the
hardcore buttons you could ever want
different thruster levels everything ah
the Holcomb nerd and hulking nerd in me
wants this so bad it would be absolutely
awesome I can tell
due to how a lot of these buttons are
made if it was plugged in through USB
that there would be back lights on them
but there is currently not this is
actually just a sample just the the
missile switches and stuff that are on
this are awesome you can hear here one
second you can hear that it has a very
tactile click that's awesome it feels
very real you know maybe not exactly
real because I've never actually used a
like fighter pilots control panel but it
feels real to me big big handlebars to
pick it up I'm not gonna do that because
again it's a sample so I don't want to
ruin it LCD screen up here I'm not
entirely sure what it displays up there
but I'm assuming it will be similar
stuff to g15 keyboards from logitech
where it can display like your ammo and
other things that you have right there
controlling a mech with this would just
be so awesome having both joysticks
ready to go there very nice looking
joysticks I again I'm just biding for
time so b-roll can get awesome awesome
footage of this because this thing is so
cool I'm very happy I came by rogue to
check it out just the amount of options
you can have and I love how they have
all different things it's not just a
million buttons there's actually
gradient switches
there's flipping switches over here
the dials that you can change big big
chunky buttons that look real that you
can press so if you want to bring up
your console it's one big button that
you can slam down or team chat
communication so you can hold it down it
just seems very real even though it is
plastic and it is going in through USB
it seems like you're in a fighter jet or
a mech warrior which is awesome if you
want to see all of our Computex content
