has passed three million subscribers
that's three million of you guys take
that PewDiePie okay he's still like 20
times larger than we are but what we do
have is an awesome giveaway powered by a
razor so check the link down in the
video description and follow me the
first laptop we're going to be giving
away is the new razor blade it features
an i7 6700 HQ a desktop-class GTX 1060
from Nvidia and 16 gigs of ram the
configuration that I chose to give away
has a 1080p screen that's because this
is a gaming inspired laptop you're
probably going to be playing at that
resolution natively anyways and that'll
save you a little bit on battery life
and then you have a one terabyte nvme
SSD so super crazy fast storage and a
ton of it and for all of that power it
is only 0.7 inches thick and weighs only
4.19 pounds geez for IO on the left hand
side you have a headphone microphone
combo jack 2 USB 3 ports and a power
connector on the right hand side we have
a Thunderbolt 3 and USB type-c port a
USB 3 port and HDMI 2.0 ports and a
Kensington lock slot which clearly
everyone is very excited for the next
laptop we have to give away is a $2,000
razor blade stealth featuring a KB Lake
i7 7500 u and 16 gigs of ram it also has
a 4k screen I know I just said like I'm
not configuring this one with 4k because
of gaming this laptop I'm more doing for
an artist so it has a 4k 100% Adobe RGB
colour space screen and a one terabyte
nvme Drive but that being said they're
not saying you can't game there just
isn't a dedicated graphics card so if
you do want a game come home plug it
into a razor core with your desktop
graphics card in here and then play away
at crazy performance levels now for IO
starting on the top of the left hand
side we have a Thunderbolt 3 USB type-c
power connector which is kind of really
cool because if you go home and dock
onto the core like I was just saying you
can plug that in the core will feed
power to your laptop the core will feed
graphics performance to your laptop all
that good stuff now below that we have
the USB type 3 port and a headphone
microphone combination port and then on
the right hand side we have an HDMI 2.0
port and a USB 3.0 port
now both of these laptops are beautiful
black cnc'd aluminum but Ed's Ayako back
home at the linus Media Group offices
has designed some really cool atching
that will be going on these laptops
unfortunately I don't have one of those
here as they still need to be done up
but you should be able to see some cool
images on the screen while I waste some
time saying useless words so you can see
cool laptops so like I said go to the
link in the video description down below
for information on how to enter this
contest but some additional information
for now the stealth if you win will be
shipped out later this month the blade
14 if you win will be shipped out later
in October just due to them still only
need to you know make them and get them
etched and all that kind of stuff so
