usa.com welcome to another unboxing and
first look in this case I am unboxing an
entire carton of my favorite thermal
compound so I it's funny because I sent
an email to I see diamond and it's it's
to see I see it's like I see haha
because it's cool I see diamond about
using their thermal compound on our
standardized thermal test bench and I
was like guys I really want to use this
but where is up select where's that old
tube I thought we still had it do you
have the old yeah there it is so here's
their old packaging I was like I really
want to use yours as our standardize
stuff do you think you can send me some
more thermal compound so that I can use
it and they sent me 25 tubes of it so
that I could use nothing but I see
diamond for everything ever I'm planning
to feed it to my baby so there you go
basically what makes this stuff good is
that it has a very high diamond content
which is thermally conductive it's also
doesn't dry out which is good I mean
most modern thermal compounds have all
these advantages but what I like about
icy diamond is it applies fairly thickly
so it's not messy and it spreads well
once it heats up and it is from my
experience one of the best performing
thermal compounds out there I really
like it it's really good to get a
consistent mount with because some
thermal compounds will perform great
once they cure or if you apply them in
just exactly this way whereas icy
diamond has always been very consistent
for me I used to do benchmarking of
water blocks long time ago where I do
comparative testing between blocks and
so I've tried a lot of different thermal
compounds and for me the most important
thing was not necessarily if on one
mount out of five I could get the best
temperatures ever for me it was every
time I apply this to something and put a
thing on it is it going to be consistent
and is going to perform well so this is
why I like this stuff so there you go my
personal endorsement of icy diamond
compound and my personal stash of icy
diamond
here's like you want some when I eat it
I dared him to eat it on the video
before the video started but I think
he's going to kind of bail on us come on
I said no why don't you do it when you
don't when you dared me I said no don't

away
