I don't conform to the mainstream trends
I don't need at all aspect ratio screen
a good camera or if Tim sleek design
what I need as a gamer is the fastest
high-resolution screen biggest thx sound
and the logo that says this product was
made by a lifestyle brand for gamers and
like it should have like our GPS okay so
just to be clear you don't want any of
the stuff that most people consider
important yeah as long as it has RGB and
shit
yeah Oh Kate thanks I think we're done
here
no not just yet first I need to tell you
about our sponsor if you guys don't want
more of the same cable Mollett is here
for you make your video card the main
attraction in your case by vertically
mounting it with cable mods vertical
PCIe bracket check it out at the link in
the video description
when we reviewed the razor phone one we
weren't exactly sure what a gaming phone
was supposed to be and frankly now that
we're looking at the second iteration it
isn't much more clear so under the hood
of the razor phone 2 you'll find a
qualcomm snapdragon 845 processor 8 gigs
of lpddr4 x ram 64 gigs of expandable
internal storage a large 4,000 milliamp
hour battery and dual 12 megapixel rear
cameras with sony sensors that support
4k 30fps recording just like pretty much
any other non gaming phone not to
mention in a much more attractive form
factor like this this whole thing that
they got going on this really looks more
like a cost saving approach to tooling
rather than an attempt to create an
iconic design which isn't to say that
they haven't improved anything to last
year's model they've added wireless
charging thanks to the glass back
slightly faster cellular networking ip67
water resistance a blessing and a half
for toilet gamers a brighter screen with
HDR capability and of course razer
crobat not gonna lie it looks pretty
sick like honestly I'm getting kind of
like an underwear model vibe here like
it's it's beautiful from the back with
the new glass finish and the
illumination but then it's got a face
that deserves to be cropped right out of
the frame like dem bezels yo the screen
the body ratio of the razor phone to is
absolutely abysmal for a modern device
and not helping matters is the sixteen
by nine screen aspect ratio that makes
the overall design of it feel really
dated especially with the on-screen
navigation buttons taking up even more
real estate like it kind of felt like
going all the way back to a four by
three monitor by comparison I mean in
fairness to razor sixteen by nine is
still the dominant aspect ratio for TV
and YouTube content consumption so
they've got that going for them and of
course in exchange for those unruly
bezels we are getting the rare treat of
dual amplified front-facing stereo
speakers it's just that the asus rog
phone has that too and it's bezels
aren't nearly as cumbersome that right
there is honestly the biggest problem
for the razer phone - it's not the only
gaming phone in town anymore and if we
compare our two gaming phones
side-by-side the ROG phone really seems
to meet or beat the razor phone - at
nearly every turn on the spec sheet and
it's got a headphone jack something that
raised our dresses with a dongle in the
box
so then contrary to our silly intro I've
always been into the performance aspects
rather than the lifestyle aspects of
gaming hardware so how does it fare
there then well this is actually a more
complicated question to answer than you
might initially think on mobile devices
in particular specs tell us only part of
the story a high-end CPU without
adequate cooling can perform like a mid
tier or even an entry-level one and it's
here that razer manages to really shine
while the razer phone - isn't far and
away the single fastest phone out of the
bunch we tested in its normal mode it
maintains its performance for longer
than many of the phones we tested our og
phone included in games this along with
its large battery makes its high
performance gaming endurance its main
source of gamer cred over most of the
competition moving on then of our three
major complaints about the razor phone
one we've crossed one of them off the
list so far let's look at the others the
ergonomics frankly they still suck the
big one because they didn't really
change so I could tell you guys just go
watch the original video to get our
thoughts on that but that's kind of
stupid so here's a summary it's heavy
and boxy which makes it dig into the
palm of your hand more than a more
rounded design and the fingerprint
sensor equipped lock button is flush
mounted making it difficult to find by
feel and even harder to access if you
use a case as for the camera well I
don't know it
probably better not a hundred percent
sure since we accidentally on purpose
kind of trashed our razor phone one when
we were installing liquid metal on its
processor but even if it was better than
the original razor phone that's about
like beating your six-year-old cousin in
a footrace compared to current non razor
phones the most charitable thing I can
say about it is that it sometimes
manages to capture an image that I would
describe as competent the issue is just
that at this price it draws comparisons
to true flagship phones like the iPhone
10s Macs and the Galaxy S nine plus it
just can't hold a candle to them I mean
there might be a candle there but that
bright point in the image it would be so
blown out it would be hard to tell I
mean razors camera app is at least a
little more fleshed out but it's still
laggy and it lacks features like
slow-motion face detection or anything
resembling manual control and the only
thing I can say in its defense there is
that the ROG phone's camera ain't great
either so at this point as you've
probably guessed this is not gonna
become my daily driver like its first
gen sibling it's just it's not
competitive especially not for the $800
price tag for $100 more the base model
ROG phone offers double the storage a
two to one screen aspect ratio and
always-on AMOLED display albeit at a
mere 90 Hertz versus 120 max a far
better camera app dual SIM card slots
and better overall performance plus it
includes an active cooler though you do
give up the superior ip67 water
resistance and a micro SD card slot on
that note the razor phone too has its
bright points it's still got an
excellent almost stock Android skin and
front firing stereo speakers with that
120 Hertz panel that is just so smooth
the problem is just that while people
like me can rank phones and talk about
their pros and cons you the end user can
only buy one and this just ain't it you
know what is it though D brand they're
just you know what they're just it
they're your source for awesome vinyl
skins and they've got skins for
everything laptops phones tablets
consoles controllers and more you can
pick a great phone you can pick a bad
phone and no matter what it is you can
make it just a little bit better with a
deep brown skin they use high-quality
authentic true textured 3m vinyl on
every product and they measure many
times to ensure they have a factory fit
for your device with unrivaled precision
not only do they look great but deep
brown skins also protect against
incidental scuffs and scratches and
their customer service robots are easy
