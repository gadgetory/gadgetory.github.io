is the asou ste s mini which i unboxed a
little while back it's a home server
unit from a soos it accepts two hard
drives but the one that I have comes by
default with one 500 gig drive so this
is gonna be a drive or well drive drive
installation or a storage upgrade tip
today so we're going to start by
removing the casing so I just undo these
two thumb screws at the back here one
and two the whole process is quite
simple I've already scoped it out even
though I haven't actually installed a
drive in it just yet the case slides off
just like pilot slides off just like
this okay so you just get a good grip on
it there slide it off alright from here
you need to remove only three screws and
it would really help if I have the right
bit in my screwdriver here so I'm just
gonna dump the bits out put in my slot
head and there we go
so just do this one up here they are
magnetic screws which is good news
because I also have a magnetic
screwdriver so that makes it easier to
keep track of them once you've taken
them out and then the second one and
then the third one is down here and then
you actually slide out almost the entire
internal guts of the Ts mini now the
reason that I am doing a hard drive
installation video before I actually do
any tips about home server or the TS
mini itself is that home server is not
terribly useful unless you've got
multiple hard drives because a big I
mean there's a bunch of stuff it does
but it's from my perspective it doesn't
really matter if you if you don't have
the data security that it can also
provide for you so here I have a hard
drive this is a 500 gig drive to go with
the 500 gig drive that is already
installed in the TS mini and so you just
grab your accessory box which I happen
to conveniently have here there's my
user's guide there's a bunch of other
stuff and here are the screws that I
will use to install this drive so just
put those there
okay these are slot as well I had just
kind of assumed
they would be phillips-head since I've
seen very very few hard drives in my
time that are mounted with slot head
screws so there you go you see something
new every day
so slot head screws are not really my
favorite they're a little harder to
maneuver into place than Phillips head
so bear with me here while I try to do
this with a camera strapped to my chest
you've got to put six of these on or at
least four so this may take a while
there we go I got one although it's not
in all the way yet so hard to line up
while he slips out of the way I don't
know how people do it like there's
entire industries that seem to use
nothing but slot head screwdriver screws
it's a pretty useless standard if you
ask me there's nothing that you can do
with a slot that you can't do with the
Robertson or I Phillips I mean I guess
if you need a whole ton of torque then
slot heads probably the only way to go
that I can't think of all that many
applications read these that much torque
okay I'm just gonna have to like turn
this off for a bit struggle with this
off-camera all right I got it that
really wasn't that hard when I'm not
trying to hold the camera at the same
time so I made it look very difficult
but it isn't so then all you do is you
slide the drive in you see there is a
SATA backplane there which runs off a
PCI Express 1x interface right here and
I'll show you how that fits into the TS
mini itself but basically all you do is
line up these screws with the rails that
are in there and then drop it in so this
lever right here lifts up if you want to
take the drive out and then it just
lifts itself up and then walks right
into place when you screw that when you
slide the drive in so now I have two
hard drives plug into this this
backplane here and I'm ready to put it
back in but I wanted to give you guys a
look at the inside of the TS mini one of
the things to note about the TS mini is
there are not any warranty void if
removed stickers when you take the thing
apart so it is designed to be opened up
by an end user and have hardware
installed in it so that's really
so here's a custom motherboard this is
the asou ste s mini mb WS so I guess
that's their workstation series and
we've got our Atom processor here a
chipset we have a PCIe 1x interface that
I mentioned before and then we have a
whole lot of connectivity here on the
back so we've got all six of those USB
ports 2 eSATA ports well that's
interesting
huh well I'll be look at that the TS
mini has a VGA port but it's not
accessible from the back so I like hold
on a minute we are discovering things
today so let me see there's I see
there's got to be a way to remove this
this back plastic piece so here okay
we're getting sidetracked today I'm
apologizing in advance for that but it's
something that has to be done we're
gonna go ahead and remove these these
are Phillips head yay so that'll go much
faster I feel like I can do Phillips
head with a camera strapped to myself
all day alright so one two three three
of those and let's see what happens if
we take this off do we get access to
that VGA port
cuz the whole thing slide the whole
thing slides off and we still don't have
access to the VGA port okay well maybe
there's some other trick involved here
that I am that is not readily apparent
to me let me just see oh I see there are
more screws somewhere but I don't see
how those help us just see what happens
if we push on this push this thing no no
that doesn't help interesting so I guess
in theory you could you could cut this
away and get access to it but I yeah the
plastic is thin over top of where the
VGA port is but you can't actually get
at it that's so interesting okay well I
guess if you were desperate if you
absolutely needed to get access to the
home server from from like a physical
display then then that would work but I
mean it is meant to be managed
completely remotely anyway so it's not
like it would be a concern for 99.99% of
situations but there you have it if you
were really that desperate you could
just rip this open and you could plug in
a VGA port yeah you can hear that so
this black thing is probably almost just
a sticker you can see it sticking on to
the port there behind it huh interesting
okay well anyway so when you slide the
now full of drives enclosure thing back
in you just line up the PCIe interface
with the PCIe slot inside like this and
then you just slide that in so it only
goes in one way
there you go then you put your three
screws back and these are slot again so
we'll see how this goes I actually found
it was a little bit easier to thread
them in by hand because they do have
ridges on the edges of them and then
tighten them with the screwdriver so
that might be the strategy that we use
here so yeah anyway without the
redundancy feature where it
automatically backs up your data
I don't believe home servers all that
useful so pretty much the first thing
you should do if you're not buying a
home server unit that already has two
hard drives in it is you should probably
grab another hard drive for it
I mean hard drives are so cheap these
days it's hardly even it's hardly even a
factor when you consider the data
security that set that's at stake so
there you have it that is how to upgrade
your hard drive in the assist es mini oh
I didn't even notice this look at this
this is actually see through you can see
my hand through so it's not actually
solid black I had no idea we are
learning all kinds of things on my video
blog today the unit gets quite a bit
heavier once you've installed an
additional hard drive in it as well so
thank you for checking out my guide on
upgrading the assist ts mini home server
to include a second hard drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
