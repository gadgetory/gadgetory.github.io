that's broken so fascinating hopefully
my microphone is working although I
don't know from oh good it's this one so
I'll probably wait to get started until
will actually join the live segment here
let's just get the the broadcaster going
let's get the bull hangout going over
here actually what I should really do is
I should load up the YouTube channel and
I've got a bunch of tweets coming in
already hello there Linus can i have a
shout out asks a deacon yeah he's from
malaysia sweet malaysia is cool I have
family in Malaysia sort of apparently I
have I have in-law family in Malaysia so
that sort of counts right I've been
moving this over and I'm gonna move so
guys I'm using a new video broadcasting
system tonight I was just using my
webcam for actually here let me Center
my webcam so that this doesn't drive me
crazy for the rest of the for the rest
of the broadcast here so I'm using
xsplit which is sort of neat because I
can do this and now you guys can
actually see the Twitter feed as as
things come in so I think that's pretty
cool I got myself a license for this
it's actually not that expensive so I
can just press a hotkey
and then I can switch between actually
here here check this out check this out
so this is the webcam built into my
notebook so you can see that it's pretty
clear which one we'd rather be using at
this point I can do like little
transitions and you guys can see the
Twitter feed
what mic am I using I'm using the mic
built into my headset here is there a
problem with it you guys should let me
know right away so that I can
potentially fix that if there's any kind
of an issue and Aamir's in california he
wants to know if he gets a shout out the
answer is Noemi are you doing a lot it's
bad quality we can't see the writing you
know what there's nothing I can do about
that for now
you'll just have to kind of take my
we're actually you know what I could
probably you know I could probably
change it here let's see if we can now
let's see if we can fix this up a little
bit here so let's take this one out
let's add a new screen region let's make
it just the top tweets maybe and let's
see if this is easier for you guys to
read actually know before we do that
before we do that we should maybe take
the browser and ctrl + plus a little bit
I'm sorry the quality is so bad in
future what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to be switching over to its it
called again bad thing twitch TV so I'm
going to be using twitch TV instead of
Google Hangouts on air it sounds like
there's a lot of advantages including
that I will be able to so you guys I'm
just sort of trying to trying to do this
right now and then we will sort of know
what's going on here there we go let's
try moving that around so I'm gonna
switch it to which TV which will allow
me to broadcast in HD let me know if
that's easier to read or if it's just
still terrible believe least the the
font size again sorry I'm not really
getting started with any Q&amp;amp;A yet here
just working on technical difficulties
this is gonna be happening for a while
you guys there's really nothing I can do
about it we're gonna be making a lot of
changes over the next level I'm really
hoping slicks gonna join us for the
livestream today he's actually we've got
a filming session tomorrow and he's
coming over to because he doesn't have a
car because he's some kind of homeless
person and so we're driving in tomorrow
together he wasn't able to make it today
so we have to we have to film on a
Saturday which sort of sucks but them's
the breaks someone's got to make videos
about you know GTX non-disclosure you
know whatever might be coming out at
some point or might not and I guess that
person's got to be me
okay let's see if this works this time
I've increased the font size as big as I
can realistically get and let's see if
that works for you guys here we good now
okay I'm getting tweets that say that's
a bit better lioness let's go ahead and
refresh those tweets and see if this
works I'm like super excited about this
whole this whole xsplit broadcaster
thing haha that works yes alright we
have success so I'm going to switch back
to my Google hangout really quick there
so I can actually see how many people
are tuned in so why don't we start doing
a little bit of Q&amp;amp;A and I will go back
to the connect tab here you guys can
sort of check that out with me assuming
that it'll ever actually load there we
go oh and now it's in the wrong spot
which just freakin figures herons if we
can play around with this looks amazing
Joseph you look amazing so that that is
all there is to say about it alright
here we go
CW go wants to know there we go CW go
wants to know what is the best upgrade
for a laptop besides an SSD well CW
great question the best upgrade for a
laptop is an SSD there isn't really a
whole lot else you can do to upgrade a
laptop I mean some notebooks do you use
MXM modules so you have potentially
upgradeable graphics but we're not going
to see any kind of widespread adoption
of that what I'm really excited about is
external Thunderbolt graphics cards then
we will be able to truly talk about you
know notebooks like this this HP right
here that are completely business-class
totally useless for gaming if they come
equipped with Thunderbolt all of a
sudden we're gonna be able to just plug
in an external Thunderbolt thing when we
get to our actual desktop you know in
your dorm or in your room or in your
house or whatever else the case may be
and you'll be able to run games almost
as well as a desktop because those
notebook processors some of the dual
cores especially are using the same
architecture with the same memory
bandwidth that the desktop ones are and
if you got a dual core they're gonna be
clocked quite high which for any game
other than a select few is
way more than enough anyway so I'm
really excited about that but right now
we don't have any options you can
upgrade your RAM but RAM is so cheap
these days you've got notebooks coming
with 8 or 16 gigs of RAM right out of
the box so what else can you really do
ok let's see if there's any other
questions we got right at the beginning
here that I can potentially answer ok
hue hue has a question so 120 mil plus
240 millimeter rad combo versus a single
360 for cooling an i7 920 okay number
one is that just a pool of CPU either of
those solutions are totally overkill
unless you want to use very quiet fans
now personally I'm a big fan of quiet
cooling so to cool a single CPU and a
single GPU I'm using a dual and a triple
and then I'm running at very very low
fan speeds I would personally go for the
single 360 just for the lower pressure
drop because the more bends you do in
your water cooling loop
the more the pressure is going to drop
the more your flow rate it's going to
reduce it doesn't make that big of a
difference to performance but if you
want to be getting the best and the best
of the best out of your system then go
for the single 360 and then if you
really want to get the best of the best
to add more radiators anyway because
more radiators is is always better to
NASA says it's still unreadable that
some people are saying that they can
read it so that's that's all I can
really do okay and I just accidentally
did that so let's go ahead and widen
that again 52 new interactions let's
have a look at some of these tweets so
guys don't be upset if I can't answer
every tweet on the live hangout here I'm
sorry but there's so many that it's
pretty hard for me to to get to them all
let's start more live Q&amp;amp;A love them
thank you Raina I'm gonna try and do
that actually I'm gonna try and have a
regularly scheduled time every week so
it'd be great if you guys give me some
feedback in terms of what you think
would be a good regularly scheduled time
because I think that would really help
people know when to tune in I've got a
lot of complaints that people didn't
know that I was doing a live stream and
they would have loved to have tuned in
but they weren't able to because they
didn't know about it
so I do announce them on Twitter I do
announce them on YouTube but not
everybody is like
glued to their phone like this like me
so it's yeah if we have a regularly
scheduled segment then I think it'll be
much easier BJ wants to know hey Linus
I've asked a few times already but you
know if the 7970 is better than the 79
set
