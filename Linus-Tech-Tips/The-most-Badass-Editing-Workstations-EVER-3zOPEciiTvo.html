almost three years since we filmed whole
room water cooling where we upgraded all
our editing workstations that means
we've been using the same base editing
workstations for almost three years
I mean they've served us well six core
extreme editions 32 gigs ran Titan
graphics cards all that good stuff but
come on baby it's 2017 it's time for an
upgrade so we're going to be moving to
the latest ten core extreme editions and
perhaps even more importantly RGB and to
help me I have enlisted a very special
guest my favorite Soviet Canadian Ivan
who is going to be helping me perform
these upgrades in place with the goal
being to hot-swap everybody's editing
workstations so we lose almost no
productivity will it work probably not
so if we miss any uploads you'll know
what happened but darn it we're going to
do our best let's go
so this is the part where he finds out
why he was brought in today
it's a build-off hmm do you have a
screwdriver what is that it's a
custom-made one of course it is yeah how
did I even ask
Wow it's really smooth mm-hmm
looks like it has all kinds of uses
mm-hmm I'm sorry I touched it you only
got half of the table don't touch my
side yeah that's me don't don't touch my
side don't yell at me we're not in a
relationship so in terms of motherboard
the choice was actually pretty
straightforward we were looking for
something based on a Seuss's x99
platform eight sticks of RAM support we
needed lots of PCI Express slots and we
wanted rock-solid stability so that's
why we went with this board versus the
more advancement oh right and it has an
RGB header the most important feature in
terms of processor well as you probably
notice this video was brought to you by
Intel so if you get to choose whatever
processor you want in Intel's lineup
come on you go with the 69 50 X so not
only are we getting faster individual
course compared to our existing 49 60
X's we are actually getting four more
processing cores so that means more
multitasking that means better
performance as we've measured before in
the past so if you wanted you could
actually check out a video that we did a
little while ago on the best possible
hardware setup for video encoding we get
more performance there and we get better
multitasking chill out man I'm the one
who should do Russian yeah you never
worked in the office back with us you
never wanted to oh what I hit
okay so what I could do is figure out
the orientation myself but thanks to the
side-by-side format of this build off
and the respect that I have for my
competitor I'm just going to jump right
in and do it the same way he did it see
he congratulate Smee for cheating isn't
he wonderful I know where she lives
Oh RGB oh oh advantage Linus because he
didn't spell out all the rules of
engagement well you're already married
get it get hey so in terms of the power
supply upgrade here we're actually going
from 750 watt 80 plus gold power
supplies that were sunny modular to
Corsairs hxi 850 watt power supplies one
of the big advantages here is that the
fan itself actually turns off when it's
not under a heavy load which means that
these systems will be extremely quiet at
least acoustically they're going to be
RGB so they're going to be their own
flavor of loud did you put in all four
screws on the radiator or all eight
neither sir and why you do this because
you taught me that way Ivan do not do
half a job ever
oh oh you know what you may have made a
mistake though your RGB fans will not be
visible from the outside then I might
have made a mistake
dun-dun-duh since this is the only thing
that's going to be lighting up the
inside of the case I actually do stick
with my decision because then at least
we'll have the inside of the case leaked
somehow as opposed to only having it
coming from the front fans which are
kind of further to the front arbitrary
rules are also arbitrary arbitrary it's
like you can't install the motherboard
until you install the AAA oh you can
install the AO until you stall the fans
you can install the fans until you
install the we got to create that fake
like that fake cooking show attention
where's the salt
see this is what I love about modern
cases that have the the middle kind of
nubbin thing going on there so you can
actually mount a motherboard and it'll
stay in place well enough for you to put
in the rest of the motherboard screws
while you look for the motherboard
screws where are my motherboard screws
oh thank you oh shoot
novice mistake man I got my eye oh
she'll stuck on one of my ports so I
have to pull the board out fortunately
I've only put in one screw no war shows
on there either no you don't need
washers on the radiator whoops the metal
if you don't my oh come on it's fine now
I have to flip my idiot orientation to
think my two hose will collide with your
friend I always run into trouble with my
hose colliding hallo
that's okay we've got lots of clean
terrible humor we don't need the dirty
terrible humor either the SATA cable in
your poker you just happy to see me
yeah if I was happy yeah yeah I could
this thing yeah see it's even a little
weeny one like we need like eeny weeny
but also ki Vorenus okay this is a trick
that I use but never recommend where you
just kind of line it up on the pins and
then you use the screwdriver did you
have a ton if you slip you hit your
motherboard with a screwdriver the build
on stun I won by ten minutes but given
that he's never built in the case before
I'd say that's kind of within you know
margin of error so it's going to come
down to which build you guys ultimately
think is better Ivan took a different
approach to the cabling at the back a
different approach to the cabling at the
front and opted to put the fans on the
inside to illuminate the motherboard
area rather than on the outside
and as for me I have my 24 pin cable
going up the cable management run I have
my my drive cable really not looking as
good back there I don't think I did as
good a job of these cables but I've got
my Thunderbolt 3 card installed so bonus
points for that they're all supposed to
have Thunderbolt 3 and 10 gig lan and
I've got my fans visible from the top
here so that I can have like dope
animated lighting effects like that of
course we had to build six of these
systems and I even did the other four
and he figures this is what he calls the
final form so what did you do
differently on this one right well
starting from the front I 2k extremely
neat approach to the bottom part of the
cabling see how everything snakes around
and is barely visible except for this
little Remo piece over here the other
thing is that I actually found where to
tuck away all of the extra cables
there's a cavity up here here so you can
see the back set is very clean and
finally I managed to stick all of the
thicker cables behind this protective
sheath and even cleaned up the bottom a
little bit still not perfectly happy
with the result but that's the key a
clean backside alright
so of course you guys aren't here just
for that but also performance so we
tested these systems a couple of
different ways first with the RGB
lighting mostly disabled the RAM is
still on but all the fans off so we
could get a baseline for how much of an
improvement we were looking at over our
previous systems and as you guys can see
it is pretty freaking huge whether we're
talking Cinebench whether we're talking
Adobe Media encoder going from 6 to 10
cores and faster cores with upgraded
graphics is a massive difference but and
that's without RGB flare so my system
here was actually tested a little bit
differently we turned on the RGB
lighting with some animations and
overclock the CPU to 4.2 gigahertz one
of which we're not sure if it was the
RGB or the overclocked allowed us to
achieve simply mind-boggling perform
it actually feels like this is an
upgrade over the three year old systems
in everything from video editing to
heavy multitasking to even gaming so
when it comes to the red footage that
we're working on now that we can swap
everybody's systems out now we're
looking at definite real usability
improvements over the old systems things
like timeline scrubbing are going to be
much faster on these systems than they
were on the old ones and I think that
pretty much wraps it up thank you guys
for coming along on this wild and
hopefully entertaining ride thank you to
Intel Asus and Corsair for hooking us up
with what we think are pretty much the
most ba editing workstations on the
planet and thanks to you guys for
watching see you next time oh yeah and
thanks to Ivan for being here and be
productive and that too so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you know where that button is but if you
liked it hit that like button get
