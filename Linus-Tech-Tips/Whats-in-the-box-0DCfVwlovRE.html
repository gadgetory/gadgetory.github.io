it's 2018 which means it is time for
another intel extreme rig challenge ah
mystery unboxing
now the thing that I can't really figure
out is uh what's gonna be in here
because normally when they send over
these there's like a product that I'm
already aware of that's launching look
at these things have you ever seen
something like this before I'm gonna
show off my dope
it tells then tells developed a clothing
line no way that's actually pretty nice
and it's a medium - no it's not okay
today kicks off Intel's third annual
extreme rig challenge as in previous
years Intel has given the chop system
builders one of their most extreme
processors and the fastest drive on the
market then set them free to build the
most powerful gaming rig imaginable once
again the public will decide the
competition so stage one each system
builder will post three videos across
the three stages including the following
key components stage 1 power chassis
power and motherboard stage 2 is the
core so this is the processor and
cooling system often that ends up being
one of the key ways that they
differentiate and then stage number 3 is
the gear so that two drives
RAM and peripherals so let's have a look
at the secret sauce that everyone will
be using right there front and center we
have the Intel Core I 979 ATX II Extreme
Edition this thing's 18 cores it's got a
max turbo boost of 4.2 gigahertz support
for quad channel memory 44 PCI Express
Lanes and of course it is an X series
unlocked processor also in here oh
there's all kinds of stuff in here this
three it's like a cake it's like a it's
like an ogre it's got layers all right
so let's have a bit of a closer look at
these bad boys so this is Intel's latest
and greatest 900p it is 480 gigs of what
is not normal SSD this instead of using
NAND flash uses
3d crosspoint octane memory so what that
means is not necessarily much faster
sequential reads and writes but much
much much lower latency for better
system responsiveness then for our
motherboard well this thing's got pretty
much everything and the kitchen sink
it's got support for nvidia sli it's got
what is in here I have never seen a
motherboard accessory box like this Oh
interesting it's like a GPU support
bracket and Wi-Fi dongle see like I said
it has everything quad channel memory
RGB lighting all up in its business
support for up to six PCI Express
expansion slots including 360 next ones
and up to 2 m dot 2 slots including this
vertical one here and then this guy
right here that's hidden underneath the
heat spreader ok cool great loot Linus
