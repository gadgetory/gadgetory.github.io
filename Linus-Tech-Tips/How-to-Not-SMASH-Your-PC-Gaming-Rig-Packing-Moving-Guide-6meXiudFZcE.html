this year we've teamed up with dreamhack
so there's gonna be a giant BYOC or
bring your own computer LAN party pretty
sweet but how can you safely be your CE
well today we're gonna show you guys and
really anyone else who wants to move
their computer around how to safely
transport a gaming rig whether you're
driving flying or even just shipping it
to yourself separately speaking of tips
you might want to consider using an
Origin PC you can customize your Origin
PC desktop with an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
graphics card and pair it with a g-sync
monitor for fast refresh rates learn
more at the link below first things
first
packing up a computer is a little bit
different than other objects because not
only do you have to protect the outside
don't want to dent in the top of your
case but you also have to protect the
insides and that's where we're gonna
start today inside your PC some parts
are at much higher risk than others take
for example the CPU cooler while a lower
profile cooler with a robust metal
mounting mechanism might not cause much
trouble at all top heavy cooler like
this one or a cooler that uses plastic
pushpins
even if it's not that heavy is liable to
either put a lot of torque on the
motherboard potentially bending or
breaking it or worse yet come detached
from the motherboard and shipping and
banging around inside your system I have
seen this it is not pretty so there's a
few ways that you can deal with the
cooler first is to avoid this situation
altogether by using an a IO water
cooling kit yes they can be expensive
and they don't always even cool your
system better but they are a safer
solution when it comes to transporting
your machine because most of their
weight is spread out and mount it to the
case rather than hanging off your CPU
socket option number two is to remove
your cool
all together before you transport it now
this is labor-intensive and remember
you're gonna have to reapply your
thermal paste when you put it all back
together but it definitely improves the
safety the third option is to keep the
cooler in place but to pack extra
material around it so that it can't move
under any circumstances and if it comes
off it won't be able to hit anything
I'll show you guys how to do that in
just a moment our next usual suspect is
the hard drive now these are actually
pretty freakin fragile because a lot of
the assemblies like the disks or the
spindle rely on highly precise
alignments where a deviation of even a
thousandth of an inch can kill your
drive not only that but shocks and
vibrations can actually cause the
recording heads to rattle against the
disks possibly scratching them if
mounted properly inside your case which
will then be in a box it's probably okay
to leave it in however if you want to be
extra cautious it can be a good idea to
take your hard drives out and carry them
with you or at the very least make sure
that you've backed up your important
data before leaving home other
vulnerable components in your tower
include really anything with an edge
connector but not all of them are
equally at risk with your RAM you can
usually feel pretty safe just by putting
a couple of zip ties around the outside
of the slot for it and for something
like a network card yes it fits into a
PCIe slot and it has the same number of
anchor points as a graphics card but
because it's light there's very little
risk of it coming out on the subject of
graphics cards these are a problem and
the reason is because they're heavy
they've got just two anchor points the
screw at the back and the slot on the
motherboard so as you can imagine it's
possible for these to even rip the
socket apart when the case gets dropped
like a courier is apt to do so the
safest course of action is to take it
out before transporting your rig but if
you're gonna do this and supplies to
your hard drive too you should really
in an anti-static bag this will prevent
electric charges from building up on
your device and potentially damaging the
circuitry
now if you've still got the static
shielding bag that came with your GPU or
your hard drive these are the best
alternatively you can use a polyethylene
anti-static bag
these ones are usually pink just keep in
mind that these are dissipative rather
than static shielding meaning that yes
they're effective at preventing the
build-up of static electricity as they
can't create or hold a charge but they
will not protect your electronics from a
direct static discharge like a shock
from rubbing your feet around on the
carpet
also if you do remove some parts from
your rig be sure to tie down any loose
cables so they aren't banging around or
scratching anything inside while they're
flailing around but by this point you're
probably thinking most system builders
like main gear origin PC obviously they
don't remove all the components before
shipping so how can we do what they do
safely well you basically just need to
stuff the inside of the system with
enough material that nothing inside of
it can shift so one thing that can help
you do that is these expanding foam
packs that once activated will expand to
fill your particular case they're pretty
cool but they're not the easiest to use
and they're definitely not the cheapest
option because most systems will require
more than one of them alternatively you
can scrounge for packing materials that
alternatively you can scrounge around
your house for any anti-static foam or
bubble wrap or other packing materials
it's certainly better than nothing
another pro tip is to cut up something
like a polyethylene pool noodle or take
really nice packing materials like this
that you can find and cut them up to
size this was actually a super pro tip
that we used to use that NCIX where we'd
kind of cut them to size and then wedge
them in so that nothing could really
move the idea is that even if the system
gets drop-kicked you don't want things
shifting too much because
once they gain momentum they can start
to gain leverage and wrench things apart
so for now we're done with the inside so
if you're driving to your next land
packing up the inside plus attaching a
neato carrying harness or something like
that might be all that you need to do
but if your PC is flying as checked
luggage or getting shipped on its own
you'll also need to protect the outside
now the most common recommendation is to
ship your PC in the box that the case
came with it's the right size and you
probably still have the original packing
foam that came with it but there are a
couple of things to keep in mind one is
that this box was designed to protect a
case not a case that was loaded up with
an extra 15 to 25 pounds of components
so it's definitely a good idea to put
this box inside another box too if your
case was shipped with soft foam like
this that could be reusable but if it
was shipped with a harder rigid style
foam like this stuff it could have been
spent by its original journey and like
bike helmets this stuff is designed to
take n impact not a bunch of impacts now
we've got to solve our last problem you
might have noticed in all of this that
there's no room for the monitor so for
that you'll either have to one use a
different outer box a larger one
although I don't necessarily recommend
that because your monitor just banging
around in there's not gonna be a good
time or two you'll have to ship it in a
separate box and once again here we
recommend using the original one
wherever possible with the same caveat
that depending on the type of foam that
was used it might not have its original
structural rigidity another fun option
is a lot of these kinds of events
actually have the option to rent a
monitor when you get to your destination
for example Dreamhack and quakecon
usually have both PCs and monitors for
rent but that's not an option at LTX
2019
so if you're choosing
one large box and you want to kind of
pack everything in there the most
important thing is to make sure that
it's big enough for all of your stuff
plus your padding but not so big that
you're paying for unnecessary size and
weight you also want to make sure that
you have enough packing material because
if there's any space for things to slide
around just like with the inside of the
PC you're going to have a pretty bad
time now for the inside of an outer box
you can use whatever cheapo packing
material you can find crumpled up
newspaper anything that you can pull out
of the garbage
that'll help absorb impacts without
adding too much weight taping up your
box you want to use two strips of
packing tape across the opening to
perpendicular to that and then a loop
around the edge just for added stability
repeat that on the other side and you're
set now the big question do you write
fragile this side up or computer on the
side well it's probably not going to
help you since most of the people who
handle boxes are moving so fast that
they don't have time to give your
package any special treatment and much
of the logistics chain is actually
automated so that unsympathetic robots
who can't read will likely be the ones
giving your box most of the abuse it's
worth a try we're just not gonna tell
you to get your hopes up speaking of
getting your hopes up I've got my hopes
up that with PIAA my true IP address
will be hidden and I will be able to
bypass your restrictions and censorship
it's not just hopes that's how it works
with PIAA you appear as though you are
some anonymous person connecting from
someplace else you can use pay ia with
up to five devices at once it's got an
internet kill switch if your VPN gets
disconnected involuntarily so you won't
accidentally leak any personal
information it includes mace P is
built-in malware blocker and it offers a
variety of levels of encryption that you
can fine tune to your heart's content
we've got apps for Windows Mac Android
iOS and even a Chrome extension and you
can check it out at LM GGG slash p IA
linus too so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribe hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description I don't put the expanding
foam thing in there yeah sure
okay cool also link from the description
is our merch store which has cool shirts
like the one I'm wearing and cool it
easily and our community forum which you
should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
