our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
the PA - for 9q is a true upgrade to the
two four six that means we've got a 10
bit panel improved electronics for even
closer Delta ease very very accurate
color and a wide wide range of colors
100% coverage of srgb and Adobe RGB 178
degree wide viewing angles so this is
using an IPS panel presumably one moment
I got the thumbs up right after we cut
that last shot so our shot logger is
gonna go ahead and take care of that
basically what this is is it addresses
that need from a Productivity standpoint
to have a higher than sixteen by nine
monitor because personally for me and I
know this is true for a lot of people
maybe not for watching movies but for
anything else
spreadsheets graphic design having those
extra pixels at the top and the bottom
really does help a lot just like the two
four six quick fit is here so that's the
button that you press that basically
puts little measurements all over the
screen that allows you to not have to
eyeball things ever ever again there's
even one for here we go if four-letter
pictures different pictures all that
kinds of good stuff and I can tell you
guys right now just subjectively
standing here looking at it holy crap
this thing is absolutely beautiful so I
think this is even a thinner bezel than
the last generation as well gorgeous and
there's also markings here for for
aligning things and measuring things as
well it's getting dark in here and it's
hard to see they walked away with this
before we had a chance to show it to you
but JJ is going to send us some footage
of this and we are going to talk about
it basically it's a is a 21 by 9 IPS 29
inch monitor with side by side
essentially side by side 17 inch
monitors it's basically two side by side
17 inches which is great for watching
movies in their full non black bard
glory great for productivity and because
you've got what is essentially a dual
monitor setup on a single stand it
connects with a single display connector
as well and you can even use the
software that's included with your
graphics card to create virtual displays
so that you can maximize things and JJ
wants to come on in come on into the
shot your your tell us forgot one
actually thing in this briefing is that
these new MX series monitors also have
our
sonic master audio technology the really
cool thing about that is we actually
have a really high-end integrated DAC
built into the actual speaker Wow so
actually for users that are looking to
have a consolidated monitor but I also
be able to have a high quality playback
experience maybe you don't have like
nicer and headphones you don't have to
channel desktop speakers you want to
keep things really aesthetically clean
nice but actually have some nice quality
sound that's been processed correctly
that's gonna be built in directly into
the panel so that's gonna be a nice plus
that's awesome there's an innovation we
need I mean as you guys know I love
higher-end audio solutions so onboard
audio on anything that doesn't suck is
always like two thumbs up over here we
have another really cool monitor so VG
series monitors we all know they're
fantastic for gaming this one takes the
cake
this one is fully nvidia 3d vision ready
so all that stuff is fine but check this
out one millisecond response time so
that means you won't see no matter how
closely you look at this any kind of
motion blur going on here and 144 hertz
refresh rate which basically means that
it is there's there's no input lag
there's stuff happening and then there's
you seeing the stuff happening as
clearly as possible it's LED backlit
it's 1080p yes it's a TN panel however
if you are more concerned with the speed
and responsiveness of your panel even if
you don't want to use stereoscopic 3d
you just want to run you want to take
that gtx 680 you bought you want to
actually run your game at 144 frames per
second and actually see every frame it's
drawing this is a solution for you yes
the colors are not going to be up there
with IPS or pls or some of those other
panel technologies but if you want that
extra extra edge then this is pretty
much the way to go don't forget to
