the length comparisons and the whatnots
so this is for the radeon HD 6990 which
as you guys may or may not know already
is one huge video card so it is exactly
one foot long pretty much pretty much
exactly yes that's the word I was
looking for okay which makes it 30 and a
half centimeters long from the PCI
backplate all the way to the very end so
this compares quite favorably with
probably only one other card the 5970
which is the same length however if we
take some other cards like the single
GPU 6970 which is just short of 11
inches long work our way down to the gtx
580 which is 10 and a half inches long
then down to the 6870 which is nine and
seven eighths inches long and then
finally I've got a gtx 460 hawk edition
here just for context so it's either
nine and a half inches long or stuck on
there nine and a half inches long which
the shroud or actually if you go by the
PCB it is only about eight and a half
inches long so that makes the 69 70 or
at 6990 rather sorry the 6990 one of the
largest cards ever made for the consumer
market it's also one of the heaviest
it's quite a heavy card although not
compared to the ax sous Aries for
example which is even heavier it's got a
shrouded backplate and yes it is quite
long so if we were to measure this in
terms of cat lengths say I got a cat
here eating my garbage hey please don't
eat that
see please nothing like garbage and eat
it okay come here cat con up hard check
grab cat won't have a camera hanging
around me there he is ok wat step there
ok so in terms of cat nights the 6990 is
approximately ok about a point 665 of a
cat so there you go that was my new unit
of measurement that I have invented and
that is my length video about the radeon
HD 6990 don't forget to subscribe to
