this is the 600 T now I know I have
already unboxed - 600 T before in the
past but this is a special 600 - this is
these 600 teeth white finish so we'll go
ahead and show you that I'm not lying
the white finish with window and neck
side panels that is not to say that
there's a window covered and mashed
eliminating the benefit of both of them
since you can't see through the mesh and
the window would effectively block an
airflow that the mesh would allow no
that is to say you have the option of
installing either a window or a mesh
side panel pretty cool so let's go ahead
and break the seals here 600 T has
proven itself to be very popular I mean
I'm sure otherwise Corsair wouldn't have
bothered releasing another color I
actually haven't seen the 600 T white in
person yet so I am definitely looking
forward to this business I really like
the functionality of the 600 T black and
the aesthetic of the white version
intrigues me
so I'm just gonna go ahead and show you
guys the way that it's packed in here
that I'm gonna dump this out off-camera
and I'll be back in a minute so it's
using a fairly soft so not super brittle
but also not closed cell foam to protect
your case however if you look at the
thickness of the foam check this out I
really wouldn't worry about anything
going wrong with this chassis in transit
I mean even if you have to ship it like
a couple times I really don't think
anything's gonna get damaged so nice big
shipping box you can see it's I using a
double layer so double to corrugated
layers here so it's very very strong
okay so I'm gonna dump this out I'll be
back in a second
alright so now that we've got it under
the packaging here's those giant pieces
of foam in case you care
some people do all right we've got a
dust cover here so we're gonna go ahead
and now we see that the case is upside
down so I'm going to have to flip it
over before continuing my unboxing there
we go so this is the corsair 600 t white
since I have already unboxed the 600 T
in the past I'm not going to focus too
much on no but I get it okay I was like
hmm so they offer a window and mesh side
panel options I don't see any other
accessories in here so what they've
actually done is they have tacked the
mesh side panel into a box inside the
case giving you the option to and it's
very easy to remove just undo these
screws put in your mesh side panel and
boom you're done so this is nice
actually they've taken a lot of steps to
make sure that they're doing a great job
of changing this case from black to
white so number one look at this they've
done not only the outside of the case
but also the inside of the case has been
completely finished in white
so they've powder-coated it which means
that all the little nooks and crannies
are completely white it has a very
striking finish because it looks kind of
like stormtrooper armor with the white
and black accents so let's go ahead on
you know I'll show you guys a quick tour
of the 600 T if you aren't already
familiar with it so you've got 8
expansion slot so you can support XL ATX
motherboards that have 8 expansion slots
but not 9 bear that in mind guys you got
your bottom mounted power supply you've
got six hard drive sliders that support
three and a half inch and two and a half
inch each you've got a front 230
millimeter fan top 230 millimeter fan
rear 120 millimeter fan which is
compatible with Corsair liquid cooling
systems such as the age 60 or H 80 all
the internal cables in Corsair tradition
are black so you don't have to worry
about sleeping them if you want a super
nice color
and build the five and a quarter inch
base or tooless I actually love their
Tula system it's really easy to use in
terms of included accessories we've got
screws and a couple cable ties okay
you've also got a key for it's a key for
it I have no idea okay I'll try and
figure out what that key is for a little
bit later I think you know I might have
even been trying to figure out what the
key was for the last time I did a 600
key unboxing and I probably figured it
out and then I forgot so on the top you
can remove this whole mesh thing right
here that gives you access to install
different fans so you can take out the
230 Mel
you can put in two 120 mils which will
give you the compatibility for our
radiator and there's your key so or
whatever reason that is what you might
need to open which would unlock the side
panel yes okay so that is your side
panel lock there's a latch right here
that closes on to this particular button
which will make it so that it won't be
able to closed which would open up the
case all right on the top you've got
your power and reset switches you've got
your integrated fan controller for USB
2.0 ports one USB 3 port which I believe
is enough actually one firewire port
headphone and microphone ports and then
on the front you've got your four five
and a quarter inch bays as well as your
front fan filter for that 230 mm fan
that is well in the front love the
overall look at this case I think the
white version is much more impressive
than the all-black version that it just
looks really clean I'm gonna step back
so you guys can see it and more even
lighting here on the back you find lots
of cable management features which were
accustomed to of course there cases at
this point almost to the point where we
take it for granted
huge CPU cutouts so no matter where your
socket is situated you're going to be
able to remove the backplate of your
cooler and install a new one without
removing your
they're bored nice soft grommets for
cable routing so you can take all your
cables from your power supply bring them
out here
route them to wherever they need to go
so you know video card eight pin CPU
connector you know your drives up here
you can route things over here you've
got a fair bit of space actually I've
got a ton of space between the side
panel of the case and the back of the
motherboard tray here so you can route
24 pin power connectors behind the CPU
motherboard or behind the motherboard
tray with no difficulty as I mentioned
before here while your front connectors
so those are all sleeved black for your
aesthetic convenience and satisfaction
and I think that's pretty much all I'm
going to say why don't you look at the
back because I haven't shown that yet
you can see that it used is vented PCI
covers for more airflow you've also got
water cooling holes because everyone
uses external water cooling units I
guess although I would definitely
recommend installing a dual rad in the
top and then a single in the back versus
running a triple outside here because
that will give you the same cooling
performance and it'll all be inside and
tidy you can pick up your whole case and
move it somewhere if you need to so
