content here at Computex 2018 check out
their hydro Series Pro liquid coolers at
the link below
alright so when we arrived in AMD's
batter no Hall or whatever whatever this
place is this demo frankly it sucked I
mean they were showing off their wraith
ripper or cooler which will be available
separately for their thread Ripper 2
CPUs it's got a 120 millimeter fan and I
mean really the notable thing here is
that it's a 32 core processor under
there and it's air-cooled but it didn't
even have any cables plugged into the
back and we couldn't we couldn't play
with it at all so I was like really you
guys I mean come on you know like come
on and they were like okay line is for
you so guess what we actually get to
show you guys not what it's called not
what speeds it's clocked at or anything
like that because this is still early
stages stuff but they are saying that
it's going to be twelve nanometer it's
gonna be up to 32 cores and 64 threads
but we don't know the exact other core
configurations that might be available
we do know that it's gonna have all the
same extra tech built into it as rise in
second generation so that includes their
new boost algorithm and all that kind of
stuff although when you don't know the
clock speeds then you can't know the
boost speed so performance is very much
TBD and what we also know is that it's
going to be TR for socket compatible and
a drop-in replacement for your ex 399
system with a BIOS update finally they
agreed to let us run blender on it so we
can see yes in fact this is real
hardware I think I hit the right hotkey
hold on f12 go yes so this is real
hardware 32 cores 64 threads so that is
4 by 8 times 2 and look at it rip so
this is a custom AMD seen you guys
aren't gonna be able to render this at
home and extrapolate the performance of
it because there's still a lot of work
to be done before this is released
sometime in q3 of this year but if you
guys were hoping for
you know AMD to one-up the 16 car
enthusiasts overclockable processor that
they showed off last year well then yeah
that's the plan
32 cores and yes it will also be
overclockable also of note is finally an
actual card so there's a Vega nano
follow-up to their previous nano card I
don't actually know too much about the
specs of this one I think it's like kind
of Vega 56 based 3d display ports HDMI
anyway what actually caught my eye
other than thread Ripper - of course it
was this see this like pile of laptops
and then like also this more laptops AMD
finally has a compelling enough mobile
CPU that they are winning a serious
number of designs with third-party
manufacturers let everyone from there's
a huawei unit on the other side they're
Dell oh this is interesting this is the
first ever AMD CPU in a Dell business
latitude notebook this one's a little
bit chunky and business√≠ this is the one
that really stood out to me this is the
HP Envy x-360 13 and it is a super slim
and yet fairly beefy little unit so you
got your USB over here you got your
cooling vent here micro SD it's man this
thing is crazy thin over here you've got
a volume rocker type-c and another USB a
and then of course because it's part of
their X 360 line you can convert it into
a tablet should you see fit now it goes
up to a risin 7 2700 you that is a quad
core 8 thread processor and it's Vega 10
graphics is apparently running at the
full 15 watt TDP of this chip so the
performance of it will actually be very
similar pretty much identical to its
14-inch and 15 inch brethren probably
the most notable thing about this is
that this notebook is an AMD exclusive
for years at the very best
got kind of a hopefully very similar
equivalent to the Intel unit but
apparently HP is so confident in this
design that they built a laptop right
around
AMD's product which is like I mean
thread Ripper is cool but this is where
a microchip processor makes real money
and takes real market share from their
competitor speaking of taking market
share from competitors Corsairs Hydra
Pro Series coolers are their quietest
ever they've added a quieter pump their
magnetic levitation bearing fans and a
brand new compact RGB pump head with
vibrant RGB lighting because you know
you can't have the quietest most high
performance gaming experience without
that RGB so check it out at the link in
the video description so thanks for
watching guys don't miss any of our
Computex coverage by making sure you're
subscribed and we will see you at the
next suite or booth or whatever which
way is it going which place is good no
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
