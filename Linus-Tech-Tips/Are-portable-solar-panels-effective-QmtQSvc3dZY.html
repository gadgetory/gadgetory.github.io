it is awesome too because it's just kind
of usually around during the day
especially in somewhere like Mexico
while we are right now well it can power
devices if you have solar panels
connected to them and it can power
cities if you have giant networks of
solar panels connected to them it can
also make it kind of hard to see which
is why I'm squinting from now until June
20 of 2016 you can pre-order the msi gtx
1070 founders edition through mass drop
learn more at the link in the video
description one thing that has gotten
rather popular lately is the advent of
solar panels for stuff like hiking or
solar panels for charging things like
small battery banks or your cell phone
7/8 watt 5 watt solar panels that claim
VL to charge your device that sounds
pretty cool and you see pictures of
people strapping them to their backpacks
and stuff and then going hiking through
the jungle how applicable is that how
well do those actually work that is the
sole reason why we came to Mexico ok
that's not necessarily true but it is
one of the things we'll be doing here
the first two solar panels I want to
introduce are the anchor 8 watt and the
all powers 8 watt they look actually
almost identical but there are some
minor differences
they both claim 8 watts at 5 volts and 1
amp so I might have limited knowledge
here but I don't think that's how that
works but oh well we'll test that later
on both of them have little cable loops
where you can attach carabiners or
something like that to attach it to your
bag both have little pouches where you
can manage things like maybe putting a
battery in and both have a tethered USB
port so that you can move them around
which is actually rather nice
neither of them feature a kickstand
neither of them feature a battery these
are pretty bone standard solar panels
the goal 0 offering is a 7 watt number
which closes using magnets which is
actually kind of nice has little loops
for carabiners comes with two carabiners
and has its pouch on the outside inside
pouch there is a 12 watt connection a
USB connection connection for their
guide 10 which is another device that
goal 0 offers and a chain
the input so that you can connect a
bunch of these together it also features
no battery no kickstand and claims that
it can charge your phone entirely in one
to two hours so we're going to see how
true that is
so when it comes to these solar panels
they have lots of warnings and notices
and whatnot on them telling you that
efficiency will be hampered if you have
a cloudy day if it's if it's not that
sunny if it's different various
conditions can affect if it's not tilted
towards the Sun well we're in Mexico
it's pretty obvious where the Sun is
there are very very few clouds I really
don't think that's going to be an issue
so let's see how well they stack up to
their claims so what I have here is a
USB amperage voltage tester that is
plugged into the unit and then hidden
under it because it's incredibly hard to
read in the Sun then it's about noon ish
and the Sun is right above us so I'm
just going to hold the solar panel
basically like this and try to read the
reader which will be below it and I'll
tell you guys the readout and then maybe
we'll try to get some footage of it but
that's going to be really difficult so
the all powers is the first one that I'm
testing and with a little bit of plus or
minus on both of these calculations it's
reading at about five-ish volts or 4.9
and it's reading at about point eight
five point nine amps the anchor solar
panel is running at about 0.9 amps and
about four point nine to five volts
unsurprisingly extremely similar to the
all powers 8 watt so the goal zero is a
little bit harder to read because the
connector is fixed into the body instead
of being on a tether but we're running
at about four point nine volts and
waiting for it to switch over about
point seven amps so night not quite as
strong as the other ones idle and I
noticed some key differences between the
goal zero panel and the anchor slash all
powers panels in between testing one
heads will notice that there's a much
more glossy finish on the goal zero and
a very much matte finish on the anchor
and all power solar panels also the line
density on the anchor and all power
panels is much higher than the goal zero
panel and the goal zero logo takes up
more space than the anchor and all
one so there's just overall more panel
and this big guy gets a solid 5 volts 1
amps in the Sun so what one is this one
I didn't introduce it well this is a 20
watt neck tech which looks like it's
basically built in the same place as the
all powers and anchor solar panels the
reason why I wanted to show this off is
the other smaller ones are often shown
off as hiking solar panels but in not
completely perfect conditions aren't
always that great so this one did
exactly 5 volts one app in the Sun which
a little weird considering it claims to
be a 20 watt panel my battery can take
1.7 amps but it's only outputting one
amp if it wanted to be 20 watts as far
as I can tell at five volts because of
USB 2.0 it should be 2 amps out of both
of its output ports because it has USB 1
and USB 2 well USB number one and USB
number two not USB version 1 USB really
do don't anybody anyways so a little bit
not stoked about the specs on all of
these guys although if I'm doing
something wrong in terms of calculations
let me know in the comments down below
but now let's test in the shade one of
the most commonly showing off scenarios
for these solar panels is just attaching
them to the back of your backpack and
going for a hike in the jungle or a
forest that's going to cast shade on
them for a huge percentage of the time
and they are almost never going to be at
an ideal angle so let's test that as
well what I'm doing is I stepped into
the shade just outside of the sunlight
and I have them vertical while the Sun
is directly above us this is not an
ideal position the crazy 20 watt that we
just tested is running at 5 volts which
is great kind of expected that and at
about 0.65 amps which is actually really
solid considering how it's positioned
that can probably be attributed to the
fact that it not only has a third solar
panel but it's also much larger per
solar panel than the other guys the
width is about the same but the height
has increased a very noticeable amount
this guy's much smaller standing in more
or less the same spot the goal zero
struggles to get to 0.1 of an amp
sometimes going to as low as point zero
eight sometimes going as high as 0.1 two
not very much you're going to struggle
to charge a lot of devices on this the
anchor doesn't fare all that much better
five volts just like all the rest of
them all the time its amperage goes at
about point one
five to 0.17 still a little bit sketchy
if you want to charge a lot of different
devices my cheero tough would reject all
of these the all power is yet again
proving that the anchor and the all
powers are probably more or less the
same thing having the same voltage and
save amperage as the anchor so our
camera is giving us a temperature
warning and to be completely honest I'm
done we've tested it in the Sun we've
tested in the shade we've tested
improper angles all that kind of stuff
I don't think brand ended up being a
huge factor here what ended up being a
huge factor here was surface area the
big massive one with three panels and a
taller overall design did quite well in
the shade and in the Sun the anchor and
the all powers which were more or less
the same performed more or less the same
and then the goal zero which had some
glassy panels which as far as I know
seems like a poor choice but I don't
design these things so I could be wrong
and had smaller overall panels didn't do
quite as well as the others fairly
straightforward one thing that I am
frustrated about is the math on this
kind of stuff maybe I just have no idea
what's going on in terms of solar
calculations you guys let me know on
Twitter at Luke on a scroll a hard go
there call me stupid let me know in the
comments down below but I don't
understand how five volts 1 amp equals 7
watts or 8 watts and how 5 volts 1 amp
and 5 volts 1 amp on one solar panel
equals 20 watts I have no idea how
that's supposed to work and we didn't
get those calculations here but we did
get here was like in ideal conditions 5
watts on all of them so yeah let me know
comments down below another thing that I
did find was that you're probably not
going to want to these 7 or 8 watt
panels I would recommend something like
the 20 watt panel at a minimum why
because the wattage number no because of
the three larger panels that were on
that charger giving you much more
dynamic positions that you can be and it
can be on your backpack at a not ideal
position and still charge a fair amount
off the Sun another thing to pay
attention to is what you're charging
certain devices aren't going to like
being charged at not one full amp I know
my cheero tuff is a little bit
particular about different things
because it wants to save the battery
that's inside which is a good thing for
a durable battery
and the slightly less scrupulous zero
ingress charger didn't care as much and
was able to charge off of all of them at
pretty much whatever amperage you threw
at it so pay attention what battery
you're pairing with these things get a
bigger better panel and I hope you guys
enjoyed the video to use the mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
don't speak to a robot get put through
directly to a person which is pretty
sweet and pay for only what you use the
average ting bill is only $24 a month
per device if you're stuck in a contract
and switch over to ting they'll cover
25% of your cancellation fee up to $75
head over to Linus ENCOM and try out
their savings calculator which can help
you figure out exactly how much you'll
save on your bill and when you sign up
we using our link you'll also get $25 in
service credit or $25 to a new device so
head over to Linus team comm and check
it out if you liked it stay subscribed
like it dislike it do whatever you want
buy a t-shirt not this one I guess well
you can but you want one of ours there
in the video description down below buy
some stuff on Amazon using our affiliate
code probably a bigger than seven or
eight watt solar panel and check out the
forum to discuss about how I probably
don't know math because all of the
companies did some weird math anyways
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
