just playing around the camera okay so
today we'll be unboxing the gigabyte 880
GM UD 2 H so this is this is a sticker
that's okay though it's six core CPU
ready out of the box it's part of AMD's
brand new 800 series chipsets so the 880
G is the replacement for the 785 G that
means it has onboard video as well as
excellent performance support for all
the latest CPUs all that good stuff but
you're gonna be missing little things
like say for example crossfire support
because it's not designed to be an
extreme gaming platform that said you do
have a lot of the other gigabyte
benefits with this board you've got
ultra durable three classic whatever
that means so that means you got a 2
ounce of copper PCB 50000 our Japanese
solid caps as well as dual BIOS it has a
three year warranty in US and Canada and
it features their easy energy saving
let's move around to the back did I
already mention it has support for the
Phenom 2 X 6 I think I did but either
way it's all good this is just more
details on the back about the
motherboard itself you got support for
up to ddr3 1866 ok you had lower EMI so
lower electromagnetic interference I
believe it stands for that means just
sort of less general electromagnetic
junk going on out of this board did you
know that that's what IO fields are for
it's to stop electromagnetic like
radiation from coming out the back of
the PC where you have a completely open
gap that's why all the PCI slots and the
IO shield is is covered with metal there
you go you learned something today
unless you already knew so it has an IO
shield it has a Dolby home theater
sticker it has 2 SATA cables one of
which is right angle and one of which is
straight as well as an IDE cable
personally I'd probably rather see four
SATA cables included but a lot of people
are still using IDE DVD drives so that's
what this is great for you got a couple
of hard drives I got a DVD Drive
you're covered next we have the user
manual and inside we will find the eight
series utility DVD don't use this
download the latest off the gigabyte
website and then you've got a full
English users manual covering a lot of
BIOS settings how to install drivers how
to plug in all of your front panel
connectors all of that good stuff then
we have a multilingual installation
guide book that covers the physical
installation in 300 million different
languages all right then we have the
motherboard itself so it's a pretty bear
accessory package although it is a
fairly low ition board so you now the
one thing that I do see is missing so
this is not using the latest Southbridge
from AMD it is using the latest 800
series Northbridge but it does not have
support for SATA 3 so you're still
running SATA 2 but honestly if you're
buying a value motherboard you're
probably not buying a SATA 3 SSD anyway
so I wouldn't worry too much about it
cameraman is having a look at gigabytes
pretty sweet-looking Northbridge
heatsink I really you know what now that
North bridges and South bridges for
example this one runs so cool I think
it's great that some of the
manufacturers are taking an opportunity
to make it more of a design element
rather than just focused on you know
oh here's the heatsink here's some fins
it cool is it really good because the
reality of it is and these tip sets runs
so cool you could probably put this
heatsink on that chipset and no heatsink
on this chip set and the board would
probably run just fine with a little bit
of airflow but instead gigabyte spends a
couple bucks they put a nice heatsink on
it it looks cool they put like a turbo
3d thing on it that's pretty cool too
why don't we have a look at the layout
of the board before I just start
rambling here so up at the top left we
have an 8 pin EPS connector so that is
going to be providing the power for your
CPU I'm surprised to see an 8 pin on a
value board like this but since you can
install 6 pin CPUs and presumably you
can overclock at least a little bit on a
board like this it's great to see that
guess the CPUs going to be pulling some
real power
next you've got your two sets of dual
channel ddr3 support so that's up to I
believe 16 gigs if I recall correctly
and four gig dims are finally getting
reasonably priced so you could actually
load this up with six cores and sixteen
dims in a micro ATX form factor I mean
Wow even a couple years ago that was
like impossible to fathom next we've got
a floppy connector as well as an IDE
connector your 24-pin power salong the
right-hand edge of the board exactly
where it belongs and then down at the
bottom right it seems like an odd number
we've got five say the two ports it's
not that odd because the six SATA 2 port
running off this chipset is actually at
the back of the board you got three USB
2.0 headers your front panel headers and
then as far as the layout of the slots
goes you've got one PCIe 1x slot a 16 X
slot and then 2 PCIe slots so if you're
running a dual slot graphics card it'll
sit right here in the middle and then
you'll have access to one PCI slot and
one PCIe 1x slot now one thing I do want
to comment on in this board is that if
you are running a dual slot graphics
card it's going to take up this whole
chunk of the board it's gonna cover up
three of your SATA slots I would have
liked to see that a little bit better
thought out but you can get around this
when you're ordering this board just
make sure you order at least one right
angle SATA cable so that you can just
kind of put it in under the video card
and you can get access to it that way
all right let's move around to the back
of the motherboard where we've got all
of our i/o connections so first of all
we've got a ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port then we have one two three four
five six USB 2.0 ports then we have DVI
HDMI and VGA out very handy we have
optical audio out firewire eSATA so
that's that six connector I was talking
about then we've got Gigabit Ethernet
and 7.1 audio thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the phantom X 6 ready 880
