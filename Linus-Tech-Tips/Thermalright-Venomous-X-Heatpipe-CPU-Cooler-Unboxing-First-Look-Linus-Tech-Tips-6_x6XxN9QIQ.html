look at a product that you probably
don't recognize because normally thermal
rate products come in a brown box but it
looks like they've gone away from their
completely boring packaging and they've
decided to go with a black box with
actual words on it other than just
thermal right okay but that's here too
obviously and then they've actually gone
with like a shiny venomous ex-green sort
of locally thing okay whatever this is a
CPU cooler it is for Intel socket 1366
1156 and 775 so it is completely up to
date in terms of the CPUs it supports
and this is the successor to the famous
or infamous or whatever it is the
legendary Ultra 120 extreme so this is
what thermal rate is saying is going to
beat it handily so let's have a look at
what is included in our accessory pack
first this is a nice box actually look
at home thermal raid on the inside it's
even black on the inside that looks that
looks great okay so accessories great it
comes in a nice little assembly package
look at that so it includes how exactly
does this work okay so it did include
you know what I'm not gonna bother
taking this out because I think it
should be pretty straightforward but
we've got one look actually maybe it's
not that straightforward I better take
this if I can figure out how this baggie
comes apart you know what let's pull out
the instructions and go from there oh I
have a nice excellent ok let's have a
look at the instructions first that
might make life simpler ok so here's how
it works you have a multiple support
backplate so that has 775 1156 and 1366
holes you put these thumb screws onto it
and then from there you install the
anchoring bracket mount okay and then
you have little er like thumb nuts that
go on to those screws that we applied
before so I guess that goes on top of
the board yeah yeah so these spacers
first so the backplate is alone then
these spacers then this is on top of the
spacers and then this holds it down and
then you use the pressure adjustable
mounting plate and this is one of the
big innovations they've made with the
venomous X because a lot of people were
able to
better performance out of the ultra 120
extreme by actually adjusting how tight
it mounted down on the CPU so now
they're just building that functionality
right in so you can adjust it okay and
then you use the standard thermal right
fan clips in order to mount the fan and
let's see yeah we've got a diagram right
here of exactly how all of that works so
you can see this is going to be the
motherboard surface here and then you've
got your little nuts and then you've got
your pulldown plate so it's all nice and
chrome and shiny on the top and then the
backplate is just a standard sort of
black alright and there's the the
adjustable knob for the mounting
pressure okay so let's keep moving
next we've got a thermal writing sticker
for your case or your wall or wherever
you want to put it next we've got an
assembly package now this is just
contents to make sure you can do a
double check before you get started that
everything is there oh they even include
a little wrench for tightening the
adjustable mounting pressure thing
that's pretty nice alright then we've
got a piece of foam and then we have the
coveted venomous X itself protected it's
a very nice box sorry I know I'm kind of
harping on the box but I approve okay so
they've changed the look of it a little
bit from the ultra 120 extreme first of
all okay the first thing I noticed is
that you've got little little jutting
out pieces of metal okay so that gives
you a little bit can you really tell
what it looks kind of weird but all it
is is it's a different shape from the
top down okay they've got the same thing
that they were doing before where the
one side tips up and the other side tips
down and I'm able Eve that is to create
more turbulence as the air is flowing
through the heatsink which means more
more prob more surface contact between
the heatsink and the air and more heat
exchange all right so let's have a look
from the side you can see what I mean
here where you can see that on this side
they point down and on this side they
point up okay
oh the cameraman is checking out these
six heat pipes that go down one side and
then up the other side and then the
thermal right logo that you've got on
the top Thermal rights never been about
like you know weird plastic shrouds or
anything like that they go with a simple
elegant look and I do really really like
it nice and shiny
we'll have a look at the other side
which basically looks like the first
side that we looked at okay so let's
keep moving on from there so there you
have it they've jammed as many heat
pipes as they realistically possibly can
into a smaller space as possible now we
don't have heat pipe direct touch with
this particular heat sink but personally
I've yet to see any evidence that that
actually improves things on its own
you're far better off with a with a well
engineered heat sink that doesn't
include heat pipe direct touch versus a
poorly engineered one that does and
remember too that not all heat pipes are
created equal Thermal right does use a
special gaseous liquidy substance inside
their heat pipes that other
manufacturers do not and they claim it
does help them conduct heat better so
let's do the obligatory finger shot here
you can see that is incredibly shiny
that's a mere finish you can see my hand
no matter how far back I move away if
you can yeah you can yeah you see that's
very shiny anyway thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the thermal right
venomous X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
