holding right now made it all the way
here to the show in a pelican case which
would have made this interview a lot
more awkward if it hadn't arrived in one
piece so we're here at the Pelican booth
where they're showing off some products
that are available some products that
are not yet available and I'd like you
to tell us a little bit about the vault
series which comes in a galaxy s3
version and an iphone 5 version and
these things look friggin rugged yeah
absolutely this is the iphone 5 version
this is our vault series of mobile line
protection this is our highest level of
protection that we've got as you can see
here it is Luminum grade protection on
the front as well as a plastic body on
the back these are actually held
together by stainless steel aircraft
grade steel screws and in between here
we've got a rubber gasket as well so
this is going to keep all the dirt and
the dust out from inside inside the case
in addition we went to the extra level
and added some water resistancy to this
case by adding a gore-tex membrane to
where all the speaker's ports are you
can still pop these put on these still
pop down so that's open already on the
way you can sit you still get full
access to all the ports as well and it's
still fully functional while it's on on
as well in addition we've added gorilla
glass to the camera ports for that added
protection this is actually going to be
available later this spring and will be
retailing for around seventy five eighty
dollars okay but that's not the only
mobile products you have on display here
there's an ipad mini model I asked to
see the ipad regular sized model so now
you can have that protection you can get
for your camera so what is this crush
proof is this one waterproof yes this is
actually crush proof dustproof and
watertight this is actually rated up to
three feet of water for 30 minutes this
is our hardback I
75 and as you can see it's actually like
a mobile workstation for your iPad
that's got a built-in kickstand as well
as a nice inlay for a for a portable
keyboard as well as inside here you can
keep all of your cords and cables and
other ipad accessories right here inside
and this folds up nicely and it also
includes a shoulder strap so you can
carry it with you this is currently
available in pelican progear calm and
retails for around ninety dollars
alright last thing guys they've actually
got a lineup of backpacks now so if you
wanted to transport things with a
pelican case but you don't actually want
to sort of lug it around behind you at a
trade show say for example this guy
right here is a regular backpack so you
can put stuff here stuff here stuffing
all the pouches and all that good stuff
but show us the Pelican case that's
integrated absolutely so what we've done
is we've integrated our Pelican
protective cases right into the backpack
so now it's the first Pelican case that
you can actually wear on so right here
this is our laptop series and as you can
see we've integrated the plastic design
case this is completely crush proof
dustproof and watertight like our
hardback cases this will hold up to a 15
inch laptop this latches and closes and
as Linus was saying it's got a multitude
of different pockets we've also
integrated a hard plastic shell on the
front which is great for carrying a
tablet nice and safely transportable
it's got a full size pouch here for
additional laptops and other storage I'd
like to show you guys something that
really stood out to me about it and that
is the here can I describe this that is
the spacers inside here check out the
density of the phone there so you can
you can reposition those in case your
laptop's a little bit smaller yep okay
well thank you I'll just one more thing
okay this is a very ergonomic design on
the back it's soft it's not going to be
heavy for when you got this loaded down
it's very load-bearing so it's very
comfortable to lug around with you and
for travel and everything he actually
showed us this before it's about this
it's about this thick between the
plastic back and the here we go and the
padded part itself so check that out so
there's actually a hard shell running
into how we've riveted this all in here
here's the hard shell yeah we see the
thickness check out the thickness here
guys so here I'll do my I'll do my
traditional iPhone size comparison so
you guys know exactly how thick that is
yep and these are currently available
right now on pelican progear com here
let me let me just put this baby on so
here we go I haven't actually tried it
yet so this is gonna be this is going to
be either an indictment of the product
or I'm gonna be or i'm gonna be super
impressed i mean the thing about a rigid
backpack any any hiking backpack is
always going to have something like a
metal spine in it so that it doesn't
shift around so that it doesn't poke
through at you so there's actually an
advantage inherently to having that hard
plastic shell regardless of whether you
want to keep a laptop or something else
in your backpack and now i can feel that
it's a little bit rigid however you can
see that because it's so much thicker
here it actually fits into the small of
your back right up against your spine so
there's kind of a there's kind of a
popped out piece right there that fits
right into the small of your back making
it more comfortable than just wearing a
soft back backpack thank you so much
this has been great and guys I hope you
