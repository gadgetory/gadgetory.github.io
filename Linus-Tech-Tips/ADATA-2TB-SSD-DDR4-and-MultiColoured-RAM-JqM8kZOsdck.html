brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital LDPC that might not
sound like much but it's one of the
features that is going to set apart the
SX 930 SSD and any other SSD product
that is based on the upcoming SandForce
third generation so this is the 3700
series controller so what LDPC refers to
is an enhanced error correction
algorithm that goes along with the
enhanced encryption as well as enhanced
performance and enhanced features
basically it's better in every possible
way they have a working sample here in
the suite but other than that we don't
know too much about it they are quoting
that it's capable of up to 1,800
megabytes per second of sustained
performance with incompressible data
something we're not really used to
seeing with a SandForce controller and
we also know that it natively supports
both SATA 3 interfaces as well as PCI
Express interfaces giving you the
flexibility to deploy it as a PCIe
add-in card or even in an M 2 or n GFF
type of form factor which can go
directly on a motherboard or in a small
form-factor notebook now this one right
here is a 2 terabyte model so we could
also be looking at some increased
capacity availability as well but what
we also know for certain is they're not
showing any performance numbers yet and
we could be looking at a few more months
before you can actually buy one of these
babies
not all futuristic SSD technology is all
about highest performance possible this
is the Xu 41 which is a full SSD built
into a single package here so it could
be soldered into something like a tablet
for example it's not necessarily the
highest performance in the world capable
about about 20,000 random i/o ops but
you get capacities up to 128 gigs and
significantly better performance than
you would be able to if you weren't
using a proper SSD controller in spite
of its extremely small form factor next
up we have is working ddr4 samples no
motherboard to put them in so you
but there they are we have both an 8 gig
and a 16 gig module to show you guys
this one right here has 288 pins it runs
at ddr4 2133 which isn't that impressive
for now we're expecting to see better by
the time it actually launches and that's
at CL 15 so the timings are quite loose
but there you have it guys it is working
apparently but of course we can't show
it working because motherboards
I've been saying for quite some time
that one of the ways that I personally
shop for PC components as long as I'm
buying from a trusted brand that has
good warranty support and all that stuff
is color so a data has attached to that
idea of pretty strongly here and they
have updated the XP gv2 memory module
kit line up to now contain many
different colors including some ones
that I'm particularly excited about such
as their matte black and matte white
spreaders but they also have some pretty
outlandish stuff as well so you can
match up to your build pretty much no
matter what your build happens to look
like so we've got a pretty sweet purple
anodized in win system and this is
actually the one that is running the
live demo of the ex SX 930 SSD featuring
that SandForce
3700 series controller I talked about
before guys don't miss any of our
coverage here at CES 2014 remember our
trip to the show is powered by NCI XCOM
your source for great technology
selection and service as well as course
our memory and Western Digital huge
thanks to those guys because without
them we wouldn't be able to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
