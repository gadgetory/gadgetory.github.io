why you might ask well it's because most
of them are complete garbage they're not
very clear they're difficult to apply
they make the screen feel weird and then
finally they come off it's a terrible
user experience and I don't use them
personally
in fact I've only done a screen
protector review once when I did a
real-world test of a product called
liquid armor which I continued to use to
this day by dragging a protective phone
and a dummy control phone down the
street behind my motorcycle this time
unfortunately I don't have anything so
extreme planned but what I do have is a
really impressive screen covering
product from a basically unheard of
Canadian company it's called phantom op
penta hourglass it's called phantom
glass and it's the first product since
liquid armor that has really gotten my
attention and made me think about
switching the flash voyager GTX USB 3
drive from Corsair provides SSD light
performance and fits comfortably in your
pocket click now to learn more all right
so what is it well in a nutshell you
know that super cool scratch resistant
Corning Gorilla Glass that you've got on
your phone and all likelihood well it's
a screen protector that's made of that
instead of some lame-o piece of plastic
that means it's flexible shatter
resistant scrape resistant only a phobic
so it's easy to wipe clean and it's
almost perfectly clear it won't hurt the
touchscreen performance and finally it
won't feel any different from the stock
glass other than raising the surface of
your phone a fraction of a millimeter
something that folks who like vinyl
wraps from companies like D brand might
actually find desirable because it'll be
more even but it gets better their claim
that I totally didn't believe is that
aside from being removable and reusable
it's super easy to apply and basically
impossible to get bubbles stuck in so
after the first step where you use the
included wipe to clean the surface of
the phone I peeled off the backing and
try to lay it down as gradually and
carefully as I possibly could because I
thought it would be really
hard to take off and reapply I ended up
not aligning it quite right and it turns
out it was both super easy to take off
and much easier to put on well then I
fought because I checked the
instructions when I did it the second
time I did two phones in a matter of
minutes once I figured it out you just
drop it right on the spot on the screen
and the bubbles like just work
themselves out uses some kind of silicon
nano adhesive nonsense to achieve all
this but all I know is damn it works
really well and once on it actually
stays equally impressive it is
noticeably thicker like I said
especially if you have a button that
comes through it like at the bottom of
an iPhone but the edges are smooth so
they're not harsh on your fingers or
anything like that and they won't peel
up even if you have a snug fitting case
I actually requested two versions of it
one for my One m8 daily driver and
another for my old iPhone 4 because I
wanted to test them this is the last
kind of miraculous claim that they're
making here I wanted to test their claim
that the adhesive coating actually fills
micro scratches in the glass on beat up
devices so this one I got one for just
because I wanted to have one for it this
is an over three year old phone that has
tons of micro scratches all over the
screen so I put it on after first trying
to kind of catch some of the scratches
in the light and after I did know it
doesn't fill in all the scratches but it
did make a visible difference many small
small scratches were filled in to the
point where I can't see them anymore
and some of the bigger ones well the
visibility is actually reduced so there
you go does what it says it is that's it
I guess one of the most positive reviews
I've ever given on this channel maybe
I'm a sellout and they slipped me a
couple hundreds maybe it's because I'm
biased towards my Canadian bro who
brought the product to market or maybe
it's because this truly is the first
screen protector product that has
impressed me in the last two years
because it's basically like putting
another identical skin of Corning's
awesome glass that I'd like a huge fan
of as an extra protective layer over top
of your original one I'll let you guys
decide what my motivation was here
speaking of deciding an easy decision
