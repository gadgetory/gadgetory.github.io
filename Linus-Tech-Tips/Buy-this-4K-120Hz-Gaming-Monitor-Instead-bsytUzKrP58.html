like four videos I think at this point
on our channel so you probably know how
amazing it's got a whole laundry list of
features some of which you might
actually care a lot about like a 4k
resolution screen 144 Hertz depending on
how you interpret that refresh rate and
I mean it's got some other stuff that
you might not care about HDR g-sync
professional-grade color accuracy and of
course what-have-you RGB lighting oh and
of course right it costs 2000 freaking
dollars but what if you could take away
the extra RGB cherries on top and just
get the stuff that you really care about
the 4k and the high refresh rate this my
friends is the wasabi mango which yes is
really what it's called
thank you Korea this is their UHD 430
it's a 43 inch 120 hertz 4k display for
over $500 less than this one over here
thermal takes view 71 case supports Mini
ITX micro ATX ATX and ATX motherboards
with a variety of mounting options for
your GPU and radiator check it out today
at the link below
so the wasabi mango UHD 430 believe it
or not was actually the first
commercially available monitor to take
full advantage of the DisplayPort 1.4
spec which means that over a single
cable it has enough bandwidth for the
displays 3840 by 2160 resolution at a
hundred and twenty Hertz without any
chroma subsampling so no it's not a
hundred and forty-four Hertz but
depending do you ask
neither is this one by the way you
should check out the full review for
this thing here it is it is pretty
freakin amazing so you might be
wondering if the UHD 430 came out first
why is this review only coming out now
that's because this thing is only
available for purchase in South Korea
but now thanks to enterprising exporters
you can actually get your very own in
North America on eBay for $1400 with
free international shipping that is a
full six hundred dollars cheaper than
the Asus and Acer offerings hold on a
second is 43 inches it does have
DisplayPort but it's this thing just a
TV with DisplayPort is it even any good
for gaming uh yeah that is like this
thing might kind of look like a TV like
look at this look at this stand here and
everything you might even kind of like
smell like a TV but it feels it games
like a gaming monitor I mean we
consistently saw impressively low input
lag and even the response times feel
great considering that this is an IPS
panel like there's barely any motion
blur to be seen on it now of course
going for a budget option can I call a
$1400 monitor budget I mean first there
is no variable refresh rate technology
no desync no free sync even
and since 4k games take a lot of pepper
to run well you're likely to be in the
40 to 60 FPS range when you're playing
triple-a titles even if you're running a
gtx 1080i or a Titan V like this machine
is actually and that's the exact frame
rate range where the most dramatic
effects a variable refresh rate can be
seen with that said your mileage may
vary depending on the games you play and
even how much you notice or care about
tearing or stuttering and that sort of
thing
also there is a chance that the UHD 430
will get a free sync support in the
future via a firmware update that's
actually the method that wasabi mango
used to upgrade their UHD 420 way back
in 2015
compromise number the next is the HDR
that yes there it is so it's on the box
and they claim it supports HDR but this
is one of those HDR int kind of displays
where it only reaches 400 nits peak
brightness true HDR really demands a
minimum of a thousand its peak
brightness and while we're at it we
should know that you can't get 120 Hertz
10 bit color and HDR turned on all at
the same time you actually need to turn
the refresh rate down to 98 Hertz to
really experience HDR otherwise the
bit-depth gets downgraded to 8-bit which
I mean on the subject of bit depths and
color accuracy well the AU Optronics
panel that is in the Asus PG 27 UQ and
the Acer X 27 is a quantum dot panel
giving it very accurate color over a
wide gamut this one well let's just say
it has good coverage of the sRGB color
space
I mean it is H IPs after all but then it
has what we would describe as Bork all
as far as DCI p3 coverage goes and
colors that are definitely not accurate
enough for any serious photo editors out
there let alone for five
I wouldn't edit a picture I took on my
phone on this thing quite frankly
looking at it side-by-side with a real
monitor finally and if you're into that
sort of thing
there's no RGB or glowing lights or
anything like that but at least the
chassis actually isn't half bad it does
have like a brush too anodized aluminum
face even if the bezels aren't super
skinny it's got a base amount compatible
back so you can put it on an arm if your
are wall mount if you're into that sort
of thing and it's got side accessible IO
with two DisplayPort 1.4 ports three
HDMI 2.0 ports and a Toslink optical
audio jack which you might actually use
since the included speakers while
definitely appreciated don't sound great
and aren't even loud enough for monitor
use let alone TV use so should you buy
this monitor I mean I guess if you've
got a powerful enough rig to actually
take advantage of 4k 120 Hertz and at
least some of your favorite games and
you really want to be an early adopter
then the five to six hundred ish dollar
price difference makes it easier to
justify not to mention that it is 16
inches bigger to boot though that does
mean that the pixel density drops from a
hundred and sixty-three pixels per inch
on this guy to about a hundred and four
on this one so you won't be sitting that
close anyway at least that is unless you
are playing one of those visual novels
that I definitely don't
about ting is the mobile carrier that
does service contracts a little
differently in the sense that there are
no contracts there's no overage fees or
any other carrier tricks like that you
just pay a fair price for the talk text
and data that you actually use every
month and ting gives you complete
control over your cell phone account you
can set alerts and caps for each device
on your account to keep your usage in
check nationwide LTE coverage means that
you'll have great coverage from coast to
coast and almost any phone will work
with ting from that ancient Motorola
RAZR sitting in your basement to the
latest Samsung Galaxy S 9 or iPhone 10
so check your phone's compatibility and
get 25 bucks off your bill or towards a
new phone at Linus dot ting dot-com
we're gonna have that linked below so
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or maybe check out the link to
