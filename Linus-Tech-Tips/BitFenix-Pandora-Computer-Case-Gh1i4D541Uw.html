the BitFenix pandora and i have a
love-hate relationship well it's an
inanimate object so I guess I have
love-hate feelings towards the pandora
starting with the outside you have on
one hand beautifully brushed aluminum
side panels with a tastefully sized and
shaped window depending on if you spring
for the window model or not on the other
hand you have the same side panels but
they pick up dust like crazy are really
hard to clean will show fingerprints
boldly and permanently if you don't
handle them and clean them properly and
also they happen to wrap around the
front of the case which hoses an
extremely glossy front panel which will
yet again pick up fingerprints dust and
in general just pick up imperfections
very easily but also happens to look
pretty damn cool if you keep it
perfectly clean next up we have the
screen in front of the case called the
BitFenix icon and know the love-hate
doesn't end here installation is easy
enough you plug it into a USB header
extract the application to wherever you
want and drag and drop photos with a
canvas size of 240 by 320 on top of it
the screen supports transparencies and
if you have a charging USB header that
allows power to pass through even when
the computer is off the screen will be
able to illuminate itself so it can use
its local memory to display the picture
that we put on it at all times like
we're doing here but it didn't work at
first it turned out that we had a bad
unit inside of our first case and
swapping it made it work perfectly but
troubleshooting was more difficult than
it needed to be because the application
has no GUI or error codes and there
doesn't even seem to be a manual
included with the case or posted on
their website it was pretty frustrating
and it doesn't stop there unfortunately
back to the side panels we have a ball
and socket pressure mounting system
thing yeah you heard that right and just
for reference friends don't let friends
who work at case design companies design
cases with balance
get mounted side panels doesn't seem
that horrible at first I mean it's no
big deal just to push the side panel
into the case and it stays there right
cool right in theory yes but in practice
the left side panel is a bit challenging
to install without using gloves or
something covering your hands and
immediately cleaning it afterwards but
where things really start to go off the
rails is with the right side panel which
also brings us to our first look inside
the case removing this side panel is
easy enough but the problem is putting
it back on due to extremely restricted
space behind the motherboard tray if you
were to do a lackluster job of cable
management you might not be able to get
this panel on at all this is the first
case in quite a while that I have found
the use of zap straps to be an absolute
undeniable requirement especially if you
actually want to have side panels on
your computer while we're back here
behind the sign panel is also an SSD
mounting point which while it is a
little bit hard to plug the SATA power
into due to available space is actually
pretty handy spot to mount an SSD
shifting our focus up to the top of the
case we are greeted by a power and reset
button which would probably actually
more consistently with stabilizer bars
like in the space bar of a keyboard if
you were to press too far from the
middle in any direction the button will
move a little but not actually go far
enough to trigger this switch between
these two buttons we will find audio
jacks and dual USB 3.0 ports the rest of
the top of the case is dominated by a
large fan filter which is easily removed
by pressing down on the two clip mounts
mine is especially easy to remove as one
of the clip mounts was damaged out of
the box resulting in only needing to
press down one of the clip mounts yay
luckily once the broken clip mount
decided to fall out completely the
filter set flush with the case so it was
at least not aesthetically I'm pleased
another's fan filter you'll find
mounting spots for a 120 millimeter fan
and oddly enough a three and a half inch
hard drive the hard drive mount features
nice rubber feet as vibration dampeners
and is actually pretty nifty spot to
mount your storage device although I do
find it a little annoying that they
didn't provide an option to mount it in
the other direction as it is currently
orientated the cables will likely go
through the middle of your case unless
you happen to have very long SATA and
very long SATA power
Abel's and that power cable needs only
have one SATA power plug on it due to
space constraints under the hood if
they're able to turn the hard drive
around then the cables could have easily
been managed but unfortunately that
wasn't the case finally we come to the
main compartment the SSD mount on the
side of the cable management box is
stylish and easy to install the hard
drive mount under the cable management
box is easy enough to install although
it is a little bit weird that you'll
have to flip the case either upside down
or onto its side to access the screw
holes which are fixed into the bottom of
the case said cable management box is
actually quite effective at providing
you enough space to hook in modular
cables into your power supply while
hiding your main compartment cable
clutter which you will have due to lack
of behind motherboard cable management
space it also sports some rubber
grommets at the top which I expect
mainly to be used for things like
expansion card power cables and
motherboard headers I would have liked
to see them implement these rubber
grommets on the motherboard tray as well
in order to hide some of the rest of
that cable clutter in the back the
expansion card slots are accessible
although the tower framing can actually
get in the way sometimes especially if
you have thicker fingers and while I
appreciate the fact that this piece is
removable it honestly seems easier just
to awkwardly try to install things by
working around the framing rather than
removing it entirely it should be noted
though that line has had an easier time
with this with his smaller hands up in
the front you'll find two 120 millimeter
fan mounts with a surprisingly ample
supply of fresh air from the ventilation
holes that are hidden by the curved
aluminum where you can easily install a
double rad by screwing it in by removing
the front panel this combined with a top
120 millimeter fan gives the case
compatibility of housing some
surprisingly powerful hardware in
conclusion do I hate this case honestly
no I'd not at all it's flawed but it's
beautiful and once you manage to get it
built and cleaned up you'll probably
find yourself asking was it worth the
effort I think you'll agree with Linus
and I when we say actually yeah it will
look fantastic in pretty much any
environment the front facing icon screen
is pretty damn cool and you can do tons
with it from displaying your company
logo if it's a customer facing PC to
showing off the icon of your favorite
internet group
it's compact and thin and while I can
gripe about the lack of space behind the
motherboard all I want when all is said
and done I understand the compromise the
designers made here because the width of
the case suits it very well and they
went with a philosophy that I hope more
case designers will adopt they didn't
try to cram 8 hard drive bays into a
case that obviously didn't need it and
instead they used what little space they
had as efficiently as possible when all
said and done I feel like a slightly
disappointed father the case had so much
potential but much of it was
overshadowed by imperfections lack of
attention to detail and for our review
sample at least several out-of-the-box
defects hopefully pandora 2 will be
everything I could have wanted and if it
Phoenix addresses the issues I brought
up in this video I think it will be
