at a pretty unique power supply now I'm
not going to cover this in quite as much
detail as I normally would because we've
actually done a full tech tips episode
on it in the past which you can check
out by clicking the little bubble ok so
we're breaking the seal here this is the
CP 850 and what is unique about this
particular power supply unit is that it
is not an ATX standard power supply so
this is a semi modular power supply and
I say that because it's a modular power
supply that actually has a lot of
connectors hardwired to it so it comes
with a power for it comes with a product
overview manual thingy here there tells
you all your different connectors and
all that good stuff ok then it comes
with a baggie of modular cables so let's
have a look at which modular cables we
have included with this power supply
quite a few actually ok we got another
another tie here and do ok so we have to
do to do a couple PCI Express six pins
we've got two different SATA connectors
ok each with three SATA connectors on it
and then we have a couple of molex ones
ok so those each have three molex ok so
those are our modular power supply
cables then on the psu itself ok I've
got a little high I hate these reusable
zip tie things like impossible to take
off in any sort of timely fashion ok
there we go so attached to the power
supply itself we have a couple more pci
express so these are six plus two pin
then we have three molex and three sita
and then we also have a 4-pin an 8-pin
eps and a 24-pin now let's have a look
at the powerSat self because that is the
interesting thing about the cpa 50 that
it is a completely non standard size
power supply
this thing is like huge in a way that
even a large power supply is not huge I
mean look at my hand on the back of this
thing so you can actually see it's got
to pcbs inside for two completely
separately wired up power supplies sort
of segments and the reason for that is
that that way antec is able to build
down from the top and up from the bottom
which gives much better cooling from the
120 millimeter fan that's on the other
end of the unit now you can see why I
call it semi modular here because you've
got a lot of attached cables and then
you've only got two more peripheral
cables so you can do two more molex to
more say no or one of each and then two
more PCI Express connectors on the
modular interface so it's not a whole
lot of modularity now in terms of output
it is an 850 watt power supply and
you've got to do 4 12 volt rails each
capable of 22 22 25 and 25 amps
respectively so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and product overview of
the CP 850 power supply and there are
some screws to there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
