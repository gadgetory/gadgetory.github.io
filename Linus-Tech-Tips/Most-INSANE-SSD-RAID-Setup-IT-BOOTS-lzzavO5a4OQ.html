year was about removing the bottlenecks
from high speed MDOT to nvme SSDs pretty
much every motherboard was bristling
with mounts and partners like a soos
even showed off this crazy card that
could hold four drives at a time for a
theoretical 16 gigabytes per second of
throughput so when Samsung approached us
to sponsor a video showing off their
flagship 960 Pro we had plenty of
inspiration for how to build the
awesomest dream SSD raid setup
unfortunately getting it to actually
work has been well an adventure yeah
now as the de facto choice for Speed
Freaks for the entire past year
Samsung's 960 pro needs no introduction
but they sponsored this video so we're
gonna do it anyway each of our four
drives has 512 gigs of v-nand storage is
rated to a blazing fast 3,500 megabytes
per second reads and 2100 megabytes per
second writes has a custom 5 core
Samsung processor onboard and a
five-year warranty
and somehow the whole thing is the size
of a stick of gum so then let's go let's
plug them all in and rip up some
benchmark scores right wrong finding a
board with enough slots was the first
challenge we had to solve I thought I
saw one at Computex that had 5 but that
turned out to be a figment of my
imagination so we settled Ben on the
asus prime x $2.99 deluxe with a
separate PCI Express card to handle the
last m2 but one small problem as cool as
it is to run Windows software raid 4 eye
watering sequential performance numbers
that has been done to death and besides
we wanted to actually experience the
speed in day-to-day use so that means
that we need to boot windows from our
array let's talk about intel's virtual
raid on CPU or vrock since the latest
skylake x high-end desktop processors
share much of their pedigree with server
level xeon chips they actually have
three what are called volume management
devices built in each of which can give
up to four PCIe 4x devices direct access
to the CPU for high bandwidth low
latency performance cool the issue
though is that today is not yet
officially launched and making matters
worse Intel is rumored to be planning to
enable the feature with a hardware key
that will only be available through
bundles with X to 99 motherboards or
SSDs thankfully though AMD decided to
ride in on a white steed and save the
day by announcing a free driver update
and sadly yes their marketing materials
specifically emphasized the free part
that's the world we live in now which
would enable bootable nvme raid on the X
399 thread Ripper platform
so a quick swap to the Asus zenith
extreme and we are ready to cry on the
desk because AMD pulled the software
almost immediately after the
announcement due to compatibility issues
once it was finally re-released we then
had to bundle our way through the
incredibly poorly documented process of
a loading the AMD nvme controller driver
which allows B the AMD rate controller
driver to be installed which allows C
the AMD raid configuration to be
installed then even when we were in
Windows running on four SSDs we hit
another roadblock our Iometer benchmark
results were nowhere near what AMD
posted on their blog so after still more
research mad props to Gary from asus by
the way man we figured out that because
of thread Ripper CPU is technically two
separate dies linked by AMD's infinity
fabric interconnect considerations must
be made to ensure that the nvme load is
balanced between the dies otherwise this
11 gigabyte per second link as fast as
it is could actually become a bottleneck
so armed with a detailed diagram of PCIe
Lane allocations and a pre-release bios
we pushed onward meanwhile though we
actually hadn't given up entirely on
vrock now while I wouldn't recommend
getting your Intel drivers from Russian
download mirrors
did find one that claimed to enable
vrock without a raid key and actually it
technically worked but our performance
numbers were way off compared to the
guys at PC perspective who also got
vrock working via what we think was a
similar method and anyway neither of us
could get it to boot with non Intel SSDs
so back to AMD thread Ripper then which
for better or for worse has bootable
raid today
AMD got back to us with a preset for
Iometer and some guidance to help us
replicate their results not while
actually booted from it mind you but
with a raw as an unformatted file system
and we implemented everything meaning
that it is finally time to do this so
after physically balancing the for
samsung 960 pros between the dies using
a Seuss's dim dot 2 for two of them and
they're hyper m dot 2 x16 card for the
other two we booted in pure UEFI mode
and configured our array using the
built-in raid expert 2 utility we then
f6 to all three drivers in order and saw
our two terabyte array as available for
OS installation once booted into Windows
we launch diameter with one megabyte
reads and writes at 32 Q depth and had
to rub our eyes at the results 12
gigabytes per second on reads and 7.3
gigabytes per second on writes and that
is without AMD's BS bra filesystem stuff
we are talking a fully operational NTFS
formatted bootable array with those
kinds of numbers for comparison a single
960 Pro delivered three and a half
gigabytes per second on reads and two
gigabytes per second on writes in the
same machine now crystal disk mark
didn't scale quite as well on reads but
we do have to keep in mind that this
technology is still in its infancy at
least on the driver side and we might
actually see more of the raw hardware's
potential unlocked in the future so
thanks to Samsung for sponsoring this X
raishin of high-end bootable raid on the
desktop I don't think this crazy ride is
quite over yet but we're gonna take a
little breather and then maybe we'll
revisit it once things have settled down
particularly on the Intel side over the
next few months so thanks you guys for

can hit that button but if you liked it
hit like get subscribed maybe consider
