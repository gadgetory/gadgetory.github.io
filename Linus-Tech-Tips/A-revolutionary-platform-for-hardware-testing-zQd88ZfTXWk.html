benches I have always loved the idea of
them but usually to put it bluntly
they're just kind of I've tried to
overcome this fact I even found one that
I didn't hate as much as the others
you've probably never heard of it
they're called Spotswood taxations
they're yeah they're pretty obscure and
even resolve to use it from my personal
computer but that was a bad idea the
bench wasn't that great and in the end
we all knew it but I don't think I fully
gave up until a while later when I made
a video on how to make your own test
bench in under two hours for almost
nothing that ended up being nearly as
good as what was on the market kind of
depressing
so when HW BOTS approached me about
checking out the open bench table I was
a little apprehensive it wasn't cheap
and I was worried its features would
turn out to be gimmicks but I gave it a
shot anyways because if anyone is going
to have a chance at getting a test bench
right it was going to be competitive
overclockers let's see how they did
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tamil
bear for free check the link in the
video description the first thing that
jumps out at you when you start working
with the bench is the build quality of
everything from the heavy-duty al 50/50
to aluminum body to the SS 304 steel
screws no punches were pulled when it
came to build quality which is great as
long as you can stomach the 150 US
dollar price tag which rivals some
pretty wicked mid tower cases that have
like side panels and front panels and
rear pay you get the point but this is
cool
if you don't want to shell out that kind
of dough and have access to a CNC
machine say at your school or workplace
or something like that then there is an
alternative it's called the open bench
table for more than just the fact that
it's open to the air it's open source as
well meaning that they welcome PC
enthusiasts modifying building and
making their own versions of their
published design ok great but should you
care
let's talk features first off it's
portable the legs are the stands along
with all the other mounts they fold
within the main body allowing it to be
flat packed and then it features a
handle on one end making it a breeze to
move around second when you get to where
you're going you'll immediately notice
the completely tool list design of
everything all of the screws that you'll
need are cleverly stored in metal
components or on the side of the bench
and they're all thumb screws that even
straight from the factory are loose
enough that you can legitimately remove
them without fetching any tools at all
although I would recommend whipping out
a screwdriver just to make sure that
certain things are absolutely secure
while actually building your computer
and there's more than just screws built
in literally everything you need is here
like your expansion card standoffs which
works surprisingly well considering the
issues that I've had with very similar
designs in the past where they would
like wobble and fail though you may have
some issues trying to plug in
by cables like HDMI or DisplayPort or
whatever else this is due to the need
for them to be non-flat it's not that
hard to avoid however if you're
comfortable with just one standoff per
card just remove the top one
speaking of standoffs you have your
choice when mounting your motherboard of
pin-based screwless standoffs and a more
standard system I opted to go for a mix
mostly made up of screwless standoffs
with a couple more traditional ones just
in case I want to lock things down with
screws and whatnot I love this because
ease of use is very important when it
comes to a test bench and not needing to
screw things in in this case is
paramount onto Drive mounting for me at
least this isn't all that important on a
test bench I tend to just let them free
ball since SSDs aren't much of a risk
from an accidental bump or even a fall
to be completely honest but this time I
install both the SSD and an extra hard
drive directly onto the bench almost
entirely because it just looked so damn
cool like seemingly everything else on
this bench when you're done installing
all your Hardware it's time to do the
often dreaded task of cable management
you'll be happy to know however that
there are holes left behind when you
remove the various components like the
little arms for the radiator that attach
it to the side of your bench and a
surprisingly sturdy and attractive way
but why are these holes a good thing
well if you just grab some velcro straps
you can use them as cable management
loops to keep everything absolutely tidy
so you end up with what is in my opinion
a very attractive mix of revealing the
work that you put into it while still
looking beautiful
so it's portable it assembles and
disassembles elegantly it looks freakin
amazing and it's sturdy all around
what's not to love well despite how
awesome it is not everyone is going to
want to or be able to fork over a
hundred and fifty dollars for a test
bench regardless I absolutely love it
and it will be replacing my old work
test bench that I've been using since
2011 but with that said even I don't
know if I could justify the cost for a
personal purchase especially with the
current
of the Canadian dollar what do you guys
think let me know down below ting is the
mobile carrier that is focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first you don't have to
speak to a robot if you call in you get
put directly to a person and you pay for

stuck in a contract and switch over to
ting they will cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks they are
now lowering mobile data rates across
the board and data is now just $10 per
gigabyte beyond the first gigabyte every
10 customer will be able to reap the
benefits of this new change which is
awesome so head over to line astark tang
calm and try out their savings
calculator when you sign up at our link
you'll also get $25 and service credit
or $25 towards a new device thanks for
watching guys this video sucked you know
what to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit the like button or check
out the link to where to buy it or other
test benches on Amazon because I don't
know if this one's on Amazon and all the
other ones suck also link the
description is the merch store we can
buy cool shirts like this and our
community forum where you can like
discuss things and stuff now that you're
done doing all that watch this video
which is where I DIY a test bench that
isn't as good as this one
but it's still pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
