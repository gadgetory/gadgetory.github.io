going to be captured with the Microsoft
LifeCam HD 5000 and I'm going to be
unboxing the Arctic cooling freezer
extreme revision - and so yeah this is
meant to be two things an unboxing of
this particular heatsink as well as an
example of what kind of video quality
you can expect from the Microsoft
LifeCam that I unboxed a little while
ago so you can see it is pretty clear
and we're gonna see how well it does
with the close-ups because the lighting
a isn't great in my office and B I have
these screens behind me which makes it
really difficult for even a good camera
to focus and and get good focusing image
quality okay
so let's unbox this heatsink this is the
freezer extreme Rev - it's like the
freezer extreme accepter vision - it has
excellent compatibility so it supports
pretty much everything out there 1366
1156 775 so that's all the Intel sockets
at the moment and then support for a.m.
3:00 a.m. - plus an AM - which are all
the same as well as 939 it still
includes support for socket 939 which is
pretty ancient at this point all right
so we got unmatched cooling performance
as a feature unique twin tower it's not
so unique anymore lots of coolers are
using the twin towers effective heat
dissipation via eight heat pipes that's
pretty good patented fan holders
eliminate buzzing sounds the voltage
regulators and Northbridge cooling oh
yeah we can talk about that in a minute
okay pre-applied mx2 so it comes with a
very high quality pre applied thermal
compound that's huge
because you can get the best cooler in
the world if it comes with crappy
thermal compound you're gonna get crappy
performance alright next we have the
only compared against the stock cooler
so cooling performance as well as noise
okay they give you some dimensions here
so the fan runs it anywhere from 800 to
1500 rpm and it is a pwm fan and I think
that's pretty much all I want to say
about the outside of the package so why
don't we get this thing opened up and
have a look-see so the first thing we
find inside is a piece of paper and that
piece of paper has some writing on it in
a couple different languages
okay so let's go to English because
that's what I speak okay step one remove
the fan press the fan shoulders to
unlock the fan and lift the fan upwards
step two so we've got six steps on this
side and then seven steps for Intel and
then five steps for a and B so AMD looks
to be a little bit simpler okay okay so
we've got a little bag deal of this is
Intel and it has two screws in it okay
and then the next thing we have is what
appears to be AMD mounting clips as well
as some little like I don't know what
those are shaped like but there they are
okay next we have the cooler itself wow
that was pretty straightforward as far
as mounting hardware is concerned so
somehow they found a way to mount this
using either two screws or like two
little Clippy things uh here it is so
this is the back plate I guess how does
this work well you're smart people I'm
sure you can figure it out when you buy
it and see the instruction manual okay
so the actual cooler itself it has a
plastic shroud ething on the top and to
remove the fan you just squeeze that
together and pull the fan out why don't
we just remove the fan okay so there's
the fan it's a 120 millimeter round fan
and what's a little bit special about
this fan that I'm gonna point out right
off the bat here is the fact that it is
round and the fact that at the bottom
the frame is actually cut out so you see
how the frame is thick here but then
thin down at the bottom so that's what
they're talking about when they say
you've got PWM cooling because this fan
will actually it'll blow directed air
through the heatsink fins from the sides
here but then it has no it has no no air
Direction flow control here so what it
does is when it spins it'll just kind of
randomly blow air out the bottom which
will keep your voltage regulators as
well as your memory modules anything
around your CPU socket a lot cooler so
that's pretty neat alright so why don't
we have a look at
I'm aware itself so like they said they
use a twin tower design so that means
that you're taking advantage not only of
the air coming out of the fan but also
the air coming into the fan and while
it's not quite as effective as say
taking these two putting them
side-by-side and throwing two separate
fans on it the air once it's been
through one set of fins is not that hot
compared to the actual CPU so it's still
going to do a fair amount of cooling on
the other side now on the sides of this
heatsink we've got a couple more like
plastic shroud II things and those don't
appear to come off okay then if you look
down into the bottom you can see the
mounting system a little bit better I
still I'm not a hundred percent clear
about how that works but we're seeing
the autofocus abilities of this LifeCam
pretty well here and it's doing a
terrific job actually all right fin fin
density so here you why don't we oh
let's look through the fins at the
screen I don't know what that proved but
now we've done it okay for heat pipes at
the bottom these appear to be six
millimeter heat pipes they're not
particularly thick but my experience
that comes down to design more than you
know marketing bullet points so this is
an excellent cooler and it does a great
job you've got the pre-applied mx2 here
on the bottom and I think that pretty
much takes care of everything I wanted
to say about the the Arctic cooling
extrude freezer extreme Reve - thank you
for checking out my unboxing and oh yeah
we should talk about that
that camera a little bit - let's have a
look at the software so this is the
Microsoft LifeCam software you can
adjust tree color settings which are
over here so you can turn that on and
off oh that's so that's what happens if
I turn off true color it becomes a lot
harder for it to control the Huelva
color and it does a great job actually
based on the video we just took you can
expect a bunch of different modes for
capturing video we're using 1280 by 720
HD video capture you can adjust your
Microsoft microphone volume which I hope
is high enough after we've done this big
long video and yeah that's it thank you
for checking out my unboxing
lots more video updates to come oh yeah
