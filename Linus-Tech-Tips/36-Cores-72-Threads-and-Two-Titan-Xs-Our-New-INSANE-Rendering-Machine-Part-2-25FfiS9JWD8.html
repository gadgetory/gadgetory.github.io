you tighten an LG a retention bracket
you'll have to look closely to see it
though there's actually a lot of
pressure on the CPU and it moves
significantly as you lower the retention
arms so I figured you know we're
probably just not applying enough
pressure if we'd found a way to tighten
the heatsink down enough I think we
could have pulled it off and but we
didn't do that so now we need a new way
to mount our coolers
Kingston kc3 ten series SSDs feature
firmware based power loss protection
massive capacities up to 960 gigs and
not to mention they perform well enough
that we're using them in our 24 SSD
server with that massive raid array so
click right here to learn more Hey there
we go
alright we're back in business business
of breakage it's really great that Intel
provisions
you know these emergency mounting
mechanisms into their socket designs
they think of everything I think we're
on here that hey there you go she's
posting with two CPUs installed let's
get that other cooler on
okay so we're booted into Windows it
looks like all the hardware is working
we haven't put in the second Titan X yet
but there's time there's time for that I
think we have to close out this video
though so we'll finish up with just a
validation that everything's in here so
we can see the maximum speed of our CPUs
how many sockets how many cores and
threads we have stay tuned guys we're
going to benchmark this thing want to
check out power consumption want to see
if we can crush some leaderboards so
stay tuned for that in the meantime like
this video now for you guys it won't
really seem like we've made a ton of
progress since last week it has been a
full week since I've even been able to
touch this but actually I've aside from
cleaning up the desk area here I have
been hard at work on trying to get this
thing working now you can see it's
working now but the issue is that this
motherboard is really designed for
server use not workstation use and in
spite of mine and super micros and best
efforts to dink around with a bazillion
different BIOS settings and all of that
stuff we got one card going but we
couldn't get to and I really wanted to
tighten X's in here not for SLI or
gaming or anything but for more
cute performance more of debt cuda so I
have been waiting for two things to
arrive number one is a Seuss's whatever
this thing is
Zed 10 PE - D 16 this is an a soos dual
socket board as well as the dual 10
gigabit NIC that I'm going to need since
that board doesn't have - 10 Gigabit LAN
ports on board the other thing I thought
I needed is these not too narrow
mounting brackets but I don't think that
board actually uses the narrow ilm so I
may not actually need these anymore my
zip ties were a great solution anyway I
am so excited actually Supermicro has
sent an additional board as well they
sent one of their workstation ones so
we're still not locked into using this
one especially because their workstation
one does have the LAN ports we need
which means I can reuse that card
somewhere else but you know JJ was all
up in my business on Twitter being like
yo Linus you should really be using a
soos for everything so I figured I might
as well at least give them a chance so
here it is my friends the unboxing
experience so many CDs and that my
friends is the board itself so as I
suspected it does not use the narrow ilm
so that was all for nothing potentially
and there we go still got 16 memory
slots still got to LGA 2011 three
sockets still uses 24 pin eight pin
eight pin and whoa what's that we've got
an additional four pin power down here
so that is three CPU power connectors
pretty fantastic we've got 6 SATA ports
another four down here we've got
whatever the devil all this stuff is USB
3 on a front panel header we've got an
MDOT 2 socket which is pretty
interesting so let's go ahead and get
this baby I get this baby rigged up
maybe with proper mounting hardware this
time yeah I know right well people keep
complaining that I'm not doing it
properly so this time I'm going to do it
properly they're going to end up with a
boring video
and no one's going to be happy that may
be a Seuss to not see their hardware
being the street okay now here's
something you know many of you haters
probably aren't noticing but go back and
look for it me grounding myself out
while I'm working I actually do do it I
kill surprisingly little hardware I
almost kill a lot of hardware
eight okay it just counts down it hurts
here it just counts down the entire
range of postcodes that it can display
this is not fairly why okay hey um well
gee man I have had I have had better I
went through hell with that Super Micro
board and I was just hoping Asus quality
man I'm gonna plug everything in and
it's gonna be like rockin out and I am
I'm in a super sad state right now do
you need sort of the full update uh yeah
I'm not aware of any of this I mean I
guess it's something you're working on
with with Roger yeah if you can at least
let me know what but for now I can see
what's inside I can give you and then
hopefully we can kind of help help get
things moving forward okay
in consumer-based voice because there's
a higher likelihood the consumers are
utilizing higher end cards and newer
cards that have GOP initialization
policies support we have an auto routine
built in that should an exercise that
detect it allowed to become a payment
okay so we actually got it to post and
we didn't get that error with the
network card in the bottom PCI Express
16x lot but we ran into a new thing
where we couldn't see any of our boot
devices so we pulled that out and we're
trying again now so one way or another
I'm not getting this video out on Sunday
am I uh it still might be a possibility
might be a possibility defense I can I
might be able to actually get a hold of
them today just a pencil and if I can
get ahold of rpm teacher to get them to
get Mira Corsa
so unfortunately a Seuss's bios team was
not available to work on a custom bios
for me on the weekend so we're gonna
have to settle for one Titan X but I
don't want to leave you guys hanging any
longer so we are going to run some
rudimentary benchmarks with our two 2699
VIII's so our thirty-six cores are 128
gigs of ram and a single Titan X
graphics card so we're going to kick the
and one of the things that I want to
look at well a number of things I want
to look at is power consumption temps
now that we have proper coolers on them
I want to see what kind of turbo an we
get out of something like a gaming
workload and of course I want to see
that Cinebench number check this out
idle power consumption is under a
hundred watts from the wall closer to 90
watts this is with an 80 plus Platinum
efficiency power supply but still that
means it's actually only consuming
somewhere in the neighborhood of 85
watts at idle of course the story is
going to change somewhat under load so
let's go ahead and see how much we can
actually draw here so what idle the CPU
was sitting at about 1.2 gigahertz now
it's turbo up to 2.6 when we're hitting
it with a full load so you can see we've
started a stability test here in I 264
and our CPU usage is sitting in the
neighborhood of 98 to probably a hundred
by the time it refreshes again percent
and check that out that is with just the
CPUs working that's the kind of power
consumption we'd expect to see from a
gaming rig including graphics cards but
these are not CPUs for the faint of
heart I think I saw that touch 500 Watts
just hitting the CPUs so let's go ahead
and let's add system memory does it let
me change the stress test mid-flight
whoo it really doesn't like that Denton
uh let's see
okay so memory usage is closing in at a
hundred percent now and you can see that
thanks to the efficiency of the ddr4
modules from Kingston that we're using
we're still hovering around that 500
watt mark but now we're consistently or
much more frequently around that 500
watt mark now we're going to throw GPU
into the mix and see what happens so now
that the GPU running we're actually
seeing sustained loads in the high 600's
and I've even seen peaks at around 700
watts but what's cool is we're still
running at our max turbo frequency CPU
temps are still very much under control
in the low 60s to high 50s range
in spite of the fact that the air is
noticeably warmer in a sphere around
this open testbench
computer so this is good news it means
everything's stable and we can proceed
with the rest of our benchmarks next up
is everyone's favorite multi-core CPU
benchmarks in a bench ar-15 let's go
ahead and run that bad boy so that is
what it looks like to see 72 threads
ripping through Cinebench I have never
seen anything quite like it Wow
so that's a score of 39 81 in Cinebench
r15 so for perspective that's what a 12
core Xeon at 2.6 6 gigahertz is capable
of and we completely left that in the
dust by more than 3x reading mark I
wasn't expecting to get like powerhouse
amazing results thanks to the low clock
speed of the CPU and the fact that we're
only running one GPU so it's not exactly
optimized for it but I was expecting a
little bit better on the physics core
that's actually significantly lower than
you can do on a 4770k showing that while
it is a multi-threaded test it can't
handle 72 threads not so much so for our
last trick we're gonna try and top the
reel bench so that's a soos is our og
benchmark scoreboard without an ROG
motherboard I mean it's still an ASUS
motherboard I'm sure they won't be too
upset about it but oh I want to be able
to have a look at how our multi-threaded
CPU is helping us during this benchmark
so let's get that baby open it looks
like we're using like one of our threads
maybe two two two two threads I have no
idea if that image editing score is any
good but the encoding benchmark is
running and we're finally getting some
CPU utilization only 50% Mac's so far oh
oh oh here we go here we go okay so our
final test is heavy multitasking and
once again I am NOT getting necessarily
the results I was hoping for we have not
yet we have not yet broken our second
see oh yeah there it is yes
so our score was not that great system
score 91,000 dish which puts us actually
pretty far down the leaderboard
something about the dual socket Ness is
not appreciated by a lot of the
benchmarks that we've been playing
around with here but this is something
that we kind of expected and I think
ties pretty well into the conclusion for
this video so I'm actually going to go
I'm going to extend next to it here this
kind of a system is not for desktop use
we know this and it's I had a lot of
people criticizing me on social media
about the fact that we're even running
Windows on it because this is the kind
of thing that if you're doing some kind
of serious number crunching that for
whatever reason doesn't benefit from GPU
you really need CPU for it for some
reason that's what this is for and it's
becoming more and more of a niche use
case scenario in a lot of cases
something like Linux might be better for
those particular workloads but what
people don't know is what we're actually
doing with this system and what we'll be
doing with it is not going to be general
usage where we've demonstrated that you
probably shouldn't have 36 cores and 72
threads
what we'll be doing with it is we'll be
running a specialized piece of software
right now the front-runner is Sorenson
squeeze server to significantly reduce
the output times of our videos so that
we can turn them around much more
quickly as well as actually transcode
footage upon ingesting off of our
cameras so that it's easier for our pcs
to work with while we're editing the
videos creating something called a proxy
so that is what the system is for and
for that it will be excellent so you
guys are going to want to stay tuned
where we'll show well it hooked up to
the 10 gigabit network we're going to
show its performance rendering videos
over the network once we've actually got
the software we're using finalized and
that is going to be a sight to behold
even if running desktop grade benchmarks
with GPUs that are running it well not
bad high clock speeds wasn't that
impressive today so thanks for watching
guys like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment preferably at the link
to our forum in the video description if
you want to discuss it also linked in
the video description you can buy a cool
t-shirt like this one although this
particular one is over on T spring so
you're going to want to go ahead and
check out the special link in order to
get one of our first campaign Linus tech
tip shirts also linked in the video
description you can change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
I think that pretty much wraps it up
thanks again for watching and as always
don't forget to subscribe wait that's a
like I don't know what I'm doing anymore
it's Saturday shouldn't even be working
I'm not even supposed to be at work
today
three Internet points if you know the
reference I'm not even supposed to be
here I didn't even get it right whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
