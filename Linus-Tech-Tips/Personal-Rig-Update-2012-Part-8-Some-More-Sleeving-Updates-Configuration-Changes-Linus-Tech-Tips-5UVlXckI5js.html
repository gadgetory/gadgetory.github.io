time again although unfortunately I
don't have nearly as much of an update
for you guys as I would have liked so
I'm starting to test fit things together
honest I haven't worked on the project
in quite a while the the tops of my
copperhead spreaders are still at the
plating shop where I discovered that
they actually can't be plated because
they aren't brass which is what I
thought they were made of they are made
of coloured aluminum which is going to
be a bit of an issue so yeah that's no
good as you can see I've made some rough
marks on the back in terms of where I
want to cut out a CPU cut out as well as
some cable management holes yeah I put
this back in you can see it's no longer
black it is now completely stripped I
actually had some issues with some of
the metal that I that I got back from
the plating shop because they were
covered in white residue when I got them
back and so I cleaned them and
unfortunately I didn't dry them as well
as I'd thought and I got some rusting
going on inside to clean them again with
wd-40 which means I'm going to have to
rinse them in a solvent before I can
actually get them painted um yeah some
of that going on there um right test
fitting components so this this whole
phase is going to be basically getting
the whole system built and wired so all
the custom wires made and sleeved it all
it loops and all of that without before
I get it painted so the whole thing has
to be pretty much done and then it's
time to send everything off for painting
once I've made all the cuts that I need
to make as you can see I switched
motherboards I'm actually going to be
going with the x79 ud5 unless a better
option presents itself because in terms
of coil line and aesthetic appeal it's
the best balance I can find the Asus one
doesn't quell wine but I be color scheme
doesn't really match what I'm trying to
do and this one the MSI one that I have
as a bit of a coil line issue when sort
of doing anything the irony is that this
doesn't whine when I'm doing anything
CPU intensive but it wins when I'm
transferring anything over the network
so yeah every board has its quirks um I
can't stand play line personally and its
really dampened my enthusiasm for the
whole project to be perfectly honest
because I hate spending a bunch of time
building something that I know I'm not
going to be happy with and I'm going to
have to change something later other
progress though moving right along
speaking of things that don't coil whine
and are awesome in every way the XFX CD
plus platinum power supply so I've
actually done the remark focus you can
do it focus on that
and then focus on that there you go so
I've done the bulk of the sleeving
that'll they'll go into this power
supply because I'm not going to bother
sleeping things that you're not going to
be able to see I'll just leave the stock
sleeping on those ones so you can see
the CPU connector in there is done the
24 pin connector here is done so that's
pretty much what it'll look like with my
patented two wires per sleeve individual
sleeving so semi individual sleeping is
what we'll call that yeah I think it
looks pretty sharp so you can see the
color is a little bit right at the very
ends I'm willing to live with that
compromise so yeah I think that's pretty
much it so you guys will find out in a
moment why I haven't had any time to
work on my personal rig and I apologize
for the color in this shot because it's
terrible we had a bit of a camera
malfunction but we caught him at his
best so I'm probably just gonna going to
go with that so guys this is the reason
why I haven't really had time to work on
my personal rig other than the couple
small updates that you can see that you
saw so far make sure he's sitting here
ok so this is my baby boy and I'm not
sure how many appearances he'll make on
the channel but at any rate I figured
I'd give you guys sort of the scoop of
what's going on and he's doing pretty
well on the camera here can you give us
a smile
what do you think I don't think we're
gonna get a smile out of him that's okay
we had another clip that had bad white
balance where he randomly randomly
managed to smile a little bit so let's
just get him scooped up here okay so
let's see your practice say thanks for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips oh wow look good
timing um yeah I know sweetheart so guys
this is basically the reason why I
haven't had any time at all to work on
my personal rig and hey you got some for
some reason the camera loves him and he
loves it because he was so grumpy for
the hour leading up to us filming this
and now he's giving us a nice big long
smile so uh this is my baby boy and I'm
not sure if I'll make too many parents's
in the videos but ah there you go
so more personal rig updates when I get
to it but for now there are other
priorities aren't there sweetheart</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
