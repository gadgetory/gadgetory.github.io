coverage of Computex 2018 try it for
free today at the link in the video
description so last CES razor showed off
a concept notebook shell that allowed
you to take their gaming phone and put
it in as like a touchpad and then like a
larger Android experience and I was kind
of going hey this has kind of been done
before so this is a little lackluster
compared to your previous concept
products and be why the hell would
anybody want a full-size Android
experience it's terrible
so MSI apparently saw an opportunity
here and they are showing off a much
better solution because why would you
want to run a desktop experience or
laptop experience on underpowered mobile
hardware when you can run a mobile
software experience on totally old P
gaming laptop hardware so I don't
normally cover like some software crap
that comes bundled with a gaming
notebook but the N MSI app player is
actually pretty freaking cool so it's
not a new concept running an Android
emulator on a computer in fact they even
got a sticker right here it is based on
the BlueStacks Android emulator but what
effectively they've done here is
packaged this into something that is
very usable and very practical for
gamers so what you're looking at right
here is the full fat Google Play Store
where we can get any normal Android apps
any normal Android games and yes my
friends you should see where we're going
with that
so using this software you can use a
mouse and WASD or a game controller to
control Android games giving you a
distinct advantage compared to people
who are playing on mobile with their
like touchscreen joysticks and all that
stuff so the better the system the
better the experience it'll take
advantage of your CPU
your GPU and even things like high
refresh rate displays and there are
other intrinsic advantages as well you
don't have to worry about battery life
constraints you get to use your
full-size notebook great audio solution
and if you plug into a wired network
connection you don't have to worry about
any mobile network leg bullcrap or
anything like that now they're mostly
focused on gaming but you can run any
app from the Play Store there's a bunch
of great functionality built in here as
well
so you can see there's hotkeys for
pretty much anything and MSI's
SteelSeries keyboards built into their
laptops allow you to remap any of that
let's just go ahead and make this
fullscreen and you guys might have
noticed that I'm running this on an MSI
desktop now so they are not limiting it
to just their notebooks in fact it's not
even limited to just their gaming
products so their motherboards their
video cards even their new prestige
series non gaming notebooks are going to
have support for this app and this is a
huge boon for streamers for example some
people do stream android games so now
all you got to do is hook up a secondary
monitor run your regular OBS and xsplit
and then you just run this in a window
and you can do all of your gaming and
streaming from one machine this is a
seriously unfair advantage that's not my
problem
one last point is that if you suck at
games like me so this is some like weird
pub G clone or something you can
actually run multiple games at the same
time so if you're like waiting around
for a respawn you can just flip over
into another tab here playing on play
Angry Birds or whatever while you're
waiting and then just flip back over and
you're ready to continue one last point
clip from MSI said if I don't talk about
his prestige series he's not going to
send me a gigantic life-size MSI dragon
so this is their new thin and light
prestige series it's got like a metal
chassis 8th gen core i7 so up to
quad-core HDMI a couple type C's a
couple Taipei's you got your SD card
1080p IP it looks like IPS yep not too
bad and so the point here is basically
that MSI is finally
doing something other than gaming
notebooks so good for them and good for
us for telling you guys about
LastPass our sponsor here at Computex
