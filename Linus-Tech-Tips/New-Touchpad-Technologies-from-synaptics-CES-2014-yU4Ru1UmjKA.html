brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here at
synaptics a company that i didn't really
expect to cover when I came to see yes
but I do have two really cool things
that they're showing off and they're
both touch pads for laptops the first
one has 44 sensors inside of the touch
pad that can tell how hard you're
pressing down so the main demo I like on
this is if you do the two-finger swipe
to scroll down a page and you keep going
you don't have to just continually swipe
over and over and over again if you push
down harder while it's already going
it'll scroll down really fast and if you
don't push down very hard it'll scroll
down slowly and you can actively change
that while you're looking which is
actually really really cool the other
one which is totally different has zones
on each side of the touchpad which work
as if you're touching the screen so for
Windows 8 if you swipe on the right one
it'll bring in the contextual menu with
the different options on the right side
and if you swipe on the left one it'll
switch what application is actively open
this is awesome because I hate touching
the screen when I'm using a laptop it's
weird I hate fingerprints on the screen
and hand movement from touchpad to
keyboard is natural in my opinion and
had moving movement from touchpad to
keyboard toe screen is not that natural
I'm not a huge fan of it so this is
actually really cool and I really like
the implementation thanks to our
sponsors for sending us to CES thank you
guys for watching and as always be sure
