your PC to illuminate your sick build or
give it a cool color effect that matches
the rest of it
however today I'll be talking about LED
lighting for video production and why we
decided to adapt it to light the
majority of the videos we make here at
Linus Media Group Intel has brought ddr4
to the mainstream with their core i7
6700 K and Core i5 6600 K processors
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so to
understand how we came to where we are
today we have to go back to the lights I
started with starting with one of the
classics this is the standard lowell
tungsten fixture it's a floodlight which
utilizes an incandescent bulb that draws
a rather high 1000 watts from the wall
it packs quite a bit of punch but your
power bill will start to rack up using
several of these for too long not to
mention how hot the light itself gets
after only a couple of minutes of use
making it much more difficult to operate
tungsten lights have long been the
staple of lighting for anyone doing
video work for decades but because of
their high-powered raw and heat output
they can be a less attractive option to
work with we need lots of lights set up
at once and are tight on power
distribution this brings me to the next
solution that we had fluorescent lights
and in this context specifically compact
fluorescent lights or CFLs like this
impact softbox which can take a total of
four CFL bulbs the benefit to a light
like this is that they are generally a
much lower power draw to the previous
tungsten the main problem with them for
our use is that the bulbs that can
typically use in a fixture like this are
not of the highest quality when it comes
to color CFLs specifically also do not
lend themselves well to dimming so the
control you have over the output on
these types of lights is a bit lacking
overall while we did end up using the
CFL softboxes for a long time here on
Lana's tech tips I've been continually
looking for a better solution since the
column from the CFLs even when properly
white balance left something to be
desired this brings me to our main
fixtures of choice and what I use to
shoot over 80% of what we do here at
Linus Media Group high output LED lights
and in this case Westcott Flex LED kits
for a long time LEDs had a
very bad reputation when it came to
using them for video or photography work
this attitude towards the mainly stems
from the vast majority of LEDs available
in the first few years being garbage in
terms of build quality features and
particularly color this was the main
reason I had held back from using them
since I had not found any LEDs that were
better than our overall setup LEDs in
the beginning tend to have nasty green
or magenta color spikes not unlike
poorly made CFLs
now however LEDs have been refined to be
of a much higher quality the Wescott
flecks have become one of my favorite
lights to use around the office simply
because of how fast they are to adapt to
any situation as well as their excellent
rendering of skin tones compared to LEDs
I've used in the past with LED lights
like the Flex I can travel to any
location that has any wall power and not
worry about blowing a circuit with any
of the lights that I want to use thanks
to LEDs far more efficient power draw
the opposite is true if I ever wanted to
utilize lights like our low incandescent
since blowing the circuit even in the
studio is a constant concern if I'm not
careful a power distribution the Flex
system like other LEDs can also utilize
a portable battery system allowing us
use the lights in places where we cannot
draw from the wall like in a car or on
location outdoors an example of how I'm
currently using one of our flex lights
is in our workshop set I'm utilizing one
of our midsize flex lights as a fill
light for both sides of the set in this
inexpensive 30 inch china ball and
because of the flexibility of the design
I've simply fold a little light into a
cylinder and clipped it to the inside of
the channel super simple on the recent
video that Luke did on the steamvr
performance test which you can watch
here I use flexes to set up each
location we've shot the video in I had a
fairly limited amount of time and I hate
doing math so instead of calculating if
I could blow a circuit running all of
our tungsten lights and instead of using
the fluorescence which can take a while
to turn on using the LEDs made sense and
helped me speed through the setup
process so in conclusion I like many
others had my reservations for utilizing
LED lighting for video production but
since Linus would kill me if I
accidentally kept leaving lights that
drew a thousand watts of power
constantly LED lights like the flex
light have become a good solution to
simplify the way that I work and for the
curious I would highly recommend seeing
if LED lights would fit your workflow
and needs
and on that subject Rackspace Rackspace
is the top tier managed cloud computing
company they've got dedicated storage
options to meet the performance security
network capacity and compliance needs of
pretty much anybody I mean if they don't
have it then it's probably not not there
they're backed by their fanatical 24/7
365 support and they're inviting all of
you to their interactive deep dive
sessions they take an hour out of every
week or two to discuss the benefits of
dedicated solutions and their place in a
cloud enabled world they have upcoming
events and recorded Google Hangouts
available on topics from security to
compliance to performance and cost they
will provide you with downloads to
reference architectures ebooks and white
papers on the sessions landing pages and
it's a live and active participation so
you can go and ask real questions to
real people and interact with them their
next sessions are on moving to the cloud
and leaving your VMware deployment
behind and performance requirements
improving operational efficiency check
out the details in the video description
below so thank you guys for watching if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or even consider
supporting us directly by using our
affiliate code to shop at Amazon buying
a cool t-shirt like this one or with the
direct monthly contribution through the
forum now that you're done doing all
that stuff you're probably wondering
what to watch next so in the top right
hand corner click that little button
where Luke cooks out pizza on a computer
made of cardboard yeah it's pretty
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
