the r9 nano from AMD there is the review
that kicked it off that showed a badass
little card that produced a massive
amount of performance for its size
without this card I wouldn't have been
able to do my fallout 4 bomb build and
it was the ideal GPU for Linus's seven
gamers one CPU built but we have
received criticism here from people
saying that the Nano only really works
in ideal thermal situations and that the
970 Mini from the other team is the real
small form-factor King due to that
problem is there any weight to this
argument let's see
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors show you the link in
the video description to learn more
first let's introduce the competitors
starting with the AMD r9 nano it
features a fiji core GPU with 4096
stream processors and 4 gigabytes of HBM
or high bandwidth memory running at 1
gigabit per freaking second on a memory
bus width of 4096 bits the whole thing
has a GPU boost clock of 1,000 megahertz
and houses all of this within a 5 inch
by 4 and three eighths inch body which
has done super well in raw performance
benchmarks in the past in the other
corner we have the asus 970 mini running
a total of 16 64 cuda cores and 4
gigabytes of gddr5 memory which is
running at seven thousand and ten
megahertz on a 256-bit memory interface
the whole thing has a GPU boost clock of
twelve hundred and twenty eight
megahertz and comfortably sits within a
frame that is seven point seven inches
by four point eight inches which is also
done super well in benchmarks in the
past but more on the thermal and price
to performance side of things looking
back at the review of the nano we can
see the differences clearly laid out in
the benchmarking graphs the nano handily
beats the 970 mini in everything when
looking at raw performance when you
break away from that and look at overall
wattage or thermal output the story
changes and the 970 beats the Nano quite
easily as well and then finally they do
end up tying but in the performance per
watt category the cards also have quite
the price Delta within us funds the nano
coming at 479 dollars while the mini
sits at a much more digestible 299 and
this shows in the dollars per frame
benchmark where the nano was literally
the most expensive per frame card we
tested and the mini was literally the
least expensive per frame card we tested
quite the polarization all of that being
said those benchmarks are a little bit
dated and so far what we know is that if
you want a faster and smaller card you
can grab the
I know and pay up about an extra 180
bucks but if you can deal with the
slightly bigger size don't mind a bit of
performance loss and want to save some
pennies on your power bill
you can not spend the extra and go for
the mini options are good and these two
cards serve the small form-factor market
quite well in their own ways and nicely
complement each other in a way that I
personally think Foster's healthy
competition instead of blind fanboying
which is pretty cool but today we look
at them again for one more testing
scenario I had issues with the nanos
performance in my fallout bomb and it
took a lot for me to mostly fix it most
cases have adequate air flow for your
GPU but not all of them the ones that
have very restricted GPU air flow that
we have apparently left at Liza's house
for undisclosed reasons so what we did
to replace the cases that are apparently
alliances house is we grabbed the node
202 a solid small form-factor case from
fractal if you want to see the review of
that check up here and then in order to
restrict the airflow more because this
can actually take a full sized graphics
card we grabbed a fractal Maju vent from
a define r5 that we had lying around and
then just taped it to the side we then
tested Crysis 3 Tomb Raider and
Battlefront both with the cover on and
with the cover off with both cards upon
initial investigation of the raw average
numbers the nano does throttle when the
obstruction is introduced but not by
enough and it still kind of wins by
significant amount in every single
scenario but that definitely is not the
whole story
the average FPS doesn't lie but it's
also not an accurate description of how
it felt the mini didn't give a crap it
got a little warmer but performed
exactly the same in all three games with
or without the obstruction the nano
throttled and throttled pretty hard
making the games feel sluggish and weird
due to inconsistent clock speeds as the
card was fluctuating clock speeds
throughout the test as it throttled and
then no longer throttled and etc okay so
that's
not great for the Nano but I don't
necessarily think that this is actually
a big deal before you scream at me allow
me to explain we had to create this
scenario this is a bad airflow scenario
that being said there are cases that
will have highly restricted air flow for
your GPU but this just arms you with
more information for the planning phase
of your build if you have an extremely
airflow restricted scenario either find
a way to feed the Nano some more air or
just take a step down to the mini which
can still handle it and be a pretty
badass card regardless tunnel Bayer is
the easy-to-use VPN app for mobile and
desktop tunnel Bayer lets you tunnel
into 16 different countries allowing you
to browse the Internet and use online
services as if you are in said different
country they have apps for iOS Android
PC and Mac and they also have a Chrome
extension their apps are easy to use
just pick the country that you want to
go to essentially turn tunnel there on
and watch as your bear tunnels your
internet connection to your new location
when you turn tunnel there on 2 things
happen your connection becomes encrypted
with AES 256-bit encryption and your
public IP address gets switched so you
can show up as if you are in said
different country as you probably
understand at this point with tunnel
bear you get 500 megabytes of data for
free so you can just try it out no
credit card required if you want to
upgrade to unlimited data you can save
10% off by going to tunnel bear comm /l
tt did this information influence your
opinion on these cards let me know on
Twitter at Luke on ask or tell AFR if
you like this video thumbs up if you
just like this video thumbs down if you
thought this video was kind of like
average but you you're like these guys
seem alright I guess I could watch more
of their videos click the subscribe
button don't forget to buy a cool
t-shirt that isn't this one because this
is from Bastian I wore it because like
I'm going to PAX East soon
I thought it kind of made sense don't
worry but it you can click the link the

if you want to use our Amazon affiliate

would be awesome or you can go to the
forum become a contributor there check
out this video which is the original
review of the Nano because I don't know
it's a pretty sweet card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
