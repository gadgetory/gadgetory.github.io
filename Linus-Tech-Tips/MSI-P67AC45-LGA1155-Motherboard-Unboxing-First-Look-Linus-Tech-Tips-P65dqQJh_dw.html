military class to motherboard from MSI
even though it is military class this is
not part of their gaming series of
products it's a sea board which means
it's part of their I believe it stands
for classic series of products so since
this is a socket 1155 board it means we
have full support but not full support
hold on I'll get more and more on that
later we have support for Intel's Core
i3 Core i5 and core i7 processors on the
LGA 1155 platform supports Windows 7 it
has a p67 chipset so what that means is
that it does not support the onboard
graphics on said CPUs so it does support
the unlocking overclocking k-series
chips but no long board graphics support
it features OC Genie 2 which will
overclock your k-series CPU at the push
of a button and it features USB 3 and
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second we have
super ferrite chokes as well as solid
caps as part of the military class 2
concept and let's flip over to the back
and see what else in maasai has to say
for themselves pretty much the same
stuff we got a couple things that
weren't covered on the front such as
click BIOS so that is a UEFI graphical
bios and we have Winky 3 which is their
software that allows you to use your
computer before booting into the OS and
that's pretty much it so why don't we
flip this over and have a look at the
board itself in terms of accessories
we've got a pretty basic package here
drivers and utilities don't use this
download the latest off the MSI website
you have a quick installation guide a
user's guide for the software
applications as well as a user's guide
for this board as well as a couple of
other boards note one other board three
other boards we have an i/o shield which
are okay on the value board like this
it's rare to see it color coding but
here you have it it is color coded and
then we've also got to say 2 3 6 gigabit
per second cable so well I don't know
there could be anything yeah they're
called 6 gigabits per second cables but
there's no actual physical difference
between these and three gigabit per
second cables one is right angled and
one is straight we have M connectors
which allow you to connect your front
panel power speaker all that stuff
more easily and then we've also got one
for us be environmentally friendly
cardboard packaging allows us to not see
the board yet
although we will soon come on there we
go
pretty difficult to remove there all
right so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna close
the bulb or glass when you put the board
on top and then we're gonna have a look
the p67 8:45 sticker comes off and the
motherboard comes out so we've got a
pretty standard board layout here ATX
form factor board it has the full
complement of seven slots I'm just gonna
take off the OC Genie sticker as well as
the military plastic sticker so we can
see exactly what we've got to work with
here guys a little challenging to leave
there we are okay so let's look at the
overall layout once again value board 8
pin connector so MSI is allowing for
some serious overclocking going on if
they're expecting us to need an 8 pin
connector to deliver all of the
potential current we could need to the
CPU itself and go ahead and throw that
back on there remember these little
Stoppers are here because you can use a
four pin connector just by leaving the
stopper on there so it shows you which
set to plug your 4 pin ATX connector
into if you don't have the full 8 pin
ATX connector we've got a couple of
military class 2 themed MOSFET heat
sinks on here so one on that side one on
the top surrounding the CPU socket which
is pretty pretty bare space around it so
you should be able to mount pretty much
any heat sinks you want on there as I
mentioned before this is an LGA 1155
socket which means support for core i3
squads and core i7s do not try to put an
1156 CPU in here it will not work
we have full support for dual channel
ddr3 memory and then moving down the
right-hand side of the board we've got
our 24 pin ATX connector and we have
some storage so here we have two say 2 3
6 gigabit per second connectors running
off of the Intel chipset and then we
have 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
connectors also running off of the Intel
chipset lots of fan headers on this
oh no movie not that many okay for fan
headers reasonable number of fan headers
on this board moving down the board
we've got our front panel connectors as
well as front USB 3.0 a front USB 2.0
header front firewire as well as front
audio in terms of slot layout we've got
three PCI slots this is a more value
oriented board so it doesn't surprise me
to see PCI slots included and you may
need them if you have a board like this
we've also got three PCIe 1x slot so one
of them would be covered if you were to
use a dual slot graphics card which
would leave you with two PCIe 1x and
three PCIe slots finally moving on to
the i/o shield we've got one of those
combo ps2 keyboard / Mouse ports that
I'm a big fan of we have eight USB 2.0
ports a clear CMOS button look at that
clear CMOS button on a value board looks
like MSI does have some overclocking in
mind with this guy alright we've got our
coaxial as well as optical audio out
firewire Gigabit Ethernet two USB 3.0
ports as well as 7.1 audio and look at
that they're even using screws on the
back to fix all of the heat sinks
happy to see that I hate to see pushpins
on any board that's that's that's like
pretty decent because screws are just
more secure there's no ifs ands or buts
about it so thank you for checking out
