about sponsoring a piece of content that
demonstrated the benefits of their
security and home automation ecosystem
but as I was sitting on the couch
tinkering with their hub that connects
to your TV I realized something my son
who just turned 4 wasn't impressed at
all by the idea that the doorbell
ringing could trigger a notification on
my phone and a picture in picture view
of whoever standing outside
he took it completely for granted so I
was inspired to create this list of
seven differences between when I was his
age and today
first things first when I was the same
age as my eldest son all of my toys
required me to do all the voices and the
actions myself this friggin thing would
have completely blown my mind it even
knows his name I'm pretending to be a
whore
and that's not the only thing that does
all the work for you I mean berenstain
bears visit the dentist is great and all
but this this is progress number two
video games were nostalgia filter aside
objectively worse and I was one of the
lucky ones I had a game gear I mean that
thing had a color screen back in 1990
just too bad it only stayed on for about
three hours every time you put six
double a batteries in it a practice that
would probably make the mobile games
with autosave generation say very cringe
much old man technology if they even say
that anymore
number three movie content may have been
similar or better I'll put homeward
bound up against Django Unchained or
whatever any day but finding physical
media realizing it's not ruined
my kids won't even know that those
renovations to put it in context I
graduated high school when YouTube was
invented and my kids will take for
granted that watching any video they
want is as simple as clicking an icon
not to mention the constant
interruptions if the doorbell rang
during my Saturday morning cartoons I
had to get off my butt and go see who it
was which okay so nothing quite like
that ever happened you can tell because
I'm standing here today but this is one
of the coolest things about the saige
home automation system you've got a
picture and picture view of the scary
guy
so you've at least got a few second head
start to go hide under your blanket
number four well I'm pretty sure that
every generation thinks homework is a
total drag trust me kids
it was worse when I was a kid I mean
that was even before
Encarta encyclopedia on cd-rom when we
had to actually sign out actual books
from an actual library well so much for
horrifyingly out of date because yay
school funding and don't even get me
started on pens I mean between the
backspace button and Wikipedia which may
not be perfect but it's a great starting
point the new generations only excuse
for being uninformed is pure laziness
which leads us pretty well into number
five when I was already snuggled up in
bed in the winter I wanted to turn off
the lights I had to get off my butt and
turn off a light switch or if I was one
of the cool kids I might have had a
clapper just don't install those things
too close to each other
by contrast there is an entire
generation of people for whom not being
able to control lights with a phone or a
SmartWatch is going to be completely
unthinkable number six communication was
a completely different animal thank you
cards we're written by hand I'm pretty
sure my son has grandma on Facebook and
for voice communication you actually had
to remember your friends number or look
it up in the phone book
everyone just doesn't understand me you
know and even then privacy was never a
guarantee you know just to say hey so
I'm listening
this this is awesome seven is one thing
that may have actually seemed better at
the time coming home after school there
was pretty much no way for my parents to
know if I was actually practicing with
piano or not but from a parent's
perspective being able to check in on
the home and see if workbooks are
actually being completed is a pretty big
boon number eight music playback has
definitely improved CDs brought improved
audio quality and easy track skipping
but even that improvement over cassette
tapes sucks compared to subscription
music services that cost the same as a
handful of albums per year would've
especially when you factor in that most
of the songs weren't even things that
you'd like with that said though you
could make the argument that the quality
of the music itself hasn't changed much
so thanks for watching guys if this
video made you cringe you know what to
do but if it was awesome or you know got
