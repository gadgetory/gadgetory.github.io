cube case is great for air cooling or
liquid cooling check the link in the
video description to learn more I would
make the argument that the rampage for
Jean is still the most extreme grade
motherboard for an M ATX system that is
micro ATX it uses LGA 2011 which at the
time of filming this only supports up to
second gen Intel Core Series processors
so that's Sandy Bridge however Ivy
bridge-e is coming soon meaning you'll
be able to slap a six core Extreme
Edition or non Extreme Edition Ivy
Bridge that's third generation Core
Series processor onto this as well as up
to 32 gigabytes of memory up to two dual
slot graphics cards in sli or crossfire
as well as pretty much anything else you
would want to put on it this is an
extremely powerful little motherboard
and the emphasis of course being on the
fact that it is little it's n ATX I mean
look at that the socket takes up like
most of the motherboard so anyway let's
go through the accessories first of all
there's do-not-disturb I'm gaming go
away Republic of gamers door hanger
awesome love it
there's the ROG connect cable so this
allows you to tweak BIOS options at a
hardware level using a secondary machine
such as a notebook by plugging into the
ROG connect enabled USB port on the back
of the board we've got six SATA cables
so three of them are right angle and
three of them are straight these are
validated 4 SATA 2 or SATA 3 speed
operation
they're cute connector feature which I
feel is for lazy people or people with
very very fat fingers can be handy for
that plugging in your front panel
connectors a Republic of gamers SLI
bridge that is optimized for the short
distance in between the two PCI Express
16x slots and yes those my friends are
full PCI Express 16x slots because this
is LGA 2011 and for anyone who thinks
that LGA 1150 is getting more than four
dimm slots or more than PCIe 8 X by 8 X
SLI or crossfire support anytime soon no
no no no no no no not without things
like sort of weird bridge chips and
clutch
solutions like that next up we've got an
i/o field like patting on the back it's
kind of cool a user guide the rog
connect guide the SATA HDI raid mode
notice as well as an enormous sticker
that I personally wouldn't put anywhere
near my computer but if you really want
to have a huge rog logo on your system
hi JJ yeah I just plug in um anyway
that's up that's up to you that's up to
you why don't we just leave it at that
all right so features other than the
fact that asus reserves the very best
quality components for their republic of
gamers class of products what do you
actually get for spending so much on a
motherboard that inherently doesn't do
that much more than another motherboard
well for one thing especially when
you're trying to build a smaller class
of system using very high quality
components in the voltage regulation
modules is incredibly important so asus
is using 10k black caps that are rated
for a hundred and five degrees celsius
operation so that means that in a
cramped case no matter what color the
bad stuff is going on with this system
you are not going to be in a situation
where it's going to be running out of
spec and it's not going to last for very
long so that is not what this is about
you've also got a nice little heat pipe
that connects all of the various voltage
regulation module components that are
above the socket as well as beside the
socket using higher quality components
also reduces things like coil whine so
for example when you hear that noise
when you're under load that can be
attributed to lower quality components
alright so what else do you get you get
a better audio solution generally
speaking on an asus rog board then you
get almost anywhere else right here is
their redline audio concept so you can
actually see that instead of including
like they did with supreme FX to a
separate PCB riser card that goes into
one of your PCI Express slots they have
a little illuminated red line that
separates the sound card PCB on the
motherboard
from the rest of the PCB there's an
aluminum shield as well as the fact that
the sound processor is as far away from
the other components as possible to
reduce interference
and that right there is a 1,500 micro
farad like massive capacitor in addition
to the audio grade capacitors elsewhere
that compensates for a couple of things
so if you have like a sudden explosion
or something like that and it's drawing
more power than normal you might with a
normal audio solution see something like
clipping or or it's because it's not
able to deliver enough power this is
designed to smooth out those things so
better audio solutions are something
that I personally do feel are help
justify a more expensive board even
though you could buy less expensive
board and a dedicated card but of course
Asus has owned our cards for that you
also get better PCB design so you've got
your PCI Express 8 pin connector still
in its ideal top location as well as the
24 pin connector in its ideal right hand
location this is more difficult and it
does take adding more layers to the PCB
in order to maintain an optimal layout
and still have it fit in a smaller form
factor now I did mention this is a bit
of an older board so the SATA ports feel
a little bit dated at this point but
you've got 4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports to running off the Intel chipset
to running off a third party as media
chipset and then to say 2 to 3 gigabit
per second ports I probably should have
mentioned that the CPU is entirely
digitally powered so all the vrm is
fully digi I think they call it what is
it digi plus 2 so that means you have
all the tweak ability that you could
possibly want that's another thing that
you get with rog boards that you don't
get with other boards is that gonna help
you overclock better unless your name is
andrey yang possibly no but if you want
to feel better having all the bells and
whistles there's the way to do it
actually there's another state of three
SATA to three gigabit per second
connector down here and that's the
opposite of 3g and then we've got our
front panel connectors to front USB 2 as
well as onboard start reset and the Go
button switches you can actually add
this ok your front audio connector and
then that leads us to the PCI Express
slot so dual PCIe 16x this guy right
here is wired only for 8x and this one
is right wired for 4x so you could fill
this up with a full complement of
graphics cards and other expansion cards
and you would get very very satisfactory
perform
indeed it supports up to ddr3 twenty
four hundred megahertz however you will
have to overclock in order to achieve
that and moving along to the rear i/o
we've got eight USB 2.0 ports again this
is a bit of an older board two USB 3.0
ports a clear CMOS button the rog
connect button as well as bios flashback
functionality is built into this board
so if you do brick the board the power
goes out in the middle of a BIOS flash
you can restore it simply by following
the instructions on the issues website
optical digital audio out a ps2 port in
Intel Nick so you can use that to
prioritize game packets using the AI
suite software and then 7.1 audio out as
well as an e SATA port you it includes a
copy of daemon tools standards as well
as Kaspersky antivirus and something
that I'm sure JJ is watching this video
and I'm sure was ready to write me an
email telling me I had forgotten about I
have not supreme fx3 in spite of the
fact that I've mentioned several times
now this is an older board is still
getting updated so there new sound radar
or whatever they call it basically it's
a visual indicator on your screen that
actually points out where sounds are
coming from in-game in real time it's
basically cheating as far as I can tell
but hey every advantage right has been
added to supreme effects three boards
even older ones like this one so you
pair this up with an Ivy bridge-e
processor and a couple of GTX Titans and
you have one powerhouse of a system in a
very small form-factor thank you for
checking out my unboxing an overview of
the Maximus 4 Jean did I say Maximus
because I meant rampage 4 Jean sorry JJ
from Asus don't forget to subscribe for
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos don't forget to like the
video if you liked the video or dislike
it if you don't I don't care and leave a
comment under the video letting me know
why you'd like to disliked it I'll read
it but you know no promises I'll change
anything but I might</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
