is surprisingly professional giving its
gamer roots but don't let it fool you
this five-pound laptop is packin
hardware that would make most desktops
blush with a geforce r-tx 28 Emacs q a6
core intel core i7 8750 h 32 gigs of ram
and one terabyte of raid 0 m2 SSD
storage every single component of this
machine is balls to the wall which
should mean balls to the wall
performance but can you possibly hope to
cool all of that stuff in a chassis this
thin RR TX cards even worth the extra
cost in a laptop can Linus go for just
one video without interrupting the flow
of the content for us sponsor message
the Marlin screwdriver set from I fix it
features five specialty precision
screwdrivers check it out today at
ifixit.com forward slash Linus
so here's the thing see the performance
of a laptop with one of invidious shiny
new r-tx laptop GPUs will vary
significantly depending on the cooling
and the power available so you'll always
get the same number of CUDA and r-tx
course but for the 2080 max-q in
particular the base and the boost clocks
can be all over the place laptop
manufacturers can actually configure
this particular card's power target to
anything from 80 watts all the way up to
over a hundred and fifty watts
that means remember this is according to
Nvidia spec that you could end up with a
base clock of just 735 megahertz
while a properly cooled one would be
capable of boosting to over double that
so what that means is that independent
reviews of this generation of laptops
are gonna be even more important than
ever before
because you cannot compare between
models based on the spec sheet alone so
how did msi then fare taming of the
beast fine I guess
so under a stress test the CPU
immediately jumped up to a hundred
degrees and was forced to throttle down
until its turbo boost ran out of its
Elden around 2.8 gigahertz sustained on
all course which might not sound amazing
and it's not as good as it could be but
it still kicks out a write impressive
1205 score in Cinebench so mobile
professionals take note but also stay
tuned because we're gonna go further in
depth with that in a future video
today's focus is mostly gaming since
this is our first look at mobile r-tx so
let's change gears to 3d Mark's new
portroyal tests treating our eyeballs to
some of the first real-time trace trays
to come out of a laptop and this also
gave us a moment to really appreciate
the 17 inch 1080p display that nside
crammed into what it would have
traditionally been a 15.6 inch laptop
chassis and I got it
save their IPs type panel delivers some
damn good visuals at a hundred and
forty-four Hertz and of course with the
horsepower to back it up really only G
sync and factory calibration are notable
missing features here I can't say like
just overall the industry I love the
move to the super slim bezel 17-inch
displays the difference in immersion
versus a 15.6 inch is palpable now back
to the benchmark we got a score of about
4,000 which at face value met basically
nothing to me since this test hasn't
been around for very long but then upon
further investigation it turns out that
it's roughly 1/3 slower than a desktop
RTX 2080 with a similar cpu and that
lines up pretty nicely with the
reduction in clock speed with the G 75
landing around twelve hundred megahertz
versus 1850 on the desktop card now I
could show you guys a bunch more
benchmarks of a desktop graphics card
expectedly crushing a thin laptop but we
figured it would be a lot more
interesting to compare it to other than
in like gaming laptops which is why the
GS 75 is going to be taking on the
gauntlet of Zephyr is's Zephyr Zephyr I
suffer anyway with the max Q versions of
the gtx 1070 1080 and RTX 2080 all
represented back in the portroyal test
the two r-tx cards completely destroyed
their GTX equivalents partly because the
test won't run on those cards but but
more interestingly the Sephiroth GX 701
pulled out a convincing lead in both the
score and core clock achieved likely
thanks to its superior cooling stay
tuned for our full review of that little
beast even more interestingly though in
3d marks times by benchmark the RT X
cards absolutely wiped the floor with
their last gen competitors turning out a
result that is 30% faster than what
we've ever seen in the thin laptop
before and this kept up past the
synthetics as well which is just great
news for gamers the mobile RT X 2080 is
a freaking beast max Q design or no now
the GS 75 again wasn't quite able to
keep up with the Zephyrus GX 701 but
generally just by a couple of maybe
about five FPS so MSI is leaving some
performance on the table here
perhaps this was in order to maintain a
more conventional keyboard and trackpad
layout or perhaps it was that they tuned
it this way for acoustic reasons
now the GS 75 isn't silent but purr in
videos max-q guidance it's quiet enough
that it's not gonna bother you while
gaming and it's easily overpowered by
its decent onboard speakers so overall
the GS 75 games really freaking well but
what about the whole portability thing
it is a laptop well as much as we're
kind of tired of saying it but MSI just
keeps making us repeat ourselves here
the build quality here just isn't good
enough for a machine that costs $3,000 I
can easily click the trackpad by pushing
the palm rest area and you can feel the
Machine flexing when you're picking it
up like honestly the word we settled on
here was flaccid they do claw back some
points with one of the best assortments
of IL that I've seen in quite some time
with Thunderbolt 3 full-sized HDMI and
Ethernet being the stars of the show
although if you want to be a star you'll
probably need a standalone camera as
this one here isn't going to get too too
many compliments on twitch but I look
like 10 years younger which is nice
that's maybe our biggest gripe about the
GS 75 though is the trackpad it is last
hopped which is good but the flex of the
chassis removes any chance of it having
a solid clicky feel and although I like
where amis I was going with the size
using up almost all of the available
vertical space and giving it this extra
horizontal width they somehow went too
far making it really hard to type
without ending up with a palm resting on
the trackpad causing accidental
activations and when I brought up these
issues at CES and the size reply was
well the trackpad turns off when you
plug in a mouse and although I do expect
the average user of the GS 75 to read
we have a mouse plugged in it's kind of
like dropping your dog off with a friend
when you go on vacation and saying well
Oliver won't in your house at all as
long as you've gotten outside when he
needs to so I just I never thought I'd
say this but until MSI can get their
palm rejection way better they should
stick to smaller track pads now as
mentioned above the worst part of the
keyboard is actually still the trackpad
but once that is disabled it's actually
pretty good the keys have a nice long
stroke with decent feel overall and my
only real gripes here are about the
layout and they're pretty small ones I
just think that these keys up here could
have been better used as dedicated home
and end or media control keys with that
said they can be remapped so removing
the bottom of the device were greeted by
an impressive 82 watt hour battery which
given the power in here is not gonna be
letting you work cordless all day but if
you treat it nicely and you're not
running games or heavy software it gets
you a pretty darn solid five hours of
work time then past the battery we've
got access to three m2 SSD slots making
for very easy storage expansion and RAM
that is well it's technically upgradable
but if you're like oh gee where are the
DIMM slots that's the same thing we were
wondering so our unit has both of the
sodam slots filled already and if we did
want to change them out we'd actually
have to remove everything to get to the
other side of the motherboard bring us
to the bottom line should you buy one of
these now you will be getting one of the
fastest gaming laptops on the market
faster than anything that was released
in 2018 by a fair margin and compared to
the Sepphoris
you get more RAM for $300 less on an
otherwise identically Specht system but
the zephyrus in the real world is faster
and it has g-sync and factory panel
calibration along with noticeably higher
build quality also maybe I'm off base
here but in my mind by the time you're
spending $3,000 I feel like it's not
that much of a stretch to go a little
bit further test 3300 which is why I am
not
recommending that you buy this laptop
but instead recommending that you buy
this laptop except for $2,300 to make
that happen
you do need to drop the specs of it but
there should be more than enough cooling
for an RT X 27 t in here 16 gigs of ram
fits the needs of most people and at
that price I am much more willing to let
slide some of my gripes about the build
quality in exchange for the overall
usability and the great battery capacity
