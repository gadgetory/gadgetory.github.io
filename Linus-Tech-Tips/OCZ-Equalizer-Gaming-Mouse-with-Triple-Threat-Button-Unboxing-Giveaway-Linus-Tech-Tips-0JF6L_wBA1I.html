giveaway to do today
this is an OCC equalizer laser gaming
mouse featuring six DPI and one whatever
that means and the triple threat button
one click three shots for a gaming
advantage okay so why don't we go around
- okay so it's actually rated an FPS
whatever that means 2500 dpi so that's
not even a bad rating even by today's
standards one millisecond delay DPI
modes it's got a lot of different dpi
modes so that's pretty nice and the
omron button
oh but design predominance Omron button
okay uh 2.5 million meters is the most
feet lifetime anyway okay so this is a
really old product you can tell because
when you look at the side of it it says
it still actually says IBM or compatible
PC and windows 98 2000 Emmy and XP
that's what it's compatible that so this
is at least five plus years old so why
don't we get this opened up so equal
wear simulation keyboard game commands
so I have this I have this mouse because
someone from OCC actually came to visit
me and brought it along and I was like
oh okay that's kind of cool can you do a
feature on this I was like do you even
carry this anymore and so they're like
no and I'm like okay well why it what's
the point of featuring it I don't care
just give it away or something so I said
okay I'll give it away so let's have a
look at what we've Wow it smells bad
here cameraman promise isn't that awful
it smells terrible so oh it's like oh
okay well we'll deal with that later so
whoever wins this is also going to be
inheriting a bad smell so first we find
the user's manual okay
this device complies with part 15 locate
and available USB port and trick the USB
port Mouse connector into the USB port
there you go that was pretty easy
okay gives you a little key for how to
tell what UPI you're running at okay
that's enough of that next we have the
driver and normally I would tell you to
install the latest drivers off the occ
website but they not maybe may not have
this Mouse listed on their website
anymore I have
no idea so you might need to install
this dryer next we have some slippy
mouse feet which are compatible with the
mouse excellent so they actually give
you four on the mouse and then two extra
sets which is great because I don't
think you're gonna find anywhere to buy
accessories for this Mouse at this point
ergonomic wise you know what it's
actually not bad
basically you've got your triple threat
button here which is three clicks then
you've got your right and left click you
got your DPI adjustment and your scroll
wheel back and forward buttons you know
what these are a lifesaver if you don't
already have a mouse with back and
forward buttons then you're you're
really missing out it's got like a
rubberized grip here and the rest of it
sort of more plasticky feeling it's
overall not a bad looking product and so
basically the cameraman and I thought
about this and we figured you know what
anyone for anyone to actually win this
mouse and enjoy it they would have to be
using a mouse that's older than this one
is so I'm gonna go ahead and say if you
or anyone you know is still using a ball
mouse okay so one of those mice with the
rubberized heavy ball in the bottom then
please leave a comment under this video
and we are going to randomly draw one of
the people with a comment under this
video and we will award them the OCZ
equalizer mouse as a prize thank you for
participating and you have to be
subscribed to win</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
