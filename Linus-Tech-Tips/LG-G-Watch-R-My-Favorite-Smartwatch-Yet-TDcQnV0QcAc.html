noticed I've been wearing a new
SmartWatch for the last month or so
without reviewing it sorry it's taken so
long but sometimes it does take a while
to get to a particular device because
it's really inconvenient to stop using
it long enough for Brandon to get a
chance to shoot some b-roll I've
actually had a couple of things like
that recently including the O but o
gaming cockpit which is coming soon and
this guy right here welcome to my review
of the LG G watch are my favorite
SmartWatch so far experience silent
performance with the new Coolermaster
Silencio 652 s minimalist design maximum
compatibility click now to learn more so
after reviewing the Moto 360 I resolved
to let Android wear mature a little
until sometime after the Apple watch
launched so I could compare its progress
to Apple's implementation but after
seeing how disappointed I was with the
Moto 360s poor battery life with the
screen in ambient usually on mode with
no option for always-on at all and the
general bugginess of Android wear 4.4
one of my colleagues ed zl-- instead of
getting scared off of Android wear ran
out and bought an LG G watch art which
he declared to be awesome and said that
I should get one too so I did and it
turns out he was right but don't tell
him that the hardware specs are better
than the 360 mostly I mean like anything
it's a trade-off but it's a trade-off
that I happen to like better the G watch
are features a much newer more efficient
and significantly faster processor a 30%
larger 410 million power battery a power
sipping P OLED display that some folks
are concerned about burnin with but
careful selection of watch faces and the
short realistic lifespan of a piece of
tech like this thanks to software
updates and limited battery charge
cycles makes that a bit of a non-issue
for me but some drawbacks to LG's
approach do show up when we look at the
construction the Moto 360 features a
larger display with Gorilla Glass
protecting it and a reasonably nice
leather strap included in the box while
LG relies on the G watch ours thick
bezel
to protect its smaller plastic face and
includes one of the worst leather watch
straps I've ever encountered in my life
although the fact that it can be easily
changed out for any standard 22
millimeters trap like this Kevlar fabric
one that Ed's will picked up for his
without any special tools makes it less
of an issue because that's a great way
to enhance the comfort and style of the
watch to appeal to folks who like velcro
bands metal bands or anything in between
and maybe that's the biggest reason that
I like the G watch are better LG didn't
blow me away with their like space-age
industrial design and great you know
durable material choices but the watch
just plain suits me better and at the
end of the day it's a watch and I have
to wear it the build quality is solid
enough I didn't get any chips or
anything on it in the last month or so
and the round sporty look appeals to my
practical side which I suspect will be
the case for a lot of LG's target
audience for this thing since the folks
who are into super high-end formal dress
watches were unlikely to buy something
that doesn't have mechanical movement
anyway but if you're going to appeal to
practical people then you better provide
some practical functionality right the G
watch R has a heart rate monitor visible
on the bottom of the unit that I didn't
use it all because as long as the old
girls still tick it in there I'm not too
fussed about how fast but it also has
some stuff that does matter to me
including an ip67 ingress protection
rating which you can learn more about
here but in short means that you can't
go scuba diving with it but that would
be stupid anyway because capacitive
touch screens don't work underwater and
only has one physical button on the
right side but in you know your normal
life for normal people it'll keep water
and dust out of the casing for as long
as having a half an hour under a meter
of water it's also got a gyro
accelerometer and compass for step
tracking and motion control with only a
GPS sensor really missing for folks who
want to go running or whatever and not
bring their tethered phone with them now
normally I would cover the software of
the device at this point in the review
but Android wear is I mean it's the same
on every device that runs it and it just
doesn't really do that much I mean you
can put apps on it you can
custom watch faces on it both of which I
demo in the Moto 360 review which you
can watch here but if you're buying this
device so you can use a wrist size
internet browser instead of a
pocket-sized one then you're definitely
missing the point Android wear devices
are for lightning-fast notifications of
reminders upcoming events and messages
quick hands-free memo creation and
replies to emails and texts and hangout
messages turn-by-turn navigation for
folks who don't have a car dock for
their phone telling the time on-screen
music control and for me very
importantly letting you know when you
leave your phone behind somewhere
because it loses the connection and that
aside from some frustrations like poor
support from third-party applications
like Twitter which in some cases won't
even let you read a notification
properly much less open it on the phone
or heaven forbid interact with it
through the watch and Google now's
laughable predictions for cards that I'd
like to see and finally the weak media
controls that Barry you know your music
control under other cards and totally
needs to be revamped is what the G watch
R does so it's getting a glowing review
from me but Linus the modal 360 does
that stuff too and you were pretty harsh
on it how much is LG paying you
great question nothing by the way but I
actually noticed the difference in tone
for this review too and I was rewatching
my Moto 360 video and reading this one
to prep for this and I was pretty down
on that device for some stuff that in
retrospect seems pretty minor doesn't it
for some reason I accept one and a half
days of battery now actually once I got
to which was nice I accept the
proprietary charger doc that doesn't
even have a handy-dandy bedside mode and
isn't even a cool Wireless one this time
and I accept the general quirkiness of
Android wear so it took me a while to
nail this down but at the end of the day
I think the reason the G watch R gives
me so many warm fuzzies and will remain
on my wrist now that I'm done with this
review is that I can use it as much as I
want have my screen always on so I can
always see the time even without a goofy
gesture and still get that one and a
half days of battery that I need that's
where the Moto 360 failed me and that's
where the Apple watch has already failed
me if the
internal battery life targets are
anywhere close to true a watch needs to
be a functional watch first before it
can get my attention for all the other
little tricks it does which is why I
tolerated pebbles
you know truncated email notifications
so willingly up until now because it was
a watch first and it did all that other
stuff
well now Android wear has a wat that it
runs on to one that still needs Google
to get their crap together on a few
things replying to email for example on
the watch leaves it unread in my inbox
for some reason but it's still the best
wearable experience I've had so far and
I heartily recommend it assuming you've
got as much as you'd spend on a decent
smartphone to spend on a watch so that's
pretty much it guys like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment if your feelings are
more complicated than this as always we
have a link in the video description
where you can buy a cool t-shirt like
this one give us a monthly contribution
if you want us to keep making videos
change your amazon bookmark to one with
