brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful so here at the Sony booth
they've got all the usual stuff they've
got their smartphones with image
stabilization cameras and 4k screens
they've got their 4k cameras actually
one of which for shooting this video on
right now but that's all stuff we're
pretty familiar with and I was looking
for something a little bit different and
I definitely found it
this is a mesh which stands for make
experience and share the S&amp;amp;H kind of got
worked in together there and the concept
is actually quite simple if you're a
member of the maker community but what I
like about it too is the fact that
they've made operating this thing simple
as well so basically you've got a
variety of these little these little
Bluetooth connected modules here that
have an array of different functionality
so this little puppy is an LED this one
right here is a button it's called
button so it should be fairly
self-explanatory this one is a motion
sensor we've got their move which is
actually a six axis gyroscope a
brightness sensor a temperature and
humidity sensor and a general purpose
i/o module that can be used to do things
like hook up a vibration motors say for
example what ties it all together the
mesh if you will is the iPad and iPhone
app that lets you create if this then
that if you're familiar with if if this
then that recipes that work together
with the mesh system as well as
third-party systems like Philips hue so
the number of combinations you can
create without any programming
experience whatsoever is pretty much
limitless you just drag your modules
over to your you know virtual circuit
board and you start going okay well if I
double click my button then I want my
snowman to light up purple if I click it
once I want my snowman to turn off and
that's obviously a very rudimentary
example they've got another demo here
inside the booth where you open up a
drawer and you're greeted with a hello
and the lights turn on and you're ready
to sit at your work table I mean this is
really really cool stuff because it's
limited only by your imagination
obviously there's usually a drawback
when something is both really cool and
really easy to use and it isn't exactly
cheap a single one of these modules is
going to set you back but maybe not
Samantha's on or for some of the more
premium ones like the gpio $60 on
amazon.com but the possibilities in the
future are pretty much endless because
they're already providing an SDK and
it's an open API so people are going to
be able to do pretty much anything they
want with it including hook into it from
all kinds of other systems right now
it's pretty much Philips U and if this
then that and the app itself with the
modules but I see a lot of potential for
this kind of stuff in the future because
the thing I've been complaining about
for so long with Internet of Things
devices is that they just don't all
really work together there's no
ecosystem that ties it all together and
while this isn't necessarily the perfect
solution because it does rely on having
a Bluetooth enabled tablet nearby I'd
love to see a second gen be Wi-Fi
enabled with a controller that can run
on a computer a dedicated device and it
feels like now that we've got this we
are not that far away so thanks for
checking out this coverage of mesh here
at the Sony booth guys don't miss any of
our CES coverage over on youtube.com
slash Linus tech tips and as always a
huge shout out to Squarespace for
allowing us to be here at the show if
you guys are looking to be able to
beautiful build a beautiful website
