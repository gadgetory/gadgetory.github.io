Digital one terabyte green hard drive
and again I'm doing a hard drive I know
that's not exactly the most popular
thing to unbox but the reason for it is
that this is a fairly unique hard drive
so I mean the reason I'm unboxing it is
actually because I needed to go buy one
today because one of the drives died in
my Windows Home Server so the reason I
chose the green one and since I'm
actually telling you about something I
picked with my own hard-earned money is
because a it is green okay so what that
means is that use has lower power
consumption than most of the other
drives on the market while still
offering reasonably good performance for
a storage application like a Windows
Home Server or an external hard drive
enclosure and how it achieves that is it
actually has onboard circuitry that
tells it which rpm to run at in order to
maintain a certain power envelope and a
certain heat output so you can see it
has a standard SATA interface at the
back so that's a SATA 2 data and a SATA
2 power and then on the top of the drive
you can see the label is green and thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
WD green one terabyte drive I'm going to
go install this in my home server now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
