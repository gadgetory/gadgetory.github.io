my daily driver phone not thanks to its
slim sexy design outstanding camera or
timely Android updates but rather
because of its massive 3900 milliamp
hour battery because while there might
be things about the Droid turbo that
suck timid it can suck all day and for
some of us that's where the search for a
companion device ends but there is
another way to skin that particular cat
and that's where today's device the
Xperia z5 compact gets very interesting
in addition to the tried and true strap
more doublea's to its strategy sony has
made some interesting hardware choices
that could just turn this device a spot
in my front pocket for good
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more let's start with the physical
overview because the xperia z5 compact
is completely less unlike any flagship
class phone that i've put my hands on
and has it been 5 years since I made
this video I bought an iPhone 4 it's
actually small enough for me to operate
it with one hand so at the front you'll
find a 4.6 inch IPS touchscreen along
with a 5.1 megapixel 1080p selfie camera
a Sony logo and wah dual front-facing
speakers ok they're not amazingly loud
and they're kind of tinny sounding with
less stereo separation than a larger
device would have but this comes with
the territory when you make the speaker
smaller and closer together and clarity
particularly of dialogue was a very
strong point compared to other devices
I've used recently but then again these
speakers are up against speakers that
fire into your palm and firing into your
palm has never been a successful
strategy on the back is a flash and a 23
megapixel rear camera featuring a Sony
sensor and recording modes ranging from
4k at 30fps through 1080p at 60 and 720p
at 120 and then really not much else
unless you count the orange dbrand skin
on there at the top and bottom are a
couple of mics for noise cancellation a
headphone jack and a micro bead charging
port I sure wish this had been type-c on
the right is the power button that
doubles as an adequate if not especially
fast or accurate fingerprint sensor an
unusually positioned volume rocker that
had any kind of scratching my head until
I'd used the phone for a while and
realized that having it out of the way
like this is perfect the only reason
that I'm messing around with the volume
button on all my other phones is to
reset it when I accidentally press the
damn thing so Bravo Sony on that one and
then finally there's also a dedicated
camera button that was a total pleasure
to use especially once I figured out
that it had a half press so I can lock
in my focus and exposure before quickly
snapping the shot on the left side
you'll find a wrist strap loop if you're
into hanging jewels off your phone or
whatever and a watertight flap that
helps the phone achieve its ip68 ingress
protection rating making it
theoretically safe to have exposed to
fresh or even chlorinated water for
short periods of time but with that said
I wouldn't bet your $500 investment
given Sony's recent backpedaling act on
just how safe it is to use your device
under water under that flap we'll find a
nano SIM slot and Wow another surprise a
micro SD slot now in some cases we're
reasonably priced higher capacity models
exist
I don't consider SD expansion a huge
deal but since we're talking about a
phone here that records 4k video and
only has 32 gigs of internal storage I
see this as a huge boon for potential
buyers and on that note I guess we
haven't actually done the whole spec
thing yet have we
it's pretty darn similar to its Big
Brother's the z5 and the z5 premium with
the Snapdragon 810 eight core CPU
beating at its heart at two gigahertz on
the for more powerful course that
throttled pretty decisively during
synthetic tests but at least had the
decency to stay cool during normal
operation and an Adreno 430 graphics
processor for RAM we're looking at a
middling two gigs of ddr3 l we've got
the usual array of wireless tech with
Bluetooth AC Wi-Fi and FM radio and
inside is a 27 hundred million power
battery not that exceptional sounding
but there's more here than meets the eye
so let's get back to the screen for a
minute Sony went all modern flagship on
some aspects of this phone with the
reduction in system memory from three
gigs in the full-size models being one
of the main spec differences but for the
screen Sony went with a very
conservative 720p LCD and I know this
might be confusing to regular viewers
who are used to me saying more is better
give me more but I actually love this
decision that's still a very respectable
323 pixels per inch about equivalent to
Apple's Retina display standard and the
lower resolution combined with the
smaller size
means that the z5 compact performed as
well or better than the Droid turbo in
my about how much battery do I have left
at the end of each day test with usually
anywhere from fifteen to thirty percent
left in the tank even after demanding
days with long phone calls and even
moderate GPS use absolutely fantastic
not that going back to a small screen
didn't have its drawbacks
Sony opted for on screen buttons
something I liked when holding the phone
in landscape mode but eats up valuable
screen real estate for every improvement
to the content consumption experience
that I got from those front-facing
speakers the smaller screen really
clawed some of it back and that I had
really forgotten how much space gets
taken up by the number row in SwiftKey
and suggested websites in a browser when
you have so much less space to work with
sony software fortunately didn't make
life more difficult the minimum text
size freed up some room and overall even
though the marshmallow update hasn't
arrived yet I was pleased by the
responsiveness the visual style and the
options provided in the settings menu
there was nothing that really stood out
to me is like wow so d this is like
super dumb which I guess leads us to the
camera to be clear it's not the iPhone 6
or 6s and it's not the galaxy s6 edge
both of which offer faster camera amp
launch times faster shutter speeds and
faster saving times for pictures taken
mid video and completed video files but
the dedicated shutter button helps a
fair bit with this and the photo results
while not optically stabilized were good
enough in most situations I think if I
was designing the phone I might choose a
less wide lens so I don't have to stand
like three feet from a given subject but
all in all it's a fairly minor complaint
which leads us to conclusion time there
are some things I'm going to miss about
my old daily driver taking the
downgrades that come with our upgrades
is one of the crosses that we Android
people have to bear
like the gestures to launch the
flashlight then they work and camera
there we go and the Notification peak
feature but overall the easy one-handed
operation waterproofness and improved
camera while retaining outstanding
battery life have won me over I just
can't wait to see what the marshmallow
update and the new updated camera app
bring to the table because I'm already
loving this phone speaking of loving
your phone D brand skins they make these
awesome vinyl covers so you can practice
safe phone love they not only make your
phone look better you can choose from a
wide variety of different skins and
styles and use the configurator on their
site to check out all the different
options but they also protect it from
incidental bumps and scratches now to be
clear you drop it screen down your D
brand skin is not going to do anything
but if you're carrying it around in your
pocket and you don't want it to get all
scratched and scuffed a skin can be a
perfect and low-cost option to keep your
phone looking like the day it was new
and they do more than just phones D
brand offer skins for game controllers
consoles and even some computers and
this is pretty cool coming very soon
deep brand is going to be doing a
limited edition run of kind of an LTT
color carbon fiber orange actually it's
the same as the one that you saw on
scrapyard war season 3 so stay tuned for
that so check them out over at D brand
comm slash whatever I'm sure will have a
link below me and it'll be linked in the
video description and check out what
your device will look like with one of
their precision cut gorgeous vinyl skins
