finally it's been a little bit finally
finally doing it sorry this took so long
but we're pretty excited so today we are
going to actually pour mineral oil into
the computer this is not how it's done
imagine the cap is flew off no you have
to be actually be like fairly careful
about it but we'll get to that part yeah
so uh come along for the ride
the coolermaster Neptune 240m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more so I guess we have to figure out
this and forget the bank element a kill
management the back have to figure out
the rocks and we have to do the plant
stuff in the rocks he's looking down at
your rocks yeah okay yeah okay there
further actually pretty small but
there's a lot there's a really a
globally large amount of them there okay
so basically this needs to plug in like
kind of kind of arish right ish it'll be
lower than that but yeah and then they
can bury it under the rocks as far as we
can correct yeah and then we want like a
nice straight run coming out
this oh boy
I remember this being the challenge I
remembering we should probably do it
with the bench laying on its back
I remember thinking we should only do
this one we should mount it from the top
I can do it I can do it I can do I could
do it I can do it dog here we go
that was a good snap as it was yes this
is reattached graphics card is back in
this is cable manners
right wall
you mean clearance with the fans yeah
yeah unless the double-sided tape makes
it tall enough that it doesn't matter no
it's not the thing yeah let's just go
we'll go on the other side so but how
long do you need to be like that yeah
okay I'll just keep this sure one we'll
make our own fan controller the
double-sided tape and scissors yeah and
an SSD and blackjack
yeah but with a knife oh my goodness
there's snips here there was scissors
around not that long ago and he's still
going
fans don't plug in that way powered
power and data don't plug in this way so
we need it like no cuz that has to go
flush against it doesn't it and now we
thought we had such a great idea many
fans we have four does it look dead or
does it look cool sometimes it's a fine
line ghetto all right all right here we
go money truth time you had a lot of
moments of truth that's what makes a
good bill boat Wow yeah it bends to hell
but I might be willing to make that
sacrifice oh this is like the most awful
thing that I've done to a piece of
hardware in quite sighs this is awful
this isn't get owing it this is just
poor planning so you know how people
were kind of complaining about the blue
Oz of time yes yeah so I figure out how
we can balance that out are we gonna put
oh no way
awesome yeah nice now it's like light
blue dark blue pink and red and black
and silver and silver and these antic
fans are some color I gotta warn you in
advance I had like some wicked gasps oh
so I'm gonna have to choose I thought
there's like some legitimate like
there's some crippling issue with the
build or something no that is kind of a
crippling issue yeah the build is fine
well it's not crippling yet nothing
nothing's happened yet but if I have to
choose between mild food mild stomach
discomfort for me it's like horrible oh
okay yeah yeah so just be prepared be
prepared because I won't be sparing you
did you purposely loose this yeah yeah
okay so what we get to do we get a gonna
kill them into the back of this okay and
then money you start on that and we're
getting pretty close this is what
happens when you send Nick to buy
anything I said I needed some cotton
balls and it like three six
but by 600 yes and yes
no I guess it's oh no that's terrible
are they exactly the same like no oh not
quite shorter oh we're losing like not
much yeah I think that's like a quarter
of an inch all right that's not too bad
yeah this is my dreams they've broken my
dreams of the correct length a bubble
machine
this might take a while I feel like I'm
playing excavator and I'm like 9 it's
like they didn't want impacts when we're
both like jumping from the top yeah so I
give up okay so this is just a lower
down test fit right yes for the roads
yep looks like I'm good okay so it's
still up on things
okay so rads are there rats are also
there
oh that graphics card is this all the
way down yeah okay
you
so to add some positives and negatives
with this one the great is right at the
top essentially like there's a little
bit of a lip but not much yeah and
there's possibility of going inside
where you plug your ATX power right
this one you're pouring into the case
and yeah it deals with it right so if
you want to not get oil and you actually
we should probably put some stuff down
I'm not even kidding do you have do you
have garbage bags we have newspaper
we have copious amounts of newspaper
it's like not gonna care about your
newspaper not ideal solution welcome to
Linus Media Group where ideal solutions
are not solutions because they're
suspensions you're suspended I'm not
gonna fire you anymore just suspend you
okay Oh
all's well everything is okay oh my god
without a better conclusion so we broke
both the rads and the back of the
computer
okay so this is it moment Rita for make
sure you don't miss but then also make
sure you don't go too quickly there you
go you want to see if it's disrupting
the rock I don't think it is getting
laid the canvassed I will no it's fine
it would probably kill you if you could
see it but it's fine yeah I'm missing
everything yep
this is a harder shot he goes in for the
three points will hit yep
I've poured water before so that helps
ah I splashed that's okay I got this
there's something to this it's not do we
need to snip those things then maybe
holy crap
Oh - and then then that pulls out you
pull this out right yep no I'm good I'm
good I got it
splashed my face it's okay little
mineral oil is good for the complexion
mm-hmm I wonder actually
oh no no they were so close
Oh terrible okay well okay dang it I'm
going in just don't drop the paper just
Gigi Oh a piece of it went in Oh No
hold on I wonder if we can retreat it Oh
like a stick or something tell me if I
if I'm get rid of one Oh God
you don't want it yeah I get it oh shoot
okay that's one good no but I gotta pull
this one out
they're home free
I think captured you you bastard you
bastard
got it all right
probably okay there I got you a little
bit of the fill line cuz we're still
leaning forward a little bit okay okay
so hold on a second so the fan on the
power supply is like right yeah at the
top and this one's about the same and
then this one's about the same like it's
just barely coming out um are they gonna
like whip it around you don't think it's
gonna throw it but you'll have a little
bit of like turn meet a turbulent pickup
that should be okay should be depending
on how fast the fan spins I didn't have
fans that were that close but the only
experience I have of this is I could
turn my pump off externally so when I
say line up I would have my pump off so
it would go through fans and when it
first touches them they just throws it
all freaking over the place but I never
had it like really permanently where
it's right near the edge so we'll see
you'll probably be flying right you
should see how the bubble maker works
though yeah cuz if we need to adjust
because we can turn the fans off on the
graphics card using custom curves and
afterburner or just very low won't be
able to do that this second right cuz we
have to get everything working power
supply we can turn off immediately it
has a switch on the back for the hybrid
mode eco motor yeah okay well let's
let's see the bubbles first okay oh the
bug we're gonna see the bubbles without
the lights I guess well okay we'll add
lights later okay I want a good angle at
this I had to do that I poured the
mineral oil so I didn't get to see any
of it I don't have to watch my own video
there's a screw hanging out of the pump
oh no it's okay oh my goodness it is
amazing good how clear the acrylic yeah
it's yeah I was like one of the screws
holding the top on is hanging out that's
what I was telling a Nick Burkle is that
everything looks extremely clean litter
looks super clean look at the Gretton
look at the metal on the graphics card
yeah it looks perfect
Wow because it is constantly oiled it's
like you oiled up something sort of look
cool and then left it that way forever
all right fine carry on oh my goodness I
freaked right out the bubbles are
awesome
so I'm a little bit on the Opie side I
think we got like the one for
circulating the water in the aquarium
you know yeah which is probably good
because circulating mineral will help
but it's a little bit overpowering so
yeah move that back a lot and that's
going to be a huge process or we buy a
different pump yeah cuz we tried we
tried kinking it and if you can't get
like hardcore then it's probably
reasonable yeah okay but are you are you
ready to power up the actual computer
let's do this
it came with a right-angle power cable
so we need to find that because that's
going to be he says that as if it's his
idea he was like do you have a right
angle power cable and I'm like yeah let
me go grab it it came with one and then
Brennan is like oh I'm not filming yet
so I just want to set the record
straight about how that happened that
adds a lot of good quality content to
the video - I'm happy that you took the
viewers time explaining that okay so
this is it if it doesn't post now then I
might as well just end it all shut down
linus media group hiding in a mountain
just completely quit i kind of hope it
doesn't no I seriously though that would
make a really interesting next video we
have to like garbage bag off this whole
area nothing like oh get like giant
rubber gloves we'd probably have to wear
like a garbage bags over our legs and
tape them to our legs oh my goodness
okay haul it out put it in so bad do you
want to do the honors uh no man this is
on you earning out mine okay here we go
okay the pumps sucking up the oil still
not over here it's going across here yep
come on it's still flowing there we go
postcodes are still going we're out the
other side he has a boil now yep
postcode 9562 so those fans look fine CA
- I think a - is a good sign is this
monitor on yes yes yes yes there it is
oh no part no part whatever the part
that was gonna be the cleaning out part
series we might have to move the air
thing which one now remember you said
moving the Oh moving the bubble maker
yeah we're not gonna do that if the
bubble maker doesn't doesn't please me
then I will turn it off we'll see you in
a couple months I'll try to convince him
if you guys wanted to I want another one
all those bubbles are hiding under the
pacifier looks good just chilling down
there it looks like a beta egg farm 26
degrees Celsius all right man
happy yeah this is uh this is pretty
great actually
wait the grid works hey you are they all
already yeah how all the fans already
completely forgot about that yes yeah oh
yeah the SSD will be fine
no the I think you meant when we split
Oh
so we have officially built and posted
the oil-cooled machine it's kind of
freaking awesome it brings a tear to my
eye
you don't want to do it for a super long
time and he was super like not okay with
it when you first started pouring oil
but after a while yeah yeah pour that
oil speaking of pouring oil we actually
have a sponsor for today's episode
phantom glass so if you guys aren't
familiar with phantom glass already
basically it's like mineral oil for your
phone it is nothing like mineral oil for
your phone it's okay
it's mineral oil for your phone in the
sense that remember the spots inside
that Lake it made it so you couldn't see
them yeah yeah okay phantom glass is
made from Gorilla Glass just like the
glass that's already on your phone it
uses a nano material in order to make it
so there are absolutely no bubbles
between it in your phone and because
it's made of Gorilla Glass it is as
strong as the glass that's already on
your phone on top of feeling the same
and being just as clear and because it's
so thin you can actually use third-party
protective cases for the rest of your
phone as well it really is the best
screen protector that we have ever
encountered over here we're both like
pretty strong advocates for phantom
glass so big thumbs up it never peels
and you can take it off and reapply it
if you want which actually came in handy
for me when I had to RMA my HTC One m8
so there you go thank you to Phantom
glass for sponsoring this episode it's a
store phantom blast com if you guys want
to check it out and other than that I
guess all that's left is more teasers
more tease more teasers because we are
going to do an episode four of mineral
oil we'll try not to have it take as
long but the machine is built this is it
it's done but what we still need to do
is overclock this puppy - and it
overclocked it yeah how hot it is under
idle because that actually is a much
different conversation than an air
cooled computer because instead of yeah
figuring out your average idle
temperatures in like 10 minutes it's
going to take a long time because you
have to let all the oil hit a mean
temperature yeah we'll have to figure
out the temperatures under load yeah
Bubba bla yeah there's a bunch of
science that'll be done so pretty pretty
excited and of course we need to do some
our glam footage of the finished machine
just to show it off in all of its glory
so thank you guys for watching like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if your
feelings were more complicated than any
of this as always there's a link in the
video description to support us you can
check out our sponsor you can buy a cool
