popular demand welcome to our video on
display fusion if you're wondering how
to acquire display fusion I would highly
recommend getting it through steam where
it is $29.99 although it goes on still
quite often I believe I got mine at
around $7.99 and that was a pretty good
deal that's why I don't necessarily
remember it's not too big deal to me
the main reason why I like display
fusion is you can have different
independent backgrounds on each monitor
I personally run three different screens
usually so it's nice to be able to have
independent backgrounds because I just
find it more interesting you know so
stretch backgrounds or you can have the
same back on in each one it doesn't
really matter it's quite flexible in
that way my other favorite thing is that
you can have task bars on every monitors
so you have your windows taskbar and
then you have on all your other monitors
you can have Display fusion task bars
where you can pin whatever you want and
they still have Aero peak functionality
another great thing about these is if
you're on your display fusion taskbar
and you right-click on a window you have
additional functionality so you can
click on span across all monitors or you
can click on move monitor to move window
to next monitor so you can just flip
things around as you go and it makes
everything a much more enjoyable much
faster experience another thing you can
do can do is have multiple screen savers
on each one of your screens which I'm
really not into but if you want to do
that you can now if you're into
tinkering with software and want to get
a little bit more functionality out of
it you can go to the functions tab
inside of the display fusion settings
window and set any key combination to a
huge arrangement of different functions
that you can do my favorite one is move
window to center of monitors so that's
control windows key q and it just pops
whatever window you're currently on into
the middle of your monitor there's a
huge amount of other ones and you can
set those to clickable buttons in the
top left hand corner of the window so
right here I can just have that which is
move window to next display so you saw
that through over to the TV very very
quickly and if I double middle if I
middle click the title bar it will also
move it to next
monitor that is default functionality
though and not a key combination so it's
just nice little extra things that are
built into it so here's something I
really didn't find that useful but you
might if you grab the title bar of a
window and move it to the next one it
you can if it's maximized it will remac
summize on the other side but the reason
why I don't find it all that crazy
useful is I can do that anyways and just
put it on the top of the monitor and
then it maximizes anyway so it's kind of
already built in but it might be a
little bit faster for you this way if
you're very nitpicky about over
organizing your windows you can enable a
tooltip that will show you the size and
location of your windows at all points
in time while you drag them around which
is very nice another thing you can do is
specify default window locations for
when your computer starts up so
something I have done is I set Skype I
have two skypes at all points in time so
I set up Skype so that when I first
turned my computer on on my left monitor
not my main monitor I have one Skype on
one side and my other Skype on the other
side so I can constantly monitor all my
chats another tool to help you manage
your Windows location is snapping so you
can set in the snapping option inside of
the display fusion settings window you
can stat snapping distance I have it set
at 10 which seems very natural for me
and then if you move windows around
they'll snap against each other which is
kind of nice because it helps you
organize things actually use this all
the time not everything will work with
snapping properly like my Razer comms
window which is a very custom UI
stylized window will not snap properly
to other windows but default windows
windows and steam will all kind of snap
to each other which is quite nice this
isn't necessarily useful to me but if
you're a laptop power user that has a
dock it's a work you can have monitor
profiles and icon profiles so when you
plug in the new monitor sometimes the
resolutions messed up or it's on or it
thinks it's on the wrong side and your
icons go all over the place you can have
two individual profiles they can link
into each other so if you set a monitor
profile they can automatically grab your
icon profile so you go to work click on
the work profile and everything
automatically configures itself exactly
how you want it to be so you're playing
a game and your icons are all messed out
because of some weird resolution that
you had to play inside the game if all
your icons are messed up just click on
your profile everything will be fine you
might notice a lot of these features
are mainly good for people at ease in
Windows 7 display fusion also has
features for people using Windows 8 one
of them is a bypass to go right to your
desktop although they suggest using
classic start which also has that
functionality so that's a little bit
redundant to that point but the coolest
thing in their Windows 8 features that I
have noticed is they have a mini modern
UI window so if you do end up going if
you in classic start you can enable so
you can still get to modern UI if you do
want that but don't want it to
completely take over your screen you can
have a mini little modern UI at almost
any size that you want it's very
customizable and then you can use it
there it still looks kind of nice but
personally I wouldn't use that at all
just completely bypass modern UI because
I don't like it the power user menu in
Windows 8 kind of opens in one specific
spot you can teleport it to your mouse
cursor by pressing Windows X and then
that's about it for Windows 8 users but
it's still quite nice for many things
displayed Fusion integrates really
really well with Windows if you
right-click on your desktop you can
access desktop wallpaper monitor
configuration or just general settings
but if you're a power user like I'm
assuming many of you are you can dive
deeper into all the different menus and
get a lot more out of this program I've
covered many things throughout this
video but there's still tons that I
haven't been able to go through and if
you're going to sit down and spend the
time to set up everything exactly how
you want it it'll take some time but
it'll save you time in the long run if
you're worried about backing up all your
stuff they have that functionality you
can backup your settings to a reg file
and then restore them if you have a
reformat your computer or move to a
different desktop with sim with a
similar setup thank you for watching our
display fusion
now average normal with this cuz that
was good otherwise you're watching
artists play fusion video and I'm going
to leave before Linus shoots me no you
got it right and I don't have to like
yeah yeah seriously
