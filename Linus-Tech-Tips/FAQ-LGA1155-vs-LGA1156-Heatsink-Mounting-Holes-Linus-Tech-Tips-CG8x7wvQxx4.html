going to see an LGA 1156 motherboard
this is the old P 7 P 55 de premium so
this is a Linfield socket or it's a core
i3 Core i5 core i7 whatever you want to
call it this is an LGA 1156 motherboard
with LGA 1156 mounting holes and an LGA
1156 keep out zone so the the keep out
zone is what Intel specifies as the
minimum amount of space around the
socket where there can't be anything
there all right on my left side I have a
brand new LGA 1155 motherboard so this
is with an 1155 socket it supports the
new core I series two chips so that is
if you have a core i7 2600
- so LGA 1155 despite having fewer pins
than 1156 is actually an upgraded
platform ok now normally when Intel
upgrades their platform and they change
the socket like when we saw 1366 - 1156
they actually change the spacing of the
mounting holes however the good news is
that if you are shopping for a new 1155
system you're buying a motherboard
you're buying a CPU and you're trying to
figure out if you need to upgrade your
cooler I have some really good news for
you this is an LGA 1156 cooler and this
is me putting it on an LGA 1155
motherboard just like that the hole
spacing let's look at that random the
hole spacing as you can see is exactly
the same the stock cooler uses the same
plastic push pins as LGA 1156 and we
even have the same hold down mechanism
and the same backplate I'm gonna flip
the board over again and the same black
backplate that we found on LGA 1156 so
you'll actually see if I flip this over
there you go these are using exactly the
same hardware on the back
the board so there are no changes and
the TDPS that is the thermal output of
the processors on both platforms are
actually very similar so if you have one
that's rated for a high-end 1156 chip
odds are 100% that it's going to work
just fine with a high-end 11:55 tip so
don't fear you do not have to upgrade
your cooler that is my Linus tech tip
for the day don't forget to subscribe

reviews and other good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
