product to arrive and for there to be a
bit of a learning curve for me before I
can use it well enough to be able to do
a review what's not normal is for the
aforementioned
new product to be a freaking battery
powered unicycle that takes longer to
learn than anything that I have ever
covered before on this channel
well almost longer whole room water
cooling part seven the stunning
conclusion is actually in the pipeline
so drop a like if you're excited to
finally see the end of that particular
journey
Corsair delivers real mech or nothing
with their new strafe mechanical
keyboard featuring genuine German made
Cherry MX key switches click on this
keyboard here to learn more let's start
with the unboxing experience inside the
package I found the self-balancing
unicycle or SBU Version three an
alternate seat height shaft a charger a
set of keys and finally the manual take
my advice
leave everything in the box except the
manual read it cover-to-cover
twice before you even consider plugging
in the sbu let alone powering it on it
contains all wealth of critical tips and
tricks like never lift the sbu off the
ground while operating it or it'll spaz
the crap out and spin it full-speed
trying to balance itself oh and my
personal favorite if you're too cool for
safety gear then you are too cool for
the SBU because this thing is flat-out
dangerous in the hands of an
irresponsible person who is going too
fast for control without appropriate
safety gear which isn't to say it can't
be written safely it's just that the SBU
is less of a you know child's electric
toy and more of a tool or a vehicle so
it needs to be treated as such let's
take a tour it features aluminum alloy
construction to keep weight down to
allow for its 122 watt our internal
battery pack the single metal rimmed
tire should be inflated prior to use for
best results closer to the rated maximum
will result in better rolling efficiency
and easier twisting for balance but a
bit less cushion as you travel more on
that later on the sides of the wheel are
two folding foot rests at the very top
is the cushioned seat that can be bolted
to either the longer or shorter shaft in
a few minutes to accommodate different
rider heights
I used the shorter one then at the base
of the shaft is the power input jack
power button and the lock that overrides
the power button lock your sbu if you
have kids or a particularly dexterous
pet rabbit alright so I think I've
talked enough about that let's move on
to actually using the thing the first
time out I got geared right the crap up
I wore my motorbiking equipment except
the helmet and there is a good reason
the SPU's top speed is 20 km/h not as
much of a problem on something like an
electric skateboard but as someone who
has fallen off one of those at that
speed in the past I realized that from a
sitting position the tumble would be
much more difficult to control so I took
it really slow like glacier slow some
good tips here also in the manual don't
grab on to the seat you'll fall over
pretty much instantly you steer by and
balance by twisting not by leaning you
want to look to the horizon rather than
on the ground in front of you you want
to put your arms out for balance like a
tightrope walker and don't be
discouraged if you don't get it right
away
I hit my first milestone moving about 10
feet in a straight line without putting
my feet down on the first day but it
actually wasn't until my second and
third attempts that I really managed to
start using the SPU's speed control it's
super intuitive lean forward to go lean
more to go faster and then lean back to
slow down using its regenerative braking
stop and even eventually go backwards if
you go too fast the sbu will correct you
by leaning itself back until you aren't
able to lean forward any more I read
about this in the manual and it sounded
like the kind of thing that causes an
accident but the first time it happened
it didn't throw me off at all literally
or figuratively by the fifth outing I
was feeling pretty comfortable on the
SPU false starts still happens sometimes
because much like with a bicycle it's
considerably easier to balance while
you've got some forward momentum but at
this stage I had gotten to the point
where I could go out on a walk with my
family and move at the same speed as my
wife with the stroller so we could
actually carry a conversation instead of
me just scooting ahead because otherwise
I'd tip over on the sbu so that's all
there is to it I guess um should you buy
one it's certainly cool it samples data
at an impressive 1,000 times per second
from its accelerometer and gyro and uses
its torque tastic electric motor the
same one that tackled the local hills as
if they were nothing and not
could find one can apparently drive up a
30% grade to automatically correct
forward and backward balance relying on
the user to balance side to side it
draws attention like few things I've
ever seen before and I was the kid in
high school bearing in mind this was 15
years ago before everyone in a grandma
was doing it with the fluorescent pink
spiky hairdo so when you're rocking it
and looking cool on the sbu people are
definitely noticing that and when you're
still learning or you wipe out
accidentally people notice that too so
it's one heck of a double-edged sword of
a conversation starter but back to that
question should you could you buy one
the answer unfortunately is in my
opinion not unless you really want to
spend this kind of money on something
that in my mind is effectively a toy
wait a second Linus you said earlier
that it's not a toy and aren't you the
very person who argued that the Seaboard
electric skateboard a similar gadget in
many respects was actually justifiable
yes I did say those things so let me
clarify it's not a toy in the sense that
it's power innovative design and build
quality vastly exceed that of any toy
I've ever seen but it is a toy in the
sense that it's just not very practical
I'll give focused designs this the fact
that it can be operated in the rain
makes it usable more days out of the
year than my Z board and for the type of
vehicle it is the SPU's speed and range
are astounding an average male could
travel quickly about 15 kilometers one
way charge it for a mere hour and then
get home 15 kilometers again but the
main thing stopping me from recommending
the sbu is that I can't think of any
reason that I would want to ride it that
far and for that long it's just not
comfortable nor is it easy enough to use
for me to consider it a relaxing mode of
transportation
I've got a few hours of writing under my
belt and I am able to use it but I can
tell you it would require a lot more
work to trust myself anywhere near other
people and much worse than that
even once you master it the SBU has no
shocks or suspension system whatsoever
so every bump on the ground is basically
like being punched between the hands so
while the people writing these things
backwards solving Rubik's cubes at the
same time is proof that with more
practice they are easier to ride the
comfort factor is the big reason why if
given the choice I'll take a standing
electric vehicle for my daily commute
versus the SBU yeah I can't think of a
Segway so speaking of absolutely nothing
Squarespace simple powerful beautiful
websites whether you want to create one
about like you know the tricks that you
can do on your SBU or whether you want
to create one about you know SBU related
accessories that you want to sell or
whether you just want to create like a
portfolio site whatever kind of site you
want to create they've got 24/7 support
via live chat and email it starts at
only $8 a month you get a free domain if
you sign up for a year they've got a
whack ton of beautiful templates and
easy to use tools like seriously it's so
easy to use that when ensel put some
frankly quite racist stuff in the
contacts or in the our team page of our
website I was able to go in and fix it
without waiting around for him to fix it
just in case anyone actually saw it
seriously our new guy he had something
in there about how he can barely speak
English I'm like really dude really so I
pulled that down thanks to Squarespace I
don't remember what I was saying about
that anymore so guys basically you're
going to want to visit Squarespace calm
and use offer code Lynas to save 10% on

can check out by clicking that little
eye in the top right corner and I guess
that's pretty much it thanks again for
watching and I'll see you again next
time it's going to be my new catchphrase
it's probably never been number four</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
