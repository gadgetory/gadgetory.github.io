unboxing on the antic cooler h2o 920 so
this is a thicker style radiator with
push-pull fans as well as a low profile
CPU block slash pump unit so let's see
what Antec has to say for themselves
they're saying its next generation
maximum performance okay you have PWM
control zero maintenance as well as a
quick installation system it is
compatible with 775 1155 1156 1366 a.m.
2 a.m. 3 M 2 plus M 3 plus so pretty
much every socket Under the Sun these
days
here we go fan speed here's all of your
general specs which are naturally
covered by a sticker thanks for that
let's go in I draw move that there there
we go alright so now we can see the
specs so there's your fan speed from 700
to 2400 rpm radiator dimensions so the
thickness of this rad is 49 millimeters
that's the important one fans these are
your standard 120 by 25 mil fans
coldplay high tubing length okay none of
this is probably gonna be that relevant
that weight this is an interesting one
so it's 1.6 pounds and the great thing
about these self-contained liquid
cooling units is that if you ever have
to ship or move your system around most
of that weight is strapped to the case
unlike a heat sink where all the weight
is going to be hanging off the CPU
socket so there's a customizable RGB LED
on the CPU block itself so you can
actually change the color that that's
pretty cool through the software PWM
radiator fans okay included software
provides essential tools to control and
monitor the cooler h2o including coolant
temperatures okay that's pretty neat and
non corrugated easy Bend tubes so that's
something that we have not seen before
on these pre done liquid cooling setup
so I'll definitely be commenting on what
kind of
they're using and what I think of it
I've been water cooling for almost seven
years so I do have a fair bit of
experience with tubing blocks all right
here's the insides actually one more
thing on the outside of the box so the
lower CPU temperatures are better okay
thanks for stating the obvious mr. Graff
CPU core temp so here's the intel air
cooler here's a first generation liquid
cooler so they're saying it's around 70
degrees and they're saying the cooler
h2o is more like a 60 degrees and that's
on an i7 980 X at a hundred percent load
so I'm not sure exactly which first
generation cooler they're comparing to
but presumably it's one of the slightly
thinner ones such as Mesa Tech LC LC
here we have an installation guide
although I should be able to figure out
how this mounts relatively easily we
have a chill control V version 1.0
software thing so you can probably
download that from the antec website we
have mounting hardware so this is pretty
straightforward we've seen this before
hey this is neat so Corsair had a
similar system with the H 50 and the H
70 but you can see now instead of it
just the plastic bits just all being
black they're color coded green for AMD
blue for Intel so that is a nice touch
and then we've got hold downs for AMD as
well as hold downs for Intel and then
all of the little heart of our bit stuff
you need all right let's take out the
radiator CPU block and pump and let's go
ahead and take out the fans one of my
biggest complaints about the of course
our fans was that they just didn't seem
very well built they're kind of flimsy
and they're pretty loud so these look a
little bit better constructed I mean
antics been making fans for about three
million years so I'm sure they've got
fans figured out overall the frame feels
quite good it's more like inline with
the cool it fans that they were using on
the on the eco as well as the advantage
so here you go another fan looks just
like that lots of blades probably
optimized for static pressure and the
reason for that would be
this so you can see it's quite a dense
fin arrangement here so that means that
rather than optimizing the fan for CFM
that is straight airflow in an
unrestricted environment you want to
optimize a fan for static pressure so
that is in a restricted environment how
much air can it force through said
restricted environment so here you can
see how thick the radiator is and here
why don't we do why don't we do the
classic iPhone in comparison oh I think
I just showed crazy Russian oh well well
good he's not really that much of a
secret anyway you can find pictures of
him on the NZXT Facebook and I'm a bit
much of a crazy either okay all right
okay and tech 920 oh okay here's a hint
as to who the OEM might be for this it's
right on there can you get that yeah yes
no yes okay all right so here are the
easy flex tubes or whatever it is
they're calling them and actually these
are nice look at that so these are using
very thick thick walled tubing so this
is still one quarter inch tubing but
just uses an incredibly thick wall so
that gives you this crazy denned radius
where you could basically take it and
bend it like this and like that and all
in a circle and it's still not going to
collapse so this is outstanding actually
that is definitely a benefit of using
the cooler 920 so here is the pump and
sorry just give it there we go
here's the pump and block combo unit so
that's where the custom RGB lighting is
going to come from and there's the
cooler branding these are rotatable so
you can actually position it quite
easily according to which way the tubing
is coming in so that you don't have
undue stress on the tubing or on the
fittings all right here on the bottom
you can see the copper base as well as
the pre applied thermal compound that is
a high quality thermal compound so I
wouldn't feel the need to replace it
unless you are taking it off and you
need to reapply thermal compound to your
CPU so you've got a bunch of cables
coming off this guy all black thankfully
that is
that is excellent because the CPU socket
can get very cluttered very quickly if
you have a bunch of brightly colored
cables around it but we've got one USB
so that's going to be for the monitoring
software we have and that's a USB header
so that will plug directly into your
motherboard and then we have hmm
Oh neat okay so the whole unit gets
powered off of a single three pin so
what you're able to do oh this is great
so check this out okay guys so here's
how this works
your fans use their four pin pwm plugs
to plug into this splitter right here
okay the PWM control is all done at the
controller level within the CPU block so
what that means is that the Antec
software does all of that control
without any intervention from the
motherboard and that really provides a
way for an tech to control the end-user
experience much better because a lot of
motherboards have control schemes that
are drastically different from different
from each other so this way antec can
accurately report the noise level of the
system as well as the temperatures from
one simple interface via USB so this guy
provides power to the whole deal now I
probably wouldn't recommend plugging
this into your CPU fan header on your
motherboard I'm not sure what ntek has
to say about that in the instructions
but three fans and the pump seems to me
like it might be a little much maybe I'm
mistaken though maybe they're going to
say that you should plug it into the CPU
fan header yes they do okay they say the
CPU fan header is perfectly capable of
handling if remember USB is going to be
providing power to some parts of some
aspects of this as well so maybe they've
got some kind of distribution system
where it's not gonna affect things
negatively but there you go so thank you
