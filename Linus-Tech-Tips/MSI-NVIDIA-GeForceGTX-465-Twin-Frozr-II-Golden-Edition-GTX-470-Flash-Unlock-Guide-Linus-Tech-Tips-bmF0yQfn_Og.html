golden edition gtx 465 in the comments
that many of these could be unlocked -
gtx 470 so my curiosity was naturally
piqued one of the reasons that most GTX
460 5s can't be unlocked two gtx 470 is
that the gtx 465 does not have the same
number of ram chips as the gtx 470 even
though it does use a 470 reference PCB
but what i found out by removing the 10
or so screws from the back of the Twin
Frozr 2 limited edition cooler here is
that this gtx 465 does have 10 ram chips
instead of being missing - like a normal
465 so the next thing i'm going to be
doing is putting the cooler back on it
and seeing if i can actually unlock full
gtx 470 performance from the gtx 465 and
i should put that in quotes because it
does have 10 ram chips golden edition
limited edition video card i put the
card back together and did a quick
Vantage run at just stopped clocks stock
voltage just to see sort of where we
land and I'm going to try following the
unlocking procedure which I will show
you in a couple minutes to see if we can
unlock gtx 470 performance from the Twin
Frozr golden edition alright well the
first step in our slightly unusual video
card BIOS flashing procedure it's
unusual because we're going to have to
force the BIOS flashing utility to
overwrite some parts of the cards
firmware that you normally wouldn't even
when you're updating a BIOS so because
we want to change it from being a 465 to
a 470 and we're going to overwrite with
a 470 BIOS so we have to do things a
little bit differently so the first step
is to use this command and the flash - -
erase EEPROM and then we press Y to
confirm
now it is very very important you do not
reboot your computer at this time
because you have erased do you basically
just erased without replacing firmware
from the card so the next step is going
to be NV flash and we are going to put
in some additional commands here and
then let me just double check what I've
gone and named the file so I'll just
leave this camera here for you to look
at and apparently it is mashing the
spacebar which is a bad thing now okay
there we go
okay seventy rom so this is the part
where we're actually going to flash the
GTX 470 firmware onto our 465 so PCI
device ID override detected yes
we do want to do this so we're going to
type es in all caps overriding GPU
mismatch yes we want to do that as well
and overriding the board ID is only
needed yet we are we are overriding the
board ID because we want a 470 now bear
in mind unless you check that it has ten
RAM chips and even then this won't
always work I take no responsibility for
you breaking your card because that can
happen in fact it's quite possible that
I have bricked this one so we're going
to go ahead and remove my flash drive
and reboot and find out if we're going
to make it back into Windows I hope we
do maybe I'll let you stay along for the
ride okay first step is going to be
getting it to post it posts that's good
it has to get a lot further than that
though so in theory this is a GTX 470
now so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to run some Vantage benchmarks on it and
see if the score actually improves now
by unlocking it to a 470 not only do we
actually get to use those additional two
chips of ram so instead of being a 1 gig
card this is now I believe it's a shoot
1280 or something like that so 1.2
something gig card so there's that and
we also unlit unlock some additional
memory bandwidth and as well as a couple
of other functional units on the GPU
itself so we should get quite a
significant performance boost out of
this and for nothing for no additional
cost so yeah this is a very interesting
thing that MSI has gone and done by
producing a gtx 465 that is basically
just a 470 it's a wolf in sheep's
clothing mind you it's not really
sheep's clothing when you go and put
like that beefy crazy all copper cooler
on it ok so we're into Windows so the
graphics card sort of sort of works I
might actually need to reboot here in
order to get it to be detected properly
so maybe just bear with me oh no there
it is ok NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 so I'll
be back in a minute and I'll show you
the full result that it looks like it
worked well let there be no doubt this
is a GTX 470 now you can see gpu-z
brings up all of the information here so
it is now a 1.2 8 gig card rather than a
1 gig card it has a 320 bit bus width
rather than a 256 bit bus width and it
also has let me see yeah it has an ID
that says GTX 470 I ran Vantage again we
score 17,000 886 marks so that is a very
very significant boost over the 14,000
and change we scored before there it is
confirmed it takes about 2 minutes to do
the flashing process as you saw and
you get a wack little more performance
so this card actually looks like a
tremendous value thanks for checking out
