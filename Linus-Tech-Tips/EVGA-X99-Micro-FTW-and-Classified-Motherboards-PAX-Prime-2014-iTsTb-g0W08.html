to you by HyperX gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device hi guys
we here the EVGA booth with and pretty
interesting motherboard this is their
x99 micro which we may or may not have
it the office already I'm not sure what
type of things are covering that so I'm
gonna say may or may not this board is
fairly interesting they have a nice
little cover over there IO
which is comprised of six USB 2.0 ports
a clear CMOS button in between the USB
2.0 ports and four USB 3.0 Ethernet and
audio jacks I'm actually happy that
there's a whole bunch of USB 2.0 and I
know a few people are gonna look at me
kind of weird for that but it's really
nice because compatibility for you USB
3.0 honestly isn't that great so when
I'm setting up a computer
I like having at least three because
then I have USB like it's generally used
to be stick keyboard and mouse at the
very least so it's actually nice to see
quite a few of those look at the board
itself we have a CPU power at the top
two fans a clear CMOS button power reset
some sort of I'm assuming both this
check out point a post LED power for the
motherboard as a whole six SATA ports
USB 2.0 front panel connectors USB 3.0
you know the chassis fan another chassis
fan spit it out and your audio in right
there four lanes we've got a PCIe x16
slot and I believe in x8 and another x16
that's 1616 8 sorry for that we have an
m2 socket right kind of in between your
16 and you're 16 right in there in the
middle and then you have four Ram slots
in total for this board it's really
interesting because it's a micro board
this socket is freakin huge if you
haven't noticed that yet so it's pretty
cool that they were actually able to fit
on a micro board I know I was just
talking to them they said they wanted to
fit on an ITX board so they can fit it
in one of their cases but as of right
now maybe not so much because of how
freaking massive that socket actually is
alright guys now we're moving on to the
x99 for the win jumping into i/o for
this one again a nice little metal cover
which will make it look really sweet
it's not super different from the past
another six USB 2.0 ports another clear
CMOS button dual ethernet four USB 3.0
and then your standard audio jack so
that's actually pretty much the same
jumping up at the top we have another
fan header on the left hand side we have
your CPU power another fan header
another fan header
power reset buttons I believe it's both
a check point like I said before and
then you have a right-angled normal
24-pin power for your motherboard which
it's really cool that that's right
angled not all cases but a lot of cases
we will take really really good
advantage of that so I'm happy to see
that a right angled fan port again super
cool a whole ton of SATA ports 2 4 6 8
10 SATA ports which is impressive
another fan slot under that your front
IO ports your friend IO header sorry USB
3.0 USB 2.0 another right angle fan
header that an onboard speaker which
actually the smaller one had as well
which is pretty cool
another right angle fan header so you
can plug not only a crap-ton of fans
into this thing but a lot of them are
gonna be right angle and then you have
power for your expansion card lanes
which is cool to see if you're gonna be
running a massive amount of graphics
cards but none of you to do that but
it's still pretty cool so it's not
required to plug that in just so you
guys know and then you also have your
spit if out and audio jacks right there
this one instead of having four Ram
slots actually has eight Ram slots and
then yet again it just has that massive
massive socket alright guys now this is
the x99 classified I'm mainly just gonna
be covering differences the i/o is the
same this plate shield here is the same
two amount of RAM slots but one thing
that they told me about is that there is
more gold content in the actual socket
than in their other two boards which is
pretty interesting I'm not gonna be able
to test anything like that or anything
all the board's because this is just
kind of a visual overview as we don't
actually have this in the office maybe
we'll give this in the office later be
able to talk about the finer details
later on other than that it's pretty
similar except that there are 2 m2
sockets we have an extended m2 socket
down here
and then we have this is a key and the
socket and then we have a key socket
here for another m2 are just not quite
as long there's dual CPU power instead
of single dpu CPU power like on the
previous one you still the right angle
24 pin same amount of st. us all that
kind of stuff one thing that I didn't
talk about on the previous board was its
lanes so you've got a 16 X + 8 X another
8 X a 16 X of 4x and another 8 X that is
a crap-ton of lanes but kind of actually
what I was expecting from this board so
that's pretty cool to see alright guys
