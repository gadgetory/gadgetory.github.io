the Corsair H 110 this is a 280
millimeter liquid cooler from Corsair it
is an all-in-one prefilled liquid cooler
which means it's pretty much zero
maintenance within its reasonably
expected lifespan of how long you would
have that computer and it is simple to
install as long as you pick out a case
that it is compatible with as we open up
the box we find everything packed in a
neat eco-friendly package so this is
using sort of brown paper cardboard
rather than going heavy on the foam even
things like the radiator itself are not
packed in foam it's just a paper
recyclable material which I do like to
see also you have a warranty card that
tells you not a whole lot but it's ok
because on the duration of warranty well
it depends anywhere from two years for
lifetime it's okay though because it
tells you right on the outside of the
box that it is a five-year guarantee
from Corsair inside the box we find a
number of things including two 140
millimeter fans it should be noted that
unlike the Corsair 100 I these are not
Corsair design fans I mean they're
Corsair fans but they don't have the
flat blades like the SP series so
they're using more of what we saw on
Corsairs last generation liquid coolers
in terms of the blade design okay they
are four pin pwm fans however and they
do have black ribbon cables so they're
going to go well with your system pretty
much no matter what I mean Corsair is is
so good at making sure that their
components are not only high performance
but also are held to a different
standard in terms of aesthetics for
mounting hardware you've got everything
you need for pretty much every socket
you could possibly need including FM one
FM 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 3 + a.m. 2 a.m. 2 + LGA
1156 LGA 1155 LGA 775 LGA 1366 and LGA
2011 the instructions that are included
are very straightforward and again we're
used to seeing this and if you've
installed something like a Corsair H 70
or H 50 in the past you'll pretty much
already know how to use all this stuff
one of the challenging things with the
Corsair 100 a or rather H 110 is
case compatibility so there are some
coarser cases compatible with this
particular cooler I mean even some of
the cases that they don't say are
compatible actually ended up working for
example we found that we could install
it in a vengence c70 which is right over
there and that is not listed as
compatible we did this without any
cutting all we had to do was get some
washers and put them between the screws
and the case itself because the holes
were a little bit wide so that was the
only issue so with a little bit of
ingenuity if you've got a dual 140
millimeter fan mount on the top and
enough clearance to have not only the
radiator but also the fan itself without
interfering with any of the components
of your motherboard you shouldn't run
into too much difficulty the radiator
itself is as you'd expect about 36
percent larger than in H 100 I or an H
100 due to the larger fan design it is
still a fairly slim radiator so this is
necessary because the last thing you
want to do with a product like this it's
not compatible with every case out there
is go and make it thicker so that it's
compatible with even fewer cases because
it's so wide you're not going to be able
to do what some case manufacturers have
done and that is to offset the 120
millimeter mounting holes in the top so
that there's room for the motherboard on
the side rather than centering it with
something this large the tubing is a
very very flexible quarter inch tubing
so that's another option that hasn't
been carried over from the H 100 I in
addition to Corsair link software not
being included with the H 110 at this
time so the H 100 I has 3/8 tubing
whereas the H 1 hunt when these are very
confusing model names h 110 does not
have 3/8 inch tubing it has 1/4 inch
tubing it also lacks here we go
rather known doesn't lack it oh yeah it
also lacks lighting effects on the block
itself but it does have the same
swiveling connectors here so that you're
not going to have any difficulty
regardless of where your CPU socket is
situated on your motherboard making sure
that the tubing is not sort of at a
weird angle that puts unnecessary strain
on the connectors the design for
mounting is the traditional sort of ring
mounting bracket that we've seen many
times in the past with a copper base
that has a high quality thermal compound
pre applied to it
and the pump here we go is powered by a
black ribbon cable that is a three pin
connector so that will plug into either
a PWM CPU fan connector or a legacy
three pin connector but you'll only be
able to use DC control if you wanted to
lower the speed of the pump but I really
really wouldn't recommend doing that in
95 cases out of actually 100 cases I've
hundred just don't do that thank you for
