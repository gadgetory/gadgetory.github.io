guys this is the geforce gtx 680 from
galaxy this is the new flagship single
GPU graphics card from nvidia by our
friends at galaxy this is a 2 gigabyte
frame buffer over 1 gigahertz core clock
and over 6 gigahertz memory clock
graphics card it has 2 6 pin power
connectors it has a PCI Express 3.0 16x
slot is compatible with the variety of
SLI configurations that are available
using these 2 SLI ports and it is on the
latest manufacturing process enabling it
to be phenomenally power efficient and
my camera won't focus and perform like
the bee's knees and supposedly although
I have not yet tested this card it also
over clocks like like whoa like pretty
good so in terms of cards that I'm going
to be testing against I have a total of
seven cards to be tested so I've got
these 7970 from AMD this is a stock bone
reference card to be compared against
the reference gtx 680 I have a sapphire
HD 7950 so this is an aftermarket card
you're going to see this one strengths
when we get to things like the acoustics
and temperature testing that's going to
be a separate video though this is the
performance video we've got the GTX 590
this is a last generation dual GPU card
to compare against the current
generation single GPU card 6990 so this
is a last generation dual GPU card from
AMD then I want to compare the 680
against the 580 as well as the previous
generation gtx 570 so that we can see
where it falls in terms of the overall
performance stack now you see 3d vision
glasses there that's going to be a
separate review this is going to be my
2d performance at 1080p review since
that is what the majority of monitors
are supporting these days that is what
we are going to be focused on how now I
did change a couple things so instead of
using my normal benchmarking settings
for the games that I ran
I did alter things a little bit so for
battlefield 3 I'm using the ultra preset
for Crysis 2 I'm using Ultra Plus
high-res textures which or two is ultra
plus the vsync is off dirt 3 is 4 times
anti-aliasing with high and ultra where
available Batman Arkham City is going to
be using four times multi sample
anti-aliasing this is important which
kind of anti-aliasing I'm using because
this new card supports a couple of modes
of anti aliasing that have some distinct
advantage TxAA and FXAA
but we are not going to be using those
for the purposes of this review this
will be apples to apples PhysX off ok
and Skyrim will be at Ultra with four
times MS AAA x AF vsync forced off
through the ini file and the high res
texture pack the official high res
texture pack you can see I've actually
finished the benchmarks for all the
other cards this takes forever guys it
takes absolutely forever and you can
also see a sneak peak of all the
different scenarios I'm planning to run
1080p review I yes my test bench so this
is my LGA 2011 test bench with a 36 30 K
3030 3930k 3930k this is running at
stock speed so I haven't made any
changes to that guy right there 16 gigs
of Kingston HyperX memory and Asus p9
x79 deluxe motherboard as well as a
corsair h 100 for my boot SSD I'm using
a muskan Chronos deluxe my steam drive
is running off here and for my power
supply using an OC z ZX series 12 50
watt modular power supply that pretty
much covers it for the test bench itself
and it is time to start testing this
card because yes that is the line that
is still blank has not yet been on the
test bench I'll be using the latest
drivers on all cards so that is 12.2 for
the AMD cards and then the home on which
one is this I'll have to look because
it's going to be a different driver for
the new card than it is for the other
card so 296 point 10 for every GeForce
card except the 680 which will be using
the 300 point whatever it is sorry for
the long intro guys here we go
here's Rumble investigating my test
bench while the GTX 680 runs 3dmark 11
my first test of the night from Bratz he
is
Oh stepping on a 6990 get off there
go on get get
here we are in the middle of a combined
test so to give you guys some idea how
power efficiency sky is check this out
it's pulling less than 280 watts from
the wall so that's probably around 250
watts of actual power consumption with
the six core processor high-end single
graphics card and throughout all of this
thing is darn near silent as well but
more on that later
a score of 31 72 puts it right in line
with the rest of our whip 5 the GTX 590
in 3d mark 11 although significantly
behind the 6990 let's see how things go
in real world gameplay scenarios so as I
always do I'm using oh I guess I
shouldn't say always because dirt3 is
using a canned benchmark in Batman
Arkham City is using a canned benchmark
battlefield 3 is using my usual
run-through of the comrades beginning of
the comrades level Crysis 2 is using my
usual run-through of the first camp in
Crysis 2 The Witcher 2 is using a
run-through where I go up a little hill
I fight some guys go through a building
and then come into a courtyard where I
fight some other guys and Skyrim the
town is called white white run I think
something like that and I do a couple
laps of white run looking at some people
looking at some fire looking around so
stay tuned for real-world gaming
benchmarks and the first results are in
so while posting power results that are
very similar to the incredibly powerful
79-78 posts also better average
framerate and the same minimum frame
rate compared to the 7970 it actually
performs similarly to the GTX 590 once
again while consuming over a hundred and
fifty watts less power at the wall
something to note here is due to the
very high graphical settings both the
580 and the 570 kind of choked on this
benchmark so you can see there is an
enormous difference between this new
generation premium card and the last
generation 1 now Crysis 2 is less of a
clear win against the lower price 7970
but it is still a win nonetheless so it
takes the performance crown again in
Crysis 2 something that I've known
at this point is that this is actually
the first reference geforce card that
i've encountered that does have coil
whines so it's a little bit of a
high-pitched noise that you experience
under load with the card and i'm talking
about in games not in folding at home or
anything like that this is something
that i've experienced on pretty much
every reference AMD card for the last
few generations but hadn't seen on a
geforce card as yet so the 680 does does
exhibit this noise exhibited um make it
the witcher 2 looks like a tight battle
between the 7970 in terms of average FPS
and the gtx 680 but in actuality you can
see my notes here from when i was
testing this 30fps which is considered
sort of the minimum of playable was very
unpayable felt very laggy whereas this
30 f/32 FPS actually felt significantly
better so so yeah that puts the gtx 680
as far as a single card solutions go
definitely at the top this is another
title where the last generation products
from nvidia the 580 and the 570 really
struggled
whether that's due to having less video
memory remember the new card has two
gigs versus 1.5 and 1.28 on those older
cards and also has significantly more
power but uses a similar amount of power
since I haven't shown you guys my Skyrim
test sequence before I'll take this
opportunity to do that so I'm just
running around this town following the
same path every time looking off into
the distance a little bit I always stop
and look down at this camp for a couple
seconds running very smoothly although I
did see a flicker there yeah there's
another one so I've experienced
flickering now on the 6990 7970 and and
this card out of all the cards that were
tested I've seen this flickering on
three of them
so that's very frustrating definitely
detracts from gameplay now I could
probably get the flickering to go away
by changing some graphical settings on
any of those given cards but since what
I'm trying to do is find a similarly
demanding situation for each of the
cards I don't really want to
change any settings and I stop and look
at this guard for a second stop and look
at this guard first I can get my cat to
go away and then off we go around again
so while I'm doing the second lap I'll
talk about some other things so first of
all is my power testing methodology I
don't know if you guys can see it
through the camera yeah you can you can
see my power meter so what I'm doing is
well in benchmarking I'm keeping an eye
on that and what I'm looking for is sort
of something along the lines of a
consistent peak so if I see it spiked to
320 once but then you know otherwise
hover more around the when it's when
it's under high load around the 300 watt
range 305 watt range then that's where
I'll take the reading for that card yeah
it's very approximate let's see this one
I'd probably go with 305 based on what
I've seen so far that's something that
that's a peak that I've hit several
times so you can see skyrim isn't
running a hundred percent correctly on
this card maybe that's in part due to
the early drivers could be settings I
also want oh yeah so yeah power and
temperatures instead of measuring power
and temps with like a synthetic
benchmark what I'm doing is I'm looking
at it in all of the applications that
I'm testing in order to get a good solid
average so this benchmarks done you can
tell because the fraps killer has
reappeared so I'll definitely have to
make some notes about the flickering on
this one and let's go have a look at the
results temperature monitoring is done
using msi afterburner so I'm looking for
the peak temperature which looks like it
was 77 here which is consistent with all
the other ones this kind of stands to
reason because what the gtx 680 does is
it actually uses its thermal thermal
envelope to determine how much power to
throw at a particular game so it'll
actually scale its clock speed let me
see if if afterburner is correctly I
look at that it is monitoring core clock
whoops oh no I don't think it's
monitoring that correctly well let's not
worry about that for now then I know
that EVGA precision is already updated
for the GTX 680 but none of the other
applications are right now so 680 comes
right oh hold on maybe there was another
card yeah flickering on the 590 the 6990
and the 79 70
looks like all of the all the king
performers flickering um had the same
issue with this game so there there you
have it so it's the 685 95 85 70 69 .
90-79 70 and 79 50 so this is in terms
of sheer performance a clear win for the
GTX 680 where it actually beats out
everything in this test by a slim margin
including the GTX 590 it definitely felt
significantly smoother during use and
once again that impressive power
consumption is right there and we're
done here Batman Arkham City which
ironically is the way it's meant to be
played title is the first game we've
seen where the GTX 680 is actually
outperformed by the Radeon HD 7970 could
be driver issues because one thing I
noticed here is that the power
consumption of the card was
significantly lower than it was in the
other games so what that means to me is
maybe the GPU core clock isn't scaling
in order to to reach its maximum TDP or
maybe there's some driver optimizations
they can squeeze some more performance
out of this game I guess we will have to
wait and see so just a reminder this is
the 680 the 590 the 580 the 570 this
6990 the 7970 and the 79 50 which is
almost equal with the GTX 680 in this
particular title so that pretty much
concludes my performance benchmarks so
here we go I'm just gonna freeze frame
for you guys yeah I could make graphs
but I really don't think that's likely
to happen Oh idle power so idle power
all of these new generation cards the
680 as well as the 79 70 in the 79 50
are significant improvements over their
last generation brethren in terms of
idle power idle temperatures remain for
the most part fairly similar though so
let's go ahead and start hiding row so
in review
there's the cards and battlefield 3 as
including the power and temperatures of
all of these games and we can go ahead
and hide those ones
there's Crysis 2 including power
temperature min Max and
average numbers The Witcher 2 so there
is our power temps min max average
remember guys this was completely
unplayable whether that's a driver issue
or whatever else this 30 was not
playable unlike the 32 here next we've
got dirt three
Batman Arkham City which was a Radeon
dominated test this time around well
other than the 590 but whatever guys
alright and finally Skyrim which had
weird flickering on these four cards and
was otherwise fairly normal so thank you
for checking out my performance review
of the geforce gtx 680 and a single card
configuration at 1080p with high /
ultimate or ultra graphic settings on a
variety of games don't forget to
