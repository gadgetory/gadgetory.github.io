really really small
well first you might try a measuring
tape then calipers and if you've got a
big budget you might treat yourself to a
scanning electron microscope but there
is one very clear problem with all of
those solutions a they're too small and
B they don't use lasers at Lago they had
the right idea
so by shooting a laser for kilometres
down this tube they're able to get an
accuracy of one ten thousandth the
charge diameter of proton that's like
measuring from here to the closest star
with the accuracy of a hair which I
don't know I still don't have context
for that but it got them the Nobel Prize
for Physics and they were the first ones
to get gravitational waves detected so
awesome glass wire lets you instantly
see your current and past network
activity you can detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC and
Android device and you can use offer
code Lynas to get 25% off glass wire at
the link below
gravitational waves happen all the time
every time the mass accelerates waves
ripple through space-time so like I'm
actually waving space-time right now but
it only really becomes noticeable when
crazy massive things start accelerating
like black holes colliding when Einstein
first predicted gravitational waves in
1916 he thought they were a problem with
his algebra and then later when he
believed that they were real he figured
it would still be impossible to detect
them but of course that hasn't stopped
people from trying in the 50s Josef
Weber first tried to detect
gravitational waves using the 6000 pound
chunk of aluminum the idea is that it
would resonate when gravitational waves
went through it and that we picked up by
these piezoelectric crystals on the top
unfortunately it just wasn't possible to
get the precision needed in 1972 though
ray vise wrote a paper detailing just
how an interferometer could be used to
detect gravitational waves basically he
wrote a laser beam could go through a
beam splitter and then down to four
kilometer long tubes at the end of each
of these tubes would be a mirror that
sends the beam back where it would be
recombined by the beam splitter and then
measured
normally when recombined in this manner
the two beams would destructively
interfere but if a gravitational wave
were to pass through the detector it
should physically distort space and time
causing the length of the two arms to
vary slightly change compared to each
other this would change the interference
of the two beams ultimately changing the
signal on the photo detector at the end
in 2002 then Caltech and MIT joined
forces to create I'll ago a proof that
this could work and after extensive
research and an upgrade to advanced LIGO
we were able to successfully detect
gravitational waves in 2015 and by we of
course I mean humans as a species not me
I wasn't involved so behind us is the
beam splitter so
it comes from the laser room back there
which is why we have to have these laser
glasses on get split rate around here
and then get sent off the arms that way
in that way it then travels back in and
is detected over there somewhere
unsurprisingly taking measurements that
precisely in the real world
is a lot easier said than done any
particles in the air will cause the
laser to scatter and although they're
only sending in 20 watts of laser power
the way it works is to have the beam
trapped as a standing wave inside so
after 300 bounces or so that amplifies
it to about a hundred kilowatts with
power like that even a tiny speck of
dust on the mirror could absorb enough
heat to permanently damage it meaning
that the four kilometer tubes or arms
have to be under an ultra high vacuum so
this is the concrete that goes around
the arm
it doesn't actually help with the laser
- but it's just a protective from like
cars animals stray bullets or whatever
the real magic though happens in this
three millimeter thick stainless steel
tube which is hold two one trillionth of
an ATM even the vacuum outside the
International Space Station can't hold a
candle to what they've got going on in
here so how did they build it
well first they cooked or more
accurately baked now if regular
stainless steel was used for this
hydrogen and other particles on the
metal could contaminate the vacuum so to
combat this every inside surface needs
to be heated to at least 170 degrees
Celsius and held there for an extended
amount of time now for the nuts and
bolts that's pretty simple I mean I
could do that with my toaster oven at
home but for something this large what
they had to do was pump a quadrant of it
full of electricity effectively using
the resistance of the metal to turn it
into a heater and hold it at a hundred
and seventy for a month with the vacuum
pumps running to remove all the
contaminants I guess that's probably why
they wouldn't let us inside we are the
contaminants so
cool now the laser can make its way from
one end to the other but what about the
mirrors on the end even something as
small as a truck on the highway or an
earthquake in Taiwan would create too
much vibration for gravitational wave
detection which I guess is probably why
they put their air-conditioner way off
away from the building rather than up on
top of it like normal people this is one
of the mirrors from I'll ago to reduce
the high frequency vibrations the mirror
is hung like a pendulum by this steel
wire and the lower frequency vibrations
are decreased by the springs on the
lower base but they obviously weren't
done there in the newer version the
mirror is hung from four pendulums by
glass fibers and that is far from the
end on the bottom of the table there's
actually a seismometer that measures any
movement in the ground and then uses
that information to manipulate voice
coils and static electricity to actively
cancel out the vibrations coming from
the ground at this point then the
mirrors are basically perfectly still
but they still aren't done yet for some
frequencies their level of accuracy is
being determined by quantum mechanics in
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle but
even this can be reduced using quantum
squeezing on a very basic level they can
only know so much about the amplitude or
phase of the laser light but for this
application the amplitude of the light
being detected matters a lot less so
they're able to perform a quantum
squeeze and get better accuracy out of
the phase detection so they're using a
KTP crystal that is a potassium titanal
phosphate crystal and this is able to
transform one green photon into two
infrared photons or vice-versa energy is
conserved here because the infrared
light has less energy than the green
light so what they do here is pump a
crystal full of infrared light this is
just to get a lot of green light and
high-powered infrared lasers are easier
to get and then that green light is sent
into another KTP crystal but when those
photons are emitted they
our quantumly entangled now in a vacuum
there naturally exists a lot of noise
particularly when there is a very little
light like around the dark end of the
detector so by injecting these entangled
photons they're able to remove the
completely random vacuum noise and
replace it with the entangled photons
that produce noise that they like now
you're probably thinking I am - holy
sweet crap how could they even verify
that these are actually gravitational
waves they're detecting and the answer
is by building another detector on the
other side of the country so that if a
gravitational wave is detected they can
confirm that it isn't just a localized
movement oh and also by using two
observatories to try and find where the
astronomical event is happening so with
the accuracy of the interferometer
mostly figured out how the heck do they
acquire all the data and process it ah
yes my friends we are finally getting to
the computery part of the video in here
they collect data from two hundred and
fifty thousand channels simultaneously
and then to isolate the signals being
created by the detector from the
computers they actually put the noisy
bits of the computer CPUs power etc in
another room a hundred and fifty feet
down the hall and they connect them
using fiber-optic PCI Express extenders
the most important thing with the
computing here though is timing so every
processors clock in this server room is
synced using a custom-built system since
the processors timing has to be
precisely known in order to calculate
the time of events in the interferometer
but it's not just synced in this room
there are also computers at the very
ends of the laser arms for kilometres
away with their clocks perfectly
synchronized - and the 22 microsecond
transmission time delay taken into
account
oh and that second gravitational wave
Observatory in Louisiana you guessed
right the processor clocks are perfectly
synchronized they're too
once the data is collected it gets sent
over to their server warehouse for
analysis and very quick analysis is
important since if there's a large
astronomical event taking place they'll
detect it here first and then they need
to be able to tell their astronomers
where to point the telescopes in a
timely manner
so all that processing is handled in
here where they've got 6,000 processing
course 64 GPUs almost 4 terabytes of RAM
and close to five and a half petabytes
of data stored on SSD spinning and tape
storage the data is then copied from
here to Caltech servers where it is
further analyzed and made available to
more scientists and then eventually the
armchair physicists at home and they're
still not done future plans to improve
their accuracy involve using cryogenics
to reduce the movement of the molecules
on the mirrors detecting changes in the
Earth's gravity to remove noise from
movement below the earth's crust
implementing quantum squeeze that can be
changed throughout the frequency band
and even building a space-based
gravitational wave Observatory the goal
is that with every little adjustment
they should be able to see even further
into space collecting a bit more data
about how our universe works so a huge
thanks to LIGO and particularly amber
Iraq for letting us come and hang out in
the observatory and a huge thanks to you
