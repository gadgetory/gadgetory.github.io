China to check out their new surface pro
not the surface pro 5 just the surface
Pro which is totally different from the
surface pro that was released in 2013
and also totally different from the
surface pro 4 this is the new surface
pro line of said after not exactly being
too enthusiastic with surface pro 1
through 3 that version 4 was where he
thought the concept finally lined up
with Microsoft's vision so now it's time
to see how far they take it from there
we're hosting LTX 2017 on July 29th 2017
it's a meet-up tech carnival thing and
it's going to be a lot of fun
learn more at the link in the video
description first let's start with specs
under the hood you can pick your
processor you can go from the Intel m3
to a core i5 Tuvan a core i7 for RIM you
can range yourself from 4 gigs to 16
gigs and for storage you can go with
solid state drives from 128 gigs to one
terabyte with the one terabyte option
being in the nvme ultra fast variety but
depending on your flavor of choice
you'll be shelling out anywhere from 800
US dollars to 2,700 you're paying for
that performance an nvme Drive I would
say that my sweet spot would probably be
the core i5 with 8 gigs of ram and a 256
gig SSD but if you do want those iris
pro graphics for doing more graphical
stuff or even some minor gaming you
might want to upgrade that being said
the m3 and i-5 models don't have a fan
they're all cooled so well that they are
fanless operation which is pretty sweet
if you want a silent computer they claim
that the event that the performance of
the laptop went up by 20% over its
previous version that seems a little
intense
considering the processor upgrade that
they had so we'll have to investigate
this claim more back at the office
but one thing that they did state that
was super cool is that there's 4.5 hours
more battery life over top of the
surface pro 4 which brings you to 13.5
hours of video playback battery it's
also rocking a beautiful 12 point three
inch pixel sense display with an aspect
ratio of 3 by 2 and a pixel per inch
count of 267 it looks awesome and that's
pretty much all I have to say there the
pen has also received welcome
improvements going from ten twenty four
degrees of pressure sensitivity in the
old version way up to 4096 on the new
one the actuation force needed to make a
line has moved down from 21 grams to
just 10 grams
it supports tilt for shading which is
super cool and it is apparently the
fastest digital pen on the planet with
only 21 milliseconds of latency but it
along with the keyboard are
not included in the box the surface pen
a rather iconic part of the surface pro
laptop is now sold separately if you
have the previous version of the pen it
is forwards compatible and the new pen
is also backwards compatible if you
don't want to buy a whole new laptop but
do want a better pen which is cool but
that's going to add a lot of cost if you
want a pen in a keyboard with your
laptop and to continue the not-so-great
news we've got the i/o on the left-hand
side you've got a headset jack on the
bottom you have the cover ports on the
right-hand side you've got a mini
display port a surface connect port and
a full size USB 3 port along with a
micro SD port on the bottom the lack of
Thunderbolt 3 or if I dare say USB C
feels a little dated at this point and
considering Linus already criticized the
surface pro 4 for lacking these things
along with just not having a full size
SD slot it just feels kind of weird that
the i/o was entirely overlooked with
this revision if you're unsatisfied with
those io options you can use the dock
but as you may have guessed it is sold
separately as well and last but possibly
not least depending on your use case
they have decided to include LTE
capability which is pretty damn cool if
you really want to embrace the whole
portability of your device with those
13.5 hours of video playback battery
life in conclusion 2 or so months ago
Linus looked at the surface pro 4 and
deemed it at the very least worthy of
consideration depending on your use case
now it's received an upgrade and its
pricing structure seems to have stayed
pretty much the same which makes it an
even better option
it feels great in your hand the build
quality seems rather wonderful as long
as you've never ever have to take it
apart but I do really really wish they
took another look at their i/o and
modernized it a little bit as it stands
the surface pro is a very interesting
laptop but it kind of feels like a game
that really needs is VLC to be fully
featured and fully complete you don't
have the keyboard with it if you're
buying this you probably want it for
some type of design work and it
doesn't come with the pen if you're
buying this you might need to plug more
than you know kind of one thing into it
at a time so you might need the doc
you're going to walk into the store with
quite a few things maybe our wishes will
come through for the next version of the
surface pro which I'm going to guess is
going to be called the newer surface pro
or maybe the surface pro 2019 or well it
is Microsoft so maybe a little skip a
few numbers and it will be the surface
pro 10 do you like people spying on you
while you use the internet if you said
yes shut up I'm onto you with tunnel
there nobody can spy on you it keeps
your internet activity private from your
internet provider advertises and anyone
looking to track you or profit from your
data tunnel bear has a top rated privacy
policy and does not log your activities
and the best part is it's actually easy
to use you download it it's available
for PC Mac Android iOS they even have a
Chrome extension and you press like one
button and you are covered and it's
really nice for getting around pesky geo
restrictions you know watching videos
that are us-only yet really great for
that so try it out for free with five
hundred megabytes of data no credit card
required and then when you sign up for a
year of unlimited data save 10% by going
to tunnel bear comm slash LTT alright
