HyperX SSD this is their first hyperx
branded SSD which to me indicates that
Kingston is fairly confident in the
performance excuse me yeah I guess we'll
just keep rolling then of this
particular unit so this is featuring a
san force control letter it runs
controller controller it runs on C 236
gigabit per second and what they are
claiming is that you can improve system
performance by sixty percent and let's
find out what that asked based on PC
mark system performance sweet well I
will go ahead and say that Kingston is
entirely wrong to make that statement
completely one hundred percent wrong you
want to know why because system
performance will increase dramatically
more than sixty percent by going from a
hard drive to an SSD that is a very
conservative statement now in some
scenarios you'll see 0% this is true
however in other scenarios like for
example when you are in the middle of an
intense task and you all of a sudden you
like you want to do something else it
can perform double triple quadruple even
10 times faster than a system that's
still relying on an ancient mechanical
hard drive so this particular drive is
rated for reads of up to five hundred
and twenty five megabytes per second and
rights of up to 480 megabytes per second
it comes with a three-year warranty 24-7
tech support and it also includes a
bunch of accessories that other SSD
manufacturers do not include which I
will show you I figure if i get bak so
before we go alright it is also by far
the slickest looking SSD that i have
ever seen it is fully kingston hyperx
looking it's got a big metal x on the
top of it with a blue background with
the kingston guy in the kingston logo on
the back it has a SATA power connector
as well as a say 236 gigabit per second
data connector and some jumpers that you
probably won't need to use it has some
mounting holes on this side some
mounting holes on this side and some
mounting holes on the bottom including a
warranty void if removed
sticker so don't remove that or your
warranty will be void I have no warranty
on this particular drive though anyway
it's a very heavy it's quite heavy due
to the plastic housing would be my guess
and the metal housing is very thick
housing very robust feeling something to
bear in mind about those mounting holes
that are on the drive is that those are
standard this will fit in your notebook
it will fit in your desktop with this
adapter right here so here is a kingston
hyperx branded two and a half inch to
three and a half inch SSD adapter so you
go ahead you put your drive on there
which will look nice and sharp look at
that see Kingston Kingston considers
things this is smart because when you
put the drive on you can still see the
HyperX logo on the adapter check that
out see little things we've also got
included screws included other more
different screws so these ones are for
mounting the SSD to the adapter these
are for mounting the adapter to your
case we have a solid state drive
installation guide includes hard drive
cloning software very nice including
that hard drive cloning software is a
big value add in my opinion because
especially for notebook users it allows
you to easily move your OS from your
hard drive to your SSD they also include
a screwdriver check that out so you got
a flathead and two different Phillips
heads and it's in the convenient form
factor of a pen like object which put
the bits back in you can close back up
and then you can put it in your front
pocket and it can sit there like that
proud kingston hyperx user alright next
we have an external drive enclosure now
why would Kingston include this very
good question and I will provide you
with the answer the reason Kingston
would include this hyperx branded
external hard drive enclosure is so that
you have a way when you unlock it and
put your desktop year old desktop drive
your hard drive in there you will have a
way to a transfer the data using their
cloning software to your new SSD and be
you will have a use for your old hard
drive now so you can just go ahead and
put that cover back on
put the cover back on lock it in place
plug in the USB cable which they have
conveniently included and now you have
an external hard drive to go along with
your SSD equipped notebook they've also
included a SATA cable which if you are
installing it in a desktop you will need
so it comes with everything you need to
install it in a notebook or a desktop or
even in your shirt pocket which once
again I'm trying to demo and I don't
have one so it is not working thank you
