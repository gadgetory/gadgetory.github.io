excited about one of them is the fact
that it is finally outdoor unboxing
season again that makes me very very
happy I'm here in my t-shirt I'm outside
I'm on the bench I'm unboxing products
the other one yes the product I am
unboxing today this is an awesomely
excitingly fantastically uber Lee
sweetness product that I will be
checking out today first time I saw this
was at CES 2011 this is the MSI GTX 580
Lightning uses 16 power phases which is
four times more than a reference 570 and
twice send some to two point whatever
two point six six times more than a
reference 580 it has triple over voltage
which means that using MSI Afterburner
you can over bolt three different
aspects of the card you have the Twin
Frozr three cooler okay it's ready for
3d mark 11 which basically I guess means
it's DirectX 11 which a plenty well
better be is since it's a 580 he gives
us the military class 2 concept we have
support for MSI Afterburner GeForce CUDA
SLI physics and 3d vision don't forget
also Nvidia surround if you run 2 of
these suckers alright also inside here
we find some more information so power
for architects are the most powerful
power system on the GTX 580 tremendous
power to the GPU memory and PLL for
overclocking Talisa potential K 16 phase
power design
oh I'm sorry the reference one
apparently has eight although my quick
Google before starting this indicated
six so maybe you guys can leave some
comments and tell me which one is
correct
independent memory power looks like this
card is gonna require dual 8 pin
connectors fertilizer Pro analyzer ok
features its incredible capacitance and
crazy low ESR compared to solid caps
interesting ok popper moss
compared to traditional MOSFETs super
ferrite chokes highly conductive
capacitors these are the ones with the
tantalum core solid caps ok so all of
that good military class to stuff
lightning power layer sweet
okay so unique PCB design for the GPU
memory and power layer increases power
supply stability and eliminates power
noise needing ripple interesting all
right so this is one of the few video
cards where there's actually enough for
them to talk about that they managed to
cover this whole thing with completely
unique stuff so dual nine centimeter pwm
fans nickel plated copper base
high-density fins is all about the
cooler propeller blades which we've seen
debut on the gtx 550 ti that was the
cyclone okay super pipe technology which
means thick thick heat pipes and let's
see if there's anything else on the back
finally no no there is not so it uses
1.5 gigs of memory like a standard GTX
580 and unless you're talking like big
surround resolutions really that's
enough hmm
check this out okay so the first
accessory I'm going to show you guys
these are v checks so you can use these
to check the voltage to various parts of
your GTX 580 lightning so this is a
feature we've seen on many MSI
motherboards in the past but very few
graphics cards we've got a couple six
pin to eight pin PCIe adapters but
honestly if you're not using a proper
power supply and you're trying to run a
beast card like this you're probably
doing it wrong okay next we have a DVI
to VGA adapter also for people who are
doing it wrong and finally we have some
other stuff down here which is probably
mostly irrelevant look at that massive
sli bridges
okay MSI Afterburner we've got a quick
user's guide as well as whatever this is
okay so go ahead put that back on there
and let's get this card out of the
packaging so we can see it okay
pretty heavy I'll tell you guys that so
far although I haven't been able to have
a close look at it yet so I can't really
say much else about the card itself
other than that it is heavy and that it
comes in a an anti-static bag alright
beast love it okay so why don't we start
with the inputs and outputs the first
thing you're gonna notice is the gold
accents on these DVI ports HDMI port and
yeah check that out
DisplayPort so this is a completely
custom PCB if you didn't figure that out
already
featuring non-standard display layout so
instead of a mini HDMI we have a full
size HDMI and the DisplayPort to go
along with it we've got a 1/2 of a vent
but that's not really gonna matter too
much because if you look at the overall
design of the cooler it's quite open so
it's gonna exhaust a lot of air inside
the case as opposed to being completely
external exhaust mind you if you were
planning to install something like this
in your system and you don't have a well
ventilated case already you're probably
doing it wrong
so ok like pretty much covers the back
here so why don't we move along to sort
of the bottom so we've got our standard
PCIe 16x interface here we've got some
super pipe so you can see right there
this one and this one are both
substantially larger than the standard
heat pipes so those are the ones that
are carrying the heat furthest away from
the GPU which is clearly right about
here so over here and way out to the
other side so that they transport the
heat faster to the areas that are
further away from the GPU core itself
you can see the dense dense fin
structure I'm going to spin these fans
yeah yeah I know you're not supposed to
dense fin structure here gives it a ton
of surface area to dissipate heat this
is a monster cooler but MSI has managed
to still maintain a dual slot profile
rather than increasing it to triple slot
like we've seen on some of the
aftermarket coolers on GF 110 based
cards you've got the dual 92 millimeter
propeller blade fans so you can see the
blades of the fans are slightly
different from what we've seen on
previous after my
get MSI coolers and they claim up to 20
percent more airflow using this blade
design versus a similar rpm on a more
conventional blade design it's got a
really cool looking shroud that we're
pretty used to seeing on Twin Frozr
branded cards but I really like it so
I'll talk about its more all right we've
got a unison key so you can see there is
a black unis ink that is making contact
with the vrm it looks to be making
contact with the memory as well you've
got yet you can see a thermal interface
pad right there between the memory as
well as this unison so that's gonna be
getting a lot of direct cooling from the
fans here as well as being a passive
cooler just by just by making contact
with those components and by being a
nice big surface area because you can
see that unison is way over here it's
here it's here it's way up here just
massive now not only that but it's also
going to provide more rigidity to the
card so you can see this metal piece is
actually right along the card here and
stretches all the way back to the back
what that means is once you install this
in your case you know how you see guys
with high-end systems they got their
card installed and it's like it like
droops down like this well with this
card it's actually very very difficult
to flex the PCB because of all of the
metal structure there is to it all along
the length of the card okay you can see
out the back here we've got a 4 pin PWM
setup that is running both of those fans
so those fans are just spliced together
right about here ok so both of them are
running off of the same header we've got
you can see the time in the back of the
cooler that's kind of irrelevant
oh yeah the dual 4 pin power connectors
so the dual 4 pin power connectors are
up here this is where you're getting all
your power unlike the GTX 480 Lightning
there are only 2 as opposed to three of
them so it's a little bit less ludicrous
in terms of the power supply that's
required to run this guy but that's to
be expected as GF 110 is a more
efficient chip than GF 100 here we have
those V checkpoints so you can use those
to monitor the voltage to the GPU of the
memory as well as the PLL you've also
got a bios switch it has two settings
now we're used to seeing these on AMD
cards
the last generation or so but this is
the first time I've seen it on g-force
based cart so you can see there's a
liquid nitrogen - setting optimized for
LN - and then there's an original
setting we've also caught some V
switches so this is for memory this is
for PWM clock tuner not PLL and OCP
unlocker so we've got onboard switches
these are all covered in tape but you
can change the values if you desire okay
what else is there to say about this yes
SLI fingers so this should pretty much
reveal why it comes with its own SLI
bridges the reason is that normal SLI
bridges would be blocked by the unis Inc
here as well as all the structural
nonsense thing well not nonsense it's
good good nonsense that goes on with
this card so that's why you need a long
SLI bridge so you can plug this in make
it up over the stuff and then reach the
next over card you know what I think
that's pretty much all I wanted to say
oh we've got some like LEDs on the back
so those probably are for power phase
indication or something along those
lines crazy Russians indicating
something to me oh here's something
extreme cool one and extreme cool -
we've got some more switches over here
so maybe you guys can leave some
comments about what that one is because
that's not something that I'm familiar
with and I did not see it outlined on
the packaging so I don't know what that
particular switch is for so just want to
have a look at the back okay we'll give
you one more kind of overall view of the
card switch it back around to the front
so thank you for checking out this
unboxing of the GTX 580 lightning from
MSI don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from Ron boxing's reviews
computer videos and all
other random things whatever I feel like
uploading I suppose okay rate crazy
Russian told me what he was gesturing
about he was gesturing about the fact
that the PCB is taller than a standard
video card PCB this is the normal height
this is how tall a lightning PCB is so
this card is physically taller than most
cards sorry about that crazy Russian I
misunderstood what you were saying
because you speak with an accent story
