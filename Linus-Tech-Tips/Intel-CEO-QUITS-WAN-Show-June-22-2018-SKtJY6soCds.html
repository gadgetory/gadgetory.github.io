because I think so because there's a
huge hot spot over here and you're
really pale I think they did you look
more pale than me which I really don't
think it's true I think they actually
did it
ah that's okay you know what luke and I
have been talking before the show yeah
and the wine show is crap everything
about it is crap right now and we just
need to completely reinvent it we need a
computer that doesn't and the line is
finally comes back to way and show it's
like bark out immediate you know what I
did though so it used to reboot every
time you like jostle did a little bit
yeah and then what I did was I took it
and I went like this give it a little
bit of resilience and then while it was
on and I turned it back on and then it
was actually fine until we moved over
here so it needs another shaker so it
just needs a little like piece of
garbage computer professionals ladies
and gentlemen yeah so it needs a little
bit of that and then this wall sucks our
lights suck our camera sucks yeah like
look at that light it's pink yeah it's
actually pink yeah and then that one's a
little green and then this one is
actually a pretty decent light up too
high if it's pretty nice light yeah but
but it's it's misconfigured because I
did it that's why this is a huge house
photo super hard and you know what I
don't even care because he deserves it
but yeah and they could also use a mic
setup that doesn't have like 14 million
modules and doesn't even sound that
amazing yeah so that that's a whole
that's a whole thing the problem is that
we've tried simple ones we have well
okay try just a simple USB interface
we've tried a USB microphone we've tried
the most podcast people get separate
dynamic mics fine instead of a single
condensed fine I don't care anymore you
know what I don't care just an issue
with that might be that we're so close
you know that is that is a problem
yeah are really close yeah doesn't make
matters better but you know what you
people tuned in
you can cheat like good mythical morning
do they cheat that Mike isn't ah
so anyway where people are saying the
Mike keeps making a bumping noise hold
on let me see is there is that better
let me kill here let me get that let me
get that adjusted for you how's that we
good we have a great show we got a great
show for you guys today for topics a lot
of great topics the best topics the
greatest topics do you want to want to
do a topic a new SSD form factor from
Samsung is supposed to be three times
the storage density of you have to stay
tuned get owned that was a little rude
Wow that also Apple finally acknowledges
what an actor has keyboard issues yeah
Bethesda is suing Warner Brothers so
that's gonna be a good one and it
actually looks pretty that looks pretty
cut-and-dried and speaking of things
that got cut today like cuz they're like
they're bleeding a bit and stuff YouTube
introduces paid subscriptions and
merchandise floatplanes not going
anywhere yeah but this definitely does
alter some things about our deal pray I
don't alter it further crap he's Vader
in this situation that's not yes you're
like super white Lando yeah it sort of
capes I wear sweaters I mean who would
think to put a cape on a like seriously
legitimate suave guy these days like you
would not get away with that anymore you
gotta admire that about these alright
no I don't even want the oh crap oh now
that well you can't look at a chart I
won't be able to look I wouldn't catch
it I will mother the rest of the night
that is my bad you ruined it yes I have
not seen solo yet which means that I
can't look at anything anymore because
now you guys know yeah not that anyone
probably even cares like is it even an
impactful enough movie see I can talk
about solo as much as I want because I
have not even seen a trailer yeah I know
nothing other than that it has been an
absolute box-office flop and actually we
should we should talk about this it's
probably not even in the dock but we
were chatting about this at lunch the
other day yeah
I don't really have a link for you guys
you can probably find one where you can
just google about it but Disney has more
or less officially said do I need to go
down no I need to go up okay
Disney has more or less officially said
that they are putting a pause on all a
Star Wars story movies like rogue one
and solo and potentially a canoe which
is what everyone's really upset about
because they're like you're upset
there's no cannoli movie or they're
upset there was gonna be a Kenobi movie
because there was a Kenobi movie it was
called Star Wars Episode two Episode one
and I think they said that there isn't
just Kenobi solo movie movie it was
called Star Wars for a new hope they're
both in it okay and it was the good
Kenobi the Alec Guinness Kenobi yeah
those Hey okay he did it okay hold on a
second young Kenobi sucked but
what's-his-face Revenge of the Sith
actually not that bad yeah that's
probably fair not those movies were just
brutal in general though Revenge of the
Sith didn't and like there was a lot of
really good actors in there and their
fault Revenge of the Sith wasn't the one
with the Anakin love story no that's
attack of the clones right with those
mannequin love story in both of them
yeah but with like the horrible that
horrible scene where he and Natalie
Portman go to like that planet and they
do the secret wedding
that is the old one in the second one
because that was it was just unwatchable
didn't someone do a supercut of that
movie where they just pulled all the
love story stuff a find a machete cut or
something there's there's something yeah
there's a version of that for the last
channel so ok bearing in mind that I
haven't seen solo telegin second movie
yeah because I so I saw the first Star
Wars story row 1 or whatever it was good
I only saw it once it's the only Star
Wars movie I've only seen once even last
year I really didn't
I saw another third of last Jedi on a
plane that count has repeat watching I
don't think so it was it was the person
in front of me watching ok so you know
what just don't don't worry too much I
want I want to know what you think
justified move from Disney or no because
we'll like to talk about tech you know
what movies are Tech Star Wars is to use
cameras and stuff this camera pointed at
us it's like crappy tech but it's text
everything about this show is tech just
chill so you can justified move in terms
of putting the other ones on pause yeah
I think they need to put the other ones
on pause to reassess their side of
things because I think they are doing a
bad job
ok of handling the Star Wars franchise
hit me with hit me with some opinion
bombs then of the movie no no like what
do you think they're doing a bad job of
exactly like a I don't think anyone was
asking for a story about Han Solo
because the interesting part of Han Solo
the character happens after what I think
people were really clamoring for was the
boba fett story yeah because that's a
careful that was that's also
theoretically one that like is paused
right except that that's one that I
would have actually liked gone to see in
the opening week this is what I think
like I still think they should have
paused it it's it's the kind of
situation where like you hear a game
gets delayed it doesn't happen these
days they just release a beta and
everyone buys it anyways but back in the
day when people actually released full
games you would hear a game gets delayed
and it's kind of bittersweet it's a good
thing because you're like
okay hopefully it'll be a better launch
than it could have been yeah but I
wanted to play the darn game right it's
the camp same kind of situation here I
think if they released it in its proper
cadence it probably wouldn't have been a
very good movie got it in my opinion
because I don't think they've been
batting very well lately
okay personally right because you hated
force awakens didn't you I hated one
part of it I didn't hate it okay there's
one scene that really bugged me which
was where you know when they're they're
getting like basically bombed by the TIE
fighters when Rey and Finn first meet
yeah and Finn won't stop grabbing her
hand and trying to run away and I'm like
the only large female influence in
Finn's life was Captain freaking phasma
yeah who's like a beast machine there's
no way that he learnt to hold her hand
and run away hmm there's there's no way
that works for him his only female
influence is like a freaking boss right
and then he gets beat up by another girl
there's a all the female in his life all
the females in his life beating him up
and he's like I need to take care of you
right oh no and but then the second one
talk to me but that wasn't basically it
I like the rest of it was alright
episode 8 though there's a copycat movie
but it was alright episode 8 though
episode 8 was hot garbage pretty much
the whole thing fry I actually thought
of at one point in time making a video
that was gonna be like an hour and a
half long of me just complaining about
every single part of the movie and then
I eventually was like no because there
was I didn't really like the culture
that was around hating the movie at that
time and I didn't want Ultra is still
bad yeah and I very toxic I didn't want
to put myself in on that because I
didn't agree with the general sentiment
I just had my own complaints and my own
complaints didn't seem to be really in
line with everyone else's so I was like
I'm just gonna step away God not become
a part of this but yeah my biggest
problem was probably how bad the first
order is and how non-scary the first
order is right because like the Empire
is legitimately scary and when you beat
something that is strong and scary when
you defeat it it's then you're very
rewarded winner and yeah there's
excitement you walks dancing and all
if you like kick a baby it doesn't
really matter okay I see you just look
like an idiot
yeah the first order just doesn't make a
ton of sense to me yeah I don't really
understand where did this come from
where did it go where did it come from
first order yeah all right all right
tell you what we don't okay okay did you
have any sort of more general why you
think they're screwing it up thoughts
before we move on and talk about actual
tech stuff um does anyone even watching
the show today I don't even know we
don't have an announcement so like I
don't know how many people are actually
here probably not that means that's fine
thanks guys for being here though you
guys are awesome I appreciate it no it's
just getting to the show okay so um okay
so first order of business YouTube is
cracking down on
oh we're jumping there yeah we're
jumping to that I don't think that's
actually in the dock either no we're
just making up all our own news topics
today sorry James this is nope nope
YouTube is cracking down on creators
using the platform to announce their
availability over on other platforms so
we actually got issued a Community
Guidelines strike earlier this week yeah
for a video type that we have actually
been uploading for the last many years
yeah something like that so we have
found that announcing that we're live on
Twitch is pretty helpful for our YouTube
viewers for our Twitter followers so I
guess we could have at least on the
tweet oops and for our Facebook likers
are they called by course uh no I think
you know I think you follow a book so
I'm not really a facebook person so I'm
here I'm gonna go ahead and throw my my
screen cap on here I think yeah so we've
been doing these videos literally every
week for years and YouTube has never
said boo about them and we we know that
they haven't been propagating them to
all of our subscribers obviously but we
had theories for that like the title in
the description are identical every time
that was on purpose even yep to make it
so that people who aren't interested in
these and are never going to click on
them basically wouldn't even see them
yeah
we would generally pull them down once
the archive was up on YouTube anyway but
what happened was someone last week
forgot to pull down the we're live video
I know what happened it still happened
and it was left up and so someone at
YouTube confirmed by manual review
apparently that this video was
inappropriate content so we're gonna go
ahead and pull that up trouble shoot
video removal Community Guidelines etc
etc etc so you can appeal a strike but
there's no guarantee whatsoever that
they'll do that and so we a channel that
yes we we created a video that was
designed to drive users off platform
which I can see why YouTube wouldn't be
stoked on we are no longer allowed to
livestream so it's sending a bit of a
mixed message
so we uploaded a video saying hey we're
live-streaming you can go check us out
over here and then YouTube went how dare
you livestream somewhere else by the way
here's a Community Guidelines strike you
can no longer live stream to YouTube
which is the best way to make someone
not stream on your platform what a weird
response obviously obviously this is a
this is like a standard response to any
Community Guidelines strike like no one
was sitting in an office getting paid an
actual salary yeah to make the decision
that because we announced we were
streaming somewhere else we should
probably not only allowed to stream
you'd think if they had a Community
Guidelines strike that was specifically
based on announcing that you are alive
somewhere else you shouldn't take away
the ability so it's not it's generally
considered spam oh so they're bundle it
under that so they're calling it spam
okay and if you're a spammer I can see
how they wouldn't necessarily want you
to be live-streaming on the platform
yeah because live-streaming goes on the
top of the channel and is very
broadcasted by them the interesting
thing to me about this though is just
the fact that YouTube is I haven't
signed anything so I guess I could talk
about it they are they are actively
seeking non-disparagement agreements
from youtubers I do know this I can't
really give any details of the rest of
it but I do know
that there are people who have been
approached with some kind of an offer
that includes that we can see that they
are cracking down on people using
YouTube as a social media platform in
order to grow their base across other
platforms which previously was against
their Terms and Conditions but was
generally ignored and generally allowed
to continue and they are also building
new features that are designed to
prevent people from using off platform
services like patreon for example by
making YouTube more of a one-stop shop
now there are really good things about
this it's good but YouTube is finally
seemingly taking seriously creators
demands for better ways to monetize on
the platform because over the last year
there's been a lot of negative news
around the way that YouTube has handled
monetization especially with edgier
let's use that word edgier creators but
the bad news is that if every platform
behaved like this every social platform
has the potential to become kind of like
a jealous walled garden and it's it's
yet another move towards abstracting the
relationship between the viewer and the
creator and putting themselves squarely
in the middle so that you can never
really bridge that gap that's something
that services like patreon and of course
guys take everything I'm saying for what
it is as the CEO and co o of floatplane
media ok a company that is designed
around off YouTube monetization take it
for what it is as conflict-of-interest e
as it is extremely much so it is a scary
thing for content creators and this
isn't a new message from me or us in
general we said this far far far before
we six years ago we launched the Linus
tech tips forum actually five and a half
I guess five and a half years ago and
the reason was that we saw YouTube's
continual march in this direction of
separating the viewer in the creator and
putting themselves in the middle
so that both of them were reliant on the
platform in order to have any kind of a
relationship and we created the LTTE
forum so that worst case scenario if
something went horribly wrong we could
email at least a fraction of you and be
like hey here's where to contact us or
DM you through the forum or whatever the
case may be I actually have no idea if
we'd even be allowed to do that anymore
with all the new privacy stuff but
emailing everybody probably no because
that would be a marketing email but we
could PM everyone I guess
because that's our own inbox yeah that
would think so on an email anyway I mean
we haven't gotten to that bridge I don't
have to cross it I'd look down it cuz I
don't want that you to be really mad
with us yeah yeah so yeah yeah forget
about that the point is we wanted to
diversify ourselves and not be entirely
reliant on one basket to store all of
our eggs and there's still some validity
to that strategy and there's other other
ways we've done that as well yeah like
being on twitch but with all that said I
mean I guess this is a good opportunity
for us to segue into YouTube introducing
paid subscriptions and merchandise so
the original article here this is
supposed to by Bobby flow on the forum
this might be a no I don't think this is
a new record 15 minutes in and getting
to our first tech topic I think we've
done worse than that yeah okay so the
original articles from the YouTube blog
here posted by whoever I just said on
the forum I can't remember and I can't
see the and it's arguably a tech topic
know anything Google is tech C okay we
had this we had this conversation
I think last show where it was an Amazon
topic that had to do with like people
scamming returns that's tech how
Amazon's a tech company they're like a
Aris store that's online
do they have servers so is are there
every company a tech company
I don't like random law if you construe
that as a server if you ask Ford their
tech company no goodness they are they
actually know I would actually say yeah
they are they're reinventing themselves
to be a tech company I have that from
the I think he was the CEO right a
Ford's it took I did that sponsored
thing with them a little while ago with
that famous guy famous host guy Ryan
Seacrest oh yeah that was
I would say I met him but I really
didn't because he was in on the private
jet in that room for like 30 minutes and
then before we even realized he was gone
he was actually in a private private car
back to the airport before anyone
actually like the rest of the
influencers actually realized he was
gone to go back to the airfield to get
back on the private jet and I actually
heard a rumor about how much that cost
but I don't know if I would be like
compromising anyone I will say it wasn't
seven figures but it was um okay that's
like all yeah it was like halfway there
apparently holy crap oh geez wouldn't it
be great to be famous
yes I'm like I'm not talking like this
like crap tier like internet famous yeah
no I'm gonna be TV fame I'm talking like
household name famous that would be nuts
mind you mind you I've had enough bad
experiences with like people literally
waking me up while I'm sleeping in the
airport to take a selfie or no that's a
different level he's on a private jet no
no I know I know but like I've had
enough bad experiences with people like
doing that kind of stuff to me that I
can understand why if you were an order
of magnitude or more more famous things
you would actually not be able to walk
through an airport yeah like if you're
if you're Barack Obama how do you walk
through an American Airport have you
ever had the moment where you wanted to
go up and greet someone and then you get
like the huge wave of like conflict when
you're like what I've been in this
situation what I want to be approached
right now have you ever been in that
situation I as I have one very strong
example but I want to hear you I stood
in an elevator with Wayne Gretzky once
what oh that would be hard okay
and I just nodded I figured if I say
anything it's kind of a cool moment in
itself better not to because you know
that point he was more of a Ford
spokesman than a hockey player so like
still but he still the great one for
we're Canadians well that's a big deal
even if you don't watch hockey I'll be
up here that's so a big deal it's like
running into Michael Jordan in an
elevator except I don't know if he would
fit in an elevator but yes you go up
like the frado's we're just like sit
down terrible I mean can you even cross
your legs no a lot of that especially
like a European elevator no way pretty
narrow no way yeah anyway sorry what
were you gonna say
I saw it was at PAX West I saw
markiplier and I know he like knows of
us and all that kind of stuff and right
like oh that's exciting I want to like
go say hi for the first time in person
it was like 8:00 in the morning at a
Starbucks and he was standing there
waiting for his coffee I took one step
and was like no I'm good I'm just not
gonna he hasn't had his coffee yet he's
standing there with some lady they're
both being very quiet I don't think
because they're awkward I think cuz
they're freaking tired yeah and I'm just
like I'm just gonna it's all about time
because like I actually like taking
pictures with me to stuff like if
someone walks up and they're like hey
can I get a selfie I'm like that's cool
because it's like a taste a little bit
of ego boost yeah exactly someone like I
remembers I still remember the first
time someone asked me to autograph
something yeah just using that word I
was like well I can't autograph anything
but I'll sign it for you but it's all
about like appropriate timing so I was I
was flyering my neighborhood Oh putting
lost cat posters on people's doors last
weekend and I had someone like come up
to me will not come up to me but like
call to me from across the street
and like ask me to take a selfie with
them and I'm like you know I've got like
this bundle of flyers with me and I'm
like I've got like a roll of paper on my
wrist so that I can I'm I'm on like an
electric skateboard so I can quickly go
from door to door like I'm all about how
many houses per hour can I do right now
and I'm like literally standing there
with like a lost cat poster in my hand
like now's really not a good time I'm
trying to find my cat maybe another time
and it's just like yeah I have very
rarely had those situations but yet it
does you can see we haven't found him by
the way we did get one lead from a
really helpful neighbor who texted my
wife but and actually like it would have
been it would have been a you know
Cinderella story ending because well not
Cinderella but fairytale ending that's
what I was going for because I went and
started snooping around her yard at
night which was okay because she was
cool with it like she told us there's
been a cat hanging around and I found
the cat that's been hanging around in
your yard oh it's just and he's kind of
striped and spotted but he's not my cat
right so that sucks yeah yeah sorry that
when I when I heard the initial story I
don't know if you noticed but I didn't
ask if you found him or not because I
was like I don't really want to bring it
up know that we're kind of starting to
give up hope he's been gone for a week I
mean rocket was gone for six weeks but I
think that's an exception not rocket was
kind of a I'm a rocket was somewhat more
competent than Rumble like Rumble was
the one that we used to used to get used
to really worried about getting out
because he's such an idiot was you know
anyway so right YouTube paid
subscriptions and merchandise yeah so
with channel memberships viewers will
pay a monthly recurring fee of $4.99 to
get unique badges new emoji and Members
Only posts in the community tab along
with access to custom perks offered by
creators such as exclusive live streams
extra videos or shout outs channel
membership has already been available
for it for a select group of creators on
YouTube as sponsorships and it will soon
be expanding to Ella build eligible
channels with more than a hundred
thousand subscribers under the new name
channel memberships so they hope to
bring it to even more creators in the
coming months and they are also adding
merch stores directly to YouTube so they
have partnered up with teespring
yeah so it merch store partnerships yeah
so creators can choose from over 20
merchandise items to customize and sell
via a shelf on there
so that's available to all eligible
us-based channels with over 10,000
subscribers and they will be expanding
it in the future so thoughts from from
my standpoint I mean this was a matter
of time
you know if I'm Google or if I'm anyone
like say for example me and you Kohei
and I'm looking at the twitch model
where people are for some reason willing
to pay five dollars a month knowing that
only half of it goes to the creator then
surely there's a way to create a better
deal around that and YouTube has
apparently figured it out because and
this was like an update that I read on a
site somewhere I don't think this was
off the official YouTube blog but
apparently they will be offering a 70/30
revenue split be fair on Twitter
creators there's probably a lot more
bandwidth going through person scription
that's true like a lot yeah a subscriber
on twitch is probably watching for many
many many hours potentially many hours a
day if they watch like at work and stuff
compared to a video a day yeah that's
true that's true
it's a little bit easier for YouTube to
do this but that being said
twitch does super okay so there's also
that also not in the doc somehow but we
should really talk about this is
instagrams IG TV if you looked into this
at all like are you are a little bit
yeah yeah it's it's weird I don't really
fully get it but it might be like a
maybe I'm just old now or something but
yeah Instagram announces IG TV sound
Lynette for longer videos by longer I
don't think they they mean like five
minutes it's like an hour right up to an
hour up to an hour long videos and
they're all vertical that's another kind
of interesting part is they're designed
to be vertical videos up to an hour long
vertical videos that whole like meme of
like slapping someone in the face and
then knocking their phone sideways is no
longer gonna be applicable because you
can make our freakin long Instagram TV
videos it will still be applicable yeah
I don't laugh as a vertical if you're
settling in to watch for an hour the
shape of your field of view is like this
yeah field of view like this why
vertical not like this I
think the our thing to become and be
honest is them just being like there's
no real cop anymore yeah yeah in effect
like with the kind of videos that people
record on their selfie cans pointing at
themselves I think an hour is about as
long as you'd really want to be holding
your arm up like my my potentially out
of the loop brain is thinking that this
is just gonna create a lot more kind of
behind the scenes content on Instagram
yep and it's going to open a few holes
for those types of content I don't I
can't see this being mainline content I
know they've they've got some
interesting partnerships you mentioned
one I don't remember her name I can't
remember it looks like a Sheehan or
something like that one of the they're
all completely interchangeable to me in
the news some kind of marriage good some
kind of trouble or relationship okay
loud so I won't i won't say marriage
elijah good call or like maybe pregnant
or maybe not pregnant or I don't know or
even more controversial no longer
pregnant yeah or or that making news now
but one of them I think has some deal
for something I don't know but it has to
do with Instagram TV maybe they will do
even more selfie videos that are
slightly longer right now I don't think
there's a monetization strategy but I
think unlike Facebook which to my
knowledge outside of certain
partnerships very few bills doesn't do
an ad share with creators I think
they're open to the idea but I don't
know I read the article like a couple
days ago and I don't actually have any
notes on it I do want to hear from you
guys though
are you coming around to vertical video
um I'm gonna vote on this you're really
you're gonna vote on this alright
alright no I am for now no never
alright so this has nothing to do with
me being all floatplane I still I hate
vertical video alright now yes yes
twitch chat I can't look at you because
you're bad people who will probably
spoil solo for me well you're not bad
people you're just good people who do
bad things you have trolls yeah traulsen
so there you go guys I really need to
see your vote
on this one I'm actually you know what
I'm gonna vote on this - um I I'm a note
I'm a no never
that's what I did Wow okay this is
pretty clear this could be an audience
thing it could be that our audience is
specifically known evers or no not for
now's because there's really not that
many other look at them votes coming in
look at them look at them numbers moving
on this one and look at them numbers not
moving so much on this one the pie chart
is pretty sweet - yeah red and green is
like the whole thing basically this
again this could be a target audience
thing there's a huge community of people
especially very young people that are
just like Instagram Twitter and other
apps they're not on Facebook they're not
on YouTube as much yeah they're much
more on Instagram and Twitter and they
might be much more down for the vertical
video so my wife not only like is a
consumer of vertical video mostly on
Facebook she also even watches
horizontal video with her phone vertical
just because she finds that more
comfortable no totally phone that way no
I know I know I know it makes me so sad
more comfortable like she's like this
all the time you know what I'm about to
I'm about to go be here so she'll do
this kind of stuff where she'll take a
picture of the kids or something and
she's good about turning her phone when
she takes a picture so that's good at
least but then she'll take the picture
and she's always got her orientation
locked she'll hand me her phone to look
at it and I'm like I can't I can't even
you're using literally a third of your
screen why do you even bother having a
smartphone why don't you go back in time
and get a flip phone if all you want is
a third of the screen then you could
have hardware buttons then then you
wouldn't have to deal with all this
extra screen that you apparently can't
handle twist
divorced I'm like even Netflix man even
right yes she will watch movies like
that oh that's because I would say I was
giving a little bit of benefit don't
like if it's if it's like a two-minute
video maybe you just don't even want to
bother change the setting no no she's
basic
evil she'll also shall also watch this
this drives me nuts especially because
we have an OLED TV she will watch
Netflix content on the TV in a window
with the Start menu burning in a like
$6,000 TV because I totally took home
the w7 of course Wow right white windows
logo bottom freaking left and I'm like
wait it's already burnt in Minh like the
restore thing a couple times and it's
it's fine I don't notice it making
twitch that yikes
but like dad is a sin that's really bad
and like to me she's like oh yeah I'll
walk in I'll be like yo the video is not
fullscreen just be like I didn't notice
even happen you not how can that not be
the immediate I would notice that before

video description yeah oh I am clearly
not on my a game today someone's asking
what a scrapyard Wars coming it's coming
when it's done okay it is being edited
the first episode is rough cut okay ed
is working on at least the second
episode by now I believe it's gonna be
four episodes Oh was it four days or
three days it was four days but it was
like two of them were half days um
depending on what was going on on your
side it might be fine cuz there was a
lot going down I saw something
oh did you no I won't say what it was we
don't want to spoil it for you yes but
the no internet challenge is gonna be
real and it's gonna be pretty intense I
saw something that I very almost did Oh
like very close but didn't so it'll be
cool got it yeah all right
new SSDs from Samsung in a new form
factor so the Samsung
launched the oh crap I need to go fix
something in today's tech length episode
okay
I have no idea what that means because I
don't know what today's tech like -
episode what I'm not sure what he read
but it says in the notes here actually
let me get this posted into twitch chat
I'm not really gonna be able to get this
on screen super easily I wonder what
that even means I'm oh geez oh no I can
do this trust me
anyone play titanfall to you I was an
amazing single-player hood it doesn't
work okay he's got it set to Luke's
screen which makes no sense because it's
very specifically his screen okay
Samsung launch is 8 terabyte nvme solid
state drive in nf1 form factor the 8
terabyte is amazing but the nf1 form
factor is actually the more interesting
part in my opinion samsung has launched
the largest capacity nvme solid-state
drive to date at 8 terabytes cool the
nf1 SSD will target data focused
analytics and virtualization
requirements within data centers this is
not targeted towards consumers it's an 8
terabyte freaking crazy SSD this isn't
this I know I know I know you'd like it
but it's not really for you yet it
probably will be one day the otherwise
known as next-generation small form
factor which makes me want to cry
because calling thinks next-generation
is not a good idea because eventually
its last generation nf1 is a miniscule
form factor featuring in the form factor
measuring in at 11 centimeters by three
point zero five centimeters three times
the storage density of m dot two
it runs on 16 pieces of 512 gigabyte
nand and you know what's happening you
have no idea that would be great
welcome to an show welcome to the most
professional show there is yeah pretty
much on television we're talking about
at first when he had his first gasp I
was like oh it this
is this like NDA stuff I'm assuming it's
probably just like we said something and
then news came out later and that thing
is no longer what I'm assuming it is is
the first line of this which is probably
all he got into you
so Samsung has launched the largest
capacity and vme solid-state drive today
to date terabytes so we probably said
the largest capacity Saul's a drive is
bread and now it's been defeated
probably wrecked probably something like
that each one of these things has 16
layers of 256 gigabit v-nand with three
bits per second cells Samsung is
planning to launch another version later
this year with 512 gigabit v9 cells ooh
dang this allows for 576 terabytes of
storage to be put into 2u rack servers
576 Terrapins in to our bytes into you
so that's like that I wrote there that's
like a 1 that's probably like it's like
a two fours are like so like a store
inator
that's a to you right where's that
through you I thought those were four
okay
I haven't handled them nearly as much as
lysosome it's okay just come up that
asked me if I was a child on his screen
I think it said are you a child yes or
no 25 store Nader let me see here I'm
actually quite interested because people
are fairly familiar with that size yeah
yeah well that's like a very standard
server size it is so I just don't
remember which version of it is building
price storage server
I think the Excel 6 XL 60 I think base
you tell me for you yeah for you okay so
like half the size of this coordinator
yeah that's pretty dank yeah for like
that much storage and it's all SSD
you'll probably pay for like this
building a couple times yeah yeah in
wine what I'm assuming the cost of this
thing will be me but yeah dang it runs
on nvme one it runs on v nvme one point
three protocol and has support for PCI
4.0
dang day that's pretty crazy is that
even like standard ya know as far as I
know no that's pretty sick and
apparently withstand 1.3 Drive rights
per day equating more than ten terabytes
of Rights daily for the 3-year warranty
period and cow bites daily yeah this is
like super not a consumer product holy
crap it's not for you I know I know at
least one person I don't know if he's
watching right now but loony from the
forum is like gimmick it's not for you
loony okay it's for like the Zack yeah
yeah you want to talk about this one
Bethesda suing Warner Bros yeah I I saw
the title I didn't really look into it
too much um neither of eyes so we're in
a great boat right now
Bethesda sues Warner Bros Bethesda
Software suing Warner Bros and followed
shelter co-developer behavior
interactive over the recent release
Westworld mobile game alleging it's a
blatant ripoff
oh so it's developed by the same code EV
yeah oh yeah like this is a word yeah
it's a really big deal
Bethesda copyright infringement breach
of contract and misappropriating trade
secrets yeah so like that's it that's a
very big deal obviously I don't know
what a contract with Bethesda looks like
because that's not our business but
especially that type of contract if
you're looking at what I would assume to
be you know probably eight figures to
nine figures total tomorrow we'll make
like a game like this I and we'll the
thing is there's also recurring yeah
contracts and the contracts like overall
total development contract or something
like this it's gonna be I'm over at it's
at least a seven-figure thing I have no
idea but it's a massive amount of money
so if you're looking at that there's
gonna be some pretty significant
confidentiality agreements in there
there's gonna be some non-compete stuff
in there
so essentially what they've done is
they've created the same game or a very
similar game I guess for a direct
competitor yeah so yeah I would assume
that this was not gonna be very very
pleased with that
Bethesda alleges that Westworld released
this week Android and iOS has the same
or highly similar game design art style
animation
features and other games like oh boy it
really does
you can't show my screen okay but if you
just Google West world mobile game and
go to images oh man they really didn't
what looks like a reskin oh my god looks
like a reskin seriously that which
screen in my question um he's back like
check out this one yeah but note on here
look screen line screen Oh Luke screen
oh I didn't I didn't oh good it didn't
hit the computer it did the thing where
it freezes my I touch it again wow I
haven't even like played a game but that
like definitely looks like it it's
really similar see yeah I didn't realize
it's the same kiss same code EV did the
west-world one yeah that's like real old
man real bad
yeah oh man we interrupt the show I was
like this is gonna be this is gonna be
bad I mean like not even okay my biggest
thing is this character looks really
similar tomorrow wow like the art style
is almost the frickin same it's it's not
like they're like oh it's a multi-tier
underground thing with some rooms
you gotta maintain it like that's like
okay it's another battle royale game
whatever this is like mmm have you even
talked about the part where there's a
bug that's present in both games oh no
no no it gets so much worse negative
ESDA says the game uses the same
copyrighted computer code created for
fallout shelter in West world alleging a
that a bug evident in an earlier version
of fallout shelter which was later fixed
also now appears in West world I mean
I'm not a lawyer but I'm just gonna go
ahead and say that but that so probably
has a case here oh my goodness be yeah
I'm no expert but yeah behavior is like
the studio that was working on it that
the shortened version so behavior
breached his contract with this as
Bethesda and utilized its restricted
access to possesses intellectual
property including Bethesda's
copyrighted code trade secrets and and
other rights to make a new game on the
which mean from the outside yeah kind of
sounds like it looks uh looks like they
might have something going out there
pretty brutal that's that's gnarly
when I first flicked on this I was kind
of suspecting like oh it's another
Battle Royale thing where people are
copyrighted concept like the arts almost
identical it's just like looks pretty
damn lightly it looks like you bought a
West World costume for the Fallout game
and like a West world room skin who are
the Fallen who would think that that's
gonna fly like I just don't even like
your your your professional game
developer buy some you know beg probably
I'd be apparently not but someone who
works there thinks their professional
game developer and they it hasn't
occurred to them that IP law is like a
big problem yeah and the kind of thing
that a company like Bethesda would spend
a lot of money to protect yeah and like
I've brought up pub G or a battle royale
a few times in this yeah and pub G has
sued a lot of people that has actually
made a ton of sense where it's like
almost the exact same game and there is
some interesting points with there
fortnight thing which is like the the
plane comes in on pub G and the bus
comes it's a freaking plane come on
fortnight yeah like it's almost the same
in that way but then fortnight has the
benefit of having like the building
features and like all these other weird
things that really set it apart that
helps them a lot in their case right
there I don't think there's there's much
in this one yeah oh geez and like the
art in fortnight looks drastically
different than the art in pop G and that
helps them a lot to you um okay last
last big topic here Intel CEO has
resigned after a consensual relationship
with an employee because that's when he
eighteen we like really meet well yeah
that's important so he's like definitely
broken company policy yeah but he's not
like getting wrapped up in the whole
hashtag me too
yeah yeah yeah so basically intel has
announced that he has resigned as CEO it
makes a little sketchy that we have
consensual relationship in quotes oh
well okay it's like actually it can
relationship everything's okay so anyway
he's resigned to CEO following an
investigation into a consensual
relationship with an Intel employee
which is another way of saying he was
fired he also left the board even so
he's like out of the company uh chief
financial officer Robert Swan will step
in as interim CEO like another
indication that you were fired is that
there has to be an interim CEO because
that doesn't have something lined up
there's nothing lined up yeah and
basically he violated a policy that said
that managers cannot have relationships
with people who report to them either
directly or indirectly and when you're
the CEO that means everyone yeah I would
think I'm actually making an assumption
there which is officially why we can't
be in a relationship the relationship
ended and took place sometime back
whatever that means and most probably an
affair Cruz and his total compensation
topped 21 million last year
so he's and the company paid for his
transportation and residential security
this his Intel stock rose about 120
percent during his tenure as CEO 21
million dollars a year that works out -
hold on a second so calculator so 21 one
two three one two three divided by how
many oh you know what I know but I know
the hourly calculation that is ten
thousand dollars an hour if you worked
40 hours a week oh my god right cannot
be right that's pretty insane Wow Wow
Brian I think you'll be okay even though
he's probably not getting his golden
parachute he sold all of his stock and
that are not all like half of his stock
in that high-profile thing around the
meltdown inspector buds yeah but if he
has to sell what I'm assuming is one of
his many homes or cars I'm sure he'll
he'll be fine yeah he'll figure like he
made enough money that I'm sure he has
enough assets that it really won't
matter I I don't know man I he's not
gonna have to go be a greeter or
anything I really know my friends degree
ders I'm just saying I really don't I
don't understand how any person
can be that valuable because you know
you know like we talked about how you
know um well do you know what do you
know what Elon does have you heard about
the CEO salary thing not to toot his
horn anymore but and I'm guys got enough
of a bubble at this point yeah yeah and
I'm not gonna bother look it up but it
was like comparing the difference
between the like lowest paid employee
and the CEO at different companies yeah
what the percentage of whatever his was
0.9 the reason for that is because he
gets like crazy stock options and all
this other kind of so this was total
compensation not a salary okay there's
quite a bit so I don't know I I don't
know I I have I have trouble with I have
trouble with that in ten thousand
dollars an hour yeah because if you
think okay think about it in terms of
like like slavery we all agree it's
wrong freaking I hopes we have we all
agree it's wrong we all agree it's wrong
with those kind of kinds of resources
could a person effectively own another
person 24 hours a day seven days a week
for the rest of their life yeah does
that give you enough power to do
something like that well you could you
could own three people at eight hour
shifts very very very very easily so I
don't know I just literally three people
at eight hour shifts you could pay them
with like the the last two digits before
the dot yeah I don't know man it says I
don't know
apparently Broadcom CEO made a hundred
million last year don't even do with a
hundred million dollar one of my
favorite things is when a company is
just tanking and I CEO gets like all the
toys are resting was a disgusting mess
I'm not familiar
they basically raided the company and
then walked off with golden parachutes
and people who'd been working there 20
years as a cashier or shelf stocker
whatever got nothing is gross yeah
alright anyway on that happy note hey
that's it for the wine show for today
and we'll see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel now I'm
ready
oh right
fish birds spectrum glasses who knows
coffee probably already missed out on
the first 50 orders there but I don't
know give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
