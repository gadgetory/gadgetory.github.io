Computex 2015 this year we wouldn't be
here without them and thank you also to
lynda.com all right guys welcome back to
the msi booth where we are checking out
the ax 24 which is an a i/o computer
that is able to use a full desktop sized
GPU and CPU also we have an update to
their gaming dock which is the gaming
dock mini which Linus is probably gonna
be a lot more happy about the ax 24 can
fit a like I said desktop CPU it's not
coming out yet so it will be compatible
with skylake CPUs once they're available
and now this is a set so you get a
skylight CPU you get 64 gigabytes of RAM
that's four sticks at 16 gigabytes 2 m
dot 2 slots 4 drives which can raid
together a two and a half inch drive
slot and a blu-ray drive I'm so sorry so
sorry it unfortunately doesn't come with
a Paul you're a i/o computer does not
come with it Paul gotta go but that
graphics card does have a PCI gen3 16x
slot so you won't have any degradation
in the graphics card that you have now
the GPU does require dedicated power
along with the rest of the AIO so this
will require 2 power plugs going
directly to it and right now there's a
kind of oddly Genki HDMI cable using the
HDMI IN for that graphics card but
that's only required for certain
operating system configurations that
will probably be solved later so you
won't need it now HDMI in I just
mentioned IO it has an HDMI IN in the
back to HDMI outs two USB 3.0 2 USB 2.0
2 audio jacks and a killer Gigabit LAN
jack it also has a o on the side which
is dual USB 3.0 one SDXC card reader and
one power jack on the top of the unit
you have your power button a slider to
cover your webcam which is absolutely
pretty cool
considering certain things that have
been happening lately and a handle for
people that want to carry this around to
LANs or if they want to bring it to work
or whatever the heck handles are cool so
that's pretty badass
no more compromises for a IO you have a
full desktop size graphics card which
will be able to cool itself very easily
through that meshing that's on the front
if it's a blower or non blower style
card that'll be totally fine and it can
exhaust out through the IO side of the
graphics card or on all the perimeter
sides of that cooler there is spacing so
it can expel air depending on what
type of cooling solution that graphics
card has and you have a desktops
processor you have you have 64 gigs of
ram you pretty much everything you'd
need and it's all in a i/o computer
pretty cool configuration next up we
have the gaming dock mini for the GS 32
M shadow which has a ton of improvements
over the previous gaming jock you no
longer need an external keyboard mouse
and monitor you can use the ones on your
laptop or use external ones it's kind of
up to you but I expect a lot of people
are going to be using the ones on the
laptop as that's gonna be easier in many
situations now if this is a home dock
which is never ever moving then sure
that's great get your external mouse
keyboard monitor all that kind of stuff
but if you ever want to move this dock
around you could get all the power of
that GPU while using your laptop's
monitor your laptop's keyboard and your
laptop's Mouse the power supply or lack
thereof as before in the previous
version of this you needed a full
desktop size power supply with this one
it just has an adapter from the wall is
able to support 330 watts of power
directly to that graphics card in terms
of i/o it's the same as before on the
right hand side you have dual audio
jacks and Ethernet jack four USB 3.0
Jack's your power input and a power
button and on the left-hand side you
have all the i/o for the graphics card
what is really different about this and
what really makes it a lot better from
the previous version is the ID or the
general design before it was this big
cumbersome box that you had to use all
these accessories for was really
annoying to move around and you needed a
desktop power supply now it has an
adapter directly to the wall instead of
a desktop power supply the ID is slanted
so you can actually properly use the
keyboard for the laptop on it and you
don't have to use an external keyboard
mouse or monitor which makes it a lot
more usable in a lot more situations
alright guys what do you think about msi
putting desktop graphics cards in
freaking everything can we even call
them desktop graphics cards anymore let
me know what do you think I think it's
awesome they all thinks it's a desktop
graphics card should be everywhere can I
put a desktop graphics card on me why
not you can there we go put a bunch of
them on and wear them like armor like
armor armor desktop graphics cards em
