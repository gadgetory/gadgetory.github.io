coursers new flagship headset this is
the Vengeance 2000 now the Vengeance
2000 is not just like you know the
Vengeance 1500 plus 500 more or even the
Vengeance 1300 plus 700 more is
completely different than that
the Vengeance 2000 is a unique SKU and
that it is wireless so you can see
there's like radiating signals of
wireless nasai of this yes there we go
out of this USB dongle right here so
what you do is you plug this in to your
computer directly or ideally you
actually don't plug it into your
computer directly but you rather plug it
into this doohickey right here like that
and then you put it somewhere where
it'll be closer to your you know face so
that you can get a proper Wireless okay
we're just gonna put these away for now
we're done with that
my entire prop use for those headsets is
finished let's show you what it comes
with and then we'll talk a little bit
about what makes this headset special so
one is stop don't return this to the
retailer two is warranty guide okay
next we've got a safety leaflet right I
just like spit on myself was disgusting
okay safety leaflet prohibit prohibition
of disassembly don't take apart the
battery cell oh I understand safety
don't dispose of and fire all that good
stuff Quick Start guy I'm assuming plug
the thing into the thing in all
likelihood okay
included stuff getting started whole
padded headband make sure you don't like
you know inhaler
moving right along plug in the dongle
plug in the extension uh hi you can
charge the oh yeah this so you can
charge the headphones using the included
cable okay cool then looks the battery
life indicator is green disconnect the
headset from power cable and get go in
alright general tip suggest for comfort
okay cool
so all that sounds pretty
straightforward let's see what Corsair
says is special about this before we get
a little bit more into it so this is a
wireless 7.1 gaming headset so I think
what of Corsair means by that is virtual
7.1 because they're only our two drivers
however with the effects you actually
can hear positional audio which is kind
of neat personally I'm more of a 2.0 guy
when I'm using my headphones I find I
can figure out the directionality just
fine but it comes down to the preference
of the individual user and you don't
have to put it in 7.1 mode 50 millimeter
drivers just like their other headphones
so that means we're not using teeny tiny
tinny drivers but rather bigger ones
that can actually deliver some bass
great okay optimize positional audio up
to ten hours of battery life and
honestly guys if you're on a raid for
more than ten hours straight
I get wired headphones okay free
yourself up to ten hours of battery life
and a range of up to forty feet cool
okay use audio cues to look at your
component your your your components your
opponents okay large 50 millimeter
drivers okay we've pretty much covered
this plate for hours padded heaven let's
you playing covered forever so you can
even use the vendors mm when it's
recharging via the included USB charge
cable okay so there you go
you don't have to get wired headphones
in fact what you can do is after 10
hours of rating you can be all like oh
shoot my headphones I can't hear anyone
no one can hear me you can plug them in
plug it into your computer and keep on
going great the Corsair advantage long
history building enthusiast great memory
and components and I think that pretty
much speaks for itself
alright warranty wise what do they got
on here usually they have some kind of a
warranty message on the box and you know
what let us find that out for you and
we'll be back in just a moment yes a
two-year warranty just like their other
headsets we had to search for it though
usually it's on the package in this case
it is on the back of the QuickStart
guide so let's go ahead and have a
closer look at the product itself so you
can see that it clearly plugs in via USB
and attaches to the headset just like
this now this dongle sticks out on the
side but in most cases won't interfere
noms
okay so let's wireless obviously however
the charging cable I'll show you guys
where that plugs in right on the back of
the left ear cap right here it uses
micro USB so you don't have to use the
included Corsair cable but you can and
it's pretty boss see it's got like a
clear sheath around it and then the
other end is like the Corsair blue USB
cable that also looks pretty boughs just
like there are keyboards and mice you've
also got on the side a volume adjust
wheel which has got that nice cross
hatch the metal ii thing going on which
is very very comfortable as well on this
side you find no buttons hold on okay
slick pointed out that apparently i'm a
moron because I couldn't find the power
button and it's obviously right here so
that's the power button there's your
power indicator volume there that's
pretty self-explanatory know that I've
had it pointed out to me the most
obvious possible fashion check this out
memory foam inside the ear cups which
are the usual comfy-cozy ear cups that
coursers using they are very very
comfortable I actually recommended
someone get a 7h headset because I
personally really like the 7h however
they ended up being really unhappy with
them because they weren't comfortable
enough so I actually traded my pair of
Corsair Vengeance 1300 s because the
guys got a really high-end sound card
and didn't want to use the USB 1500s and
just took the seven H's back from the
guy was like look sorry I recommended
that see if this works for you the guys
couldn't be happier he's like yeah these
are fantastic because between the memory
foam the large ear cups that will
accommodate even large ears and the size
of your head and the hugeness of the
adjustable nasai mean look this is how
big your head could be and the vengeance
would fit just fine like your head could
be like this it could be like wool like
alien head guy and no problem not that
I'm saying that people who need to you
know open it up all the way have alien
heads because that might alienate some
of my viewers but that's not what we're
going for here so moving right along
boom mic so it's just like that
okay you got holes here holes there that
should help with noise cancellation
alright I covered the memory for
already I covered that they're
comfortable already you got a plethora
material with also more foam padding
here and for whatever reason foam
padding on the top I mean realistically
you may wear them like this so the foam
padding on the top is actually quite
essential also with foam padding on the
top if you're playing a game you're all
like ba-bam fragged you and someone like
totally throw something at you and he
hits the foam it's gonna be like and
it's not even gonna hurt at all so
that's what's really great about that as
well you've also got cool metal accents
okay they're made of plastic but they
look like metal as well as other metal
accents that once again are made of
plastic but they look really cool and if
you like shine them up then they're like
super fun you know look it's like and
then I don't even know if I caught him
about whatever and I think that pretty
much covers it I mean ten hours of
operation you just kind of plug it in
whenever you're not using your computer
which is fine Wireless really is
convenient and latency wise I can't
imagine that this would add any not this
I mean um this Wireless this would add
latency that's any worse than what
you're already experiencing over your
internet connection with teamspeak event
or mumble or whatever it is you're using
so I really don't see a downside to
wireless gaming equipment in this
context thank you for checking out this
