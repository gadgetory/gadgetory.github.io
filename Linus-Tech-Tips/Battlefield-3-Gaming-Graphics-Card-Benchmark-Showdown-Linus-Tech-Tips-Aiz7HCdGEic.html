gaming promo calm welcome to our
battlefield 3 GPU showdown where we take
four different price points $100 $200
$300 and $400 all of these are sort of
US dollars and you know Canadian US
pricing ish and we find out what's the
best video card for you in a given price
point putting AMD and NVIDIA
head-to-head at those different price
segments let's start with our test bench
we've got a 30 960 X at 4 gigahertz with
a corsair h 100 cooling it off 16 gigs
of 1600 megahertz memory on a in the
Zeus p9 x79 deluxe motherboard our video
card varies obviously we swapped them in
and out depending on what we need to do
and powering this whole thing is an
antique high current Pro 1000 watt 80
plus platinum power supply we also have
a 128 gig boot SSD where we run all the
benchmarks off to prevent any kind of
weird like loading time glitch from
causing any kinds of issues and without
further ado let's get into it
methodology wise it's pretty simple we
do a two-minute run-through at the
beginning of the comrades level we
always run in 1080p and if you want to
replicate our run-through you can check
out our separate videos showing exactly
how we generate these results I'd like
to introduce our contenders at the
approximately $100 price point we've
brought this guy the 7770 at 1 1999 the
GTX 650 at 1 $14.99 the GTX 660 at 220
999 the 7870 at 239 the 660ti at 289 the
7950 at 299 the GTX 670 which is
actually on the test bench over there at
369 and the 7970 at 390 for now we try
to get things as close as we can we use
the second lowest price point for any
given GPU on NCIX to determine what
where these cards fall into place I mean
a lot of people have asked us where's
the 680 well it's priced significantly
higher than any of the other cards so
it's
not bear unfortunately because in some
territories 7970 might be close to 680
but here it isn't really so that just
leads us to the results and this one's
actually pretty close
so the 7770 versus the GTX 650 the 7770
pulls away by about 10 percent but it
costs about 5 percent more so it's
pretty darn close to a tie next up we've
got our next price bracket so this one
we didn't really stay that close to 200
here we got a little bit over so the gtx
660 is 230 bucks and the HD 7870 was
around 240 but this is such a good value
price point that we sort of went that
route anyway you're usually better off
to spend a little bit more so in this
case we saw the same thing where the
7870 pulled ahead by about 12 13 percent
but if the 660 was a little bit less
expensive so again sort of a sort of a
wash if I had to give the nod to someone
it'd be two AMD on that one next up 7950
versus 660ti both of these are great
overclocking cards both of these are
great value cards around the $300 price
point but the nod goes to the 79 50 on
this one because while it only costs
about three percent more it outperforms
the 660ti once they're both overclocked
to the max by about 10 to 12 percent so
a significant victory there I guess if
you would call that a significant
victory and then last but not least 79
70 versus 670 the 670 didn't perform as
well as we would have liked to see and
the 7970 did beat it by about 10% but
it's about 10% more expensive so I guess
that's okay then so there you go guys
it's kind of hard to go wrong this is
the thing that happens with mature
drivers this is a bit of an older game
so we're using release drivers on all
the cards with slightly older games and
with product stacks that have had
pricing adjusted already to compensate
for all the other products that exist in
the market what you find is that they
deliver performance that's pretty much
on par with what you'd expect for the
price you're paying so if you're playing
battlefield 3 go AMD go Nvidia it looks
like a
really matter because the game does not
support physics so you're not going to
get any benefit on that side however I
guess if you were gonna play in surround
you may want to go AMD because I do find
