or Core i5 processor and get a free copy
of Rome 2 total war click now to learn
more today we're going to be checking
out what SteelSeries has described to me
as their best headphones or headset ever
if however it features the same loose
ugly bass approach as most other gaming
headsets then I'll just have to say that
don't impress me much we say that a lot
in Canada
lots of famous Canadians have said that
so let's get the Box open inside we'll
find all the cables we need to connect
via USB to a PC or Mac with the included
will be 7.1 Virtual Surround USB sound
card via analog to a computer or really
any other device which allows audio
snobs like me to use a separate amp and
DAC such as an objective 2 and Oh doc
from Mayflower and finally a mobile
adapter using steel series as
handy-dandy swappable cables here so
that you can use it on your phone or on
your tablet
both the headphones and the microphone
physically moving on to the headset
itself there's nothing too surprising
about the Siberia elites
they have a very distinctively Siberia
look with bare padded no adjustments
necessary suspension mount system and
the elite part of the equation is
definitely present as well the top bands
are now made of metal instead of plastic
the ear cups can glow any of 16.8
million colours when you're using USB
although it doesn't work on analog the
retractable mic now has an LED indicator
for mute and on top of all of that the
padding is now thicker and more plush
all around they are heavier than Siberia
v2 s but they're still quite comfortable
and I feel like all of those upgrades
plus the significantly improved drivers
for better sound quality make them
worthy of the new name speaking of sound
quality I really feel like SteelSeries
is one of the few gaming brands that
actually gets it
the 7h horrible durability issues aside
was one of the best sounding gaming
headsets I've ever heard
and it actually won me over from my
sennheiser HD 5 5 5 s at the time so
when SteelSeries told me rarrrr is the
best ever rob about this one it did set
some pretty high expectations for me
after spending some time with the
Siberia elites listening to my customary
crappy top 40 music and playing some
Batman Arkham origins to get my gaming
time in with them I can safely say my
expectations were met are they
equivalent to the best $200 audiophile
grade headphones that don't have on your
controls for volume or LED lighting
effects or a built-in noise cancelling
microphone or an included sound card
with features like virtual surround EQ
and mic compression for leveling out the
transmitted volume of your voice no
they're not but we have to be realistic
do they get blown out of the water by
the aforementioned audiophile brand
headphones no they don't
unlike most gaming headsets the Siberia
elites aren't a complete mess of loose
sloppy bass &amp;amp; tinny highs their response
curve is reasonably flat giving them a
clean natural sound bass is solid mids
are good highs are good they sound good
really good even they sound good and
they have features that gamers care
about like all the stuff I mentioned
before excellent comfort and even little
stuff like this cool little share port
here that lets you have a friend plug in
and listen to the same thing as you
lately I've been using Sennheiser HD 600
s or Denon a HD 600 headphones on my PC
so expecting SteelSeries to win me over
to their headsets again with a product
whose MSRP is half as much as those
other two isn't realistic however good
it might sound but for the first time in
a while I've got a premium gaming
headset that while expensive isn't a
total write-off and I would feel ok if
someone bought it if you don't already
own a great pair of headphones and
you're looking for an all-around
performer with lots of features you know
like if you just you just want a mic
built into your damn headset you don't
want something on your table you don't
want to clip on or whatever else lots of
people have reasons for wanting headsets
the Siberian elite while expensive is a
gaming audio product that I can actually
recommend great work steel series now
I'm just looking forward to trying out
the H
wireless or have I tried it already and
that's the reason that I'm teasing it
because it's a very very interesting
product anyway guys like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment and let us know join
the fray enter the debate gaming audio
products our headsets ok or do you
always recommend buying dedicated
headphones and then some other
microphone solution would love to hear
