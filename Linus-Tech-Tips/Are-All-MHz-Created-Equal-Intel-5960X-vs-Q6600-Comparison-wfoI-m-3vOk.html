asked all the time are all megahertz the
same let's talk about that the Cohen
master Noma Touch tkl utilizes genuine
taupe or hybrid capacitive switches and
is now available at a more affordable
price click now to learn more good tech
tips morning I love GMM but what we're
here to talk today about is the myth of
megahertz not the awesome antics of
rhett and Link so let's set the stage
there are many things that will
determine a processors effective speed
when handling tasks but two of the most
common ones are clock speed which is a
given and IPC also known as instructions
per clock which we only hear a lot when
it's thrown around as the banner of IPC
improvements with every new processor
launch right about now is when I'll get
you guys to click on the box to go check
out the fastest possible episode
explaining IPC but I don't have one as
of yet so what I would suggest is you
check out the kind of somewhat rough
Wikipedia article on the topic and other
various sources we'll try to get a video
about that out fairly soon IPC isn't
necessarily just as simple as it sounds
at first but Intel claims generation
after generation to have a usually
around 10 percent general improvement
does this improvement actually amount to
anything wouldn't an old processor
running at 2.4 gigahertz run just as
well as a new processor running at 2.4
Jigga Jigga hertz and even if the
improvements do amount to something will
this show up in non real world synthetic
tests only or will it actually be
noticed let's find out the tools of the
trade for today will be 2 different test
machines one will be lionesses scrapyard
wars machine
you haven't seen scrapyard wars first of
all I'm genuinely surprised and second
of all click here or something and then
come back later we will be using the Q
6600 that which is running in his system
at 2.4 gigahertz rocking for standard
cores and no hyper threading alongside 8
gigabytes of RAM and a freaking gtx 980
from gigabyte windforce
just to push the GPU bottleneck out of
the way and see how effective the
processor actually
is it handling things our second system
will be the standard GPU test bench
machine with its smugly running 59 60 X
but today it won't be running normally
I've nerfed to the 59 60 X down to 2.4
gigahertz and 4 colors with no
hyper-threading to match the clock speed
and core count of the cue 6600 if you're
interested in how core count can affect
things
check out my recent video here on course
for gaming then I slapped 8 gigabytes of
RAM onto the bench and the same win
force gtx 980 to even things up
in order to put these two systems
against each other I picked a suite of
seven different benchmarks three
different synthetics and four games I'll
start up with a forum favorite and that
would be Cinebench r15 check out the
awesome Cinebench r15 thread and other
ARS actually on the forum as you can see
there's been a whopping 55 percent
improvement that's pretty huge even
given the seven-year gap between these
two processors and with our new fancy
new chip majorly nerfed just for this
experiment 3d mark and 7-zip tests were
fairly similar with the 59 60 X actually
slapping around the old weary cue 6600
but none of this was all that surprising
but it's time to move on to stuff that
you're probably more interested
real-world gaming performance first up
we have Tomb Raider which showed
essentially no difference between the
two I really need to stop using Tomb
Raider for anything other than GPU tests
because it really doesn't scale with
anything other than GPUs at all
well that story was boring so moving on
next up we have Far Cry 4 which as we
know from the course for gaming video
isn't all that CPU bound unless you
count not running on dual cores but
regardless we do see a bit of an
improvement here and that's nothing to
scoff at but this is where it starts
getting interesting dying light fairly
substantial difference in average FPS
between the Q 6600 dipping all the way
down to 15 fps at times for minimums and
the 59 60 X holding a cool 25 FPS for
minimums also note that whenever there
was a slightly more intense zombie
action going on it would chug a bit and
even crashed a few times on the Q 6600
not a great experience last of all and
oh did I save the best for last is
cities skylines we just recently
introduced this game into our testing
suite and damn does it love processors
and
really shows here with the key 6,600
there were stutters all freaking over
the place it couldn't run 4k and it was
barely able to manage itself at 1080p
and it was just a horrible experience
meanwhile the 59 60 X was just chillin
no big deal so in conclusion what does
all this mean well I hope it helped us
show how things can improve more
drastically over time than most the easy
to read specs actually show if you're
already happy with your late gen
processor you don't need to run out and
replace it the second it doesn't matter
there are always other things that you
can do as well overclocking can help a
ton and you can just not run all your
games at max like we just did that can
help too but if you are a speed freak
and you've been struggling to figure out
why your older overclocked processor
isn't performing quite as well as your
buddies stock processor running at the
same frequencies hopefully this will
help speaking of better than dessert
