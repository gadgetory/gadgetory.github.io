eye at NAB this year it promised you a
reliable system for capturing quality
audio particularly if you're a one-man
band kind of shooter but does it deliver
on that promise let's find out oh yeah
and if you guys have any interest in
seeing a manly cable management guide
where Linus Cable manages his desk in a
manly way
like this video
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click now to learn more
audio especially for beginners can be
one of the most overlooked parts of
making videos but pros know that even
the best video with rubbish audio
provides an awful experience for the
viewer so we've been using Sennheiser g3
Wireless lavalier system for quite a
while now and it's been great but comes
with a few minor inconveniences like the
talent and the camera operator needing
to shout across the room to diagnose
things like one of the packs being dead
the AV X by contrast is made with
simplicity in mind there are no settings
to tweak and it works mindlessly so that
the operator can focus on making a good
video the AV X comes in a few different
flavors depending on your needs our kit
included the AV x receiver a handheld
mic transmitter the body pack
transmitter Sennheiser standard me2
lavalier and various accessories and
cables physically the AV x receiver is
quite small compared to the Sennheiser
g3 shedding most of the bulk by using
its own proprietary battery on the right
side of the receiver you will find three
buttons AF out check / power and pair as
well as LEDs that display battery
information and pairing status on the
left side of the receiver we have the
male 320 degree rotating XLR input which
paired with Sennheiser's hotshoe
accessory allows you to position the
transmitter in the ideal placement for
your setup moving on to the body pack
while the style is quite different from
the g3 your talent will feel right at
home with a familiar mute button on the
top a mic input a digital display that
shows connection strength and battery
life and on the left side of the unit we
have the power and para buttons lastly
we have the Sennheiser handheld
transmitter which comes standard with
the MD 42 mic capsule the handheld
transmitter sports a similar display to
the body pack and has a power and pair
button on the bottom of the unit now I
mentioned proprietary battery packs
which would normally have resulted in me
ending the video right here declaring
the AV X and utter failure of a product
but sanitizer is fortunately smarter
than that and equipped each pack with a
micro USB power input so while you could
purchase extra battery packs for long
shoots I'd recommend grabbing a cheap
external battery bank and strapping it
to your rig with something like a bongo
tie Sennheiser claims 4 to 5 hours of
battery life for the receiver and 11
choice for the transmitters which seemed
accurate based on my use of the AVX
online aces latest personal rig update
2015 which you can watch here
and the receiver automatically detects
phantom power coming from a camera or
audio recorder turning itself off if fan
power is not detected to save you
battery life a nice touch so let's talk
about what the AVX was actually like to
use the pairing process is quite
painless I simply had to hold the
pairing buttons for three seconds on
both the transmitter and the receiver I
wanted to use and the audio was up in no
time
once pairing was complete the unit would
connect to each other in a mere five
seconds once powered on this is where I
began to see the benefit of the AV X's
simplicity there have been times where
we have fussed with the incorrect
channel and gain configuration with our
g3 kit things that contribute nothing to
the quality of our content and just
waste time so instead of having the user
decide on a channel the AVX actively
searches for the cleanest channel
available over a 1900 megahertz band
increasing signal strength or changing
channels on-the-fly at signs of
interference range was surprisingly
solid even at a distance and through
walls so I'm pretty impressed with the
range of the AVX currently I'm standing
on our not finished b-roll set and EDD
is actually standing in Linus's office
behind one of the windows that's a fair
distance away and it's more than we
would ever shoot in terms of distance
for using the AV X for audio pretty
impressive now the big question you
might have for me at this point is how
does it sound well in my opinion quite
good since we've been using the AV X for
this video since the beginning what
surprised me most was how well
Sennheiser is implemented Auto gain
control with even Linus being an unable
to clip the audio in a significant way
with all of his excited yelling Brendan
what is this doing here
Brendan how many times do I have to tell
you stop leaving your cotton balls
everywhere and for those wondering how
the handheld mic transmitter sounds have
a listen so here's an example of what
the Sennheiser AVX handheld transmitter
sounds like I'm currently sitting in the
new office warehouse where I'm testing
the mic going into a zoom h5 recorder so
in conclusion the a VX delivers on its
promise of simplicity while not
compromising on audio quality I see it
being used by all the shooters in
one-man bang kinds of situations where
they're doing everything from producing
camera and audio but also for those of
who are looking for an easy-to-use
quality audio solution however be
prepared to pay a premium for the ease
of use with the price of the AV X coming
in at almost 50% more than a standard g3
kit with the same mic personally I plan
on implementing the AV X when we do our
show coverage going forward speaking of
going forward mass drop has another one
but our killer deals on their site today
