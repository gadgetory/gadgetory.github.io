would choose but it would be for the
shallowest possible reasons so the thing
about corsair products is they're kind
of like okay well here's our here's our
product and then here's our extremely
premium product and pretty much no
matter what you buy you know you're
getting Corsair quality so you know you
could potentially buy like you know a
vengence kit and you're still getting
course our quality you're still getting
a lifetime warranty so you got that
going for you so for me when it comes
down to with their performance stuff is
it's all about sex appeal
Dominator Platinum's are so sexy this is
like the heaviest Ram I've encountered
in a very long time
and it is also just it looks so good so
here don't look at them okay okay iconic
heat spreader design with customizable
light bar upgrade kits available at
Corsair calm cool stuff so you can
actually make it so it like matches and
integrates in your system even better
okay supports Corsair link technology
which means you can monitor your memory
performance and that's cool too dual
path DHX cooling technology for
optimized heat dissipation this we've
had for a long time since the dominators
and there are other DHX models as well
so now let's get into the memory itself
so this particular kit there's nothing
that special about the spec this is an
1866 kit it's 2 by 8 gig its cl9 1.5
volts so yeah it's a good memory kit but
it's not like you know they're they're
crazy Dominator platinum kid that was
clocked at well what was it 2.8
gigahertz or something stupid later you
know I'm going to go look it up set yeah
3 gigahertz so this is not that kit this
is just sort of your your bit mainstream
slash performanc like still a very good
skew memory but like look
get it when you put it in a motherboard
though okay so you get like your public
of gamers board from a Sue's you got
like that Dominator thing going on on
the top so the customizable light bar is
the one that if you guys know anything
about me you know I love case lighting
and all you have to do to change out the
light bar so you can actually see these
ones are white so they have like a
frosted strip so that it dissipates the
light and a pretty pretty cool way
you've also got heat sinks for heat
dissipation this can be removed using
using it works or allen key looks like
an allen key so so no difficulty there
there's your corsair link so they're
using a custom PCB this is a very
customized memory module you can
actually see the traces have been used
and what that means is not that course
are shipped me a used kit but that
corsair actually you know bill believes
in testing their memory which is a very
nice and reassuring thing to see because
you know in this industry that's always
cost down costs down you still want to
know that there's premium products out
there that look so good I'm sure slicks
camera angles are almost as good as mine
you know with that we have to power
these on we have to see the lights so
we're in the dark ready to powered oh so
sexy
okay I'll take it I'm taking the camera
from slicky
sucks at it anyway so that's what they
look like when they're powered on in the
dark so beasts love it you can get
likened like an under glow effect around
the memory slots and all that as well so
you take that out anyway thank you for
