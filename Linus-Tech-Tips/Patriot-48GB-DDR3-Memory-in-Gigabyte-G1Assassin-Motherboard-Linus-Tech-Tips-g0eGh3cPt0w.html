discovery position of my line is tech
tips video blog and this is a pretty
interesting one I unboxed this recently
this is an 8 gig dim from Patriot and as
I mentioned when they sent me the this 8
gig dim they actually sent me six of
them and I told them that my intention
was to test it out in ah here we are
a 48 gig configuration so my test bench
here I'm just gonna go ahead and boot
this up let's find out if this is gonna
work now this is an old BIOS on this
board this is a d1 assassin
XL ATX motherboard I'm running a 990 X
Extreme Edition CPU I'm running dual GTX
590 s in this particular config and I've
got an SSD I've got a 12 50 watt power
supply this is a pretty badass machine I
haven't done any overclocking or
anything because I want to find out if
it's gonna work we posted now bear in
mind this is an old BIOS so this is
actually a launch BIOS on this board I
have never updated the BIOS on it so I
don't know if it's going to properly
recognize the 48 gigabytes of memory
that it has installed in it so let's
just bear with me guys here while the
system boots up let's see if there's
anything else I can say about it well
this memory is 1333 memory it runs at
timings of 9 9 9 24 it's designed for
the intel 6 series platform so really
patriots intention here in terms of what
they have tested is for you to be
running this in at most a 4 by 8 gig
configuration for 32 gigs looks like
we're in Windows let's see if it's all
recognized to you guys I haven't done
any configuration of the BIOS level so I
don't know what timings it's gonna be
running at it might auto - check this
out physical memory no AMD graphics
installed that's fine physical memory 49
gigs so this is so much memory is
actually like gone over the 48 and some
odd mark it's 49 gigs of memory and
let's see what kind of let's see what
kind of timings were running out here
let's open up prime95 here's what I'm
gonna do you guys I'm gonna run prime95
over the week
using 48 gigs of memory and I'm gonna
see if it's still running when I get
back so this is running at 1333 nine
nine nine twenty four just like that
without any configuration whatsoever and
I will post a video for you guys when
I'm back on back in the office on Monday
letting you know if this past a weekend
stability test running with 48 gigs of
RAM in the next 58 system pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
