have an idea actually to be specific I
have an idea it was definitely not your
idea okay I approved the idea which does
not mean it's right and I originally had
no definitely mine first anyway what we
can all agree on is that my idea of us
potentially starting another channel
with more of a focus on instead of
technology something else because you
guys have been asking I mean it's
probably their idea
more than anything yes they've been
asking us for this fruit like yeah um
okay I don't remember where we're going
with this anyway he wants a channel
that's more oriented towards gaming and
I want a channel that focuses on like
toys and collectibles and crap so what
we did is what I also want that I will
and I want a gaming channel too I guess
sort of things um so we created two
trailers for you guys or what do they
call pilots pilots - pilots for you guys
one where I take a toy that I bought and
I make sort of the older blog style
video and then when were you I don't
know what you did I played a game and I
did like a short review and it's it's
like a budget style thing so I found a
game that's on a really good sale that
is really good good for you alright so
without further ado guys you can watch
both of those videos we're gonna have
them here back-to-back and then when
you're done we want you to vote for how
you want us to proceed okay so this
thing showed up on mass drop I don't
know if it's technically a toy because
it's actually pretty dangerous if you
were to fire the bug assault into your
eye you would you would not be having a
good time so a first couple fun facts
about flies number one is flies poop
every four to five minutes number two is
they can carry diseases as innocuous as
well no they're all kind of terrible
including like leprosy and stuff so the
bug assault is the fly hunting insect
hunting I mean they claim the thing can
even kill stuff like roaches at close
range shot gun that fires well-salt so
let's
with what they have to say for
themselves here's something I haven't
done in a very long time uses ordinary
table salt this I can verify you can see
I have the top load it up with some
ordinary table salt which claims it can
do about 50 shots before reloading and
you can actually monitor the levels
right through that little viewfinder
right there alright no batteries
required no in fact there are no
batteries because the thing is powered
like this yeah that's right
spring-loaded love it and then you go
ahead and release that safety catch
right there on the side in order to have
it be ready to go alright so the trigger
itself is pretty self-explanatory once
you get that going if you don't release
the safety catch it simply will not fire
so I personally wouldn't mind having a
faster refire rate but I understand why
they did this because the salt comes out
at a rate that is fast enough to kill a
fly at about 3 feet or so they claim so
you know shooting your hand with it you
can see that actually left a scratched
up white mark on my hand like it
actually quite hurts if you're to
accidentally discharge this thing into
your eye or your mouth or whatever else
you might not go kurt cobain on it but
it wouldn't be comfortable that's for
sure alright so it has a pop-up sight
indicator does not splatter the fly this
is important because you don't want fly
guts all over the place although one
thing I noticed was I I had a I had here
let's let's go for a walk so I had a I
had a fly land in my wife's mixing bowl
and I was like oh cool I just got this
thing I'm gonna be all like boom right
into the mixing bowl unfortunately
mixing bowls are basically like a giant
fly halfpipe so I hit the fly probably
died it wasn't flying around anywhere
after that and I don't know where it
went so it's a complete fly somewhere
and it's a good thing it wasn't pieces
in fly because there was food nearby
because of you know mixing bowl and all
that so let's see if we can find some
bugs to hunt shall we
so our fly hunting expedition got cut a
little short I don't know if you can see
the police cruiser the officers behind
me but apparently for all the for all
the not looking like a gun nests of this
we walked only about three or four
blocks and someone called them so so
there you go guys we're going to have to
in
I'd go for our back-up plan which was a
sacrificial victim that I caught earlier
when I was testing the thing now before
I before we get to that I do want to
talk about the build quality of it a
little bit for what I paid on mass drop
it's actually built surprisingly well
like the mechanism has a good sound and
it actually feels as good as it sounds
the the weight of the unit is really
nice the the molded handle is quite
comfortable and then the trigger has a
very satisfying not too easy but not too
difficult to pull quality to it that
apparently convinced someone it's a real
gun also once you prime it this little
site here I'll just show you guys how it
works that site pops up and it's mad
it's accurate enough to use I'd say so
from testing it earlier you know what
three feet guys probably not a lot of
the time particularly outside where
winds a factor but inside your your
mileage may vary but from about a foot
and a half away yeah yeah I was able to
I was able to get a successful kill
earlier but wanted to here though is
actually alive so here I'll show you our
there's our victim fly so you can see
he's moving around in there little does
he know I feel like I'm like 10 right
now and honestly it was a very awkward
conversation with the cops there that
was like I was like super awkward
okay so we're only gonna have one crack
at this let's find out where he is
alright here we go
he goes the bug assault about a foot and
a half away boom and there you have it
the fly is intact as advertised maybe
not dead yet but certainly stunned to
the point where you won't be bothering
you or your mother or your sister
anymore and I guess that's all there is
to really say about it guys be careful
with it I think I've said don't shoot at
your eyes enough times but even from
kind of that distance it's got a bit of
like it's got a bit of a sting to it um
thanks for watching this video about the
bug assault original assault gun don't
forget to whatever it is I would do as
an outro for these videos we're not
really finished the concept yet check
this up here's some like horrible water
nope safety everytime there we go boom
actually that gives you a pretty good
pretty good idea of how much oof this
has - it's on the boat two and a half
feet away right now boom there you go so
it shoots they advertise a pinch of salt
no way you guys more than that so you
will make a bit of a mess if you're
firing this inside all the time this is
gonna hurt
fires about that much salt that is
that's a big pinch maybe you got like
meat fingers going on over there right
welcome to the bargain bin asterisk
temporary name we're not really sure yet
the game we're gonna be covering today
is trying to it is currently available
on both steam and Humble Bundle and I'm
sure a few other stores for about $2.99
and its predecessor trying one is
available for about $0.99 which is an
incredibly good price for this game this
game is a good solid single player to
player and three player co-op game where
you play three characters and that is
actually why it is such a good co-op
game because when you're playing
single-player you play all three
characters when you're playing
two-player co-op you still play all
three characters just with two people
and when you're three player co-op you
play all three of those characters
individually and you can swap in between
first up is Pontius the knight protector
of the realm and main compat until this
party of three he has some utility based
on his throwing hammer which he could
use to smash down things in the distance
or break down walls up close and you can
also utilize his shield to protect
himself and the party from projectiles
or anything else that might be flowing
in their direction next up is Zoya the
thief a personal favorite of mine she
uses a bow arrows and a grappling hook
that makes her seem like Spider Man to
traverse the map and her main utility is
actually her movement later on in the
game she gets a gravity field type
ability which allows you to move even
more easily along with her entire party
which is nice and Sheik is quite deadly
in combat as well last up is Emma - the
wizard his focus is on utility and his
utility is based around creating
geometrical shapes like boxes and planks
and then using those to manipulate the
environment he can create ramps for you
he can create tons of other things and
he can also use his telekinesis to move
things around so say there's something
in the environment that needs to be
moved he can do that even if it's too
heavy for one of the other characters or
you can move his own shapes he's also
not useless in combat though he can put
enemies in cages rendering them fairly
useless or he can literally just
pick them up and move them out of the
way of the battle while in the game
Bastian
the narrator makes you feel like you're
actually writing your own story and
trying to it makes it feel like you were
a part of a greater larger story and
that is punctuated by the fact that each
chapter load is based on literally
reading the lines off of the start of a
chapter in a book trying to suspend your
disbelief early enough on so that when
Pontius gallops over a Ledge it doesn't
seem unrealistic despite the fact that
he's wearing massive full plate mail and
has a massive hammer and shield and
stored with him as well it's believable
and it doesn't bother you because it
feels natural and expected easily one of
my most favorite things about this game
is that it's a puzzle game but there's
not one rigid solution that cannot
change as a solution to the problem
there's there's many you can be as crazy
as you want and I know that many times
throughout this game I am sure that we
were not doing what was intended to be
done to solve that problem but that's
okay that's actually celebrated to a
certain point so when you and your
friends are screwing around and the
wizard makes some weird contraption of
geometrical shapes and the warrior is
bouncing some weird light thing off
something else and the thief is swinging
it around like crazy if you guys do
happen to get through then you got
through and that's awesome it doesn't
force you into this very cookie cutter
way of doing things another thing that I
really like about the puzzles in this
game is that they're not all the same
you know that feeling when you're
playing Skyrim when you get to your
fourth quad or and you look on the
bottom of the claw and you're like okay
I get it or you get to any of your other
puzzles in Skyrim and it's just spinning
the thing to match the thing that you
can see somewhere else you're like okay
I get it you never really have that
feeling with trying to everything's
always different and I have to say that
about the expansion - I said expansion
you might be like there's no expansion
for trying - there's a DLC but I believe
it should honestly be called an
expansion the Goblin Menace is one of
the best DLCs I have ever downloaded and
actually feels like you're getting an
entirely new game if this was actually
titled trying three I wouldn't be too
surprised I would laugh and say that's
an expansion but I wouldn't be too
surprised with the modern state of the
gaming industry and DLC has a terrible
name so I'm going to call the Goblin
Menace and expansion trying to has been
criticized for its combat
although I question whether or not those
critics have actually played through the
game in its entirety or they were just
rushing through the game as fast as they
could on easy if you move the difficulty
up to medium or hard whatever is best
for you and actually play the combat as
if it was difficult it becomes much more
different when you start off the game it
starts as a hack-and-slash on any
difficulty but as you get a little bit
further in it becomes more complex the
enemies become more difficult and you
have more abilities if to utilize your
characters properly along with utilizing
your abilities properly and the
environment around you to actually
survive and this makes it much more fun
and also massively rewarding the combat
in this game is extremely malleable it
allows you to do whatever the heck you
want with it and it actually encourages
it if you want to be super aggressive
you can run around killing everyone or
if a goblin throws a spear and hits his
buddy and you back off they might fight
each other to the death that's the kind
of stuff that can happen in this game
it's very random and very open and I
love that part of it just like the
puzzles the combat in this game does not
feel cookie-cutter from physics skills
to just plain stabbing someone in the
face the combat can go from serious to
hilarious in a matter of seconds while
maintaining difficulty feeling natural
and without skipping a beat I can only
find a few cons in my entire playthrough
the first of which would be ability
balance I found late in the game with
the thief when you get the gravity arrow
things get a little wonky if you place
the arrow properly in certain areas you
can almost avoid entire puzzles and that
doesn't seem right although I do wonder
I'm not necessarily avoiding it this is
using mechanic to get around the puzzle
so is this just another way of solving
it like when you're playing the wizard
and you increase the amount of boxes you
can get sometimes you can stack a bunch
of boxes and get around a puzzle that
way maybe that's how it works but I
wasn't too enthralled by it
another thing is character balance the
knight doesn't seem very useful for
large portions of the game because the
game isn't 100% combat focused so in
some puzzles he just kind of sits there
but then later on in the game you unlock
certain things like throwing his hammer
which makes them a little bit more
useful but at the same time the thief
has an explosive arrow I don't know in
the in the goblin minutes expansion he
does become a lot more useful because
there's more combat also there's a few
things that the explosive arrow don't
seem to do anything to while throwing
his hand
does affect it another thing is that
while you can play the game in co-op
playing in single-player although it is
a very similar experience with the same
amount of characters is very different
in multiplayer you have to construct
contraptions and whatnot to get through
different puzzles but you have to get
everyone through in single-player you
only have to get one person through
because when you switch characters you
stay in the same spot getting one person
through can sometimes be a lot easier or
a lot harder than getting all three
people through and that makes it very
interesting for platform compatibility
it works on basically everything except
for next-gen consoles so it works on
Linux Mac PC PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
it's three dollars like I said earlier
its predecessor trying one is about
$0.99 and I know you can get to multi
packs on Steam for about 4 or 5 bucks so
you can play with all your friends and
that's great
thanks for watching this video like and
dislike this video as normal favorite
and share to help out because this is a
new channel and as always please
subscribe Oh wasn't that great thanks
for watching guys so we have a poll for
you guys it's going to be linked in the
video description and there will be four
options which I forget there's there's a
gaming channel toys channel gaming and
toys channel or no channel rolled into
one you know gay likes that option so
like one channel that's called like you
know you did the ball pit that's not a
terrible name actually it's not that's
really not yeah you spent so much time
trying to find in me and we hadn't
unlike anything that's probably taken
probably but we could fight like using
that idea we yeah we could probably come
up with something so like like you know
toys and games or you can just say okay
look you guys I love what you do with
the technology but you're trying too
hard on this other stuff you guys just
suck and we're okay with that too you
know cute it's unfortunately we don't
come you're not great but it's
acceptable I guess anyway I think we're
done here guys let us know what you
think please do vote it means a lot to
us and it will it will have a lot to do
with direction we go in the future in
terms of bringing
guys more more fun entertaining content
and don't worry the tech videos aren't
going anywhere yeah we didn't do it like
subscribe and what nothing whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
