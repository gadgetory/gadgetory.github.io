video initially I mean a desk is a very
subjective thing and whether you like
one or not can depend on a wide variety
of different factors is it aesthetically
pleasing to you are its features
beneficial to you on a day-to-day basis
is the bloody thing even comfortable to
use these are all questions that can
only be answered individually
fortunately I have an entire team of
people that have been using power up and
squared up motorized up desks as their
daily drivers since anthology creative
was kind enough to provide us with
enough for my editors and hardware
testing team so the plan is to mix in
some of their impressions with my own
and present them as a group so here we
go
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more I'm not a fan
of covering products that make claims
about improving your health while you do
absolutely nothing to change your
lifestyle and the offers that I've
received to review things like the a
burner mm or whatever go straight in the
e mail junk bin where they belong
standing desks are a little bit
different number one they don't claim
that you won't have to do anything they
acknowledge up front that you will have
to get off your butt and stand up number
two I'll lean on the Mayo Clinic
specifically here but they're not the
only reputable source of this
information sitting for long periods of
time has been linked remember this means
correlation not causation and they're
not the same thing to a fairly wide
variety of health concerns including
obesity increased blood pressure high
blood sugar abnormal cholesterol levels
and even cardiovascular disease and
three it is also well established at
this point that doing pretty much
anything but sitting helps so while the
best thing to do is move around even at
a leisurely pace periodically throughout
the day pacing while on the phone is a
good habit to get into
if you must be at your desk constantly
then standing up is better than nothing
so with that out of the way let's take a
tour of the up desk mine is the series 3
power up in the large size to
accommodate my ultrawide monitor and
aquarium PC but there are a variety of
sizes and finishes with medium being the
best choice for most people something I
guess anthology creative knows since
it's the only available size and some of
the funky non-standard top colors not
that I'm bitter I couldn't get the
purple polka-dotted one okay maybe I am
a little bitter so moving around to the
top we find the regrettably plain black
top that is well it's plain and black
I'm honestly not really sure what to say
about this but it's one and a quarter
inches thick and has a nicely finished
laminate surface the only really notable
thing about the top surface is the
gently curved user side this is
something I and
most of my team like I put my laptop to
my left and stuff I need within reach to
my right but that teryn wishes was
straight since the recess puts him a
little closer to his monitors than he'd
like unfortunately up desk doesn't have
anything perfectly rectangular or a
little bit deeper the good news here is
that if you really wanted to swap out
the tabletop it would be as simple as
finding a surface you like and screwing
everything else into it the input module
that handles up/down saving and
recalling your three preset Heights and
displaying the current height in inches
is the only thing that would likely need
to move and the cable it comes with is
long enough that it should work with any
tabletop
that's under the 375 pound capacity of
the base unit anyway since we're down
here this is probably a good time to
look at the rest of the underbelly of
this beast
I've done some custom cable management
here the USB power hub AC power strip
and a power brick for my monitor and
laptop were added
but the J channel management runs come
with the desk as does the large power
input and controller module in the
middle this piece takes input from the
user
and drives the motors that each
telescoping support leg is equipped with
this implementation of the motors is
aside from the ability to save and
recall height presets the biggest
difference for me between the up desk
and the less expensive Verte desks that
we've used in the past not only is the
action smoother and quieter but the legs
themselves are much less wobbly in spite
of the heavier load of the stock
tabletop and because they don't have a
drive shaft that connects to both sides
with a motor in the middle the assembly
process is much simpler you can actually
see here how long it took for me to
assemble a vert desk compared to about
half an hour for an up desk not to
mention that the shaft is impossible to
pop out on its own requiring about an
hour for me and Luke to figure out
what's going on and repair it
true story hashtag blame Brandon on the
subject of wobbliness there's zero that
I can perceive at my sitting height but
at my standing height I did not notice
it while using the mouse and using
keyboard shortcuts but I did
notice it while typing I can say that
I'm using an extremely heavy monitor
which does exacerbate the issue of
monitor wobble so it's got that going
for it but it was there one thing I
can't make any excuses for though is the
Android app to remind you to sit down
and stand up at regular intervals
frankly it's terrible the basic
functionality actually works but non
tech savvy users like my mom would get
instantly frustrated by tapping on a
field having it bring up a value
selector and then just not filling the
field out even though it did actually
end up working once I got it configured
even though I was flying blind
apparently the iOS one is better but I'm
not on the iPhone right now and I didn't
use it
anyway since there are many third-party
stand up or break reminder applications
out there including ones that run on
your PC so I don't have to be bothered
about it when I'm not actually even at
my computer anyway so conclusion time if
the point is to achieve the health
benefits of standing then there are
definitely cheaper fully motorized desk
options like the vert desk but I have
first-hand experience with and the IKEA
bacon tour beckoned or however they
pronounce that means friend apparently
that I unfortunately do not and there
are even bolt-on like workstation
jobbies from companies like Peugeot Tron
and Anthology creative themselves but
the solid build quality extremely wide
range of movement that allows everyone
from me to look to adjust to the perfect
working height regardless of our body
proportions and the added creature
comfort of being able to pre-program
Heights has made us extremely happy with
these ones they can apparently even
accommodate a treadmill under them if
you're into that sort of thing but I'm
hoping that my staff will be happy
enough that they have standing desks and
enough space in the middle of the room
to stash their chairs and won't ask for
that yet for now speaking of things that
might make sense to ask for what about a
mobile carrier that you could pick up a
phone and call and there would actually
be okay this is like someone else having
a phone on and I know phones don't look
like this anyway anyway the point is
ting
dot-com you pick them up you don't talk
to a robot you get put through directly
to a person you pay only for what you
use with the average ting bill coming in
at about $24 a month per device and if
you're stuck in a contract and switch to
ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 and you might
be saying hold on a second lens you mean
the average bill is approximately dead
well you pay only for what you use so
head over to Linus ENCOM and use their
savings calculator to find out how much
you would likely pay so you basically
put in your last few bills and then you
enter how much you used your stuff and
then it goes oh well you know hey you're
actually a pretty light user you're
using a plan that doesn't make any sense
for you why don't you pay for just what
you use you have some concept it's
coming back again so it basically goes
yep you'd be a good ting candidate or
well you wouldn't they're completely
upfront about it and when you sign up at
our link that's Linus teen.com you'll
also get $25 an either service credit or
towards a new device so check it out now
