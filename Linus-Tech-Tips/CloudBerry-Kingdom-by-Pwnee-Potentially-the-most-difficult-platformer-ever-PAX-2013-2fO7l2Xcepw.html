brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series hey guys this is a game
I knew about before I got two packs and
wasn't sure that they were going to be
here but once I luckily walked past
across their booth I had to check it out
this is cloudberry Kingdom in all of its
insanity this game is known for the
incredible amounts of difficulty and I
was wondering what else you could add to
this picture well it's randomly
generated 2d platformer so every time
you play a level it's completely
brand-new you'll never see it again
unless you choose to save it which is
another story really so it's just an
awesome platformer with infinite levels
so infinite replayability you can never
get bored of it that's a really good way
of saying it randomly puts randomly
generated levels in a platformer is a
really interesting idea but I think you
guys pulled it off pretty well now the
thing I brought up earlier about
difficulty can you expand more on that
how you can push it to the limit sure we
spent about two years creating an AI
that's able to design these levels and
throughout the process we realize that
we can really crank this up so what's
great about Rai is flexibility I mean
you can create some of the easiest
levels you've seen in your life I mean
you know like a five-year-old can play
it versus you know you can crank it up
to like some super I don't know like if
Bruce Lee was a gamer he could do it
yeah something I mean so it's really
flexible in terms of what it can do and
it can be the easiest thing you've ever
seen or the hardest thing you've ever
seen that's awesome because when you can
crank up the ability to the ability not
that that when you can hang up the
difficulty to that level you can get
some pretty awesome playthroughs I've
already seen some videos recorded on
YouTube of people beating certain levels
and it's just nuts it's fun to see that
with this amount of AI building levels I
already know the answer this but is it
possible for them to make one that's
actually impossible it is possible to
make it impossible but when that happens
the computer automatically deletes the
level every level that you will actually
experience within the game is provable
by the computer and if you don't believe
it you actually you can buy a powerup in
the game it's five coins whatever it is
and you can just watch the computer run
through the level for you just as proof
there you go so if you're getting really
pissed off because you can't beat a
level it is your
fault it is not the game's fault how do
you get these gold coins you speak up oh
they're just strewn throughout the level
you can just take a look there they're
these blue gems and there's like
anywhere from 12 to 20 per level cool so
you can you can basically just gather
these things and then it can show you
how to go through levels so you can beat
them more easily if you're stuck yeah
exactly we have three different
power-ups that you can use by spending
those coins you collect there's watch
the computer play it there's a second
one that shows a dotted line path
through that is the best path through
and the third one is slow motion where
you play at half speed okay that half
speed one sounds a little bit powerful
anymore you can add about the game is
their story line there anything actually
going on why is he going through these
levels sure we've got three main modes
to the game there's there's a story mode
which you know it feels like every
platformer it needs it it absolutely
needs it the generic the general story
of the game is that Bob is very similar
to a classic platform hero that we know
of except a more realistic take on you
know he's been rescuing the princess
over and over and over and he's he's
sick of it and you can see that it's
clearly jaded doesn't want to be here
but he's just kind of going through the
motions and then we got arcade mode was
a more competitive experience it's you
know it's we're going for high scores
and we have online leaderboards for that
and we've got a free play mode where it
lets you tinker with the levels
personally you get to adjust every
variable that the AI uses to create your
own levels now previously you said you
could save levels can you can you create
these levels save them and then give
them to someone else when he checks yes
on the on the pc when you save a level
it'll give you a seed that you can save
and share with your friends perfect
that's great now the arcade mode that
you're mentioning is what i'm expecting
most people are really going to be doing
probably play through the sigma player i
get used to it play their arcade mode so
that's really cool that you included
that I like the leaderboards alike all
that kind of stuff how would someone go
about acquiring this game you can
acquire this game through xbox live
arcade playstation network wii u eshop
or steam wow that's a lot of different
platforms
flexible that makes sense that's good
