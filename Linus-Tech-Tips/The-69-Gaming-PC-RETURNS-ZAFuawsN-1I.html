concerned with 4k 120 Hertz and more
concerned with running any games at all
then this video is for you
Riley here who's actually going to be
doing some more work here on the LTTE
channel moving forward was given the
task of taking our previous $69 gaming
PC which frankly was barely deserving of
the title PC let alone gaming and taking
it out behind the shed and putting a
bullet in its head
oh that's violence and looky what he
found on eBay a full PC for get this $27
us 27 bucks and can it games actually
yeah kind of and we're gonna show you
guys how after this message from glass
wire glass wire allows you to instantly
see your current and past network
activity detect malware and block badly
behaving apps on your PC or Android
device use offer code linus to get 25%
off at the link below
we always say that when you set out to
build a PC the most important
consideration is what you intend to use
it for that's how you avoid spending too
much or cheeping out and hurting the
experience so then knowing that we
weren't gonna be running shadow of the
Tomb Raider with r-tx on we set out with
what we hoped would be a reasonable goal
running casual and eSports games like
minecraft League of Legends dota 2 and
csgo with overwatch for extra credit so
do you want to run me through so this is
a Dell Optiplex 380 beautiful machine
it's got an Intel Core 2 Duo 7500 in it
four gigs of ddr3 RAM and a 160 gig hard
drive at 7200 RPM beautiful it didn't
come with Windows 10 and a parallel port
oh yeah oh yeah you need one of those oh
yeah there but no oh yeah buddy drivers
for everything $27 27 bucks yeah dang
plus shipping right put shipping with
free shipping $37 so ok ok in fairness
to us though if we were in the US
shipping would have been way cheaper
yeah oh it actually booted up Oh see
here's another quirk do you have to do
it there no here's another quick you
have to plug the USB the mouse into a
different USB port oh and then it wears
beautiful wonderful okay now op duplexes
are more geared towards the corporate or
education markets so while they do tend
to have decent networking this guy's got
gigabit which is nice to have and
reliable components they lack some of
the features that you would normally
find in a gaming rig like a graphics
card there is nary a graphics card to be
found which isn't to say though that we
aren't gonna try to run games on it
straight out of the box so what you got
there I have a crash message yeah
Oh beautiful so beautiful - you've got
match I got two in SLI yep even though
we did find drivers for everything that
doesn't mean that they're perfect
none of the games we tried to launch
managed to successfully open and among
other probable issues we did discover
that the g41 Express chipset which is
this little high-tech beauty right here
doesn't support OpenGL on Windows 10 now
with that said I mean what kind of
performance were we expecting not very
good I just wanted to know you know I
wanted to believe in something
so anyway it's time to move on to our
real plan which is installing a graphics
card right which you didn't though
there's a PCI Express slot here it's
probably gonna be a little bit trickier
than you might think yeah the only
graphics cards that actually fit in the
case have to be a low profile and single
PCIe slot card so you're gonna have a
hard time finding a modern any kind of
relatively modern card that fits that
description so check this out this was
back in the era when Intel was still
trying to flip the ATX standard upside
down so you notice this opens on the
opposite side panel that most modern
cases do so a graphics card that you put
here doesn't take up this next PCI slot
it'll interfere with the CPU heatsink
the parallel port potentially some of
these capacitors like it's just it's
kind of a mess unless you get a little
creative now our target graphics card
for a system of this caliber would be
something like a GeForce GTX 650 which
you can find on eBay for anywhere from
30 to 50 bucks bringing the total cost
for this machine right in line with our
target plus shipping problem is that is
not a single slot nor is it a
low-profile card now what we could do is
Dremel out this part of the case right
here which which would allow us to get
it to fit in there but it's a little
easier if you just use a PCI Express
extender it'll only cost you about five
bucks you won't get like a fancy
shielded one like this or five bucks but
you could get something functional so oh
it does fit all the way in PCI extender
in card into the other end
we'll just kind of sit it in there and
this system has come it come and look at
this has literally no extra power
connectors other than a floppy power
connector which we could actually like
cut off and strip and then like solder
on to yeah that's that's probably not a
great idea and we think we've got a
better solution anyway because who needs
an optical drive anywho let's check this
out would you look at that a SATA 2 PCI
Express power adapter it can fit you
just got believe Linus BAM Wow there we
go building pcs is fun so that's it we
can fire it up now right yes it's
powered it's plugged in yep okay and
we've got DVI output now and we
installed everything with the power cord
connected that's fine oh yeah we
probably should have done that wow that
is a dusty gross card yeah Wow look at
that
just boots up fine drivers installed and
everything it's like we've done this
before some things it's almost like we
prepare these videos anyways moving on
so once the once you once you've roused
the system from its deep sleep and now
we can safely attempt to play some games
I'd say all right play csgo see us going
look that was actually pretty quick yeah
I'm going to go with BOTS don't don't
subject other people yeah so what do we
what settings are we running out here
not a 720 720 720 low 720 low limbo low
we're going right under this computer is
it going that's where's he going really
impressive ah I'm stuck are you it's do
you need cheese Louise Oh were you using
the table to cheat No
yeah so we're still running at about 50
60 FPS that's actually not too shabby
yeah oh no yeah see you will get some
framedrops yes because with my could
escape you you're gonna kill them with
our poker name yeah I just I want to see
what happens to our frame rate when we
walk through the smoke okay Hardison we
saw an initial dip down to Lake 30 it's
staying in the 3540 range I mean it's
usable it's usable yes okay let's stop
playing there okay
so yeah okay pretty good all right well
that's fun
oh you're oh you're gonna play with real
people your teammates well against AI
that's how you do it or do you want to
play just training
no fine well they don't have to deal
with this yeah yeah we do well they just
have to deal with that we're gonna lag
out I don't know I was getting pretty
good pain no but we're gonna close the
game yeah yeah yeah
where's the gun girl cambian Ezreal so
does everyone else have to wait for our
epic hard drive to to manage to load it
yes hey we're not the slowest are we not
check this out this guy's at 40% Master
Yi over here dang dude Hey here we go
Wow like 90 100 FPS look at those
graphics not bad
is this even 720p this looks like today
actually you have no idea what settings
this is that this looks pretty good
hold on a minute can I just I'm how am I
gonna kill around in here I'm gonna kill
we're running it 1080 medium high Wow
Oh bad guys for 70 blocks for 70 bucks
yeah you can play one of the top games
in the world no problem I mean can you
even get like like can you even get like
an old gameboy color on eBay for 70
bucks like that's kind of what I'm
talking about here like that's true
we're gaming for 70 bucks
we haven't been killing anybody that's
like yeah we should probably get on that
boom boom hey let's watch this though
watch this cool yeah that didn't even
even with a bunch of action going on
here we haven't dipped below 55 okay I
think we've probably had enough yes at
this point okay
minecraft I should run on a potato but
confess I don't know how to play
minecraft oh okay okay okay there's a
force can we go get the horse
let's get him that's a cow well I didn't
say what I said get it I didn't say kill
it
you said get it you're a monster what
does get it mean enough
what's wrong with you what if all you
were trying to do was harvest kelp and
smack fish in the face which I have done
successfully picked up some kelp I mean
that's pretty playable but watch this
lioness I guess you didn't see this
coming
let's go down to six chunks minecraft
has a lot to do with chunks okay if you
don't know your chunks in Minecraft
you're gonna be in trouble
thank you so it's just a little bit of
tuning there Minecraft 200 plus FPS yeah
I was like compulsively playing
overwatch for a little bit okay is this
gonna get you back on me uh yeah maybe I
think I'm gonna make it to Championships
here tonight this year this is gonna
take you all the way
well I thought it just turned off the
ground did you do the graphics card is
just loose in there oh my gosh oh yeah
there's a missing plate try that
dressing blade that'll do it you know
what I bet if we ripped off one more
blade that wobble would go away let's
maybe not do that right now right but
then it would wobble anymore so we're at
720 60 vsync off everything most most
everything off well low low low low low
let's do mr. heroes is there actually a
delay when I shoot or like is that just
an animation or what like what do you
mean oh you I have to leave the target
yeah you do
oh crap well that wasn't working I can't
see if you press through whoa oh no
you're dead no I'm not dead it's over
now it's not over now yeah when you see
when you see me it's over oh yeah
jump - for your life did I get one I got
one I got one
oh I didn't get a kill yeah I got an
assist okay what's this what do I do
your zenyatta now now you're a robot
telling me the name of the character and
like what type of brain they are press e
when you see them shift is like a left
click back here I've had enough of this
this is a bad this is a bad experience
bad overwatch code bad experience and
you're the worst overwatch okay wait so
the frame rates forgetting aren't gonna
blow anyone away especially as we get
two morons newer more demanding titles
and we're basically limited to 720p and
in many cases low details if we want
things to run smoothly but like if
you're a high school student or
something this can be had for less than
a hundred bucks if you get like a gray
market Windows 10 key or you can
otherwise get one on the cheap so you
I mean you throw some emulators and
stuff on here and this is a pretty
freakin adequate experience adequate is
the right word to use yeah there are a
few things we could do on the cheap to
make it a lot better like an SSD would
be a great upgrade and all you'd really
need is an extra SATA cable since there
is an extra port on a motherboard but
you would need a SATA power splitter to
do that yeah just make sure that if
you're splitting one of the SATA power
connectors you split the one that's
going to the hard drive now as opposed
to splitting the one that's going to
your graphics card even if your graphics
card isn't super demanding we're we're
still kind of adapting power cables
which isn't necessarily the best thing
yeah and if that's not enough you could
still throw in eight gigs of ram and a
750ti or a 950 which might even get you
playable frame rates at 1080p because
again we were at 720p at low you might
end up cpu bottlenecks though
fortunately though this motherboard
should be compatible with cheap quad
core 775 processors like the Q 6600
which you can get for as little as five
or ten bucks or even free in just like a
bargain bin in some case and you can
throw that day be under there this
cooler I'll handle it
just fine
and even if you made all of those
upgrades you'd still be in the like $200
neighborhoods so all in all a pleasantly
surprising end result and while I can't
say that you guys will have an identical
experience because buying used hardware
on eBay is always a bit of a gamble
there's also no reason to think that you
couldn't build something similar i mean
hey if riley someone who isn't qualified
to review the RT x 2080 can do it so can
you
great work Riley oh you know what's not
a laughing matter our sponsor ting ting
