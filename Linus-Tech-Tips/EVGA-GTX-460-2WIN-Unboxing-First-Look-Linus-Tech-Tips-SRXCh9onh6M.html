the GeForce GTX 460 to win or twin from
EVGA this is something I've received
numerous requests to take a look at and
to evaluate the performance of so I'm
going to be doing one of those things
today and I will be taking a look at it
I will not be evaluating the performance
because I can tell you guys right now
before I've even opened the box how it
will perform and I think the performance
should be fairly evident based on the
name of the product in this case so what
this is is it is a custom PCB product
from EVGA who is if you are to believe
what it says on the side of their box
and I do the number one seller in the
u.s. of Nvidia based products number one
and reliability and service of graphics
cards something-something footnote
number one performance leader in 3d mark
11 and the number one folding at home
team in the world let's open this baby
up see what we get in terms of
accessories so the first thing we have
is a graphics card user guide the next
thing we find is a driver CD with a
sticker so you can use the sticker but
throw away the driver CD download the
latest drivers from Nvidia calm this is
a sticker it appears to be a bumper
sticker that's kind of sweet throw that
on your car why not right alright next
we have a mini HDMI to HDMI cable and
that's a nice long cable so you don't
have to worry about any clearance issues
when you're plugging in the full size
HDMI cable we've got two dual six pin
two single eight pin PCIe power
connectors as well as a DVI to VGA
adapter the next thing we find is the
tool or a twin card itself which has a
custom cooler custom PCB this is just
about as customer card as you can hope
to encounter so let's
open this up and let's talk about
performance there for a little bit so
performance the GeForce GTX 460 twin
well the performance will be exactly the
performance of two GTX 460 s in SLI or
with pretty much within margin of error
of such a solution because this is a
dual GPU graphics card so on this fully
custom PCB you can see we have three
eighty millimeter fans and those are all
blowing into a fairly custom heat pipe
cooler so you can see each of the GPUs
has three heat pipes so on this top one
you can see three heat pipes coming out
this way this way and this way
this middle one is actually only cooling
heat valve will be carrying away heat
that is brought to it from the heat
pipes from the other GPUs as well as
blowing down onto the PCB to cool any
other incidental components and then
here the other GPU has three heat pipes
coming out of it this way so carrying
heat away from those GTX 460 GPUs or gf1
tens I believe they are alright so this
is not restrictive at all so these fans
are going to have full access to the
airflow they need to blow air onto the
heat pipes and fins here this is a
really cool thing about this card
because it is an SLI on a card card
we actually have full support for three
displays out in 3d vision surround so
one of these sets of displays is running
off one of the cards the other two
displays are running off of the other
card or chip or whatever you want to
call it so we have full support for
technology that is typically only
possible with nvidia sli so here we see
a little bit of the overall design of
the card so you can see where the GPUs
are situated you can see this is 512
Meg's of RAM so the other 512 Meg's is
you know likelihood and I'm just gonna
double check that before I go ahead and
confirm it yep it is on the other side
of the PCB here is all of our power
delivery circuitry which is incidentally
powered by the two 8 pin PCIe connectors
on the top of the card here's where the
other GPU is as well as the
around it and the rest of the room is on
the other side you can see here that we
are using a PCIe 16x interface to
communicate with the computer and up
here we've actually got an SLI bridge
finger this doesn't work because the of
the limitations of the GAF 110 GPU
itself it is not capable of four-way SLI
it is only capable of 2-way SLI which we
are already running because we're
running a salon a card so we can't use
this that is just an error shouldn't be
there okay here we've got two 8-pin PCIe
power connectors which I mentioned
before they are situated in their ideal
locations on the top of the board
because if you extended this board any
longer then it might not fit into some
cases we've got an EVGA logo up here at
the top which matches the color scheme
of the rest of the card which looks
really sharp I might add and then other
than that
let's move around to the back of the
card and have a look at what's there not
a whole lot okay let's look at the
bottom of the card not a whole lot nice
brushed finish to the cooler though it
looks really really sharp and I just
want to do a quick size comparison for
you guys I'm just gonna run and grab GTX
let's see let's get it let's get an EVGA
GTX 580 and that's all I really have on
me right now I think
oh no hold on I have here I have a
Radeon 6990 so why don't we compare the
size really quickly to these other cards
so remember the GTX 460 because it's
such a good value GPU as soon as you put
it in sli it actually outperforms a GTX
580 even though the twin is a less
expensive solution than a GTX 580 power
consumption is also excellent on the GTX
460 so that is that's what makes this
card such a compelling solution that's
why EVGA went out of their way to
produce a custom card just for GTX 460
sli so here's the length compared to the
Radeon 6990 you can see it is a touch
shorter about 1/2 now about us
centimeter and a bit shorter and
requires the same number of PCIe 8-pin
connectors although I can guarantee you
this dual GTX 460 card consumes far less
power than the 6990 thank you for
