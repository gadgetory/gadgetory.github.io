and dirty unboxing of one of my
Christmas presents which is a corsair
flash voyager 8 gig drive I mean you can
never have enough USB thumb drives is my
mentality pretty much and the flash
voyager is a pretty good little drive
it's got a ruggedized rubber sheeting
that goes all around it to protect it
should you drop it or step on it or do
whatever else it is you need to do to it
so basically what Corsair says about it
is that it is durable shockproof plug
and play windows compatible and carries
a 10 year limited warranty so like so
many of course there's products the
warranty is what really sets it apart
from you know buying a generic one off
the shelf at whatever big box store okay
so let's just get this open from the
bottom here and we'll just have a quick
look this won't take long I promise the
flash voyager is available in a bunch of
different sizes i think throughout the
lifecycle of this product it's been
anywhere from i think like 64 Meg's and
now it goes up to about 64 gigs so you
can see that it has kind of like a green
rubberized grip e-business at on either
side here this is an activity LED that
shows you if you are using it and it has
data transferring this key ring I'm not
sure how much I like this because you
can see there's no structure inside it
it's actually just rubber and I've run
into a bit of an issue with my corsair
survive or drive where the the key hook
is not durable enough and it's actually
starting to come off they've got a link
here to corsair Memory calm and you can
see removing the cap is actually not
that easy so unless you're using it just
excessively taking the cap off and
putting it back on it should maintain
its grip eNOS on the USB contact itself
and you shouldn't have too much trouble
with losing the cap but something to be
aware of is that if you contact Corsair
and let them know you lost your cap they
will send you a replacement cap that is
their policy so there's your USB
interface itself and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Corsair
flash voyager</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
