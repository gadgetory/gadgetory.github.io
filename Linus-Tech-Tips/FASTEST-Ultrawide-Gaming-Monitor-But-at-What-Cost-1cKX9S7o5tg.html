monitors over three years ago but it's
taken them until now to offer a fully
fleshed-out product line catering to
gamers introducing the three for you c89
G - B that's not just me make fun of
other brands for like republic of gamers
anything is better than three for you
c89 G - B anyway it's their first ultra
wide to offer G sink and a high refresh
rate we're talking 144 Hertz
overclockable up to 166 Hertz but is it
worth your money only one way to find
out
savage jerky is created without the use
of nitrates or preservatives use offer
code LTT to save 10% through the link in
the video description the angular
crimson streaks and kind of says it all
this monitor is for gamers with a
capital G it's got about 5 inches of
height adjust 25 degrees of tilt and
like many LG stands no swivel it does
give you three degrees of rotation
though in case your jerks co-workers
decide to troll you so that's something
the refreshingly easy to access IO panel
has just one HDMI 1.4 in one DisplayPort
1.2 in and an audio jack then we get a
USB type B upstream port to power the
integrated hub with 2 USB 3 type-a ports
with fast charging it apparently also
has an integrated Mouse bungee that
helps your organize your space a claim
that I'd be happy to validate for you if
only our unit actually came with it the
IPS panel is really nice filled with
accurate colors great coverage of the
srgb color gamut and high contrast with
higher-than-average 300 nits brightness
you could do some basic content creation
on this thing for your let's play videos
for example but what's it like to game
on it well in a word suite
as with all curved ultra lines the
expanded field of view offers not only a
higher degree of immersion but sometimes
even an advantage in games where
spotting an enemy or an objective half a
second before the competition can make a
difference the 5 millisecond grade of
grey response times minimize ghosting
and for everyone running Nvidia graphics
g-sync
keeps the panels refresh rate tuned to
the FPS coming out of your graphics card
to eliminate tearing and stuttering and
finally yes the monitor runs at a
hundred and forty-four Hertz
meaning the image on screen refreshes a
hundred and forty four times per second
44 percent higher than the fastest ultra
wide that we've had in the lab
previously and it's even overclockable
to a hundred and sixty six Hertz though
your mileage may vary every individual
panel overclocks a little bit
differently and ours wasn't a
spectacular overclocker
now sixteen by nine monitors are
available with refresh rates of up to
240 Hertz at this point but unless
you're global elite or some BS the odds
of feeling a difference between 144
Hertz and 240 Hertz versus the night and
day difference between sixty Hertz or
even 100 Hertz and 144 is relatively
slim so with this product you're not
choosing between smoother onscreen
animations and ultra wide immersiveness
you can have both which doesn't mean
that it's without compromises I have a
confession to make I was super pumped
for this monitor to arrive because for
whatever reason I thought it was running
34 40 by 1440 resolution at 166 Hertz
which would have meant that it was using
the shiny new DisplayPort
1.4 standard and yes that is what
excites me I've got no shame about that
so then when I arrived and it was 2560
by 1080 I went through all the stages of
grief denial no no it can't be
guilt maybe I saw 144 Hertz I thought
1440p Oh God
and even anger they've had 1440 peals or
wives for years why are we going
backwards until finally I reached
acceptance because depending on who you
ask
the lower res could be considered as
much a feature as it is a problem a
lower resolution makes it easier to get
higher frame rates in games at 1080p
ultra wide is just over half the number
of pixels of a 1440p ultra wide so if
you're not going to be able to play doom
at 150 frames per second 34 40 by 1440
resolution then why pay for
all of those pixels better to drop the
resolution increase your graphic
settings and enjoy your buttery smooth
golden river of frames so then with that
said should you buy this monitor over
say the Acer predator X 30 for a
similarly priced similarly featured and
that they both have g-sync and IPS
panels ultra wide with a higher
resolution but a slower refresh rate
that depends if you're all about the
games especially fast paced ones then
it's pretty easy to recommend this one
ultra wide is an awesome experience but
if you do a lot of anything else in my
opinion 1080p at this size is pretty
pixely looking and I'll personally still
be waiting excitedly for these features
in a higher resolution model Dollar

shave you can get high quality blades
