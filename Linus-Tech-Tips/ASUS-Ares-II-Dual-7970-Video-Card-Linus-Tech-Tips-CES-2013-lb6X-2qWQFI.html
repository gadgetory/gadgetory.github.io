nine-thousaaaand actually no it's it's
one thousand only and it is the Ares two
from Asus if you've been paying any
attention to extremely high-end GPUs
extremely limited edition GPUs and
extremely fast GPUs over the last few
years you'll have heard of the Mars the
Mars 2 and the Ares which were the
previous super uber flagship cards from
a suit
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate Technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
now this one differentiates itself from
the others in a couple of key ways we're
familiar with seeing two top tier GPUs
on one card okay so this is 270 970
gigahertz addition cards that are fully
unlocked and you can do whatever you
want with them you want to tweak your
voltages you want to tweak your fan
speeds you want to do whatever you want
you go ahead and do that
awesome awesome stuff okay what we
haven't seen before
is one of these cards that check this
out see this case has nine expansion
slots but that is totally a 10/10 really
oh yeah okay has ten expansion slots but
you don't actually need that this is
only a two slot card eight PCI eight pin
or five AP says three eight pin PCI
Express power connectors liquid cooling
so we have a double thick radiator here
that's running in push-pull that has the
fans controlled by the GPU itself asus
has completely redesigned the digital
VRM okay so they've completely
redesigned the viren they have
completely redesigned the PCB there is
nothing bones talked about this 279 70s
are under there cooled by the liquid in
these tubes the air cooling fan there so
there's an 80 millimeter downdraft fan
there that is blowing air into this
gorgeous heatsink I mean that's one of
the other things about Republic of
gamers stuff is you put it in your
system and it feels like a status symbol
you got your lighting effects here you
got your gorgeous asu's symbol here so
that 80 millimeter fan down there is
actually get this dedicated to cooling
the PCB the memory and the vrn so that's
as much cooling as you'd see on a GTX
690 basically and it's not even cooling
the GPUs at all because it's a soos and
because we're just gonna do it that way
I'm so so so there you go they've also
got a full backplate on the card
so it looks absolutely gorgeous you got
your brushed aluminum finish on there
now the question you might have about
this guy's is how do I get one and the
answer right now is I have no idea and
the other question you might have is if
I get one how will I know that it's a
unique piece of video card art and the
answer is that there will be a laser
inscribed serial number on the card
itself yours will be a one-of-a-kind
this is the fastest card in the dual GPU
card in the world I mean
I think that pretty much makes it the
fastest card in the world it is also
fully as I said overclocking ready so
even though their gigahertz Edition
cards you can maybe you can get another
50 hundred megahertz maybe a little more
hundred some somewhere in that range
because it is liquid cool and so bright
so at stock it's already faster than a
reference 690 and guys remember that a
reference 690 actually doesn't overclock
that well compared to what you're gonna
be able to do with a republic of gamers
edition card I want you to come around
here and have a look at the back if
you're gonna have six gigs of ram and if
you're gonna have dual 7970 gigahertz
GPUs you might as well get up to five or
six monitors so there's a switchable
bios switch so you can either do five
display Eyefinity or six display
Eyefinity off of a single card that runs
in two slots
heaven forbid anyone put four of these
cards in a system not that I'm actually
suggesting you do that because you'd
have to rewire your house for the for
the power that you'd have to deliver to
that PC but if anyone does do it please
do send me a send me a message on the
Linus tech tips comm forum and I would
love to I'd love to fly out there and
have a look at that system just for the
sake of like just touching it but this
is a pretty unique system we got some
HyperX beasts in here we got some
coolant water cooling going on but more
than anything else that video card is a
centerpiece and yeah it goes really well
with Republic of gamers components so
we've got an ROG motherboard in there
we've got their Rader storage card which
we did a separate video about and I
can't give you any details about
whatsoever and I think that pretty much
wraps it up guys do discuss this card in
the forums do subscribe to Linus tech
tips and do check out the rest of our
CES 2013 coverage you're gonna love it
