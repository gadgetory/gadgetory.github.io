OCC sweet and we've actually got a ton
of new stock even more than we saw at
CES 2010 so there's a few things here
that probably won't have much relevance
to your everyday consumer now but it's a
bit of a glimpse into what we're going
to see in the future so this is a very
early mock-up of what's called an Ibis
XL so this uses the proprietary ocz HS
dl interface which is much much faster
than even say 262 gigabit per second so
you can see that back there it looks
kind of like a SAS connection but like I
said it is significantly faster so this
guy is available in capacities up to or
terabytes and then beyond that you can
even extend it to up to 16 terabytes so
that's pretty much unheard of at this
point for an SSD so moving right along
this is what I was talking about before
this is HS dl this is their Ibis drive
I've actually unboxed us on my channel
in the past so you guys should be pretty
familiar with this well here's an
optical version of HS dl so now we're
converting aged sdl into an optical
signal that we can carry over a much
thinner and probably potentially a much
longer capable cable depending on the
applications that we're trying to go for
here so that is one of the things that
they are showcasing here in this week
moving over we have some more things
that were already familiar with this is
revo drive x2 this is a bootable it uses
quad controllers for San force SF 1200
controllers you can actually hear if i
can get my cameraman to come in and have
a look at the overall specs so you guys
can read that rather than me listing off
everything but there's the key one up to
120,000 for ki ops this is a consumer
level product it is pricey but it is
within reach rebo drive is fewer
controllers lesser performance not
bootable but still a very high
performance storage solution so let's
keep moving on down here we're going to
find some more interesting stuff this is
z drive r3 and what's cool about this
guy is that not only does do we have z
drive level performance we are using a
newer sandforce controller the 1565 and
we also have full support for trim so
even though this is a raid on a
we do have trim support so that is just
a first I have never seen an SSD drive
in person before that supports raid and
trim well internal rate and trim at the
same time z-drive are two we've seen
this before as far as I can recall and
this is a cool one over here so this is
Helios this guy uses SAS 26 gigabit per
second this same thing here ocz has
built-in custom logic that allows it to
use an internal raid without actually
booting into a raid bios configuring the
drive and doing everything manually what
that means is they have bypassed all of
the limitations that existed in the past
for these internal raid drives but
they're still able to deliver
outstanding performance so up here you
can have a quick look with the ones that
we're looking at right now we're looking
at up to 85 ki ops at 4k but with the
newer controllers we can potentially
even double that so these are deneva
drives these ones are like I said not
everything here is going to be relevant
to consumers these are mostly geared
towards corporate customers and moving
along we have quite a few things that
we're familiar with like vertex 2 e ex
that's an slc version of the vertex 2 we
also have the vertex 3 pro but these are
preliminary specifications these are not
finalized this is using the new
sandforce SF 2582 controller which
supports say 236 gigabit per second so
check out those reeds and write speeds
those are well above the maximum rated
throughput of stata too so that is why
we did need to move while we owe CZ did
need to move to a SATA 3 interface
vertex 3 DX is that except slc flash so
slightly better performance better
longevity keep moving along here vertex
2 pro is pretty much like vertex to
accept it uses an SF 1500 controller
which means it does have power loss data
protection it has a super cap on it not
necessarily real relevant for your
everyday average Joe consumer but it's a
great option to have here's a vertex to
in a 1.8 inch form factor here's the
vertex to work
familiar with and this is a neat one so
this is a vertex two three and a half
inch drive but instead of using a big
boxy enclosure like here you can see
let's compare it against the idea so I
want to get that top down here up here
and then down yeah top-down perspective
on these so you can see they've built a
much slimmer three and a half inch
enclosure for that vertex to drive much
sleeker and sexier looking here we have
onyx and onyx to based on in the links
and SF 1200 so we've seen that before so
that's it for the ocz SSD s here in
their booth don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and I've got more videos
coming on CES ok cool so just as a quick
correction to what I said over there the
repo drive original version is bootable
my bad so anyway let's have a look at
this guy right here so I showed you the
z drive our three already but here we
actually have a working sample and this
is I'm not a hundred percent sure if
this is going to be the finalized
firmware finalized PCD layout all that
good stuff but this drive is booted it
is working in a computer remember this
is fully trim capable and it features
internal raid with a next-generation
sandforce controller and here you can
actually see if you have some context
for good for a doe benchmarks you can
see right here we've got read speeds
anywhere above anywhere above a bow 128
wow we're seeing up to about one
gigabyte per second remember that's not
one gigabit that's one gigabyte per
second read speeds up at the very very
high end and even approaching one
gigabyte per second on rights as well so
that's outstanding
one go we got another thing to check out
here in the ocz sweet i'm sorry the
Lighting's so bad in here guys so my
cameraman is gonna have to get pretty
close to show you these products so we
have a return of the original silencer
power supplies from PC power and cooling
so at risk of wrecking their demo I'm
going to go ahead and pick this up and
I'm going to show you guys the back of
this unit so it does use an 80
millimeter cooling fan but in order to
reduce airflow turbulence through the
power supply they've actually shifted a
lot of the components and cooling up to
the front of the power supply so that
right around the fan you don't get that
that hissing sound of the air rushing
around components so that's one of the
ways that they'd really optimize this
for silence now these are both 80 plus
silver models I'm not actually sure
which capacities are available other
than these two but so far we've got a
760 wat as well as a 9 10 watt and one
of the things that really stands out
about these guys other than the wide
variety of connections on them is right
here these feature a seven-year warranty
so that is pretty outstanding right
there next on sort of the other end of
the spectrum we've got the zs series so
this is a bit of a replacement for the
stealth extreme too they've added 80
plus bronze certification we've got a
three year warranty 500 607 wat 700 watt
capacities and one thing that they have
added on the 700 watt is for dedicated
PCIe connectors so you can run a modern
system with dual GPUs off of the 700
watt GS series without any difficulty
whatsoever and then this is this is the
big guns so this is the ZX series the
right here on holding the 1250 watt
power supply but there's an 850 watt as
well as a 1000 watt version that are
also available you can see these feature
a fully modular interface with 6
dedicated PCIe connectors now you can
see right here these modular connections
are all 8 pin so these are all 6 plus 2
pin connectors that means you can run
3gp use regardless of what kind and
you're not going to run out of
connectors now a lot of power supplies
will actually give you a bunch of PCI
Express connectors and then they'll give
you one cpu one in one like combo cpu
PCIe one and then your end
up with like one odd man out so they
have not gone that route they have given
you two dedicated eps 8 pin connectors 5
peripheral connectors and then one full
24-pin ATX I'm actually going to pick up
lowest wattage one here and I'm going to
see if we have a comparable business end
of that one so the only thing missing on
this guy versus the 1250 watt unit is
two PCIe sick are at eight pin
connectors and that makes sense because
this is an 850 watt power supply and
that probably wouldn't be suitable so
these guys are all 80 plus gold like I
said fully modular and they do come with
a five-year warranty so thank you for
checking out my little video but we will
seize power supplies in their suite
