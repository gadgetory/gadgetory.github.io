leaderboards the other day because Steve
over at gamers Nexus was talking some
smack about our benchmarking skills I
didn't see it though I don't watch his
videos as usual kingpin from EVGA is way
up at the top holding the record in
3dmark times by extreme and all that
stuff but when I looked a little closer
I saw what's this he's only using a 79
80 XC 18 core processor with 4 gtx 1080i
crapha cards I thought this is my
opportunity my one shot my mom's
sphaghetti I can't beat him with liquid
nitrogen cooling and like sawed off
graphics cards with custom power
delivery boards soldered to the back of
them but what I do have is better
hardware than that so my plan is to use
56 CPU cores in our ACC 621 Issei GWS
and for four of Nvidia squad Rho GV 100s
which cost a whopping nine thousand
dollars each and today's video is
brought to you by thermal take thermal
takes level 20 cases feature radiator
mounting for water cooling gaming
focused aesthetics and beautiful
tempered glass panels check them out at
the link in the video description
are you not entertained I'm gonna throw
in a quick spoiler alert here my
dastardly plan to troll you guys with
this setup didn't work out but it's
still worth going through the process
because it is a pretty unreal rig so
problem number one SLI support for
gaming on Quadros the GV 100 with its
high speed HBM to memory and massive
5,000 376 cuda cores should be a little
faster than a Titan V which is faster
than a gtx 980ti or titan XP right out
of the box so even though I can't
liquid-nitrogen cool these things I
should be able to make up a lot of the
difference in just outright faster
hardware except for one problem these
cards don't support 3-way or four-way
SLI so this right here is called an env
link connector and it is only designed
for these cards anyway to put two of
them together at a time so while you can
actually run SLI over any link it's not
really intended for that it's more for
resource and memory sharing and 3d
modeling or compute applications
fortunately though I do have a way
around that so this is a Quadro sync to
board and you'll probably recognize it
if you've watched one of our many k like
16k a gaming videos where we've used it
to game on an array of as many as 16
monitors at once now this thing's
purpose is primarily video display walls
like giant digital signage deployments
for example to keep the monitors from
getting out of sync which would cause
weird tearing issues but we already know
that it works for gaming as long as the
resolution we're running at isn't too
much for the frame buffer of each
individual card so that got me thinking
what if instead of plugging multiple
monitors into each one of the cards
because remember the more pixels each
card drives the
harder it is for you to run the game
what if instead of that we just ran a
single 1080p display out of each one in
a 2x2 grid for a total of 4k well these
are each 32 gig cards so should be just
fine
bringing us to problem number two even
if you had a monitor like this one it's
1080p it's got super thin bezels it's
inexpensive you still have a problem
nobody wants to game where 4 bezels
intersect because that's great where
your crosshair is this was by far my
favorite part of my idea for this video
and what prompted me to go ahead with it
now I had intended like I said to troll
you guys with some unbelievable
benchmarks with like a test bench under
a sheet or something to make you guys
think that I had RTX cards early or
something but you'd never buy that if I
had 4 of these monitors on an arm like
we did back when we did our first 8k
gaming setup so what if we used LG's 43
UD 79 it's 43 inches 4k and thanks to
its four separate inputs it could be
split into quadrants so let's get it set
up shall we
one thing I should do while we're
setting this up is give a massive
shout-out to Benny over at MX who did a
personal favour hooking me up very last
minute with one of these guys actually
two of them DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0
active adapters the active parts
important because well for one thing
these Quadros don't have HDMI so you
have to run DisplayPort and we've only
got two DisplayPort inputs on this
monitor only one of which is actually
usable because it's a Type C and you
can't adapt this to that there are
cables but they are directional cables
they don't go both ways the Quadro sync
2 card here only
if every one of these cards is hooked up
to the same type of display the card has
to think it's DisplayPort so that's why
the active signal adapter is important
in every card thinks it's hooked up to
DisplayPort just the amount of like
hassle that I went through you get this
thing working
no but it was totally worth it sort of
here's an example of one of those
directional cables they only go from a
type C output like on your laptop or
something
to a display port monitor they don't go
the other way it totally makes sense
it's just not something that I thought
about when this video was in the early
conceptualization stages can we all just
stop and appreciate for a moment that
this is 36,000 dollars worth of graphics
cards here I guess no props to Nvidia
for lending in to us even though we're
totally not doing what we said we were
going to do with them Nvidia gets real
cagey about gaming on Quadros they just
I don't like people talking about it
okay so HDMI for HDMI boom boom done
finish and you can see how seamless it
is as you move between them so you'll
get a little bit of tearing we got a
little bit vertically there generally
actually that's probably not the worst
I've seen but then you can see here
moving between these two we get nothing
oh and now you see it's being oh you
know so it's not perfect but I figured
it would be good enough to trick you
guys bring up some 3d mark here and
there it is time spy extreme I think
this would have been believable
hey you can see the characters walking
right through the intersection of all
four of them and you can't see any
pairing and yeah so that's pretty
underwhelming but perhaps if we weren't
so CPU bottleneck so while our CPU score
is actually really good like 10,000
that's just because we got a great score
in the CPU tests not because that CPU is
actually not causing a bottleneck for
our overpowered graphic setups so maybe
what we can do is transfer the whole
thing onto a bench with a 79 80 XE so
let me do that
maybe we can alleviate the CPU
bottleneck a little bit because we've
got lots of cores here but they're not
particularly fast you know you do enough
bench swaps you get pretty fast at it
and has expected this is really not a
lot better also I'm having another weird
issue where the color is a little bit
off on the bottom left quadrant for some
reason I've actually run this before on
both of these setups I have no idea what
it's doing this time as you guys can
imagine by this point in this whole
process I was feeling pretty discouraged
because we are a far cry from the
results that I was expecting I mean it's
not like the entire thing is terrible
like here we can we can fire up a game
here and see that actually like in game
performance looks pretty darn good and
we're just gonna ignore this weirdness
because this is the first time I've seen
that but this is not the benchmark
breaker that I was really hoping that it
would be oh I know what it is it's the
whole 0 to 255 versus 16 to whatever
black debt thing how do you adjust that
you know what I bet I have to break down
the mosaic you can see not in mosaic I'm
not having the issue so I think it's
just a matter of like it just went wonk
Oh for a second there yeah see it works
perfectly this time so let's run a game
or two on this thing
so what I can hope for here is that we
will get some pretty awesome frame rates
in GTA 5 why is this game so bad at
running in full-screen hey Anthony can i
bar you for a minute no I don't want it
like it can I just change more things
then one at a time like okay how do you
how do you crank it so the good news is
throughout the process of getting all of
our GTA 5 settings cranked this tearing
line down the middle is gone so that's
pretty cool now we can see if our 4k
performance is impressive because we
have got this thing dialed in to hurt
anything other than a godly graphics
card setup why is that off did it even
oh it did it registered everything else
just not the MSA so that's neat multiple
reboots later we've got all that on yes
I want to keep the new settings yes yes
yes and then we should be able to do
extended shadow distances now now let's
find out if in a situation where we're
not quite so CPU bottlenecked this thing
can knock our socks off Anthony are you
ready yeah are you ready are you ready
I'm ready
so what would you expect do you think so
that's that stuttering its suffering so
I still maintain this was a pretty cool
idea
perhaps works in gta5 dx11 yeah let's
just let's just throw it on here okay so
how impressed are you for $36,000 all
right let's see what it's actually
running out here yeah no no it's just
we're only running it like 30 FPS okay
what does a Peltzer v8 something are
they Oh 15 fps oh okay well I mean that
was clearly the framerate drops this is
very realistic car physics we've got
going on here I'm saying that they
probably wanted this car in their pool
and I'm doing them a favor
so basically between the amount of GPU
horsepower we have and the difficulty of
synchronizing them and managing
resources between them there are many
many bottlenecks that prevent this
theoretically cool setup from actually
performing well in the real world it's
making of performing well in the real
world Corsairs strafe mk2
or mark to mechanical RGB keyboard is an
update from the previous fan favorite
and now has all the features you've been
asking for it comes in either Cherry MX
red or Cherry MX silent switches with
Red's offering smooth and linear
actuation with silenced dampening the
sound by 30% it's got a hundred percent
Andy ghosting with 104 key rollover so
no matter how fast all of your
keystrokes are on the keyboard it will
register all of them it's got eight
Meg's of built-in storage so you can
take all your RGB configurations and
macro customization with you it's got
easy access multimedia audio controls
allowing you to make on-the-fly
adjustments and the top of the keyboard
is a built-in USB pass-through which
allows you to plug in a mouse smartphone
flash drive etc so check it out at the
