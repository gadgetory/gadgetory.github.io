microphone videos recently so this is
actually going to be the last one for a
while but I really wanted to cover this
one since aside from receiving a lot of
requests we've actually recently
switched to Rhodes modular lavalier
system for these videos and we're really
liking that so far on the subject of
liking things let your vote be heard
with the like button below if you want
to see us try something a little
different where I take on another
youtuber in an iOS versus Android debate
showdown but with a twist neither of us
will know which side will be defending
until we start
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click on
this spot right here to try it for free
so this is the NT USB I struggle with
physical overviews of microphones
because they're all pretty much the same
so I'll get this out of the way quickly
so we can move on to what it actually
sounds like included with your
microphone you'll find a leatherette
carrying case and I heart Road sticker a
manual the mic itself a rubber footed
tripod style stand the mic itself
apparently I put that twice in my script
I'm not going to worry too much about
that
on a standard threaded arm that allows
tilt adjustments the longest USB a 2b
cable that I think I have ever seen like
seriously they list this as a selling
point on the website 20 foot USB cable
and finally a really nice inclusion a
removable pop filter that's integrated
right into the microphone design to
prevent the microphone from being
overloaded by sounds it's something
everyone using a mic on their desks
should have and yet most manufacturers
not only don't include them in the box
but want an outrageous amount of money
for them if you want a really
nice-looking first party solution diving
into the mic itself a little deeper at
the front we find the grill for the
condenser module this is a side address
Mike with a cardioid pickup pattern
which means it will perform best up
close and personal with the source and
you should speak at it like this instead
of into the end like a stage microphone
on the bottom is a USB interface
full-size be in this case and on the
right is a couple of dials that
initially confused me I was expecting
one to be headphone monitoring volume
for the latency free three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack underneath it
this turned out to be correct and the
one above it to be microphone gain but
instead it's actually a mixer dial for
system volume versus microphone
monitoring volume so you can decide how
much of the music on your computer or
whatever other sounds you're singing
along with you hear versus the
sound of your own voice a very nice
touch so then where is the gain knob
great question Road actually uses an
internal gain setting that they've
determined is optimal and you only
adjust input levels with the software
control on your system
perhaps this gives someone out there a
bit less control but in my use while the
fixed gain only had the positive impact
of simplifying the experience and how
was that experience
great question I'm glad you asked I've
actually got an audio recording for this
from my desk so I don't need to say any
of this stuff at all I started with the
NT USB in its optimal podcasting or
streaming position directly in front of
my keyboard where I was typing in the
background and about 20 centimeters from
my mouth and frankly it performs
admirably here compared now to the blue
Yeti Pro from this distance the NT USB
does sound a touch more bass heavy and
announcer II but thanks to a bit of
extra sparkle in the highs
it doesn't suffer in terms of clarity
looks like a strong contender so far
throwing the Razer siren pro e lead into
the mix now we can see that background
hum show up more strongly here compared
to the other two perhaps thanks to its
additional emphasis on the mid-range now
starting with the NT USB it's time for
the second recording location next to
the monitor and out of the way this
would be ideal for Skype calls or just
general non broadcast use background hum
suppression is not as strong as the blue
Yeti Pro which makes a big difference
from this distance it still sounds good
just not quite as good as for the siren
Pro that peak around the frequency of my
voice and tendency to pick up more
background noise hurts it here as usual
finally the blue Yeti Pro rocks the
competition when it comes to distance
recording in a big way and that's
without leveraging any of its other
pickup patterns
although it should be noted that I stuck
with cardioid on both the Yeti Pro and
the siren Pro because I think the others
are basically useless anyway so that
leads us pretty tightly into the
conclusion does Road have a winner on
their hands yeah I think they do the
astute
you may have noticed already but the NT
USB has actually been fighting well
above its weight class against mics that
are $80 more expensive making it a very
attractive option especially for
beginner podcasters or streamers since
it lacks advanced features like multiple
pickup patterns and XLR input but
includes a stand and pop filter so
you're ready to rock right out of the
box
speaking of rocking out of the box on
it's out of the box thinking that if you
call a mobile carrier someone might
actually pick up the phone instead of
having an automated menu that you have
to navigate through in order to actually
speak to a human being and that's what
ting does so ting is the mobile carrier
that makes sense that's their tagline I
think I'm supposed to say that you pay
only for what you use with the average
ting bill only being about twenty four
dollars per month what's cool is if that
sounds appealing but you're kind of
sitting there going well hold on a
second because like I've got a bundle
now and I pay this much and it seems
like a pretty good deal you can actually
compare against ting by heading over to
