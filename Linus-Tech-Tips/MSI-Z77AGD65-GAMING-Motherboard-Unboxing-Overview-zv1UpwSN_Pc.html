look this is a bit of a strange product
because we're pretty close to the launch
of Intel's Haswell architecture and
that's gonna require a new socket but
MSI has just introduced their gaming
series of motherboards so it's gonna be
pretty obvious right from the start that
the z77 AGD 65 gaming takes a lot of
cues from the original z77 a GD 65 with
some enhancements so it doesn't cost
that much more but it does cost more but
you get a couple of things for your
money so number one is right here on the
front of the box and that's the killer e
20 200 game networking so that's Network
prioritization for your games the killer
software has some other cool features
like being able to bandwidth cap certain
applications through software like if
you want to limit the speed of a Youtube
upload for example you can do that
they've also got some fanatic branding
on I don't know how much team fnatic
knows about motherboards but at any rate
this particular series of motherboards
is recommended by team fnatic and it
comes with this pretty sweet sticker
that looks a little something like this
other than that we've got what is
essentially pretty much a DD 65 which is
a very solid board one of my favorites
to be perfectly honest on the z77
platform and let's have a look at what
they've got to say for themselves on the
back so yeah you still get OC Genie 2
which is one-button overclocking
military class 3 so that's military
class components having passed the mill
STD well I'm sure they mean standard not
STD 810g testing ok and then there's the
killer net we through net right there
which it's it's hard to say how much of
a difference that makes over a solid
intel networking solution but when I was
using it what I can tell you is that I
did notice for particularly for me the a
big difference in the convenience level
of being able to make on-the-fly
adjustments to how much bandwidth
applications are allowed to use so
here's that sticker I talked about
before it's a nice sort of solid sticker
got a 3m backing on it you put that on
your case should look pretty cool there
you go what else we got in here
all right four SATA three six gigabit
per second right angle cables alright
we've got em connectors so those are for
people who have trouble plugging in the
little connectors for front USB 2 as
well as front panel sort of switches and
whatnot
SLI flexible black connector those are
my favourites drivers and utilities
download this from the msi website
software an application user guide Quick
Start Guide user guide that a door
hanger love seeing these included I'm
sorry busy gaming and I'm not here so
those are the only two options
I'm busy gaming and not here at all
alright so voltage checkpoints and
finally the back panel connector which
has a new red and black color scheme can
you see that mural awesome
alright so let's have a look at the
board itself actually I shouldn't have
said that the networking thing was the
only thing that changed about it because
there were some other things as well so
layout wise we've got an all new cooling
solution so there's a single heat pipe
it's not a super pipe it's just a
regular-sized tea pipe that leads
between two sort of dragon themed
looking heat sinks they look outstanding
I kind of wish that it was a design
element that you could really appreciate
from the top because most of the time
you won't be looking at your motherboard
from this angle but either way it does
look outstanding and I do really I mean
I kind of I kind of geek out over sort
of mosfet cooling solutions because I
think they look cool so they've changed
that other than that the board is pretty
much GD 65 DNA so you've got your LGA
1155 socket here supporting up to second
generation core i3 i5 and i7 processors
all the overclocking features of course
enabled you've got an 8 pin connector
here for your CPU power 4 pin CPU fan
and then some more fans that are
elsewhere will show you those later for
ddr3 dimms slots supporting up to 8 gig
modules you've got onboard buttons which
I personally really appreciate I use an
open test bench a lot power reset and OC
Genie which is the one button
overclocking these little LEDs up here
show you how many power phases are
enabled up to 8 power phases on your CPU
so it'll really it's just an indicator
of what your CPU load looks like here's
your V check point so you can check CPU
voltage DDR
a few other key voltages using a
multimeter rather than relying on
software your 24 pin connectors and it's
ideal location along the right-hand edge
of the board this I love this is
probably worth like money to me like I'd
pay an extra few bucks for our board
with a right-angle USB 3 because those
connectors are so bulky and the cables
are so stiff that when you have to when
you try to cable management it ends up
coming in a big loop like this whereas
if it's on the side you can actually run
it somewhere directly without ending up
with a big huge loop so love to see that
we've got to say 2 3 6 gigabit per
second connections that are running off
the Intel chipset to say 2 3 6 gigabit
per second connections running off a
third-party chipset and 4 more say 2 to
3 gigabit per second connections running
off the Intel chipset you've got 3 USB 2
headers this particular one supports
superchargers so that's their fast
charging for tablets regardless of
whether it's iOS or whatever else a
hardware dedicated multi BIOS switch and
I'd like to tell a little story here
about my GD 65 board which saved my butt
because we've got we had a bad flash in
the middle of a power outage ok so we
were flashing the BIOS power went out we
had no ups it bricked it all I had to do
was flip the switch and we were back up
and running and we had a review deadline
that was coming up and it just totally
saved our butts so that made me pretty
happy so I love that switch you've got
an LED readout for post problems another
sort of dragon designed you know self
bridge heatsink honestly these start
cooling much these days anymore so you
know it's mostly for show 3 4 PCIe 1x
slots 3 PCIe 16x slots however it's
strongly recommended not to use this one
unless you are running a third
generation core processor so that's an
Ivy Bridge processor it should be noted
that you're going to be running an 8 X 8
X mode if you're running SLI or
crossfire and I do not recommend using
really any z77 board for 3-way SLI or
crossfire our configurations because
even the ones that have switches on them
I mean there are latency implications to
do with that as well so alright the
other the other improvement that's being
made here is a Sound Blaster cinema
implementation however this is a
software implementation it's still using
a real tech tip set
so it's hard to say how much of an
improvement that's going to deliver in
terms of things like you know headphone
clarity or whatever else but at least
you get some more software functionality
to go along with your new gaming
motherboard and the last thing that I
did miss initially was gaming ports so
they do have USB ports on the board that
are specifically optimized for 1,000
Hertz polling rates which some high-end
peripherals do support so you've got a
ps2 keyboard mouse combo part I do still
like to see these four USB 2.0 ports see
most clear switch optical and coaxial
digital audio out HDMI VGA and DVI 2 USB
3.0 ports there's that killer NIC port
and you've also got 7.1 audio out other
than that it's a GD 65 it's a GD 65 with
a better color scheme that cost a little
bit more do I object to this no I mean I
mean if you really think about it it's
like what kind of a build do you want to
make do you want a red one a yellow one
or a blue one because you could buy
yourself an empowered a DD 65 gaming or
a GD 65 and you're gonna have a pretty
similar experience you know the empower
is obviously ooc certified which means
that they hand test every board for
overclocking the gaming one has the
better LAN and sound implementations and
then the GD 65 vanilla is the vanilla
board but they all have pretty much the
same functionality and pretty much the
same performance when it comes down to
it don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips for unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and I hope you
enjoyed this video about the z77 a DD 65
