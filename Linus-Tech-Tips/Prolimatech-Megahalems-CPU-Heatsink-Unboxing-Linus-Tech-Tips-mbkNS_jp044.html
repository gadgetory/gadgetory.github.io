continuing our theme of floral backdrops
for unboxings which is quite tasteless
but effective nonetheless so today I'm
gonna be unboxing the truly matech mega
Halen's for no particular reason other
than I've heard good things about it I
wanted to have a look at it and I was
walking around in the warehouse and I
saw it so I grabbed it so that's the
that's the that's the whole reason for
it so why don't we see what it says on
the box so this is compatible with 7 7 5
and 11 or 1366 pardon me and that's
pretty much all it says always 790 grams
holy cow so that's well over a pound
attached to your CPU socket now
hopefully it has a pretty impressive
retention mechanism and I'm kind of
assuming it does but we'll find out soon
enough
okay so first thing you're gonna find
when you open up the box is your user
manual which shows you everything it's
supposed to come with and it labels
everything so comes with a heatsink a
couple back plates an aluminum strip
adapter double end stud with not screw
nut aluminum mounting plate screw loaded
navier you can probably read that cuz
awesome it's a thermal compound as well
and here are your installation
instructions so let's see step one is
install the backplate and put the screws
in and then step two is apply thermal
paste well that's pretty straightforward
well we'll try and figure it out as we
take this thing out here so why don't we
see what's included first I could get
this out then I'd be able to have a
pretty good look at it
ah okay well I think you're supposed to
take the heatsink out first I'm just
gonna grab that and then well yeah here
we go so you lift this up to get it the
accessories and here they are so inside
here we will find more plastic pegs oh
there we go so first there's a pro Lima
Tec thermal compound looks an awful lot
like Arctic cooling mx2 which it
probably is rebranded and then we've got
a couple of thumbscrews okay with
Springs then we have four thumb nuts
with no Springs
we have two back plates this is a seven
seven five back plate and this is a 1366
back plate then we have what are these
these must be the aluminum mounting
strip adapters awesome not sure exactly
how we use those and then these are the
double-ended from well I guess they'd be
screws so why don't we take out the heat
sink itself and have a look I'm actually
not gonna attempt to figure out the
mounting mechanism on camera because I'm
probably just gonna end up embarrassing
myself if I try and do that but I just
wanted to have a look at the
construction of this unit okay so as we
pull it out we can see it's a very very
shiny heatsink and there's actually a
foam spacer in between two distinctly
different halves of the unit here so you
can see that it's quite a dense thin
arrangement so you're gonna need a fan
with that generates decent static
pressure in order to best take advantage
of this particular heatsink then on the
bottom here you can see these are the
are those the adaptors for these I can't
even tell not know I'm not gonna try
let's have a look at the bottom of the
heatsink so I'm just gonna do the
obligatory finger shot and where I hold
my finger here and you have a look at
the reflectiveness it is clearly not
flat although it is quite polished but
what it does appear to have is a bow to
it so you're gonna want to mount a
heatsink like this nice and tight in
order to take advantage of the
incredible mounting pressure you can get
with a bowed base that means it comes
out like this okay so then this is six
heat pipes in total all of which make
contact quite close to the base of the
heatsink and thank you for checking out

lima tec mega Hallam's</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
