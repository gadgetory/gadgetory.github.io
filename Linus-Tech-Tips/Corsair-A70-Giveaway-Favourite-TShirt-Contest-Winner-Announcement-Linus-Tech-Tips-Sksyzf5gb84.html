70 that brand new sealed course are a 70
cooler and I have to say I'm a little
bit disappointed in all of you I got a
grand total of eight that's right aight
video responses in the two months or
however long that's been up and look at
this look at this not one but two people
had the audacity to upload videos with
newegg boxes in them see this guy's too
bad because i really like his shirt but
he's got a new egg box behind him in the
background you can see the forensic
evidence clearly here so since newegg is
a competitor of NCIX where i actually
work I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take
take marks off for that one ah this
one's okay it's linux which is kind of
close to Linus so that's that's very
close but I think my personal favorite
out of all of the videos here is mmm let
me think well we have a look at some of
the other entries because I'm just
started deciding now this one was a bird
I don't know about that one I think this
one was pretty good I think this one was
pretty good this is one of my favorite
t-shirts that I own Microsoft as
monopolies and and he even provided
proof that it was actually his shirt by
putting his name in it either that or
he's a reasonably good at photoshop not
even reasonably good I mean that's not
actually that hard to do ACDC this was
this shirt not hmm not my favorite band
in the world let me see what was this
one I think this one was pretty good
this one was pretty good so I'm just
showing all the entries here I've
already watched them as you can see
allergic to stupid people I have to
agree with that sentiment stupid people
are not not my favorite either I think
this one is gonna have to get my vote
though just because he's actually gone
and presented several shirts aha youtube
see I love YouTube because YouTube lets
me talk to all of you and then his next
shirt is actually a google shirt
and I'm just gonna skip ahead this video
is way too long but he also got 406
views which is pretty good and as a
youtuber I respect more views so there
you go he's got a google shirt that he
showed the camera for about 3 seconds
he's talking about how its
environmentally friendly ok that's it
bad spell as the winner out of the eight
people who responded and one of them was
like an unboxing video it wasn't even a
tshirt video you win the course are a 70
send me a private message on YouTube and
you win I will ship you a free cpu
cooler thank you everyone for playing
and don't forget for any future contests

at what the odds worth 8 video responses

winning exactly a one-in-eight chance of
winning don't forget to subscribe and
