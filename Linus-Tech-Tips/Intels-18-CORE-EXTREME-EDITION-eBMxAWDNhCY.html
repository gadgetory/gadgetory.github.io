some CPUs with legitimately great
performance like the 7900 X that we
reviewed but then we also got a bunch of
confusion
we got the unnecessary KB Lake X there
was that whole thing with the bootable
cpu-based nvme raid that Intel still
hasn't fully enabled on their desktop
for fear of encroaching on their
lucrative xeon market to say it was sort
of disorganized would probably be an
understatement but that was yesterday
today is all about a new threat to xeon
from Intel themselves again the core i9
79-80
XE extreme ignition with 18 cores and
acclaimed teraflop of compute power it's
a true halo product a shining beacon of
the technology that will become
affordable in the future and you can
have it today
but it won't come cheap and neither do
Linus tech tips videos today's video is
brought to you by cyber powers lineup of
gaming desktops featuring until seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below
so what's a hike or count core i9 anyway
think of it this way
it's like higher core count anything
with more than the last generation
flagship ten core is a hike or count so
the core I 979 80 XC 18 core is actually
launching alongside a whole range of HCC
chips the 16 core core I 979 60 X along
with a 14 core and 12 core and okay Real
Talk Intel I love you guys but your
naming scheme you guys are actually
stepping on your own mobile CPU model
numbers it's confusing anywho in terms
of features there's no real surprises
here you've got your turbo boost 3.0
hyper threading giving you up to 36
threads 44 PCI Express Lanes etc all of
these new processors are fully enabled
with the features that we've come to
expect from a skylake X core I 9 on the
X 299 platform so what are we testing
then aside from core counts and clock
speeds I'll tell you yes it's really
just the core counts and clock speeds
but just doesn't do it just this because
this is more added horsepower than we've
seen in one generation since the core
series began think about it last gen the
best we had this side of Xeon was 10
cores on the I 769 50 X and the big
reveal this year was supposed to be a
new 10 core for about half its price
which we did get but this fully fleshed
out lineup looks like more than just a
refresh it looks like a fresh more
competitive Intel I guess they didn't
want another AMD sees a gap in the
lineup and goes for it scenario like
with Rison 7 which isn't to say though
that AMD has nothing competitive their
rise in thread ripper 1950 acts also
rocks almost as many cores at 16 with 32
threads while costing a cool $700 less
could the new core I nines
really justify that much of a price gap
to find out we grabbed a chi DT CPUs
from Team Blue and team red and then for
good measure a core I nine 7900 X and
the 22 core xeon e5 $26.99 v4 from last
gen all of them were SPECT out with
otherwise identical hardware right down
to the cooler we'll begin with our
productivity workloads which actually
sees a pretty significant performance
difference between the core i-9 and even
the 22 core Xeon in 7-zip and CPU mark
while asus real bench shows a
predictable curve for the I nines in the
image editing test but finds them for
some reason trailing Fred Ripper here
despite multiple reruns to confirm
smaller blender scenes like the BMW and
fishy cat see a slider difference
between the 16 and 18 core chips while
the more complex scenes like gooseberry
and Pavillion Barcelona stretched things
out a bit more interestingly thread
Ripper manages to stay on Intel's heels
here it generally outperforms its price
competitor the 7900 X thanks to its much
higher core count but in a twist ending
that surprised no one it's lower per
thread performance does hurt it in some
cases now while gaming isn't in any way
the focus of this class of CPU or this
video and we had to test it and honestly
the results were as expected pretty
underwhelming the high core count for I
nines pull out some early leads at 1080p
and deus ex but slip and rise of the
Tomb Raider and then everything levels
off at 4k for both titles the sole
exception out of our gaming tests then
becomes counter-strike go which at both
1080p and 4k shows a significant lead
for Team Blue synthetics meanwhile give
a slight edge to Team Blue in 3d mark
and Unigine super position sees similar
scores across the board the most
interesting thing about gaming on any of
these is how thoroughly trounced they
all get by a core i7 for a fraction of
the price in all but the great equalizer
4k though this too should surprise no
one baby thermals will be more
interesting well actually looks like all
of our processors stayed nice and cool
with an h1 15i but the higher base clock
of the 70 960
actually put it closer to thread Ripper
in that department power consumption is
also pretty straightforward more coarse
more juice but with that said our thread
Ripper platform in general seems to pull
fewer watts from the wall it should be
noted here though that we didn't test
over clocks for this review since our X
299 boards vrm well we don't trust it to
handle overclocking one of these for
long and believe it or not we don't
purposely try to ruin our equipment
around here some preliminary readings
though at 4.4 gigahertz have this CPU
alone pulling about 500 Watts off the 12
volt rail so you're gonna want to pair
this beast with a top-of-the-line board
like a rampage extreme and a heavy-duty
power supply in order to keep the juice
flowing I mean the wires get disquieting
ly warm at these kinds of loads or you
could just not overclock so finely then
value our weighted performance numbers
put the newly launched in core I nine 79
80 XC and seventy-nine 60 X at the top
of the performance heap but when we look
at their pricing they do fall behind due
to their massive price tags with that
said price isn't the only consideration
at this level it is likely that these
CPUs will go into render machines and
high-end workstations where when you're
deploying a lot of them at a time
performance per watt is also an
important factor and while they still
fall behind the difference is
predictably much less dramatic than
price was so what's the point of these
products at all then because clearly
they make no sense for the average
consumer or gamer that's true but as
long as you don't need ECC Ram support
an HCC core I 9 workstation is going to
be hands down the fastest you can buy
with the capability to overclock it if
you're an enthusiast prosumer for truly
Zeon crushing raw performance let's just
hope though that you'll be using your
new monster to generate revenue for your
business because otherwise the dent in
your wallet versus the performance might
not be worth it compared to well Intel's
own lower end line up or AMD's thread
Ripper
speaking of ripping why don't you rip up
your existing contract with your mobile
carrier because King is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and satisfaction first don't
speak to a robot get put through
directly to a person if you have an
issue and pay only for what you use with
the average ting bill coming in at only
23 bucks a month per device if you're
stuck in a contract and you switch to
ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks
and they have lowered mobile data rates
now as well it's just $10 a gig beyond
the first gig so go check them out at
Linus ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator to see if you'll save then
when you sign up use our link because
you'll get 25 bucks in service credit or
towards a new device so thanks for
watching guys thanks again to ting for
sponsoring this video and well if you
guys didn't like this video you know
what to do but if it was awesome get
