bang for the buck PC but they have to do
it without internet they've got three
days to do it and on the fourth day we
find out who the winner is in this
edition of scrapyard Wars brought to you
by D brand so it's day three and at this
point I have pretty much accepted that
there is a most excellent chance that
I'm gonna lose this thing this is gonna
come across a little desperate but I'm
gonna text this guy yet again text
number five hey didn't find a graphics
card yesterday if I come down there can
we talk about a price I can't believe
that this guy wants me to drive all the
way to his store it's like a 45-minute
Drive before he will even begin to talk
about a price with me if the price was
any good you'd think he would just tell
me the price because then I'd be willing
to drive 45 minutes so now that I'm not
saying I need a price before I can come
there he replies immediately within two
minutes this guy sent me five freaking
messages no three all right
the address the name of the shop and
instructions to come around 12:00
because apparently I'm on his schedule I
don't really like this guy I want to
swing by geeks R Us and have a look at
their old workstations because if
they're in similar condition to Carol's
and if Carol's fellow shopkeep guy is
like yeah these are worth you know a
couple hundred bucks then if we buy one
from them for a couple hundred bucks
we're not bad people so where did these
turn up from did someone come in for
some new machines and just kind of drop
the old ones with you sorry what are
they called GEEP and you can just buy
lease returns from them could I could I
get a number for these returns of course
people who lease computers they need
somewhere to give back the stuff that
they basically paid for completely I was
given your number and extension by geeks
R Us so they had said that if we were
looking for an older workstation you
might be the guy to talk to would it be
possible for me to come down there and
check in check it out
unfortunately it would be just one I
mean I don't I don't need you to tear
down a skid for me or anything like that
to just to show it but if you just have
like a piece of paper that I can look at
or or an electronic listing I can kind
of go yeah yeah that one if you'd be
willing to do this for me it would it
would be awesome it would make my day
long story but I actually don't have
access to email right now I just want an
older workstation I'll do the conversion
on my own just something something with
with a a quad core or six core Xeon and
it would be perfect as long as it has a
decent power supply all right thanks
anyway scrapyard Wars is brought to you
by D brand their new Nintendo switch
skins are available now
you can also order a tempered glass
screen protector for your switch these
things look great and they're durable
helping with scratch resistance like
this to help you keep from damaging your
device even if you're an idiot goes like
this and put your keys all over your
device like what are you doing anyway
you can learn more at the link in the
video description honestly I'm thinking
of just showing up there I don't I don't
buy it
we we do volume deals we have a
first-gen what is he what does it even
mean by that I think he just doesn't
want to do it so he's telling me they
don't have it but there's no way how
could they how could they have a
building with skids of stuff that's not
fourth gen or third gen or I don't know
like his the owner or like this is just
a sales guy that these guys deal with I
don't know where like if he's the owner
and I call back like he's probably gonna
tell whoever it is to not deal with me
on principle but if he's just like one
of the guys and I can talk to someone
else maybe they will help me up
I could try just showing up that GEEP
and seeing if someone will help me but
that's a super pushy dick move I can try
going back to Carroll and saying like
hey Best Buy has an open box system that
frankly I think is pretty comparable to
this for 269 you know what can you do
for me I don't think she's gonna want to
sell it though says they open at 10 a.m.
but I guess not today
I dunno she's not feeling well so maybe
they just aren't open yet
all right so we're heading to Best Buy
first thing to pick up that a-10 based
system because that price is just really
hard to beat so I'm gonna try to go with
that angle and then we're gonna head to
crystal mall to go find that guy they
gave us the $30 power supply deal I
might actually try to buy it cheaper one
of his power supplies because I realize
the graphics cards I'm gonna be buying
probably only need one PCIe power so I
probably don't need the extra power
cable so I can go with the hopefully
cheaper power supply so I'll talk to him
about that also I might try to tone down
the graphics card that sounds very it
that it is was he
did he buy anything okay okay thank you
thank you I appreciate it
interesting okay so for two hundred and
three dollars and sixteen cents we have
a computer we could technically compete
with this right now I've even thought
about it actually because the APU in
here can technically play games
so it actually might be worth just going
with a $203 computer I'm still I'm still
debating it I'm gonna drive around we're
gonna look at other parts and see how we
can do our pricing and whatnot but we
have a computer we got it from Best Buy
and someone tried to teach me how to
mineral oil a computer which was
actually like a really cool experience
because I don't think he knew me and
that's that's pretty sweet but yeah we
have a computer time to move on let's go
this is not gonna be the greatest thing
in the world oh yeah that for 1499 whoa
this here dual fan single single tower
of seventeen buffer seventeen bucks so
that's what I mean you know if you
thinking about I have four to twelve
yeah it's probably gonna put you over
over what's gonna but seventeen bucks is
how much too bad fifteen dollars there
to stay in the spirit of the competition
that like modding is involved I'll get a
I'll get a cooler and then I think we're
probably gonna be done yeah okay
cool I think yeah yeah I doubt like
literally two dollars is gonna break the
bank and this one's on a three dollar
sale I'm probably gonna go with this one
okay so we came out of there
Canada computers with a $44 and
eighty-eight cent SSD before tax and a
like I think $16 and $0.99 CPU cooler
before attacks and we're done
I think I think we're just to go to the
office and build the computer now which
seems weird because there's so much time
left but I stood in front of their tech
desk and just like wondered about things
out loud about oh I wonder how well this
CPU would do in the game without any
other modifications and just kept
standing there and
kept openly pondering about things until
they started searching on the internet I
never asked them to I never asked them
to at one point he's like but apparently
an extremely similar 8n processor got
loads of 30 at fortnight hi some of the
settings were set to low but in general
I think that's enough for me
so we're coming from actually like way
off the map over here in highway 10 you
need to take highway 91 I actually don't
know how much attend 70 costs to do
right now so I'm not gonna have the
context to know if this guy is trying to
fleece us or not
so I need to
call memory express over the phone
and asked for a price on the graphics
card over the phone hi could I get a
price on it on a gtx 1070 I really hope
that place isn't it computer repairs and
vape shop one-stop seems legit
are we we're not even in the right place
at all we need four three one nine this
is so confusing
okay so tempered glass protectors
Chargers repairing they do like phone
unlocking karaoke songs hi I'm sorry Oh
cuz he's he's helping me make a video
about my my search here so his story for
why he has the part very disjointed he
said something about building a few
systems and then
he's got this one and then something
about he built one for someone they
ended up getting his otech 1080 they
didn't want this one
but then the cards got a bunch of dust
on it like
none of those things add up but
400 bucks for a 1070 400 Canadian was a
good deal I'm gonna buy it I think we
just killed it like fricking killed it
no no not it do you live very close by
high bore your washroom where are you on
the way somewhere okay forget it
community center heck yeah thank you
okay we got a lead you know what oh we
should drive there I shouldn't just
leave my car here in the alley there's a
few things that I noticed one this thing
has a DVD drive worth probably nothing
but still it has a wireless LAN and
Bluetooth card it's not on the
motherboard it's a separate device and
there's a two terabyte hard drive those
are all things that are not required for
this competition and I have a lot of
time left so I might be able to go sell
those because at my price point even
like 20 bucks is a pretty good bump and
if I can make up the cost that I spent
on the cooler that might be pretty cool
there it is
so we're in for tonight and this is the
lowest poly for tonight character I've
ever seen it looks terrible current
frame rate is 15 oh but the display so
it's trying to run it at 4k so the
hopefully that's what's going on why
can't I change the okay it's running way
better now
thing we need perhaps kind I pull the
dirt I don't often use ap use so I'm not
like usually if I don't have a graphics
card in a system you can kind of just
run Windows Update you get your CPU
stuff everything's fine
so I didn't have an AMD display driver
which is very possibly what the problem
was which is really really really really
good if that's true and makes more sense
because like that was pretty bad I
expected more out of it than that I'll
have to see in a game we'll have to see
in a game but right now that gave us a
hundred more FPS so we're in the loading
area with tons of other people and it's
bouncing all the way between like really
depends what's going on but we're
looking like 60 to 70
so that possibly I yeah probably
and I was wondering if I could mean
trade before I have a 2 terabyte hard
drive so he's not gonna trade him for
the stuff which I probably should have
seen coming honestly I thought he'd take
the 2 terabyte hard drive cuz he's got
some used stuff and it looks like he's
building a computer back in there so I
thought he might actually be able to use
a 2 terabyte but I guess not
I'm not surprised he didn't care about
the optical drive or the wireless cry
but whatever let's move on what he does
have is he's selling all of his power
spikes for 30 bucks it doesn't matter if
it's 550 watts 650 watts 875 watts there
30 bucks so that's fine I might as well
take the really nice one
he's also got a 950 and a 666 60 I don't
want that the 950 is 80 bucks Brandon
thinks I should haggle him down I can
try to do that he might go for it I
needed to do some math for a sec I need
to think about this the more I think
about it the more that gtx 1070 is both
a blessing and a curse because on the
one hand it's a great deal for a 1070 on
the other hand i don't know that it's
the best bang for the buck graphics card
and it kind of handcuffs me because i no
longer have the option of just showing
up with an APU system now that I've
spent $400 on a graphics card now I have
to find something that doesn't
bottleneck it too badly or this is gonna
be last season all over again well that
was really disappointing the guy I
talked to at the receiving door in the
back was actually pretty helpful
he was like yeah we might have something
like that maybe you can go upstairs and
talk to our sales guy and he'll help you
out but then on my way up someone
intercepted me and I explained you know
we're
making a video documenting you know what
you might do to try and get a deal on a
computer system and he was basically
like well you can't do any of that here
go away like this is a secure facility I
don't know what the big deal is with
their like old refurbished electronics
and all that maybe it's far more
valuable than I would guess but they
were like yep get out of here
send us an email so for you guys out
there something like a refurbish er like
this might be an option but I don't
think we're gonna get anything done I'm
gonna try calling again I mean what's
the worst I can do annoy him more I'll
be like look I'm I'm outside I just want
to come in and buy something but I I
doubt it's gonna go anywhere I'd like to
buy something right now if possible okay
can you talk to me outside it all right
thanks anyways okay so the Surry Best
Buy and the nicest possible terms gave
us a hard time about having a camera in
their store and did their best to help
us out with like an open box or a
clearance deal or something like that
but just did not have anything so we are
seriously running out of options right
now I'm gonna call that Cloverdale
computers and see if they ever even
opened up today hey Carol yeah it's
Linus okay can you do 350 for the tower
okay okay okay thank you without knowing
what their cost structure is and knowing
that they might not be the savviest
buyers I did feel a little bad making an
offer that was like a quarter of the
sticker price but I mean they they
bought it it's worth what it's worth I
need a computer
oh man do we have two three okay okay so
okay so the math is based on what I
could get an 810 7800 system and an
upgraded power supply for which i think
is pretty equivalent can you do it for
like oh man can you do it for 360 okay -
deal - deal okay all right let's do it
all right I'll be right there back
you're not gonna believe the video card
that I'm gonna run away it did not I see
it it's still here
very funny saw me come in did they
you're not gonna believe the video card
I got to put in it we got a DTX 1074 400
bucks yeah so that consumes pretty much
all of our budget but that's gonna turn
it into actually a pretty beastly gaming
machine so
yeah the one that's in here absolutely
totally a done deal
holy smoly well that's my receipt for
that there but their cash purchased
there for better or for worse this is
what we've got gtx 1070 64 gig SanDisk
ex 110 this is just our USB for
installing windows off of that doesn't
count and this Lenovo workstation no way
look where it came from all the three
deals I think the highlight is the
graphics card that SSD honestly is worth
10 bucks and that Tower it's worth what
I paid in the sense that compared to
buying a machine brand-new at Best Buy
and then a power supply to put in it and
then drumming out the hard drive cages
to cram in a graphics card and putting
some holes in it for cooling it's worth
it in the sense that compared to that
it's an okay deal
but if I had more time to shop and if I
was able to shop online I could have
done better than that Tower
Hey Hey we've got display output so
theoretically that means we're not
totally locked down booting windows off
a hard drive one thing I regret is
wasting a lot of my time on the first
day the sign on the back of the car the
shirt those were completely stupid but
the phone book that was actually an
excellent investment even though it was
kind of challenging to get one and the
map was a hundred percent worth the
seven dollars I'm confident that I have
a working system and that I will have a
working system I just have a lot of
misgivings about whether it's the best
bang for the buck dbrand is the place to
go for awesome
final skins it's been that way for a
while but there's something new now you
can finally skin your Nintendo switch
and your switch accessories including
your joy Kahn's
like look look how adorable it is with
pink and purple but we could also swap
those out we could throw white on there
as well as your pro controller and even
your base station they use high quality
authentic true textured 3m vinyl on
every product they feature unrivaled
precision they've got an amazing
configurator on their site so you can
preview what your products gonna look
like and decide well I'm gonna maybe I'd
like I don't know green and white one
like that look and their customer
service robots aren't easy to work with
and wonderful their products are
affordable and they ship worldwide and
you can check them out today at the link
in the video description
next time on scrapyard wars I don't know
if this generation even worked like that
I might be better off pulling out these
things in the bag our junk I'm trying to
sell them to you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
