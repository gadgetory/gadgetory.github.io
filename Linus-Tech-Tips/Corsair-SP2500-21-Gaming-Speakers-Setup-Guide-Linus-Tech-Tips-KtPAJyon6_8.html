for the Corsair SP 2500 2.1 gaming
speaker setup so it's actually really
easy it's simpler than most things are
to setup so the first thing I'm going to
show you is where to plug everything in
to the back like I said pretty
self-explanatory so you take the
included cables which are proprietary
cables because we are using dual emp'd
satellite speakers you plug them into
the color-coordinated spots on the back
of the subwoofer so I've got another one
over here I'm gonna plug that in just
like that and that's it we have
connected the speakers so contrary to
what you might think these are not for
the speakers that is what I originally
thought - if that's what you thought
okay then we're going to take our audio
cable and we are going to this is also
included take it from the back of our
computer and plug it into here now you
can actually plug in a couple more audio
sources including one here that's
line-in so anything that uses these
coaxial stereo connectors you can plug
in and then we will also need to plug in
our color remote so that right there is
going to be tangled up with something
else and then I will find it and plug it
in right like that and then there's also
another input an auxilary two input
built in to the remote up here so I'll
show you guys that right there there's
your auxiliary - and then if you want to
bypass the whole speaker setup and you
want to plug in your headphones there's
a jack for that there as well last thing
is to get a standard PC power cord and
plug that into the back of the subwoofer
just like that and now you are
officially on well when you get the
power switch I guess you're on there you
go so you're going to need to select
which input you want to use the menu is
accessed with this button right here so
you can go ahead and access the menu so
the input that we're using right now is
auxilary one although you can change it
to whatever you want it to be there's
also a couple other things that you can
set up in here
you can set up which EQ you want to use
so there's classic pop jazz mod X which
is for movies action drama FPS action
action gaming headphones which
compensates for lousy gaming headphones
and then reference and then there's also
a setup menu so you can change the
backlight you can change the color
scheme to night mode which looks like
that okay you can go back to the main
menu and okay so these are yeah but you
can program it to different listening
experience kinds of sounds karaoke is a
kind of a neat sounding one so you can
play whatever songs you have and it'll
try and take out the the voice late
night is also pretty good it redirects
most of what would normally go to the
subwoofer to your satellite so that you
won't disturb your neighbors or roommate
or whoever else happens to have the
misfortune of living near you if you
have a rocking speaker setup like this
so I'm going to put it back to none and
I think that's pretty much out you know
what there's actually a little bit more
functionality in here so I'm just going
to whoops it's hard to do this
upside-down believe it or not so here
you can adjust the volume and with this
one you can adjust the subwoofer so you
can adjust the subwoofer level and the
volume with those two buttons you adjust
your menu here and then you can power
the whole thing down just like that so
that is it that is the setup guide but
wait there's more that I forgot so you
can also use these little stands if you
have a desk that is positioned kind of
under you like say for example I was
sitting at my desk and I'm about sort of
this tall like let's say I'm kind of
like a tall guy right and so my speakers
are basically blasting music at my chest
and stomach so I can go ahead and I can
take these little stands and I can put
them under my speakers they are included
and then I can aim them more at my head
because that's how you're going to get
the best stereo listening experience is
by aiming the satellites at your ears
which are the auditory receptacles of
your face so thank you for checking out
