get to you guys this is the Radeon HD 69
50 but what's special about this one is
right here this is a one gig version of
the ever popular 69 50 which means that
well basically and you can check out the
reviews on any number of the popular
review sites my personal favorite these
days is Hardware Canucks comm but
basically what this card offers is most
of the performance of a 69 50 regular
card with a lower price because it has
less memory and so it is therefore less
expensive so let's have a look at what
are the key features here so HD 3d it
supports 3d Blu ray as well as 3d gaming
DirectX 11 Eyefinity and believe this
one supports I don't remember I think
it's something like four or five
displays or something ridiculous like
that guys please leave a comment with
how many displays are supported by this
particular card an eye affinity parallel
processing high-speed gddr5 memory
CrossFireX multi GPU support which is
very nice Oh what else do we got here
hdmi 1.4 a with support for starett
stereoscopic 3d so that's a big one and
DisplayPort 1.2 okay what else do we got
here five star support okay so that's
more of an XFX specific thing ah okay
AMD eyefinity you can support three or
more displays to enable more than two
displays native DisplayPort connection
or certified DisplayPort adapters must
be used okay and have a look now one of
the things that you will notice about
this and any 69 51 gig card is that
these cards are no longer based on the
original reference design which used the
same PCB as the 69 70 so that means the
unlocking trick is not an option here
folks
there's a little brochure for XFX Pro
Series power supplies with five-year
warranty their power supplies are
exceptional by the way in case you guys
are wondering and you
it's someone other than XFX to tell you
that here's the North American limited
warranty
don't forget XFX has actually I wonder
what the warranty is on this particular
car I actually don't you know let me
have a look because many XFX cards do
have lifetime warranty but I don't know
if it's necessarily all of them these
days okay well let's see what it says in
here guys
the limited hardware warranty okay what
it's not covered by limited hardware
warranty how long does it last
the limited hardware warranties for a
period of two years two years for this
one oh okay if you register the product
online within 30 days of purchase your
limited warranty will be extended for
the duration of your life I don't forget
that you can transfer the limited
warranty to one other owner and XFX also
covers it has a modder friendly warranty
so if you replace the stock cooler and
it's the card breaks after you've been
using it with the nonstop cooler for a
while as long as you were using it
correctly and as long as you can return
the card to its original condition you
still have one two hundred three nice
huh driver see the installation guide
don't use the driver CD don't use that
installation guide just download latest
drivers off the NAD website and the
driver installation CD you throw it away
and I love these XFX door hangers do not
disturb I'm gaming I've been doing this
a fair bit lately but I'm actually gonna
go on a little adventure into the other
part of my house
you can see my cat again hey you
hello and I'll show you guys I actually
have one of the older XFX do not disturb
I'm gaming door hangers this is back
when XFX was geforce only so there you
go there's their support information as
well so yeah that's one of my one of my
favorite little swag bits to get in a
box with something is actually these
door hangers I think they're neat okay
in here we have a crossfire branch
that's it fine and the card itself so
not only does it not use a reference PCB
but this card also does not use a
reference cooler so let's show you guys
what's going down in this funky town so
here's the 69 50 you can see right here
it's using a vapor chamber cooler design
so you can tell that from the flat
rectangular copper piece at the back so
you can see the corners here here here
and here and then that vapor chamber
actually has like a flower style
heatsink here you can I'm gonna position
myself under the light a little bit
better so you guys can see but you can
see the way that the airflow is going to
go through this fan is that it's going
to come in here and then it's actually
going to go not only down into the
flower fins here but also to the side
and it will be making use of this
surface area over here as well then
it'll be exhausted out of these vents
which is gonna cause some warm air to be
recycled but it shouldn't be too bad as
long as you don't have a card right
directly next to it and then also all
out the top here as well as presume oh
not at the bottom okay so only out the
top and then out the back so the voltage
regulation stuff is all in whoops is all
in here and you're gonna get some
incidental airflow from the fan blowing
air this way and then having it coming
out the back of the card like a
reference 6950 on the 2gig version this
uses two 6-pin PCI Express connectors
for power on the back you can see XFX is
trademark matte black PCB love it
everything looks good in matte black
everything the whole computer should
just be matte black and that would be
optimal so here we've got all of our RAM
chips on the back of the card we've also
got the GPU itself there's the bat power
connectors and here's all of our display
connectors and speaking of those why
don't we have a look at what options we
have so there's a little XFX logo I
don't turn this around so we can enjoy
that XFX logo and all of it
right-side-up glory so we've got two DVI
connectors one HDMI IN to display parts
and my assumption would be this card
supports up to four wait I finna D so
two of these two of these or two of
these and to these and yeah so these are
mini DisplayPort just so you guys know
if you're not familiar with that
particular connector so this mini
DisplayPort to display port adapter can
just be a passive adapter it's not
expensive quite inexpensive indeed and
let's just have a closer look at the
front of the part itself because it's
actually quite an quite a sharp-looking
card there's the you can't really tell
in the camera but these are chrome
accents here okay and then this is grey
and this is black so it's uh once you've
got that installed in your system it's
gonna be like to be nice looking
actually you can see that shine there so
yeah you get pretty much all of the
performance of the 6950 unless you're
running at uber high resolutions like
eyefinity triple HD resolution or if
you're running at 2560 by 1600 you need
that additional frame buffer the two gig
card will perform better but if you
don't need it the one gig card will
perform just as well so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the XFX Radeon HD
6950 one gig graphics card oh hey here's
something cool Oh totally forgot to
mention this got to crossfire fingers so
that supports up to 3-way crossfire X
also runs on PCI Express standard 16 X
connector and last but not least check
this out so they've still got that BIOS
which on here so you can actually load
an aftermarket BIOS in one of the
positions and then if it doesn't work
you can just flip yourself back to the
original BIOS with this little switch
