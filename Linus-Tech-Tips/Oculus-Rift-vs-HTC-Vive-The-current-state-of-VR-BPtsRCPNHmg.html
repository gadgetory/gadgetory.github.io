battle that I have been following very
closely and up until recently the whole
scene has felt rather dominated by the
oculus rift then oculus launched
pre-orders at a few hundred dollars more
than people expected right around the
same time that HTC decided to show off
their HTC pre their newest prototype
which was a tremendous improvement over
their previously shown off headset so
where to both teams stand now well if
you asked a month ago I swear the public
opinion would have been with oculus but
I ran a Twitter poll very recently that
received over 3,000 votes and left them
at 50/50 so the battle is close let's
take a deeper look
the Scimitar RGB from Coursera features
17 programmable buttons a 12,000 dpi
optical sensor and a shape designed for
comfort in MMO and MOBA gaming learn
more in the video description down below
now like I said things have changed
relatively recently for both teams
mainly on the HTC vive side so let's
start with a refresher this is going to
be a long video hold tight the consumer
version of the oculus rift will be
running a resolution of 2160 by 1200
split between two oled displays running
at 90 Hertz which are oriented in
portrait not landscape which is an
interesting decision these screens and
their new lenses that make things look a
little bit more clear when looking at
them directly and a little bit more
distorted when looking near the edges
will be able to move independent of the
headset which will allow them to
accommodate IPD ranges of anyone between
the 5th and 95th percentile your fov
will be above 100 degrees but will
depend on how close the screen is to
your face the fit and finish of the new
rift has been very impressively improved
not only is it very surprisingly light
but it feels like quality when you hold
it which is uncommon in a light device a
lot more fabric was added to the design
which at first sounds kind of horrible
because absorbing oils and sweat from
your skin but Palmer has said that while
you won't be able to throw the fabric in
a washing machine it will be washable
the foam part that touches your face can
be completely taken off of the headset
and replaced if you so wish the side
straps now have Springs built into them
which pulls the triangle light plate for
the back of your head in so that it's
nice and snug while you're trying to fit
it on it also comes with a pair of on
ear headphones these are mounted on the
headset and have been the source of a
ton of controversy audio files are
complaining that they're paying for junk
on your headphones when they already
have awesome cans and average consumers
are complaining that they don't really
see the point or the value the benefits
that these do have is that they
naturally won't fall off the headset so
if you're whipping your head around in
something like eval Curry you're safe
and it's also been claimed that it's a
benefit to the developer to know exactly
the performance capabilities of what
headset you will be using they know the
volume they can push out they know the
quality of the sound etc profiles for
these included headphones are set
within the SDK and whether or not anyone
will notice these benefits is yet to be
seen but I'm not writing them off quite
yet
the sensors have also had a significant
improvement you can really tell when
trying out the device because the bounds
are much wider and you don't hit them
nearly as much the LED layout on the
headset should make it so that you can
be facing any direction and still be
tracked by the sensor which you can tilt
just in case you want to stand if you're
playing a game like bullet train which
by the way is super freakin fun an
improvement to the overall accuracy of
the sensor design will come later on
down the line when you add the oculus
touch this will happen not because the
sensor will get better but because
you'll add an additional sensor the
touch is oculus is approach to VR input
and it's two independent controllers one
per hand which is meant to make it feel
like your VR hands are well your real
hands not like you're just holding a
tool punching things throwing things
flicking things all of this should feel
natural they even have a grip button so
when you're holding something you'll
naturally be holding the controller more
tightly they even have you covered if
you want to make obscene hand gestures
or just give a thumbs up because the
thumb stick and the trigger buttons both
have capacitive tops and can feel if
you've lifted off of them or not next up
the vive HTC has been a lot more
tight-lipped in regards to their
headsets but I'll cover everything I can
hardware spec wise when looking at the
inside of the headset may seem a little
bit like deja vu 21 by 60 by 1200 split
across two screens OLED panel 90 Hertz
refresh rate and over a hundred degrees
of fov depending on how you wear it
easily one of the biggest improvements
that HTC brought to the table at CES was
improvements to the linen or dirty
window feel that the previous panels had
it was pretty rough with their earlier
prototypes much like it was with the
rift but I'm happy to say that it's
almost entirely gone now and looks great
the fit and finish has improved
dramatically for the vive and while
they're claiming that it actually isn't
any lighter than their previous
prototypes it definitely feels lighter
due to their improved weight
distribution by optimizing their head
straps no news on the interchangeability
of the foam or how easy it will be to
clean however HTC has now mounted a
camera on the front because someone
forgot
tell them it was a phone which actually
adds some pretty major improvements to
be honest their chaperone system which
previously just displayed the wall
boundaries that you set within the
program is now able to make a cool blue
outlined grid model of any objects that
are in the room so you don't have to
worry so much about moving around and
bumping something or breaking it or
falling over yourself one of the most
notable improvements with this is what's
being called the cat detection system
there is an actually specific system for
this but it does allow you to not worry
so much but stepping on something like
your cat or other small animal or really
anything well in VR which has admittedly
been a pretty huge issue the addition of
the camera was a serious step in the
right direction previous prototypes also
had big issues with occlusion or
essentially the blocking of various
sensors their lighthouse system sensors
either with your own body or something
else in the room or say one of the
controllers could be overlapping the
other one which would totally screw
things up resulting in controllers
teleporting all over the place and major
disconnects in terms of player
positioning HTC has made their
photodiode sensors more sensitive than
before change they layout on the headset
itself and done a massive overhaul to
the controller both in terms of how you
hold it and the layout and design of the
sensors the controller now sits in a
more consistent position in your hand
which is better for developers so they
have a more accurate idea of the exact
position and orientation of your hand
these Wiimote like wands also feature a
ring at the end which seems to be solely
there for tracking reasons as the ring
has no specific function other than
holding a large amount of those photo
diodes distributed all around the ring
this in combination with the improved
lighthouse sensors made a significant
and very noticeable improvement to the
tracking of the controllers now finally
how do they compare this is not an easy
thing to quantify even if they were
released they're both very similar yet
completely fundamentally different at
the same time their screen sound very
similar on paper yet they're
implementing them differently their
first party controllers are wildly
different and controller alone has been
enough of a reason for gamers to decide
differently between consoles in the past
they're sensing and motion technology
are very different implementations as
well making the experience totally
different on each version well you can
stand and walk around with an oculus
rift and you can sit in one place with
an HTC vive they're both targeting
different experiences I have personally
never gone through a vive demo that was
stationary in any way and I have
personally never gone through an oculus
demo that had me move around a space
that was any bigger than two yoga mats
in games like bullet train rift users
can teleport a short distance then fight
from a pivot point instead of walking
around which in theory allows you to
travel through levels relatively
naturally vive has a leg up here however
by having a larger walking area which
would support the idea of teleporting
and I haven't seen this at all
implemented yet but considering they're
partnered with valve would allow you to
do things like walking through a portal
to get to your next area speaking of
larger walking area both have issues
with constantly tethered cables but it
is much more of an issue with the vive
being mobile and having a cable near
neck height isn't great
the rift demos no one really worries
about the cable because it's never
really an issue and vive demos it is
very common for a dedicated person to be
walking around just managing the cable
that's crazy and not going to be an
option for many people watching someone
play a game is one thing being someone's
cable boy is another there are people
actively working on this like gigabyte
horas with their backpack which we
checked out here or even Intel who's
working with partners like Horus to
deliver these types of backpacks which
are great and Intel has some amazing
ideas coming down the pipe which should
make them even better which I can't talk
about yet but this still requires you to
have a super-powerful laptop or
superlight computer capable of running
games at 90 FPS minimums
that's an expensive pill to swallow last
but not least is the controller and this
quite honestly is in your hands pun
intended I'm sorry let's move on this
like most controllers will come down to
personal preference once all is said and
done in my personal opinion which may
not matter too much here I prefer the
touch controllers the way you grip
things the fact that they wrap around
your hand and just how incredibly
natural they felt within a minute or two
of using them was a thing to behold
no one needed to tell me what buttons
did what I just naturally knew without
ever using controllers like these before
that's pretty freaking cool they didn't
feel like a magical virtual reality
enabling wand and honestly I quickly
forgot they were even really there they
became an extension of my movement a
part of my body this potential level of
immersion is very important for VR as a
whole looking at the VR landscape
altogether there are still many
challenges that need to be overcome the
uncanny valley of reproduced movement
and reverse kinematics of your own
bodies when looking at ourselves in a
virtual mirror or just looking down at
our virtual bodies will continue to be
an issue for a while there are major
differences between the controllers and
while this is a good thing in terms of
innovation competition and just in
general pushing the limits of the
platform there may need to be
standardization at some point and at
that point we will probably see a higher
adoption of VR speaking of higher
adoption VR hasn't had its Android
butter moment yet virtual reality still
lacks the Polish you find in most widely
adopted products it will come but I
don't think it's there yet then there's
the price the rift announced at six
hundred US dollars an understandable
price but still considerably higher than
we were led to believe the vibe has been
positioned as a premium VR headset this
whole time so I don't expect it to be
cheaper my guess is under a thousand
bucks probably closer to $8.99 or $9.99
although there's been some rumor mill
sites that have said 1500 I don't really
know if that's going to happen I don't
really think so while that may sound
expensive on its own another thing to
realize is that it's actually only part
of the Associated cost people haven't
honestly had a good reason to build
crazy badass computers for quite some
time now other than just wanting a crazy
badass computer which is totally fair
but the lack of games that really push
gamers to upgrade their PC has left the
PC market mostly saturated with slow old
machines happily chugging along in World
of Warcraft chemists right go and League
Legends that leaves the overall cost of
the platform incredibly high because
people are gonna have to upgrade a whole
bunch of stuff to get there and this
will hurt the average consumers ability
to adopt or
yawn which is probably fine actually I'd
rather us hardcores tried it while the
other people just waited because I'd
rather that we fought with the rough
edges now than have a massive amount of
people trying it assuming it's not ready
and dooming the platform but it does
suck for the hard course that can't
afford it I've been waiting for this for
a long time so I've been saving but some
people haven't or are not able to and
that really sucks ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
don't speak to a robot they put you
directly through to a person and you
only use or you only pay for what you
use the average ting bill is only $24 a
month per device which is pretty sweet
pretties read if you're stuck in a
contract they'll help you switch over to
ting by covering 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 so head over
to lioness ENCOM and try out their
savings calculator when you sign up on
our link you'll also get $25 in service
credit or $25 towards a new device

from unbox therapy to try some demos
from my development kit too and make
some interesting predictions about the
