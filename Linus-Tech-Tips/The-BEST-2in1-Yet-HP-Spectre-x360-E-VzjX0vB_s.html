would need a computer smaller thinner or
lighter than a razor blade and then Huck
I got a small procedure to ensure that I
wouldn't have any more children and the
doc was all like yo dog you can't lift
anything for a bit so I was all like
well hey how about this Spectre x-360
2017 two and one from HP and then he was
like okay that looks pretty light
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description some notebooks even
ones that I like managed to use premium
materials and solid internal hardware
and still feel like a compromise because
at some point a designer figured that
that extra millimeter or that
cool-looking hidden hinge was worth
whatever we were sacrificing not the
spectre x360 2017 I've rarely seen such
a marriage of beautiful design and
pragmatism the machined aluminum chassis
is light enough to keep the entire
device under three pounds and 14
millimeters thick but both the base and
the display hold up shockingly well to
my twist test with battery life coming
in well over four hours in my usual PC
mark work test a very strong result and
the core i7 7500 u dual-core could be
cooled passively
but instead we get ventilation intakes
along the bottom and a side exhaust that
stayed practically silent under light
workloads while still allowing the
processor to stretch its legs to 3.1
gigahertz under heavy multi-threaded
loads
since we're under the hood the rest of
the hardware specs are what what are
they exactly well mine has a 256 gig
nvme SSD eight gigs of ram onboard
graphics and a 72% color gamut whatever
that means
1080p multi-touch IPS display that I
would describe as pretty good but the
product page for this thing tries to be
everything to everyone
and just ends up being really confusing
there's talk of optional 4k displays
optional micro edge displays dual or
quad speakers why does the bigger model
have only two speakers is that better
and then in that case why is four
speakers a selling point
got a sales pitch for nvidia graphics
cards with a blurb under it explaining
that the 13.3 inch is only available
with intel iris plus onboard graphics
and they managed to get all of that
stuff on there without mentioning the
outstanding mix of i/o on the left is a
type a USB 3 port a three-and-a-half
millimeter combo jack and a power button
it's easy to reach in laptop tablet or
anything in between mode and on the
right we've got volume control and the
frak Thunderbolt 3 how did to
Thunderbolt 3 ports not make it into the
marketing materials
I had to confirm for myself by hooking
up to a razor cord that they are
actually Thunderbolt 3 and not just fast
charging type-c ports with the confusing
graphic on them and they are it worked
completely seamlessly out of the box
with the core and managed to handle an
all night gaming stress test in rise of
the Tomb Raider flawlessly and there's
more good news
some may object to the thicker top and
bottom bezels but this is that function
merged with form thing again the top is
thick because it rocks a decent 1080p
webcam with wait for it
ir emitters for windows hello my
favorite feature ever and the antennas
for the 2 by 2 Wi-Fi that performs
admirably and the bottom is to lift the
display off the desk a little bit
meaning less neck strain and give a
little more depth to the product for the
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers that are and you
can quote me on this the best I've heard
yet on a thin and light I'm not sure how
they did it but they found great the
keyboard and trackpad are a couple of
mixed bags for me though the feel of
both is outstanding thanks to nice long
travel distances with satisfying tactile
feedback on the keys and the glass top
for the trackpad but there are some
design choices that I disagree with here
the widescreen aspect ratio of the
trackpad is great and both the track
acceleration algorithm and palm
rejection are top-notch but the click
pad has a very inconsistent feel from
the top to the bottom that's hard to
forgive now that Apple force touch
exists as for the keyboard it's
off-center seemingly to make room for
dedicated keys for functions that I
prefer to have combined with function
arrows anyway and this misalignment
forces your shoulders or your neck out
of whack which is kind of a bummer
because aside from that and the couple
of QC issues with my sample listen to
this it's one of my favorite laptop
keyboards to date so conclusion time
then at the price this kind of build
quality would have been unthinkable a
couple of years ago the spectre x360
2017 proves that - and ones are all
grown up now and you can get a hell of
an ultraportable computer starting at
900 bucks you know what else you could
get for 900 bucks
