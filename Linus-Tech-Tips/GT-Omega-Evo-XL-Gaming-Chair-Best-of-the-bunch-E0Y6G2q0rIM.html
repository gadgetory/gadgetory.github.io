evo XL is an evolution of the gaming
chair market I'm sorry we can move on
now if you haven't seen our other chair
videos click wherever they are
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click now to learn more let's start with
the unboxing experience the GT Omega evo
XL comes in a box that seems from the
outside at least very similar to the
other gaming chairs we've checked out
it's big brown and fairly nondescript
outside of a few logos but when you open
it up a different experience begins
through the material that they use is a
synthetic leather they have fooled me
with the enticing scent that emanates
from the box when you start removing
pieces something actually took me by
surprise when I first saw the back of
the chair is that GT Omega took the time
to embroider our logo on both the front
and back of the chair obviously this
isn't going to be a true everyday Evo XL
it arrives to customers doors and it
certainly didn't affect the outcome of
the review but I thought it was a pretty
nice touch as a removed pieces from the
box one thought kept crossing my mind
this chair seems very well built from
the heavy metal basis to the nice
feeling leathery pleather e-materials
throughout the chair and the actually
soft plastic armrests to the chrome
accents on everything it just felt nice
now on to my favorite part of the
unboxing experience the vast amount of
bolts other than two of the screws
required to assemble the chair were
pre-installed into their holes this was
such a relief as it meant that I would
not be dealing with manufacturing
tolerance issues between the holes and
material and the holes in the chair
itself as I had in the past on top of
that all the pre-installed bolts were
threaded as thumb screws making
installation a breeze and they even
included the proper allen keys for each
bolt in order to tighten it so I began
the assembly process absolutely tickled
pink with the GT Omega evo XL the first
few segments went off without a major
hitch one note for assembly is that it
is much easier to install the top to the
bottom joint on the left side of the
chair first as it doesn't carry the
hefty tilt mechanism and you can stall
the right side first but I found it much
more difficult to line up the hole
on that side and the chair itself due to
the increased strain on that side from
the tilt mechanism with the left side
installed the right side went in very
easily and I was off to the races in
completing the Assembly of my new racing
chair but that is unfortunately where
the fun stopped one pretty significant
issue with our evo XL actually didn't
come with an instruction sheet up until
this point it was no issue it was pretty
much paint-by-numbers so to speak and I
was actually enjoying the assembly
process but the lift control base mount
thing caused a bit of an issue
once again the bolts were pre-installed
but the installation process wasn't
entirely clear the right and left levers
for lift located at the bottom of the
mechanism are labeled with a very light
are an alt text to indicate left and
right but the layout doesn't make a ton
of sense which resulted in us swapping
the pieces orientation a few times and
is kind of frustrating with the lift
control base mount installed I was able
to finish up the rest of the base
installation without much trouble and
move on to the finishing touches
unfortunately though they did send us to
left joint covers oh man the lack of
instruction manual was one thing but the
inclusion of two left arm covers rather
than a right and a left really
disappointed me as it resulted in the
ugly tilt mechanism on the right side of
the chair being completely uncovered due
to omega apologized for the air and
overnight at a right joint cover as soon
as we informed them but it doesn't
change the fact that it wasn't in the
original shipping container so on to the
actual user experience overall I found
the chair quite comfortable
the cushions firmly support me while
still providing enough to give me a
relaxing sitting experience the armrests
are highly adjustable and very close to
if not the same arm rests on the max
anomic chair line has checked out a few
months ago which you can see here the
chair leans back easily making it quite
solid choice for those who want to kick
it and watch a movie or even game stream
in front of their PC or somewhere else
in addition to gaming but the chair is
certainly not perfect and lastly the
wings
I'm personally still not a huge fan of
these as I don't think they make a ton
of sense for a very
moving gaming experience where you're
not being jostled around like you would
be in a car which they were designed for
and I find it more restricting than
anything else to have them there
especially up high in the shoulders
I have relatively wide shoulders and I
find it quite annoying for them to be
curved forward but if this is something
you're looking for I must admit it
wasn't all that bad of an implementation
and it's not going to make my back sore
like other chairs in this category so
conclusion time the GT Omega evo XL is
quite honestly the closest one of these
gaming chairs that felt like a
legitimate racing chair seat from a car
to me at least it's comfortable
relatively well built and seems to be
produced with the fairly good
manufacturing tolerances with its
overall design being pretty well
thought-out but for my personal daily
driver I'm not entirely sure there's
this one there's the max now I make
those two are both pretty high up or
we're still yet to review some of the
more comfy couch style poufy chairs and
I don't necessarily think I'm decided
yet what's your favorite gaming chair
