1080p I breaking down the hills which to
implanting a new-build 1080 should I
wait for wagons a graphic and a GTX any
for rx Vega wait for Navi so a GTC last
year we expected to get AMD Vega in
early 2017 but as the slide helpfully
points out the time line was subject to
change and change it did it is now
August but today we finally find out was
Vega worth the wait
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description
meet Vega or more accurately RX vega 56
and 64 the consumer versions of the vega
founders excuse me
frontier edition cards that launched
back in June of this year it's named for
the number of next-gen compute units on
board if we compare it against the
frontier edition we can see that we're
on par for compute units on Vega 64 but
we've got about half the video memory at
eight gigs and our clocks are a little
lower much lower in Vega 56 is case but
like that card and one of the likely
reasons behind the delays they both have
HBM to memory the newest revision of the
blazing-fast memory that first debuted
on AMD's own fury cards back in 2015
which both does and doesn't feel like a
long time ago depending on how you look
at it anyway aside from actually
basically everything new to Vega is a
tile based rendering mode that AMD calls
the draw stream binning rasterizer a
feature similar to what nvidia
implemented on maxwell that AMD tells us
will improve performance without any
extra work from game developers let's
meet the lineup for today we've got Vega
56 both air and liquid cooled flavors of
rx Vega 64 and the gtx 1070 and 1080
that their pricing puts them up against
and we'll be treating all three cards to
our mainstream gaming platforms from
both the red team and the blue team at
the top end we immediately see the Vega
64 liquid cooled card pull out into a
comfortable lead though this quickly
changes in rise of the Tomb Raider where
the GTX 1080 over runs it moving a
teardown while the Vega 56 significantly
widens and closes these gaps on the 1070
at times appearing like a kind of 1070
TI this theme of trading blows seems to
take place across all of our gaming
benchmarks
Mark's and our synthetics tell a similar
tale if you're an AMD fan who wanted to
see competition you're going to be happy
but if you wanted AMD to blow the doors
off Nvidia well you might be a little
disappointed you'll be more excited
about the productivity applications in
Cinebench r15 blender and Adobe Media
encoder we see a clear trend favoring
even the air-cooled rx mega64
over the GTX 1080 something that we're
not entirely surprised by but we're
happy to see considering AMD's
traditional strengths in general purpose
CPU tasks unfortunately another point of
divergence is power consumption the RX
Vega 64 is an absolute hog when it comes
to power to say nothing at the liquid
cooled version and thermal performance
isn't much better for the air-cooled
Vegas Explorer either with the heaviest
throttle out of any of the cards we
tested you actually need both 8 pin
power connectors for these cards ouch
with that said the value proposition
here is still pretty compelling our
air-cooled rx Vega 64 is quite close to
the gtx 1080 founders edition in gaming
while the liquid cooled variant is a
better performer but one that's
ultimately held back a little by its
higher price tag for productivity and
gpgpu bill rx Vega really shines
of course the same is true of the
excellent productivity performance of rx
Vega at 56 but the real story is gaming
holy balls we're actually doing pretty
great at this price especially since we
couldn't even find a gtx 1070 for less
than about four hundred and thirty
dollars though with that sense the value
argument of the entire Vega lineup is
pretty complicated because the higher
end cards may not be purchasable without
AMD's value added bundles so we're
talking a discount on a rise in seven a
free sync monitor and some free games
that seems to add about a hundred
dollars to the price though AMD says
it's worth $420 so the question really
becomes Vegas 56 looks pretty good with
or without the bundle depending on
whether you want that stuff that's part
of AMD strategy to deter coin miners
from buying these cards but at the very
high end the Vegas 64 liquid cooled at
$6.99 with rebates and games that one
becomes a tougher sell but feel free to
tell us if we're wrong in the comments
below so conclusion then the wait is
finally over
Vega might bear more similarity to the
performance and power consumption
profile of invidious last generation
Maxwell architecture when it comes to
gaming tasks but the good news is that
it's enough to be in the conversation
for high end GPU buyers and those poor
folks with high resolution freesync
monitors that now finally have a real
option for a graphics card to drive them
the only thing remaining then is to see
what NVIDIA has up their sleeves with
volta synergy it's symbiosis it's energy
it's a software product that lets you
solve the problem once and for all of
having two keyboards and two mice
because you can share one Mouse and one
keyboard between multiple computers so
whatever your reason for having more
than one computer laptop and desktop
you know Linux workstation and Windows
machine for gaming or Mac or whatever it
works on everything it's amazing you
just install synergy and you just
seamlessly move your mouse between the
computers Wow
they've got basic and pro options with a
one-time payment and advanced features
include things like clipboard sharing
between the computers for easy cut paste
dragging and dropping files between
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and more and the best part is you can
use our link in the video description to
get 50% off synergy today
so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit the like
button get subscribed maybe consider
checking out where to find the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
