thought we'd shoot it in kind of a
random location I'm actually just
lounging on the balcony outside my
office my desk is on the other side of
this wall
so this balcony oversees the warehouse
operations here at NCIX
anyway I recently uploaded a video to my
other channel where we took the camera
man's computer and we upgraded it with
an SSD featuring trim and Windows 7 so I
got a few messages asking me what
exactly is trim and why did you
emphasize so many times that that was
important and that it was a key feature
of Windows 7
well first of all Windows 7 is the only
operating system right now that does
feature trim support so they're put that
in your pipe and smoke it that's why
it's important but that doesn't actually
answer the question the question is what
does trim do so here's what trim does I
devised this some example trim is kind
of like the insert key because normally
with any SSD drive the performance is
actually going to degrade as soon as you
take that fresh never written flash
memory and write over at once every time
you try to write it's like this so even
after you delete a file in clear space
if you want to rewrite that H you
actually have to delete it first which
takes up one cycle and then you have to
write to it after so it takes a lot
longer
what trim does is it's a way of the
operating system telling your drive
whenever you delete a file immediately
hey that bit isn't there anymore so you
can just right right over that so it
clears it out right away so it's kind of
like the insert key if I press the
insert key and you know I want to write
something over this well it helps if I
type correctly then what it does is it
enables you to write data without first
removing it and it really increases the
speed and the performance of your SSD
especially over time now there are other
solutions like garbage collection but
trim really is the most elegant solution
because all you do is pop it into your
system and forget about it keeps your
SSD running in tip-top shape</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
