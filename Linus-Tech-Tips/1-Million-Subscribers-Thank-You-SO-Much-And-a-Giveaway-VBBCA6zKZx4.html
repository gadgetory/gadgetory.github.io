ultimate ddr4 memory with speeds of up
to three thousand three hundred and
thirty three megahertz available click
now to learn more so this is it today
we passed the 1 million subscriber mark
but without getting too wrapped up in
the excitement about you know gold
YouTube play buttons and that kind of
stuff
there are some other really cool numbers
to two hundred million views 4.8 million
likes 1.8 million comments a hundred
thousand members of the Linus tech tips
community site twenty five hundred
videos over thirteen hundred years of
collective time spent watching Linus
tech tips videos seven members of the
Linus tech tips
Linus Media Group production team and
three channels now with daily bi-weekly
and weekly content we have come a long
way and it is all thanks to you guys are
amazing viewers so I put together some
pretty awesome giveaways to celebrate
but first its old men reminiscing time
so when I first started this channel I
was working at NCI exa it's an awesome
computer store in Canada and Linus tech
tips was meant to be complementary to
the official NCIX YouTube channel that
had already been working on for over a
year basically I wanted somewhere to put
stuff like leaked information about
unreleased products or products that
really didn't deserve their own
dedicated video on the main channel and
where I could let my personality out a
little bit without worrying too much
about how to reflect on the company
image so the initial format lasted for a
matter of like weeks because and I
legitimately don't remember whose idea
this was but I got a new performance
target and the goal was to do daily
videos I mean it's totally insane now
that I look back at it so early in the
process I remember cameraman and I the
original cameraman taking an entire
week's worth of content in this case it
was like 6p 55 motherboards from MSI and
gigabyte and unboxing them on a park
bench in one afternoon outside the
office so that day in August 2009 just
over five years ago the one take policy
was devised as
a way for us to achieve that daily video
goal and then from then on we tried to
do every product unboxing in one take
mostly to save on editing time sometimes
it hurt the quality of the video I'd
make a mistake or forget something or
the product demo wouldn't work but I
think it added a charming human element
and some unpredictability to what was
otherwise pretty dry subject matter I
wish that I could say that I was some
kind of YouTube genius who premeditated
all this stuff but honestly at the time
I didn't know what was gonna happen in a
Linus tech tips video I mean here's an
SSD that I unboxed standing on top of my
then girlfriend now wife's bed because
the weather sucked outside and there was
nowhere else to film and I had a video
due that night anyway that went on for
some time until almost two years ago now
I realized it was time to leave NCIX and
start my own company dedicated to just
Linus tech tips and my other video
projects Linus Media Group was born so
Real Talk time my team and I went all in
on Linus media group the first two
members of my team Luke and Etzel both
changed their education plans to do this
with me and I spent just about every
penny that I had saved over the previous
six years supporting the business for
the first three to four months until it
started being able to stand on its own
but the investment paid off with more
time to spend on making videos and a
team that has since grown to include
seven people as I alluded to before
we've been able to produce what I think
is some of the highest quality
Technology content on YouTube and we've
done it without ever compromising on
that daily upload schedule so I'm
extremely thankful to my team for
helping us get to this milestone but
even more than that I'm thankful to you
guys I mean the viewers out there who
are watching this right now without your
support we would not have made it I knew
I was going to have to find ways to
monetize our content beyond Google
Adsense so that I could pay people a
living wage and cover my own overhead
but I didn't know how you guys would
react and I'm I'm so thankful that that
you've continued to be supportive all
this time because thanks to you guys I
think I have one of the coolest jobs in
the world and I get to work with the
coolest group of people in the world and
I guess speaking of sponsorships before
I reveal the big giveaway this is
great time to also thank our sponsors
because without them this whole thing
also wouldn't work so today's sponsors
audible.com normally I talk about how
they have over 150,000 audiobooks and
gone girl by Gillian Flynn is a
seriously mind screwy but awesome ride I
actually just finished it and how you
should go to audible.com slash Linus and
sign up for their monthly audiobook
membership and all that stuff but I mean
come on you guys know what audible is so
if you want to listen to an audiobook go
there they have like everything no today
I'd rather talk about the way that
they've supported Linus Media Group as
well they were the first non PC hardware
sponsor that began working with us and
that relationship actually opened up a
lot of doors for us to other non-pc
sponsors who saw what audible was doing
and thought hey maybe this could work
for us too so today is more about thanks
audible.com the bottom of my heart I
appreciate what you guys have done and I
hope my viewers feel the same way and
recommend audible to their friends and
family for allowing small business
owners like me to do what we love
alright so let all that out of the way
like cheer up here what am i giving away
to celebrate a few different things
actually first up is the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 that I reviewed in this
video here Austin's got it right now I
think he's working on something with it

winners new notebook tablet surface

built and shipped to you by me

graffiti'd by me and the rest of the
linus media group team including signing
it and writing whatever we want on it it

done but for one lucky winner it will at
least be your ass and finally the line
