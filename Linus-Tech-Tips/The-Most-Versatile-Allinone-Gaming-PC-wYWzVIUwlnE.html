you by D brand maker of perfectly fitted
skins for laptops phones and other
devices check them out at D brand comm /
line of CES ok normally my policy at
these shows is I don't talk about
anything that's already been released
but this one's only been out for like 11
days and it's pretty freaking cool we've
seen gaming grade all-in-one computers
before but this one ticks an awful lot
of boxes for me and it is not something
that I could easily ignore it's sitting
at the l√©gion by Lenovo table here but
because it was launched before they
formally unveiled the brand it is still
in lenovo idea center a ioy 9/10 so it
sits awkwardly between the engineering
that they're doing to make an amazing
gaming machine and the branding that
just needed a little bit of time to
catch up
so this puppy rocks a 27-inch 2560 by
1440 144 Hertz freesync
IPS display so it is one of the first a
iOS I've seen that legitimately has the
kind of display that I would hook up to
and up to core i7 6 gen processor and up
to GT x 1080 graphics card it can also
do up to 32 gigs of ram up to 256 gigs
of SSD and 2 terabyte worth of hard
drive based storage in the
pre-configured models it's got built-in
killer doubleshot Pro land and Wi-Fi
it's got a headphone holder over on the
left boom it's got a real sense pop-up
webcam up here so that's that whole
background removal thing that Intel's
been working on for a little while in
terms of i/o it's got USB 3 it's got an
SD card reader it's got an optical drive
so if you still use CDs it's got pretty
much the whole kit and kaboodle but the
thing that really got my attention with
this guy is that they legitimately want
people to upgrade it easily so they
actually threw a model out here for us
that we could play around with so
there's your memory slots you want to
upgrade your memory
you just go ahead you rip that bad boy
out yeah I mean if you got big fingers
it might be a little bit tough but go
ahead throw something else in there no
problem GPU you undo this screw right
here slide it over come on come on baby
there we go
all yes and there you go so all the
display stuff that goes on in here is
just run by these internal cables that
you could feasibly plug into any video
card you wanted so this model right here
is running a gtx 1070 but they've left
the extra connectors if you wanted to
put something beefier in down the road
pretty freakin cool
last cool thing about it is that they've
got a monitor only switch thank you very
much
Lenovo for that now when the computer
five years from now is going to be
replaced by something a little bit more
up-to-date you could still use it as a
144 Hertz IPS freesync display very nice
so pricing starts on this thing at
$12.99 for a core i5 and a gtx 1060 and
unlike a lot of the stuff we're seeing
at the show it is actually available
today very cool
so thanks for checking out this video
from the Lenovo booth get subscribed and
a huge shout-out to our sponsor D brand
