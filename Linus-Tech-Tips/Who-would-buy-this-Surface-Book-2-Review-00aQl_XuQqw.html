was pretty awesome but arguably a little
thick and a little underpowered so we
were thrilled when we found out that the
surface book 2 would pair its quad core
processor with a beefy GTX 1060 graphics
card but how could it do that given its
detachable design and is some extra
power worth the price and some of its
questionable design choices well you'll
know the answer very soon after I thank
glasswire for sponsoring this video

below
the build quality of the surface book -
meets expectations which is to say that
like the rest of its family it is
spectacular the magnesium body has this
soft texture to it and no matter where
you touch it it feels solid and well
crafted
it's even got a decent helping of IO
with finally a type C port this is a
first first surface product but it's
also not all good while you can use it
to charge the device if you forget your
magnetic charger and if you have a
powerful enough wall board its regular
USB 3 not Thunderbolt 3 which means no
external graphics or premium docks
unless Microsoft were to start selling
an upgraded keyboard bottom with like a
better GPU inside it and the surface
book 2 is pretty heavy and unwieldly
by 2018 standards as a Windows tablet
it's big and it's pretty but it
sacrifices nearly all of its i/o and as
a laptop it's not very laughable because
so much of the weight is up top in the
tablet portion overall we feel like this
detachable approach offers questionable
utility compared to folding devices like
Dells upcoming XPS 15 2 &amp;amp; 1 and the
hinge also adds considerable thickness
something that Porsche Design was able
to overcome however you might be able to
forgive the extra bulk because of its
raw power rocking an Intel Core i7
8650 you 16 gigs of ram and a gtx 1050
in the 13 inch model or gtx 1060 in the
15 inch the surface book 2 is going to
be great for productivity but also even
for proper photo or even video editing
plus real triple-a games at full details
that is assuming everything stays nice
and cool which is mostly the case so
after an hour stress testing both laptop
cpus were nice
and cool unless the battery was charging
at the same time and it should be noted
they sacrificed some performance in any
case leveling off under their 1.9
gigahertz base clock so this will affect
the export time of a video project for
example but it makes sense since a large
consideration was the touch temperature
of the device and I still prefer this
proactive approach to apples where they
just let the processor run as fast as it
can and thermal throttle a quick side
note here our review ended up delayed
because our first unit was part of a
small batch with terrible thermals this
isn't normal so if your results are
different from what we're showing
contact Microsoft and get it sorted out
moving on the surface book 215 inches as
we mentioned before surprisingly well
equipped compared to other notebooks
that aren't explicitly designed for
gaming so if you want to run older
titles you can do it at native res or if
you drop down to 1080p it can handle
just about anything with the 13 and a
half inch model also performing
respectively with all of that said if
you're just gaming you could get the
same power in an Acer Helios 300 for a
third of the price you get a surface
book 2 for the productivity that is
where it excels pardon the pun the
surface book 2 absolutely nails the
keyboard feel compared to any other
laptop we've tried it's as good or
better with a nice travel distance soft
yet tactile keystrokes and a nice soft
comfortable surface coating since people
will ask yes it's a lot better than the
MacBook Pro well at least as far as the
keyboard is concerned the touchpad is a
different story
Apple's large gesture friendly touch
surface still stands above anything
available in the PC space though that's
not to say that the one here is bad and
I guess if you're really focused on
comparing size the 15-inch display
offers plenty of real estate to get your
touch on as you'd expect the surface
book 2 is right up there with the best
touch experiences on the market
so if you'll be using the stylus for
notes or drawing you can't really do
better while maintaining a full fat x86
operating system and the screen isn't
just good for touching it's also
fantastic to look at with Microsoft
individual factory calibration making
sure that every color hits your eyeballs
just right furthermore as we've said
about every surface product the three by
two aspect ratio coupled with the higher
resolution is noticeably better for
productivity than sixteen by nine 1080p
and you'll be able to be productive for
a really long time thanks to the book
two's over nine and a half our score in
our work battery test this is among the
best results that we've seen to date its
webcam is better than other laptops
which is to say that it's still probably
not as good as cameras should be in 2018
but progress is progress but it makes up
for some of that with Windows hello
facial recognition and some pretty good
speakers given its size
so overall good maybe even great but as
always there's a catch it got a 1 out of
10 for repairability for my fix it so
you've got a shell out up front for the
specs you think you'll need even storage
and our top-of-the-line model here will
run you a cool 3300 US dollars ouch now
if you compare that to another premium
product like the MacBook Pro well I'd
say as long as you can live without Mac
OS the surface book tube comes away the
clear winner thanks to its superior
versatility but if you don't need one
device that does everything the price is
a little tough to swallow I mean yes
technically it starts at $1,500 but that
one has no dedicated graphics card and
only two CPU cores making a surface pro
or a surface laptop easier on both your
wallet and your back speaking of making
things easier why not switch to ting
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction first so when you call ting
you do not speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and you
don't pay extra for the privilege you
pay only for the data and the airtime
that you use with the average ting bill
coming in at just 23 bucks a month per
device and if you're stuck in a contract
and switch to ting they'll even cover
25% of your cancellation fee up to 75
bucks
they've got lower mobile data rates than
ever it's now just $10 a gig beyond the
first gig and every single tank customer
will be able to reap the benefits of
this new change so head over to Linus
ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator to see if you'll save and
then when you sign up at our link make
sure that you get the 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
that you get that's Linus ting comm so
