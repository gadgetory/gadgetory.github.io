like this since CES 2014 I mean not
quite like this more on that later but
ZOTAC still a lot closer to my vision
for the ultimate compact PC than anyone
elses this is the Magnus en 980 though
tax most powerful mini PC yet boasting a
core i5 quad-core processor a full-fat
gtx 980 graphics core with four gigs of
vram and liquid cooling all in the size
of a shoebox
mass drop is featuring the whitefox
keyboard it's available in 4 plate
layouts and comes complete with Cherry
compatible key caps check it and other
drops out at the link in the video
description so let's start with a look
at this puppy physically the design of
the en 9 ad reminds me more of ZOTAC
speak OPI 320 micro PC then of the
similarly named en 970 the bottom is
white maybe this was borrowed from the
SN 970 steam machine with small vents
around the outside edges and a couple of
product information stickers adorning it
the top is a white plastic honeycomb
with a tighter powder blue mesh behind
it that gives it a distinctive if not
particularly high performance look and
all of the sides are constructed from
thick blasted anodized aluminum at the
front you'll be greeted by a power
button and SDXC reader 2 USB 3.1 ports
one type a and another type C and two
audio jacks for headphones and
microphone which regrettably aren't
replicated on the back a frustrating
thing for people who use standalone
speakers not headphones and want their
desk to look clean also on the back
you'll be greeted by two Wi-Fi antennas
two gigabit ethernet connections to each
of HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2 video
outputs four USB 3.0 ports thank
goodness I thought we were going to have
two of everything and damnit it happened
again two DC inputs whoa yes my friends
the Magnus en 980 includes not one but
two 180 watt power bricks to provide
enough juice for the shockingly powerful
hardware that it carries within its gut
let's go through that then shall we at
its heart is a desktop core i5 6400 2.7
gigahertz skylake quad core that turbos
up to three point three gigahertz and a
desktop grade MXM form factor nvidia
geforce gtx 980 with four gigs of VRAM
there installed on a completely custom
motherboard with support for a single m2
SSD a single two-and-a-half inch SSD or
hard drive and up
to to sodium slots for ddr3l memory that
offer official support for up to 16 gigs
of ram total but that i tested with our
intelligent memory modules and found
will actually work just fine with up to
32 gigs if you can get your hands on 16
gig sticks so why then external power
supplies well there are two things I've
ignored so far number one is the
magnesium 980 size at a mere five point
eight five liters it is smaller than the
den case a for SFX by about 20 percent
and it's even smaller than the MSI
vortex and while it doesn't have two
graphics cards like the vortex number
two is that it has a freaking water
cooler inside oMG right now some
configurations of the Magnus will come
with RAM and drives and an operating
system pre-installed while others like
mine will just have empty bays there's
great news though they are astonishingly
easy to get at I was about to get
started
realize I didn't have a screwdriver ran
downstairs for my trusty iFixit kit then
ran back upstairs only to realize that
the rubber feet on the bottom of the
case are fun screws and everything is
right there brilliant this does raise
some questions about airflow and dust
accumulation however because I actually
don't see how those bottom vents are
really going everywhere and every panel
other than the top and above the i/o on
the rear is solid metal let's dig deeper
the front and rear panels come off with
a handful of Phillips screws to reveal
really no further insight about where
ZOTAC expects cooling for components
like the SSD and the motherboard chipset
to come from but we do get a much better
look at the liquid cooler they actually
managed to cram a full sized 120
millimeter radiator and 25 mil thick fan
along with a vibration dampened
low-profile pump a reservoir that's an
odd one most pre sealed units forego
this and custom cooling blocks for both
the CPU and GPU this was an expensive
product to develop I will tell
you that much but so was this
monstrosity in all likelihood
so cost clearly won't save a bad idea
let's find out if the en 980 was a bad
idea first up is thermals surprisingly
likely due to their inexperience dealing
with those little wannabe toasters we
call enthusiast graphics cards even
large multinational companies can screw
up cooling even in a mid tower that
several times the size of this guy but
whether it's thanks to zou tax
experience building video cards or
building mini pcs the en 980 not only
avoids thermal throttling even after a
prolonged synthetic stress test it
manages to keep both the CPU and GPU
under 70 degrees not to mention the SSD
is well within reason and stay as quiet
as a full-size Tower with good coolers
installed definitely suitable for use in
any space provided you've got ample
breathing room above the top exhaust so
given that then these benchmarks
shouldn't come as any surprise I mean
yes the GTX 1080 is out but the GTX 980
is no slouch and when it's not being
firmly limited is going to be able to
fully stretch its legs now of course our
performance testing doesn't include any
real VR titles I'm sorry about that
Luke is actually working on a video
about some of the challenges associated
with VR benching but in the meantime I
can personally vouch for the GTX 980 s
viability as a VR card given that that's
what I run in the living room vive
set-up that I was showing off on
Instagram a couple of weeks ago which
leads us to the answer to the question I
posed a couple of minutes ago was the en
980 a bad idea a super tiny VR capable
gaming PC with liquid cooling and the
thing I've been asking for external
power supply perfect for the living room
where I suspect a lot of people's VR
setups are going to end up where quiet
operation and sleek looks are huge
factors seems pretty awesome to me but
there are a couple of oversights that
I'd like to see corrected next time as
well because let's face it in a
bare-bones can
duration this is a 1600 US dollar
product I mean holy actual math Batman
number one is minor hdmi 1.4 guys really
I mean okay yes I can use this 25 dollar
Club 3d adapter to convert DisplayPort
to HDMI to but I shouldn't have to
number two on the other hand is pretty
significant the Magnus en 980 is not
user upgradeable outside of the drives
in RAM ZOTAC tells me that is very
difficult to take apart and that the
users warranty will be voided I mean
honestly I don't mind locking in the CPU
but Quick Connect fittings and a
commitment to make upgraded graphics
card kits available would take this
thing from very difficult to recommend
like the msi vortex to a much more
reasonable long-term solution for
ballers like the msi gt80 titan with
that said value calculations aside this
is one of the coolest pcs that I've ever
laid my hands on and I'm in awe of what
ZOTAC has achieved here great job you
guys
and great job to Phoenix who we've
partnered with again to give away five
well this looks like six but apparently
five of their newly launched Vitesse
gaming mice some of the features of this
mouse include it's a vago 3310 optical
sensor it's ergonomic design I can
imagine a mouse with no economic design
that'd be terrible it's 90 gram weight
if you don't include the cable it's on
runs which is on the fly dpi adjustments
a maximum dpi are 5000 dpi unit which is
dpi and LED indicators to display what
dpi setting you're at also for one lucky
winner will be giving away an entire
gaming suite of Phoenix products which
is pretty sweet if you think about it
that will include one Vitesse Mouse I
guess that's where the other one comes
in oops
one demora mousepad one Aria headset and
one auteur keyboard you can enter by
following Phoenix over on Twitter and
checking out the link to our community
forum in the video description so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or check out the link to where to
buy

video description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
