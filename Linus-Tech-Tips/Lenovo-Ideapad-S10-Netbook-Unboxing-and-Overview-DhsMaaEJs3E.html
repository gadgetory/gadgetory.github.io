should've checked so we have a Lenovo
IdeaPad s10 here which is supposed to be
the next big thing in subnotebooks so we
are going to open it up it features an
Intel Atom processor 512 Meg's of RAM 80
gig magnetic hard drive Windows XP a
10.2 inch LCD display and it comes in a
box that is rated for 2.5 5 no twenty
five point five pounds per inch of edge
crush so that's very very impressive
lenovo thank you inside we will find the
Lenovo s10 sub notebook we find a wow
that is a thick thick instruction manual
it's like really thick it's awesome
so this is what happens when I don't
press at all for things so then we've
got our accessory blocks which I'm going
to assume has yes the power adapter and
a battery so not much in the way of
accessories come with the s10 but stay
tuned we're going to open this baby up
and have a look so first impressions is
it is a little bit on the heavier side
for a sub notebook including the three
cell battery but it's also a little bit
bigger than those two the sub notes out
there so we're going to take off the
plastic covering here which is um held
on by masking tape very classy and we're
going to take off the little protective
plastic cover on the Lenovo logo which
is very shiny and very nice the finish
on this is kind of a matte black looks
like it's going to be a bit of a
fingerprint magnet but again that would
be a common theme for all of us oh this
is nice the inside has kind of a
traditional IBM matte black finish too
keys and to the whole interior of the
unit which has a bit of a sparkle to it
actually and we're going to take the
screen protector off here that is a very
classy looking little sub note so
there's actually little chromed accents
around the webcam as well as on the
power button I'm going to have a close
look at this keyboard this is one of the
better sub note keyboards we've seen yet
and I'm just going to test it out really
briefly here okay the one complaint
right off the bat first let me say it is
not a multilingual keyboard so if you
want an English only keyboard this will
do it for you however in my opinion the
shift key on this side should be a
little bit closer to the home row
instead of having an up arrow there the
left shift is quite comfortable and most
of the other keys are within comfortable
reach including the enter key and the
backspace as well as tab caps lock
anything else that you're going to need
so on the right side of the notebook
we've got Express card headphones
microphone USB and land with a
Kensington lock and then on the other
side of the notebook we've got a DC in
so that's for your your wall adapter
then you've got a VGA out an SD card and
one more USB port so the s10 does have
one fewer USB port than most of the
other sub notebooks that I've seen it
does have some other advantages as well
though such as the bottom plate from
here you can see that you can easily
access both the RAM and the hard drive
just by taking out two screws it's much
more user-friendly than some of the
other sub notebooks out there and it'll
make user upgrades theoretically a
breeze although it's not likely to win
any prizes for the best value or
necessarily even the best feature set
the s10 is great for if you have a
little bit more money for your sub
notebook and you want to look absolutely
fabulous while you're using it the style
and the form is unprecedented for the
Lenovo s10 also if you have any
suggestions for future products or any
topics you want to see covered
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
