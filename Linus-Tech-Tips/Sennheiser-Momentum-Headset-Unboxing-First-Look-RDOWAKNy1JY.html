the Sennheiser momentum series so this
is their response to boutique sort of
stylish but mobile and portable I mean
Sennheiser has been building headphones
for very long time they're very
experienced they build wonderful
sounding headphones but they haven't
really done sort of a competitor to
something like a beats and I don't mean
to say they haven't done a competitor to
a beats in terms of audio quality
because they've definitely done many
competitors two beats in terms of audio
quality but they haven't done something
where it's not designed to sort of sit
in your easy chair and listen to music
and enjoy the experience something
that's meant to be taken with you on the
go so this is the momentum series made
for iPod iPhone and iPad so you can
already see that the way the the
branding is about it there's nothing
about a pair of headphones that makes it
made for an iPod other than the fact
that it has a three-and-a-half
millimeter connector on the end also
there's this so momentum the name itself
means okay it's meant to go with you
sort of on the go
easing control of iPhone with Smart
Remote and inline mic okay so it does
have that going for it but that doesn't
mean that it won't work with other
things a volume up and down play pause
answer and reject a call so it is a
headset as well as headphones skip to
the next previous track and activate
voice control these are a closed circum
aural headphone designed to isolate
ambient noise so noise isolation for me
anyway is a very big deal when I'm out
and about it's nice to be able to sit on
the bus and not have to listen to the
conversation of the people next to me
where they're talking about I don't know
whether Bruce Banner is you know the
actor is buff enough to be a hero or
whether it's okay that he's kind of
Pinner because he's a scientist and
whatever not that you know the tech tips
crew has conversations like this much to
my annoyance when I'm have to sit in the
car with them I'm getting a big grin
from our new camera operator whose
nickname is b-roll just so you guys know
we have a new member of the tech tips
team this was the first announcement of
that on the back close circumaural
design luxurious and tough breathable
leather headband for up from the sweat
and water-resistant soft and supple find
this leather earpads for excellent
wearing comfort metal construction ear
cup slider for maximum durability in
custom fit and the integrated smart
control it does come with a carry
case this is the brown version so
there's a black version coming but we
don't have it yet there's a little like
packaging thing here some Heiser is good
at packaging although I swear the
packaging for the PC 350 was just
designed to prevent product returns not
that I'm saying anyone would want to
return the PC 360 headset it's just that
it was so like brutally impossible to
put back together that you probably
wouldn't be able to take it back
anywhere anyway so none of this really
looks that interesting there's your
warranty information and Quick Start
Guide if you need a Quick Start Guide
for a headset and you probably need help
getting dressed in the morning because
let's face it headsets and headphones
are as much a part of a lot of people's
daily ensemble that they wear as a shirt
so it comes with a little loop here that
huh no no I give this sort of a b- for
how rugged and durable it looks I'm not
sure how long that's going to hold on
for you but it's also not expected to
hold much weight the the zippers
themselves they'll feel much better so
they've got a little bit a little
braided loop sort of rope here nice
solid piece to hold on to while you open
them up they have a good sliding feel to
them so they don't feel cheap like
they're just gonna stop working after a
little while I mean that's that's a huge
thing because not everyone wants to just
wear something like this around their
neck all the time so it's nice to have a
carrying case feels very well built so
the inside is soft not going to scratch
anything and is obviously molded
perfectly for these headphones because
that's not intended to be used with
anything else and I've again good great
packaging so they actually have cable
management and I'm having a little
trouble with this with one hand cable
management built right into the package
here so this is all kind of like aha I
can see I always forget this hook and
loop not Velcro velcro is a trademark
hook and loop style adhesive strips so
this whole inside is like the soft side
and then there's a rough side with the
hooks here so you can actually cover
that up
and it'll be useful any number of times
you can start here when you're not using
it then we've got all the little
adapters and stuff that we need that it
comes with and I'll show you guys what
we got inside so it comes with a
three-and-a-half millimeter to the
larger style headphone jack I can never
remember them
but I'm sure someone will correct me in
the comments and let me know that it's
not what I thought it was which I
couldn't remember there you go so we got
one of those just in case I mean if
you're gonna buy a nice expensive pair
of headphones yeah they're not cheap
guys for those of you who were wondering
if you're gonna buy a nice expensive
pair of headphones you might as well
enjoy them not just on your iPhone it
also has a this okay so check this out
this right here is a locking connector
that goes into the bottom of the
headphones themselves they have SWAT it
has a swappable cable system there you
go so that if you break the cable or
lose the cable or anything bad happens
you're gonna be able to replace it and
check this out you see this little piece
right here that allows you to put it in
and then lock it in so that it's going
to be resistant to being accidentally
pulled out like I'm actually heaving on
this thing because you know it's just a
sample pair of headphones I guess it
doesn't matter if accidentally break it
but I'm not accidentally breaking it
which is great because headphones do get
caught on things and we're just gonna
take a break while that truck finishes
moving so I realized I haven't shown
this to you guys yet but there you go
there's the four pole two three pole
which is just for a regular headphone
operation no built-in volume control and
I had b-roll sort of correct me on
something here I actually didn't even
realize this but there are different
standards for play track skip volume up
and volume down so this control here
does not work on Android so I have my
phone in my pocket it is not working you
can see the mic on the back this is a
metal piece which does give a little bit
more weight to the cord but because the
headphones themselves are quite late
it's not that much of an issue and it
really feels quality when you're
actually using it when you can use it
because you're you're an iOS user so
there you go the headphone length is
optimal for kind of putting in your
pocket running down a little bit and
then kind of putting it up your shirt
cuz a lot of people do that or you can
just let it hang so it is again meant to
be used on the go I haven't shown you
guys this yet this is really cool I
don't think I've ever seen a headphone
jack quite like this it has a little
Torx here so it looks like you can
tighten and loosen it but it's got 90
degrees of play here so that you can
have it come out at an angle or you can
have it come straight out and it kind of
sticks wherever you put it it doesn't
really
move unfortunately it doesn't go all the
way back the other way but it still
gives you I mean you can obviously turn
it around if you want cuz it's just
sitting in a headphone jack now in terms
of audio quality there are no HD 5 5s 5s
which are my most the Sennheiser
headphones I have the most experience
with they've been replaced by the five
five eight in spite of the fact that the
five five aids do cost significantly
less because they're aimed at more of a
different a different style of customer
so someone who wants something that is
fashionable stylish portable comfortable
lightweight may prefer the Momentum's
but if you are sitting at your computer
or in your armchair and you want to sit
and enjoy your music I would recommend
more of an open style headphone like the
five five eight now these are not super
closed I can hear a little bit of what's
going around around me but they are
definitely so it's not quite like it has
active noise-cancelling but they are
pretty close to the point where I was
having a little bit of trouble
communicating with my camera crew when I
was wearing them adjusting the earphones
it's just like this so it's kind of a
rubber piece here that slides within
this metal and you can see there's
enough slack on the cord here that
you're not going to risk accidentally
tugging on it there is some play to the
ear cups themselves so depending on the
shape of your head they can rotate
around this pivot right here the natural
leather really feels a lot better than
the pleather that gets used in most
headphones and you can see there's mesh
here to keep them breathable in spite of
how well you know leather might not seem
like something that would be that would
be breathable and would be comfortable
against your skin but it really is the
top doesn't have much padding but
because they're not heavy this little
bit of padding here actually does feel
like enough and the construction I mean
it shouldn't be it shouldn't be
undersold how cool the construction of
these is so there's more little torque
screws there holding the whole thing
together and I think that pretty much
wraps it up thank you for checking out
