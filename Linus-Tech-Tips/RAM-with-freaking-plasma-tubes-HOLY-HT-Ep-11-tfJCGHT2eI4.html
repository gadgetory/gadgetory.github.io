this green PCBs black chips gold
contacts on the bottom boring today we
have plasma ran yes my friends memory
modules with frickin plasma tubes on the
top in three different colors let's have
a look
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description now there
are actually ways to spend more money on
computer memory that offer meaningful
benefits for example this is ECC
registered memory it has an extra chip
in the middle it does error correction
on-the-fly meaning if like a solar
freakin you know flare or some crap
flips a bit on your RAM you are not
going to compromise your data integrity
at least in theory but come on consumers
don't want that stuff they want flash
not - so that is where the whole idea of
Gus seeing up computer memory to make it
look higher performance came from with
guys like ocz and Corsair being among
the first to take that regular boring
memory I showed you before and put heat
spreaders on it heat spreaders in theory
are great idea they spread the heat so
they take the heat from the chips they
help dissipate it and in the early days
you could actually get more overclocking
Headroom out of better cooled memory
with BH 5s or whatever but it's less of
an issue today from there they went well
let's get more creative about the heat
spreaders that's where we got like
stylized heat spreaders and these ones
from g.skill look pretty darn good I
mean taking it to the next level with
Corsair with LED lighting on there heat
spreaders and then well little windows
so you could see the LED lighting even
better but today's video is not about
any of those things today's video is
about the culmination
a flashing memory that does not perform
any better than any other Ram that is to
say unless the other Ram is rated at a
slower speed because that is how you
determine how fast memory is button
scooted is rated at not by how sexy it
looks the Raiden series from of X here
which we have here in three different
flavors each of which is a different
color let's check them out alright so
for my first trick I will be installing
the Raven series 26 66 megahertz of red
Tesla ROG certified memory modules here
what makes them ROG certified I'm not
quite sure and I will never know because
I'm actually installing them in a non
ROG motherboard because I am a rebel
rebel right here they're actually
surprisingly light I have kind of
expected them to be a heavier maybe I
just don't have a lot of context for how
much a plasma wave I think the tube is
mostly empty and now you can see what
they look like ooh that's cool oh there
goes another one
will the last one light up
um wait for it yeah there it is that
looks fantastic let's get these lights
off
that is gorgeous this is great news
because there's a train going by while
we're filming no but seriously this is
great news because my intended use for
these memory modules is actually for a
father-daughter build and I asked of X
here hey what color are they are they
really red or are they kind of pinky and
they're like oh yeah they're red but
they're definitely kind of pinky which
is exactly what I wanted I'm doing like
a white and pink themed build it's gonna
look freaking awesome so this is like
the best news I've had all day let's
check out the other colors taking a
gamble in life which one is green and
which one is blue there's only one way
to find out actually there are two ways
to find it well okay I did not realize
that they were clearly color-coded on
the dims so there are three ways to find
out by looking at the box by plugging
them in and looking at what color the
plasma tubes are or by just not plugging
them in but looking at them at all three
ways let's get these in there this I'm
expecting to be different and it is
first this one lit up then this one Bend
this one totally different
I think it has to do with different
warm-up times for the plasma tubes those
look so freakin cool
what I want to know though is if they're
like the ones at science world where
they're actually attracted to your touch
and they kind of all they are no way oh
you're getting a close-up of that right
the whole thing get brighter get in
there
why's that
we're not fun experiencing a whole new
color of plasma tubes like that I sure
think so and that brings us finally to
the last color and perhaps the true
purpose of this video because I'm sure
some of you at home are sitting there
going - this isn't even new these things
have existed for literally years going
back to ddr3 at the very least and the
purpose of this video is that a vex ear
reached out and they were like hey yo do
you want to review our RAM I said hey no
not really because we don't review RAM
because we think it's kind of pointless
it doesn't affect system performance
much and as far as I'm concerned looks
are as much of a purchasing factor for
me as the speed on the side of the
modules but what I did say was but we do
a lot of cool builds and we would love
to have some of that sexy looking plasma
RAM that we can color match to whatever
builds we're doing and they said okay
but are you gonna make a video about our
RAM modules I said sure we'll make a
video where we install them in a
motherboard and we show all the
different colors and then that way we
will have those sticks for the future
when we want to do cool color matched
builds with sick dope looking plasma ram
things in them and that my friends is
the purpose of today's episode of holy
plasma memory oh I think the blue color
is the best actually that is a that is a
fairly deep sexy looking electric blue I
am liking it now I was trying to come up
with some way to kind of tie ting into
the plasma ran like when you touch the
plasma tube it's attracted to you with
good energy and positive energy and
calling ting and talking to a customer
service agent instead of going through
like an automated phone directory but it
didn't work so we're just going to stick
to the script
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction first you pay only for what
you use with the average ting bill
coming in at only $23 a month per device
and if you're stuck in a contract and
you go over to ting comm I believe it's
Linus ENCOM and you
try out their savings calculator it will
tell you you just put in your last few
bills and it's like this is how much you
would be paying on tank it'll tell you
if you'd save money and if you would and
you want to switch over to ting they'll
cover 25% of your cancellation fee for
your current contract up to $75 and they
are now lowering mobile data rates
across the board data is now just $10
per gig beyond the first gigabyte whoo
every single tank customer will be able
to reap the benefits of this change so
head over to line of starting comm and
try out their savings calculator with
their new lower data rates and when you
sign up at our link you'll get 25 bucks
in service credit or towards a new
device so thanks for watching guys if
you dislike this video hit that dislike
button I'm sorry that you hate fun but
if you like this video hit that like
button get subscribe maybe even consider
checking out where to buy these cool
memory modules or any of the other stuff
on my test bench here at the link in the
video description or you can also check
out where my cool merch like this
t-shirt that I'm wearing at our merch
store over on teespring as well as a
link to our community forum where you
can go and talk tech including like why
is Linus acting like plasma memory is
new I'm not acting like it's new I'm
acting like it's exciting which it is
but you can discuss that with other
people you know you can all be in
agreement that I am stupid and you know
wrong or whatever else
I think there are other colors that I do
subscribe and right don't forget to
check out our other videos over on
channel super fun right about over there
yes oh that's plastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
