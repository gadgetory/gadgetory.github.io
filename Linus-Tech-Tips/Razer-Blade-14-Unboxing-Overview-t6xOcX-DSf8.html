for more details welcome to my unboxing
an overview of the Razer Blade 14 from
well Razer so first of all it comes
packed in soft foam so it's already my
favorite notebook kept not just kidding
ok it does compact and soft foam but it
doesn't get too many points for that
because it's an extremely expensive
notebook for our 256 gig configuration
you're looking at about 2 G's putting it
right up there in the Apple s Alon in
terms of pricing but the real question
is does it deserve to be there in terms
of the unboxing experience we're going
to do a very very short version of it
this is what the box looks like foam
typical green beautiful Razer packaging
as we've come to expect from them and
other than that there's not a whole lot
in here so there's a little bundle of
what you typically come to expect so you
get a couple of Razer stickers as well
as a microfiber cloth honestly it's not
going to do you a whole lot of good the
black finish is absolutely beautiful but
you can never get it quite perfect as
far as I can tell I even tried using
some alcohol in order to get it off but
honestly it really isn't that bad
either at least it's black unlike these
silver finishes that the fingerprints
really do show up on you also get a
letter from the CEO and chief gamer of
Razer as well as a QuickStart guide not
going to worry too much about any of
that other than that all you'll find in
the box is they're very sleek very sexy
power brick this is 150 watt power brick
but as you can see from my traditional
phone size comparison here's an HTC one
is it extremely small for 150 watt brick
razor claims they spent several times as
much as most manufacturers will on a
power brick in order to have it fit in
this form factor this was extremely
important to them because they were
going for portability as well as gaming
performance with this particular machine
so speaking of portability it is only
0.6 6 inches thick so we're going to go
ahead and give you a look at it
physically here's that phone comparison
for you again it weighs only 4.1 pounds
it is 14 inch and it is not
and Ultrabook because it has well not
because but it has much more performance
than an ultrabook in spite of the fact
that the form factor looks an awful lot
like an ultrabook this has a
full-fledged GTX 765 M razor has done
nothing in terms of down clocking that
graphics card it also has a core i7
quad-core processor so that my friends
is what makes this not an ultrabook it
is a 4702 HQ which means it runs at 2.2
gigahertz base 3.2 gigahertz boost so
you can see we're running Crysis 1 right
now so the answer is can it run Crysis
yes I'm running it very high 1600 by 900
at the native resolution the keyboard is
quite well spaced out considering that
this is a 14 inch notebook the speakers
are quite loud although as with most
notebooks sound it's not the most you
know rich gorgeous sound you've ever
heard but it is certainly functional for
gaming even in an environment where
there's a fair amount of ambient noise
such as at a LAN party so back to the
keyboard here there are 20 different
incremental steps for the keyboard
backlight all the way from completely
off to an extremely vibrant green that
reminds me of the Black Widow ultimate
2013 the keyboard is also fully
compatible it synapse 2.0 meaning you
can remap every key to whatever you want
and program advanced macros I wish there
was a number pad but given that they
would have had to sacrifice the spacing
of it and it is actually quite a
satisfying tactile keyboard you can hear
there's a bit of a click the one key
that I would for the two keys I would
really complain about are the spacebar
has a bit of a tinny sort of plasticky
feel to it and then I don't really like
Aero pad configurations like this but I
don't really find myself using the arrow
keys much these days the touchpad I've
seen other people complain about but I
personally didn't find it that obnoxious
people were saying they prefer a clicky
touchpad I don't
I prefer dedicated buttons at the bottom
and that is exactly what you find with
the Razer Blade 14 however there was a
little bit of glitchyness in fine
movements sometimes when selecting icons
and then clicking by touching the
touchpad it's shown up a couple times
for me but not a ton hopefully this is
something that they can fix in sort of a
silent revision after the review units
go out this
is a review unit not a finished one for
physicality it's very bare-bones so
along the right hand side of the
notebook we find USB 3 HDMI and a
security lock on the back of the
notebook whoa there's nothing where are
all the air vents I'll show you that
later don't worry guys on the left side
of the notebook we find power in it fits
very snugly this is a huge oversight on
one of my notebooks an MSI gaming
notebook I got a few years back I think
they've addressed it now but the power
plug just slips out a lot of the time so
I do like to see a snug power plug would
prefer magnetic two USB 3.0 ports on
this side as well as a headphone
microphone combo jack then on the front
we find a whole lot more of nothing the
hinge is very easy to open so I mean I
guess this is kind of unfair to it but
even holding it up in the air I can get
that separated you don't have to wedge
two fingers in there in order to get it
open and how does the ventilation work
how the devil did they fit a gtx 765 m
and hold o i'm just going to turn the
sound off a gtx 765 m in a quad core
into this form factor 2 ventilation fans
down here so we're running crisis right
now actually I'm going to unpause the
game so you guys can get some idea of
how loud these fans are they are louder
than a silent notebook but here check
this out so I'm putting this right next
to my boom mic so you guys can see what
I'm doing here they are quieter than my
aspire s7 which is more of an ultrabook
but it doesn't have a GPU and doesn't
have actually I don't even think it has
about a six-hour battery life so battery
wise you can get anywhere from around 5
to 6 hours out of it in a light to
medium usage case scenario however when
you're gaming obviously that's going to
be significantly reduced so these two
fans on the bottom here vent air aha
up here so it's actually completely
stealth up at the top of the keyboard
there are two major exhaust ports here
and here now the advantage of this
design is that you don't have to look at
any exhaust vents the disadvantage is it
means the top of the notebook does get
very toasty in a gaming scenario and
because it's using an aluminum unibody
chassis that heat does tend to spread
out a fair bit so what we're going to be
doing at near the end of the
video is I'm going to take my
temperature probe right here and I'm
going to be running this game and I'm
going to stick the probe to various
parts of the notebook to give you guys
an idea of how exactly it runs even if
it means the heat gets spread out that's
a good thing for one reason because it's
part of what allows that massive power
inside this notebook to be possible in
this form factor and aluminium compared
to plastic there's just no comparison
there's no flex to it it feels good it
reminds me a lot of something like the
black MacBook Pro back in the day before
Apple kibosh that which I think was one
of the most beautiful notebooks ever
it's stylish and elegant so on the top
you've just got a couple of subtle
accents as well as an illuminated Razer
logo I'm going to go ahead and turn it
back on so you can see the illumination
there on the side the only thing that
reveals that this is a gaming notebook
is the tiny green accents and things
like the USB ports and then the green
backlit keyboard other than that it's
something that you could easily sit in a
boardroom meeting with and you wouldn't
have to feel like a total weirdo part of
the way that it achieves that long
battery life making it suitable for
business use is the fact that it employs
Nvidia Optimus technology so that means
that the dedicated graphics card pretty
much turns off when you're not using it
and Intel's new has well fourth
generation Core processors are so
efficient when they're only being used a
little bit that well all of a sudden
this is possible I remember saying when
the original blade launched this is
interesting but what I'm really excited
for is next gen next gen is finally here
now with that said this notebook is not
perfect it lacks an SD card reader
it lacks a dedicated hard wired Ethernet
port however the wireless end solution
does use bigfoot killer optimizations in
order to prioritize your gaming traffic
so that's at least better than nothing
but the one that really bothers me is
the screen so I'm going to get you guys
to come in and have a look at the screen
so check this out so that's your
straight on viewing angle if you guys
have been watching my channel for any
amount of time you'll know that I am a
huge advocate for non TN panels and this
panel is about as TN as it gets the
colors are not as vibrant or deep as
you'll get with an IPS pls or even a VA
panel of some sort
the viewing angles are quite well
they're some of the worst I've seen on a
notebook that costs more than you know
between 500 and $1,000 in a very long
time and I found that very disappointing
I for one I'm not disappointed about the
resolution 1600 by 900 is very
acceptable considering that a 765 M is
not you know a desktop GTX 780 so you're
better off to have slightly lower
resolution natively and be able to run
at native res rather than running at a
non-native res in your games and the
pixel density at 14 inches for a 1600 by
900 screen is actually not that bad like
I don't I don't mind that at all
although I've seen complaints about that
from other reviewers this particular
configuration has 8 gigs of ram a 256
gig SSD a 70 watt hour battery Bluetooth
4.0 Windows 8 as well as a built-in HD
webcam and some of the things about this
notebook that I also find exceptional
are check this out
partly due to the fact that it's an SSD
partly due to the fact that it's
extremely fast and partly due to the
fact that it has no bloatware here's our
wake from sleep time also at boots from
cold in about 12 seconds so this is I'm
a Windows 8 it's one of the few things
that really truly is great about it
speakers are I think I already covered
that loud enough for gaming but you know
nothing really super special and I think
that pretty much covers it so let's go
ahead and show you guys some Crysis
gameplay as well as give you some
temperature readings from various points
on the notebook to start our thermal
tests we went with what we found was the
hottest spot where air was being
exhausted from the blade 14 so that was
right at this point right here and it's
about 50 degrees when we measure the
temperature of the notebook in that
particular spot now with that said you
don't touch it here although it does
feel very warm to the touch but well
look at that mean touching it reduce the
temperature that's awesome but we are
going to take some temperatures at other
places where it might be more important
next we taped our thermal probe to the Q
key which is right next to the W key so
that's typically where your gamer is
going to want to rest their thing
and we found that to be around 29 to 30
degrees in a gaming load the other place
where a gamer is typically going to rest
on the notebook as the palm rest so
we've taken another dab of thermal goop
and taped down our sensor here where
we're getting anywhere from around
thirty to thirty two and a half degrees
it does tend to fluctuate a little bit
so the temperature at least is quite
consistent from the WASD all the way to
the palm rest however that is quite warm
and it will cause some sweaty hand
syndrome now years ago the system
manufacturers wanted to move away from
calling these things laptops and switch
to calling them notebooks because they
didn't intend for you to actually
operate them in your lap because that
interfered with cooling so when we are
taking a temperature from the middle of
the bottom of the notebook you can see
that gets quite toasty guys this is a
notebook not a laptop at 45 degrees 46
degrees now the heat being transferred
into your lap is quite toasty so while
you're going to get some sweaty hand
syndrome going on up at the top left
here on the keyboard Razer has
effectively kept the heat mostly away
from the top of the notebook however on
the bottom it gets quite warm so I'm
going to show you once again where that
thermal probe was affixed the closer we
get to this edge where the heat is
actually being exhausted the well the
more dramatic the temperature increase
is so right near your knees is where it
would run the hottest with all of that
said the edge 14 is an absolute marvel
of engineering and it is a miracle that
a company that's known best for gaming
mice and gaming keyboards in only a
couple of product iterations managed to
come out with this with that said it's a
couple grand personally I'll be waiting
for the next gen when it's this maybe
runs a little bit cooler or maybe
doesn't maybe has a little bit more
performance comes with an IPS screen and
then we're really talking about taking
some of my money because that's probably
going to happen I understand why they
used a TN panel they do tend to have
faster response times which for some
gamers is more important but I
personally find the richer colours
more engaging experience versus the
faster response times of a TN and with
that said IPS panels also do cost more
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips guys leave a comment under the
video tell me what you think of the
razor blade 14 and as always wait don't
forget to subscribe yeah I like the
video to do all of those things because
it actually is very helpful so this is
kind of a spontaneous teardown of the
blade 14 b-roll made a comment that we
were just talking about the cost of this
notebook versus other options available
on the market and I said well you know
isn't is a MacBook a completely stupid
thing to buy and kind of went yes and I
said well ok but it doesn't have nearly
the same kind of horsepower as something
like this and he said well yeah but it's
also better built and I kind of went
well no I don't really think so because
the level of integration that's going on
here is outstanding plus there are some
things that you can do here that you
can't necessarily do with with every
MacBook so for example there's an M SATA
SSD so the SSD is actually upgraded now
or upgradable now while you can't
necessarily upgrade everything you can
see all the ddr3 memory is soldered
right to the mainboard you can change
you know your wireless chipset it looks
like the battery should be possibly
removable here we can also see just how
flat everything is packed within the
inside of this notebook so there's our
two cooling fans right here and here
each of them gets two heat pipes and a
very small aluminum thinner a so this
right here looks like it must be the GPU
because I can see the dedicated memory
around the outside of it and then this
one right here is the CPU so I think
that's pretty much all I wanted to show
you guys inside the notebook and I guess
this is the old Seinfeld double goodbye
but farewell again my friends that goes
nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
