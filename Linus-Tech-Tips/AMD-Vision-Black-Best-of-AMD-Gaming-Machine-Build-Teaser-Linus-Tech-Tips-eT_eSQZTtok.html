arrived I've got an extreme AMD build
that I'm going to be working on for an
upcoming launch that I can't really talk
about yet but I'm going to go over all
the parts that are going to be in this
particular sort of best of AMD system so
first of all we're going to be housing
everything in the Corsair graphite
series 600t case extreme airflow all of
the amenities for all the hardware we're
going to be using very very very nice
looking case great cable management
actually did an unboxing a while back so
you can check that out if you don't
already know everything there is to know
about the 600t in terms of the
motherboard we've got pretty much the
best of the best for AMD motherboards
the crosshair for formula there is a
crosshair for extreme but it's debatable
whether there is much benefit to the
extreme over the formula because the
hydrologic chip does not contribute a
whole lot in my opinion okay next we
have you radeon 6870 and hopefully
shortly i will have a second 6870 to add
in crossfire so that we are truly
getting the best of AMD in this
configuration now remember even though
the 6870 is a little bit slower than the
5870 in some older titles as games start
to make more use of tessellation which
is a very advanced to directx 11 feature
this one is going to really pull away
from the 5870 and we're already seeing
that all right in terms of power supply
we have the ax 850 which I did do an
unboxing of a while back as well for
that matter in unboxing the 6870 as well
so this is a single rail high-end 80
plus gold power supply it has a modular
interface which means you only attach or
detach whichever cables you require
efficiency is a huge story for this guy
though at 115 volt AC I mean you're
looking at basically above eighty eight
percent efficiency no matter what you
throw at it so very very very impressive
next of all we have let's see what do we
have got lots of cool stuff for this
build I'm very excited oh yeah we've got
two sandforce corsair force series SSDs
and we're going to run these in raid 0
for maximum performance so that means
we're going to have an 80 gig boot drive
because remember when you run in raid 0
you get double the capacity double the
performance but also double the chance
of data failure so make sure even if you
are running SSDs which are very reliable
that you are doing backups I've done an
unboxing I'll be four series SSDs as
well if you can find on my blog we have
a Dominator airflow fan which I believe
I've also demonstrated in the past which
will be using on our dominator GT memory
modules now these are look awesome and
they're going to go really well with the
Republic of gamers theme of the build as
well as the red and black color scheme
that we have going on the graphics cards
it's going to look really really sharp
so we've got some dominator GT s here
with the red tops and the red stickers
on the side these are running at
eighteen sixty six megahertz c9 so that
should be some pretty good memory
performance although yeah I don't think
that's some
I forget where I was going with that
okay we have the course our age 70 to
handle the cooling we actually showcase
the age 70 and one of the NCIX pc build
we did very recently it is a very high
performance very impressive little
cooler and I shouldn't say little
because the radiator on this thing is
like thick thick and then you got two
fins and you run them in push-pull you
get great performance out of it so we're
going to show you all of this when we've
got the build completed and last but not
least I have the CPU which we're not
going to talk about so there it is that
is our best of AMD build that we're
going to be doing over the next little
bit and also as part of this teaser I'm
telling you guys what I will be doing
with this hardware is a build guide I've
had yes endless requests for a pc build
guide so just in time for the holiday
season this year I will be doing a fall
how to build a pc guide around this best
of AMD system that is based on AMD
vision black so we're using all AMD
vision black components don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and also
don't forget to chime engine dense eix
pc a few times here don't forget to
check out NCIX pc on facebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
