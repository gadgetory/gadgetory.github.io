to your system is expensive so it
shouldn't come then as a surprise that
there is no shortage of software
solutions out there that promise to
enhance your gaming experience without
an investment in more hardware and there
have been a lot of flavors of software
secret sauce over the years from
nonsense like basic programs that just
closed the stuff you have open in the
background to more credible solutions
like driver updates new AP is like
DirectX 12 and Vulcan and now Windows 10
game mode but is this a truly tasty
addition to your gaming smorgasbord
or is it 2017 s version of blast
proccesing let's find out
G skillz km 780 our RGB mechanical
keyboard features a brushed aluminum top
plate on-the-fly macro recording and
different Cherry MX switch
configurations learn more at the link
below
so the second major update to Windows 10
called the creators update has a
plethora of new enhancements but we're
going to be laser focused on game mode a
feature that Microsoft bills as
providing a better and more consistent
gaming experience on Windows 10 by
dedicating more system resources to your
game sounds interesting but how does it
work well using game mode is simple it
can be enabled with one click from the
Settings app then when you load your
game you open the windows game bar by
pressing the Windows key and G and
ensure it's enabled for that specific
game by clicking the little gear icon
neat but can something this easy really
make your gaming experience better and
more consistent
well since Microsoft seems to be making
2 separate claims here we decided to
test each one of them individually by
looking at average frame rates to
determine if the experience was better
overall as well as 99.9 percent minimum
FPS to judge the consistency of the
experience for our game suite we went
with Deus Ex mankind divided ashes of
the benchmark and Gears of War 4 we were
particularly interested in the latter as
it's a universal Windows platform game
and we wanted to see if it's supposedly
tighter integration with Microsoft
technology might make it behave a little
differently for our testbed Z we
actually used three different hardware
configurations which you can see on the
screen right now the goal here was to
represent modern high-end mid-range and
budget oriented gaming setups so let's
dive into the results and look first
then at how game mode affected
average frame rates hmm not very much
the difference between game mode and non
game mode benchmarks was only a frame or
two per second across the board and
sometimes not even that much with the
exception of gears for on our high-end
system though I can't imagine why the
vast majority of you would notice or
care about the difference between 145
and 154 fps but as the college-educated
among you well know dips in performance
can actually be more impactful than
average frame rates so did game-mode
prevent or lessen slowdowns well we
actually did see a difference in our
minimum frame rates here but
unfortunately it wasn't in the direction
that you yes--you microsoft PR rep may
have been hoping for both Deus Ex and
ashes performed noticeably worse in
DirectX 11 mode and the minimums on
gears for absolutely tanked on our
high-end set up switching ap is to
DirectX 12 didn't do us many favors
except in Gears which did at least
improve by five and a half frames on our
core i5 GTX 1060 system but still that
precipitous drop on higher-end Hardware
left us scratching our heads a little
bit so what exactly is going on here
did Microsoft management decide that the
release of Windows Vista was far too
long ago and they were overdue to give
us another astonishingly poorly
implemented piece of software well it's
hard to say for certain but our
hypothesis is that the problem actually
isn't at least entirely the poor
execution but rather that the overall
concept as a whole is just kind of at
its very cool
or game-mode is purportedly trying to
divert more of your system resources to
your games without answering the
all-important questions of one what
resources are we talking about exactly
and to our games really starved for them
so the largest single defining factor in
how modern games will perform is how
powerful your graphics card is and I
think it's pretty safe to say that no
self-respecting gamer is putting a
secondary load like Bitcoin mining or
neural network simulation on their GPU
in the background while they're playing
Metro last light and then even for games
that are considered more CPU bound they
still usually don't use up so much CPU
time that they're going to be seriously
affected by other programs running in
the background partially because
reasonably modern versions of Windows
going back to 7 already do a pretty darn
good job of deciding on the most
sensible way to divvy up CPU time
between all of your different tasks so
why even bother releasing it then we've
got a couple of ideas first up it could
be that game mode was developed for
users that have so many junk where
applications or even outright malware
like viruses running in the background
that system resources are constantly
tied up but we would suggest that in
that case you probably have bigger
problems than a few FPS in League of
Legends and number two maybe they were
going after lower end or older hardware
but then even our budget set up that
included a dual-core CPU and a graphics
card that doesn't even need an extra
power connector didn't benefit from game
mode to be fair to Microsoft our testing
wasn't comprehensive so with them
literally mill
of combinations of hardware games and
game engines out there it's possible
that there are folks out there having
better luck with game mode than we did
and we'd love to hear from you guys in
the comments below but for our part
especially in light of microsoft's
recent push to force Windows 10 users
onto newer hardware platforms game-mode
really feels like a solution seeking a
problem for the moment Skillshare in a
nutshell it's an online learning
