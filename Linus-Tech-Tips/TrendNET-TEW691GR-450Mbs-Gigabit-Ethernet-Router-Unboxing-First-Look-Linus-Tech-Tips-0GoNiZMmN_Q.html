that it is the first of its kind it's a
wireless n 450 megabit per second router
so what that means is that it is twice
as fast as the other no no it's not
twice as fast as anything it's fifty
percent faster than the other high speed
wireless end devices and it is three
times faster than the basic wireless end
devices which are rated at 150 megabit
per second so let's see what trend that
has to say for themselves on the box
first of all this is a green net product
which means that it employs some smart
power saving techniques in order to
reduce power consumption so things like
powering off the ports that aren't being
used on the switch for example it has i
popping 450 megabit per second wireless
speed and coverage Gigabit Ethernet
ports for high-performance wired
connections you can stream videos
download files talk online and play
games all at the same time and connect
computers with one touch Wi-Fi Protected
setup so like a one touch setup thing
now what also makes this unique is that
at the time of release there was
absolutely nothing on the market in
terms of 450 megabit per second clients
that's have been been remedied now by
trendnet themselves they have their 450
megabit per second wireless and gaming
adapter these days so that helps a lot
and then yeah like you can see you can
see when they design the box related
products a bunch of 300 megabits per
second stuff so um yeah I mean I guess
there's going to be notebooks with
built-in 450 megabit per second but
there was nothing in terms of something
you could buy from trendnet that would
work with it so I I thought that was
pretty amusing when this first came out
because it was a little while ago
actually so here they're talking about
the features security ah package
contents which we'll see in a moment I
will see what they have to say about
features in security first so high speed
advanced wpa2 wireless security so
that's under Wireless and then there's
security access restriction with
internet access controller and smooth
out so you can read it better there we
go advanced firewall protection with
network address translation and stateful
packet inspection ease of use which
also good on a phone off wireless switch
that's handy that's actually that's
actually really handy there are times
when you do want to turn off your
wireless or at least I've wanted to do
it a couple times and I it's not always
convenient to you know go log into the
web based admin all right here's all the
standards at support so as mentioned
before these are gigabit ethernet ports
to go along with the 450 megabit per
second wireless so with this device you
can pretty much build the fast as
possible home network without getting
into some pretty high-end networking
gear let's move along here let you guys
you can pause this obviously if you want
to read and I'm not going to say too
much unless there's something that
really stands out to me as needing to be
sad and I don't really see anything like
that so this will work with your old G
and B compatible wireless devices just
so that you're aware backwards
compatible just like any wireless end
device the key difference is the speed
so let's see what we find inside first
we have a user's guide on disk then we
have a user sky oh no this is a quick
installation guide okay so we've got
about three pages of English before you
start installing and configuring alright
so configuring Oh Noah kisses ya know
like like 34 pages so they show you the
very very basics which is configuring
your wireless and then setting up
security on it very important stuff and
then obviously you can use the user
guide if you want to get a little bit
deeper into things so here we have one
ethernet cable so that will at least get
you connected from your wireless router
to your internet modem and then if you
want to wire up any computers you're
going to have to use additional cables
and then we have a power adapter so this
power adapter is rated for 12 volts 1
amp so pretty much your run-of-the-mill
power adapter and let's have a look at
the router itself trend that's really
improved so much on their on their old
like blue shelled wireless products
these are the slick black
casings really just well they look a lot
they look a lot more professional a lot
more sharp so here we go here's our
three antennas it does have a three
antenna design so let's have a look at
the physical aspects of this router so
remember this is the te w 691 g r and
you can see right here on the front
we've got all of the indicator LEDs that
we could pretty much need there's our
security one there's wireless LAN
there's another one I'm not sure what
that one's for it's not labeled only one
way to find out later we have lan 1234
labeled as well as our when port so
that's another land port but really that
one goes into your router more than
anything else and then we have a power
light so that means you can Network up
to four computers and one router for
your internet connection as well as any
number of I mean I think it's up to
something like 200 plus wireless clients
although there's no way you'd want to
run that many off so realistically you
know you can run anywhere from 10 to 20
computers off this if you're running
most of them wireless which is kind of
neat here we have some ventilation holes
on the side here we have some
ventilation holes on the other side
there's the WPS I'm going to put my hand
here so that it'll actually focus
there's the WPS one touch wireless set
up and then let's have a close look at
the back so my hand here so we'll focus
there is our power in there's the reset
switch there's our power switch there's
that neat wireless LAN on/off switch
there is our land port and there are the
four land ports that I had mentioned
before so I am going to do some
performance testing with this guy and
I'm going to be using the there te w 687
450 megabit per second client in order
to find out just how fast we can make
this go just what kind of range it has
