for the night how as you cool as you'll
see in a minute it's actually dark
outside now we've got lots more pyramids
set up in the store I think I already
showed the cables but we've gone okay
monitor while I show don't worry I'm
gonna show some progress at some point
though we have TVs now so the TV wall is
set up and we have also made some major
changes to the heatsink island sinks in
one place now we've got some cases in
here now as well notebooks are now set
up on the island in the middle of the
store so we've got lots of different
brands and notebooks including a soos
we've got the g73 which is gonna be on
for 99999 that's the wrong one this is
the g73 for 99999 for the first eight
lucky customers check out the regular
price on this one yeah that's right 9
9999 okay we've also got msi FX 600
we've got some other what happened okay
peez I already killed the gaming land
over there so why don't we Oh
here we've got an identity system set up
if the monitors were on you'd be able to
tell but it's an identity system so
that's running a 5870 inside there so
let's head back over where we have some
more some more system setup we've seen
that already cameraman wasn't with me
for the previous walk around so I ya
know we've seen that okay so we have all
of our powered by a/c systems all set up
now and let's move around over here to
the other side of the store I don't
think I've actually show
since we set up all the motherboards on
the top shelf so one thing that we
didn't actually get done quite on time
if you come over closer again you can
see that those display cabinets are
actually empty because we're waiting on
a top piece of glass for them so the
motherboards were going to be inside the
display cases so you can see this one
has a top piece right here I can put my
hand right through so that wouldn't be
very good for theft prevention very bad
so all the motherboards are up top and
so they're just with the video cards
that keeps everything kind of on display
but out of out of reach somewhat you
know what let's have a look outside
let's head outside and I'll show you it
is now dark so my first video was posted
when it was light and morning and now it
is dark and not morning anymore it's
actually a boat Wow what's at what time
is it this is this is specific times a
hold on one - so it's 138 right now and
we've already got a lot so I showed the
front of the store in the daytime so
let's just step back a little bit
further so we don't catch any people who
don't want to be all over YouTube in our
video here so you can see we've already
got people camping out in the middle of
the night to check out some of the
pretty good deals we're all pretty good
