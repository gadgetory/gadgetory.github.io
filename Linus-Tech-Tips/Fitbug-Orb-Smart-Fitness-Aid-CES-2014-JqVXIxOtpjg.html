brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital this is the fit bug
orbit is a tiny little fitness aid that
intends to remove a lot of the excuses
that come along with most of them it's
pretty much the simplest possible thing
that still enables useful functionality
so it has a 3d accelerometer it has low
power bluetooth and it uses a coin
battery to last for several months at a
time so you don't have to put it on your
nightstand at night to charge it the
idea is you should always be able to be
wearing it in some form or another it
has a watch strap which I could
obviously demoed right here it also has
a belt clip which I can demo for you
guys right here go ahead and throw that
on there and finally it has an underwear
clip that is magnetic that I would be
happy to demo for you guys no I'm just
kidding i'm not going to demo that part
but it hasn't underwear clip this is
great for women who don't necessarily
have a belt or they want to wear watch
you can strap it to your underpants or
your bra or something like that so you
can always have it on you it's an
evolution from their last generation fit
bug air which had a display so how is
something without a display an evolution
from something that had one well because
it has bluetooth now we have an appt yes
friends it has an app it also has an
online component now the app has all the
basic functionality so it'll give you
your total steps aerobic steps it even
helps you track things like sleep so it
can tell you yo dog you're sleep
deprived because you went to bed like in
the middle of the night and then you
woke up like four times and you were
tossing and turning it can tell you all
kinds of great stuff like that and aside
from the app they are now launching a
new little program of customized while
programs so these are I believe they
were 12 wheat programs and whether you
want to burn off that baby fat or you
want to you know stretch out or get in
shape for skiing they give you little
webinars as well as personalized goals
some nutrition tips and such like that
and the idea is to have it instead of
just being you know well hey we're fit
bug so we're credible so you should
probably listen to us
is that they're going to have well
renowned trainers or celebrities backing
them and endorsing them to show you that
it's not just them making things up so
to speak it's the ok so the kicker guys
is that it's only 50 bucks so when you
compare that to something like actually
the next door neighbors here that have a
much more advanced sort of fitness e
type device but is of course much more
expensive and not necessarily easier to
make yourself use all the time actually
makes it look kind of appealing thank
you for checking out our coverage of the
fit bug orb don't miss any of our CES
2014 coverage guys remember we are
powered here at the show by NCIX your
source for great technology selection
and service as well as Corsair and
western digital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
