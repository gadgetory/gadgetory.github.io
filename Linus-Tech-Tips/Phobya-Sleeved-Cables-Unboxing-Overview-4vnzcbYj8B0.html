for more details so this unboxing should
be pretty straightforward right here
we've got ourselves some phobia cable
adapters and whatnots and what I'm
actually going to do is I'm just going
to show you what they look like in the
packaging because it's really not that
interesting or exceptional and then what
I'll be doing after that is i will be
showing you what they all look like
outside so i have some special sort of
situations going on here where i needed
some cables that were a little bit sort
of custom-made and i needed them for
very specific purposes here like I've
got eight SSDs they're in very very
close quarters here so I needed some
cables that would work a little bit
better than the ones that come with the
power supply which typically look a
little something like this and are
designed for longer runs in between
individual drives where I don't have a
lot of extra space back here for random
cables so I've got those then I've also
got some 3-pin splitters and extenders
that I'm going to be using to plug fans
and LED strips into mighty balancer here
so let's get those packages open to move
be back in a moment so rather than
emphasize the unboxing portion of this I
just want to show you guys pretty much
what the finished product looks like so
these are the SATA ones and overall they
look pretty good I'd say there's a
little bit of inconsistency in terms of
hopefully this is even going to be able
to focus but in terms of where the see
where the sleeving actually goes up to
in relation to the wire and one of them
actually came without the heat shrink
shrunk so those are still move around
able so that was sort of interesting
well let me just look at that I have my
manual focus on so that might be part of
the issue here right now there we go now
you guys can see what I'm talking about
however the cables are extremely supple
and easy to to bend so this will be a
bit of a look at the horrible horrible
cable management here on the back of my
my personal rig not a whole lot I can do
about it at this point without remaking
a whole bunch of custom cables which I'm
not going to do
but I've got the quad seita ones here so
plugged from a drive to drive to drive
to drive and then out to a molex
connector so that's how I'm able to
power all those drives there without
well without running a whole bunch of
separate SATA cable so there you go
custom cable oh yeah I should probably
show the word one of those one of those
fans splitters go we'll be back in a
moment oh yes here's one of those in
action so there it is it's just 23 pins
up to a single 3 pin which is going into
the T balancer so thanks for checking
out this unboxing and first look and as
