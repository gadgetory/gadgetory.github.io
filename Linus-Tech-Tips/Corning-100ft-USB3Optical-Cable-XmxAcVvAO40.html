cable in the entire history of limas
tech tips we're talking over 2,500
videos here I have only made a dedicated
video about a cable nine times so when I
say this is the coolest cable that I've
ever seen
I hope that makes you want to stick
around and learn more about it Corsair
Gaming RGB keyboards feature precision
cherry on X RGB key switches for sixteen
point eight million color perky
backlighting for virtually unlimited
customization click now to learn more so
the first time I was introduced to
Corning's USB 3.0 optical cables note
that the Box does not say USB 3.0 they
can't call it USB 3.0 since there's no
actual standard for a fiber optic USB 3
cable very clever Corning anyway the
first time I saw them was at CES this
year and for some reason I was the only
one freaking out about it maybe it's
because they're ludicrously expensive I
paid $300 for this one so I could do
this video because I don't know anyone
at Corning but in spite of that I just
can't help but geeked out about them
building this thing without repeaters
and without signal boosters this cable
can carry a signal 10 times the
recommended length for USB 3.0 and
thanks to their clear curve VSD an
optical fiber it does so while being
slimmer and much more durable than a
standard copper cable in fact it's so
durable that at that booth I was talking
about they basically had a try to break
the cable challenge where you could put
there's zero Bend radius to the test so
let's show it off then shall we see this
computer right here got a monitor
running keyboard mouse here's a USB
drive that I can plug into this USB 3
hub next to it and transfer some data
off of it hold on now just wait a second
where is the actual computer at well
let's go find it shall we so following
this optical cable we actually discover
that the computer is a full hundred feet
or three
metres away in the back alley behind the
house now I decided to cheap out and I
went for a USB three one versus a
thunderbolt one and we're using a USB
three hub versus a more expensive
Thunderbolt hub but if you were willing
to and had enough money to afford the
Thunderbolt 60 meter cable and that dock
I showed you before you could feasibly
have your display and peripherals an
entire house away from the actual
computer if you wanted to for some
reason ah now some of you are
undoubtedly watching this going why the
devil would I want a 30-meter USB cable
there are probably a dozen more
practical ways to do anything that
you've talked about here and on top of
that my case has front USB 3 so like a
meter has lots for me to which I would
respond yeah this kind of thing isn't
going to be practical for most people
this is more of a think of the
possibilities type of episode no PC can
be more silent than one that's not in
the same room right higher speed longer
distance data transfer is good for
everyone and seeing optical cables get
one step closer to mainstream allowing
us to do crazy stuff like this ah I just
I geeked out over this stuff I mean
they're not perfect yet the manual says
to only use self powered devices so
that's anything that's powered from the
wall and if you plug in a bus powered
device like a USB drive or a Wi-Fi
adapter directly it results in either
intermittent connectivity or power
errors but given that there isn't even a
standard for converting USB 3 to optical
like this it still makes my jaw drop to
see this black magic disk speed test
saturating the USB 3 bus on an SSD
that's literally a hundred feet away in
the back alley so thanks for watching
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you just liked it leave a
comment and let me know can you think of
anything that we didn't come up with for
what you
with a super long USB 3 cable or
Thunderbolt cable guys check out the
link in the video description to support
us you can buy a cool t-shirt like this
one give us a monthly contribution or
change your amazon bookmark to one with
our affiliate code so whenever you buy
really really long cables we get a small
kickback and I think that's pretty much
it thanks for watching Owen if anyone
from Corning is watching you know we'd
love to show off the 60 60 meter
Thunderbolt cable you know if you wanted
to send one of those to us shameless
request for a cable anyway I think
that's pretty much it guys thanks for
watching and as always don't forget to
