definitely heated up a fair bit with
heavyweight Apple allegedly selling more
of the first generation Apple watch
within days of its launch than every
other SmartWatch maker combined ever
pebbles original concept of offering
notifications on your wrist at a
reasonable price with cross-platform
compatibility is something that nothing
else addresses in quite the same way
which is why the original pebble
continues to be available in spite of
its lackluster hardware specs and
decidedly lesser build quality
especially when you hold it next to
something like an Apple watch or a moto
360 but that doesn't mean pebbles been
sitting on ass and today's video is
about the next-generation pebble the
pebble time by the way we're mostly back
on track as far as production scheduling
goes so throw a like below the video if
you're stoked to finally see our
skylight coverage John is hard at work
on that as we speak
strop is offering a killer deal on a DJI
phantom 3 so if you're into Jones scroll
down and check out that link in the
video description to get yours now so
let's start with what pebble hasn't
changed since the original the pebble
time is still water resistant to 30
meters only this time but it works for
reals I've gone swimming with mine lots
of times although I do that with the
Apple watch too and had no issues
it features multi day battery life with
an always-on display I'll be showing you
the time they say 7 days but in practice
I get closer to 4 or 5 since I'm a bit
of a heavier user
it features backwards compatibility with
the rich third-party app ecosystem for
the original pebble with everything from
GoPro remote control to ringing your
phone remotely to find it - fitness
trackers that use the onboard sensors -
pretty advanced music control usable
whether the app has been updated for the
new color display or not pretty cool now
let's get into the things that are
different the big one as I just alluded
to is the display the original pebble
used a 144 by 168 resolution ePaper
display which because ePaper requires no
backlight to function and only needs to
be powered when the image is changing is
what made it readable in direct sunlight
and allowed it to achieve such monstrous
battery life compared to its competitors
at the time which there weren't really
any and in fact compared to its
competitors now but being low resolution
and monochrome in the Year 2015 is just
not as cool as it was in the 1980s so
the pebble time features a color ePaper
display unfortunately from my experience
with the pebble time the viewing angles
are so poor sometimes and the color is
so washed out that it feels a little bit
more like a novelty not to mention that
the resolution itself has not been
upgraded meaning that text is just plain
not very sharp although this was done to
preserve that backwards app
compatibility that I praised like a
minute and a half ago so I guess I could
live with that
if they could at least fix the viewing
angle issues there are more improvements
though the pebble time features a super
easy to use band swapping system that
will even allow custom
add on bands to enhance functionality in
the future with ideas like extended
battery packs that could last for like a
month and additional sensors like GPS
being available for upgrading the pebble
time after the fact the next big one for
me is the microphone
unlike Android where you can't just
gesture and start talking at your watch
to a start a navigation do wherever I
want to go and you definitely can't hold
a conversation just through your watch
like the Apple watch thanks to its
surprisingly good mic and speaker but
honestly what I mostly use the mic on my
watch for is for quickly responding to
texts or emails something that the
pebble time handles really really well I
find that for the most efficiency it
does require the use of both of my hands
since it weights quite a while to stop
listening if you don't press the button
again to indicate that you're finished
talking but voice detection was quick
and accurate compared to other devices
that I've used which leads us to some
general analysis of my experience with
the pebble time versus its competitors
being platform agnostic is great I had
no difficulty controlling my google play
music connected to so no speakers right
out of the box something I couldn't do
with the Apple watch Facebook
Authenticator was flawless out of the
box it popped up a notification gave me
the context appropriate option of
opening on my phone and pops the number
right after the lockscreen and all of my
google junk worked flawlessly with even
fairly deep options for actions that I
could perform on things like my Gmail
messages I also absolutely loved tactile
buttons I mean I cannot say this enough
this is a huge thing that's missing with
other smartwatches for me which require
you to be looking at them to do
something as simple as change a song
something I do with my watch a lot if
you can memorize a couple of button
presses then you can actually perform
certain controls without ever even
looking at it which you might argue
doesn't matter
I mean Linus how much time are you
really saving by not looking at your
watch to press next track to which I
would respond this thing is made for
people who bought it to save the four
seconds it takes to get their phone out
of their pocket of course it matters the
pebble time isn't perfect though the
animations between menus are actually
kind of annoying
remember pebble this is a product for
impatient people and some of them are so
long it just feels like they're kind of
stalling so as you scroll through your
timeline it's quick but as you move
between days it's like this little Sun
pops up or something it's like they're
stalling to get more time also I really
don't like the way that the time gets
really tiny or even disappears out right
when you're looking at different screens
the calendar being one of them that did
irritate me
although the good news is that pebble
has been updating it actively I got an
update even while I was reviewing it
that significantly improved it so maybe
they'll see this video and maybe change
that but the last thing though is that
this might just be my unit or it might
be a power saving measure to allow for
that fancy color screen but I really
need to flick my wrist to illuminate the
backlight for viewing in the dark
something that I didn't really have to
do on my original pebble so the bottom
line then am i switching to the pebble
time no it was so close it was so close
but I just can't get over the screen I
could live with the kind of washed out
colors and the hard to activate
backlight I could even live with the low
resolution but I will take the trade-off
of extra bulk and charging every night
with the G watch R in exchange for being
able to read it from any angle I think
if pebble could figure out how to get
there panel closer to the front plastic
this issue would go away from me and I
think they could convert me back but for
now I'm an Android wear user really for
now although if I was on the iPhone I
probably go for the pebble time to be
perfectly honest poor Apple watch and
it's kind of a shame that I won't be
switching to the pebble time permanently
because it means I won't get to wear
this super-sick D brand skinned orange
pebble time anymore the guys over there
did me up an orange one because they
knew I loved my original orange pebble
so much and the pebble time is not
available in that particular color but
of course that's what D brand exists to
deal with although it's good for other
stuff too because having a skin means
that even careless people like me are
less likely to scratch
they're sensitive electronics I whacked
my watch so hard at one point that I got
a bunch of painted drywall bits embedded
in the orange skin but I guess the fact
that I was able to clean it off is a
testament to the durability of D brand
skins and to the functionality thanks to
the vinyl wrap the watch housing wasn't
damaged at all root
so check out D brand comm /off crap what
is it pebble
- pebble thank you for that Nick - check
out all the different devices they
support and to see the colors they have
that aren't Orange I know not everyone
is into that don't mind the man behind
