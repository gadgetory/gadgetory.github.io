preferred choice of mice headsets and
mechanical keyboards of curse gaming
visit www.samhsa.gov/dtac i wanted to
make a point about the lifestyle of this
particular product by resting on this
here grassy embankment while i open it
up and show what you would look like
using this particular little 7-inch
tablet so this is a more value oriented
product so it's not like their
transformer series where it's got all
the bells and whistles and you can
attach it to like you know a keyboard
and all that kind of stuff this is using
a single a nine core so it's a via what
is it there's no agenda WM 8950 it's got
Wireless and a gig of memory 16 gigs of
storage that's emmc storage it's got a
very similar overall feel to it like a
very similar form factor to something
like a Google Nexus 7 and it's got a
very actually very stunning backing on
it here check that out so it's got a
diamond patterned back that's just got a
nice logo what I like about it is the
fact that it's textured so many guys are
going with smooth feels like I
personally hate the feel of the iPad
because it's so smooth on the back you
could easily just drop the thing whereas
this isn't quite rubberized but here I'm
gonna if you guys can hear that noise it
has a bit of grip enos to it
so you can actually hold the stupid
thing because a lot of the time you've
got all these new tablets that are
coming with thin enough bezels that you
can or thick enough bezels that you can
hold them here but it's hard to support
it because it's not grippy enough on the
back then the glass obviously won't
provide any of that so there you go it's
got it's got a good overall feel to it
in terms of functionality we've got or
in terms of buttons we've got the lock
button up here at the top which I'm
pressing to hopefully turn it on we've
got a volume rocker it comes with
android jelly bean 4.1 micro SD slot
love to see this on the value tablets
especially because they don't come with
that much storage 16 gigs onboard so you
can expand that with another 64 gigs if
you want microUSB for charging as well
data transfer on the other side not a
whole lot you've got a single speaker on
the back as well as a single microphone
port right there
and a single 1 megapixel camera on the
front of the device now let's have a
look at what a soos includes with this
guy so you got a warranty card cout
you've got another one in French you've
got a memo pad user manual you've got a
USB to microUSB cable as well as a
what's this guy gonna be is this a 1 amp
0.3 amp now 2 n 2 amp 5 volt output wall
wart so let's get it fired up and we'll
be back in just a moment so we've got
this bad boy fired up I brought up the
camera app just for the lawls you guys
aren't gonna be able to see anything
there because the Sun is directly behind
us but what I can do is I can show you a
video that I already took I've got the
screen on full brightness here so this
is what the usage scenario would
probably look like you know laying on
the grass opening with the gallery yeah
it's always open that with gallery so
it's actually usable even in an
extremely bright condition so our
cameras probably compensating for a
little bit up there but you can see how
how white I am here because the Sun is
directly in my face I can also barely
see anything but with the screen up full
brightness it's actually quite usable
now it is by the by all appearances a TN
panel so you do have some color shift
when you and when you angle it from side
to side but that's what we expect with
these value products it's only about a
hundred and seventy dollars and because
of jellybean even though the processor
is not as overpowered as something like
a nexus 7 it is reasonably responsive so
you can you know click conceal your apps
and browse between those and all that
because the project butter I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
checking out this unboxing and first
look at the Asus memo pad I think I did
miss something critical which was the
resolution which I believe was 1024 by
600 although I could be wrong about that
you'll have to give me a moment yeah
that was all the time I needed 1024 by
600 oh yeah will do my trademark
now HTC one size comparison so there's
the thickness this is a 4.3 inch
smartphone so I should give you some
idea how it will come
haier to a seven-inch tablet in terms of
the overall screen size don't forget to

unboxings reviews and other computer
