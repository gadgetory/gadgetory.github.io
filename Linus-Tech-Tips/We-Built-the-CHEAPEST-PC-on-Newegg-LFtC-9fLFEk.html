build your own PC they say it's cheaper
than a prebuilt they say but just how
cheaply can you build a completely new
system and what compromises would you
make if you were to do so to find out we
purchased this bag of potatoes oh and
also we built this PC ek water blocks is
all aluminium fluid gaming line-up
offers great custom grade water cooling
performance for an affordable price
learn more at the link in the video
description ok so the exact spec of the
cheapest PC you can build seems to vary
a bit depending on the day that you're
shopping for it and also just how
ghetto-fabulous you want to get but long
story short we ended up with something
but let's say usable for a hundred and
fifty $1.99 and to clarify the usable
bit there we actually had managed to
find a full system with this single core
intel celeron 440 that would have been a
dollar fifty one cheaper but
unfortunately the Acer motherboard it
was attached to was a lot funkier than
we at first thought and using it would
have required some heavy case
modification so we settled for this
slightly more expensive combo a
quad-core AMD a8 38 70 and this ECS
motherboard now even with the right
standoffs assembly of this thing was
nothing short of heroic
we dodged we spun we rolled away from
the sharp spiky insides of the Xion case
that we picked up for 23 bucks I swear
around every corner there must have been
a sharp piece of metal just waiting for
a finger to run across it finally though
still alive but not entirely unscathed
we fired our rig up and installed
Windows 10 and with it all assembled now
had a chance to look at what it was that
we'd created at which time we promptly
wished we hadn't because the build
quality of this thing is atrocious if
this were the subject of an LTT review
it would probably go a little something
like this
all of the materials of this product
feel super cheap because they are and
the whole system is lighter than some of
the laptops that we've reviewed recently
at least I'll give them credit for this
the outside of the case is mostly free
of sharp edges but I still wouldn't
recommend performing Leola reach-around
to plug something in in the dark if you
don't want to get bit by this here
Wildcat rare overall though in fairness
the look of the case isn't that bad and
it's not like it wouldn't be functional
if you are on a tight budget though the
inclusion of a rear case fan for exhaust
would have been a nice touch with that
said arguably our 400 watt power supply
does seem to take care of that job for
the most part probably because the
Coolmax I 400 runs its fan at full speed
as often as you should be using a condom
at a brothel
so that is 100 percent of the time in
all seriousness though even at idle this
system is uncomfortably loud due to that
fan and at full load once the CPU fan
joins the chorus you'll actually
probably be wishing for some earmuffs
the silver lining here at least is that
with all that noise you do get some
half-decent thermals with both the CPU
and GPU leveling off at around 64
degrees spec wise though huh well you
can forget about your favorite triple-a
games because this thing barely scrapes
by the minimum specs for Windows 10 I
mean the CPU is actually half decent for
38 bucks it's four cores at 3 gigahertz
feel
like they're being held back somewhat by
the rest of the system so for
productivity this box works reasonably
well once all the extra visuals are
disabled surfing the internet was
serviceable and even full HD YouTube
playback was nice and smooth at least
until we ran out of RAM and since
there's only two gigs of the stuff well
you can expect to be hitting the page
file every so often just kidding always
and all bad once you have to access the
hard drive any resemblance of haste goes
away at only 5400 rpm the 160 gigabytes
of storage is molasses low like type in
a search for one of the four blu-ray
movies that you could fit on it then
don't make a cup of tea while you wait
for the results but come on who cares
about hard drive performance let's
answer the burning question on all of
your minds can it game I mean the system
does have dedicated graphics so it
should be able to write ha the dedicated
I think indifferent graphics would
probably be a better term since our
GeForce 84 for TGS doesn't give too cold
it's about your frame rate coming in at
$19 it sports 256 Meg's of ddr2 memory
and with a dinosaur ik 460 megahertz
core clock its 3d mark score is 36 times
lower than that of the lowly gtx 750ti
that's right
not a gtx 1080 TI but the 750 Ti a card
that costs only 5 times as much so
needless to say in our tests we're going
for playable rather than pretty
half-life 2 then at 720p
medium to lowest details actually not
the worst gaming experience I've ever
had though that's more of an endorsement
of Valve's excellent storytelling than
this gaming PC and as for anything newer
than 2010 well you can forget about that
even csgo at 720p with the lowest
settings yields and absolutely
unplayable 10 frames per second but wait
Crysis was released before 2010 can it
can it run Crysis yes yes it can at 800
by 600 and the lowest settings and it's
actually somewhat playable which is cool
but we also wanted to bench our system
in such a way that you can compare it at
home so we booted up 3d mark where only
the ice storm benchmark for mobile
devices was able to run since everything
else required either a higher level of
DirectX support or more vram funny story
our GeForce 84 for TGS managed to score
of 4,000 989 which actually kind of
sounded like a big number until it got
absolutely bought wrecked by the 24,000
320 score recorded by the AMD integrated
GPU built in to our processor so I guess
then that spending that $19 on some
mountain Dew and Doritos would have had
a bigger impact on the gaming experience
so then with the GeForce 84 40 ripped
out actually the whole system got more
usable in general we managed almost 60
FPS in csgo at 720p low and GTA 5 well
hey it got the game to launch which at
this point we consider a win even if it
did only manage frame rates in the 20s
among other issues so bottom line would
we recommend this system absolutely not
I mean to be clear there's still a lot
of fun to be had with it I mean older
titles like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and
emulators worked awesome but this is a
lesson in smart spending even if you're
on a super tight budget the cheapest
thing on the market is almost never a
good value
so our previous guidance still stands
below a certain price point you really
are actually better off with a prebuilt
or going further down used hardware no
matter how many crack pipes you might
find in it is pretty much the way to go
blue apron lets you create delicious
chef designed meals at home they deliver
all the farm-fresh ingredients you need
right to your doorstep in exactly the
right proportions no trips to the
