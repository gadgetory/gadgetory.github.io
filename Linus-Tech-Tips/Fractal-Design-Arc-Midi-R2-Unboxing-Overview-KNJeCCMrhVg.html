description to learn more about the
adata - drive air AE 400 welcome to my
unboxing and overview of the fractal
design Arc MIDI r2 which takes pretty
much everything that was good about the
original art committee and well improves
upon it so what they were going for was
not only an excellent air cooling case
which the arc MIDI was in fact my wife's
PC is still running it in our committee
but they wanted to add flexible liquid
cooling support to it as well because
whether you're using an all-in-one or a
completely custom loop many of the kids
today are adding water cooling to their
systems so in terms of the overall specs
we've got a pretty nondescript Plain
Jane brown box maximum airflow with a
sleek and minimalistic front panel
design in fact they haven't changed that
much their front intake now includes an
easy to clean dust filter this was one
of my complaints about the original arc
was it just left kind of like horrible
dust rings on it and there wasn't really
a whole lot you could do about it
front interface includes USB 3 which the
old one did as well top panel design for
maximum airflow which it was before as
well and the stylish windowed side panel
made from acrylic allows you to see your
components that's their other way of
saying that it has a window to separate
hard drive cages can be moved around
individual hard drive cage feature
vibration dampening rubber grommets and
three high quality 140 millimeter silent
fans and extensive water cooling support
in the top panel and behind the front
panel so I'm not going to spend too much
time opening the box that my friends is
how we do it and we find a hard foam
which is not my favorite I do like to
see soft or closed-cell foams but I
understand that from a cost-savings
perspective sometimes hard foams are a
necessary evil from the manufacturing
side and as long as they're reasonably
well designed they can protect the case
so I'm just going to go ahead and see if
I can pop that back in place it looks
like that came loose and shipping
speaking of hard foam and hating it at
least they've gone for about an inch of
thickness on the corners here so I've
definitely seen worse
let's go ahead and open this bad boy up
so the first thing we're going to see I
guess is the bottom of the case this is
unusual we never do this so it's got two
different sizes of feet large ones on
the front of the case small ones on the
back as well as a removable fan filter
which you can see you can simply slide
out like this not too long which was a
problem with older cases particularly
the Corsair 800 D where the fan filter
on the bottom was enormous so it meant
that you had to slide it out that far in
order to get it out which meant you
usually hit the wall or some other sort
of obstacle so this one is sort of like
a dual 140 millimeter size you've also
got a little air intake here so you'll
get a little bit more airflow for the
front however I don't think that's going
to be a major factor in cooling for this
case because most of its going to be
coming through the fairly open front
mesh since the front panel is the part
of the case that we're repairing here we
might as well show you how this front
piece goes on so this is what they meant
by easy to remove and easy to clean it's
one solid piece of metal mesh with a
sort of foam filter behind it that
should allow air to pass through pretty
easily but will also provide very
effective dust catching you can probably
take this whole thing and just kind of
dip it in water and soap and wash it out
and you can see we've got one 140
millimeter Clint fan included in the
front although there's room to mount an
additional one but we'll also see here
is a wide variety of different mounting
holes these will allow you to mount
things like dual 120 millimeter
radiators in the front of the case which
you might say by the way it goes in like
this click which you might say well line
is how will you have room for that I'll
show you once we open it up to five and
a quarter inch bays around out the clean
front bezel that looks very similar to
the original here we don't know that's
clicked into place on the top we find
once again very very open open free
airflow so that is the arc concept as
well as i/o including a reset switch
that can't be accidentally pressed by a
cat that jumps on your case a microphone
and headphone jack power as well as a
power indicator LED to USB 3 ports which
is an improvement over the old one which
only had one as well as integrated fan
control with 5 volt 7 volt and 12 volt
switches on this side if we find not a
whole lot just a plain side panel and
then on the other side we find the win
side panel that was alluded to in a very
verbose fashion on the outside of the
box and it has a protective plastic
cover that I actually don't seem to be
able to remove so the good news is your
window will look as good as it does out
of the box forever the bad news is it
looks like but because there's air
bubbles I don't know I'm just kidding I
got it oh I thought I had it oh there's
another one on the inside anyway it's a
bit of a frosted sort of well not
frosted it's a smoked smoke panel so
it's going to look a little bit darker
inside it's up to the individual whether
they prefer that or the clear side panel
but there you go it has a bit of a bit
of a different look to it so on the back
we find another 140 millimeter included
Faneuil though with optional mounts for
120 mil as well as seven PCI slots and
then an additional auxiliary one where
you can put something like a fan
controller or whatever else a bottom
mounted power supply has a noise
dampening foam around it so to give you
guys some idea just how smoked that side
panel is I'm gonna go ahead and remove
the inside piece and you can look at me
with or without the smoke there you go
so it makes things a little bit darker
but if you have lighting effects inside
your case it's probably not going to
affect things too much but if you don't
have lighting effects then it will look
significantly dimmer inside once we get
inside the case we find out how all of
this is supposed to work so up here in
the top there's that flexible radiator
support so there's another 140
millimeter fan included but you can see
there are a butt ton of different
mounting points for different sized fans
so you could put up to a triple 120
millimeter radiator up here without any
difficulty but you would be sacrificing
some of that five and a quarter inch
expansion now in order to make this
easier all you have to do is remove two
screws here in the back one of which I
have pre loosened and the other one
looks like it's gonna be a problem for
me and then you can remove the entire
top of the case just like you could on
the v1 chassis so there you have it so
here's dual 140 millimeter mounting
points as well as triple 120 millimeter
mounting points you can actually put
another pun 40 over here should you so
desire although I don't know that that's
something
that I would necessarily recommend
sacrificing a five and a quarter inch
pay for now in the front of the case
that's where things are also quite
interesting because you can remove this
top one so you can fit a reasonably long
graphics card in here in fact anything
that's on the market currently pretty
much without removing it but you can
remove it to give you the option to
install even longer graphics cards in
order to give yourself more options at
the front of the case you can also check
this out
screws down here remove the second hard
drive cage meaning that you can only
mount bail you can mount things
creatively pretty much at that point so
you could go ahead and put SSDs on the
back of the motherboard tray more on
that later but you could also put nice
thick radiators here in the front
without any difficulty at all more
flexibility for the drive cages though
if you're one of those people who says
we'll look at this guys look at this in
profile
not much airflow can get through here
and you don't mind having cables
sticking out the back of your hard drive
area you can actually check this in this
way instead of the default which is
sideways mounted if I could figure out
how to do it and it would be great yeah
there we go so now you get more
free-flowing airflow especially if
you're not installing all five drives in
there so fractal design is saying they
have twenty six millimeters of cable
management space behind the motherboard
tray I believe it so there's quite a lot
of space you can easily fit a 24 pin
cable back here they've also gone with
what I really like to see which is a
much larger grommet down here at the
bottom than the ones that are up here
along the side because most of the
cables are going to have to come through
here before they go up to the eight pin
which also has rubber grommets back
there or the eight pin that's positioned
where I hate having it positioned in the
middle at the top 24 pin PCI Express as
well as anything that goes up here to
your five and a quarter inch drive cages
on the back we find the two-and-a-half
inch SSD mounts that I talked about
before these are very basic SSD mounts
and you actually have to screw into the
bottom of the SSDs from where the
motherboard would sit so it's not as
elegant as fractals implementation of
this feature on other cases and I'd
really recommend just using velcro or
double-sided tape or something to stick
those on there also on the back of the
case we find the power as
well as the splitter leads for the
built-in fan controller so it uses a
single molex for power and then it also
is able to control up to 3 fans using a
simple voltage control and not providing
any RPM monitoring and so there's lots
of room for cable management in the back
not as many cable tie loops as I'd like
to see so there's only a couple rows of
them here and here I like to see some
cable tie loops leading up to the 8 pin
if I was to criticize something about
the cable management in this case which
is of course what you people pay me good
money to do internal hookups are oh well
I've moved them before apparently I was
ready to go with those at the front are
the standard fare so there's a USB 3
connector and it's sort of standard
bulky form as well like to see this
check this out a USB 2 connector so you
can't hook them both up at the same time
but this gives you the option to plug
into USB 2 if your motherboard doesn't
support USB 3 without a weird funky
adapter HD audio is included as well as
your power switch reset switch and hard
drive LED and power LED all of these are
black cables which is a definite plus
last but not least this is something
I've been forgetting on a lot of cases
lately let's go ahead and check out what
they include in terms of accessories but
I'm going to go ahead and use my
divining powers to predict screws okay
so nothing unexpected some screws some
cable ties and not a whole lot else
although they do include one of those
handy dandy little adapters so that you
can use your screwdriver to put in the
there they are the motherboard standoffs
I do like those those are useful way to
go fractal don't forget to subscribe to
