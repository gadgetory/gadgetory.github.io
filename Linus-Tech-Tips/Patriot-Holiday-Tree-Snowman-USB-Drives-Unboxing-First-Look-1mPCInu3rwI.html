don't think I've ever actually done a
video about them in the past but they do
do up special designs pretty much every
year that I've been aware of last couple
years anyway of USB keys that come in
special holiday designs so these are
great stocking stuffers I'm gonna go
ahead and open up the 8gig Snowman
remember Patriot technology is one of
the few memory guys that actually still
manufacture some products in the United
United States I mean a lot of my viewers
are not in the United States but why
don't I say North America so that at
least it's somewhat relevant to most of
the viewers so they do still actually
manufacture product in North America
this guy right here comes with a
two-year warranty driverless support for
most operating systems and it is
compliant with high-speed USB - there's
nothing really else on here in terms of
its Beck although that is pretty much to
be expected yeah I know right
because really these are intended is
cute little stocking stuffers and not a
whole lot more you can see these
snowman's bum comes off and then you go
ahead and plug the USB thing in and here
I can show you how big the actual USB
key itself is if you guys are curious
there you go
see that's how big it is the rest of its
just casing that looks cute
so for tech savvy moms who want to get
something for the impossible to please
gig these are adorable they're you know
useful and hey check this out they even
come with they even come with a keychain
attachable little piece here which we
can go ahead and string through the top
of the Snowman here and then attach to
something just like this my keys are not
in my wall
I mean my keys are not in my pocket not
my wallet my keys are never in my wallet
that be one bulky askest Enza wallet
okay there we go
and don't worry I'll figure this out at
some point
yeah there we go so that is what the
Snowman USB Drive will look like when it
is attached to your keychain isn't it
adorable let's go ahead and open up the
Christmas tree or rather the oh man
really the holiday tree oh you know what
I'm gonna go ahead and call it the
Christmas tree because my calendar says
Christmas not holiday so that's why I'm
putting up a tree I don't know about you
guys but whatever okay so there we go
there's my Hollett nope no I can't do it
because there's my Christmas tree with
my candy canes and my popcorn and little
bobbles and star on the top the star
obviously signifying the North Star
because the North Star guides everyone
through life regardless of their
particular faith no that's not why the
stars on top and then on the bottom we
have our USB and we go ahead and pull
that out when you discover that actually
it's the same thing with a different
holiday themed covering on it which
anyone who knows anything about USB
drives probably already knew but there
you go so here is the tree and I'm gonna
go ahead I'm gonna take the Snowman back
off my keychain so that I can hold it up
and compare it next to the tree so the
tree is the four gig the Snowman is the
eight gig or rather I should say snow
person since I'm being so politically
correct in this particular video thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Patriot snow person and holiday tree
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer video hey by the way my
new assistant who shall henceforth be
known as slick asked me of what this is
for and I told him it is to hold the cap
while you are using the USB Drive then
you can take it off here and put it here
and it's adorable again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
