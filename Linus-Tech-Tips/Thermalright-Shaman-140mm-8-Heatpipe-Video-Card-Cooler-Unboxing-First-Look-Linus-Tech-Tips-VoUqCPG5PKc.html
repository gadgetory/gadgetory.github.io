thermal right so this is the shaman or
Shaymin depending how you prefer to
pronounce it and this is an eight heat
pipe VGA cooler it comes in their
traditional cardboard box and let's go
ahead and get this guy opened up and
find out well what it's all about okay
so the first thing we're going to find
is a little exploded view that's acting
as a few different things so first of
all it is and it seems like it's an
instruction guide although the
instructions are on the back here for
how to mount these Shaymin okay the
example they've used is a GTX 480 you
can tell from the PCB cut out for the
fan although the GTX 480 uses most of
the same mounting points as the GTX 580
so you'd have to check the thermal right
site for confirmation but I would
imagine it would also be compatible with
the 580 now that that's released so you
can see here are all the officially
supported graphics card so wow it goes
back as far as the 38 50 and then up is
current as the 480 and like I said I
suspect that the 580 would also be
supported okay here we've got a little
contents list so what we're expecting to
find inside and then the next thing we
have is one of thermal writes 140
millimeter fans as I mentioned in one of
my previous unboxings I have tried out
this fan myself and I do quite like it
so you can be confident in using that
fan with your new Shaymin that you are
having the best experience possible in
terms of a balance between air flow as
well as noise so I want to put away the
knife that I had just used to hear it
okay so let's get this opened up here
this is the assembly package and inside
you will find everything we need for
assembly so we're going to find some of
these little rubber strips which are for
dampening the noise made by the fan okay
because this is a performance as well as
silence optimized product so thermal
writes design goal when they're figuring
out how to build the best aftermarket
vga coolers they want to make it quieter
and better performance than the OEM
cooler so in order to achieve that they
they have to put a lot of thought into
it so these are one of the
that has come out of that particular
design objective to reduce the overall
noise made by your graphics card so
here's a couple fan Clips that you will
also need to mount the fan on to the
Shaymin alright we've bought some
thermal compound cf3 from thermal write
chill factor 3 and then we have one set
of mounting hardware Wow that keeps it
simple does it so you've got your non
conductive backing on there so that's a
plastic backing and then the metal is as
I've come to expect from thermal right
thick robust and native steel so you're
not going to have any issues with that
backplate flexing on you here's a
variety of mosfet as well as RAM coolers
okay and let's get a little bit further
in here wow this thing looks ridiculous
actually that's awesome alright oh hey I
missed the thermal write sticker there
it is that's nice okay so by the time
you put a fan on this guy it's going to
be a triple flaw cooling solution so as
long as you're aware of that going into
it bear in mind that triple slot isn't
as big of a deal now as it used to be
because there are so many graphics are
so many motherboards out there that
allow you to have to triple slot cards
in SLI or crossfire so bear that in mind
if you are going to be adding a shame
into your system shortly now this does
use eight heat pipes and I just love
this check this out
the maze of heat pipes over here looks
outstanding I want you to get a couple
different angles of that because it just
looks so cool to have all of those heat
pipes to sort of bent around and wrapped
around each other because I mean really
we're talking about fitting all of these
precision manufactured so that they all
kind of Bend in and around each other
and they all go to the same base right
here now look how big the bases on this
compared to a CPU cooler also we'll do
the obligatory look how shiny it is and
it does use a convex base look how big
the base is compared to a CPU that's
because a GPU die is typically quite a
bit bigger so on a CPU it'd be hard to
optimize it to actually make use of
eight heat pipes lying side-by-side
because the CPU die is so small and
that's where all the heat comes from
whereas the GPU die under that you jeet
spreader
able to spread it out a little bit more
so we can actually get more cooling
performance by spreading it out so
here's our hold down which you can see
thermal right has thoughtfully provided
screws for which you can actually use to
remove the hold down and replace it with
something else later when you want to
upgrade your graphics card and then
we've got the top here so these are all
soldered down you can see like how
low-profile it is when I really hold it
up this way and that's what'll Herrin
well go ahead and put the fan on it so
you can see exactly how thick it is
compared to a one hunt standard so this
is a twenty five mill 140 millimeter fan
just like that check that out again that
looks so cool now in terms of
performance I can't really speculate but
I would go ahead and assume because
thermal right designed it that is going
to pretty much Rock anything else and
thank you for checking out my unboxing
