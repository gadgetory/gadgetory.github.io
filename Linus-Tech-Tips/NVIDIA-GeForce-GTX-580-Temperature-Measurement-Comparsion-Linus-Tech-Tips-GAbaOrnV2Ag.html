without a Linus tech tips evaluation of
the temperatures of the new card under
idle and load conditions so remember
that the load that I'm going to show you
today is going to be kind of a worst
case scenario running fir mark and the
idle is well that's that's a pretty
typical scenario but it's still a bit of
a best-case because I am running on an
open test bench and your CPU CPU Wow
your computer case is actually going to
keep things a little bit toasty er than
an open test bench just because of the
recycling of the air that's being used
to cool the components so our idle
temperature for this brand-new GPU from
Nvidia is actually 38 degrees and it
does that at a fan speed of about 40
percent well exactly 40 percent which
equates to almost 1,400 rpm and yeah so
that's fairly straightforward isn't it
so I'll show you the low temperatures as
well as compare it to its predecessor
which was often criticized for running
too hot the GTX 480 for the GPU load
comparison on the GTX 580 you can see
I've got fir mark running here in
extreme burning mode and you can see the
the rise in temperature while I held a
piece of paper over the intake of the
fan so that it wouldn't so that I
wouldn't heat up pretty quickly so that
I could get my results and you can see
it actually settled down into a
temperature of 69 degrees Celsius okay
you can see that is backed up by
afterburner over here with the fan
running at about 53 to 54 percent which
is about 1920 rpm so it's not bad at all
nuts quite cool compared to other Fermi
based cards mind you this is GF 110 not
GF 100 that we're talking about it's a
whole new beast the idle reading for the
GTX 480 really does tell the story
despite this card being significantly
less powerful than the fighting
it runs significantly and I am over
using that word hotter than the GTX 580
so it idles at a whopping 47 degrees and
that's with a fan rpm of over 1500 RPM
bear in mind these are using a fairly
similar fan although the cooler design
is quite different because the GTX 480
uses heat pipes whereas the GTX 580
actually uses a vapor chamber design
that is hidden by the plastic shroud so
if you weren't aware already yes GTX 480
s
reputation for running toasty is well
enough deserved so we've got the fan rpm
up around almost 3000 rpm with a speed
of 71% and we are still at 92 degrees
that's very very hot especially
considering we are running on an open
test platform in a reasonable
temperature room now when you have a GTX
480 running non-stop in in a normal
sized room it will actually heat up the
room several degrees so that fan is
actually going to go higher when it's
inside a case in a warmer room so the
GTX 580 is a huge improvement over the
GTX 480 in that regard I sure wish I had
something newer from AMD to compare
against the GTX 580 wink-wink
nudge-nudge but I guess the 5870 will
this have to do for now so you can see
we're running at above 38 degrees and
that is with a fan speed percentage of
only about 20 percent so we'll show you
the load temperatures and that'll be in
just a moment so I guess we kind of know
this already but there we go the 5870
it's been on the market for a while it
loads at about 85 degrees with a fan
speed of yeah only about 37% so you
could tweak the fan profile a little bit
if you wanted set it up so that that fan
ramps up a little bit more and gives you
a better temperatures but honestly it's
not necessary it's designed to run just
fine
that temperature like I said will have
something better to compare this with
the 580 against compare against the 580
from AMD fairly soon thank you for
checking out my video on the
temperatures of the GTX 580 against its
nearest competitors and the single GPU
