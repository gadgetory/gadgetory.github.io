in fact it's super cool but can cool
replace the laptop yeah at least it can
depending on what it is you would need
to do with your laptop like for example
if you need to protect your laptop or
tablet and make it look awesome well
then our sponsor D brand works just as
well for the iPad pro as it does for a
laptop making it look sweet and
protecting it from incidental scuffs and
scratches check out D brand at link in
the video description
so tablets are going through kind of a
crisis of identity right now like if
they were people they'd be in their sort
of early 20s Who am I Faye's you see
when the first iPad came out it was
understood to be a new class of device
that exists in addition to the ones that
you already have not as a replacement
for them then the novelty wore off and
people started asking themselves wait
what was the point of these again that's
when we started seeing an attempt for
manufacturers to marry the qualities of
a tablet and a laptop Microsoft was
among the first to popularize this
fusion with their surface line tablets
that ran windows and could be paired
with a super-thin keyboard a mouse and a
pen then came the two-in-ones
which were full laptops whose touch
screen displays could be swiveled or
outright removed and then used in tablet
mode and then finally Apple formally
joins The Fray in 2015 with the first
iPad to be marketed as a laptop
substitute the original iPad pro it was
actually kind of bizarre like they even
had Microsoft join them on stage during
the announcement to talk about how you
could be super productive using office
on the new iPad so was this it had Apple
blessed the world's best tablet with an
actual function that is beyond
distracting our cats so they won't
bother us while we get work done on a
real computer well Apple clearly feels
that they did because it looks like the
iPad pro is here to stay it got a minor
hardware revision last year and a
complete overhaul now for 2018 so we've
got the 11 inch model here but there's
also the 12 point 9 inch model both of
which boasts increased screen to body
ratios
thanks to their edge to edge screens
though it isn't entirely clear which
edge Apple is talking about because I
still see a bezel and it's even got a
more utilitarian physical design with
square edges like a macbook pro they've
thrown in there faster eight core a 12 X
Bionic processor which is supposedly 92%
faster than all the portable PCs and has
Xbox one s-class graphics performance
whatever those mean there's face ID
faster and more secure than touch ID and
USB type-c which actually makes this the
most computer-like tablet ever from
Apple thanks to its ability to connect
to external displays and a vast number
of accessories finally they launched a
new Apple pencil which now snaps
magnetically to the side of the iPad pro
2 pair and charged personally I actually
kind of liked the old way but no I'm
just kidding I was horrible I can't
believe this took three years go Apple
but none of what I just said
address is the biggest difference
between a MacBook and an iPad with a
keyboard iOS and it's here that Apple
has done a fairly admirable job of
tweaking iOS to be more like a desktop
operating system using apps and
split-screen is still nice and the a 12
X chip actually makes everything super
fast like it's impressive how smoothly
and quickly everything occurs on the
iPad pro and it's made even more snappy
by the pro motion display with its
adaptive 120 Hertz refresh rate but the
fact is iOS is still missing some
critical features that it needs to be a
standalone computer for pro fessional x'
here are some of those features in no
particular order one a true file manager
the iOS files app only shows your iCloud
drive what to support for external
storage we finally have an iOS device
with USB type-c but it won't recognize a
thumb drive
you know what Apple three better
external display support you can connect
displays via USB C directly or through
an adapter but it always just duplicates
your iPad screen unless your specific
app supports a second screen experience
for there's still no keyboard and mouse
support so if you're using it in laptop
mode with the keyboard you have to reach
up and touch the screen any time you
want to navigate like you're a chimp
5.the
pencil is sort of useful as a mouse
analog except that you still have to
switch between your fingers and the
pencil to perform certain actions like
navigating between apps and going to the
home screen that's why this guy got so
good at twirling it six the keyboard
folio only lets the iPad sit at two
angles which honestly is just
unacceptable in a world that also
contains the surface pros friction hinge
7 there's no headphone jack I'm sorry
but I'm still salty look how big it is
how about it maybe even just on the
twelve point nine inch right they got
the same hardware so how can a pro
accept these kinds of compromises well
the answer is that there are many
different types of pros professional
artists professional writers
professional video editors accountants
scientists business owners brand
managers each of these professions
warrants a different answer to the
question of whether the iPad pro can
replace a laptop I think probably the
best angle you could take on that front
would be artists the pencil and the iPad
pro together are extremely impressive
the precision responsiveness and overall
feel is quite possibly the best
available on anything other than a
high-end Wacom tablet so artists then
guide they can probably replace their
computer at this right baby illustrators
and graphic designers at the verge got
to try an early version of Photoshop for
the iPad pro and one of the photo
editors shared that while it was cool
she missed her keyboard shortcuts and I
think that kind of says it in a nutshell
doesn't it it can but professionals who
professionally you know hit their
deadlines and stuff will probably share
similar concerns don't get me wrong the
iPad pro has all the things that people
use a computer for a web browser apps
games even an available keyboard the
whole iPad pro can be your next computer
thing is true
it's just only true for a small
percentage of the people who we would
traditionally described as pros for
everyone else the iPad pro is still a
secondary device something you have in
addition to your real computer in other
words it's a tablet but ok before we you
know bang the gavel and pronounce
judgment on this thing let's pretend for
a moment that we are an artiste
contemplating replacing our computer
with the iPad pro that's where pricing
comes into it this device starts at
$7.99 for the 64 gig 11 inch monitor add
the keyboard and pencil that's $1,100
but then if you're using this as your
primary machine you're probably gonna
want the 12 point 9 inch one and let's
give you 256 gigs of storage as well
that one's 1150 so then the keyboard and
pencil brings us to 1450 you know what
else you can get for around that price
the brand spanking new surface pro 6
oh yeah totally forgot Microsoft has a
tablet running full Windows 10 with a
core i5 also 256 gigs of storage
excellent
keyboard trackpad Mouse support and a
pen which isn't quite as good as the
Apple pencil but it's pretty freakin
good and it's actually less than
fourteen hundred and fifty dollars now
I'm not gonna come out and say that
anyone who's considering the iPad pro
should just get a surface pro instead
but if you are considering an iPad pro
as your main computer you might want to
consider a surface pro or at the very
least you better be pretty dang sure
that you need that special Apple pencil
experience so that you can create an
artfully Illustrated itinerary of your
vacation to Maine because to me that is
this devices primary selling point I
mean perhaps we shouldn't be surprised
that Apple is selling a device more on
the premise of what it could be used for
and their vision for the future of
computing rather than what you the
end-users are actually going to use this
doodad to achieve that's kind of been
their jam for a while but maybe that's
okay
like if you don't go in expecting the
iPad pro or tablets like it to replace
your laptop you are probably going to be
pretty darn happy with this thing and I
think that it's enough to say that this
is an incredible tablet that is more
powerful and capable than most other
tablets in its class because it really
makes the most sense to me out of any
other tablet as a companion device like
the surface line it's more like
two-in-ones laptops that can be used as
tablets as for this well this is a
tablet that can be used as a laptop
maybe I'm wrong
perhaps powerful tablets that can do it
all are the future of computing but the
main issue today is that Apple is not
going to lead us there
with iOS in my opinion what they need to
do is make mac OS more touch friendly or
make iOS much more robust because as it
stands the iPad pro can replace your
computer but it shouldn't speaking of
things that shouldn't we shouldn't do
