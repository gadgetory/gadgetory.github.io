merc this is the oh well done there's
two versions there's the Alpha with the
window and then there's the beta which
does not wait fun now I'm confused well
we have the Alpha so we're going to find
out exactly what that is once we get it
opened up so big Phoenix has been
releasing a number of fairly interesting
cases one of the things that really sets
them apart from their competition is
their soft feel or soft touch finish
which basically feels instead of like a
painted metal or like plastic kind of
like a velvety velvety soft plastic and
I don't know how to describe it other
than you know high-end gaming mice how
they often have like a bit of a
rubberized or like a soft grip to them
get kind of like that and at some point
the case comes out of the box and at
that point in time and no sooner we can
take a closer look at so value gaming
cases ouch Oh shakli value gaming cases
are no new thing for bitfenix we had a
look at the outlaw little while ago
which was kind of cool because it used
that altered ATX style and it was as far
as I can tell the least expensive
case to ever use that design so here we
go with the Mercs oh haha the Alpha has
the cooling panel on the side so this
basically does not look like we can
mount a 120-millimeter fan but I
wouldn't be that surprised if you could
kind of like kajigger it to to work so
hold on a second let's just grab a fan
here you so let's see it looks like it
does line up yeah so you can just use
the the outside holes here in order to
screw a fit in if you really wanted cool
okay maybe they intended that surely
they intended that they call it a
cooling side panel so the alpha has
cooling side panel to buy 120-millimeter
optional so yeah I haven't come up with
anything new here so on the top we've
got dual 120-millimeter fans as well and
then on the back we have an additional
120 millimeter fan you can also mount a
92 or an 80 millimeter fan on the back
should you see fit a couple of water
cooling holes we've got seven expansion
slots in this particular case so you're
going to be fitting standard ATX
motherboards only in here let's have a
closer look at the front before we get
any further actually this case does not
have soft touch so this is meant to be
more of a straight value case we've gone
a three and a half inch expansion bay 25
and 35 and a quarter inch expansion base
mesh at the front here and on the top we
have four USB 2.0 microphone headphones
power and reset switches so let's go
ahead and take the side panel up here
which hopefully i can do not there we go
comes out this way okay we've got our
front panel connectors these are all
covered in a black la heat shrink and
then here he drink at the end and then
just a black sleeving so we've got our
HD audio we've got two USB front panel
connectors and then last but not least
we've got our front power presets which
hard drive LEDs and all that good stuff
in
Leo doesn't look like really much of
anything to two different from what
we've seen in the past from a variety of
different cases so hard drive wise we've
got one two three four five six seven
three and a half inch hard drives we've
got another 120 millimeter fan here in
the bottom so in terms of cooling
there's a fair number of options that
are available to you I'm just going to
go ahead and pull this out so there are
two 120 millimeter cooling fan positions
on the front and if you go ahead and
squeeze these together comes out a lot
more easily I suspect oh interesting
having a bit of trouble here give me a
sec guys got it guys I just had to heave
on it a little bit so we've got to 120
millimeter cooling fans here in the
front looks like you can also mount 92s
if you so desire so you can use those to
cool your drives here you can see the
inside of the case as a whole so there's
the interface for the front panel what
not but I can't really think of any good
reason why you there we go want to
disconnect those so we'll just leave
those attached what else we got here cpu
cutout is right here so it's a fairly
small CPU cut out but as long as your
CPU socket isn't sort of more to the
right then you shouldn't have too much
trouble reaching a backplate cpu cooler
and replacing it without actually
removing the motherboard from the case I
guess there's not too much else to say
bottom mounted power supply um 120mm fan
here 2 120's in the front all black
interior which may or may not matter to
you because you can see inside the case
a little bit but it's going to be less
if you actually mount fans here so there
that should give you guys some idea of
how much you can actually see down into
the case so I do like the all black
interiors but i'm personally more more
inclined to say it's necessary if you do
have a side panel window so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
