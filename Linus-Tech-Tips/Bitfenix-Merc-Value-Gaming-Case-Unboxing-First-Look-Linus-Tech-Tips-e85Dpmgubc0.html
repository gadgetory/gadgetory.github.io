Merc this is the open well done there's
two versions there's the alpha with the
window and then there's the beta which
does not wait now I'm confused well we
have the alpha so we're going to find
out exactly what that is once we get it
opened up so big phoenix has been
releasing a number of fairly interesting
cases one of the things that really sets
them apart from their competition is
their soft feel or soft touch finish
which basically feels instead of like a
painted metal or like plastic like a
velvety velvety soft plastic and I don't
know how to describe it other than you
know high-end gaming mice how they often
have like a bit of a rubberized or like
a soft grip to them it's kind of like
that and at some point the case comes
out of the box and at that point in time
and no sooner we can take a closer look
at so value gaming cases ouch shock
value gaming cases are no new thing for
mechanics we had a look at the outlaw a
little while ago which was kind of cool
because it used that altered ATX style
and it was as far as I can tell the
least
to ever use so here we go with the Mercs
oh haha the Alfa has the cooling panel
on the side so this basically does not
look like we can mount a 120 millimeter
fan but I'm going to be that surprised
if you could kind of like to jigger it
to to work so hold on a second let's
just grab yeah so let's see it looks
like it does line up yeah so you can
just use the the outside holes here in
order to screw a vent in if you really
wanted okay
maybe they intended that surely they
intended that they call it a cooling
side panel so the Alfa has cooling side
panel to by 120 millimeter optional see
I haven't come up with anything new here
so on the top we've got dual 120
millimeter fans as well and then on the
back we have an additional 120
millimeter fan you can also mount a 92
or an 80 millimeter fan on the back
should you see fit a couple water
cooling holes we've got seven expansion
slots in this particular case so you're
gonna be fitting standard ATX
motherboards only in here let's have a
closer look at the front before we get
any further actually this case does not
have soft touch so this is meant to be
more of a straight value case we've gone
a three and a half inch expansion Bay to
five and a three five and a quarter inch
expansion base mesh at the front here
and on the top we have four USB 2.0
microphone headphone power and reset
switches so let's go ahead and take the
side panel off here which hopefully I
can do not there we go comes out this
way okay we've got our front panel
connectors these are all covered in a
black heat shrink and then here heat
shrink at the end and then just a blacks
leaving so we've got our HD audio we've
got two USB front panel connectors and
then last but not least we've got our
front our presets which hard drive LEDs
and all that good stuff in
sadly Oh doesn't look like really much
of anything too too different from what
we've seen in the past from a variety of
different cases so hard drive wise we've
got one two three four five six seven
three and a half inch hard drives we've
got another one hundred and twenty
millimeter fan here in the bottom so in
terms of cooling there's a fair number
of options that are available to you I'm
just going to go ahead and pull this out
so there are two 120 millimeter cooling
fan positions on the front and if you go
ahead and squeeze these together comes
out a lot more easily I suspect Oh
interesting
having a bit of trouble here give me a
sec guys got it guys I just had to heave
on it a little bit so we've got two 120
millimeter cooling fans here in the
front looks like you can also mount 92s
if you so desire so you can use those to
pool your drives here you can see the
inside of the case of the hole so
there's the interface for the front
panel whatnot but I can't really think
of any good reason why you there we go
want to disconnect those so just leave
those attached what else we got here CPU
cutout is right here so it's a fairly
small CPU cutout but as long as your CPU
socket isn't sort of more to the right
then you shouldn't have too much trouble
reaching a backplate CPU cooler and
replacing it without actually removing
the motherboard from the case I guess
there's not too much else to say
bottom-mounted power supply 120mm fan
here to 120s in the front all black
interior which may or may not matter to
you because you can see inside the case
a little bit but it's gonna be less if
you actually mount fans here so there
that should give you guys some idea of
how much you can actually see down into
the case so I do like the all black
interiors but I'm personally more more
inclined to say it's necessary if you do
have a side panel window so thank you
