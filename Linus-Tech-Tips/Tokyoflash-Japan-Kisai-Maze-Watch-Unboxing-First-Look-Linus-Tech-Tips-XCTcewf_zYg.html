the key side maze from Tokyo flash Japan
this is another watch that we're
checking up this is actually the third
one that I've had the opportunity to
experience the shipping container it
came in was one of these and I guess if
you were I guess lots of people probably
order multiple watches because they had
two of them innit like this and they
were packed in sort of really nicely but
yeah they've got a lot of different
unique designs their websites actually
behind me so you connect you can check
them out
tokyo flash japan comm comes with a
little manual that shows you how to use
all the different functionality of the
watch itself so this one is actually
pretty unique in that it has yeah I'm
just gonna take it right out so it's got
a nice soft foam packaging inside it has
a display that is at first glance and
honestly at my second and third glance
but the the claim from what I've heard
so far it becomes more apparent the more
you use it so go ahead and put that
aside for now at first glance is very
difficult to read and once you get more
experience with it becomes easier so
here's the display itself
we'll do a close-up for this don't worry
and you can see that very very difficult
to read now when I press the button
right here it actually reveals exactly
what time it was so here we go so you
can cycle through a variety of different
modes here that show you the time
concealed among amazed that you can
actually have a little animated block
sort of run around inside like a like an
arcade style video game like pac-man or
something on your watch then you press
it to reveal exactly the time if you
don't want to fuss with it press it one
more time to show you the month and the
date and then one more time to thank
it's off mode oh to adjust the alarm
sorry my dad let's take a quick look at
the manual together before we get any
further there's only really two buttons
on the watch so button a has the
functionality of turning on the e-l
backlight this watch unlike the ones
that I've seen in the past does not have
a USB charging port and it
is always illuminated so you can read it
without turning it on to read it so for
example I've got another one behind me
here that you have to turn on to see the
time this one you can read the time on
it at any moment and then in the dark
you just press the button here to
illuminate the display with kind of like
an eerie e-l dreamy black jeans sort of
backlight that looks kind of neat so the
manual gives you all the instructions
how to check the alarm time how to read
the date how to set the time and then on
the other side how to set the date how
to set the alarm and random user
information all just tells you the
battery lasts about a year to maximize
battery life you should limit the use of
the e L backlight because like any watch
that drains the battery a lot faster
than other things it's available in a
variety of colors so there's a blue red
green or Mirror / black background for
the maze itself and then the watch wrist
strap is available the grip strap and
the frame of the watch itself is
available in this brushed black
stainless finish or a brushed silver
finish that that both look actually you
can see on the screen behind me there's
a silver one with a red screen there's a
silver one with a black screen and then
there's a black one with the red screen
the one I have is black with blue so
guys if you want to see how to resize
the watch you can actually check out my
boxing that I already did of the key Sai
rpm so that when I show the whole
procedure it's a bit of a bear but as
long as you've got the right tools handy
even you know just like a paper clip or
whatever else it's really not that hard
you can also get a jeweler to do it
watch on boxing wouldn't be complete
without some shots of the watch on her
wrist I had to remove three links from
this one to get it to fit right which
means this one's a little bit smaller
than the RPM which I had to remove four
links from to get it to be the right
size for my wrist in terms of setting
things up it's actually pretty
straightforward you hold down the top
button in order to set the time so I've
already got it set it's 4:59 right now
you press this button to change the
settings so I'm just gonna go ahead and
set that back to the correct time for a
clock you press it again to change to
minutes press it again to see the
adorable little animation of the little
guy running around the side
the maze the top button also enables the
elimination which isn't that useful
during the day you really can't even
tell the difference but it is intended
for use at night where it works very
effectively thank you for checking out
