Goliath epic showdown a battle royale
between the Maus and the Minotaur a
colossal clash between Cthulhu and a
Care Bear that okay yeah I'm probably
selling this a little bit hard but the
point of today's video is to take a real
underdog competitor the intel pentium g
32:58 and see how well it can compete
with Intel's top-of-the-line core i7 59
60 X if we give it as much help as we
can so stay tuned for that and another
upcoming CPU benchmarking
experimentation video where I'll be
taking that same Extreme Edition chip
that we'll be looking at here and seeing
if I can manipulate it to simulate the
performance of other Intel CPUs in
benchmarks from December 13th to 20th
2014 you can save on select Intel CPU
Schnucks
and SSDs with special holiday rebates
from select retailers click now to learn
more so let's take a moment to meet
today's competitors in the right corner
wearing blue trunks is a core i7 59 60 X
1/8 core monster of a processor that's
plucked at 3 gigahertz nominal and turbo
boost sucked up 3.5 it features hyper
threading for a total of 16 processing
threads
it supports ddr4 memory quad-channel to
boot and is the meanest desktop CPU on
the block but the only real knock
against it being the thousand dollar
price tag and in the left corner wearing
I guess they're also blue trunks is the
Pentium 32:58
anniversary edition now pentium
processors used to be top-of-the-line
but these days until kind of uses the
brand on only their most budget oriented
desktop CPUs with very very low specs I
mean in fact this one only features two
processing cores in an era when four is
the norm no hyper threading for better
handling of multiple tasks per core a
lonely 3.2 gigahertz clock speed and
worst of all it doesn't have the ability
to boost up the frequency of its pores
dynamically with turbo boost
so it's stuck running at 3.2 gigahertz
all the time not much of a sales pitch
right yeah Linus actually this thing
sounds awful why are you even interested
in it well since you asked the G 32:58
is an exceptional piece of hardware for
two reasons one it's only 70 bucks and
has the same underlying architecture as
the rest of Intel's Haswell CPUs
including that Extreme Edition I'll be
it with less cash and to that 3.2
gigahertz is a little misleading when
you can spend literally 30 seconds
overclocking this bad boy to 4.5
gigahertz or more with 1.35 volt I was
rock-solid stable at 4.7 gigahertz so
with single threaded performance it's
theoretically 25% better than what the
59 60 X can achieve that stock speeds
maybe some of our tests gaming anyone
won't look so one-sided after all so
let's get into the tests I ran both
configurations with 16 gigs of ddr3 1866
and ddr4 2400 according to platform
compatibility both of them ran in Asus
GTX 970 strix graphics card for all game
tests and both were cooled by a Corsair
h-60 liquid cooler we'll start with the
gaming results all games were run at
1080p since most gamers are still using
that resolution and frankly I was really
hoping for better from the Pentium
Anniversary Edition even overclocked
thanks to the constantly improving
ability of modern games to leverage the
59 60 X's additional processing course
the Pentiums higher-frequency was only
able to give it the upper hand in Tomb
Raider 2013 but the good news here is
that with the exception of Crysis 3 the
Pentium didn't bottleneck even a
300-plus dollar graphics card to the
point where minimum frame rates fell so
drastically below that magical 60 FPS
mark that it was unpleasant to play so
it's not a win for the G 32:58 in the
conventional sense but considering that
it costs less than one 14th as much and
delivers a passable experience even a
good experience when overclocked I can't
rag on it too hard here non-gaming
results were as expected much worse not
having additional processing cores in
any multi
red workload like the 3d rendering
results in Cinebench and pov-ray and
popular compression utility 7-zip made
this a bloodbath so don't expect the G
32:58 to perform well for tasks like
video editing and remember that the
point of our test was to find out how
close we could get the G 32:58 to the
5960 X's default speed and there's
actually even Headroom on that bad boy
as well so it actually looks even closer
than it is I mean for heavy multitasking
like what we did in this video where I
actually tried to create the most
ridiculous scenario that I could to max
out an 8 core CPU more processing cores
really are needed these days with as
many as possible being a pretty nice
luxury but this conclusion time now I
guess life is rarely as simple as
picking out whichever one seems most
luxurious and going with that and cost
is always a factor you may have noticed
that I stealthily included the core i5
46 70 K on all these graphs from before
that was no accident at 240 bucks for
actually the 4690k which is even
slightly faster the bang for the buck
proposition looks pretty good compared
to the Extreme Edition and while it
doesn't deliver as much value per dollar
in a lighter task as our little you know
David G 32:58
it also won't run into a straight-up
performance wall like the Pentium did in
Crysis 3 where minimum frame rates
dropped to 14 fps making the game an
unplayable stuttery
mess so that's what most people end up
with something more like a core i5 at
the end of their shopping experience but
