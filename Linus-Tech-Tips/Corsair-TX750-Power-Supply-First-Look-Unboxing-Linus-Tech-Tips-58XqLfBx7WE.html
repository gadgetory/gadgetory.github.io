quick look at of course air power supply
it's not particularly new or
particularly exciting from like from a
feature standpoint but what it is is
it's a rock-solid power supply at a good
price I mean okay so yeah like I said
it's not glamorous but that's what
Corsair is known for they're known for
delivering solid power supplies you know
aren't particularly flashy looking or
you know have a bunch of stuff they made
up on the front okay it's a good power
supply at a good price and I've totally
run out of things to say already look at
that
okay so here's the connectors you got a
24-pin connector we've got an 8 pin EPS
connector for PCI Express 6 + 2 pin
connectors 8 SATA 8 molex and 2 floppy
just the right mix for 750 watt power
supply considering what you'd be
plugging into it then on the other side
of the box you've got the general specs
so this is a single 12 volt rail power
supply so that's a 60 amp 12 volt rail a
lot of people like to see that and it's
a no-nonsense sort of approach in terms
of noise level you can see that the
decibels are rated on a curve you can
check out these graphs on Corsair calm
as well here's your efficiency graph so
this is not a t + certified as far as
the box is concerned I had thought it
was it has a five-year warranty from
Corsair and let's get to what's inside
the box so first you got your user's
manual okay so that includes some
general information about the unit
itself and then you've got your packing
foam it comes in a nice little velvety
bag that's kind of a nice touch okay
we'll get to the power supply unit
itself in just a moment here though
you've got just a standard three prong
power connector you've got some cable
ties for organizing your cables because
this is a non modular unit then you have
a powered by corsair sticker and four
black screws to attach the power supply
to your case now let's get this velvet
bag open and then inside there you'll
find a plastic bag and inside the
plastic bag you will find the TX
750 watt power supply so it has a 100
35-millimeter cooling fan and you can
kind of see the guts of the unit itself
in there on each side it has TX 750 watt
and kind of orange e orange e colored
logo then on the top you're gonna find
your general specs again which are also
on the side of the box and at the back
you see just your on/off switch power
plug and then a honeycomb grille now the
connectors themselves
one thing that Corsair does again it's
part of their you know sort of
no-nonsense approaches they've always
got reasonably long cables attached to
their power supply so every one of these
cables is gonna be nice and long so that
means you could potentially use it in an
800 d case which I'm sitting next to a a
skid of okay so the connectors as I
outlined before we have where all my PCI
Express we've got four six plus two pin
PCI Express we've got an eight pin EPS
bunch of molex buncha SATA and the
cameraman telling me we're running out
of time thank you for checking on my
unboxing and overview of the TX and 750
watt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
