claims to be the simple way to connect
your PC to a wireless network however I
haven't really had a chance to put it to
the test yet so I've got a couple of
valais series products here first of all
I have the valley valet valet however
you pronounce it I'm gonna say valet or
valet I don't know I've got the valet
router right here so this is a wireless
n router it's got four ten hundred
Ethernet ports and then it supports
wireless n obviously that would be
without wires okay so here's the back of
the router that's basically what it
looks like and then I have the little
USB key that comes with the valet so I'm
gonna do two different scenarios first I
am going to connect the valet to a
computer running a third-party wireless
card okay and then I'm going to use a
Linksys valet connector so this is their
own valet branded USB Wi-Fi card and I'm
going to see how much different the
process is if at all versus connecting
to a third-party one this is the
networking corner so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to unplug my DGL 4500 plug
in the Cisco valet and then we'll go
from there okay
the indicator lights we've got on here
seem to be indicating Wireless is
working our internet connection is
active and I have one LAN port plugged
in so that is the one that goes to as
per the label of the side bedroom so
that's where I'm on my way back to okay
that didn't take nearly five minutes but
it did take about three some
congratulations you are now connected to
the Internet
remove your easy setup key and keep it
in a safe place you will use it to
connect other computers so the easy
setup key is basically just like WPS
button as far as I can tell because it
did manage to connect me to the network
but I don't think it really did anything
advanced like along the lines of what in
the heck okay hold on maybe did some
more advanced things it changed the name
of links as 3/6 whatever whatever to
shiny cheetah
and also created a guest login as well
that's kind of neat so they've generated
some kind of okay well hold on this up
up the network she checks it so it's set
it as a work network which is
interesting rather than as a home
network and it's named to noon okay so
let's let's take a little deeper let's
find out what exactly the easy setup
wizard has done for us here so connected
on the computer or another device to
your valet so you can add devices say
for example another computer in your
house okay so basically this is just a
wizard to walk you through walking down
there and connecting the easy setup key
okay
here we've got wireless printer what if
I wanted to do this refer to the
printers documentation okay so these are
just little wizards let's say Oh Apple
iPhone smartphone what if I were to do
that I have an Apple iPhone smartphone
here right in front of me okay so what
would I want to do okay so the here's
the security key and the security type
that it gives me and I can print these
settings and then I can connect my smart
phone I'm not gonna bother doing that I
know that'll work
okay back back what else do we got we
got guest access so allow guest access
yes or no so I could turn that off I can
send how many guests so I could say only
one guest is allowed I can change the
password it looks like the password by
default is Kiwi 52 which is not bad they
should connect to the wireless guest
network listed above open a browser and
then enter the guest password Nido well
that's a cool option so you can set it
up so that they have to enter password
besides just hack suring into your your
shiny cheetah guest wireless account
neat okay so I can finish that I'll go
back actually I really like this the
Cisco Connect software is looking pretty
good to me right about now because this
is the kind of this is the kind of
layout that like my aunt can use and
that is really my benchmark for anything
that is supposed to be simple is if my
aunt can do it then it's probably simple
don't tell her I said that but what else
do we got here so valet settings so
I mean telling her open up a browser and
type in 192.168.1.1 then go to the
advance and then there's no way there's
no way she'll be able to handle that so
this is the kind of thing that she can
actually handle so safe web surfing or
see if you're about to visit a
potentially harmful web site
here's your valley name and password
updater create an easy set up key okay
looks like you don't have to use the one
that's included
here's advance setting so do we got so
this is for expert use only so stay away
this is exactly the kind of thing I
would be pretty happy for it to tell my
aunt before she goes in and messes up
things so if men I copied the password
AHA so now we're going to 192.168.1.1 I
don't have a password on it now or
apparently I don't I don't know that's
all because it gave me a password to use
okay so this takes me to how to actually
set up sorry about that my memory card
filled up so this is where you can
actually control the router the way that
more advanced people would be able to do
it okay so we'll close that close that
alright so then we'll okay we're
finished in here and let last but not
least let's have a look at the parental
controls so parental controls password
let's make it
whoops let's make it muffin in five okay
all right and the secret question will
be do you know muffin man and the answer
would be yes okay
so we've set that up let's have a look
at what parental controls does for us
okay restrict access on test PC block
internet access here you got x block
sites inappropriate for block specific
sites neato and then finished so thank
you for checking out my my one way of
doing things actually no you know what
let's let's do it with the valley
connector now and see if it's any
different all right so when we installed
the cisco valet USB Wi-Fi thing so there
it is okay we got a similar wizard okay
no not that not that this and we get a
setup guide so why don't we try that set
up and please wait this may take up to
five minutes okay well i'll be back then
well after a couple seconds it prompts
me to tell it whether i have an easy set
up key which i do but let's pretend for
the sake of making things more difficult
for ourselves that i do not after a
couple more seconds it comes up with a
list of which wireless access points
there are around me which I can select
one and then I can enter the password
for shiny cheetah okay well I don't
remember what the setup for what the
password is and other than putting in
the easy setup key I don't really know
of any way that I can figure it out at
this point but it looks like here
basically this is my conclusion on the
valet the router is the big one so if
you get the valley connector obviously
you are assured that it'll be compatible
with the router which can be a bit of a
problem for wireless devices but the
router and the easy setup key seems to
be where the magic happens so I would
definitely recommend based on what I've
seen so far from the Cisco valley router
getting this for your less well
technologically inclined relatives or
friends and it looks like it should be
quite a simple way for them to set up
not only just connecting to the internet
but also managing some basic
configuration stuff like parental
controls and guest networks and stuff
like that thanks for checking out this
