users were confronted with a dilemma
Microsoft had in many enthusiasts eyes
been making blunder after blunder in
their efforts to turn what we all
thought was a perfectly functional
operating system into some kind of idiot
friendly touchscreen fisher-price
looking nonsense and on top of trying to
fix what ain't broke Microsoft wanted
unprecedented access to their users data
and resolved to just force system
updates when you're right in the middle
of something
and all for what DirectX 12 so many
power users ended up sticking with
Windows 7 and are still using it today
but they have a problem if you're one of
these individuals you now have less than
one year before Microsoft cuts off
Windows 7 you may not want to risk an
upgrade but as Aragorn said to fit in in
the Great Hall of EDS upgrading is upon
you whether you would risk it or not
wait I don't think that's quite what he
said you know what else is close I can
almost smell it so close that's our
sponsor it won't help you with your
Windows 7 problem but they still G
skills Trident II royal series ddr4
memory features a polished aluminium
heat spreader that's available in both
gold or silver and a crystalline light
bar that radiates beautiful RGB check it
out at the link below
now you might not realize this but in
spite of Microsoft practically giving
away Windows 10 even to those with
pirated installations most users stuck
with Windows 7
rather than upgrading either to eight or
ten something that only finally changed
late last year in December net market
share reported that Windows 10
installations rose above Windows 7 for
the first time and now account for
nearly 41 percent of the user base
compared to Windows 7 37 percent now
hopefully that number is going to
continue to go down as we get closer to
January 14 2020 the day that Windows 7
dies because otherwise we are gonna have
some serious problems because yes yes ok
Windows 7 it's not gonna die it's not
like you just turn on your computer and
it doesn't turn on anymore
it's just going to stop receiving
feature updates bug fixes and most
importantly security updates which are
very important if you want to I don't
know continue Oh safe using the Internet
now as it did for previous versions of
Windows Microsoft is offering extended
security updates or yes you ECU for
Windows 7 enterprise and pro additions
up until January 2023 but this extended
the update service won't come cheap and
adding insult to injury the price will
double each year so three years of
support is gonna cost a hundred and
seventy-five bucks for enterprise
licenses and three hundred and fifty for
windows 7 pro og also if you're a mega
ball or PC gamer thinking yeah no
problem 350 bucks looks like what mid
tier graphics card
sorry I've got some bad news for you too
ESU is only available for volume license
subscriptions which are usually held by
companies or schools so business is
running Windows 7 machines on
Microsoft's Azure cloud as part of the
Windows virtual desktop program those
folks get ESU for free
but again baller gamers I would imagine
that scenario doesn't apply to you so
then if you're just a regular Windows 7
user with a personal license what can
you do well before we get too deep into
your options let's take a look at why
people want to hold on to Windows 7 like
that grudge against their brother for
stealing the last piece of their
birthday cake even though they told them
that they were saving it for later and
hid it away way in the back of the
fridge so you wouldn't know it was there
Windows 7 was is kind of fantastic it's
mature stable and reliable and offers a
great amount of control over the way it
behaves its interface is functional
familiar and extremely customizable and
it's got all your settings just the way
that you like them
I mean furthermore I wouldn't be
surprised if anyone upgrading now has a
program or two that would either require
a new not to mention costly license to
run on Windows 10 or that isn't
available for it at all and there's
other little creature comforts typing in
the search bar retrieves results that
make sense instead of a Windows setting
you weren't looking for or a web result
from big windows 7 doesn't incessantly
ask you to send more of your personal
information to Microsoft or decide on
its own when it's time to update whether
you like it or not
updates are available sorry you know
what I'm actually kind of in the middle
of something kind of Roger that updating
now but as awesome as Windows 7 is there
are quite a few cons to staying with it
past the end date for extended support
besides lacking the latest antivirus
protections Windows 7 won't have Windows
10 features like device guard UEFI
secure boot and Windows hello which
offer higher overall security for your
system and while gaming performance is
about the same some things like system
boot times are slower in Windows 7
compared to Windows 10 so it turns out
Microsoft software engineers weren't
sitting around playing beer pong for the
last 78 years also if you're worried
about future proofing at all which you
should be at least a little bit Windows
7 is not a great bet as software and
even hardware makers eventually do stop
providing support for legacy operating
systems so even if you pay for es you
support only lasts for three years and
costs more than a Windows 10 license and
you might be able to upgrade for free
anyway yep
even though Microsoft officially ended
their offer for a free upgrade to
Windows 10 from Windows 7 or 8 many
users have reported successful fully
activated upgrades by using Microsoft's
official upgrade utility and even if you
have to pay bare with me for a moment
here
Windows 10 might not be as bad as you
think there are a lot of happy users out
there who appreciate its combination of
the efficiency and customization of
Windows 7 and the modern design of
Windows 8 and despite Microsoft's best
efforts there is actually a fair bit
that you can do to minimize their data
collection and postpone system updates
until absolutely necessary or at least
until it's convenient so we're gonna
have some resources for you guys for
this linked in the video description but
let's say you drop a line at Windows 10
fine you say I'll stop using Windows 7
but hashtag never Windows 10 whoo
tell you guys are serious cuz that
hashtag there well for you guys there
are other options first up there's
Windows 8.1
I mean I doubt that you guys have stuck
with Windows 7 for this long just to get
into the OS that Gabe Newell called a
catastrophe and it's data collection and
update system are kind of similar to
Windows 10 but at least it'll be getting
security updates though realistically
now that Microsoft has learned from
their mistake of supporting Windows XP
for like ever
that'll probably only buy you a couple
of years so maybe that's not a great
option so then what how about Oh Mac OS
while Apple's desktop OS has come a long
way and is obviously used by many tech
enthusiasts the thing is I don't see
many windows 7 diehards willingly
affecting to apples Camp Plus you would
need to either buy a totally new
computer or begin the long arduous
process of trying to turn your existing
PC into a hackintosh now it might be
doable but even most hackintosh
enthusiasts are pretty open about what a
finicky experience that is leaving Linux
now a couple of years ago I would have
said that that's madness
but Linux is a more viable option than
ever before even for gamers now we're
planning another follow-up video on
Valve's proton compatibility software
but for now the main thing you need to
know about it is that it makes an ever
growing list of Windows games run
flawlessly on Linux and community
reports indicate that thousands more run
pretty well as for the non-gamers
popular Linux distros like Ubuntu work
great for productivity focused views
especially if the majority of your work
is done on the web and there are even
distros that borrow heavily from Windows
for their interface like Linux Mint so
your homesickness will at least be saved
a little and then of course there's the
last option stick with Windows 7
hold fast as your destruction edges ever
closer so you goodbye
to hardware or software upgrades and
just well just don't browse the internet
after January 14th 2012 with regards to
that option I mean you know what
Godspeed you brave bastard but needless
to say we don't actually recommend doing
that what we do recommend though if you
need to build a beautiful website
without the hassle is Squarespace with
Squarespace is all in one platform you
just pick a template and turn your text
throw in your pictures design a logo
they've got all kinds of amazing tools
and boom you have a website it might not
be a very good website it might not have
a lot of important information on it but
that's on you sir or ma'am it's not on
Squarespace because they have tons of
amazing help that you can leverage they
offer webinars full series of help
guides and you can contact their 24/7
