video that I've actually been excited to
make for quite some time it must have
been at least like three months ago or
something like this that that we came
across let's see if I can find it here
yeah there it is we came across this the
can you get over here right yeah cool
are you good the PC water cooling rate
240 millimeter cooler pump reservoir CPU
block rigid Pipes d.i.y so this is a sub
$80.00 full custom water cooling kit
from one of those like Chinese retailers
in this case banggood.com now in the
time since I excitedly ordered this
thing we have actually explored whether
all-in-one liquid coolers are actually a
better option than air coolers and what
we found was that compared to a very
high quality air cooler like one from
say Noctua and AIO liquid cooler in
every case that we measured actually was
more expensive while not providing the
same level of performance actually a
lesser amount of performance however one
of the things that we acknowledged in
that video was that full custom water
cooling loops were a little bit
different so the goal today is to find
out whether a cheap full custom water
cooling loop is still worth the extra
effort even if it actually doesn't cost
any more than a high quality air cooler
or a cheap AIO
so it comes packed a little something
like this and we're gonna we're gonna
get to our unboxing of the banggood PC
water cooling rate 240 okay I'm not
going to do that again we're gonna get
to that in a moment but first this were
from our sponsor private Internet access
features fast multi gigabit VPN tunnel
gateways worldwide if you're looking for
a VPN learn more at what's the offer
code LNG dot G G slash p IA linus one
also there's another thing we have to do
hop hop on over here you guys you know
Jake if we were really smart we would
have taken a mirrored output from this
bench and then you could have switched
to a screen capture that would have been
quite smart indeed but we didn't do that
so Brendan just gets to film it so we're
keeping this really simple basically
this has only been sitting on here for
man maybe five minutes or something like
that so our CPU temp so we're just gonna
sit about the thirty degrees range
that's that's what we'd expected idle so
we're gonna go ahead and we're going to
run our test stress test for five
minutes now okay if we were doing this
as a pre-recorded video we would run
this stress test for probably closer to
about twenty minutes because the thing
about liquid coolers is that because
water can absorb so much thermal energy
before its temperature actually raises
what you're supposed to do is you're
supposed to wait until it reaches what's
called an equilibrium point where the
amount of thermal energy that it's
absorbing is equal to the amount that's
being dissipated by the fans on the
radiator so the way that you would
typically do that is you'd wait for the
water to warm up such that the
difference between the temperature of
the water and the temperature of the
surrounding air is so great that the
thermal transfer from the fans is more
efficient and it matches the thermal
transfer of the CPU block into the water
loop that's how we would want to do it
unfortunately we're doing this live you
know we can probably get away with like
a ten minute test let's do a ten minute
test we're doing this live so what we're
kind of stuck with here is a timed time
to challenge so our idle temperatures
were thirty we're gonna run this for ten
minutes
and we're gonna see where we end up on
our CPU just so you guys know we are
presenting both of these coolers with
kind of a worst-case scenario here so
this is a core I 917
Exe now I didn't do any overclocking or
anything like that but wait a minute is
this only getting why is this only
getting 83% utilization
what the devil is going on here that's
weird
does the FPU what you know that
shouldn't normally hit a hundred percent
ah 120 watts only ya know this this
really does not sound right oh man
okay ho ho boy now we get to do some
live live troubleshooting and stuff oh
man I didn't bother to plug this into
network because I didn't think I was
gonna need it I've had all the utilities
that I wanted I'm just gonna I don't
even know if I have network card drivers
on here because this is just like a
Rando bench that I grabbed and through a
boot drive on oh man oh man yeah we
simply will not be able to make do with
eighty-five percent utilization there
that's not that's not good enough okay
so in the meantime we need to kill this
test so that it can get back down to
about 30 degrees which actually
shouldn't take it that long and then
dang it okay there's some good news at
least one of my onboard network
controllers does have a driver installed
so we just need to wait for that to pick
up and then we can grab another stress
test oh yeah I want to allow that cool
okay so at least I'm not gonna be using
sneakernet to grab Network drivers off
of my my work computer there alright um
yo Anthony I de for some reason was only
giving me 85% CPU usage the other
suggested alternative I was gonna grab
prime95
okay yeah sure I know prime95 is not
cool anymore but like whatever no
settings I just said it to some to
stress F to you nothing else I know no I
don't really get it
what's that no I have not tried turning
it off and turning it back on
thank you Jake I don't have the turbo
boost max technology driver installed
but that shouldn't really matter no I'm
not gonna stress about it we're just
gonna grab the windows 64-bit thing here
maybe I should do some super chats in
the meantime all right where's my laptop
no here it is alright that download come
on baby don't have a lot of time to wait
here people are waiting I don't know how
many people are waiting because I don't
have the chat open because I am super
prepared for my stream like that but I'm
sure at least three people are watching
right now at least I know it's more than
that Jake a couple thousand all right
all right you know what you're adding
pressure right now
you're not actually making this easier
no I have not tried turning it off and
turning it back on yet is that is that a
super chat or something like is that why
your thank you Jake thank you for your
input I appreciate it
no I have not started I have not tried
relaunching the software okay tell you
what
I will reboot I can't even download this
file I'm just clicking this link and
it's just not downloading come on Oh
technology you're so awesome
meanwhile my Chrome browser window here
is just black it's not responding sorry
excuse me
lordy come on let's go
I swear it's like sometimes I feel magic
like magic like you know my family will
call me it would be like well it's not
working and I'll sit down I'll like
touch it and it just like works
perfectly and I'm like okay like magic
fingers and then like the other 90% of
the time I feel like something's working
perfectly and all I have to do is walk
into the same room as it and it breaks
the new creator studio for a YouTube if
anyone was wondering it's abominable it
doesn't even have a live streaming tab
in it yet and they're telling us that
what is this BIOS is updating LED
firmware that is a that is a low
priority right now very low priority
what was I even talking about right
right right yeah they told us at the
creator summit that they are rolling the
new creator studio out to everyone this
year and I'm kind of looking at it going
you guys have already had this in beta
for about eight months and based on the
progress you've made so far another
eight months so I'm really worried
because there's a ton of functions that
just do not work all right check
Colton's Twitter the business team has a
machete yes I I am actually aware of
Colton's machete he walked up behind me
when I was in the bathroom doing my hair
I do do my hair just cuz I don't do a
good job doesn't mean I don't try and
he's like holding this thing behind me
he's like hey check out what John Doe
got me and I'm like I can't quite see
cuz I have my arms up like this and he's
right behind me I'm like machete like
yeah why you have a machete at work I
thought maybe it was my day it wasn't it
was all good
and now we are not getting an internet
connection why why do you hate me why do
you hate me
why are no Wi-Fi networks found I know
there are Wi-Fi networks I will disable
the network connection and I will
re-enable it yes I am familiar with that
particular troubleshooting step Jakob
Andrew says ready for the not live
conspiracy theories yeah me too they're
hilarious trust me guys if we were pre
recording this this is not how it would
go down okay so there's good news my
prime95 download is working so we're
just gonna pop into our downloads folder
hope that there's nothing incriminating
in there and extract this bad boy to a
desktop folder and then hopefully we're
gonna see a hundred percent CPU usage
now and also hopefully where's this
folder I just created there it is
hopefully we're also going to be back
down to about 30 degrees so that we know
we're at sort of a good baseline
starting point temperature because if we
don't start at our idle temperature then
our load temperature won't necessarily
be representative all right let's open
this puppy up
I just stress testing it's all good
thirty-six torture test threads smallest
FFT why don't we just do small FFT let's
do that we're a die to go come on baby
no no
and computer sensors all right cool
so our CPU is at Oh balls
wait what CPU is at forty degrees well
that's weird
doing something in the background now
that seems a little hot I mean I guess
it is an eighteen court oh great
it's we're looking at about 8% twelve
ten percent utilization in the
background what is even what are even
happening right now
SVC host yeah okay so this was why I
didn't really want to plug in the
internet because I think it's just doing
Windows modules installer junk Microsoft
content updates that kind of thing in
the background I really wish there was
just like a clean okay
well all we can do now is go forward so
we're gonna start our small FFT test and
then we're just gonna have to wait we're
gonna have to wait for it to reach our
saturation point so here we go Wow
I don't think I've ever watched prime95
lunch that many workers before I haven't
used it in a long time
alright you have got to be kidding me
why is it at 85% utilization okay I
rebooted it Jake it shouldn't be set to
low power mode and that shouldn't affect
it yeah I will check but I sincerely
doubt it additional power settings here
we go no we're on balanced yeah I don't
know that there is a high performance on
desktop it's certainly not that oh there
we go
okay whatever balance should be fine it
shouldn't matter processor power
management
okay assistant maximum processor state
is a hundred percent why no no it's set
two hundred percent already it's fine
you don't have to do that
no I didn't unbalance it's set to a
hundred percent just it's fine
there's nothing there's nothing wrong
with that okay well alright I guess we
just don't really have much of a choice
here I don't know I don't know what it's
doing two different stress tests are
like yep eighty-seven percent that's all
you get the good news is that CPU
package power consumption is actually
pretty consistent at around 140 to 145
hundred and fifty watts so as long as
it's running the same it doesn't really
matter so I guess we are just gonna roll
with it let's go ahead and unbox our
banggood.com water cooling kit this is
the kind of thing that you just cannot
predict will go wrong do you want me to
lower this at Oh Brandon or is it all
good don't lower it Oh should I put it
back I will put it back alright cool so
I actually don't know what's in these
unmarked boxes I can take some guesses
this is probably a reservoir that's
weird it looks like it comes with three
fans even though it's a dual radiator
why don't we start with that start with
the most obvious thing so any water
cooling kits all in one or or custom is
going to come with some a few
fundamental parts one is our radiator so
this is what allows you to take the
thermal energy that it's absorbed by the
water from your CPU and dissipate it to
the surrounding air because that's right
folks at the end of the day
fundamentally everything is air cooling
unless it's phase change cooling in
which case eventually it's air cooling
now something I'm
sort of curious about is what materials
this radiator is made of so you can see
we've got a pretty dense thin
arrangement here so this will probably
perform its best with sort of more
pressure optimized fans like higher
speed fans and there's a couple other
noteworthy things about this design so
one is that unlike a lot of higher-end
radiators these days one of the fluid
tubes is actually right under these
these fan screw holes so this was a bit
of a design flaw of older radiators and
it was quite common for people to
accidentally screw their fans in too
tight and puncture the tubes with that
said what they've done to combat that is
they put a really large gap in here so
it would actually be kind of hard to
bung that up so I'm not going to take
off a ton of marks here what I would
take a ton of marks off for is if this
thing is not made of brass brass or
copper and you're just gonna resort to
just using a flashlight to look in here
and oh that's rough ya know so you guys
aren't gonna get a great look at this I
don't think can you get right down the
barrel of that thing probably not
Brandon right can you see it without my
phone getting in the way right can you
pull it off the point is there's no
there's no copper colour in there
there's no brass colour this is clearly
an aluminum radiator I was pretty sure
just picking it up like it's super crazy
light but yeah so at the very least what
I would recommend if you have an
aluminum radiator and if we have any
copper components in here is using some
kind of anti corrosive additive and I
shouldn't have really used the word
recommend because I don't recommend that
that's a bad idea
mixing metals is a super super rotten
time and you shouldn't do it sorry
alright so there you go there's our
radiator mounting hardware
next up oh wow so I guess I'm making an
assumption here that these are actually
real but if they are then hey it ships
with deep cool fans
and wow these actually might even be LED
fans so this thing should look pretty
cool if nothing else I was expecting
like no name yet loon fans or something
like that but no this seems to be
surprisingly decent really quiet I'm
actually not sure though if that
particular header on the motherboard is
being speed controlled right now and I
have no molex harnesses plugged into
this motherboard right now so I can't I
can't double check that but I was
allowing Corsair to use their own
management we were just gonna kind of
see how loud it gets for better or for
worse anyway so there you go it'll be an
apples to apples comparison or it'll be
a comparison anyway alright let's see
what's in our next box actually let's do
this one first cuz yeah I'm pretty sure
it's another one there you go this one's
the same box as the fans but seems to
have something else inside oh okay so
this seems to be kind of an oddball size
of tubing it doesn't look like quarter
inch tubing it looks a little bit bigger
but it's certainly not 3/8 I think I
borrowed a tape measure from James the
other day hey James ah hey James stride
hey Alex can you throw something at
James cool thank you
you know I thought you were gonna
actually throw it that's gonna be like
well Brandon at least make sure you
catch this up can I borrow your tape
measure you don't have it anymore oh he
put it away alright yeah I actually
don't care that much anyway so we got
about 6 feet of tubing that should be
enough for our purposes today
here's where things I think are gonna
get really interesting here is our block
so we've actually had some pretty good
experiences with just like cheap blocks
off these Chinese marketplace sites
before oh whoa sorry just to finish that
thought so I'm expecting that these
might actually perform reasonably
decently one concern that I had
immediately is that they are copper
blocks so while it's a lot better to
have the copper be you know downstream
of the aluminum radiator than what Swift
tech did with the Apogee GTX way back in
the day where they had a copper base
with an aluminum block like right
physically attached to it this is still
not a recommended configuration so yeah
what's interesting here though is that
they've got a CPU block so that's where
you got your your fittings sticking at
the top like this but they've also
included a GPU block so these used to be
all the rage back I don't know 10 12
years ago before full cover blocks got I
wouldn't say more affordable because
they didn't people just started
accepting that if you wanted to water
cool your graphics card you needed a
full cover block because because video
cards got so many other components on
them over that sort of few years in
there that needed cooling aside from the
GPU that by the time you bottle actually
this is great I have examples of them so
by the time you bought a whole whack of
Swift tech mc4 teens like little heat
sinks or to cover your ram modules or MC
21s so these are little heat sinks to to
cool your VRMs by the time you did all
of this and then you still needed to
point a fan at it you were spending a
bunch of additional money and you
weren't getting one of the key benefits
of water cooling which is quiet you're
trying to eliminate fans not not add
them so people kind of abandon these you
still can you
them but just note that you'd probably
want to get like a little bracket or
something to point a fan like a pretty
strong one probably not something as as
quiet as this directly your GPU to make
sure that you're getting out of cook
cooling and I'd also recommend some
little heat sinks so we're not going to
install this today also partly because
it wouldn't then be an apples-to-apples
comparison against our a IO which does
not have a GPU in the loop so in terms
of the construction here it's pretty
pretty straightforward you've got a
standard sort of thickness copper base
comes with a pre applied protective
cover it's hard to evaluate flatness
like this I would go ahead and say that
it's not incredibly flat though so if
you can see any distortion in the
reflection of something off of it that's
where you'll you'll see if it has any
kind of bowing to it with that said
again about ten years ago it became
standard practice to slightly bow out
the center of the block so once you
tighten it down it actually flattens
onto a flat IHS but I really I doubt
they've put that much consideration into
this pen again maybe I'm just not giving
them enough credit mounting hardware
wise here's some thermal compound we're
not gonna use this we're good
wait what oh okay no there is some in
there is this a paper package for it
though wow I've never seen that before
oh we're not gonna use that we're gonna
use the same thermal pad that we're
using for the other cooler just for for
the sake of fairness I would say though
that that's going to be an advantage for
the Corsair cooler because I sincerely
doubt that this stuff performs as well
as the probably Tier one thermal paste
that of course there would be using pre
applied to their coolers alright so
there's our cpu block and mount this is
a very rudimentary mounting system this
might take me a little while what else
we got here this way is a fair bit this
has got to be the pump
and it is this is another thing that I
would consider to be a likely advantage
for the Corsairs of the world this pump
is is is off-brand
even for a Chinese pump like it doesn't
have like you know chang hong
electronics on here
I think Chang Hong actually makes TVs
but don't worry about that minor details
like it has no markings on it whatsoever
just a molex lead with some basics
leaving on it sticking out of the back
and then they've gone ahead and they've
put a plexi top on it so it looks like
whoever's making this kit is just
sourcing these like these pumps and then
they've they've gone ahead like I wonder
if it's the same it'd be hard to tell
just looking at the acrylic yeah you
wouldn't really be able to tell anything
from that but I'd have no reason to
believe that this is made in a different
place either so they've both got the
same kind of markings around the outside
here kind of like streaky hard to say
very hard to say all right last part
hopefully this is as fun for you guys as
it is for me I'm actually having a blast
right now so this as I predicted is our
reservoir so for those just tuning in
what's remarkable about this kit is that
it's just $80 so that's actually cheaper
then the dual 120 millimeter AIO liquid
cooler that i have back here and price
competitive with something like a
high-end air cooler from Noctua except
that it is for better or for worse fully
custom water cooling now this is where a
surprising amount of the cost of water
cooling actually is in the fittings and
as fittings go as fittings go these are
actually like pretty nice so they're g1
quarter standard standard threading
they've got recessed o-rings so you
can't accidentally over tighten them
they've got there they've got a hex
portion to them here so you can tighten
them with a ring
if you want and they are nickel coated
or nickel-plated both on the outside and
the inside like this is actually these
are these are decent fittings I was half
expecting them to be made of aluminum
because the radiator was made of
aluminum but uh but they're not also
curious is that they appear to have
included more of them than we actually
need oh right because I'm not installing
the GPU so no I don't believe I do
actually have extras now this I don't
really get so that's a plug for our
reservoir right there and then this one
right here I have yet to determine the
purpose of also included these have kind
of gone out of fashion but they are
effective
I forget what these are called but these
are an older style of tubing clamp right
there what are these called again
can't remember primo chill did some of
really nice ones way back in the day
that was before they did those
disastrous plastic fittings oh the last
thing included in the kit TBT funnel
look at that
that's a Linus hand for scale come on be
kidding me all right so this is where my
plug goes actually oh I hadn't really
talked about the reservoir so this is
probably I would say the most standout a
well constructed piece of this entire
kit this is crystal-clear spring clamp
thank you
it's crystal clear these are nice like
feel like really nice rubber o-rings
compared to the ones on the fittings
that are kind of ear more your more
basic they're not as they're not as
squishy not as malleable like these are
really nice it threads in and out like
just really well the machine markings
are really minor compared to the rest of
the stuff like this is this is actually
a perfectly nice rate reservoir the one
deficiency in its construction here is
that it doesn't have like a proper
baffled
prevent air from being recirculated in
the loop but that said it's tall enough
that it shouldn't be a huge issue and it
does at least have this little piece of
tubing right here that will bring the
bubbles up away from the from the outlet
here so we'll we'll do our best with it
it should be okay but it is not ideal so
I'm gonna start fitting things up this
really is the main drawback of custom
water cooling especially once you get
the price the same that it's more work
to build it up so Oh are we ready
actually come on over here Brendan are
we ready to get our results from our i/o
yet this has been running for oh shoot
it doesn't tell me how long it's been
running for because oh man
okay how am I gonna figure this out what
do these lines denote are they like 15
second lines
we'll find out okay they're like seven
second lines oh crap
actually know what we're getting pretty
close yeah we have mostly reached
equilibrium here anyway so you can
really see this we're clearly
approaching an asymptote so if we were
to say 53 54 degrees I don't think
anyone's going to begrudge us that
anyway we've got a little bit more time
because I've got some boat set that's 17
minutes and I've been talking for that
long holy smokes I just talk and talk
and talk don't I Luke was right I was
one of his mean things that he said
about me in the roast is that I just
never shut up I was like well alright
fair enough
ah I think Oh Oh what okay I'm having a
hard time figuring out what their plan
was for the fittings here so this needs
to go here ooh that does not thread in
nicely let's try a different one see if
that's any better they do they did not
do a great job of tapping these threads
and I would know a not great job of
tapping threads I'm something of an
expert uh
oh shoot yeah you can actually see
there's a real screw up there well I was
saving this for for later to talk about
our sponsor for today's video
the iFixit essential electronics toolkit
but I actually need it right now
pop this open I can use this one of
their pokey tools so I'm gonna see if I
can kind of get that excess junk out of
there with a spudger and if that clears
it up a bit so you can see that now
right can you see the extra bit there I
need to do this upside down so that if
it falls it falls out all right
let's see if cleaning up that thread
helped No
let's try the other one no these are
just hey Jake can I ask a favor can you
grab a wrench yeah I think I'm gonna
need to wrench this in aa pliers pliers
would not be ideal now I would really
like a wrench just one of the adjustable
ones is fine so you can see here my
o-ring is making contact but just barely
so this is already a reason that I would
suggest for most people if you're going
to do a custom loop going with high
quality components from known
manufacturers like your swift tags and
ek s and alpha cools of the world
because you are far less likely to find
a random issue like this where it just
frankly wasn't Q seed like I am NOT only
running up against kind of rough
threading here I feel like I'm bottoming
out which don't tune out now but could
be a showstopper for us just crank it
but then we might crack the plexi on the
top so in the meantime while we wait for
Jake we can go ahead and mount our fans
to our radiator here so I'm gonna go
with exactly the same configuration that
I did for the Corsair rad thank you Jack
ooh
I appreciate that wrench all right let's
do our best here I will be gentle I'm
always gentle Jake I'm like a gentle
giant except I'm not a giant so that
should tell you how gentle I am going
with that oh man these are yeah like I'm
clearly bottoming out but I did manage
to get about another third of a turn out
of them and it seems like I've got okay
contact there should we bring in our our
engineering consultant hey Alex come
give me your expert opinion over here
here do you think this is gonna leak no
what do you mean nope no no the fittings
like yeah like around the o-rings do
those look sufficiently mush to you
here's a not installed one for context
should we have the shot to hell handy
when we're testing all right thank you
yeah I guess if that's if that's the
goal then I guess mission accomplished
um well I don't think that's really the
problem I think it's actually the
machining that they did for this this
like expansion thing here we might
actually even be right up against the
copper fence how thick is no okay that's
weird we're up against something I
couldn't yeah we could run it out
through there I couldn't wait oh yeah
don't worry don't worry about it all
right carry carry on whatever you were
doing so something important just tell
me it's important it's okay okay he was
trying to who's trying to think of
whether it was under embargo or not a
lot of the stuff we do like we we feel
like oh yeah we should do like a tweet
about this and then we look at it more
like oh yeah no we're not allowed to
talk about that until the NDA is up it's
frustrating because we'd love to just
tell you guys about stuff as soon as it
comes across our desks but it's just not
always that simple because you break
enough embargoes and companies stop
sending you stuff now to be clear no one
we work with has like consequences for a
negative review or anything like that
it's just that an embargo has a clear
and appreciable and demonstrably damage
that it does to a company if you break
it because like it might give their
competitors insight into their
product launch that they can then use to
counteract it so like you know someone
could make the argument that us breaking
the embargo on pricing for something you
know cost them hundreds of thousands of
dollars and sales or something like that
so you gotta be really careful around
that type of stuff all right so there's
a radiator and I think we're actually
pretty much ready right here check this
out we've settled in so our room
temperature right now is 23 degrees
Celsius I know because I set it to that
right before we started and we've
settled in at 52 degrees running at 2.25
gigahertz this seems to be like a power
throttling thing of some sort I think
that's what's going on I think there
must be some kind of bio setting or
something anyway if we change nothing
then at least we have a fixed load and
we ended up with 53 degrees Celsius so
we can go ahead and shut down our system
and we can start installing our weirdo
banggood.com one so this I still don't
really understand if I was to use this
on the pump and then maybe hook it
straight into the reservoir like maybe
that was the idea behind it but then the
funny thing about that is now if you
look at this so I've got all my fittings
installed Here I am now one fitting
short if I actually did want to use the
GPU or if I didn't use this weird
connector one then I am too fitting
short and I just didn't get fittings for
my GPU so I think they might have bugged
this up in more ways than one anyway
these threaded in just fine so this is
all good let's go ahead and tighten
these on just in case what I say for at
43 degrees right
take 43 degrees right for the temps
53 thank you thank you now 44 you didn't
seem right
alright let's head over to the other
side of the table here and let's get
this thing installed why is this thing
still on
I turned you off now it's off alright
awesome
I'm expecting this to be a bit of a
process I don't remember the last time I
live-streamed building a water cooling
loop from scratch but if I've ever done
that before it probably wasn't a great
time so I'm gonna go as quickly as I can
here to make sure that I'm valuing your
guys's time but I also don't want to end
up with a leak on my hands or more
importantly on my motherboards so I'm
gonna try and also be somewhat careful
so first things first you come on over
here Brent and I'll come around this
side of the table so you can get a
pretty decent look at what we're doing
so first things first we're gonna go
ahead and mount our CPU block now
Corsair one of the things that they do
so well like these AIO kits absolutely
have a value is they have a really good
mounting mechanisms just for simple nuts
here especially on LGA 2066 and whatever
the other one is bloody pins does this
socket have this 2066 right are we still
on 2066 pins 79 80 XC heck yeah alright
my brain hasn't completely fallen apart
yeah that's good so just so you guys
know I'm using one of these IC thermal
pads so this was less about that they're
the best performance in the world
because they're not quite there just our
clothes and more about that I wanted
easily reproducible results so I didn't
want a slate I only get one shot at this
because we're doing it live so I didn't
want a slight smear in the compound or
something like that to affect our
results all right so we're gonna talk
the way our Corsair radiator so in terms
of noise level Corsair does such a good
job of managing thermals and noise so it
was 53 degrees and it was sort of a low
there's a low hum this one I'm actually
expecting to be pretty similar just
based on what I saw from plugging in the
fans so I'm happy about that because I
think in terms of noise level it's gonna
be pretty comparable with that said I
don't think the performance of these
fans is going to be anywhere near
Corsairs so this is their H 100 I Pro so
it comes with their maglev fans which
are just spectacular fans the last I'm
not gonna say forever but they will last
a very long time because the bearing
doesn't even make any contact it's
pretty pretty sick technology only
problem is this cost like twice as much
so these might be kind of flimsy ER
things but there's a pretty low bar in
terms of how they have to perform in
order to do better and this block who
knows might have an advantage so come on
in here Brandon we're gonna go ahead and
oh wow did not think of this uh-oh so
this block has the whole alignment for
LGA 2066
so you can see it's got a big enough
plate which is good that means we're not
completely sunk yet but it doesn't have
the mounting adaptor that you need to
screw into the built-in mount for LGA
2066
it's a bolt through so no I'm not going
to so we're gonna have to improvise a
little here now I do have an idea if
these screws happen to be threaded the
same as the motherboard mount maybe we
can put them in from the top maybe
that's their intent maybe if they'd
included a manual I would know these
things for sure
power supply jumper no it's fine I'm
good we're going we're going full Yolo
Jake this there's no there's no yeah I
got paper towel yeah don't worry okay
not quite full Yolo okay so good news
yes these screws do thread in so you can
see that they go in but you can see
we've got a lot of extra space here and
I don't know if the included Springs are
quite enough Martha Sean I guess so
we're gonna go ahead and load this up
with a plastic washer a spring and
another plastic washer I don't think
that's gonna be enough I put that in yep
that's clearly pretty loose now the
thing is some of these motherboards oh I
don't know at least some of them oh okay
now we're getting into pretty risky
territory here some of these
motherboards actually have like just a
plastic thing in between and you can you
can poke like a through-hole mount
through it without damaging the PCB of
the motherboard but the thing is I don't
really have a way to find out without
just trying it so I guess that's what
we're going to do oh yeah so you can
actually hopefully see here there's
actually a hole in the PCB and it's just
like a plastic stopper there so if we
just kind of jam this in here it's
possible that we'll be able to bolt it
through from the bottom oh oh oh heck
yeah I really wish I had a drill right
now cuz this is gonna take a little
while but I think we're in
all right so stupid so we're gonna go
ahead and throw a plastic washer on here
that's really important because we don't
want the metal head of the screw to be
right up against the back of the PCB of
your motherboard here and we're gonna go
ahead and screw this puppy in yes I will
reposition my thermal pad
let's Jake I'm not the one who forgot to
take off a protective cover yesterday
hey if you guys follow us on twitter
that was Jake who forgot to take the
cover off the bottom of a CPU lock you
know what though I can't give him too
much heat about it though because four
years four years I could say with a
straight face I've never done that in
all my years of building computers I
have never forgotten to take the
protective cover off the bottom of the
heat sink or a CPU block and then I
don't remember when it was exactly
that's been about a year ago I like
finally did it and I didn't even realize
it until I was like taking the system
apart because it wasn't a system that I
was using for thermal benchmarks or
anything like that
and it was a relatively low power one
like was LGA 1150 something and it was a
really good cooler so it actually was
like good enough that the CPU wasn't
thermal throttling or anything it just
obviously wasn't running as cool as it
could have if I didn't have a piece of
plastic in between the I think it was a
water block in between the block and
what's that yeah you figured it out
right away all right well good for you
I mean you were doing thermal testing on
the system it's actually a really cool
system that he's working on shoot I'm
letting myself get distracted here and
I'm making mistakes this is how these
things happen you know when you're
trying to film a video I forgot to put
my plastic washer on this one and as I
said before that would be an
extraordinarily bad time now there's
actually a good chance that would be
fine but I'm not going to roll that die
today die being the key word
as long as there's no traces actually
right around there then all you're doing
is you're just mashing some like you
know copper and fiberglass jump together
like it doesn't really matter but if
there is a trace nearby and you short it
or you crack it then your board probably
won't work unless it's like a portal or
something and even then it might not
work or it might have like really weird
behavior that it takes two years to
figure out oh that was the problem all
along I guess I should have broken my
stuff okay well I did not anticipate how
long this would take my bad everyone oh
I guess I could read some super chats if
they were over here hey Jake can I can I
trouble you to retrieve for me my laptop
could you put it right there on the
keyboard and maybe I could read super
chats while I do this
cool okay all the ones I'm looking at
now are just dollar amounts so Thank You
wolf star and 1984 lab rat and I can't
really read this very well and and see a
crag or whatever that is drew still
plays would you recommend the rads alone
from bang good I would recommend any
radiator that is not made of aluminum
honestly I mean the thing with radiators
is that the best way to get better
performance out of a water cooling loop
okay and this is Jamo just my opinion
because there are definitely
characteristics of radiators that make
one perform better than another one but
the best way to get more performance out
of radiators my perspective is to add
more of them some of them will have
lower pressure drop so you can put more
things in a loop and without
compromising your flow rate some of them
will perform better with particular fans
or with other fans but to me radiators
have kind of always been kind of like
splitting hairs and if you really want
more performance out of your loop just
throw another one in get a bigger Tower
throw in another red the one thing I
would watch out for is to make sure that
they're not made of aluminum I
never recommend an aluminum radiator
it's there's no benefit you only save
like a few bucks compared to a a brass
radiator and for what for the risk of
corrosion for the risk of potentially
destroying your whole loop like I don't
think it's an unreasonable additional
cost to spend a little bit more on your
rad in the first place
shoot there was something I was gonna
say right I just want to be I just want
to be very clear though sorry it takes
actually a fair bit of pressure on the
bottom here to punch through these
stupid plastic things I'm not saying
that you can't have any aluminum in your
radiator I'm just saying that it can't
be anywhere that contacts the water so a
lot of radiators use aluminum for the
little fins that go in between the water
tubes that's fine aluminum's dissipative
characteristics are actually excellent
so using aluminum air is just fine and
dandy it's just the rest of it needs to
be brass which is similar enough to
copper that you don't end up with a ton
of galvanic corrosion or it needs to be
copper copper radiators are actually
quite rare the most common material is a
brass core with or like brass end tanks
with aluminum fins alright so a couple
false starts there on these through-hole
mounting screws but we are finally in
and hopefully this melts alright okay on
the bench there we are
alright it's stuck um you you've got to
be kidding me
laughs there we go okay this was kind of
jamming it in there all right so we're
gonna reposition our thermal pad here
can you see that okay Brennen you want
me to lower this table okay cool I'm
gonna throw that on there
and theoretically this is now as simple
as throwing one of our washers here now
we don't actually don't technically need
this washer here it's actually for the
other side of the board where you put
the nut but hey it's on there now so I
guess we'll protect our hold-down plate
from getting scratched that's the only
possible benefit of what I'm doing right
now
it will also actually increase the
mounting tension a little bit but
probably not an appreciable amount wait
are these not screwing on wait what is
it oh that's this one oh I was like I
took these nuts off these bolts how is
this not going on not fair not fair PC
gods
the PC gods they are a harsh and cruel
mistress
all right so I'm gonna go down until I
don't know the thumb nut is kind of a
little lower than flush with the the
bullet there all right we're gonna call
that on there pretty good
now we just need to plumb up the rest of
our loop hey Jake could I get a pair of
scissors sorry I really did intend to
prepare for this stream but you know me
thank you
have you ever took an ax look taking a
look at the master air gee 100 M it
looks like an arc reactor from Ironman I
have it and I get great temps honestly
we kind of did away with with case
reviews a little while back just because
before sorry I know I have water wait
where'd it go I filled up my orange
water bottle well if you don't mind
finding my orange water bottle that
would be swell I don't think it's in
here it might be over by the sink over
there I was just gonna use tap water
because like realistically I'm not
leaving this set up for
where was I going yeah we kind of did
away with case reviews a while back just
because there wasn't a whole there's not
a whole lot you can do to eliminate
variables on a case in terms of testing
its performance like you can try but
you're always going to end up with like
you know what's the right answer do you
fill every fan slot or do you run every
case with the same number of fans you
know how do you make concessions in some
cases for you know more X more out for
like ones that are designed for compact
builds versus ones that are designed for
bigger ones do you hold them all to the
same standard and just report the temps
and and the acoustics how do you measure
the acoustics of a case like there were
a lot of questions that we could just
never find good answers for and if
you're just going to evaluate the
aesthetics and the ease of building in
them honestly I kind of found the video
we did recently which was kind of a live
stream like this one of just building in
a case I found that was probably the
best way for me to tackle it but that
won't include kind of detailed thermal
analysis or anything like that it's just
a quick build okay this is not working I
cannot get this over the barbed ow I
wish I had pliers right now sucks like
digging into my fingers yes yes I know
you're supposed to use pliers I was
hoping to do with my hands because I
don't have pliers I give up we're just
gonna roll without them no I'm good
I mean honestly that's enough of a bulge
I'm not concerned that it'll leak to be
clear I would never install it long-term
like this because it will leak
eventually these these tubing's tend to
kind of stiffen up over time and when
they're kind of held like this that
becomes their new home and then they can
easily kind of stretch a little bit a
little bit more or the water can can
slip past them but when they're still in
there kind of fresh tight state like
this and you stretch them over something
and so they're not really a concern I'm
far more worried about this o-ring here
alright so that's on there there's our
rad now we just need our reservoir which
does actually have a mount
that comes with this thing but we're not
gonna bother with that we're just gonna
maybe can I pull it no okay um I was
actually kind of hoping to just find
something that I could strap it to oh oh
yes this is a perfect opportunity to
plug the LTTE cable tie get a close up
there Brennen LTTE logo LTT store comm
we've got that there we've also got the
Linus tech tips water bottle our next
shipment is coming I think in 2 or 3
weeks something like that really excited
for those those have been an absolute
smash hit like we don't actually sell a
ton of merch I'm not saying our audience
is a bunch of cheapskates I'm just
saying that they say that on YouTube you
tend to connect with people who are kind
of like you that's sort of the value of
YouTube and I'm a big cheapskate
we don't sell a lot of merch I'll say
this I'll say that much but the water
bottle has been just a smash hit because
it looks really cool it's got like
functionality that matters it's you know
vacuum-sealed long that kind of cool
stuff yeah so I'm excited to get more of
those oh man trust me this is a high
quality cable type that's not actually
the issue I just didn't have it tight
enough there we go my yeah I did I did
thank you okay so there's my res let's
go ahead and cut a little bit of tubing
to go between our our pump and our
reservoir here just like a little little
baby one like that Shoop oh that was not
a clean cut that's bad especially
because I'm not putting clamps on this I
don't want to leave any danglies like
that so I'm just gonna do a better job
one key when you're cutting tubing if
you don't have a proper tubing cutters
to roll it as you're cutting it that we
actually do get a pretty clean cut yay
Linus Pro soft water cooling tips no one
cares about those anymore because it's
all about hardline now but whatever all
right now where do I need to go next so
I'm gonna go out - sure let's go - here
in the notes there easy peasy
just so you guys know I'm not going to
the radiator first because
I believe that the going to the radiator
first affects the CPU temps in some
meaningful way actually had a bit of a
debate with fusty from gamers Nexus
about whether the loop order matters he
was like oh should we go to the CPU
first or the GPU first which one are we
trying to overclock harder and I was
like what are you talking about and he
was like yeah the loop order matters and
and I was like I really don't think so
and I was like look do I need to make a
video proving you wrong and he's like
bring it on be my guest so I'm actually
kind of considering making a video about
whether loop order matters now that I've
said this though he's probably gonna go
ahead and make the video we'll see we'll
see we'll see maybe he won't maybe he
won't love Steve
love Steve we had a really good time
when he was up here for the roast did a
couple videos together go check out his
channel it's gamers Nexus he did a
couple videos while he was here one kind
of profiling us and how we make our
videos what was what was the other one
he did Jake do you remember what the
other one was the what sorry yeah oh
yeah he did a tour of our office that
actually includes some information that
had never never been seen before we lost
in that up there in his drops minute
there we go okay so I just need another
one more tubing right here this is oh
this is kind of an awkward tubing run
anyway I love Steve but water cooling is
something I do actually know a fair bit
about and so I was kind of thinking
maybe I'll maybe I'll make that video
but maybe I'll be wrong so maybe I just
shouldn't make the video no we should
make it regardless because I'd want to
know if I was wrong this is the
stupidest funnel I think I have ever
seen in my life
look at this it's not even that much
bigger like it doesn't increase the size
of the target much at all I'm still I'm
gonna use it I'm gonna use it because I
paid for it but I'm not gonna like it
I need to grab a molex molex cable here
oh wow it's almost like I planned that
and no no I didn't yeah you're not gonna
see this
I can barely see what I'm doing here I'm
just gonna have to do it by feel boom
he's that good folks okay well good luck
everybody
let's get some paper towel it's just
speed let's be proactive you know I
don't want to be reactive reactive is so
1995 proactive not amateur active you
know pro right there pull that move
right there I just really don't want to
lose this board so rampage six extreme
or whatever the heck it is really
expensive board and Gary from Asus is a
really nice guy but if I break another
board and I'm like hey Gary actually
it's not even me who breaks most of the
boards around here to be very clear but
if we break another board name a board
he'll send it but I know he'll be like
he'll be making comments you know
comments you like those guys okay now in
fairness most of the boards break
because we're doing things that
shouldn't be done so you guys don't have
to this is not gonna work like look at
look at this Pinner little this is just
stupid okay it actually works
surprisingly well
Jake because I'm using the funnel
because I paid for it he asked why I
don't just take the top off the res did
you pay for this funnel didn't think so
so you don't have to use it but I did
I actually am totally going to keep that
funnel because I used to have a little
metal funnel that I kept in here that
was really handy whenever you're like
desperate and it's better than nothing
and I lost it and so yeah I'm gonna I'm
gonna put it in my little bag of tricks
here all right
ah so that's it we're ready for our
power cycle now let's go ahead and throw
our graphics card back on here I am
really hoping for the best here I would
hate for you guys to have invested like
half an hour into this video or however
long sorry we've been in streaming for
an hour wait what what time is it it's
too okay well I would hate for you guys
to have invested two hours and also me
having invested two hours only to find
out that it doesn't work a one-hour
whatever who's keeping track okay
clearly not me oh you okay oh yes
yes thank you okay um well come on come
on in Brandon if it blows up you don't
want to miss it right you don't want to
get the camera wet you're not gonna get
the camera wet geez hey okay all right
now we're gonna do another round of
filling now one thing that sort of blows
is that this round of testing will
inherently take longer because of our
reservoir there's far more water in our
loop this time so it will take longer to
reach equilibrium so I'm gonna have to
figure out how to stall you guys for at
least 20 minutes while we wait for it to
warm up you know what we should have
done Oh Jake you know what we should
have done we should have warmed up the
water
so we wouldn't have to wait so long oh
I've already mostly filled it okay
put hot water and the rest of this if
you don't mind Jake I want hot water in
the rest of that container like empty it
and then put in the hottest water you
can it's fine
no it's a fine idea don't worry it just
means we'll reach equilibrium faster
that's all dang it that's not gonna be a
lot of hot water
I like this reservoir actually does a
reasonable job of not sucking up too
many of the big bubbles
once it kind of settles in it'll be
better to and this pumps not bad
definitely noticeably louder than the
one included with Corsairs kit but it
also moves the water pretty pretty well
so we can't quite evaluate it until we
put it for one thing it's a vibration
deadening pad under it and for another
until we wait for the bubbles to work
their way out of the loop this solution
is going to be louder though stop James
you want that phone I'm gonna have to
change the pin for you or actually here
just enroll a fingerprint a pin would be
easier alright okay one moment please
all right yeah I'm live stream do you
mind actually pointing away because I
don't want anyone was like a real pin
yeah point at James you ever point at
the computer alright let seems like a
pretty good idea hey you are sir
Boop oh wow that actually quieted right
down once it stopped sucking up so many
bubbles now it still does have a bit of
an like here if I get my mic right next
to it you have got to be kidding me
thank you Dave yeah that would be really
unfortunate because this would
SuperDuper be for nothing
all of it we'd have to like we'd have to
redo the video like just do it as a
standard upload sorry guys lol okay that
made no difference whatsoever I
shouldn't have bothered with that better
well so bad just
yeah but 20 this Microsoft this is what
you do this is what you cause 20,000
people are waiting for you right now
twenty thousand a hundred I'm already
gone cuz they're like no I wanna deal
with this that's what you do
let's have a look at some brijesh send a
thousand ringgit i don't know how much
that is says love from India Thank You
brijesh no idea what a thousand ringgit
is but I appreciate it

courtesy of Kenny Ronald says just
ordered a lynx level four from digital
storm cool story xanthus says isn't
jake's testbench set up for water
cooling ah not for a while I don't think
it is right now okay wait what's going
on here hold on a minute what's going on
is this doing things right now oh yes oh
wow it's leaking pretty good oh man okay
okay so yeah it actually bottoms out and
you can see here we've got we've got
water pooled around the the bottom of
the fittings it's actually only this one
right here this one seems to have held
up so this is a high-risk maneuver but
to say that run and see there I'm gonna
grab the wrench and I'm gonna see if we
can give her just a a little more here
so I'm gonna pull this red key out first
okay let's give her a little more
arrghh okay
okay where's my paper towel weird my
paper towel at so I'm just gonna take
this kind of soaked one here and top up
the rest of it I'm gonna throw this new
one in here what could go wrong that is
a serious design flaw every once in a
while you encounter a product and you go
did anyone ever try this before putting
it in a box and shipping it to a
customer and I don't mean this
particular unit the one I'm holding
right now I mean this product the Antec
dark flea DF 85 was a great example of
that it had these just astonishingly
stupid like modular hard drive cages
that basically got in the way of any
modern high end GPU at the time and then
it had these just incredibly dumb like
brackets that sat in front of the five
and a quarter inch optical base that
just served no purpose at all so because
they were just like kind of a bar you
could press the button on your on your
DVD Drive and it would like try to open
and it would jam up against the thing
but there was no mechanism for it to
automatically open so they were just you
could still see your optical drives so
they didn't stealth them they were just
in the way and there was no clean way to
remove them other than just like
breaking them off and leaving like a nub
in there like it was just just an
incredibly terrible case I was right
around the time that an tech went from
the king of PC cases to basically
irrelevant over a span of like a few
years yeah yeah all right cool we're
back up we are not leaking anymore that
was a terrible solution though and we're
gonna go ahead and fire up our prime95
here so first we can take a look at our
idle temps although it should be noted
that these aren't that representative
necessarily because the Corsair cooler
had been running for
about five to eight minutes before we
fired up the camera okay so we're
sitting at 33 degrees oh well that
doesn't that doesn't really bode well
okay I mean this is what the same
thermal compound so if it doesn't manage
to yeah Wow yeah there you go 33 34
degrees okay slow it degrees oh all
right well we can really do is hit it
now small FFT boom there it goes
show me that 86 huh thank goodness oh
I've never been so happy to see a weird
issue not fixed 86 87 % CPU utilization
so for better for worse our test is
running the same as it did last time now
Jake where'd we settle in 53 degrees all
right so I should probably read some
super chats while we wait to see if if
our banggood.com full-custom water will
actually no I'm gonna do a quick recap
for you guys so what we've got on the
bench now is our $80.00 water cooling
kit from banggood.com because as we
mentioned in our recent video about AIO
water coolers versus high-end air
coolers and AIO might cost more look
cooler but it doesn't necessarily
deliver better performance or quieter
operation compared to a really good air
cooler what we acknowledged in that
video however is that fully custom water
cooling will outperform either of those
if it's implemented correctly so today's
objective was to find out if a cheap
custom water cooling kit like this $80
one from banggood.com qualifies as fully
custom water cooling or if it just plain
doesn't cut the mustard we're getting
pretty close to our conclusion guys ooh
this is gonna be a bit of a shocker but
I'm gonna go ahead and just go through a
couple of these have you tried removing
the C Drive thanks Eric
no I haven't smokey says I bet you have
casual Friday enabled
no I always look like this biking with
panda looks like it scratches at level
one with deeper grooves at level two if
you know what I'm saying
I know what you're saying I Castillo
says what do you guys do with all the
extra tech lying around do you ever
resell it or donate it to schools
believe it or not we hold on to the vast
majority of it because you never know
when you're gonna need to compare this
year's high-end graphics card against to
last year's high-end graphics card like
if we'd thrown away all of our 10 Series
GPUs then when Anthony was trying to do
his piece that's coming really soon on
running r-tx
on 10 Series we like might not have had
one handy with that said we are looking
to purge some stuff over the next little
bit we're trying to figure out how the
accounting works for us to dump it on
the ltte store so stay tuned for that we
might do that hey over here says FAQ you
Linus I read it
smokey be 42 so subtly threatened it put
a broken case on the desk I don't know
what you're talking about
Aleksey t says by the amount of
technical problems you'd think it's a
land show thank you for the 200 rubles
I'll put that towards improving these
bye cliff Candice does love this video
idea the first five times you made it
I'm sure this one will be just I have
not done this exact video before
Aliexpress water cooling did I do that
you did that that was different though
we bought all the custom parts this is a
kit it's totally different I mean it's
just random parts with no instructions
so someone else bought random parts and
sold it to us
apparently the name on float plane is
wrong did you fix that at any point all
right I think it's a little late why is
this guy hosting Anthony tech tip says
Alex Lee all right thank you ladies and
gentlemen I think we have a conclusion
so that worked out pretty well where we
didn't have to actually wait the whole
20-30 minutes come on in come on come on
down Brandon Lee so here's our power
consumption right there and the 140
150 watt range just as we were expecting
same as last time and this is not good
it's at 62 degrees already we've only
been up for about five minutes
the worst part and this is very Oh oops
one moment please whoops um whoops okay
look we all make mistakes especially
when we're live-streaming
let's go ahead and okay well that was
definitely a demonstration of you know
how water can absorb heat if I was
really clever I would have been like aha
I did it on purpose remember how I
wanted to heat up the water so that we
would reach equilibrium faster you know
what I like that story I'm gonna stick
with that yeah I know I totally forgot
okay so these fans are on now so that's
good yes they're blue let's go make sure
we've got all the air bladder out of
this as well while we're at it
ooh that radiator is a hot boy whoa wow
these fans really do not move a lot of
air huh well that's really unfortunate
because I'd say if this had better fans
on it it would definitely be it would
definitely be a closer contender anyway
we're gonna we're gonna see how it how
it turns out here but I wouldn't be
surprised based on how little air these
are moving if we actually don't end up
cooling off that much the good news is
we have time to read a few more Super
chats from you kind folks where'd they
go ah
dr. Mobius says J's two cents already
did a loop order video improved it
doesn't matter yes in fact I might have
done one at one point I don't know you
make 4000 videos eventually you forget a
couple of them but there are ways that
we could demonstrate it scientifically
that I'm sure Steve would appreciate and
I don't know how Jay did it but if he
just did it by like plumbing up a CPU
and a GPU then plumbing up a GPU and a
CPU the thermal sensors that he's
working with are just simply not
accurate enough to prove beyond a shadow
of a doubt that it makes no difference
phonics says hello from cube coders tell
John oh and Anthony we say hi we're
happy to be working with you guys I
actually didn't know we were working
with them and I don't know who they are
but I guess I will soon uh wild card
says a live stream a trip to Home
Hardware for pliers no the IRL category
has enough nonsense live streams at this
point we don't need to go to Home
Hardware for pliers chaco the scholar
says who benefits the most from liquid
cooling intel or AMD like so many intel
versus AMD questions the answer is just
not that simple and afraid both AMD and
Intel have products that will benefit
more from water cooling and have
products that will benefit less from
water cooling something like a rise in
526 hundred probably doesn't benefit
from water cooling pretty much at all
you throw a decent air cooler on that
thing and you're gonna overclock it as
far as it'll go anyway
Zen architectures overclocking is
limited not by thermals in most cases
but rather just by hard architectural
limits it only clocks so high so Intel
also has CPUs like for example a Core i5
they'd finally launched their 9 Series
non-case cues but anything any way
anything that's a non case cue if you
can't overclock it as long as it's not
running at like 100 degrees all the time
because you installed it in a Mac it's
not gonna it's not going to have any
benefit because the CPU only goes faster
when the clock speed goes faster
but then again Intel an AMD also both
have processors that definitely benefit
from water cooling something like 32
core thread Ripper or Intel's 28 core
Xeon w those are both going to benefit
from water cooling even if not to go
faster definitely just to run quieter
Rahl Rahl asks why do I hate Star Trek I
don't hate Star Trek did I did I ever
indicate in some way I hate Star Trek
Jake and I wasn't a Star Trek kid I was
a Star Wars kid so the only thing that
really ever made me mad about Star Trek
was people being like oh cool you
watching Star Trek and be like no it's
not Star Trek because Star Wars is not
the same to Star Trek but that's it I
don't like hate Star Trek or anything
I mean I'd probably have some unpopular
positive views of Star Trek I really
liked the reboot I know a lot of people
didn't but I did
so there you go reboot movies okay in my
book I never watched Discovery I was I'm
a lot older than you I was a next
generation kid oh I haven't I don't know
I don't have time to watch TV shows I've
been busy playing actually I've been
I've been busy playing like the best
game that I've probably played in years
lately if you like retro RPGs so if you
were like No so they I mean they
obviously localized it for Japan but no
it was I believe it was a Western team
working on it cross-code fantastic if
you loved a games like Chrono Trigger
Final Fantasy 6 Final Fantasy 7 Secret
of Mana that series it's like it's like
a retro kind of snaps generation sprite
based RPG real-time combat very
challenging combat challenging puzzles
if you don't adjust the difficulty I
didn't I was like determined to beat the
stupid thing on the regular difficulty
so it's got like these timed puzzles so
you have to go through and do everything
like perfectly as things that anyway I'm
not gonna spoil anything about it but I
mean really it's like I'd always kind of
had it in the back of my mind that if I
just if I ever had just like way too
much money and no
idea what to do with it I wanted to like
resurrect that style of RPG where it's
really not about the graphics it's not
about the cinematic cutscenes there's no
voice acting purely text-based just
great musical score and a fantastic a
gripping story and cross-code did an
absolutely fantastic job of it I finally
finished it last night and I put like
it's like 60 hours into it so for how
much that game costs I think it's like
$15 or something like that on Steam I
don't remember how much I paid it was
probably less because I got it on like
the Halloween sale or something but 20
bucks for 20 bucks it's fantastic you
should just get it absolutely loved the
combat system it never got boring
if I had to criticize one thing about it
I would say some of the dungeons dragged
on a little bit and there's one point
where you you you go to a place and
you're kind of like I'm not really gonna
have to do two of those dungeons in a
row am i and then you do without like
any story connective tissue in between
them really so I think they could have
paced it a little bit better but other
than that I just thought it was
absolutely fantastic 10 of 10 in my book
best game I've played a long time if I'm
being honest with myself if I don't
allow myself to look through my
nostalgia glasses it's probably better
than Final Fantasy 6 but I would have to
replay 6 in order to say that
definitively I don't know the characters
are just some of them in particular just
fantastic absolutely lovable anyway the
good news is I think we're done here
so it's not as dramatic a loss but our
banggood.com water cooling kit is
officially worse than an AI ohh
now to be clear this is an excellent AI
oh but of course there has ones that are
a lot less expensive that would also be
like more price competitive and would
easily be performance competitive with
this this doesn't like
absolutely trounced their other a iOS
it's not like a 10 degree difference or
anything like that and this is 4 degrees
more so what that leaves us with is that
this is custom water cooling but at a
performance level that is just not
better than high-end air or a decent AIO
liquid cooler also it comes with some
additional risks you've got a no-name
pump you've got a block that was not
tapped correctly for the threads that
were included in the box and you've got
an aluminum radiator which like I said
having it physically away from the
copper CPU block is a lot better than
having them right next to each other but
does pose entirely unnecessary risks in
the long term so thank you very much
guys for coming along for the journey
and thank you too I fix it who sponsored
this video with their essential
electronics toolkit I forget exactly
what the talking points are so what I'm
going to do is just go through
everything that's included with it it's
got one of their fantastic basically
indestructible pry tools it's got one of
their sputters which I used earlier on
in the stream to kind of pick at
something which is exactly what that's
for it's got their convenient rotating
driver kit with the nice rubberized grip
in here it's got five ten sixteen of the
most common bits including some security
Torx ha's some slots some pentalobe 's
some Phillips heads a tri wing CA
Nintendo it's got their ESD safe
tweezers their suction cup for removing
screens and a couple of their picks
along with the Jimmy tool so you can get
your own for just $19.99 at I fix it
calm slash Linus wait what I fix dot GD
/ 2 capital L 6 small Q small I small K
capital W go for it oh yeah comes a
lifetime warranty so thanks for watching
guys if you disliked this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description uh sorry
change the fans for the MLS you guys
know I have other stuff to do today
right
Brandon are you able to do it cuz if
you're done we can be done you sure I
know I'm sorry Brent you guys know
Brandon is dying right like Brandon is
an absolute super trooper he has here
you guys look this is what you're doing
to him
right now you guys look like it's fine
but you better thank him that's all I'm
saying
this is what he's equipped with right
now that's what you're making him hold
for two hours two hours look at him look
at his face look at his eyes you can't
you can't see it you can't see it it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter he's
suffering that's my point
I'm sorry Brandon I promise to never do
this to you again except if it
accidently happens like this all right
we're going quick here I'll go as fast
as I possibly can because we really do
have other videos to shoot today it's
2:20 why am I doing this clearly lost my
mind this is what this is what happens
this is the will of the people this is
how much we care okay Linus Media Group
you guys want to know what's the
variable here if I was willing to spend
another $60 on fans because those ml's
the holes are not cheap would this
perform better I don't know but I will
soon so what have we settle in it 56 57
okay
so I'm not gonna stick around for the
final result because I think it's gonna
be a very small difference but I will
stick around to see what direction we
move in all right
agreed everybody cool with that are they
cool with that Jake I can't monitor the
chat right now I'm busy doing this fan
swap I wait for the stream delay cool
cool all right we got this okay
Brent's so everyone in chat thank you
yes Brendan does rock and know his pain
is not your joy Brandon is a good person
and he doesn't deserve pain I should buy
Brendan lunch you know what I'll tell
you what I I will I'm gonna I'm gonna
spend the next super chat on Brandon's
lunch it doesn't actually work that way
it will have to be money out of my own
pocket technically because I don't
really there's one for two bucks and one
for five euros well okay there you go
there you go Brandon ten bucks okay ten
bucks towards your lunch today
Brandon doesn't like mucho way to not
way to not know your coworkers Jake
wow what a millennial that's probably
why he never goes for lunch with you
Jake because you took him to Chipotle
everyone knows Brandon doesn't like
Chipotle Brandon never shuts up about
not liking Chipotle the second anyone
mentions to pollies like I don't like to
pull away I don't want to pull a
Chipotle is awesome
fully eight ten out of ten endorsed to
pull a no Brendon only gets ten bucks
now they're just throwing it away lunch
only cost so much there you go ten
dollars for Brandon okay tell you what
no no cuz ten dollars isn't really
enough there you go okay fifteen dollars
for Brandon stop dipping Brandon cuz I'm
not giving him anymore it's not really
the way this works like I can't I
there's there's no tax write-off on this
like hey that's post tax money I'll
explain it to you guys when you're older
but expensing things in a business is
really important all right so these are
running they're running off the same
headers as the whatever whatever these
are the deep cool fans that we had
before and we're going to give this a
minute
there's definitely there's definitely
or airflow coming through particularly
out here around the edges I think we're
getting a bit of a better seal with
these because these deep cool ones have
an even dumber round frame design no I'm
it doesn't work that way okay guys it
doesn't work that way yeah so here's the
thing guys I do not expect this to make
like an enormous difference yeah it's
not immediately dropping like this is
not a night and day difference and by
the time you go when you spend this kind
of money on new fans for your
banggood.com loop you might have you
might as well have just gotten a better
block a better pump better radiator and
put crappy fans on it like that's where
you're getting most of the additional
performance better rad better block so
no sorry guys didn't work peace out
see you again on the next Friday stream
yes you can just leave me sitting here
awkwardly or you can kill the stream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
