now if you guys are consumers unless you
are very high-end consumers this may not
be in the realm of sort of what you
would buy but if you're an SMB or if you
are you know once again a very high-end
consumer something like this might
appeal to you
so I've done a couple ups unboxings in
the past on NCIX tech tips we have done
an episode about what is a UPS what is
what is the point however we're gonna
cover a little bit of that again and
we're going to cover a little bit of
what makes this particular one special
so this is a UPS from up gps you can see
in this soft foam packaging how we're a
fairly hard soft foam because these
things are heavy they are serious
business heavy because they have very
very heavy batteries inside them that
keep your computer running for minutes
at a time in the event of a power outage
so let's go through some of the
accessories first before we get into a
little bit more abut phone line so
that'll prevent surges from affecting
your phone serial cable in case you
actually still want to manage your UPS
to be a serial we've also got their
Sentinel software included which is
compatible with a wide variety of
operating systems we have a user's guide
for the durable series ds1000 1500 2000
and 3000 ok and let's go ahead and take
this one out so the one we have here is
the DS 1500 beat it is you know what
really have you give me a sec guys
so the DS 1500 beat can run for about
five minutes on a full load assuming
that you are actually pulling 1050 watts
from it at the time that the power fails
or whatever else so in the event that
you have a very high-end gaming machine
or something hooked up to it and you're
actually doing something intensive you
have video rendering in the background
while you're playing a game you actually
have a few minutes to close everything
down and then you buy yourself a little
bit more time in order to
shut down the computer properly because
when it's at a 50% low it can actually
run for about 15 minutes about 14
minutes so I didn't mention before about
1500 bullpen is basically equivalent to
1050 watts so unless you have a really
high-end computer this is pretty much
gonna do it for you
it's also a double conversion design
which means that there is zero counter
time during a power outages eliminating
any possible downtime now let's have a
look at the unit physically you can see
on the back we've got two groups of
outlets we've got a total of six outlets
we've also got a 15 amp circuit breaker
so in the event that you actually
overload the unit itself although I'd
imagine I mean I guess if you're doing a
pure pasture you could actually pull
more than 15 amps from about 15 amps
would be more than the actual capacity
that it's able to sustain off the
battery itself so you wouldn't really
want to overload it any more than that
1050 watts because you're not gonna get
the benefit should the power actually
fail which isn't to say that you don't
get any benefit from it if it doesn't
provide a battery backup because this
particular unit will actually clean the
power that is going through it and can
dynamically switch between battery mode
which would be on line mode and just a
pass-through mode in order to make sure
that if there's some kind of fluctuation
for example if you guys know what a
brown node is that's where the lights
kind of flicker a little bit because the
electricity in your house just goes a
little bit wonky maybe someone turned on
the microwave or the clothes dryer
whatever the case may be this will
completely protect the equipment that is
connected to it by dynamically switching
what mode it's in in order to make sure
it's as clean as possible
it also will correct the power going
through it and is compatible because it
is a pure sine-wave unit with any
devices even power supplies that use
active power factor correction which is
pretty much any modern power supply you
can see it has an LCD readout on the
front as well as a couple limited
buttons not a whole lot here just giving
you indications of the major things that
can go wrong with it
it has a dynamically control pin so in
theory you shouldn't get too loud
although this is a serious piece of
equipment and in general when you get
past the consumer level stuff you know
it tends to be not all that quiet this
is mostly recommended for use on things
like servers even medical equipment
boats or like I said again very very
high-end consumer stuff it also has an
optional SM SNMP card available so you
can do network and remote monitoring the
U P of the UPS via web browser and check
this emergency power out it's taped down
so hopefully you won't accidentally hit
it but this will actually bypass any of
the set down procedures that the UPS has
if you go ahead and pull it out we've
got our serial port there remember it
had a serial cable with it I definitely
figure that for most modern systems
you're gonna be using usb which isn't to
say you won't use serial because there's
a lot of stuff that does still use
serial as well we've got our Ethernet in
and out as well as I think that's pretty
much it for the back so I was
complaining it was heavy before just so
you guys know it actually weighs about
40 pounds it has some other pretty cool
features including managing the battery
so it's at a 100% charge all the time as
well as managing the battery in the
event that it's running off of battery
mode so if the power fails or it goes
completely haywire in some kind of way
that would damage your equipment it
actually prevents the battery from going
completely dead which can damage it now
I want to clarify something I said
before sorry I said online meant it was
running off the battery no online refers
to the instantaneous switching in the
event that it does need to run off of
the battery so sorry about that I think
that pretty much covers everything that
I wanted to say about this guy one of
the things that we're actually going to
be using it for on top of protecting our
equipment here in the tectum slab is
we're going to be using it to monitor
power consumption when we do some of our
videos where we're comparing the power
consumption of various parts because the
equipment that we've been using to
measure it in the past has been pretty
cheesy stuff like 15 bucks that sort of
the local Walmart counting so we're
gonna get away from that we're gonna
start using this guy or one of its
younger brothers depending on which lab
we're working out of in order to measure
the power consumption that we're drawing
from the wall and the other effect that
that will have is it will also clean the
power it's delivering to the computer so
it'll it'll protect us in the event of
something
like when we're flashing bios's and we
corrupt a bios which we've had happen
because the power went out while we were
doing it like the freaked out
fortunately the board had a bio switch
so we managed to solve it to the board
it'll protect us from that it will make
our equipment last longer because we're
delivering more stable power to it and
it'll also give us better readings
because the wall power can fluctuate
which will actually when the voltages
fluctuate it can actually affect the
power consumption a little bit of the
device is connected because there's some
wonkiness involved in the conversion
because this is going to clean it and
provide exactly 120 volts output at all
or 115 volts output at any given time we
should also get more stable numbers
especially when we're trying to do
things like measure the idle power
consumption or the low power consumption
of a gaming machine so thank you for
checking out this unboxing and don't
forget subscribe Glenn's tickets for
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos a couple things I forgot
actually it has user replaceable battery
there's an available extended battery
and in additional to the available like
extended battery you can also run an
external battery so you can power the
equipment that is plugged into it for
hours at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
