the reality of it is I didn't have a
card so now I do I have a Radeon 60 790
this is a one gig graphics card from ATI
or AMD if you'd prefer no AMD ATI if you
prefer although you'd be wrong
AMD is the correct one so it's a one gig
part it includes XFX is five-star
support which is world renowned at this
point it's a PCI Express 2.0 card it has
dual fans which is probably the reason
for the graphic that looks pretty sweet
on the front of the box here let's see
what else I've got to say for themselves
supports AMD eyefinity multi display
technology and E crossfire X multi GPU
technology and aim the accelerated
parallel processing technology this is
part of the AMD vision premium tier so
if you wanted to build an AMD vision
system then this would be part of a
premium so you could go select a premium
level processor and you would end up
with a reasonably well balanced system
that's the whole idea of AMD vision it's
a great idea alright we've got full
DirectX 11 support named bi affinity
which we mentioned before PCI Express 2
which we mentioned before 1080p full HD
which have bloody well better support
and the HD 3d technology which allows
you to view 3d blu-ray content as well
as play 3d games through your 8 up
through your 3d ready television using
the glasses from that provider
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 1.4 a which is
required for 3d 7.1 HD surround sound is
built into this card as well as gddr5
pretty much it
okay I don't know if I showed you guys
this yet but I have a Hello Kitty key
for my host now I love it I think it's
awesome cameraman got it for me there we
are
I've always liked how XFX boxes look
like a shoebox like it feels like I just
bought shoes I don't like shoes I got
new shoes today actually but they're
badminton shoes so I'm not wearing them
right now I'm actually just wearing my
socks and sandals which are a fashion
atrocity and I love it ok Pro Series PS
use so they've got a little catalog for
some of their other products which are
good five-year warranty something about
five-star support follow that's good
stuff North American limited warranty ok
so there's some fine print for you don't
forget XFX is warranty is actually here
hold on let me have a look at what they
have to say for themselves here what is
covered by this limited hardware
warranty what is not covered uh have a
state law apply what will XFX do may I
transfer ah maybe transfer to one owner
after the original owner pretty sweet
huh
most graphics card companies will not
let you transfer your warranty ok cool
next we have a quick install guide next
we have a driver CD an installation
guide don't use it ok finally we have
one of these awesome oh here's the
driver seat yeah that's just the
installed I'm one of these awesome door
hangers do not disturb on gaming and
like planes and stuff excellent everyone
likes planes these felt like planes on
it and this faster and better more
performance alright so here's my shoes I
mean graphics card because the 67 90
does not have a reference design that
means every 67 90 you purchase whether
it's XFX or any other brand will be a
non reference PCB so what that means in
XFX is cases because they're awesome
this matte black PCB which as you guys
may or may not know by this time I am a
huge huge fan of so it's all matte black
and awesome and looks great and here's
something I just noticed so it looks
like XFX does not want you to remove the
from this particular card you can see
there's little warranty void if removed
stickers on two of the screws on the
back so you cannot remove that there
heatsink without voiding that there
warranty so watch out for that guys pcie
2.0 connector on the bottom of the card
and that pretty much does it for what I
wanted to say there here you can see the
design of the cooler a little bit so we
got three heat pipes embedded in the
base and it looks like those are heat
pipe direct touch heat pipe so those
should perform pretty darn well we've
also got a fairly Wow
opposite of dents I'm like I'm feeling
dents right now because I can't remember
what the word is for that sparse comes
to mind but that's not really that's
something I would use to describe the
fins of a heat sink okay well a fairly
low resistance heat sink design rather
resistant to air flow so the spacing
between the fins is quite large which
means that these fans although they're
thin and are not going to be able to
generate a ton of static pressure should
be able to push a decent amount of
airflow through those and still remain
quiet okay so you can see that the heat
sink is solid here where those heat
pipes come through that's where the GPU
core is and then those heat pipes which
I showed you before come up here from
the top and are carrying the heat out to
the fins where they can be directly
cooled by these fans good stuff we have
two 6-pin power connectors although from
what I understand on the 67 90 it's
fairly debatable whether it actually
needs a second PCIe power connector
either way the card won't work unless
you plug in both but this is not a super
power hungry card so regardless of you
know how many connectors there are on it
don't worry too much about it you're not
going to be like you know going crazy on
your power bill just because you plug in
260 790 here at the back you can see
there's very little restriction in terms
of air flow low low restriction I could
have said that
okay very little restriction in terms of
air flow for air coming out the front of
the card alright so this is an internal
exhaust design you can see that fairly
clearly you're gonna kick a little bit
of heat out here where the XFX logo is
built into the PCI back plate at the
back but other than that most of the
exhaust is going to be in your case as I
said before this is not going to kick
out a ton of heat so I wouldn't worry
too much about installing
in your case and oh my CPU temps are
gonna go through the roof nah worry too
much about that here on the back of the
card we see our output connectors so
we've got two DVI one HDMI and two
DisplayPort that means this card
supports up to four displays in
eyefinity mode so two via DVI or HDMI so
you can use these two these two or these
two and then two more via mini
DisplayPort so thank you for checking
