for me to take the latest and greatest
graphics cards and compare them against
their peers or against their
predecessors in terms of their physical
stature so this is the very latest from
nvidia the gtx 580 so this is an msi
card this is a reference card so every
580 that is available immediately after
the launch of this GPU will be pretty
much exactly like this one okay so I'm
just giving you a start of a couple
views of the card here if you want to
see the whole thing in closer detail you
can always check out the unboxing so
we're going to do a length comparison
here and in order to facilitate that I'm
going to flip the cards over onto their
backs so we're going to compare it
against the gtx 480 which you may
already see some similarities with in
terms of the overall layout of the PCB
in fact there are some parts that are
quite clearly just not reused and I'm
like here looks pretty similar to here
and as a matter of fact the layout of
the RAM chips as well as the GPU is
quite quite similar as well so what
we're going to discover in just a moment
is that these cards happen to be this is
the 480 right now just over 10 and a
half inches in length each so we're
going to have a look at the gtx 580 and
it is exactly the same length now how
does this compare to the latest and
greatest from the red team bearing in
mind the date of this video so not that
I'm saying anything about the latest and
greatest from ati but this is the 5870
which is currently the latest and
greatest and it is just a hair over 11
inches itself with that frap Batmobile
shroud thing it's got going on like 11
and uh like in it whatever that is an
eighth of an inch or something like that
so that is the physical layout of these
cards in terms of connectors the gtx
lady has exactly the same connectors as
the gtx 480 so you can see that from the
back they look pretty much exactly the
same except that one has fingerprints
all over it from being used on various
test benches over and over and over
again and the other one is quite clean
because I'm just getting started with it
so thank you for checking out my length
comparison of the gtx 580 and the gtx
480 and don't forget to subscribe to
