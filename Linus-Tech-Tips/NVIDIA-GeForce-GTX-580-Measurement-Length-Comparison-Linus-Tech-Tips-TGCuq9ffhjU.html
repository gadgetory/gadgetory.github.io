for me to take the latest and greatest
graphics cards and compare them against
their peers or against their
predecessors in terms of their physical
stature so this is the very latest from
Nvidia the GTX 580 so this is an MSI
card this is a reference card so every
580 that is available immediately after
the launch of this GPU will be pretty
much exactly like this one okay so I'm
just giving you a certain about couple
views of the card here if you want to
see the whole thing in closer detail you
can always check out the unboxing so
we're going to do a length comparison
here and in order to facilitate that I'm
gonna flip the cards over onto their
backs so we're gonna compare it against
the GTX 480 which you may already see
some similarities with in terms of the
overall layout of the PCB in fact there
are some parts that are quite clearly
just reused you know like here looks
pretty similar to here and as a matter
of fact the layout of the RAM chips as
well as the GPU this is not quite quite
similar as well so what we're going to
discover in just a moment is that these
two cards happen to be this is the 480
right now just over ten and a half
inches in length each so we're gonna
have a look at the GTX 580 and it is
exactly the same length now how does
this compare to the latest and greatest
from the red team bearing in mind the
date of this video so not that I'm
saying anything about the latest and
greatest from ATI but this is the 58 70
which is currently the latest and
greatest and it is just a hair over 11
inches itself with that batmobile shroud
thing it's got going on like 11 and uh
like in it whatever that is an eighth of
an inch or something so that is the
physical layout of these cards in terms
of connectors the GTX
580 has exactly the same connectors as
the GTX 480 so you can see that from the
back they look pretty much exactly the
same except that one has fingerprints
all over it from being used on various
test benches over and over and over
again and the other one is quite clean
because I'm just getting started with it
so thank you for checking out my length
comparison of the GTX 580 and the GTX
480 and don't forget to subscribe to
