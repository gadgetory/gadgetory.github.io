like to go from iOS to Windows Phone 8
sort of blog I'm gonna start with just
some general feelings about the the HTC
8x so number one is it's absolutely
gorgeous the ergonomics it's very very
nice to hold I find that I'm actually
able to use it mostly one-handed if I
put my pinky here for support which I
find I do sort of need to do for the
it's just I guess it's more of a habit
than anything else I can still almost
reach sort of the the top tile here but
not quite as I'm more comfortable in the
bottom parts of the screen but I can
reach back and search and all that good
stuff if I had any complaints about the
phone it would be that the lock buttons
a little bit stiff compared to the
volume and the camera shutter buttons so
I will often be trying to get to the
lock button and I will accidentally
adjust the volume of the phone overall
though it's very very snappy games feel
a little bit a little bit stuttery
compared to what I'm used to on iOS but
I'd imagine there's probably some
optimisation coming for that at some
point you guys can check it out if you
want so I just installed Angry Birds and
I think one other ones so I mean it's
not it's nothing sort of super
objectionable or anything so you guys
can actually see how it's running so
it's not like running on one of those
those like USB media players or anything
like that like it's fine you know going
in and out of things is extremely
responsive i installed a cat piano app
so I was actually just kind of randomly
going through my iOS apps and seeing oh
yeah this is very similar to the one I
have already
yep so I was going through my iOS apps
and just sort of seeing what equivalent
stuff was available there's a lot of
stuff that isn't there's my Flixster
these are for these are just quick links
to the Google Mail accounts I have as
well as my hotmail I wish that it would
label them correctly I don't know if
that's the thing that you can change no
not so much but you can pin it over to
the Start menu here which is good which
is a good thing so slick gave me kind of
a look when when I said that it comes
with Nokia Maps but it's actually not
bad
you can sort a pan around and do
everything that you'd expect to do one
cool thing about the Maps app is you can
actually there's a way I actually don't
know how to do it yet but you can you
can download the maps so that you can
view it offline which is which is kind
of neat so you don't necessarily have to
use your data when you're out and about
so I thought that was kind of cool it
also comes with a flashlight app so this
is an HTC inclusion so you just press
the button four different flash levels
so I liked the medium one I think last
time I was playing around with it so
that's good I did find a replacement for
air video although it's not as good as
the one that I have so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys whatever what's
the point of even trying to hide
anything at this point
so my DVDs of Futurama that I owned and
ripped of course so play from the
beginning so this is this is pretty good
so I'm just playing this off of off of
my server it transcodes on the fly to
save on to save on data and to save on
on cpu-intensive nasaan this side so
give it a minute and that should start
playing the one thing I didn't like
about this versus our videos it's just
not as polished so when you leave off
somewhere and you exit the app to check
a text message or whatever else you go
back inside the app and no really it's
it's faster than this this is uh this
isn't right okay hold on let's try that
again
I've actually I've never seen it do that
before like I'm not trying to sell this
app by any stretch of the imagination
it's not as good as our video which is
the one that I like but it's not that
bad so here let's go look at something
else
so South Park or something which of
course I don't know the DVDs for and I
ripped them into this ok season six find
something there we go play from the
beginning so air video will resume your
playback from where you left off last
time it'll also do things like you can
check a text message and come back and
it remembers where you were with this
one if I go out momentarily and come
back
so you're resolving preparing you can
you can scrub pretty pretty easily err
it's not really scrubbing but you can
move around pretty easily so if I go out
and then I open the app again it has no
idea what was going on so there's no
resume it's nothing like that
preferences maybe no I don't know that
preferences sorry guys I know this is
going to be sort of a strange yeah
nothing like that there's gonna be sort
of a strange format a video for me but
this is just sort of my general thoughts
after the first day there's no HootSuite
app so I had to use a stock Twitter app
also there's a YouTube app that was
created by Microsoft so it's not quite
as it's not quite as smooth as as as an
actual YouTube app from Google Google
seems to be sort of not really that
interested in this platform in general
couple sort of microcephaly it's
Microsoft moments that I had when I
first got the phone was the keyboard
update so it came with a UK keyboard on
it and to get a new keyboard I had to I
had to go in here which was relatively
straightforward so so it's very
intuitive to use like I didn't really
have to think about any of this too much
so settings keyboard which is here and
then you know you just kind of hold on
things for contextual stuff actually
well you can't do that when there are
multiple ones but I added a keyboard it
was like a 20 mega load and I had to
reboot the phone though and I was like
yeah Microsoft that's how things work
you reboot
oh yeah there's there's not as much of
the 16 gigs left on the phone when you
first get it as I would like compared to
something like Android or iOS but my
personal music library is only around
five gigs and then I don't store much
other than videos or photos that I take
on the phone other than that so it
doesn't really bother me that much if
you guys want to see what else is in
setting
it's pretty straightforward you can add
as many accounts as you want which is
great and there's all my accounts so you
can add a buttload of accounts to it
which is kind of neat so you just throw
all your accounts in there and then
everything just kind of sinks and it's
very intuitive which I thought was great
Wi-Fi was simple tap and send as I guess
what they're calling NFC to do mobile
network not found I actually don't have
a sim in it right now because I haven't
quite managed to make the switch more on
that later backup cloud is good looking
for here oh yeah beats audio you can
turn on and off basically my experience
with this so far is it does make it
louder so it does enable the headphone
amp but the thing that I didn't like
about it is it sort of messes with the
EQ for me it's more of a it's more of a
flat EQ when you don't have Beats Audio
on by Beats Audio go figure it goes and
sort of amps up the bass to the point
where I found it kind of objectionable
so so that was that was something but
what was I talking about with the
keyboard something not as much of the 16
gigs left as I like I think caridy did
that oh yeah I'd had an update to apply
Servan on day one of me installing it
which I guess is sort of expected
depending on how long the phone's been
sitting in the box
oh yeah the camera experience is much
better than I'm used to so all you do is
press the camera the dedicated button
which is kind of nice and then you can
take pictures very very quickly so you
know if you want to focus on something
all that works about the way you'd
expect otherwise you can just take
pictures very quickly and what's neat is
that what you see in the viewfinder
doesn't necessarily indicate the quality
of the picture you're gonna get a lot of
the time you'll actually get something
see how that looks all yellowed out and
kind of ugly so if I actually take the
picture it looks way better than that
all the usual settings are there so
there's your flash your additional photo
settings things like white balance
saturation sharpness ISO face detection
all that good stuff video I recorded a
little bit of video and it looked pretty
good so far so I actually have not tried
to review pictures that I've taken on
the phone before so I guess that would
be photos there you go camera roll there
we go so you can check out what these
ones look like
see it's much sharper than what you were
actually seeing through the viewfinder
which i think is cool and then
presumably there's going to be some kind
of an easy way to share them or
something I don't know I haven't spent
like I said haven't had much time in
this so edit set his lock screen saver
to SkyDrive okay SkyDrive integrations
yet so far seems kind of neat going to
the market the market I thought the sort
of the navigation wasn't as intuitive as
I would have liked half the time I try
to do a store search like if I look for
Angry Birds you know like to me it would
be intuitive if I could press search to
do that but you want to do that
otherwise it takes you to like a Bing
search and then I don't know I guess I
just sort of found that a little bit
confusing yet you have to kind of figure
out what the tiles mean on your own so
it took me sort of a second to realize
that this wasn't text messages but is
actually the windows mail icon so I was
looking for text messages there but they
weren't there what else so this is a
cool thing to do with music now I did
mention that the music transferred oh no
I didn't mention that before you know
what this is just awesome this is
probably one of the biggest sort of
breaths of fresh air versus iOS that
I've encountered so far so if you look
at the computer there's a couple things
here so there's the welcome to home
welcome home to Windows Phone thing that
you can download
technically it's for Nokia Lumia phones
but it actually works with any Windows
Phone the only issue I had with this one
is that it didn't end up wanting to take
my contacts and calendar because my
contacts and calendar are like a total
mess like some of its synced on iCloud
some of it's in Google some of its in
hotmail and they're all just kind of in
there and just sort of doing their thing
so what I wanted was I wanted to take
that whole mishmash and just kind of
import it it looks like you can't really
do that they sort of freaked out and it
didn't want to copy all my music as well
probably some kind of a DRM thing so I
didn't find this one that useful yeah I
want to quit there's also the the
Windows Phone thing here which has some
general settings which is very very
basic stuff not a whole lot here and
Windows Phone move
is between your phone and PC Oh
apparently there is a wizard wizard plug
your phone to see what's on it
like it should be plugged into my home
oh yeah there it is
so you can do things like sync libraries
from like Windows Media Player and stuff
okay which leads me to what's like
probably the coolest thing about Windows
Phone check this out
drag and drop yeah I'll drag and drop
the music documents and pictures and not
worry about having stupid iTunes
installed on my computer or anything
like that cuz iTunes just crashes my
stuff all over the place loving it so
yeah I'm not gonna miss iTunes and
that's one thing that I really like just
sort of that ease of integration
drag-and-drop file copies that's the way
that things should work I love the
keyboard so here's a text that well I
had the sim in here's my texts so diesel
the keyboard doesn't feel leggy like an
Android keyboard does to me like you
click it and it feels like you're
clicking on it just like the just like
the iPhone keyboard the one thing that I
don't like about it is that it's a
little slow to get to underscore you
have to do this which i think is kind of
dumb and the spacings just different so
i've been using this phone at this width
and this height for two years which just
kind of means that it's just it's going
to take me a little while to get used to
this so I think that pretty much
concludes it so I haven't managed to
make the switch yet because I haven't
found a way to back up my SMS messages
and it sounds like talking to people
that that's just generally not going to
be possible and then it's the brakes for
switching from platform to platform but
I don't know I guess if I just have to
kind of take the plunge so yeah I'd my
day one of using Windows Phone I
actually haven't switched to it yet but
you know what should I just do it
tomorrow yeah I'm getting the nod from
slick just kind of just kind of go for
it I'm there's a lot of stuff I'm gonna
miss though all right well that's pretty
much it so subscribe flyness tech tips
from boxing's reviews and other computer
videos and hopefully tomorrow I have a
slightly different update for you but
that's my thoughts from day one with
Windows Phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
