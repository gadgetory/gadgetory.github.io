rampage 3 extreme but in a micro ATX
form factor ok that's it I'm done the
video I'm just gonna knock off for lunch
so thanks for watching and don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech didn't know
okay so the rampage 3 Jean this isn't it
LGA 1366 motherboard it supports cry 7
extreme core i7 processors on LGA 1366
it's SLI and CrossFireX ready it's
Windows 7 ready it has a bunch of a soos
Republic of gamers features including
ROG connect so that means you can hook
it up to another PC tweak a bunch of
hardware settings that way it has Pro
belt which is your voltage readout
points it has CPU level up which is a
one-button overclocking method which you
probably aren't going to be using if
you're buying a rampage board it has a
game first which is a land priority
excuse me land priority application so
you can actually set it so that your
incoming and outgoing packets are
prioritized to either games media
streaming VoIP or file-sharing and
you've got nice high-end onboard audio
which includes this Kaspersky antivirus
apparently as well so let's have a look
at the included bundle accessories first
and then we will have a look at the
board I really like the look of a
Seuss's rampage series boards these days
they look just amazing ok so the first
thing we've got is an i/o shield next we
have some cable ties for managing your
wires we've got an SLI bridge there
front panel connector software software
helper blocks so these enable you to
connect all your front panels buttons to
this and then plug the whole thing into
the board you've got a USB cable for the
ROG connect you've got one two three
actually I'm sorry there are two SATA 6
gigabits per second cables and then 6
SATA 3 gigabit per second cables then we
have the user's guide which includes a
driver DVD as don't use this as well as
a Republic of gamers sticker and some
labels for your SATA cables so that you
can see which one goes to which drive
very easily they have
one of these side window cakes sticker
things I don't think I've ever seen
anyone put one of those on the side of
their case before but there's a first
time for everything if you have one of
those on the side of your case please
take a video of your computer and set it
as a video response to this video I'm
sure that everyone would be interested
to see what your case looks like with
that thing on it all right here we go
so let's start in the middle we've got
our LGA 1366 socket and with what
appears to be eight phase power so that
means I mean that's about as good as it
gets for a micro ATX form factor you
have a lot less PCB to work with and
given that we're seeing so many
manufacturers moving towards larger than
ATX size boards you can imagine there's
a lot of electrical routing that needs
to go on with these high-end board
designs these days we've got six ddr3
slots and you can see that it's got the
clips on the one side and no clips on
the other side so these are those easy
insert style slots they support triple
channel memory here is the onboard
battery for the CMOS okay that stores
all your your BIOS settings so you take
that out it'll lose the BIOS settings
you got your 24-pin power and it's ideal
location on the right-hand edge and then
you've got an 8 pin power in it's ideal
location up at the top left you only
have to plug in 4 but I would recommend
using 8 especially if you're running any
overclocks
next you've got to say - 6 gigabit per
second ports as well as 6 SATA 2 3
gigabit per second ports here is the IR
og that's their their chip for all of
the Republic of gamers overclocking
features here's your South Bridge so
that's covered by a very cool-looking
heatsink and then the North Bridge is
also covered by similarly styled
heatsink I really like what assist is
doing with their heatsink designs where
they're going after practicality in
terms of putting fins and heat pipes and
everything on them but they also have a
very very different angular look to them
these days I really think it looks
pretty cool
and this is probably a more practical
design right here just the straight fins
with a heat pipe through it but that's
going to be doing a lot of the cooling
not only for the voltage to the arm for
the power delivery for the CPU but also
for the North Bridge because they are
connected by that heat pipe down at the
bottom of the board we have one PCI slot
which is probably one to many for a
board like this but lots of people still
do have
PCI peripherals that they need to plug
in we've also got two PCIe 16x slots
these will run at full 16x and then we
have one PCIe 4x slots so if you're
using two dual slot graphics cards you
will not be able to install any
additional cards in this motherboard
it's just a limitation of micro ATX
we've got on board start and reset
buttons as well as a couple of USB 2.0
front panel headers as well as a
firewire front panel header moving
around to here we have the back panel
connections so we have our ps2 keyboard
port we have one two three four five six
USB 2.0 ports a CMOS Clear button and
it's absolutely ideal my favoritest
place on the back panel of the
motherboard we have optical audio out
firewire Gigabit Ethernet rog connect
button and port two USB 3.0 ports and
what appeared to be gold-plated 7.1
audio ports thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the assuit
