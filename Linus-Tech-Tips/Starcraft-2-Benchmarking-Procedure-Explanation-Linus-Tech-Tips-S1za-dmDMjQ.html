instructional guide so this will allow
you to benchmark Starcraft 2 just like
us so it should be noted first of all
that we use the ultra and extreme
presets we benchmark at 1080p with no
anti-aliasing and slick is going to walk
you through there's links in the
description for anything any additional
instructions you might need but slick is
gonna walk you guys through from the
entry screen through to the several
minute benchmark that we run in
Starcraft 2 now there's a reason that we
run it the way we do with but ton of
Units and all these particle effects and
like sort of this intense battle and
that's because Starcraft 2 for the most
part runs on pretty much anything so in
order to actually give you guys some
idea in the most intense possible
scenario in the middle of a battle when
your graphics card or your CPU might
actually tank and lower your framerate
giving you not that smooth performance
you need in order to you know click on
things accurately and in order to react
to things in time we wanted to show you
the worst case scenario so guys the idea
is you can follow along with this
benchmark your own system and you can
easily compare it to how our reference
systems perform in this game so you can
decide if you need to upgrade or not I'm
just going to do a quick recap of our
settings so running full screen 1080p
running the ultra preset and the extreme
preset with no idea lazy how you find
the game it's just jump into arcade real
quick go to micro 3 jump in you I've
highly recommend bookmarking it book
where button is just right up here just
play a game pretty straightforward and
start game
so we're gonna start off right away by
spawning 50 freakin zealots just because
that sounds awesome
there we go then jump into Terran spawn
30 men of X because no one should die on
this day jump back to Protoss and click
it again as you can see on the tooltip
press again to show upgrades we're gonna
give the zealots armor armor 3 and we're
gonna give the zealots shields 3 so
they're all tanky as possible mirror the
whole setup over jump onto the other
side and give them upgrades as well do
shields 3 and over 3 yet again save this
preset as whatever you want just because
it's a lot easier this way
I can spell a lot easier this way if you
ever have to run the benchmark again
that way say you came in with a clean
slate you cleared the board you could
just load and it would bring everything
back so instead of precisely spawning a
monstrously ridiculous amount of Units
again it's just all there right away
your upgrades are saved everything it's
pretty awesome so now you just want to
start which doesn't actually start the
match it'll properly set your screen
right in the position it should be in
and it puts you into kind of the battle
UI so you can see over here just pause
reset attack energy audience stuff all
you want to do for the pregame is throw
energy on just gives all your medevacs
full energy so that while they're
healing everybody up they won't run out
and then you just start your benchmark
right when you click attack
yes the unit composition is totally
unrealistic and this would probably
never happen but that's not exactly the
point it's just there's a lot of Units
on-screen there's a whole bunch of
particle effects from the different
medevacs and light kind of stuff so it's
just lots of stuff on the screen which
is pretty hard on the computer we find
that a lot of star kept benchmarks are
too easy too much base building stuff
like that which isn't actually very hard
on the computer so we thought we throw
something a little bit harder now this
isn't as hard as it gets we're not
throwing motherships poking everything
and all that other kind of stuff at it
but this is still pretty difficult
Facebook I hope you found this
educational click the link in the
description to visit our forum so you
can post your own results and see how it
compares to anything that we've pretty
much ever tested in the past and as
always guys thanks for watching and
