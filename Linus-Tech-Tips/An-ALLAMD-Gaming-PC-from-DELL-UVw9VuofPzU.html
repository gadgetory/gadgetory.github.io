finally after four long years AMD is
able to challenge Intel once again but
the launch of Rison was less baby bottom
smooth and more team that meant well but
still managed to bend the Civic into a
hedge PC enthusiasts were willing to
trust that AMD would iron out the
wrinkles in short order but Rison wasn't
quite ready for the average consumer you
know folks who think when a computer
fails to post it means that it got lost
in the mail but good news everyone the
unruly teen has grown up a donned a suit
and gotten a job Rison is now available
in Dells
gee skills km 780 our mechanical
keyboard features a brushed aluminum top
plate on the fly Mac for recording and
various Cherry MX key switch
configurations learn more at the link
below now you can say what you want
about your past experiences with Dell
but the fact is they validate their
computers in a different way than
individual component manufacturers for
instance when a soos makes a motherboard
that is compatible with Rison you can
trust that the motherboard will be good
but they only validate the motherboard
not every possible graphics card SSD RAM
stick etc that you could possibly stick
in it what Dell sells is the experience
as a whole now you might be sitting
there thinking well that's nice but I'm
just gonna build my own system anyway
but consider this Dell the third largest
om PC producer in the world sold more
than ten times as many systems as AMD
sold graphics cards last year and when
you consider that you'll understand why
complete system sales is the way forward
for AMD to win back some real market
share from Team Blue but only if that
complete experience is any good so is it
actually it's not bad I'm not a hundred
percent sold on the looks the blue
venting on the side is a slightly weird
contrast with the boring business
aesthetic of the rest of the case but I
wouldn't call it offensive
especially because functionally it's
pretty darn good front i/o is ample with
type a USB 2 and USB 3 including a quick
charge port for your phone or tablet and
a fifth USB of the type C variety even
the SD card reader is high-speed which
is a nice touch
and at the back you'll find everything
you need for a bunch of peripherals or
VR gear and analog surround speaker
setup and even your model M keyboard and
ball mouse if you're into that sort of
thing also the plastic removing
experience was one of the best we've had
in a long time
moving inside then our build out of the
inspiron gaming fifty 675 includes a
hard drive with no SSD so the OS is
about as responsive and sprightly as my
nan but the good news there is that the
motherboard is surprisingly fully
featured so upgrading down the line is a
legitimate option it's a shorter m80
export and only two memory slots is a
bit of a downer but it's got dual PCI
Express 16x slots with adequate spacing
and support for crossfire with a third
card in between it rocks to m dot two
slots and a whole whack of SATA ports
for all the storage you could reasonably
expect to fit in a mid Tower especially
if you're willing to get a little
creative about Drive mounting and thanks
to the am 4 socket our Rison v 1400
could be replaced with a 1700 X or more
giving us up to twice the core count or
even potentially better CPUs in the
future depending on AMD and Dell support
of this socket moving forward so the
functionality is good but if we're being
honest I think Dell could do better when
it comes to cable management the overall
layout is much better than older Dell
systems that I've had the misfortune of
upgrading including some nice touches
like room for a much larger power supply
standard ATX to boot if the included 4
60 watt one isn't enough along with
adequate space for full length graphics
cards and even a holder for the back of
the graphics card to prevent that smelly
guy 2 seats down at a LAN party from
stealing it or actually on second
thought it probably has more to do with
those guys in the brown shorts gaming
wise it's about perfectly Specht out for
1080p 60 FPS gaming performing admirably
and everything that we threw at it it's
certainly vr capable and managed a solid
60 frames per second in modern triple-a
titles on high slightly older triple-a
games can even get the ultra treatment
and if you're only playing
eSports titles you could even consider
an investment into a high refresh rate
display the only issue we had was
occasional stuttering when 3d assets
loaded in late thanks to the molasses
speed hard drive broom broom so again
get an SSD under full load the CPU
stayed suspiciously cool at less than 40
degrees so I do wonder if Dell is
reading the temperature offset correctly
about 60 would make more sense with this
cooling solution and as for the GPU it
ran a little hotter than we'd like over
80 degrees but this is more the fault of
AMD's underwhelming reference cooler
design since it's sitting right beside
an open air vent the single exhaust fan
is unexceptional but adequately handled
our single graphics card configuration
and features anti-vibration mounts and
overall the Inspiron gaming wasn't
distracting on the desk and was almost
inaudible when we placed it on the floor
though with that said cleaning will be
important for keeping thermals and
acoustics consistent over time because
with no dust filters and a lot of
openings it's not gonna take long to
grow fur in a carpeted room but besides
gaming what can it be used for with only
8 gigs of ram ah not that much but with
another stick it would be suitable for
applications like photo editing or light
video editing and most other general
productivity tasks value eyes I've got
to give full marks to both Dell and AMD
the cost to build an equivalent system
even using non-mining craze prices for
the RX 580 lost nine hundred and fifteen
bucks and ours came in at nine hundred
and fifty you lose out on some
enthusiasts stuff like better
overclocking support but for folks who
weren't gonna do that anyway $35 is a
pretty compelling value for a functional
if kind of crappy keyboard and mouse
assembly service and a full system
warranty so our hope is that Dell can
pop out heaps of these systems so that
AMD gets the cash flow going to continue
improving Rison and continue stirring up
the processor market well hey there
can't
it's um - and I'm here to tell you about
