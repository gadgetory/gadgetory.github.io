hardware enthusiast
Rison is right around the corner Vega is
on the way and we are here right now at
the nvidia gtx 980ti launch Nvidia
claims this is the biggest improvement
from its ti series launch ever and that
makes sense because the 1080 and the
1080p I have almost nothing in common at
all
they aren't based on the same GPU they
aren't running the same memory bus with
I mean the TI even has two power
connectors to the standard 1080 s1 this
is an exciting but probably really
expensive day let's run through all of
the things that we know about in videos
new flagship
the new master keys proem RGB and pro s
white from coolermaster are coming soon
check out their current lineup at the
link below
first off let's dive into the specs as
you might have expected this card is a
lot closer to the Titan XP than it is to
a standard GTX 1080
but even then it's not that close it has
the same GP 102 core and it shows the
same amount of CUDA cores at 3584 the
same 12 billion transistors and 224
texture units with the same TDP of 250
watt but then the clock speed is
slightly higher at 1600 megahertz for
boost and there are a few less roughs at
88 instead of 96 there are also changes
in terms of Io Nvidia removed the DVI
connector and replace it with nothing
that's right folks NVIDIA has abandoned
DVI and left the user with three display
ports and one HDMI port for your
convenience they have included a
DisplayPort to DVI adapter in the box
however so you've got that going for you
which is nice but moving on regardless
we've got the memory setup which is also
a little bit odd you've got 11 gigs of
gddr5 XV RAM running at 11 gigabit per
second they've accomplished this through
channel optimization equalization
techniques and having minimal noise but
that my friends is not the whole story
for memory they've also implemented
tiled caching which should improve cache
locality and reduce memory traffic
overall by better utilizing their l2
cache then there's the new thermal
design with vapor chamber cooling and 2x
the cooling area as I'm assuming the
1080 as they didn't actually specify
this is not the same cooler as the Titan
XP and they promised increased
performance over that as well
the benchmarks that they gave us put a
1080 running at higher than normal TDP
and well above the standard max
temperature spec Nvidia usually set
against the 1080 Ti that was running
below its TDP and again at a higher than
normal temperature so I guess we'll wait
till we get it back in the office to
really judge it there they also have a
new seven phase power delivery setup
which is all dual sets which should help
it be more power efficient than all
other Pascal cards in their lineup then
it got juicy they showed us performance
numbers
and they were pretty damn impressive
compared to a 1080 they're claiming that
it's about 35% faster when compared to
other 1080 launches like 900 series in
700 series they were 25 and 18
respectively also just as a note
Sounders edition cards will be the first
ones available directly from Nvidia and
then will be priced right at MSRP they
also announced a bunch of stuff on the
software side of things but most of it
is for developers like shadow play and
angel' having their own public SDKs so
the developers can implement them into
their games at will and something called
Nvidia aftermath that gives game
developers the ability to classify GPU
crashes by location and type if the user
has elected to upload those files then
there is my personal favorite FCAT VR
which is related to standard FCAT but
obviously tunes for VR it has run time
frames rendered frames and software
capture indicators in three different
locations on the screen then you just
open the CSV files that it outputs in
there FCAT data analyzer and you've got
a relatively easy to use an accurate way
to benchmark PR which is awesome because
we have not had that until now
Squarespace because you need to build a
website you really want 24/7 live chat
and email support and you want to pay
like somewhere around 12 bucks a month
and you want to buy it for a year and
when you buy it for a year you want to
get a free domain included you want to
look fine on everything someone's going
to view the website on a watch tablet a
phone a console a desktop whatever you
want to be able to sell things through
your website you want to have the
potential to have one singular page that
just looks wonderful all the time and
you want to be able to publish your
Apple news format stuff directly to
Squarespace through their included
module well you can do all of that go to
Squarespace are calming use offer code
LPT to get 10% off of your first
purchase because you also wanted a
discount and then they flat-out refused
to tell us the MSRP or when the card
would be released so we have to watch
the live stream just like you guys do to
get that information and then once I
have that information
we will finish up this video in terms of
filming we will import it all to the
computer edit it render it and upload it
to YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
