supplies are optimized for silent
operation click now to learn more
so here's day two of the event where
Chris is making the argument that it's
not the size that counts it's what you
do with it right it's something that
small people say has a fellow small
person who doesn't happen to be very
tall I I'm with you on this but yeah
these computers that we have in our hand
are doing everything we need them to do
we're just getting information out there
right that's what everybody else is
doing except that our batteries are
probably going to last longer
it looks pretty bird your laptop because
in the video if you decide to smack-talk
me you were seriously gonna work on an
iPhone I said are you seriously okay now
if you're gonna make if you're gonna
make the argument that size doesn't
matter would you actually fight him if
you want so basically because the the
stream hasn't started yet we're all just
kind of sitting around trolling taking
pictures of each other Kim can I see
that picture
don't worry I have I have an actual leg
zoom that doesn't suck because I don't
have a DSLR so I can't focus on it
though because I don't have a DSLR so
we're about 15 minutes late but we're
still pretty excited to see what we're
gonna see here I just means that I have
now had all of that water so it is time
for a bathroom break and be a
presentation I've even started yet so I
water yeah it's yeah it's 9:00 in the
morning what's wrong with you nothing
you feeling great right come on Waianae
I mean livestream we use oh hi I was
just disgusted with my colleagues right
here - you mean the difficulties of
livestream I guess all right all right
the thing I gotta say really want to be
in your video - to shave sir - to shake
no you're you're in the video that I
have to look at sitting in my room
uploading right now yeah the video that
I took of you while you were
don't worry you look great
musics a favor we're starting ladies and
gentlemen please welcome corporate vice
president global communications for AMD
Alan Taylor exciting I hope you guys are
tuned in live because I'm not gonna
videotape this whole thing since there's
a live stream so yeah good morning
Aloha so if you guys have never seen me
fangirl out before then about to have
Nanoha
on a new level here so behind me right
there is chris roberts the mind behind
wing commander
and the upcoming star citizen which you
guys have probably heard enough about a
fair bit
I've pre-ordered my my constellation
ship there's 250 bucks which is
definitely more than I've spent on all
other games combined in about the last
five years so that's how stoked I am on
this so I'm just kind of waiting for an
offer
young candy here and shake his hand
which is which is about all I'm going
for I can see Charlie over there is
going going for the business card okay I
guess I could I just wanted to say hi I
love it here can you get the wrong video
sure I watched you at Texas occasionally
on Oak listen it's like really yeah yeah
well never I'm trying to figure out what
the best cooler or something today hey
you guys well I appreciate that thank
you very much so we're definitely we're
definitely fangirling out as much as we
as much as we ever have I mean what I
said a minute ago that you probably
didn't hear well as I pledged two
hundred and fifty bucks to star citizen
thank you more than I've spent on every
other game combined of my entire library
probably about last five years well
thank you cuz you're letting us make the
game without having any publisher or UC
or anyone that's just that's actually
what I tell everyone it's like it's like
it's a really cool thing to develop a
game and not worry about anything but
making the best game not worrying about
pleasing the mocking department the only
be worried about is people are gonna
play the game yeah very excited just
checked out the hangar module and I'm
we're actually gonna be publishing a
video very shortly we know it's totally
irrelevant but we're taking a bunch of
graphics cards we're doing sometimes box
what kind of okay how hard is this gonna
push it and it's pushing it pretty hard
oh no it's just not very optimized we
don't do any LEDs and we were I wasn't
joking when I say
and I was 18 million Polly's are like on
the because we haven't got any LEDs so
like the constellations a million for
the freelances million three even the
small ones a 300,000 then you got that
big impairment and we found something
have like it's it's totally not there
yet but it's so exciting to be able to
see it no it's awesome I'm actually
ready yet I'm enjoying the process of
people playing and checking out and then
you actually sort of see feedback it's
like a great feedback way right so it's
like in my old days when I used to make
games I'd have a team in like a lot of
time okay well give this to this and I'd
like open up for debate just because I'd
like to have a discussion and then I
helped me make my mind for what I was
going to do and so that's kind of when I
view how many 250,000 bankers you just
have a much bigger debate pool except I
mean the key difference between the back
are giving you feedback in an employee
giving you feedback is you pay the
employees which is like it's terrifying
to me yeah it's fine no you know what I
actually have said this before like when
we've done yeah like I'd be out the
farms or whatever is I don't mind people
having negative AMP is honestly
constructive in doing it because it
shows investment right so you really
care like people care they're like so
they don't like something like I want
this to be fixed because they care it's
not because they're just being you know
a troll or something because they they
sort away and they want a chance
sometimes they have valid points well
they put their money up front so it's
one of those things where no one's gonna
pay money just to go call someone yeah
yeah no no no so nice I think our
community's gross yeah sure sure
absolutely no no no because I can never
be embarrassed about sitting by myself
at an empty table ever again because I
introduced myself to chris Roberts
the star citizen guy
over there I was going to say and he
knew who I was already which was like he
like watches my videos how this is like
how I'm gonna change my okay like go my
whole deck where you live in here and
they know I got sure I can do that
everywhere you go so so basically so
basically I had Austin holding the
camera just kind of push it because just
like the moment when I mean it's not
like he was like dude the look on your
face it was like dude the look on your
face when he like knew who you were it's
like I was blown away
well I saw you during most of the
presentation that I gave you Johnny
like I was dropping my food in my
fortune my chocolate did you ever play
no I was not aiming at
like but I found out that that game was
just like so I found out about beds and
I was just like yeah I'm gonna shoot
so my plan is to have like this before
men check so
so I've been asked very nicely by by
Chris and the and the you know I would
even I'm sorry I don't know what your
actual company is called I just know
about it space industry Imperium okay so
I've been asked to finish building the
PC for the head of marketing of cloud
Imperium so apparent and that III we've
already been through this that is gonna
be extremely challenging because he has
a great PC that he actually built
himself and you guys can check out the
blog post I where was that posted it was
it if you search for chris Roberts
personal rig I think yeah you'll find it
ah do I like the motherboard okay so you
gotta crosshair five formula Z okay yeah
that's about as good as it gets for any
I haven't seen this idea on their memory
before so I've only seen the older
spreader that doesn't have the sort of
textured look on the side here what else
what you got in here so this is their
ninety five ninety so once again that is
about as high-end as it gets for an AMD
CPU so that's a five gigahertz eight
core what else you got in here yeah I
was gonna say I think that's about to
get awkward cuz now my understanding is
there was a bit of a miss configuration
with the machine I have I think you guys
had a two hundred and eighty millimeter
cooler or something like that there's no
mounting points in this particular case
for that can I help you move that here
let me turn this off a bit of a thing
going on here where we can't find the
motherboard screws for the system that
I'm supposed to be helping build for
yeah
so that's that trig note note they're
definitely not under the board oh no I
would have thought of that and they're
okay but what we do have is the graphics
card that's gonna be going in this
system which is about as exciting as any
screw could possibly be there we go so
we can get actually a pretty good look
at it here so we've got what looks like
a metal Yoona sink that's probably
covering presumably memory and vrm and
gonna help dissipate a little bit of
heat you can see it actually wraps
around the back here
AMD's done their usual thing where they
kind of have a very small penis
extension on the PCB so the card is a
little bit longer than it otherwise
would be but not too nearly the same
degree is what NVIDIA has done with the
last couple of generations of graphics
cards or they've got like these weird
like things that seem to be designed to
make them not fit in cases really need
ID on the front of it
these actually illuminate so I've seen a
couple of them running so far so that's
that's a really cool that's a really
cool look for it
here on the back we've got DisplayPort
HDMI and this is an interesting thing so
I don't know if this was in the embargo
session or not the embargo session
because they didn't talk about it at all
but you can see there's no analog pins
on these DVI connectors so these are not
capable of being adapted with a DVI to
VGA adapter it actually physically won't
fit and the signaling is not there so
you gonna find the screws did we these
are these are the motherboard screws but
first you need to put the liquid that's
only eight these came with the liquid
cooler I can tell because they're
color-coded okay then let's I mean they
might they might fit it depends if they
have a coarse or fine
threading on there okay yes okay well we
could we could use them and then we
could figure out another way to mount
the cooler but that wouldn't help us
mount the SSD we still won't be able to
oh these could work for the SSD okay
what else do we have
okay well we do want let's see how far
we get here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
