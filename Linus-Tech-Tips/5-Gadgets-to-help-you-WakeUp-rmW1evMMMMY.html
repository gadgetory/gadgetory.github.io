big personality in a small package type
of character but believe it or not I'm
not actually this wired 24 hours a day
the real reason that employees at linus
media group are allowed to roll in
anywhere between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m.
every day is that I am NOT a morning
person but it's 2017 why struggle in the
morning like some kind of neanderthal
when technology can help you wake up
like a god
so here's five weird gadgets to help you
get yo ass out of bed in the morning and
here's a message from our sponsor
Sennheiser for helping us make this
video their new HD one Wireless in ears
feature a sleek design great sound
performance Bluetooth 4.1 apdex
and take anywhere mobility check them
out at the link below
I'm basically in an abusive relationship
with the snooze button in exchange for
my gentle sometimes less gentle caress
it gives me more time away from the
tedium of reality I know that I'm
suffering in the long term by not just
getting up but the call of the void is
just so alluring but what if there was
no snooze
well the Ruggie is an alarm clock that's
more like a bath mat when your alarm
goes off it rings and rings and rings
until you actually get out of bed and
stand on the mat by default you have to
stand on the ruggy for three seconds for
it to turn off but if you think you're
the kind of person who's liable to you
know just roll back into bed and close
your eyes again or scroll on your phone
instead of actually getting up you can
use the rug ease included software to
increase the standing time to up to
thirty seconds and if you step off of it
the time resets you can also upload an
mp3 that will play after the alarm
though I'm not sure why you can't just
change the alarm sound and the Ruggie
website has a bunch of inspiring
affirmations to choose from my personal
favorite is I acknowledge my own
self-worth and my confidence is soaring
and there are some intentionally funny
ones too like the I need to kick some
ice come on you can do it do it now and
have a wonderful day but realistically I
would definitely find a way around that
one I need something a little more
unpredictable meet everyone's favorite
self driving do disturber clucky
now clock he actually does have a snooze
button but you're only allowed to press
it once before he drives himself off
your nightstand and peels off down the
hall this lovable rabble-rousers
guaranteed to get you up and atom and
scare the ever-loving piss out of your
pets
he comes in a bunch of fun colors James
chose the more expensive chrome version
just to screw with me but you can get
whatever works for you
setup is about as easy as could be with
intuitively labeled buttons and you can
even turn off clock keys driving action
by simply poking him in the eye the only
drag is that he requires four sold
separately triple-a batteries and for 40
dollars for a clock on wheels I
personally appreciate a rechargeable
lithium-ion inside maybe with a magnetic
charging cable so that he can still be
free to hit the open road so I'm looking
forward to a v2 but clucky's morning
shenanigans are also easily countered so
maybe you're one of those weird cold
shower types looking for the most
hardcore possible wakeup solution maybe
you want an alarm clock that actually
electrifies you yes my friends the
padlock shock clock delivers an
electrifying jolt to your body so you
will literally jump out of bed the idea
is that the watch's beeps vibes and yes
shocks will give you an
adrenaline-fueled start to your day
and actually the pavlok can also be used
to break or form habits so pressing on
the watch will deliver from 1 to 5
shocks of an intensity of your choosing
the highest setting is a boat is painful
by the way as the $130 price tag so
theoretically the idea here is that you
can use it to condition yourself to
associate your cravings for sugar or
your nasty thoughts about your coworkers
with a short sharp zap that are you
pavlok recommends that you set aside 5
minutes per day to shock yourself while
you perform your bad habit for 5 to 10
days or some of them can actually even
be automated
thanks to integration with if this than
that so you can get shocked whenever you
buy stuff you don't need on Amazon use
social media or hell every 30 minutes
just because and if you're a nail biter
or a compulsive finger sniffer you can
actually even program it to shock you
whenever you move your hand up to your
face moving on to something a little
less masochistic the Philips wakeup
light is probably the most civilized
item on our list
gently rousing you from slumber by
simulating the Rising Sun over a twenty
to forty minute period depending on your
preference the light gradually changes
color from red to yellow becoming
brighter and even playing some gentle
nature sounds as it reaches your wakeup
time the idea is that the bulbs light
will signal your body to begin
suppressing melatonin the hormone
responsible for regulating sleep and
wakefulness so that you'll wake up in
the morning feeling more like a
professional youtuber and less like his
evil twin sour pants Mik Grogg face the
lights got a well-organised touch
interface you can snooze your alarm by
touching anywhere on the surface and get
this you can even use it as a lamp
brilliant literally and you can also use
it backwards simulating sunset to help
you unwind at the end of the day now 135
dollars might sound a little steep but
if you live in a part of the country
where raw turns his back on you for nine
months out of the year the wake up light
is also supposed to help fight seasonal
affective disorder
I just wish it's clean look wasn't upset
by the non-removable
FM antenna bringing us finally to number
five if you guys are anything like me
you spent your entire childhood as well
as an unhealthy portion of your
adolescence dreaming of being woken up
by a giant Rube Goldberg machine like
some kind of kooky inventor well for
adults with floor space disposable
income and
no chance of having any visitors dreams
can come true
I don't what the hell what's wrong with
you yeah obviously that didn't work at
all we just saw this thing on Amazon and
wanted to buy it it's not an alarm clock
and you know what else isn't an alarm
clock
