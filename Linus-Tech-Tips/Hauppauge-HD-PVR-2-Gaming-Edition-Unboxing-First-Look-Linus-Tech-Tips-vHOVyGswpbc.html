the apostate DP VR tube this is the
gaming edition and now includes some
pretty significant benefits over the
previous HD PVR so for one thing you've
got zero delay HDMI pass-through which
is pretty freakin awesome because
especially if you're using it for game
streaming or game commentating or
anything like that
you can't have any kind of an extra
delay or leg added by a device that
you're using to record video because
then how are you going to actually play
properly
okay so instructions here it's pretty
straightforward to open pull sides nope
oh there we go then it comes apart a
little something like this so this looks
upon initial inspection like a very
complete package of things that are
included so let's open up the box itself
really quick here and just have it okay
the size is a little bit or the
dimensions are a little bit weird makes
it look kind of like futuristic and UFO
II if you fo E is a word so the first
thing we find inside is a USB cable this
is USB a to be there you go very very
supple cable so very soft very nice
alright I'm just gonna put garbage in
there as we go the next thing we find
inside appears to be a power brick
alright power brick nope nope that goes
there that goes there next we've got a
component breakout so this will be handy
if you do have any HD devices that are
not digital so here we've got RGB and
then stereo audio connectors and then
those go to a proprietary connector that
plugs into the presumably back of the
Hapuna t' although i don't see where
that goes no this is for Xbox oh yeah
okay so they've included an Xbox
connector which will do something
supposedly will be back and it's a ps3
cable and the reason I couldn't figure
out what the heck it did was because
there's an additional cable
that you actually need to do anything
with it so this is also an RGB and
stereo audio cable that actually does
plug into this so if you did need to go
from ps3 out to component for whatever
reason then you could do this to go into
there we go the HD PVR
and then you can go out via HDMI so yeah
then we've got two more HDMI cables as
well as their their software that's
included so you should download the
latest off of the apology website and
I'm just going to clean things up a
little bit and we will be back in a
moment to show you the unit itself a
pause actually includes some notes that
we should probably talk about very
briefly so because ps3 does not allow
recording over the HDMI output you have
to use the component that's why it has
these adapters you have to use component
out to record from ps3 however it should
be noted that this connector with the
current firmware might be a little bit
sensitive to vibrations so just put the
PVR to somewhere where it's not going to
be sort of knocked around I mean that
that should be common sense anyway they
say they got a lot of calls about it
come on but come on guys you don't bump
an analogue connection while it's
connected and then expect it to work a
hundred percent so just yeah just plain
don't do that also make sure you put it
in the right way they say says they got
a lot of calls about that I don't know
why because it was pretty obvious to me
that it doesn't go in this way so you
turn it around and there you go
it's plugged in push down get it the
pushes down when you push push down
don't worry about it if you're using
with an ATI graphics card Andy Radeon
graphics card then you might have issues
with the latest drivers so just turn off
hardware acceleration these are their
tips and tricks that's nice of them to
include that on a little you know piece
of paper that they pack at the last
minute make sure that some of these
frequently asked questions are addressed
before people have to you know pick up a
phone and talk to a human being and
figure out how to use the product
because I don't want to like bother with
that when I buy something new I want it
to just work so the top of the unit has
a gorgeous brushed aluminum finish it
looks like actual aluminum yep it is
so make sure you don't touch it too much
or leave fingerprint stains on it
because it'll look pretty sweet as long
as you don't do that power button is
here on the top and then it's got sort
of
a great rim that goes around the entire
outside of it the bottom is full of
ventilation holes so there's a heat sink
right there that you can clearly see
through the perforations I hope you can
see it I can see it so I'll have to take
my word for it trust me it's there and
then the ventilation goes in the bottom
and out the back it looks like it
doesn't need a ton of cooling though
because these feet are quite low profile
so once you put this down there's not
going to be room for a ton of airflow to
be coming in and out of the unit so I
wouldn't put this on top of something
like an AV receiver for example I'd want
to put it on something that doesn't
exhaust heat because you don't want to
be using what are cooling holes to heat
the unit up just something to think
about so in terms of setup it's pretty
straightforward there's a number of
different ways you can hook it up and
they actually have diagrams in the in
the included QuickStart guide that make
it pretty simple but here's your power
in six volts DC in you have a USB
connector to go out to a PC laptop or
desktop there's that component in that
uses this sort of weird harness to
connect to it I would have preferred if
they just had I guess yeah it would take
up a lot of space on the back to have
all the component connectors but okay
HDMI IN HDMI out so that can be used for
recording a PC for recording an Xbox 360
or anything else that isn't HDCP
protected that's why they have to go
with that analog signal from the
PlayStation 3 so we'll have a look at
some of the different ways you can hook
it up so here's what the PlayStation 3
you're using that weird component in
thing USB out to a computer and then
HDMI HDMI out to a TV so this is for
streaming and then next we've got so
game console here I guess ok not sure
what their point is here so let's go
with this one Xbox 360 HDMI IN HDMI out
USB out to a laptop or desktop PC and
then out to a TV so the idea is that the
HDMI is a leg free pass through and then
USB is where you're actually recording
so that you can upload to something like
- something like YouTube or you can
stream using xsplit or whatever else the
case may be I don't know if you guys are
I don't know if you guys know this but
there is a huge thing going on with game
streaming and game commentary where
people are doing sort of like a webcam
view
selves they're sitting there playing a
game they're talking about it while they
play or I mean a lot of these guys are
basically just vloggers so they're
playing a video game but they're
actually talking about something totally
unrelated just so you have something to
watch and something to listen to at the
same time and they're not actually
necessarily the same thing as each other
so what is this for it's for if you
don't want to hook up an entire separate
computer with a dedicated capture card
in order to do like a cot like we had we
had a setup we did before with the
AVerMedia live gamer HD where we
actually had a computer that was set up
to do the capture and streaming so this
is if you just want to run a little box
like this to hook that up instead of
running it through a computer directly
so thank you for checking out this
unboxing online as tech tips don't
forget to subscribe for more buck scenes
reviews and other computer videos I was
asked what's the point of this if you
have to have a PC anyway and compared to
having like a dedicated PCI Express
capture card well the point is you can
use a laptop because it's using h.264
encoding and it does have a hardware
encoder inside here it means that just
using that USB to connection it can
stream as much data as it needs to in
order to record a high quality 1080p
30fps video that you can then do
whatever you want with after the fact it
should also be noted that I actually
made a mistake when I was unboxing this
this is the record button so that you
can press record and be sort of ready at
a moment's notice to record or not
record something not a power button
which it's just sort of on all the time
once it's plugged in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
