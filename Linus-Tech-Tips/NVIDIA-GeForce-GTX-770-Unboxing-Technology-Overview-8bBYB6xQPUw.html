Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more welcome to my unboxing and
first look at something where am I just
trolling you guys this is no no don't
worry what's actually in here is not an
8800 GT this is the geforce gtx 770 from
nvidia so this is a new generation
product a 700 series product but what
you'll notice is it actually shares a
lot in common with the last generation
gtx 680 so it has the same GK 104 core
so that is it to say that it has a
256-bit memory bus the stock card has
two gigs of ram but there are
non-reference cards that are going to be
available with up to 4 gigs of ram
however the ram is where the really
special part of this video card really
comes into play because this is the
first graphics card on earth to ship
with 7 gigahertz gddr5 what that means
is more memory bandwidth and we've
actually already done a fair bit of
testing on this card so what i can tell
you right now is that yeah the higher
clock speeds versus the gtx 680 yeah
this is a 70 class card that is pretty
much a replacement for the last
generation flagship gtx 680 except that
it's actually even faster so yeah it's
got higher clock speeds but particularly
at higher resolutions so greater than
1080p that extra memory bandwidth helps
a lot for it to really pull ahead of the
gtx 680 it also supports some other new
cool 700 series features such as GPU
boost 2 so GPU boost 2 allows this card
instead of relying just on information
about voltage clock speed and then the
overall power target of the board now is
able to compensate for temperature as
well so if you tell it GTX 670 I am
comfortable with you running at 90
degrees it'll kind of go okay
roger-dodger and then if you put a water
block on it so it's running it you know
45 degrees no matter what
you do then it will continue to strive
to turbo itself up to the absolute
maximum clock speed that it can sustain
all the time no matter what
now the GeForce experience came out of
beta with GTX 780 and obviously it
supports the GTX 770 as well what that
means is you've always got the latest
drivers and you've got recommendations
for the settings that you should run in
the various games you have on your
computer so that you're never running it
wrong I mean honestly my little
brother's a great case of this I hope
he's not watching this video but I gave
the kid a GTX 275 this was a couple
years ago back when that was like you
know a pretty decent card and I go over
and he's running some Call of Duty game
at low details at like 1280 by 800 or
something ridiculous like that on his
1080p monitor I'm just I'm looking at
the kid I'm like really
you're not like it's running it like 300
frames per second you can actually turn
the details out I turn the game up and
he's like oh that's what it's supposed
to look like yeah that's what it's
supposed to look like so GeForce
experience maybe isn't for you but
viewer right now maybe it's not for you
at all maybe you don't care maybe you
want to dial in your own settings
personally I do but maybe it's for
someone that you're recommending a card
for where you know that they're just not
capable of remembering to upgrade their
own drivers or choose their own settings
so there you go I hope my brother's not
watching this also in video is going to
be introducing a new feature in GeForce
experience called shadow play which is
going to allow you to use the built-in
h.264 encoder on your card for a dab
nominal performance hit maybe about 5%
to record your gameplay up to the last
20 minutes of gameplay on the fly all
the time so you never miss a moment when
you're making up your gameplay videos or
or whatever else very cool stuff all the
usual and video technologies are
supported sli up to 3 way now Nvidia
yeah they have cards that support
forward but they're really not talking
about 4 Way SLI anymore it really
doesn't scale very well to a sli scales
great on this card 3 Way SLI is going to
scale ok at higher resolutions 4 Way SLI
tends to not scale that much so it does
support all the slis whichever ones you
want it has a 6 pin and a pin power
adapter the TDP of this card is slightly
higher than the GTX 680 that it comes in
and replaces
but don't worry because the price is
lower which is what's going to make this
card so attractive is that not only do
you get that gtx 680 performance but
i've seen a lot of speculation that from
the leaked pictures of GTX 670 that
Nvidia was building not quite the same
level of quality of a cooler that they
put on the titan and the 780 with its
aluminum construction and polycarbonate
window on the aluminum fins with the
noise dampened fan that's actually got
an updated profile that makes the card
not only run fast but also incredibly
quietly
and illuminated GeForce GTX logo on the
top all of that is false
this features the same level of quality
of cool cool the same cool cooler that
has a high level of quality that's what
I meant to say and it looks absolutely
outstanding in your regen now you can
mean I have heard people buy titans
because they love the way it looks now
you can get the look and a lot of the
performance for a significantly lower
cost with that said no this card is not
gk110 based it is not in the same league
as tighten and gtx 780 but what it does
do is it comes in an attractive price
point and it is able to deliver better
performance than the outgoing gtx 680
particularly at higher resolutions
you've got full support for nvidia 3d
vision surround allowing you to have up
to three plus one display so three in
surround with one auxiliary display and
of course stereo 3d on supported 3d
vision enabled monitors pci express 3.0
interfaces down here on the bottom and
most of the exhaust from this card is
going to go out the back of your case
while some of it will go out these fins
here and that's going to help cool some
of the voltage regulation modules on the
PCB itself I think that pretty much does
it for my GTX 770 overview don't forget
to check out my review content for this
card as well where we walk you through
the nitty-gritty of its performance
