exactly all that enthused by be quiet
cases they were kind of boring and
simplistic in my opinion I'm not saying
they weren't good and if they were your
thing I mean hey you do you man I'm here
to review not judge and this may be the
most modular case that I've ever seen
like seriously everything moves but I'll
get into that later
I would guess judging is kind of part of
the reviewing process but let's not
worry about that just roll the intro
Intel skull Canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link in
the video description down below ok so
as with all of my case reviews let's
start with the front and it's brushed
aluminum door which opens by simply
pressing the top left hand corner so I
suggest doing that with some sort of
cloth or even sticking an adhesive pad
on the corner so you don't stain it with
your finger oils its brushed aluminum
that is a problem it is quite
frustrating to deal with as with all
brushed aluminum but it does look great
as David has said they should almost
call it be careful instead of be quiet I
thought that was kind of funny but and
that's why I'm wearing these gloves it
makes handling the case much more easy
on the reverse side of the door there is
also some noise dampening materials
which does kind of fit the be quiet name
a little better revealed by the door and
starting at the top is a fan speed
controller switch and an LED switch
featured only on the pro model two five
and a quarter inch bays so you can stall
optical drives to use as drink holders
an easily removable fan filter for your
front fans and a giant pull tab to
remove a the fan filter for the entirety
of the bottom of the case including the
power supply way at the back also note
that you need to remove this large fan
filter in order to take off the front of
the case or you'll end up in a funny
situation the top features a Qi charging
area on the pro model and in terms of
i/o you've got two USB 2.0 two USB 3.0
ports headphone and microphone jacks a
large set power button and a small reset
button along with a drive activity LED
the bottom is a continuation of
the brushed aluminum and features some
large feet to pick the case up off the
ground which at first seems a little
weird because there's no venting on the
bottom but it is intended to get the
side mounted venting up out of the
carpet so that the bottom of the case
can breathe that way the left side panel
is the now surprisingly common one giant
piece of tempered glass and is buffered
from some scratches by mounting on
rubber wrapped thread points the right
side panel is basically one large blank
surface of plastic that features some
awesomely captive thumbscrews but there
is a removable panel that features a fan
filter and two 120 millimeter fan
mounting points just in case you really
love buying fans and that brings us to
the inside the back of the motherboard
tray features a satisfactory amount of
cable management zap strap loops a
single two and a half inch drive mount
which is too narrow for comfort as
fitting in a few different SSDs was
legitimately problematic for some of
them the pro version of the fan and LED
controller which features for three pin
fan connectors and for four pin fan
connectors along with two LED strip
connectors to go along with the two
included rigid LED strips and then
everything else moves oh my god
even the previously mentioned side
panels can swap which side they're on
the motherboard can flip over to the
other side of the case or even be raised
or lowered to the hard drive cage which
features up to seven drive slots each of
which can hold one full-size hard drive
or two SSDs if you are so inclined and
yeah it can even change what side it's
on to even the at first weird looking
internal power supply mount makes more
sense once you realize it can slide back
and forth hell yeah
anyways almost nothing on the inside of
the case is in a permanent position this
would allow you to have your computer on
the other side of your desk or have the
front pointed away from you but still
have the internals shown in through all
of their glory through that tempered
glass side panel two gripes that I do
have though are one due to the excessive
amount of thumb screws on the back of
the hard drive stack you'll have a hard
time properly using a right-angle SATA
cable here
and due to the cable management hole
positioning and standoff height for the
motherboard they're not great to use
there either which might cause some
problems and installing the power supply
is a pain four screws for the side
panels four screws for the power supply
itself and then an additional eight
screws for the side mounts for the power
supply and if you're doing a PSU swap
and have a tall screwdriver potentially
another two for your graphics card or
even more if you have other various
add-in cards this totals to 32 screw
operations compared to the standard 16
seems like not a big deal but it's kind
of annoying moving on once you decide
where it all goes out of what I think is
a total of six logical positions you can
then get to cooling it it comes with
three silent wings three 140 millimeter
fans but you can expand on that with a
up to 360 or 420 millimeter rad in the
top and front of the case a 120 or 140
millimeter rad in the back and a 140 or
280 rad in the bottom and the fan mounts
to boot you've got basically whatever
options you may want which may be a
little overkill considering modern
computer components don't even really
generate that much heat but you do you
man a note here as well is that in order
to remove the top of the case you will
need to as it says on page 49 of the
manual frist remove the front panel
wherever they could they included more
of that noise dampening foam quality
construction from a German computer
hardware company insanely modular
computer to the enth degree ability to
house pretty much whatever you want
especially on the cooling side of things
and speed controls and lighting features
to match a bit of an advanced case that
will take some time and planning and
maybe a little bit of frustration but I
say it's a step in the right direction
although I do think a power supply
basement of some sort may have won over
a few more hearts as seeing all of those
cables just laying there feels a little
like the old days although you might
have gotten some more mileage out of it
with some black sleeved cables alright
guys thanks for watching liked it if you
liked it dislike if you disliked it and
you were like whoa that was a lot of
sarcasm and one
don't worry about it I don't really know
why that happened it just did actually
it looks beautiful once you're done it
is just a little bit frustrating to
build in anyways if you're wondering
what to do next you can go to the forum
and discuss this case or various other
thing with a plethora of other internet
people you can check out this product or
others on Amazon and you can buy t-shirt
which isn't this one this one's kind of
cute and stuff but we don't sell it so
that's probably fine check out this
video up here which is something else
from be quiet which will mean that it's
probably an old video hmm I'm gonna just
leave now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
