completely blind on an unboxing this is
the v nine thousand HD g alright so it
comes in a box that sort of looks like
it should be sitting here but as i've
been told that is not an empty box chip
to us it's just part of the packaging
deal so this is made by well i'll let
you figure out who it's made by there
you go and then see you can't see mr. ok
so here we go here's a little bit of
information about it right off the bat
so it's a 5-inch touchscreen HD media
player supports 1080p hdmi and kv you
can read this on your own i'm sure let's
go to this side nothing here okay well
first things first why don't we get this
um let me get this sleeve thing slid off
so that we can get the box open
one-handed unboxing see I'm a man of
many talents now i'm just going to use
your hands okay so take the little
sleeve off okay so now we can see all of
the specs on the back so it says all the
box is totally coming apart look at this
the box fell apart okay that's okay we
can we can read this so let's see if i
can get it and close enough for you to
be able to read it so it's mostly mostly
what I'm guessing is Chinese but there's
some English on here too and I'm going
to try and figure that out it doesn't
help that the headers on the table are
actually in Chinese so full HD 1080p 20
megabit per second it gives a list of a
bunch of formats something about hdmi
and AV I'm guessing those are outputs on
something about nine megabit megabytes
per second full HD something something
okay this is an eight gig version okay
full HD again so we figured out so far
that it is full HD okay it is eight
gigabyte and it is some kind of handheld
media player device so the top cover
comes off and then this is a piece of
yellow plastic that from my
understanding is actually some kind of a
holder
media player okay so next we will find
out good maybe we'll find some more
specs here so here it says full HD 1920
x 1080 this has 12 ATP whatever that
means maybe it's the resolution of the
screen this says hdmi d-block FM and
remote control okay here's a little
finger hole okay I'll put my finger in
there and then pull this up okay next we
have ok there's the that's schmick see
ok let's uh let's get to what else we
have here first okay here's another
piece of plastic oh I get it okay so
this goes with this and it goes well it
goes on the floor when I drop it and
then it goes here so you put that in
there and then just twist it around a
little bit ah hey hey now it's a little
picture stand thing so you can put your
media player there and watch your media
ok so in here we've got some headphones
and here we have a USB a to mini be
charging cable here we have what is this
QC past okay so this one passed QC
that's good that's a good step in the
right direction then we have 12 ATP a
bunch more Chinese I'm not really sure
what all this says but there it is so
hey if you read chinese feel free to
post a translation of anything that
you've seen in this video I would be
very happy to have a look at that okay
here we have what appears to be a
warranty registration although I'd have
an awfully hard time filling this out
given that I only write in English and
only read English maju i could probably
get someone to help me but I don't know
that they'd be able to understand
anything I send them on the other hand
okay so here's the user's manual
hopefully there's English in here and I
will be able to explain what this thing
is very much
mmm something old fat 32 I recognize
that that's a file system fat32
excellent okay moving along something
about installing it something about
charging it oh oh here we go here's some
specs great so it takes DC 5 volt
fifteen hundred milliamps it runs at 800
x 480 I'm guessing that's the screen
resolution here are the supported audio
formats here are the supported video
formats here are the supported photo
formats it supports txt something about
mp3 Oh a radio so it has a radio tuner
FM only by the look of things supported
by windows 7 okay well we have a look at
the headphones that are included comes
in a nice little hermetically sealed
daggy thing so it comes with a couple of
phony earbud pieces that look pretty
destroyed at this point but that's okay
then it's um got some headphones ain't
old brand okay okay they're pretty
nondescript looking probably sound
alright alright so here is the media
player itself so why don't we have a
look so that's quite a large screen it's
some it's not as glossy as it looks in
the camera it's I think it's just
something to do with the quality of
light in this room but is actually quite
a matte finish so it should be pretty
good for viewing in daylight on this
side we have mini HDMI out now we have
USB and then a volume control there's
one little screw here for potentially
taking the device apart up at the top we
have an escape key and a power button
i'm going to go ahead and try and press
the power button and see if it turns on
might be worth a shot but probably not
going to happen okay then on this side
we've got HDTV out headphones out DC in
five volt a microphone spot ah school so
i guess you can record some kind of
voice microsd slot that's pretty neat so
it's got expandable storage that's a
really cool feature to have in a media
player and then there appears to be some
kind of thing on the back no no okay I
never would have guessed this but it's
made in China okay
get in China factories number huh so you
could actually find out the factory this
was made in based on this number I guess
that's kind of cool okay well maybe I'll
do a follow up video then showing it
actually running and maybe playing back
some media but there it is there's the
unboxing of the v nine thousand HD G
made by these guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
