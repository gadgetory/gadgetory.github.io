piece together a pretty darn powerful
eight core gaming rig on the cheap with
some older server hardware namely a pair
of quad core Intel Xeon and some server
grade ECC ddr2 ram and a little bit of
creative modding but some of the fans
made it pretty compelling that there was
an argument for hey instead of drilling
a block of wood to use as a motherboard
mount and lopping off a part of a shiny
gtx 980 why not just use an 8 core AMD
desktop cpu instead indeed why not stay
tuned to find out how our server style
Frankenstein ray held up against an AMD
FX 8350
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free so while the twin Xeon
processors the ECC RAM and the server
motherboard only set us back around one
hundred and fifty dollars total ambe's
most popular eight core cpu the FX 8350
is currently going for 170 by itself on
Newegg and not all that much cheaper on
the used market with cheaper am3+
motherboards going for around 50 bucks
on the same site and 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 memory going for about 60 all of
this retaining much of its value on the
used market you're looking at nearly
double the cost for the desktop
AMD platform but of course you do get
quite a bit extra functionality for this
added cost even lower end currently
available motherboards support now
standard features like USB 3.0 multiple
PCI Express slots and 6 gigabit per
second SATA connections by contrast our
server board only has a measly pair of
USB 2.0 ports I mean even the freaking
Raspberry Pi has more than that one PCIe
slot making any further expansion
impossible once you stick in a graphics
card and only support SATA revision 2
speeds we also needed to separate EPS
power connectors with the server board
we used so you may need to find a power
supply that has a pair of these as well
and obviously you get the luxury of
being able to use your choice of modern
CPU cooler in a real actual ATX case
unless you like that sort of cyberpunk
shady ghetto style piece of tech that
was just thrown together kind of look
which honestly I must admit I kind of
have a soft spot for so I would
understand but all of that aside
performance is what matters most and we
put both of our 8 core setups through a
full battery of comparison tests if
you're curious about the exact parts we
use for these test benches you can see
them on the screen right now first up we
looked at transfer speeds on our Samsung
850 pro SSD using the black magic disk
speed tests on our AMD bench we got a
healthy 513 megabyte per second read
speed and a 465 M
bytes per second write about what we'd
expect from a modern sata3 drive however
our server board was a completely
different story as on it we mustered
only 134 and 128 megabytes per second on
read and write respectively
even though the board is supposed to
support SATA to speeds of up to 300
megabytes per second through its
connectors although there may be a way
to make this work more quickly we
couldn't find anything in the BIOS that
would allow us to increase the speed
there seems to be one post online where
one dude said that he modified it to
work but doesn't actually say how so we
might be able to chalk this up to
another one of those server parts can be
screwy and hard to configure moments
that said if you do want to try out the
server motherboard as a gaming rig
concept you might want to take the time
to locate a board that you know will
support SATA 3 speeds as the system was
noticeably a little slower in common
tasks like browsing through Windows
Explorer moving on to synthetic
benchmarks we saw the AMD desktop setup
perform 40 to 60 percent faster and a
seuss real bench suite which includes
image editing video rendering and
multitasking elements the FX 8350 based
system also beat on our dual Xeon setup
by about 18% in the Cinebench CPU test
and also won the OpenGL test which
renders a scene of a car chase by nearly
40 fps but would this translate to huge
gains in real world gaming situations
the two systems didn't show too much of
a difference in our Far Cry 3 far cry 4
sorry in Crysis 3 benchmarks with our
AMD desktop bench only gaining between
one and three frames per second at 4k
however when we switch to cities
skylines a much more CPU bound title the
difference was massive our FX 8350
system nearly doubled the performance of
our dual Xeon set up so with these
results does it still make sense to go
for the cheaper server setup if you can
get your hands on them it might if all
you're doing with your PC is gaming and
you want to keep your platform costs as
low as possible and allocate more of
your budget to something like say a nice
graphics card of course that depends on
what games are going to be playing so
don't forget that to a CPU bound type
we'll see a significant performance hit
on the old server hardware although our
FX 8350 platform cost about twice the
price we got roughly double the
performance and city skylines offsetting
the additional cash you'd have to fork
out add in a significantly faster
performance and other CPU intensive
tasks and even general computing as well
as many more connectivity options and a
more traditional platform with desktop
class 8 core processor and it looks well
worth the additional cost especially if
you won't have to spend a ton of time
configuring a server board which isn't
exactly designed to be user-friendly all
the time but let's be real for a moment
if the tinkerer in you really wants to
try out this kind of a cost-cutting
challenge that's awesome go for it or if
an 8350 just isn't in your budget it's
certainly possible to have a satisfying
gaming experience on some old Zeon's for
a really really good price just remember
that it might take a little bit more
patience updesk has a wide variety of
powered standing desks available on up
desk comm what almost all of them have
in common is the high quality dual motor
electronically controlled height adjust
system that lets you either manually
raise or lower your desktop surface or
pre-programmed three different heights
for sit-stand or maybe for riding on a
bike or walk on treadmill the one I've
been using since updesk set us up is the
large-sized squared up it's been a great
solution for me due to needing a corner
desk and I actively use the different
profile modes as I have back problems
and being able to rotate between sitting
and standing is great so whether you're
trying to just get into the habit of
shifting positions periodically or if
you want to get some real health
benefits out of your new desk by putting
a treadmill or stationary bike under it
