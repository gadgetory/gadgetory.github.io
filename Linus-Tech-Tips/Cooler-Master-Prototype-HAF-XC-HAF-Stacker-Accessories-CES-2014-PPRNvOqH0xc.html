brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital we're here in the cooler
master suite with a couple of case
concepts that cooler master would really
like to get your feedback on in a couple
of different ways so first up behind me
we've got the half stacker this is that
modular case idea where they've got the
925 and then they've got the 915 and
then you can put another 915 on the
bottom or you can put 2 915 or even 3 9
15 s together and you slide them all
together but they want to go beyond that
in terms of customizability and start
offering upgrade kits whether it's
things like oh I don't know you know USB
3.1 comes out in the future and you need
like a new you know module here whether
okay here's a mock-up for a slimline
optical drive maybe you want to add that
to one of the 915 so you don't care
about front USB but you want one of
these ok cool go ahead have one of those
they've also got a mock-up here for a
windowed side panel for the 915 maybe
you want to just build a dedicated
system just inside that case you want to
upgrade that piece maybe you want like
you know I don't know hard drive cage
add ons okay these are these are pretty
standard these are pretty
straightforward those are available for
lots of cases but the point of all of
this is guys they want to hear your
feedback in terms of what kind of
upgrades you can think of that you'd
like to see for the half stacker series
so that they can continue to develop
their products around the needs of the
people who are interested in this very
unique and very flexible chassis and
here's an interesting one this is very
much pre-production engineering sample
whatever you want to call it and the key
here guys is cooler master wants to hear
from you what you like and what you
dislike about their prototype of the
half X C so the first thing that's going
to stand out to you guys is of course
this wraparound windowed side panel this
is pretty much a finished idea but of
course it doesn't hurt to let them know
what you think about it the idea is that
most of the hardware is on this side so
you've got your motherboard cpu memory
graphics card and then all of the cable
management is actually wrapped around
the back now it's not like we haven't
seen this before but who came up with
the internal layout first is one of
those things where if you dig around
enough you'll be able to settle the
on your own anyway we're not going to
get into that here but the overall
features are it does support a 360
millimeter radiator in the front in fact
the one that's installed in there right
now is an upcoming glacier series so
that is the swiftech coolermaster
collaborative product with a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator as
well as of course the integrated high
quality cpu block and pump and all that
good stuff that we found on the 240
millimeter glacier series cooler now a
bit of a tour of the rest of this case
the top has kind of a 3d mesh as does
the front it kind of reminds me of the
jam box by jawbone except that it's not
nearly as bad sounding although they do
have some kind of loud fans in there
right now your front i/o is taken care
of right here with two USB to two USB 3
in front panel audio the switch is kind
of a large switch that you can press of
course it's a switch anyway okay you've
got to five and a quarter inch bass and
this is kind of a neat thing it's
intended to be stood upright like this
or you can actually turn the little
little cooler master badge and you can
use it as a desktop case as well once we
open up the other side panel will find
the power supply all the loose cables
that were plugged into all the stuff on
the other side as well as room for for
two and a half inch SSDs at the top of
the back and then closer to the front I
actually kind of forget so I'm going to
have to I was hoping to cheat and do
b-roll for all this but I'm going to
have to open up the case and have a look
yes right we have two five and a quarter
inch cages to go along with the five and
a quarter inch bass and then under each
of those is another 2-3 and a half inch
drive cages alright the last products
that cooler master needs feedback on are
the silent flow series fans so this is a
1200 RPM fan that is optimized for low
rpm operation it only comes in a three
pin configuration because DC control can
be better for very very low rpm
operation when you're under voltage
compared to PWM which can have some
weird electrical noises that go along
with it and they are claiming that
they've had this running as low as eight
decibels in a lab so I'm extremely
excited to check that out especially if
they can get it running optimally on
something like a radiator next up we've
got the hybrid flow fan this one again
is very
our experimental one more time and this
uses axial fan technology much like you
would find on your graphics card cooler
and it exhausts there in a couple
different ways so the intake is on the
side that you guys are looking at right
now and then normally you'd go okay so
the exhaust is here and that much is
true there's what looks like about a 70
millimeter or 80 millimeter fan worth of
fan blades that's going to exhaust in
that direction but wait what's this one
of the sides is actually open for
sideways exhaust so say for example you
had an intake on the side of your case
actually the 800d case from corsair is
one that's kind of like this where you
have a side intake and then it's like
it's blowing air in one direction and is
mostly blocked well this will allow you
to maybe get some hard drive airflow for
your cages and then some additional
airflow to your GPUs at the same time so
I'd like to hear from you guys where you
could imagine installing a fan that
intakes from the one side exhaust out
the other side and then like also
exhausts out one of the edges so guys
thank you for checking out this
experimental ideas video from the cooler
master suite here at CES 2014 huge
thanks to NCI XCOM for allowing us to be
here they are our gold sponsor and they
are your source for great technology
selection and service and of course we
want to thank our other sponsors as well
of course our memory and Western Digital
for allowing us to be here without them
we just couldn't do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
