brought to you by the Corsair one gaming
pc and synergy check them out at the
link in the video description you guys
aren't going to believe this we are in
the backroom we are getting an early
hands-on to give you some idea how fresh
this product is this is not even a real
box for look it's like I don't even know
what this says but like it probably says
like top secret or something like that
because inside here we have a Seuss's
new flagship AMD motherboard one that is
for a socket that quite frankly is
probably still quite a ways up from
being something you can actually buy
this right here is the zenith extreme
you have to give me a minute I've got my
24 pin connector all ready to go so I
can get all the RGB lighting illuminated
this is going to be for AMD's upcoming a
rumored thread Ripper product so that's
going to be again rumored 12 14 or 16
core CPUs in a very high-end enthusiast
slash workstation type platform in this
board has all kinds of features some of
which we've seen before and some of
which we haven't so at its heart we've
got their brand new socket tr4 this is
an LG a socket the first time for an AMD
on the consumer I mean if you want to
call it consumer but on the consumer
side of things it has 4,000 94 pins and
you need a freaking screwdriver to open
up the cover and when we do that we see
why this thing looks extraordinarily
fragile and has a configuration that
I've never really seen before it almost
looks like it's 2 CPUs being installed
in a single socket which when you think
about the fact that these things are
going to have 64 PCI Express Lanes hmm
might give you some hints as to how
exactly it is that AMD is building up
this sort of modulars in architecture
CPU here looking pretty bananas it
supports quad-channel memory and oh hold
on a minute what the actual hell is that
this is what ACS is calling a den dot 2
now we've seen MDOT two SSDs before in
fact it's got one under the chipset
cooler right down here but this is the
new way so ACS is building custom memory
module looking things they're still
running off PCI Express so it's not like
a memory SSD octane thing or anything
like that but you can put two on here
for better cooling without having your
SSD sticking out of the middle of the
board it's running an x3 99 chipset
another obvious move from AMD to make
their board sounds kind of like the
Intel one but like better we're going
all the way back to the Athlon XP
performance rating days apparently it's
got two eight pin power connectors which
again adds some more credibility to my
theory about it basically being two CPUs
in there and it's got this is crazy
we've got 802.11 a D Wi-Fi so that's
like multi gigabit Wi-Fi on this thing
it's going to come with a ten gigabit
network card
it's got freaking lights to tell you
which audio port you're plugging in from
the back and it's sli certified it's I
mean what else can we say about this
other than that you're going to have to
sell your car if you want to own one I'm
estimating no one here will confirm or
deny but this thing is going to probably
cost in the 599 u.s. dollar range plus
the fact that you're going to be
spending like we have a thousand bucks
plus on a CPU to go in it but at least
to pay you get an RGB backplate right so
thanks for watching guys we're Computex
coverage is brought to you by the
Corsair one the 12 litre gaming pc that
