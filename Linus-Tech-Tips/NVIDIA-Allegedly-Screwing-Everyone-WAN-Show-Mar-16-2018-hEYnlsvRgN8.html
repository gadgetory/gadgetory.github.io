to say it was when Showtime about 20 min
about 20 minutes ago thank you for your
patience those of you who are watching
on YouTube in a certain area meaningful
to you we were on time today in some
timezone who are on time yeah it's five
o'clock somewhere which is irrelevant
because we don't start at 5:00 yeah wait
yes we do
oh crap but not in that time zone
um okay can we please daylight saving
time oh yeah last week yep so actually
no one's gonna be watching this week
anyway like a go look at the viewership
statistics probably everyone was like
everyone everywhere else in the world
probably thinks that it doesn't start
for an instant for another hour yeah so
no we're for a minute sorry
whoa oh my goodness we are early for
like most of the world that's fantastic
we are so good at this yes like online
content creators yeah all right so we've
got a great show for you guys today
yeah we specifically went out of our way
to avoid talking about it last week and
the reason was that honestly I just
needed a little bit more time to figure
out what the heck was going on here the
GeForce Partner Program
yeah on the surface this looks like some
pretty jank pretty scummy stuff and
below the surface well we'll talk about
it later but I mean realistically if I
was gonna say it's all good I would have
said that before yes there was another
big news item this week security flaws
found in AMD Zen processors from CTS
labs Wow
that's been a drama and a half so but I
think that even technically started last
week - yeah but especially this one
super muddy waters last week and it's
like still kind of confused do you ever
play the game at the beach where you
would like you would like stomp and then
you get like the like the kind of
Godzilla looking cloud that comes out
around your foot and then you'd be like
oh that was fun
stomp and then you would get to the
point where you couldn't really see the
cloud because it because you just mocked
up everything so that was last week
now we've left it for a few hours and
like we can go sort of stomp around a
bit again but it's not it's not clear
either what else we got okay apparently
another Nvidia thing they're both just
slamming it this week apparently they're
gonna announce our TX or rate racing
technology which is pretty interesting
and another companies removing another
headphone jack now it's the same
headphone jack yeah that's fair well I
guess it's a different headphone jack
you know what what's the same kind
that's just really yeah
can you eat either of those things
that's a real bummer because I'm super
hungry I was like if I thought you were
like spilling into a spot I'm sure you
can have these oh I'm not gonna eat you
turkeys not sponsors
Frank they're right there yeah they're
right there and I'd feel better well
first I'd feel worse that I'd feel
better and I'd feel much worse
[Laughter]
why don't we jump into the news um this
is gonna be like
not very many topics but a very long
time yeah I'm not ready for the g-force
partner program we jump into that not
yet yeah yeah let's talk about let's
talk about something kind of trivial I'm
the easy fish first wow you and I are
gonna have to play we're gonna have to
play share the power adapter over the
next little bit here Oh ten percent
that's okay I'm gonna oh I'm on battery
saver already well okay then I'm gonna
turn down my screen brightness a bit
okay Sony removed the headphone jack
from the Xperia XZ 2 and X said to
compact they outlined the details of why
they did this in their blog this was
originally posted on the forum by
diehard live would you mind doing it's
die hard to live die hard to live yeah I
can do a strawpoll heck yeah
do you even consider Sony phones when
buying a phone that is a fantastic
strawpoll would you consider a Sony
phone now yeah here in North America
Sony's market share is like third this
is one of the reasons why I want to do
this poll though because we don't
necessarily have just in North America
not exactly it'll be a little skewed
because we're live right now yeah if
this was the if we were able to get
these results from the YouTube audience
I think it would be different than what
it's going to
now someday when we're streaming on
float plane and that stream and then go
we could have like perpetual pulling
that like sits right under the video and
that would be super cool I totally work
I mean yeah it's all sort of theoretical
at this point because flow plane is not
it's particularly fully featured at the
moment last week I'm not trying to be a
dress or anything last week hit a little
deep that that comets further yep
okay so I've gone ahead I've dropped the
straw poll in there but it's how this
was originally posted on the forum by
die hard to live and they basically
outlined the two reasons for removing
the headphone jack that subjectively are
probably about the worst reasons that
you could do anything and contribute to
in my opinion oh my god was that
absolutely okay I haven't read there two
reasons before was that actually it or
did we just like come up with that
contribute to probably why I think
probably why the straw poll results will
be what I think they will be so I pull
up the results here would you consider a
Sony phone remember we didn't say would
you buy a Sony phone yeah we said would
you even consider even think about it at
all
we've got 26% of you saying yes 74% of
you saying no and only 500 of you even
bothering to vote which is some pretty
low numbers for these winchell which I'm
gonna put that category as a wow I
really don't care and no one is even no
one is even still voting like the
results aren't even rolling in anymore
oh wait yes that yes they are oh oh and
it's died off pretty hard at 6:35 it
died off pretty hard it's like still
kind of going it's okay so here are the
reasons that Sony outlined for making
this decision and you gotta remember the
the strong opinion on this would be a
yes anyone thinking no like it's kind of
effort for them to be like yeah so like
there's probably a way higher percentage
of people that actually wouldn't
consider but anyways reason number one
it looks more sleek without it
so by that logic a human would probably
look more sleek without an anus but you
probably shouldn't remove it reason
number two I thought you were gonna hold
it together on that one but you couldn't
to other companies are doing it oh so
painful now in fairness it's not
actually what they said in fairness to
Sony in fairness to Sony hold on a
second here okay look do you want me to
read the whole thing this is part of the
shift to our new ambient flow design
language in order to create the
beautiful seamless design our designers
needed to remove the headphone jack plus
we were aware of the major market trends
towards wireless headphones over wired
headphones so yes they literally did
they literally did say that mmm
so okay in fairness to Sony in defense
of Sony something that I'm not a hundred
percent sure if they deserve right now
no one cares about their phones anyways
no that is not what I was going to say
we grew there I was also kidding in
fairness to Sony I never I never sent
the announcement video live I was trying
to figure out why so few people used to
like their phones until we had so many
of them just bend in half yeah well - I
think three Burkle's mine yours Burkle's
did - yeah oh I didn't even know that
yeah how do you manage to do that it was
a compact oh the compacts have the same
issue is just less like it was just
Buerkle he's an action man I'm probably
more actually in his pants Wow I meant
like wow okay actually my defense of
Sony is actually worse than anything you
said in defensive in Tony's defense the
last time they tried to do something
really innovative that was probably
really expensive from an Rd perspective
because remember Sony was the one that
made waterproof mainstream that's cool
that was very cool that's why I used to
really like their phone and then it
still didn't manage to sell more phones
because of it but that's a whole other
issue the last time they tried to do
something they were the first to have a
4k display now creating a
4k mobile display you guys got to
understand when you have a feature on
your phone let's say 1 plus launches a
2560 by 1080 mobile display yeah 1 plus
did not go and get that freaking panel
created bear a relatively small player
and when you're a relatively small
player doing relatively small volume you
don't get to walk up to Samsung's
display division or LG or auo or
Phillips or whoever it is you don't get
to walk up and be like yo we need a
custom SKU it needs to have this color
gamut this response time it needs to be
this size at this resolution they're
gonna laugh you out of their office you
get to do that when your Apple when your
Samsung Believe It or Not apples knotch
display was custom created just for them
because until Apple did it of course
after Apple does it which ties into some
of these other reasons yeah of course
other people want it but until Apple did
it nobody else was gonna want that okay
so so Sony would have had to actually
create a 4k mobile display in that form
factor for that phone that quite
honestly they probably didn't sell a ton
of based on our straw poll results and
also you can just google it and just see
like the people around you what phones
are using so they didn't yeah once last
time you saw one yeah so so Sony didn't
probably get a great ROI on that
particular you know breaking the mold
kind of investment although even then
giving them credit for breaking them all
in that way is not entirely friendly
because they were just following an
overall market trend they were just
trying to get out ahead of it in a way
that was totally meaningless and stupid
yes and almost never even worked anyways
the phone ran in default 1080p almost
all the time and then you'd like view a
picture that was in 4k and you'd have to
wait a second and then it was just like
and then change resolution of it was
really weird it was very odd almost
everything ran at 1080p but anyway so I
can see how they don't want to take any
risks because you have to move a lot of
devices to make up for any kind of R&amp;amp;D
investment beyond just even the base
um but I'm just I'm disappointed I I was
thrilled to see that Samsung still had
the headphone jack on the s9 and s9 plus
I think that you know what yeah the
mainstream is moving to wireless but
Samsung is going to sell some handsets
just for that and I really hope that
they do get rewarded for it you know all
right what do we got for our next topic
here all big deep ones I just have such
as this thing if you want to go pretty
light and easy no no let's just let's
just get this out of the way okay so the
GeForce Partner Program this was
originally posted on the forum this is
actually an 11-page topic over on our
forum and it was posted by WM groom a
Kay and this lady or gentleman whichever
it is going on here
basically read an article over on Hart
OCP from Kyle Bennett and said this
found all of this interesting if his
reporting checks out because basically
and and this is sort of the problem this
came to light from AMD bringing some of
the details of what's called the GeForce
Partners Program or GPP to his attention
and you got a look at that's yeah you
got a look at no matter who it is like I
I get that whoever you're a fanboy of
whether it's AMD or Intel or Nvidia I
get that there's this like tribalism
thing that's that's wired into us as
human beings and when someone else does
it it's the worst and when we do it it's
just us getting back at them for being
bad people but you got to understand
that any time any any company brings
something to your attention oh hey um
have you noticed them doing this there's
an agenda at play there's room first in
almost every action is selfish whether
it's helpful other people or not there's
some amount of em
that is usually selfish which is okay in
a lot of cases but it's just something
to be aware of yes it's you got to live
your life sort of thinking about that in
everything that you do so the basic
summary is that the story began when
several sites including Hart OCP were
alerted to the goings-on by a by AMD in
a blog post from March first Nvidia
outlined their new geforce partner
program which ostensibly helps consumers
identify brands that deliver the GeForce
promise of delivering the best PC gaming
platform bar none so let's go ahead and
pull up in videos blog post that nvidia
is very good at this oops there we go
let's pull up in videos blog post that
nvidia is so good at this sort of puts
it in the shiniest possible terms what
they're doing here this is the headline
the geforce partner program helps gamers
know what they're buying oh boy I was
having trouble figuring out what I was
buying before I'm sure glad that I know
now it like last stream we talked about
how confusing Intel SKUs are yeah
graphics card SKUs are not a huge
problem on the in videos yeah actually
and even on the AMD side yeah it's
pretty straightforward they're not that
bad higher number is more better there
was a little bit of confusing this
intersection there but it's the first
number is the generation and then beyond
that higher is more better I think it
got a little bit confusing on the AMD
side when we had like a URI and actually
no Nvidia does have some stupid BS going
on right now where the three gig and the
six gig version of the 1060 are actually
different cards yeah yeah okay so hold
on a sec is well wait a minute is it
Nvidia rescuing us from themselves is
that what's happening right now we also
had that stuff where the Titan XP and
the Titan xpp that okay that was really
annoying great that was really so
especially when the whole community
nicknamed the first one the XP yeah and
then they called their next one the XP
okay
okay so fine okay fine you know what
then
let's play let's play nvidia advocate go
wait let's play nvidia advocate and say
they did need to do something about this
confusing industry so let's have a look
at what they said good man wow this
starts off horrible like right within
the first two lines the GPU and software
of a gaming pc make all the difference
in a gamers experience and together with
our add-in card and system partners
we're dedicated to building the best PC
gaming platform BarNone this is the
geforce promised partner program is
designed to ensure that gamers have full
transparency into the GPU platform and
software they're being sold now I'm not
I'm gonna let you finish but did you
ever read stuff that just makes you like
tired I'm doing it right now
I'm sure where you were going with yeah
imma let you finish but there was no
ambiguity here there there's already
marketing incentives and in some cases
like basically an arm twisted behind the
back like this where Nvidia really has a
lot of control over the the badges that
are put on for example a product box or
in the case of add-in cards even the
overall design like you could take a
picture from the side of an entire shelf
of cards made by MSI asus gigabyte EVGA
and all the Nvidia ones would be
basically the same because NVIDIA has
mandated and they have lots of levers
they can pull to control their partners
but NVIDIA has mandated that they need
to kind of look like this and the levers
that they can pull include pricing
allocation of the hot parts that
actually sell partner support so things
like providing engineering support for
your custom boards access early access
to the parts so you can begin
development ahead of other guys and all
this kind of stuff has existed forever
and that's like totally kind of fine
kind of kind of there's there's some
issues in some realms but most of it is
fairly standard practice
okay fine is a relative term most of
this is fairly standard practice for a
lot of different yeah depending on how
it's done so that we we get a lot of we
we get a lot of sort of feedback from
our community that the perception is
that were sort of like friends of Nvidia
but the reality of it is we're not
friends with anybody we are a business
and we have business partnerships and
from a product perspective we like
Nvidia products just fine from a sort of
how we perceive their reputation within
the industry we have some misgivings
ones that we have brought to light in
the past yeah particularly actually I
think probably the most recent example
is the 1066 Gagan three gig that's an
extremely recent example we didn't like
the way they did that well I mean like
we mentioned it this show but there's
also the recent change to GeForce
experience
yes we've also mentioned that which was
like we put them on blast for that and I
still don't install it and I still don't
recommend it and while I am NOT always
at liberty to talk about especially the
sources of the the the frustration with
Nvidia that takes place behind the
scenes there's a lot of it that we're
aware of and there's a lot of
arm-twisting and you know it's you know
think about it think in videos like the
partner that stands there posing for a
picture with you and has their foot on
your toe yeah be like smile properly I
mean that's the perception that I get
these come say hi so let's continue
reading about the g-force promise here
this transparency into what you're
buying is only possible when Nvidia
brands and partner brands are consistent
so the new program means that we'll be
promoting our GPP partner brands across
the web on social media and events and
more so this sounds like oh and Vidya is
doing a great things for their partners
GPB partners will also get early access
to our latest innovations and work
closely with our engine
team to bring the newest technologies to
gamers partners are signing up fast they
see the benefit of keeping brands and
communication consistent and transparent
does this not have like a witch witch
Harry Potter movie is it where Umbridge
takes over this the professor the the
the prim and proper yeah you know yeah
lady who turns out to be like an
absolute monster
remember the name of it but I think it's
the second last one yeah not really
important yeah the point is does this
not have like yeah kind of a rules for
you know proper behavior as students
kind of vibe to it
yeah the program isn't exclusive
partners continue to have the ability to
sell and promote products from any one
partners choose to sign up for the
program and they can stop participating
at any time there's no commitment to
make any monetary payments or product
discounts for being part of the program
GPP ensures our engineering and
marketing efforts support brands
consumers associate with g-force that
transparency will give gamers the
confidence needed to make their purchase
whichever products they choose now I
don't often feel the need to read out an
entire press release from a company
because a lot of the time frankly I feel
like companies should pay me to read
their stupid press release like honestly
the press releases though that's not
journalism that's not object that's not
objective that's advertising they
literally pay someone to write it and
then they pay like market wire to
distribute it not that that's what it is
okay so on the surface this sounds like
everything about this is voluntary and
terrific but let's look at the state of
the GPU market right now if you if you
can get GPUs you are making Bank because
of the whole cryptocurrency mining thing
and pent-up demand from gamers who
haven't been able to get GPUs because of
the cryptocurrency mining thing if you
can't get GPUs you are basically plumb
out of luck and NVIDIA without doing
anything
that could open them up to a lawsuit can
plausibly say we just didn't have enough
for you you were on the list sorry and
if you're let's say someone like EVGA
for example you have other businesses
you sell motherboards you sell crazy
ridiculously high waters power supplies
yeah you sell power supplies you sell
cases even but let's be honest when's
the last time you saw an EVGA
motherboard out in the wild so they sell
they sell motherboards but do they sell
a lot of them compared to someone like
an asus or a gigabyte no not really
and that isn't to say that they're bad
boards that's just to say that they
aren't as popular and that EVGA is
business is very reliant on GPUs so if
EVGA couldn't get allocation of GPUs to
say that their business would suffer
would be a gross understatement
so Nvidia is blog post outlining how
this is all very voluntary it just
ensures that they get the benefits of
being part of the partner program it
comes across a little bit disingenuous
because that's not what's going on here
what's going on is that if you don't
join the partner program you're not
going to get allocation and your
business is going to suffer and you're
gonna have to layoff real people with
real families who won't have a job
anymore and won't be able to support
them and that's something that if I'm a
company like EVGA that for the most part
my experience with them has actually
been very positive I would like to
believe that they care about so you're
pretty much joining the GeForce Partner
Program so let's go to the hard OCP
article a huge shout-out to Kyle for for
doing what he was doing here so hard OCP
began interviewing AI bees and OEM
sometimes I'm gonna reshare this into a
sex I showed it why yeah go ahead hit
twitch chat with that it's really
important so they began interviewing a
IBS and OMS
communicated a few things one that the
geforce partner program has terms in it
that are likely illegal number two that
the geforce partner program is going to
likely tremendously hurt consumer choice
and number three that the geforce
partner program will disrupt business
with companies that are currently doing
business with AMD in particular AMD and
intel the other thing that he gleaned
and we haven't been able to verify this
cuz here's what you guys got to
understand I don't I've never seen the
agreement and I know for a fact I will
never see the agreement it would shock
me if anyone ever saw this agreement out
in the public but what I know about
agreements like this is that let's say
for example that a gag order was done in
an illegal fashion let's say I made you
sign some kind of an agreement that says
yes spicy agreement okay if you talk
about this agreement I will kill you and
you won't authorize me to kill you oh
okay
obviously illegal but let's say it
wasn't murder let's say it was something
slightly less black and white than that
like I'll kill your company yeah like
that which to a lot of people is kind of
close yeah I mean people have committed
suicide over that's something what I
mean yeah so let's say that it was
something like that you could you could
you could you could break the agreement
at some point but until you fight me in
court and prove that depending on the
way it's wording because expensive
lawyers can do expensive lawyer things
depending on the way it's worded the
onus could be on you to prove that you
don't owe me whatever it was so your
business could effectively be destroyed
in the years and after the money that it
costs you to fight me
so even though I have an illegal term
and I have a potentially illegal
punishment for it you don't want to be
the one who steps out of line because I
can punish you in the mean time in ways
that would destroy you
to the point where it would never matter
if what I did was illegal because you
wouldn't even exist to take a payout
anymore
five years ten years down the road when
you would be in a position to finally
get your payout now that is a real
possibility and I'm not saying that I
know that that's what's happening but
what I do know is that nobody is
coughing up this agreement and I do know
that agreements like this do exist okay
so with all of that in mind
further information that hard OCP is
publishing alleges that the GeForce
Partner Program and I think okay - - I'm
not disagreeing with anything you're
saying
okay but to play a little at sides I
know I know I know but to play a little
bit both sides yeah alleges is a pretty
important word like there's a lot of
according to Kyle Bennett's article on
hard OCP and a lot of it makes sense and
I'm explaining how it could make sense
but it lines up pretty okay but like
okay so thank you but like yeah I just
want to make sure that's clear because
while this may make sense and all that
kind of stuff it's not technically
complete it's it's all alleges okay so
Kyle's article further alleges that in
order to have access to the GeForce
partner program partners must have their
own gaming brand aligned exclusively
with GeForce now think about that for a
minute because that's been a huge trend
over the last ten years or so I think
ROG
just celebrated its 10-year anniversary
with the ram-paige 5 extreme they had a
10-year anniversary edition of that
board and ROG was one of the two aces
his credit this was a soos doesn't
always get marketing right but to ease
his credit they built the ROG brand when
I called it a stupid idea way back in
the day so kudos to them and the rest of
the industry basically was playing
follow the leader and that's yeah I
would also say they they have nailed it
so a few times asus rog gigabytes a Oris
lenovo's legion who else do you have
Dells XPS or alienware to a greater
extent XPS is less gaming these days
opposed to be dungeon is been having
more of an issue getting its well they
just launched that's fair like CES 15
months ago or something like that so
give them some time yeah but it also
alleges that all of these brands will
have to be exclusively aligned with
GeForce so even though in videos blog
post says partners continue to have the
ability to sell and promote products
from anyone the GPP documentation
allegedly says that those who do not
participate will lose benefits like high
effort engineering engagements early
tech engagement launch partner status
game bundling sales rebate programs I'll
get back to that one social media and PR
support marketing reports and marketing
development funds so let's get back to
sales rebate programs and marketing
development funds for a minute here the
way the tech industry works and there's
a reason for it because if you gave
every mom-and-pop computer shop a $1
discount they would take it straight to
price and sell the product for cheaper
which as a consumer you might go wow
that's great but it isn't necessarily
because we talked about this previously
when Intel wasn't providing the support
that we feel like they should on their
previous generation chipsets in terms of
patching force vector and meltdown but
the problem with just charging the bare
amount is that it doesn't give you the
the business
warchest that you need to well to go to
war in the event that you have to and
it's one of those things where it kind
of relies on a business to behave in a
manner that is in good faith acting in
the consumers best interest but a
business that is making a healthy profit
is in a better position to as an extreme
example still exist a year later when
you come back for warranty support you
actually need the companies that you buy
things from to make a profit yeah does
that make sense yeah okay so anyway the
problem with the IT industry is that it
tends to be and it's kind of a cultural
thing I'm not gonna get any deeper into
it than that but it tends to be a race
to zero industry volume volume volume
take down as much margin as you can so
you can take the volume that your
competitor would have been doing forced
them under and then someday we'll raise
the prices yeah and you do eventually
see that like the hard drive industry
enjoyed a short period of great margins
when basically everyone was gone and
then they were supplanted by the SSD
industry in the mainstream and to be
clear hard drives are still doing fine
in the cloud they're not going away or
anything but that business is a b2b
business which tends to be lower margins
so there was like there was like a
golden hour there for the hard drive
industry here do you need this yeah go
for it right so the way that the tech
industry works is that the pricing is
fixed you just say okay look a core i5
eighty six hundred K that's $200 us and
then the way that you actually provide
promotions or the way that you make
someone like up formerly so when I
worked at NCIX
the way that NCIX was able to
differentiate from mom-and-pop shops was
not the sticker price it was the back
end support because every CPU we sold we
got a couple percentage kickback at the
end of the quarter and every CPU we sold
well you know during Black Friday we
might get five bucks or ten bucks off
now all of a sudden mom-and-pop in order
to compete with us have to sell below
cost giving us an advantage that's the
way that you actually stay competitive
and
be clear this isn't some kind of like
subversive cloak-and-dagger nonsense
because within sort of the the
mainstream stores that you shop at best
buy a new egg I mean okay some of these
are kind of dated references a tiger
direct memory Express Canada Computers
Micro Center Amazon the programs are
basically across the board pretty
similar and whenever someone finds out
that they get a bot approach that
someone else got a program that they
didn't there's outrage and usually the
brand ends up kind of doing something to
make it up to you and then the other guy
complains about that is all negotiations
it's business as usual now the problem
here is that with GPUs in particular
Nvidia maintains a lot of control over
the pricing at every level to the
partners and to the end users through
tools like these kinds of rebates so
they sell the chipset to the vendor at
some price X but then Nvidia could
decide a week later to go Wow you know
what here's a sell-through rebate
effectively lowering the price without
actually lowering the sticker price
meaning that someone who has a
multi-week in some cases lead time
between acquiring chips and then turning
them into boards delivering them to
retailers and eventually selling through
them might effectively have a bunch of
stock that's overpriced now and no real
recourse for getting rid of it and so
it's adding videos discretion to support
you to get rid of it which is a fairly
direct way a fairly strong but indirect
way to sort of choke out a company
that's right so game bundling MDF and
sales rebate programs are basically like
saying you'll never make money on
graphics cards again if you were to
remove all that stuff yeah okay I forget
where we were going with this but
partner brand aligned exclusively with
Nvidia partners have the ability to sell
and promote products from anyone but
allegedly this behind the scenes
documentation says they'll get all of
this support cut and to be clear the
public documentation doesn't say any of
that okay her hard OCP has been told
that if a company does not participate
GPP they feel not buy-in video as if in
video would hold back allocation of GPUs
from their inventories this has not been
spelled out contractually but the
feeling is that it's done on a wink and
a nod to be fair they said that the
stuff we just mentioned losing all these
different things yeah was in the
documentation this is a feeling
yeah the allocation bid is a feeling and
then the next part the Ruatoria vote is
also a like feeling yeah so it was
expressed too hard OCP that publishing
that article could damage hard OCPs
relationship with nvidia oh well we've
gotten to the end of it now I guess I
guess we're in the same boat look at
that but knowing and like okay to jump
all the way back to the beginning of
this conversation in terms of like
there's always there's very extremely
massively off dynamic as they always
because someone's gonna call me on that
it's some weird way but there's
basically always a selfish reason for
everything
well the self is region is tiny or huge
whatever yeah saying if if you release
this Nvidia is gonna be mad with the
thing that the heart OCP was probably
pushing them to release it um Kyle has
been in the industry a long time he's
yeah we connected they may have actually
had his best interest at heart possibly
but from articles that I've read from
him before - no issue but pushing that
kind of stuff but let's go let's go
let's let's take the helicopter up
another thousand feet and let's go
why were they talking to him at all yeah
yeah seriously so so the particular
warning might have been in Kyle's best
interest but the fact that they're
talking to him at all is probably in
their own best interest and I'm sure
they know that he likes juicy article
and also for the consumers best interest
potentially like because remember there
there could be a selfish kernel but that
doesn't mean yeah it doesn't benefit
I'll hold onto people and that we didn't
know how much rationalize the benefit
you're providing to yourself by saying
well it also helps out all these other
guys which is great in a lot of
situations that's honestly mostly how
charity works but yeah like
you just don't know how much how much of
this is helping other people how much of
this is and for Kyle to talk about how
this article could damage the
relationship with NVIDIA you can find a
selfish kernel there too by saying that
he's adding credibility to his own
publication by saying you know what I'm
willing to risk damaging my relationship
with Nvidia in order to bring you guys
the facts and in this case this actually
does look to me and I'd I haven't seen
the partner agreement and I won't admit
to having talked to anyone about this
behind the scenes but this looks to me
like it actually does have the potential
to damage a relationship with Nvidia
Nvidia is well it comes back to the
portrait Nvidia smiles a lot and they
they talk about partnership a lot and
what they mean is they have expectations
of their partners and if their partners
don't meet them hmm hmm that's my
perception and a lot of people think
that we're like super super chummy with
Nvidia but I've said before in the past
and I'll say it again now we have done a
grand total of three sponsored
engagements with Nvidia we did some
pre-rolls way back when we first started
and those were actually that was a
complicated thing because probably none
of you even remember them it was ten
spots and they were all for a particular
EVGA graphics card but the funding was
being passed through via MDF from Nvidia
so that one hardly even registers number
two we went down to California and
hosted mod 20 for their modding event we
were paid what I consider to be a very
modest fee for that kind of an
engagement yeah and the number three
this was the first time they had
actually done flat out a sponsored video
with us ever they did something with us
in q4 talking about how to game at 4k
they were actually pretty
easy to work with which was kind of
refreshing because we were able to talk
about game consoles as well we kept it
very objective and we told them upfront
we were like look we never actually work
with you guys on sponsored stuff but
there's this perception that we're in
your pocket so you got to understand
we're gonna have to approach this very
carefully yeah and they were actually
pretty cool about it but that's the
extent of it
we have worked far more extensively with
AMD Intel a seuss I think we've done
more stuff with MSI I mean certainly
more stuff with the regular partners
like like Squarespace ZOTAC we haven't
really done much big stuff we've done
actually we've done a fair bit so tag
yeah ok yeah yeah like most people there
you go so are we putting ourselves at
risk given that the relationship was
finally starting to warm up and we were
really getting some stuff done like us a
dedicated sponsored video with us is one
of the one of the biggest things that a
partner can do with us and we finally
did one with them given things we're
starting to warm up yes we're putting
ourselves at risk but given that our
business survived just fine for the 5
years prior to that no it's not a ton so
we're not gonna act like white knights
here or anything like that
but I also said allegedly a lot you said
allegedly a lot because reception and
that I'm not gonna admit to having
talked to anyone I'm gonna say this I
haven't talked to anyone and I'm also
gonna say this I'm not always a hundred
percent honest with you guys
so you can read into that whatever you
feel like I want to add one thing before
we jump into sponsor spots but one thing
I want to add to you is some of this
stuff is future traceable so you'll be
able to tell yeah just keep that in mind
like one of the smart things you can do
if you're trying to keep an agreement
under wraps is you could give everyone
slightly different terms that's fair
yeah and that way if it came to light
you could kind of go OK if it was one of
them them or them and then something
else came to light you could go it was
them
so even if I knew anything and I am
being honest this is honest answers
episode whatever this is has lino seen
the agreement the answer is no I have
not seen it and I have been told by the
people that I would never admit that I
have talked to that I will never see it
and that they will never tell me any
details about it okay that actually did
happen as well okay anyone that I won't
admit that I talked to told me they
would never show it to me and they would
never tell me the details of it so that
happened okay so there you go yeah let's
talk about let's talk about something
like probably not horrible here's
spectrum glasses Hey like my life is far
less complicated right now talking about
spectrum glasses instead of like stuff
because this is just it's simple okay if
you stare at a monitor all day the blue
light blue can be bad for your eyes this
filters it without having a huge impact
on the color accuracy of the world
around you and compared to a software
solution like flux or twilight is more
effective there that's kind of weird
like I I've got a flux equivalent on my
phone I don't know what it's called
yeah and it's kind of jarring yeah
they're stylish you've got tons of
different styles to choose from
including ones for kids they're high
quality they feel good they feel good in
the hand they got a one-year warranty
not just in the hand on your face - it's
like spectrum it works great in your
hand and on your face spectrum will walk
them in your hand
you'll want it on your face that would
actually be an interesting commercial
for them to run it's just like hands
people glasses you're like wow these
feel these feel great and then they just
like it they won't put them on now try
putting it on you and the person's like
you know you should you should try it on
and there's like no it just it feels
amazing so they're primarily focused on
the Canadian and US markets but they're
expanding to Europe and they offer
shipping internationally check them out
at spectrum glasses comm slash
collections slash prospect or at the
link right there
still think it's a pro spec pros but
Rowan's yeah yeah use offer code Linus
to save 10% i if i was spectrum i would
change our offer code to use offer code
idiot I would read it I would read
anything for money that's what people
think of me so I might as well just do
it just embrace speaking of anything for
money if you're a freelancer or small
business owner doing whatever it is that
you do for money fresh books is here to
help fresh books is the super simple to
use invoicing tool but actually does a
lot more than help you create and send
slick-looking invoices it helps you
track your time with their timesheet
function manage your expenses and keep
track of who owes you what we've also
got a feature that tells you when your
client has looked at your invoice for
the first time so you can put an end to
the guessing games the mobile app has
all the functionality of the desktop
version so you can take fresh books with
you wherever you go it's available for
Android and iOS and if you have any
questions you can reach out to their
support staff where you will speak to a
real human no phone tree no escalations
no return calls just answers go to fresh
books talk comm slash win for an
unrestricted 30-day free trial and enter
when in the how did you hear about a
section all right one thing we did a one
topic when show too that people are
running super hard with the allegedly
thing everything's allegedly and I above
it and then the other thing is people
are saying that the offer code should
just be ID 10 D oh yeah that could work
it's not a bad offer code pretty good
I'm hungry enough to eat Reaper jerky
let's and I'm not being paid by Savage
that's pretty epic okay awesome sweater
I don't think I've ever done that from a
company before I like their shirt and I
like the logo on this shirt sounds like
you guys should make a sweater
my quality one tastes great and isn't
bad for you turkeys manner
oh my god that would be really gross
actually but thank your girlfriend be
like I can't wait to get that off of you
[Laughter]
it's probably not a good idea
yeah well he asked if I wanted a hockey
sweater or
like a more american-style sweater I was
like that that's a good point I'll be
kind of interesting to have a like Oh
hockey style Savage sure he's wearing
that doesn't help
pickups yeah water doesn't make it
better
oh it's all plain to undo for playing
ball you're all screwed up no do the aim
you do full plate before you know B
first I hate you so much
[Laughter]
how's a big bite I haven't eaten in a
while you have to build up us you have
to build up a tolerance I'm like
straight up crying right now okay I
thought I did bad this week videos on
videos on floatplane what our OEMs
original equipment manufacturers I think
everyone's heard this term yeah what is
it we explain cool scraping thermal
paste oh by the way you're looking at
the new layout of the floatplane site
yeah in order scraping thermal paste is
Intel sterile paste actually that bad we
got a bagful of processors delayed them
harvest the thermal paste and then use
it on a liquid metal CPU against normal
thermal paste cool all right
ahh invidious first SLI gaming setup
reconstructed 6800 GTS
I mean for sport mode we've been working
on that for a long time yep two thousand
two million dollar clean room drive
saviors data recovery tour you should
watch this he likes that want to yeah I
haven't seen it yet but I'm really
excited tech quickie how does eye
tracking work I saw that foam nails like
testing the 56 core system holy bleep
dude we don't have bleeping on the
windchill this was a simultaneous or
know this was a short window the laptop
to buy right now the LG Graham 2018 they
added Thunderbolt great laptop
until CPU letters explained I don't
think that's actually on YouTube yet and
then we do do some exclusive content not
a ton but I tested the Nvidia shield
from the NCIX auction so no spoilers but
that's over there as well and I think I
think that's all we got on there right
now you're doing pretty good yeah you
recovered quite a bit I have I have
recovered okay so let's talk about the
next completely AIDS topic posted by
coaxial gamer on the forum security
flaws discovered in AMD's and processors
so this sounds on the surface like Oh
either yeah you know what depending on
what kind of a tinfoil hat you wear this
could sound like a lot of things this
could sound like Intel trying to make
AMD look bad this could sound like AMD
actually having security flaws and like
them being all like being up on their
high horse when Intel was dealing with
their flaws wow they're a bunch of jerks
or it looks like it may even be possible
that this was an independent group
looking to make AMD stock perform poorly
so they could short it so CTS lassu a
security company based in Israel
announced Tuesday that its researchers
had found 13 critical security
vulnerabilities that would let attackers
access data stored on Andy's Zen family
processors including Rison and even
their epic server processors as well as
install malware on them the
vulnerabilities have been put into four
groups called master key rise and fall
fallout and chimera thankfully nearly
all of these vulnerabilities require
root access in order to be exploited but
it does get sketchy the researchers gave
AMD less than 24 hours to look at the
vulnerabilities and respond before
publishing the report now that's not
illegal but that is not considered to be
industry not being a douche practices
yeah what else we got here standard
vulnerability disclosure calls for at
least 90 days so the companies have time
to address flaws properly
google gave intel six months to fix
issues related to specter and meltdown
so
if it's less than 90 days that could be
like rivals like Google and Facebook
being like yeah oh well you know we gave
you enough time to fix it we're going
public with this cuz it makes them look
bad right it doesn't make you look that
bad when a vulnerability goes public
because everyone has issues when a
vulnerability goes public but it's like
already fixed so if you're trying to
cause PR damage to someone you might go
live in 30 days so that you could be
like well they had a whole month to fix
this yeah and kind of plausibly say that
24 hours that's not even enough time to
check your email the researchers pre
briefed media and a company that makes
money by shorting the stock market
before going live with it
Viceroy research published an obituary
for AMD just 30 minutes after CTS labs
publicized the vulnerabilities so this
is some sketchy stuff now I'm not saying
that these researchers aren't qualified
to do CPU research I don't know there's
been a lot of weird stuff to like people
tried to deep dive this and one of the
ones that I saw was like someone figured
out that the backgrounds and all the
videos were stock photos mm-hmm
so they're like they don't have real
reddit they don't even have a real
office or they may have a real office
but it doesn't look like super Pro like
that yeah but at the same time if you
pay attention to backgrounds throughout
the videos at one point in time they're
like middle frame on a photo that was
taken mostly at the floor so like the
person would have to be standing on like
a 70 degree angle off the ground this
way yeah for it to be realistic like I
don't think they were actually kind of
fool people yeah it was also like a
super overproduced kind of video - like
it yeah had kind of a sleazy vibe to me
but that's okay not surprising from a
company that's probably not released a
video like a Kickstarter except that the
production values were pretty good so
for some reason they spent money well to
make a good-looking video but um here I
think this is it
it was a great article from reborn com
I'm gonna go ahead I'll post this for
you guys banner but check this out like
this is actually done well so they put
money into looking like they had an
office
okay sort of but hold on then look at
this one like that's that's the floor
those servers are reflecting on this
photos taken from the floor it's a
reflective floor I think no oh I got
that wrong
yeah it's half way down the server rack
yeah nevermind so alright umm I thought
that was the floor right here wait hold
on but but no I I don't I thought it was
really reflective polished floor but now
I kind of think that's just yeah so um
does it does it look really really janky
yes I guess that's basically all we have
to say about that
yeah so there may actually be security
issues but yeah there also might not be
or they also might just be like giant
jerks
all right um in videos ray-tracing thing
we're like out of time is there anything
else that's like absolutely critical
that we have to talk about this week I
feel so bad James spent all day on this
dock and we ended up talking about the
Nvidia thing the whole time
famous people play video games that's a
thing that happens yeah EA is turning
star wars battlefront 2 into a real game
apparently I'm a real game no no one
cares the progression is now linear star
cards or any other item impacting
gameplay can only be ran through
gameplay will not be available for
purchase so basically they made their
money I guess or people stopped playing
I guess one of the two starting in April
you'll be able to get appearances
directly through in-game credits or
crystals all I need to do is make it
Star Wars Battlefront 2 battlegrounds or
battle royale or battle extravaganza and
then they'll make all their money back
yeah they're gonna be rolling out a
bunch of new mods over the coming months
cool so there you go make it that and
you'll do great
twitch prime now offers free games every
month Amazon just like spending that
money hey pretty nuts
apparently games for March six to a
predominant played a great game
oxen-free shadow tactics mr. shifty and
tales from candlekeep
tomb of annihilation next month we'll be
tales from the borderlands steamworld
dig to Kingsway Tokyo 42 and dub Wars
much like humble bundles I would be
surprised if these stay awesome and it
will ok it also looks kind of like
they've got one more headliner game in
each one and then some other ones which
may or may not be cool but I'm not super
familiar with them twitch Prime is
included with Amazon Prime by the way so
I mean I already would have recommended
an Amazon Prime membership so I guess I
recommended a little tiny bit more yeah
um at the same time if you don't want
the entire world to be taken over maybe
consider not by Broadcom is not buying
Qualcomm anymore because the US
government blocked it it's official and
SpaceX is trying to reach Mars in 2019
though SpaceX cool thanks for watching
the land show see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel
the web show like 40 minutes of one
thing and then like Hello by the way
some other stuff like the the timestamps
this week are gonna be like four things
Wow we had a lot of viewership this vid
you should like you guys super all
twitch viewers you guys super excited
for the super click baby thumbnail and
title on youtube go to LTX yeah oh he
didn't do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
