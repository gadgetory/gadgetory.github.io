Server today we're gonna be having a
look at remote access so remote access
allows you to access all of your files
so I'm gonna go ahead and type in my
email address I already have this set up
cuz I have my own home server but it's
all the same to you guys I'm just gonna
keep my email address on the down-low
I accidentally revealed it in one of my
previous episodes and about 300 million
people added me to MSN Messenger
I apologize for ignoring those people
but it's just not not something that I
want to necessarily have all over my
well yeah all over my msn I keep it
strictly to friends and family so
alright here we go the domain name is
setup I just entered my Windows Live ID
I already had it set up there was only a
couple extra steps it's fairly
self-explanatory to do this so I've gone
ahead and set it up my router is fairly
able to configure that on its own so
here we go we're gonna simulate what
it's like to run Windows Home Server
through the internet browser it only
works with Internet Explorer 4 remote
desktop connection so if you don't like
Internet Explorer then too freaking bad
but you can use other browsers including
Firefox is the one that I use myself and
that one I have tested to work with the
remote folder access so I'm gonna go
ahead type in my strong password so here
you go we're in the interface for a
Windows Home Server so I'm gonna go
ahead and click computers so from here I
can oh yeah you'll have to install an
ActiveX control so basically I'm just
gonna explain what this does you can
either connect to your home server which
just takes you to the home server
console this thing or you can connect to
your PC so as long as you configure your
pcs to work with remote desktop
connection and they are running a
supported operating system it's just
that easy you just double click on it
and you are running the remote desktop
connection to you
computer the next one is shared folder
so this one is also just terrific like
let's say you you get to school and you
realize the project that you worked on
that you aren't very smart and you store
in the expendable folder so here let's
go put a project in the expendable
folder let's say that project is an EI
download manager so we go ahead and
let's go to the TS mini go to the
expendable folder no can't find the
expendable folder for some reason
heavens ok let's throw it in the public
folder fine whatever ok so let's go back
to Internet Explorer oh it's probably
because it's open here oh well so we'll
go to the public folder oh no I forgot
it oh it's ok I can save it to my
desktop yay so it's not easy you can
just access all your folders like that
you can browse the whole structure the
whole folder structure so I could go
into my Linus folder I haven't actually
got anything in there but let's go back
to my public folder so you can actually
check a bunch of different stuff that
you want you can choose icon view or
details view you can show all files you
can show 20 or 50 it gets kind of slow
if you're home internet connection isn't
very fast and you're trying to show all
files and like some huge folder so I
wouldn't really recommend that but if
you have any idea what you're looking
for you can usually find it in the list
if not you can only search for it and it
does work very very well so that is yet
another killer feature of Windows Home
Server that I absolutely love and it
basically sets itself up if you have a
reasonably current router</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
