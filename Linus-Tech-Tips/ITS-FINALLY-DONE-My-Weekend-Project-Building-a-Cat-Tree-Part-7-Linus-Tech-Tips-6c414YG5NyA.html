finally finished we added it up and it
was probably about 50 labor hours all
told to put this thing together so you
can see that it is now completely
carpeted so here I'll give like a quick
tour of the cat condominium that has
been constructed here so this bottom bit
is actually still missing a piece
there's going to be a ramp going from
this door down to the edge here but we
haven't put the ramp on yet it's just a
small small thing in the grand scheme of
things oh there's a cat in there but I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
see him anyway okay so we've got the the
lower platform here then there's a house
in the middle with a couple of doors one
on each side and then a couple of our
three windows and then from there they
can either climb these sisal covered
poles or sit on the platform about the
on the in the mid level here then
there's another house so the penthouse
is up at the top here and then we've got
this is like another woven sisal pillar
so that's going to be primarily for
scratching and then there's two more
platforms up at the top and then from
there we can hang like you know little
mouse toys or you know little silvery
shiny balls and hopefully entice the
cats to come up and attack them let's
see I got one kind of eyeing me here
here he comes there you go so so far
it's a big hit with them sprayed catnip
all over it so hopefully we can get them
to use it but yeah overall cost of this
project including some carpet from end
to the roll I ordered some sisal remains
from another online shop ah yeah so
about 50 labor hours and then about 350
or so dollars so it wasn't cheap but to
actually buy something like this at the
store I went around to all of the local
pet stores and they had stuff that was
maybe about as high as just this house
and just
really poorly constructed it seems so
shoddy and they were asking 250 to 350
bucks for it so I'm pretty glad that I
worked on my own here anyway thank you
for those who have been following along
with all of my cat tree stuff and thank
you for those who don't care about it
and have been patient with me as I
complete this project yeah I know not
everyone likes the cat videos but you
know what are you gonna do my cats are
playing on it so I thought I'd get a
short video showing how much they liked
it and maybe better for how much this
thing cost and how long it took to build
let's see if I can get him to chase the
laser pointer someone's gotta go for it
come on guys it's amazing how well they
can climb it now that it's all covered
in carpet and in the sisal fabric there
we go can you taste it all the way up
there there you go yeah these guys just
love it though which is really good I'm
glad it wasn't a total waste of time you
thanks for that cover your shame
they can just really climb on this thing
now they'll climb to even right up onto
the top of the poles sometimes can you
jump there yes you can
so cute
I don't think I actually did a shot
showing the whole thing in the house so
that's it next to the fireplace for sale
it's kind of ridiculous but yeah we're
pretty happy with this so it's all good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
