the LGG 8 but the reality of it is that
most phones are pretty much the same
thing I look at a couple of key gimmicks
these days anyway so we figured what the
hey why don't we just do a phone gimmick
video instead focusing on of course the
big gimmick of the g8 the rear
fingerprint sensor just kidding that was
what the g2 anyway no the screen that
actually vibrates to make forward-facing
sound yes my friends there's no speaker
on the way though you think that's the
biggest gimmick there's worse it gets
bigger than that and stay tuned and
you'll find out just how after this

description
so do you want to show off the weird
vibrating screen speaker first or the
hand on lock first I want to do the
vibrating screen first when you heard
that this phone had that feature did you
assume that it had no other speakers and
no other holes I did and then I got
really confused because as soon as I sat
here and you put it on the table I was
like woah hold on a second it's got
speaker holes in the bottom and making
matters even more confusing it doesn't
even seem like it's a good speaker
solution because it's the old-fashioned
fire into your palm and you know curve
your palm real nice so you can actually
hear anything thing like there's
actually no speaker at the table the
exciter is right about here kind of
right where that Google search bar is it
is meant to be a top speaker even though
it does kind of shake the whole screen
let's put some sound on you can might be
able to hear that it's louder at the top
and the bottom I would say the stereo
effect on this is far less convincing
than even like a really a really small
amplified earpiece speaker like what
I've got on the note 9 it's you can
really tell like where it's coming from
and it's especially because you've got
that downward firing one into your hand
it's like kind of out here yes and then
this one is like here so it's almost
like a weird offset like if you were to
take your projector screen and put one
of your speakers well behind it and then
one of them way over on the side like
it's not a proper stereo effect and it's
really quiet the other issue here is
that this phone just doesn't sound very
good I'm not only 7080 percent right now
and there's clear Distortion okay
compare that to a pixel 3 that has dual
front firing speakers in stereo yeah
like it crushes it but I bet you can go
higher without Distortion
a little bit okay hold on let me crank
this though
it's ugly the phone really vibrates
noticeably in your hand so what I'm
trying to figure out though is whether
that's from the vibrating screen aspect
or if it's from the boombox speaker
thing so the g7 the phone that came
before this had these boombox speakers
so they actually utilize some of the
space of the phone as an acoustic
resonance chamber for the speaker so
they actually hollowed out some aspect
of this and that vibrated your hand on
the g7 even though there was no
vibrating screen it's actually kind of
unpleasant and it's really unfortunate
because my first impressions of the g8
are honestly really good like I like the
really natural curve they've got for the
glass back here I really like the
rounded corners down here it fits nicely
in the hand it's not gigantic so if
you're the kind of person who doesn't
want like a frickin tablet in your
pocket then it's it's actually like it's
still one handable you know like I can
actually type on this with one hand it's
got glass on the sides now and look what
they did this isn't even improvement
compared to the g7 as they managed to
have no more bump no camera bump at all
oh it felt really sleek but I couldn't
put my finger on why oh okay well now we
got to try a phone call then yes because
there's another aspect that is
potentially awesome which is it's
somewhere between speaker and bone
conduction speaker apparently they say
if you're in a noisy environment you can
just put it closer to your jaw and you
can hear better than you can with a
normal phone okay so we figure what
better way to create a noisy environment
than to just crank something on our
brand-new okay it's not all set up but
it should still make noise home theater
setup this is still a home theater if
it's at work so this is bizarre I could
hold my phone right here like some kind
of freaking moron and I can still hear
this pine that's pretty cool all right
now let's introduce some noise pollution
let's say you go to Hawaii
okay come on back in so that's
impressive I actually wasn't that
convinced again while I was trying to
hold the phone to my ear at the top like
I would be in the habit of doing but
then once I actually put my ear sound
absorption hole right here where the
actual exciter is I was able to even
after he turned it back up I was able to
hear you quite clearly so are you saying
that it's not great for consuming
content but I can for calls it's pretty
sweet actually
yeah I'd say that's that's really fair
if you actually take a lot of phone
calls in crowded environments cuz you
could hear me pretty well - yeah that's
impressed I was literally standing next
to speakers with obnoxious music like
the epitome of obnoxious music playing
so I think as long as you have the right
expectations then you might be impressed
with this because I thought it was gonna
be awesome sound and no speakers and
that's what I thought based on the TV
demos and that's not even the most
gimmicky gimmick though right they claim
that you can unlock the phone with your
palm it's like with my Palm Pilot
I can remote into it and unlock it
uh-huh does anyone even get who's gonna
get that no one something so they put
one of those time of flight sensors on
the front of this which is what face IDs
all go and this does have face on lock
which is sweet but for some reason the
feature you never knew you didn't want
you can also use your hand to unlock it
you can now unlock your phone with hand
ID in theory you did it did it yeah do
it again okay
I've never got two in a row
yeah
so it's not fast though yeah an under
screen fingerprint sensor is clearly a
better solution with that said the one
plus 60 is fast but the ultrasonic
sensor wrong phone not impressive to me
so far check this out it might as well
be an iPhone 6 it might as well be hand
unlock it's our new punch line for LG
hand game
everything's gate with this thing
vibrating screen gate ok ok so lucky you
it unlocks for you that's great now that
actually has other features that you can
do with your hand
other than unlocking it they're called
air motion gesture sounds terrible air
motion try holding your hands 6 to 10
centimeters away 6 to 10 shooting let me
get that dialed right in for you ok
don't pretend like you aren't intimately
familiar with that line ok so you see
that green bar that came up yeah ok now
move your hand
20 centimeters away ok now you're
supposed to be able to like swipe to
start an app or pinch for pinch for a
screen shots like that like a duck but
it's supposed to be giving you a preview
where it kind of images your hand and
you can see what your hand is doing but
it's not even giving you the preview
anymore
oh wait why isn't the preview coming up
if the bar is coming up I can't take
this anymore and then the last unusual
feature is that portrait mode now
instead of just having stills capture
and the ability to change your
background blur let me just blur you
somewhere here now it also has video
mode yeah this is not good like you add
some Twitter compression to this and you
are looking at a pretty bad time it's
almost a shame that those gimmicky
features suck because underneath all
that is like a pretty decent phone
Snapdragon 855 six gigs ram 128 gigs ROM
there's just the one SKU it's got IP 68
water resistance it's got a headphone
jack including LG's hole 32 pit HiFi
quad DAC thing they've actually got a
pretty good reputation for their analog
sound output it's got USB type-c 3,500
milliamp hour battery there's actually
not a lot to complain about here 6.1
inch display it's just like it feels
like the same thing I've been saying for
the last I don't know five years eight
years however long it's been about these
about phones really is like yeah it's
like pretty good except that they try to
write their own software instead of just
using Android and they apparently do
that so that they can build in these
weird features that mostly don't work
the speaker I mean it's not better than
a phone that you know just has a a
single bottom firing speaker but that
was the norm not that long ago and it
has the benefit of being able to use in
a crowded environment and not have to
like fuss around with you know holding
your phone in exactly the right spot so
that's pretty cool this thing though can
just disappear
for all I care I'd recommend it if it
wasn't running LG's skin that will
always be a problem for me it's actually
looks like they've made a lot of
improvements here to be perfectly honest
with you the icons are not ugly I don't
LG's skin it's better than Samsung's
well the way Samsung's was before it
recently improved it also pricing and
availability this will be out in the
next coming weeks depending on your
carrier for about probably 800 bucks
the g7 was 750 so it's a flagship it's
not the most expensive phone out there
if it's a good deal on contract with
your carrier normally these sponsor
spots are pretty long but I'm gonna save
