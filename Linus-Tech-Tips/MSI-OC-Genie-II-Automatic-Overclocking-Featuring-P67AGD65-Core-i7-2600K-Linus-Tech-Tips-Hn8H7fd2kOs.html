voyage of discovery episode of my video
blog I have the p67 AGD 65 which I was
able to manually tune in and overclock
of 4.7 gigahertz on my core i7 2600
msi asked me to try out their OC Genie 2
button so this is their one button
overclocking I press the button I'm
pressing the power switch and now we're
going to find out how close you can get
to my manually tuned overclock by just
pressing that button on your MSI
motherboard so first of all we're gonna
boot up I've already set the hard drive
to a HCI mode in the bile so hopefully
that is still Moses fare OC Genie is
enabled it's not recommended to change
anything in the BIOS menu but changing
the the mode of your SATA controller is
probably still okay so I'm going to go
ahead and do that just to make sure that
what's the wrong thing it's under
advanced it's under integrated
peripherals yep so we're still at HTI
mode so we didn't reset that I'm going
to press f10 and restart and let's find
out what OC Genie has set this chip - so
we're gonna boot into Windows and that's
probably going to take a minute or so so
maybe I'll talk about military class -
while we wait so military class - highly
conductive polymerized capacitors up to
eight times the lifespan of a regular
solid capacitor Super ferrite choke is
30% higher current capacity than a
standard traditional choke and then
solid capacitors give you ten plus years
ultra long lifetime yeah it's not doing
anything yet okay camera man's telling
me I should pay attention to the screen
but it's not doing anything
so they're saying up to ten plus years
of lifetime under full load so that's
assuming you're gaming for 12 years
straight without sleeping which some
wild players could probably do so there
you go that could be a realistic usage
scenario for some people okay we're boot
it up into Windows yay
okay so I've explained this a few
times in the past it always asks me to
reactivate every time I change hardware
so I don't really bother to activate
anymore
so what we're going to do is we're going
to lob cpu-z and see what we're running
at because I actually have no idea
so at idle we are running at 3.5
gigahertz so that's a multiplier of 35
with OC GE turned on okay
and then let's see what happens if we
run eight threads of prime95
really I wonder if I'm doing it wrong
this really doesn't seem very OCD okay
gimme a minute and I will find out what
is going on here so this is me actually
using a manual so I'm gonna see if
that'll tell me anything about how to
enable OC Genie properly because as far
as I can tell I haven't done it right oh
so there's no CG software application
okay so that's the only thing in there
so keep I'll keep checking manuals and
I'll let you guys know I figure anything
out here okay so we're sort of trying to
figure out what's going on here it says
here that you can disable the OC Genie
function in the BIOS setup which I
haven't done so we're here in the BIOS
now and what the BIOS is telling me is
that we are overclocked right now
including the RAM it's loaded in XMP
profile all on its own it's increased
the CPU voltage it's increased the RAM
voltage and in theory we're running at
4.2 gigahertz of adjusted CPU frequency
so while you sit okay we don't really
need to use msi control center oops I
right clicked instead of left click here
why don't we set that to enable just in
case that makes a difference so we're
going to save our BIOS profile and reset
so in theory OC Genie is working
and we're going to boot up in just a
moment so that was me using a manual
you'll probably never see this on tech
tips again and I am pretty sure you've
never seen it before but there it is so
what are they claiming so they're
claiming OC g OC Genie enabled gives you
up to 36 percent in performance increase
on the integrated GPU although I don't
think that actually works on p67 at
least that's my understanding
camera man's like giving me a funny look
right now I've really run out of things
to talk about it's okay though cuz we're
in the bassinet or we in the bio
screaming guys now okay so let's fire up
cpu-z and see if magically by rebooting
once there okay it works now so there
you go so 4.2 gigahertz is what we're
running at I'm assuming if we run eight
thread so we're stressing out four cores
to the max and now let's see what
happens if we go ahead and do something
like say for example we run to tortured
test threads of small FFT let's see if
it is leaving Intel turbo boost enabled
or if it's going for a straight
overclock so it looks like MSI has gone
very conservatively here they're
actually giving it about as much voltage
as I gave it to reach four point seven
gigahertz stable but it's better to go
conservative and assume that some chips
won't overclock as well as others when
you're doing like a one button
overclocking method like this versus
having it take it to the limits so there
you go OC Genie took us about half of
the way there compared to manually
overclocking but I would still recommend
a manual overclock versus a canned
overclock in this case so thank you for
checking out my video blog don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings guides reviews and videos and
whatnot now you should look at the OC
Genie but that's what we're talking
about
good work cameraman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
