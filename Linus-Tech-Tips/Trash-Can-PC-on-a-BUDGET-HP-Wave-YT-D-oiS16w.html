Apple does something and then everyone
else goes hmm that's a pretty good idea
and as the same thing three years later
for a fraction of the cost
meet the latest member of the club
the HP wave a trashcan PC starting at
600 bucks
enjoy VR without obstacles with ZOTAC
s-- VR go backpack which features a gtx
1070 and intel core i7 processor learn
more at the link below so what exactly
is this thing
well HP's slogan is a desktop PC
designed to be seen so we'll mark it on
its looks first at nine and a quarter
inches high and close to seven inches
wide in a rounded triangular shape it's
very small for a desktop with this much
Hardware inside and features a grey
fabric wrap around the outside that
looks really modern but doesn't draw
unnecessary attention that is assuming
you can find somewhere to stash the
unsightly power brick so it is pretty
but can it perform actually the specs
are not bad our core i7 model sports a
power optimized lifestyle CPU whatever
that means
which basically trades some performance
for lower heat and power consumption
it's got a good mix of solid state and
spinning storage and a functional if not
4k triple-a gaming ready GPU curiously
HP's website says up to 16 gigs of RAM
but as far as we can tell there's no way
to order such a beast so you might have
to upgrade it with one of those empty
slots yourself noise is probably the
biggest downside of the wave which peaks
at 50 decibels and a whopping 86 degrees
on the CPU under load though
that in itself isn't the biggest problem
even short bursts of activity like
installing a program make the fan wind
up then wind back down and this
irregular fluctuation in the sound
quality makes it very hard for the wave
to blend in with background noise which
isn't to say there isn't any reason you
couldn't try to drown it out in a bit of
an unusual move HP has integrated a
speaker into the tower it sounds best at
about half volume which is loud enough
for background music at a small dinner
party but not for movie watching and
sports half-decent bass although it
suffers as sounds get more complex
everything I am by Kanye sounds right at
home but busier tracks such as LCD
Soundsystem's Daft Punk is playing at my
house get muddled and a bit messy a
problem that is exacerbated by the fact
that the speaker's output grille is also
the exhaust vent for the cooling
solution to look inside the wave all we
needed to do was remove three screws and
from here the RAM and three and a half
inch storage harddrive are easily
accessed for upgrades but an m2 SSD swap
would be much more difficult
totally disassembled we can see why the
thermal performance was a little
lackluster system cooling is handled by
these copper heat pipes that lead to a
small heatsink with a single blower
style fan for airflow even compared to a
stock intel heatsink it's a little
anemic looking and it's responsible for
the video card as well not that it's a
super powerful one or anything the wave
isn't made for gaming and it shows but I
still give HP credit for including more
than onboard graphics
rise of the Tomb Raider on the lowest
settings at 720p ran at a playable 40
fps and eSports games like dota csgo or
overwatch will run fine as long as you
manage your expectations and you don't
try to play them with the included
wireless keyboard and mouse
they're functional and it's neat that
they don't require any setup thanks to
the receiver that's zip tied to an
internal USB port but they're possibly
actually worse than what you'd expect
for included peripherals in a starting
at $5.99 computer I'd replace the
keyboard immediately if I intended to do
any serious word processing work and the
mouse is unusual kind of sonic the
hedghog profile shape didn't fit the
hand of anyone that I showed it to so
yeah but while at this point in the
video you might be thinking gee he sure
doesn't like this thing very much
truthfully I wasn't that stoked on it
until I tried to find something that
outcompetes it and if you want a
reasonably high performance little
machine thermals and acoustics aside
it's very functional it powered through
productivity image editing watching 4k
content and even light video work and it
does it without taking up a lot of space
or looking ugly in your apartment or
your studio for competing trashcan PCs
there's really not much else out there
the Mac Pro is in a totally different
class using workstation hardware at five
times the price the msi vortex is
similarly much more expensive and the
extra $700 you'd be giving Samsung for
an art PC seems to be going towards an
aluminum chassis and easy storage
expansion and for that kind of money you
could swap a 10 terabyte Seagate
enterprise hard drive into the wave and
still have enough left over for 436
Chicken McNuggets even looking beyond
trash cans it's very competitive a
similarly Specht laptop will cost you an
additional 200 bucks which is enough to
cover a monitor and a replacement
keyboard for the wave and many many pcs
were either much less powerful or
clearly made with gaming in mind
sacrificing some processor speed and
generally looking well let's just say
