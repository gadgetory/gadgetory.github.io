for you I'm always the one who announces
the rules but I don't know what they are
Colton no no internet how are we
supposed to build a computer with no
internet they've got two thousand
dollars to build the best bang for the
buck PC but they have to do it without
internet they've got three days to do it
and on the fourth day we find out who
the winner is in this edition of
scrapyard Wars brought to you by D brand
okay so the one way that you can benefit
from the Internet
is if you ask someone a question and
without any prompting they use the
internet to find the answer for you I'm
at a complete loss right now because I
know a lot of people will look at the at
the amount of money I'm holding and
they'll go well that's easy but what's
not easy is bang for the buck I can't
spend it all I have to shop as though I
have as close to zero of it as possible
if we need a paper map it's us up to us
to go get one which is actually slightly
problematic because I don't know where
the heck you buy one I think I'm just
gonna get in the car and start driving
basically the only places that I know
how to get to our BCIT Kwantlen
technically but I don't know if they
have computer courses there and best buy
because other than that I pretty much
use GPS to get everywhere and I can't
now not even the not on the internet GPS
in my car thanks thanks rules I rarely
think of like using Google Maps as using
the internet but I can't use Google Maps
oh I can't I don't know how to find
anything YouTube yep I genuinely hope
you do quite well because one of us need
something thanks dear and nice guys nice
guys deep brand
well I didn't think it would be like
this it didn't occur to me that I
couldn't use email I actually kind of
wonder how necessary the map is because
I'm not gonna be able to find anywhere
that I don't already know okay so the
girl in there was really helpful they
don't carry street maps anymore but she
did have this handy-dandy printed map of
the local area which I guess is better
than nothing like I really appreciate
the help but I do have to wonder what
the purpose of this is they've got their
locations circled and highlighted but
who are they giving this to they're out
there already here thought process right
now is I've found a few terrible ideas
at BestBuy but the guys there were
really helpful and they did what they
could and we have some options okay so
potential idea that it's a little low
spec but it's really cheap because I
think it's been like in an open it was
an open box return from like a long time
ago that's just been sitting in the back
300 watt power supply 810 7800 8
gigabytes of ddr3 the power so I would
need to be cranked up because I need to
put a graphics card in there
it's really cheap we're gonna try a
little bit more sneaker networking I'm
gonna go to be CIT my old University and
Brandon's old University I'm really
hoping I can find someone carrying like
a gaming laptop or something like that
that is a big goal approaching random
people has been difficult for me mainly
because I don't want to be a burden on
people or annoy them I'm certain that
won't bother Linus at all okay so I got
this street map of the entire Fraser
Valley for $6 crap excuse me this might
be a bit of a long shot I see you're
cleaning up though do you happen to have
a phone book yeah no phone book okay I
was worth a shot
what about an old computer are you
selling any computer stuff okay was
worth a shot thank you Duff that is the
most desperate feeling thing I think
I've ever done there is a very distinct
possibility that I am going to end up
having to go to a computer store and buy
a computer
what does geeks are us let's find out
what geeks RS is here there's no parking
way to go geeks are us more like losers
with no parking spaces are us hi
all right good what kind of a store is
this exactly I was just driving by
computer repairs do you guys deal in
used hardware at all I mean we're both
like 2nd gen core i7 3rd gen it was a
sure when I get more desperate I might
get to the point of just going to
computer stores and asking people there
but that's like pretty rude to make a
deal with me under the table
on some stuff that they own on the side
like that's the kind of thing that they
would keep on the on the DL on the CL
you know even if it's like something you
have personally I'll deal under the
counter anything I'm desperate ok so
what would be what would be fair pricing
for these I'll leave it up to you know
oh yeah it's it's up to you guys
honestly I would give it to you if you
write we can't we can't take it from you
I mean the i-5 6400 you wouldn't give
that away you can't get a word for it
it's useless to us so here's the
situation these guys have some older
used stuff but they don't have pricing
for anything because this is all in the
like put it in a bin and take it to free
geek once a quarter pile so I think what
we're probably gonna have to do is keep
exploring but this was a solid lead
unfortunately the best graphics card
they've got that's not a Quadro is a 77
70 and I think that might be a little
bit underpowered for our purposes okay
thank you very much this has been very
helpful I'm okay literally we have a
wall of bins all the babes they just can
I see the wall of bin okay
you know this is where you keep your
memories our memories I have been for my
memories too you know got everything
server parts okay do you mind if I just
poke around a little bit excuse me a
really random question so I noticed
you're working on a laptop that wasn't a
Mac I just wanted to ask if you or
anyone you know are trying to sell any
computer parts okay thank you much I'm
working on a project right now which is
like a competition where I have to build
the computer sure I'm not allowed to use
the internet to find any of the parts
and I can't buy them from traditional
brick-and-mortar stores I have the case
and if I still have the case but I do
have the RAM just had to find it I never
needed to go to the IT desk we talked to
the first guy behind the IT desk food
yeah has some stuff at home that he's
looking to get rid of which is hilarious
he had some ram in a case which is
unfortunately like in the lowest section
of things that I need right now but I
have his number he's gonna contact me
when he figures out what that stuff is
and maybe maybe he'll know someone else
who has some more things as well
apparently I do be CIT as a whole just
finished their finals last week and is
currently in like
marking time or whatever so it's
basically just teachers here so plan a
right now is to go to a bunch of
different repair shops self repair shops
laptop repair shops stuff like that and
try to see if they might know anyone or
they themselves outside of that work
have some computer components that I can
buy scrapyard Wars is brought to you by
D brand their new Nintendo switch cantar
available now and you can also order
along with like horrible these are cute
you can also order tempered glass screen
protectors these little kits come with
everything you need they look great and
they're durable including fantastic
scratch resistance you can learn more at
the link in the video description ok so
here's a 1366 Zeon now the problem is
that it's an e 50 607 whatever that is
no internet I don't know I've been
conditioned by the much higher quality
of information on the Internet to not
bother to ask people in stores
therapists what if I showed up with an
APU as long as I could run fortnight at
1080p that could be an excellent value
so they've got an a-10 5800 series not
sure exactly what chip it is here's some
ddr3 though that's potentially
interesting so this is a 4 gig 2 by 2
kit and it looks like they've got a
couple of them okay well you know what
this has been very helpful gentleman and
we may return I'm assuming a motherboard
in this bin is dead they're going to
salvage are there
okay thank you very much gentlemen it's
possible that I'll return my options are
somewhat limited how did people get the
word out about things before the
internet signs
let's go decorate my car selling selling
your I can't do like block letters I
wasn't paying attention in that class in
grade four you know I have literally
never done this before this is just
based on watching other people do it no
I'm not want to buy right my plan for
the next few days is to try to come up
with a better plan than this now I don't
think it's enough to have this on the
inside it's kind of hard to read through
the dick but so I'm gonna put it on the
outside of the car I'm gonna tape it on
to the back window was there any doubt
that I was gonna go full moron it just
shut up I'm working on it okay okay this
might have been ill-advised
that's not going anywhere
let's go find a phone book it seems like
a total long shot but you guys have a
phone book
I know right got a bit of a long shot
question the other phonebook I'm your
neighbor from about six stores down long
shot questions you guys have a phone
book Hey long shot question do you guys
have a phone book it is amazing how hard
it is to find a phone book I was laughed
at literally laughed at do you have one
you can't say yes it Toby don't that's
not the art of negotiation would say you
guys are savages
okay ed are our good neighbors cover
star thank you very much I can bring it
back in four days Oh
I mean this feels like a total shot in
the dark but video production services
if I can find an old workstation holy
crap there's a listing for industrial
vibrators
you've dialed a number Oh four to would
not be a good start here yeah I don't
think that's awful video productions any
work hi this is a bit of a random
question but do you guys have any old
workstations that you're looking to get
rid of like for money I would pay for
them like you guys do video work right
oh never mind thank you you're under
video production services in the Yellow
Pages so I figured yeah okay that makes
sense thank you bye okay here's a post
house they will have powerful
workstations for sure I mean do this
many businesses just disappear hi um
this is a bit of a long shot question
but do you guys have any like PC gaming
stuff systems did you know anyone like
even if it's not willow video who has
some gaming hardware that they might
want to get rid of okay I'll give that a
shot thank you okay crazy Bob downtown
Langley okay let's try some pawn shops
I've never had luck with these before
though but the thing about pawn shops hi
I was wondering if you guys have any
computers or a computer hardware laptop
say do you have anything like gaming
grade
I know really I tell my seven quad core
with 16gb memory okay and what what are
you guys asking for that one okay that's
that's pretty rough
okay okay all right that might be
outside of my budget thank you very much
okay right yeah oh I legitimately just
looked you up in the yellow pages I'm
just looking for a workstation I thought
people who work on video editing might
have old workstations
we have workstations but how would he
call me back the Yellow Pages is
worthless it deserves to be dead how can
this many places be closed what if I
wore a shirt that said I want to buy a
gaming PC and then people would walk up
to me want to buy I mean it's not the
worst thing I've ever done it's a pretty
little bar though oh you can't even read
it
it's like way over under probably not
gonna tape it put it back I already look
like enough of an idiot okay
so we've only got like an hour and a
half left so we're gonna check out the
local community center to see if we can
get a list of events around here that
maybe would attract nerds in the next
couple of days and then we're gonna go
to crazy Bob's because apparently
according to willow video they have
stuff sometimes getting stuff in and out
of the backseat is
gonna be a bit of a hassle now yeah so
back when I used to paint houses this
was how I used to drive with my hands at
nine and three on the steering wheel
because that's what they taught me in
driving school
this is the worst I've want the internet
back I think this is like really old
because there's an overpass in front of
us that straight up is not on our map Oh
check out the other path I need that how
am I supposed to know where I'm going
you can't operate a camera and defend
this map at the same time I think we are
about to have a no internet experience
here because I don't know where exactly
crazy Bob's is I don't immediately see
it and I think I'm going to have to ask
for directions this seems like a really
long shot so while I do really
appreciate them trying to help a brother
out I I do not have a lot of confidence
that this is gonna yield anything you
can just wait here and I don't think
this is a thing I feel like an idiot in
this shirt I'm taking it off wow they
have like everything here you know like
army of Darkness paraphernalia you know
like that kind of story there's a
community donation center here there's a
thrift store and there's a Value Village
this is the editor viewer dual 8 I think
this is a film viewer
here's another thrift store electronics
section da doo 6 bucks I'm buying it
this for me personally though this has
nothing to do a scrap yard worse whoa
what is this oh oh it's just a heat sink
I thought this was a CPU that would have
been unbelievable
so I'm feeling pretty good I got myself
a PlayStation 2 controller and a lead on
an LGA 2011 box heatsink so I was gonna
just leave this here tonight but I need
to get my badminton stuff out of my
truck yes I should have just done it on
poster board ed thank you you captain
hindsight all hindsight now a big thing
that I learned today is that the entire
market for used computer stuff has moved
online it's a high tech category so it
makes total sense that the people
selling and the people buying would take
the whole thing online deep brand is
your source for awesome vinyl skins and
now you can finally skin your Nintendo
switch your switch accessories and your
switch controllers including the pro
controller they use high quality
authentic true textured 3m vinyl on
every product they feature unrivaled
precision so no matter what colour you
like your joy Kahn's to be me personally
I'm partial to the pink and purple
combination they are going to look
absolutely fantastic like a factory
finish and their customer service robots
are easy to work with and wonderful
their products are affordable they ship
worldwide so check them out today at the
link below your switch could look like
this or like this or like this or this
look they have so many colors let's see
if I can juggle new brand new brand joy
cones
oh yes I can
whatever it's d-branes joy cones oh
newsflash for dbrand you guys are like
super not getting these pro controllers
back these look awesome
next time on scrapyard wars I don't want
them to lose money either like I'm not
in the business of just screwing people
over I don't want to be like I don't
want to be rude or anything but like
that's not worth anywhere near the
sticker like not even close a fraction
of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
