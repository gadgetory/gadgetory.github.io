like top five gaming desktop set the
intel booth the answer is yes yes it
would but this is good too so we're
gonna start with a system that was done
up by our buds over at BS mods now he's
got to include those guys because their
systems are always so gorgeous so in
this case get it case they started with
the case labs sm8 they got the just
primed version so that they could put
their trademark automotive grade finish
on this puppy I mean what do they not
put a beautiful automotive grade finish
on in terms of specs that has some
beautiful Hardware so we got a core i7
59 60 X that's of course supporting quad
channel ddr for which we have 32 gigs of
from corsair those are Dominator
Platinum's but they've done a lot of
little subtle customizations here those
black strips on the top of the Dominator
Platinum's the removal of the white
shroud on the x 99 deluxe motherboard to
make this look absolutely gorgeous and a
monochrome black and white and grey
color scheme we've got dual GTX 980 s
water cooled by EK water blocks along
with the CTU with that sick looking
mayim fluid inside but this machine is
really all about the SSDs and there are
a lot of SSDs in here we've got to 750
series SSDs plug directly into PCI
Express slots down there we have a third
plugged into a suit says hyper kit
coming off the motherboard there and
plugging in with the cable and then
mounted on like a showcase pedestal
stand and then as if that wasn't enough
the entire front of the case is full of
four more sata3 SSDs I mean I guess
that's you know that 730 series has been
you know fended off the mass storage
duties now as if they you know one point
whatever that is two terabytes of PCI
Express SSD wasn't enough what an
overkill bill but absolutely gorgeous
number two you don't have song that you
know I'm always singing I like little
builds they make me feel so good well
this one is a little tiny machine that
makes me feel pretty good i'm calling it
the lake fantastic fiber or something it
doesn't have a real name but exotic pc
did it up for the show they're actually
trialing a new
finish for the outside of the case you'd
hardly even recognized that this is a
corsair air 240 because they went they
put like automotive blue paint on it
then like some hydro something dip to
bring out this sort of faux carbon fiber
blue and silver finish and then they
clear coated it to give it shine and
durability looks absolutely fantastic
but of course none of that would be
meaningful if it didn't have the horses
under the hood and it does we've got a
maximus 8 gene motherboard so that's an
N ATX board in there with a core i7 6700
k processor of course that supports ddr4
memory so we got 32 gigs of course there
dominator platinum ddr4 and these gpus
they fit in there just barely you can
actually see if you look closely the
window is bowing from the manifold thing
sitting over top of both graphics cards
that puts parallel water flow through
them so they didn't get them in there
even if it was a bit of a tight fan of
course this is always a nice finishing
touch for me I mean mounting your SSD in
a dried sled is so like you know to
thousands it's 2015 mounted to the
window loving it nice touch number three
we've got the main gear force and this
is a boat as like you know cosmic
bowling as I think you can pretty much
get with a computer although as a fan of
the UV lighting effects myself I have to
say they've Prague taking a pretty novel
approach here so they've actually mixed
LED lighting for the green with blue
LEDs so they've got green LEDs around
the fans with these thermaltake fans as
well as illuminating the front panel and
then they've got blue LED strips on the
inside to illuminate the UV reactive
green fluid so you don't really see the
blue as more than just kind of like an
under glow to the foreground popping out
green lighting effect I think it looks
absolutely fantastic as you can clearly
tell its custom water-cooled win a
really really neat way so they've got
two pumps in the bottom let's split the
flow between the CPU and the GPUs and
then bring it all back together right at
the reservoir that screws right onto the
top of the dual pump unit and as always
it's got the horses under the hood so
it's azzie 170 deluxe for masseuse
with a core i7 6700 k we've got dual GTX
980 TI s it's got an ax 1200 I power
supply you might hardly recognize it but
this is a corsair 900d case and then
this is one of the few machines at the
show that features ah yes there it is
the Intel 750 series SSD but in the 1.2
terabyte variety I mean I guess that's
kind of cool I got one of my rig so you
know whatever I'm not that impressed but
they've definitely blown me away with
the looks of this machine because as
much as it might be that like you know
gamer over-the-top bling some of us are
into that sort of thing so yeah so it's
time for system number four and this one
is an absolute beauty it's actually in
the intel booth because it's running an
early build of karma incarnation one
like a moral choice point and click
adventure game but we're here for the
hardware anyway so we're going to focus
on this puppy cybertron has put this
beast of a machine and it's just
gorgeous aluminum and glass enclosure
from in wind that has all the fix let me
check this out it's got front USB type-c
i love that and it's going to touch them
to the button that I've accidentally
touched and turned off the game before
when I was trying to reposition to shoot
this video and of course it's got the
goods inside so we've got a core i7 6700
k water cooled by EK water blocks and
then we've also got dual GTX Titan
blacks we've got 32 gigs of ddr4 memory
from crucial we've got an EVGA power
supply of some sort it's like buried in
there in this very uniquely laid out
interior that has like a triple 120
millimeter radiator in the back and then
it's got like another fan here and then
all the water cooling tubing which is
hard pipe by the way looks beautiful is
like stealthily run up here and run
between all the components got another
dual 120 millimeter radiator and the
fronts got two more in takes on the
bottom and the thing is cooled to the
absolute nine then of course it's got
yes there it is an Intel 750 series 400
gig PCI Express SSD down there all on an
asus maximus eight ranger
man i love this like just slightly lit
but very dark like contrast he almost
like comic book ii looking color scheme
they got going on here just beautiful
system number five is something you
don't see from us very often this is a
tier one pre-built machine i mean those
suck right now this one looks pretty
darn interesting to me this is the acer
predator and while the look might be
quite polarizing it calls it the
armadillo but i think it looks more like
a the front of a tank tread or something
they've done a few things that are kind
of cool here so in your front with your
front i oh you got your SD card reader
your headphone microphone jacks to us p3
and boom what's that headphone holder
yeah that's right headphone holder right
in the front of the case uh okay fine
that's kind of bizarre ah you've got
your optical drive just in case you
still have one of those that's pretty
cool pop this baby down you got a hot
swap either three and a half inch or two
and a half inch sled so you can go ahead
and do a hard drive upgrade pretty
easily should you so desire we're just
going to leave that now this is where
things get really interesting on this
one it is almost impossible to get open
without instructions but of course I
managed it in fact one of the people
showing people around at the intel booth
was like yep i straight up don't know
how to get that out because it is kind
of weird in terms of its construction
it's like a normal acer case inside see
just like very normal case construction
and then it's actually got like a
gigantic body kit on it or something the
hardware inside is looking pretty good
though so we've got a core i7 6700 k
we've got a customs e170 micro ATX
motherboard so it's a acer acer special
in there we've got a gtx 970 it's a very
short looks like OEM only sku with a
blower design which is very nice for
cooling we've got I don't know 16 or 32
gigs of ddr4 memory and we've got a very
strange hard drive configuration for
terabyte sigue drive and a 3 terabyte WD
green so i guess the four terabytes
seagate is the boot drive well whatever
you'll be able to get into a variety of
different configurations i would
recommend one with an SSD and then get a
storage drive as well those are good but
boot off your
st and that's very interesting to see
Acer's take on the gaming desktop up
close and in person so I think that's
pretty much it guys thanks for checking
out our top five gaming desktops at the
intel booth here at PAX Prime 2015 don't
miss any of our pax prime coverage
because it's all freaking awesome I
haven't actually watched any of it yet
cuz like Luke did it and I haven't
watched it yet but I'm sure it's awesome
he does a good job oh and one thing I
missed it's got a turbo button bringing
back the 486 days yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
