ATI Eyefinity technology so we got the
back of a 58 70 there you can see we've
got three monitors plugged in so two are
using DVI and one of them is using
DisplayPort you must have a native
DisplayPort monitor or it will not work
now let's show the quick set-up guide
here on how to set up your triple
monitor display so you can see here
we've got three detected monitors so we
click on the little black triangle in
the corner and we're going to create a
group so we're going to create a group
that is three displays times one which
gives us an enormous ly wide desktop so
here we go now we've ended up with three
cloned displays which isn't quite what
we want but we're getting there so we're
going to exit there and then we'll go
back and now we can click on the
triangle again and we can go to the
properties for it now we've got some
pretty cool options for resolution in
here now so we're going to set it to 57
60 by 1200 so instead of treating this
like three separate monitors it's going
to treat it like one huge monitor in the
driver last thing we're going to need to
do because the order isn't right here my
Start menu is over here my clocks here
and then I have like some random long
taskbar here so we need to click on the
display group and then we're going to
arrange it so what you need to do is
find the blue display so you can see
here actually if I can cameramen zoom
out a little bit only one of the
displays is blue so I'm going to click
here the left one is blue now the blue
other blue one is on the right so I
click on the right and now that's gone
it arranged it in the correct order so
if I open up a program and maximize it
you can see it'll actually stretch
across the entire display so my close
buttons over here my start buttons way
over here thanks for checking out my
video blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
