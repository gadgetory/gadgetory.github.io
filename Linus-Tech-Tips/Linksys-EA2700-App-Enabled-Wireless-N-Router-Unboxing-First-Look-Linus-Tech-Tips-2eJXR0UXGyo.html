from Linksys by Cisco this is the
Linksys EA 2700 and apparently the
packaging is shiny so slick wants me to
get the plastic off of it pretty quickly
here which I struggle in to do the most
noteworthy thing about this guy is
pretty self-explanatory once you look at
the packaging app enabled so we're going
to go into what this means a little bit
more as soon as we see this box right
here HAP for iOS and Android devices to
manage your home network so basically
what this means is this and it's bigger
siblings the EA 3500 and the e a 4500
are capable of being managed remotely
using an app on your smartphone or your
tablet device so that means that if you
know Junior is working on a homework
assignment and the babysitter calls and
says blah blah blah the internet parent
ill you know protection turned off the
internet he still needs to do something
for another half hour you can actually
you know take you know subside at your
dinner like this and adjust the parental
settings on your router from the table
so you know make sure you know
everyone's cool with it before you go
and whip out your cell phone and be like
yeah I don't worry you guys are just
changing the router but as long as
people don't find it rude then you can
do it so it's a Wi-Fi home base I think
what they mean is wireless access point
and router and switch which is all the
stuff that's in here dual band n 600
router with gigabit so Wow gigabit ports
even on the lower end stuff now and will
abandon 6600 which means up to 300 plus
300 megabits per second speeds with 2.4
and 5 gigahertz dual band capability so
remember guys 5 gigahertz has lesser
range than 2.4 gigahertz but also
significantly less interference because
it's used a lot less extended range
gigabit ports parental controls and easy
setup easy setup really is a selling
point for these Linksys routers because
if you guys have seen the episodes that
we did on not remember what it was
called but it's on my NCIX tech tips
channel it's like Linksys advantage or
something like that we show how easy the
setup process is
yeah it's pretty compelling so if you
are not a networking expert for more
importantly if you are networking expert
because you're watching this channel so
you probably know a thing or two but
you're buying a router for someone who
is not a networking expert say for
example you know your mom who just got
an iPad like my mom just got an iPad no
now all of a sudden she needs Wireless
like okay but you want to put in
something that's simple enough that not
only can she use it but if she's having
trouble using it all you got to do is
without the smartphone be like yeah I
fixed it for you don't worry about it
mom I don't have to drive an hour to go
to your house to fix it
can you tell I've done this before okay
so here's the router unit itself it
looks just like their last generation
products so free sleek pretty simple
internal antenna not a big fan wish they
had an external antenna we've got a
heatsink going on in there got some
other doohickeys going on in there we
got little feet that are going to give
it a little bit of ventilation so you
put it down hold it up a little bit off
the surface because you can see these
are passive intakes and passive exhaust
all the way around the outside of the
unit there's your reset button right
there and these be like popped out or
something for like wall mounting
apparently not okay on the back of the
unit we find four Gigot gigabit ethernet
ports one internet port so that's the
one that you plug in to your modem as
well as a WPS button power indicator and
a power plug in terms of included
accessories there's not a whole lot
there's your power plug as well as one
Ethernet cable it is probably cat5 cat5e
another and finally any a series setup
CD start here run the CD first this is
one of the few instances where if you're
not a networking doing kind of guy or
you know you buy it for someone and you
don't want to walk them through every
step of it you just say put in the CD
it'll walk you through it and they
should be able to figure it out no
problem so thank you for checking out my
unboxing your first look at the EA 2700
dual band router which is app enabled
don't forget to subscribe - tech tips
from our boxing's reviews and other
computer videos sorry guys we actually
missed a couple things so simultaneous
dual band this is a concurrent dual band
wireless and ro
so that is up to 300 plus 300 megabits
per second you get the advantages of 5
gigahertz and the advantages of 2.4
gigahertz with expanded coverage and
reliability and it includes a damn
security quality-of-service
and finally it is ipv6 enabled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
