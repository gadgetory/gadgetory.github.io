XCOM alright guys I'm here at the
Silverstone booth with Tony and we were
to come we're here to check out some of
their home theater systems so this is
all htpc section earlier this year at
CES we showed off this very nice and
compact ml0 5 mini ITX HT VZ case so for
Computex we are showing the brother of
it is called an ml 0 6 it shares the
same basic internal structure as ml 0 5
except this front panel is now aluminum
instead of acrylic and plastic so moving
on we have a brand new case that we're
unveiling for Computex this year this is
a raven prototype mini case the reason
we put it here in the home theater
section is that we think this will be a
really nice complement for people to put
in their living room even though this is
designed for a gaming PC so inside if I
open this up you'll see that it has a
lot of features that will help you feel
a really powerful PC out of this so
first of all to make it small the case
use utilizes a mini ITX motherboard and
SFX power supply up front and here on
the right side this bracket if I remove
it you'll see it'll hold a graphics card
really long one two so that you can feel
really powerful system with this and on
the bottom of the chassis you can
actually fit a thin jewel 120 millimeter
radiator underneath that's awesome now
with with stuff like Steam big picture I
brought this up a few times here comfy
decks already but with stuff like Steam
big picture these kind of computers are
being such a big deal because everyone
wants to have seen big picture in their
home theater they want to use
controllers sit on that couch but play
PC games do PC games that what's up so
now if you could build an awesome system
in a case like this that looks really
sharp maybe not quite as professional
and amazing looking as an aluminum front
cover but if you can make
sharp good-looking gaming system to run
steam a picture that's great so this
case it's very cool we're gonna move on
and cover some more Silverstone stuff
alright we're still here at the
Silverstone booth we got something
really cool to check out which are SATA
power extensions and splitters this is
their previous one and so last year we
introduced Dave one two four house at
out connector so that it's got two
capacitive built in which we took a long
time to develop because you have to get
the right number of capacitor in the
right size for them to provide stable
enough power for all four connections to
your SATA drives one of the things that
people really like about this is that
they can use it on cases with the hard
drive cages that have multiple drives
fun some of those really smaller cages
users actually have to find that they
have to bend this cable rather stiffly
like this so why you end up with this
yeah you put your putting a lot of
stress on your SATA drives so this year
we're introducing these two new cables
so one is for two connections and one is
for four just like before but if you can
see we changed the material of the cable
to be very very soft and flexible so I
can bend it like this and it'll still
keep a very straight actually
stress-free reactor - it's actually
really cool because I personally I
haven't broken that much hardware but
I've broken a hard drive before by
having so much stress from the power
connector on it so now what I have to do
is I have to actually have the cable
pulled down by his app strap so that the
hard drive can actually be read from so
having more malleable cables like this
where you can move it around and torque
them a little bit and have no actual
issues it's very cool now we're gonna
move away from cables and go right over
to liquid coolers because these are
awesome my favorite part I'm gonna give
it to him pretty soon but my favorite
part is that they're all metal here it's
very sharp and shows true performance I
don't really like plastic in my system
at all I like full metal cases I like
full metal everywhere so that's awesome
what do you have to say about this okay
so we developed this in-house so
this one's a little beat up but you can
see just on the radiator design it's
different from any other water cooling
Raider on the market these use the same
type of heating ray of in this thing
fender a light high-end very high-end
air coolers that you see on the market
they're very tough it's very hard to
appendant if you've ever seen or used
other radiator so you'll know that if
you put a lot of pressure on them by
hand they've you actually penned the
fins but because these are designed more
like air coolers that they're not and
also they have much greater surface
contact with the water piping going
through the radiator than traditional
radiators designs and the second thing
that of course it's all water block it's
all metal so the bottom is copper this
main body here is unibody aluminum
that's though this is actually an older
version let's show the newer version
okay okay so this is no nickel nickel
plated so it looks very nice and even
the bracket here is although aluminum so
it's very very strong there's some flex
like the other middle brackets on the
market and this is soldered on the cover
bass solder on to the unibody as opposed
to screwed on like now the units on the
market you're not wasting any space with
screws it looks super sharp very very
high-quality build that's awesome so
when we first came by this computer I
had already seen their previous coolers
and he said just what guess what this
cooler doesn't have a pump at first I
thought he was kind of crazy maybe
misinformed maybe a lunatic I'm not
really sure but then I noticed that okay
I can see the water flowing it's not
actually rushing rushing rushing as fast
as you'd normally is where you can't
actually see the water flowing so I
started to believe him a little bit and
then he explained exactly how it doesn't
have a pump and I'm gonna let him do
that now okay so we're using a liquid
with the lower evaporation point
than normal so that means that he found
your CPU actually evaporate this liquid
causing this flow to go up and condenses
back down after it gets cool by the
radiator on top so what we can do now is
maybe turn off the computer so we can
show how much it changes so it's going
to turn off the computer there's still
gonna be residual heat on the CPU so
it's gonna take a little while for it to
slow down but you can probably already
tell that the rate at which the water is
flowing is slowing down it's still being
heated by the CPU the fan is already
stopped as you can see here so the
computer is off but you still it's still
going not super fast but still going
that's very cool this is the same style
of technology that is in air coolers and
systems already the heat pipes that you
have actually have a liquid in them and
it's evaporating and then coming back
down that's how it's moving heat into
the fins but I haven't seen this yet on
an actual liquid cooler so it's very
very cool thank you for showing us this
cooler we're gonna move on to some more
things
all right guys coming back at you from
the Silverstone booth we came over here
they've have a digital power power
splice this is in their Zeus series it's
a 1200 watt which is beast it's a
platinum which is beast but something
that's a little bit more interesting
about this is that it's digital so if
you can explain the UI we see here on
the screen and explain just how you can
change from single to quad which is
personally my favorite part ok so this
is a digital controlled power supply so
that means we could do everything
through the software interface here this
pulse applies the ability to change from
single rail so I have to just click here
and it becomes a single rail power
supply if I click on quad you can see
again all four rails
show up on 12 volt and because it's
digital control and that means you could
actually fine-tune each individual rail
like the 3.3 volts I could lower it or
increase it okay and hit OK to apply the
setting I can do this
for all of the rails from the power
supply also on the fan control we we
have this very simple to understand
interface you could choose any fan speed
points in which
you want to choose for your different
power loading levels so I can choose to
have a very strong fence be when the
powers are loading higher or I could go
really low on some of these power
settings power supplies have been that
interesting beast in your computer
because for so long you've been able to
change kind of whatever you want about
your computer except for the power
supply is just kind of sat down there
and done its job which is good but not
exactly what most people want we're hot
routers we want to be able to do
whatever we want so it's very cool to
see these digital power supplies coming
out where you can change anything on the
fly that's awesome we're gonna move on
all right so Nook has been around for a
little while or next unit of computing
but they've been not super interesting
at least in my opinion until someone
like silverstone has decided to come
around and just flip the whole thing on
its head now it's actually quite
interesting you can get a lot of
different options and we let you go
through it but these two are the ones
I'm mainly interested so far okay so
this is the PT 14 it's our first nut
case so this is designed with endless
operation in mind you can see already
help from the missing Finn look like top
cover yeah there's also a fan option on
the bottom where you can install as a
safety so if you're placing this nut
case in somewhere that you can touch
then obviously you won't have to spend
running to avoid CP running I mean see
be running a 60 or 70 degrees Celsius
actually okay for this okay so yeah but
not for your skin so if you want to put
this somewhere next to you you probably
want to have that fan running but if
you're putting this away maybe somewhere
behind a monitor like that over there
then it's probably okay for you to run
fin this right because you can mount
these on the back of monitors you can
mount them on the back of digital
signage and stores you run them on the
back of anything so that's pretty
awesome and for those of you that are
not not interested in using a feni's
case we also have a very beautiful
looking nut case that's just that can
utilize the regular intel floor cooler
on the Nook and this is really nice
looking as
that aluminum front panel is just
absolutely awesome aluminum on anything
just looks absolutely great I know this
guy is an interesting beast so let's go
through this one so this is a PT 16
we're also showing it for the first time
here at Computex it has a built in car
reader slot and if I pressed it on the
side here I can slit a ha stop of 2 and
1/2 inch I pay for a bit of Drive
expansion or external storage it's cool
because you know sometimes if it's a
huge file it's not really that viable to
move it over the network very quickly so
you can just pop a drive out and throw
it in this thing that's awesome that's
very very cool functionality now this
guy is interesting this guy isn't
actually in the Intel series of nut
computers this is AMD so yeah ok so amy
has been of course looking at the
development of NOx so we believe that it
is a like they say Nix they trying to
view images om-d decide to also join and
we're really happy to also help pop out
and popularize a good knock yeah it's
very cool
so AMD spreading out Intel spreading
into something crazy this is all crazy
hey guys we here our last stop of the
Soviet on booth I wanted to cover this
it's not ready yet it doesn't have a
name we can't test it out yet but it's
pretty crazy so I wanted to make sure
you guys could see it can we take off
the front here real quick I'm gonna take
off the front and reveal what's actually
going on here when you take off the top
and then the front comes out very very
nice-looking case so basically if you
haven't noticed yet there's no real
motherboard in there there's a there's a
there's a control panel but it's not a
motherboard so basically what you can do
with this is put a put a tiny little
power supply in there put a graphics
card in there and then connect through
thunderbolts who say a laptop if you
have a business grade laptop that's just
amazingly good looking sharp laptop it
doesn't have a graphics card and you
want to be a gamer and you don't
necessarily want to buy a huge PC you
can just thunder bolt this to your
laptop once it's ready and be able to
play games on that business class
notebook or laptop it's been Ultrabook
whatever you want as long as it has a
Thunderbolt cable you can add tons of
power to it
Desktop graphics will always crush
laptop graphics because you just have
all that surface area to put big big big
chips and whatever else you want this is
a very very cool product
