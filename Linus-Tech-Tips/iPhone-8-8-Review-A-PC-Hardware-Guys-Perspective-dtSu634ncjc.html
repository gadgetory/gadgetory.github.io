I was like oMG I need to go line up to
get one since I can do you ha ha no I'm
just kidding
debrand dealt with that for me thanks
bros and don't take this the wrong way
but it is undignified to stand around in
front of a store like a sucker waiting
for the privilege to buy a new gadget I
mean ok yeah but if it's like a super
cool gadget then it's totally different
the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus just
aren't that cool which is what I'm going
to talk about after I thank CyberPower
for sponsoring today's video check out
cyber powers desktops featuring Intel
seventh generation core i7 processors
over on Newegg at the link below
TLDR apples a talent was busy making the
iPhone 10 I mean it's not like the
engineers haven't been doing things over
the last couple of years
both the eight and the eight plus are
packing the all-new six core a 11
processor they have Apple's first-ever
in-house designed GPU credible
accomplishment by the way and they've
got more storage on the base models than
ever before
not to mention here is where my iPhone 6
is screen buckled yes I actually had it
happen while I was carrying it around
for mp3 player duties in my backpack and
that is totally not a thing anymore
Apple's design team on the other hand
has clearly had other priorities I mean
you are not gonna tell me that they
spent a year deciding to get rid of my
favorite color are you no you're not so
in a nutshell then the iPhone 8 and 8
plus are what Apple would normally call
a 7s no sexy new form factor just
updated guts and some features like a
revolutionary glass back for qi wireless
charging it men do they really think our
memories are that short anyway basically
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on the
hardware other than to say that most
people didn't really need a 7s the
battery did last longer for me than my
seven but aside from edge case workloads
like video encoding most people would be
very hard-pressed to notice a speed
difference between a seven and an eight
even comparing them side by side you can
only see the difference in loading times
for quite large apps and it's just not
feel above in day-to-day use the camera
system is better though selfies seem to
be a bit of a side grade rather than an
upgrade but as for the rear 12 megapixel
shooter it's got even more frames per
second in slow motion which is cool if
you're into that kind of stuff and in
low-light the viewfinder is much
smoother thanks probably to the faster
processor
on the subject of low light in this low
light shot you can see that it retained
more detail in the brushed finish of the
Logitech logo on my keyboard compared to
the seven and in this high contrast shot
with direct sunlight and very hard
shadows the improved resolution is very
obvious in the chain around the cat's
neck and from having been there in
person the coloration is more true to
life so they get kudos for that the
display also got an upgrade it's still
LCD with wide color gamut support not
OLED like the 10 but it's more better
than just got this true tone mode that's
supposed to adapt to ambient lighting
conditions to look more natural but from
my experience just made the screen look
dingy and yellow all the time and this
is kind of a curious one they added
support for HDR video content even
though Apple specifically says that it
is not an HDR display so it appears that
on Netflix anyway the new iPhone takes
the HDR 10 or Dolby vision encoded
stream then like backwards converts it
to this display why they would do that
is inexplicable to me but in terms of
results it ends up looking subjectively
better in some cases and worse in others
one thing that I'll say was different
for me this time around with the iPhone
is that I spent a lot more time with the
Plus model than I have in the past I
still don't like the form factor it's
just too big for me but the way that
some apps utilize the extra screen space
iPad style and the spectacular battery
life are fairly compelling selling
points even if I'm not too keen on the
dual lens camera fake bokeh really
doesn't do much for me and like the note
8 the telephoto camera is so much softer
that it doesn't look that much better to
me than a digital punch in on the
wide-angle lens so that's it the new
iPhone everyone it's a bit of a
non-story and appears to just be Apple's
strategy to keep overall unit sales from
dropping while OLED panel Supply is too
tight to produce all the iPhone 10s that
they need
so why is this video still going I'll
tell you why because iOS 11 is flippin
awesome and I want to talk about that
now I don't actually remember the last
time that I really noticed a software
update like this going into this video I
watched Apple's keynote but I'm gonna
ignore the headline stuff like augmented
reality 's TLDR it's neat but call me in
a year when the apps are a lot better
and I'm gonna ignore anything that I
found in a comprehensive list of all the
new features all the stuff I'm gonna
mention now I found naturally while
using the device completely intuitively
the way it's supposed to be control
center is now a single customizable page
with media controls and networking
controls built in and this super
intuitive forced Touch integration that
makes it just so deliciously functional
it even finally has a quick access
button for mobile hotspot whoo
so the only thing missing there is a
hard press on the Wi-Fi icon to see
nearby networks and connect to them and
maybe a VPN toggle I'm psyched on the
built-in screen record functionality my
local radio hosts were especially
fixated on this one apparently they were
excited that you could record snapchats
or something I don't know anything about
that but it'll definitely make doing
these reviews a lot easier the end
dictation button has been relocated a
couple of centimeters to the right
making it easier to stop it when you're
holding your phone in one hand path dick
feedback when starting and stopping
recording and the camera app is a
godsend though at this time I don't know
if this feature is actually getting
ported to older phones it's not doing it
on the iPhone 7 the new Quick Start
feature is amazing letting you set up
your new iPhone with the old one just by
moving them close to each other it
should be noted that probably for
security reasons it doesn't carry over
third-party credentials but weirdly
Twitter actually worked for a few
minutes before prompting me to re-enter
my password anyway it did save me a fair
bit of time and screenshot management is
so much better with cropping markup
sharing and
discarding of screenshots whose only use
was to show them to someone else all
handled on one screen there are some
things I'd still like to see changed
sure like volume adjustment for ringer
notifications and media playback still
isn't intuitively separated like it is
on Android
I don't consider enabling Apple pay to
be an integral part of setting up the
phone so go away
obnoxious red marker and finally how is
it even possible that we're still not
allowed to rearrange icons on the home
screen to our heart's content but
overall as someone who already liked iOS
and Android pretty well equally it went
far further than I expected to the point
where Oreo has its work cut out for it
so I really like this phone I am back on
iOS for now even if I still use wired
headphones like a caveman and I don't
prefer the extra baggage
speaking of extra baggage if you've got
your iPhone bumping around in your
baggage you don't want to get scratched
so why don't you cover it with a sexy D
brand skin they've got a ton of
different colors and textures and they
use only high-quality authentic 3m vinyl
not to mention their unrivaled precision
like everything fits flippin awesome
their customer service is spectacular
and if you don't know if your device is
gonna look good with the D brand skin
they have an amazing configurator on
their site that allows you to just swap
on different skins and set it up exactly
the way you like your device to be their
products are affordable and they ship
worldwide check them out at the link
below
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked do you know what to do but
