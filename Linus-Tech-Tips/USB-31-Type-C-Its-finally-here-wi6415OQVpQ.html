viewers the USB 3.1 and the type-c
connector aren't exactly going to be
anything new but what is new is having
actual hardware to play with and try it
out so here's the kid I got from MSI so
I guess the next step then is to bring
you guys along for the ride while I take
it for a test drive
of course our HX 1,200 I power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power and corsair link
digital for advanced monitoring and
control click this place right here to
learn more so much of the hype about the
USB 3.1 update is the all-new type-c
connector we've got an updated USB
connectors before micro B compared to
mini B was more difficult to orient by I
and theoretically rated for more
insertions but in my experience much
more fragile so it's only real benefit
was being smaller USB 3.0 type-a added
more pins deeper in on the connector and
came in a new sexy blue compared to the
black or white of previous USB standards
but never have we gotten anything as
paradigm-shifting as this the type-c
connector is smaller than anything but a
proprietary Lightning or mini or micro B
connector all of which can only handle
USB 2.0 yet it contains all the pins
necessary for 3.0 or 3.1 transfer speeds
a 5 gigabit or 10 gigabit per second
while being significantly more durable
than previous connectors that were
optimized for thin devices like phones
tablets and ultrabooks not to mention
it's reversible on top of all of that so
you'll never have to guess what goes
where and in what orientation while
fumbling around in the dark and Lord
knows that kind of thing would come in
handy for me if you know what I mean and
there's more cool stuff to USB 3.1 will
allow some of the pins to be used for
power with the USB power delivery v 2.0
specification up to a hundred watts
allowing not just smart phone or tablet
charging but even laptop charging and an
alternate mode that will let the type-c
connector be used on a per approval
basis to carry alternate signals such as
display port along with USB data so
that's cool you could plug your monitor
in with one cable for display power and
the built-in USB 3.1 hub but while these
are super sweet Texan 2
gather allowed Apple to build the 2015
MacBook with only a three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and a USB 3.1
type-c port for all its external storage
displays and charging
although whether or not Apple should
have built such a device as an entirely
separate matter this is where the waters
also get a little bit muddy when
discussing USB 3.1 and the type-c
connector USB 3.1 works with the old
connectors which has the benefit of
making it physically backwards
compatible with 3.0 2.0 or heck even 1.1
devices if you can find drivers for
anything that old but the drawback of
being basically just a speed bump then
from five gigabit to ten gigabit with
supported 3.1 devices that's right guys
without the type-c connector power is
limited and there's no support for
alternate modes to carry those other
fancy signals so then with that out of
the way let's see what's inside that
care package from MSI we've got an Intel
750 series PCIe SSD to ensure we've got
no bottlenecks on the other side of our
file transfer tests a custom controller
board that can be connected to two SSDs
in raid 0 to remove bottlenecks on that
side of the USB 3.1 connection to Intel
730 series SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
SSDs a cable with USB 3.1 type-c
connector on one side and the horrendous
and hopefully soon to be completely
forgotten to everyone but Samsung Note
users USB 3.0 micro B connector on the
other and finally a z97 a gaming 6
motherboard complete with USB 3.1 and a
type-c connector for all that
functionality which leads us to
benchmarks I am completely out of space
in the office right now so I actually
ended up being set up in the hallway
where I've also been working on
performance numbers for the network file
servers that we're deploying at the new
office stay tuned because those videos
will be coming soon I hope and got to
work I'll be honest with you guys
between the driver that Windows 8.1 pick
up on its own the one and MSI's page for
the board and the slightly
one I found on pluggable comm
performance actually wasn't as good for
me as I found people reporting elsewhere
on the web now to be clear I'm not
accusing other publications of posting
bogus numbers and I don't think that
they are I think it's more of a
reflection of the early state of this
hardware and the software drivers that
go with it that from one revision to
another
I can see improvements in random read
and write performance at the cost of
sequential reads and writes or the other
way around it just seems like they're in
the process of doing a lot of
fine-tuning right now so even if we were
getting the same numbers as everyone
else the point is it's not the
improvement we saw going from 2.0 to 3.0
but that was never what it was made out
to be it's just a minor rev I mean if it
was going to be 10 times faster again
I'm sure they'd have called it USB 4.0
what USB 3.1 is though is a wonderful
technology for the future it's an
obvious replacement for the previous
mini and micro connectors whether you've
got the power and the additional data on
the other side or not and in the longer
term I think it's also an outstanding
competitor for Thunderbolt a faster and
in many ways more advanced technology
that I've always found interesting in a
geeky sense I mean who doesn't want you
know six twenty gigabit connections on
their PC but one that appears will never
overcome the limits imposed on it by its
cost that puts it up against ten gig
Ethernet in any kind of professional
setting with more than a couple of users
and its inability to handle more than
point-to-point connections which makes
it uncompetitive with the aforementioned
ten gigabit ethernet in my mind so right
now it looks like it's poised for huge
success the decoupling of the 3.1 speed
standard from the type-c connector will
undoubtedly lead to some confusion and
unnecessary trips back to Best Buy once
folks realize they brought they bought
the wrong USB 3.1 cable but it's a small
price to pay since this way phones or
any devices that won't have any need for
10 gigabit transfer speeds for now won't
be made more expensive not to mention
hotter and more power hungry by
additional chipsets to handle USB 3.1
speeds for no apparent reason
but they can
benefit from the better connector until
such time as they're ready for
turbocharged data transfer speed
something I suspect will actually just
never happen since it's not like the
wireless standards bodies are sitting
with their thumbs up their collective
butts either speaking of having a thumb
up your butt Nick I guess since we don't
have a sponsor spot for today way to go
Nick now my children will starve just
kidding you work hard bro so thanks guys
