Intel today both of which I would
classify as enthusiasts delight at the
forefront is the core i7 4790k coding
Devil's Canyon their new 4 gigahertz
base 4.4 gigahertz boost quad-core
hyper-threaded unlocked an overclockable
mainstream flagship and then quietly in
the background is the pentium g 32:58
the modest 3.2 gigahertz clock speed and
two processing cores with no hyper
threading and no turbo boost so with
that all in mind the star of the show
today might surprise you a bit for the
ultimate no compromises compact gaming
PC look no further than the obsidian
series 250 d from Corsair click now to
learn more let's start with an
explanation of intel's Devil's Canyon
codename and what that actually means
the silicon is actually not physically
different than previous Haswell CPUs so
put aside your expectations of tangible
performance gains at the same clock
speeds this is an evolutionary step not
a revolutionary one so what does that
even mean well on the surface not too
much the core i7 4790k features a 100
megahertz clock speed improvement over
the 4770k with the same features enabled
at the same price so it's sure better
than a kick in the pants but if that's
all that we were getting the whole
Devil's Canyon branding might have
seemed a little bit out of place
the two main real improvements are
actually more behind the scenes and some
of the most enthusiast friendly things
Intel's done in quite some time it looks
like they're really listening to us
first up they have fixed the thermal
interface material between the core and
the metal heat spreader on the top of
the CPU that was causing Haswell chips
to run extremely hot especially when
over volting and overclocking for more
performance number two is that due to
small incremental improvements in the
manufacturing process yields on these
dyes have allowed Intel to provide much
more consistently highly overclockable
4790k s compared to the previous
generation has well chips so more
consistency in the overclocking
again a big thumbs up put together these
two things aren't going to be enough to
make every current Haswell owner toss
their chip and rush to the store for an
upgrade but they will mean a more
consistent overclocking experience and a
cooler running cpu for anyone who does
take the plunge I'll be handing off to
Luke to give you guys some idea of what
we could squeeze out of our sample and
how it compares to running its dock
speed but first I'd like to introduce
the real star of the show today IMHO the
pentium g 32:58
might not have sounded exceptional when
i introduced it but i left off one very
important thing it's unlocked
that means that for the first time in
years intel is giving gamers and
enthusiasts the gift of an overclockable
chip that's priced so low but you can
get it and an overclocking ready z87 or
z97 motherboard for less than the price
of their previously entry-level unlocked
CPU at the core i5 tier so just as a
recap it's got only two cores less cash
no hyper threading and no support for
turbo Aang up to faster speeds under
ideal conditions on its own but who
cares we've got this bad boy 2 4.7
gigahertz on our test bench so stay
tuned for some gaming benchmark suckas
oh and spoiler alert it's going to be
surprisingly close to the quad-core all
the bells and whistles models in gaming
over to you leap you start with a quick
disclaimer for both of these processors
Linus gave me exactly zero minutes to
fine-tune the voltage I was able to get
the fastest clock speed I could get on
these chips but I was not able to lower
the voltage to an acceptable level so
the voltage is going to be a little bit
high and you could definitely get away
with a little bit lower voltage on both
these chips for both of these speeds but
this is as fast as I was able to get
either of them the 4790k was pretty nice
to overclock and deals with temperatures
quite well even at one point three volts
running at full load under i-264
it only got to about 7075 degrees the
Pentium K though was super freaking
surprising I was told this was supposed
to be a great processor but getting on
the bench and messing it with with it
yourself is kind of fantastic under full
load I 264 1.35 volts this thing that
hits about 60 65 degrees that's crazy
you can get that lower obviously by
getting a better
voltage thresholds but it you almost
don't even need to the potential of this
processor is fantastic so let's check
out that performance in terms of gaming
performance the 4790k data boat as
expected it's a little bit faster and
everything but not a ton faster don't
worry about the stars is and result I
think that's probably more based on star
sees and not being very well optimized
yet as its pre-alpha and less to do with
the processor the pentium cave oh holy
crap if you're getting this processor
please overclock it you get so much
benefit from overclocking this thing
it's awesome it's very noticeable in
certain games and one thing to note is
one of the biggest improvements that inc
that is increasing this average result
which we're reporting is an increase in
minimum frame rates which is going to be
the most noticeable so this is great to
overclock this processor especially with
your only overclocking 2 cores and
they're the two most important course so
please overclock this processing before
we jump into Cinebench performance i
want to give a shout out to the
Cinebench thread in the cpu section of
the line of tech tips forum started by
jumper one one eight that threads kind
of awesome and we will be showing
performance probably directly based to
the results in that threads you guys
compare the results on that thread to
these processors directly the pentium k
didn't do that great but that's kind of
expected this thing isn't designed for
heavily threaded workloads and Cinebench
is so i wouldn't worry about that too
much
the 4790k did very well on the other
hand to reiterate on our voltage we're
currently running in h 100 and you don't
need to spend a hundred dollars on your
CPU cooler tom's hardware has a report
of 4.6 gigahertz on on air with much
less voltage than we're currently
running and i might have been able to
get my voltage down but who knows I just
wouldn't worry about spending more than
your processor on a cooler you can get
very good results with the CPU with not
a ton of heat if you want more guidance
on how to overclock these CPUs and
hopefully how to tune that voltage in a
little bit more Linus will have a full
overclocking guide coming in the near
future from Linus and speaking of Linus
back to you hey I'm back so one more tip
guys is that as appealing as those
numbers looked and as appealing has the
price for this chip will look if you
check the link to the product in the
video description
remember when you're shopping to factor
in platform cost overclocking
and League competing boards from the
Green Team are cheaper than zseries
boards so watch out for that but then
again there are rumors about some
h-series boards being hack sword to
overclock the G 32:58 which would bring
pricing much closer so keep your ear to
the ground in the coming months and make
sure you're paying attention when it's
actually time to pull the trigger now
speaking of your ears to the ground or
something our latest new sponsor is ting
in their whole spiel is actually pretty
straightforward there are wireless
carrier in the US that says straight up
we're running on the Sprint network so
you won't be using some janky small one
they build / use rather than requiring
you to play like guessing games about
how many texts you're going to send in a
given month and then picked out a
prepackaged plan and when you call their
customer service you talk to a real
person not an automated menu
finally they claim that 98% of people
will save money by switching to ting but
you don't have to take their word for it
check out the link in the video
description to try out their savings
calculator the way it works is you enter
the numbers from your last three bills
on your current carrier and it shows you
how much you would have paid if you're
on ping-mei on top of that if you go to
line of starting com which is that link
in the video description you can get 25
bucks off a new device or 25 dollars in
service credit cool anyway guys like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment tell me
what do you think who was the star of
the show
Devil's Canyon or the pentium g 32:58 I
think you guys all know which one luke
and i are most excited about but hey
there you go everybody loves the bargain
rates don't forget to subscribe if you
haven't already and that's it peace out
I got to go do when show in like 19
minutes and you guys wonder why that
show is late sometimes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
