motherboard this is the p67 a c43 so
it's very similar to the c-45 except for
a couple small things and that couple
small things is pretty much one small
thing it doesn't have as many USB 2.0
ports so we're gonna go through the
overall feature this board this is an
1155 board which means you've got
support for Intel Core i3 Core i5 and
core i7 processors on the of the
second-generation variety so only 1155
chips don't try to use an 1156 chip in
here it will not work so we're talking
2500 K will work 2600 K will work 8 7 5
K will not work ok features the military
class 2 concept with super ferrite
chokes solid caps it's got OC Genie 2
for a OneTouch overclocking of K series
processors as well as a UEFI click BIOS
let's flip this over it features a three
year warranty in the USA in Canada and
ok there's nothing under there Kat let's
see what else they have to say for
themselves we've got wink III which is
their software that allows you to chat
with friends maintain hard drive data
added Docs and photos without any OS and
you can also surf the internet and
that's pretty much it for the back of
the box yeah that's pretty much it so
let's open this guy up and have a look
see this is interesting huh fascinating
cable
ok well we'll talk about that in minute
first we've got our drivers and
utilities DVD throw it away
download the latest op the msi website
here is a quick installation guide you
may need that if you want to install it
quickly software application user guide
actual motherboard user guide blue color
inside inside cover that whoa is that it
what board is that well that is an extra
of g8 board ok that's not a popular x58
board anymore this there eclipse very
old very discontinued it's okay
alright we've got a couple SATA cables
one right angle one straight we've got
some N connect
these are for easily connecting your
front panel connectors we've got an i/o
shield which is yeah look at that
color-coded very nice very very very
nice alright and we've got what appears
to be a USB three header two USB two
male headers so you can I can get it
focused they'll be able to see the pins
on this thing so if you want to turn
your internal USB 3.0 header into an
internal USB 2.0 header you could do
that if you wanted okay
so let's grab the board itself just
gonna close the box real quick here you
can cooperate mr. baggy and here is the
board itself so it looks very similar to
its well very similar brother the people
you hold I'm just a Down moment oh okay
I get it hold on I'll be back in a
minute okay here is the difference so
you see that NEC chip there there's some
other board components around it better
seating here this guy right here okay
well I'm gonna turn my manual focus off
actually no that's fine not present here
so this is a USB 2 header see how it's
color-coded black and see how it's
color-coded blue on the other board and
it's called well here it's called USB
three inside see USB 3.0 here it is not
called any such thing because and now
I'm gonna turn my manual focus off the
c43 only features one focus manual focus
is off uh-oh I'll be back in a minute
Kate manual focus is off now okay so
because this board only features two
years
be 3.0 ports that's why I got confused
as soon as I saw the USB 3.0 ports on
the back and I saw a header here I was
like well how does this work it only has
two ports because this is a USB 2.0
header but rather than redesigning the
PCB they just haven't included the USB 3
chipset here the NEC chips that we saw
on the higher-end board and that is why
it has this funky adapter because now
this is a USB 2.0 header so there's
another USB 2.0 header for a total of
two okay so the overall layout of the
this board is very similar we've got our
LGA 1155 socket right here in the middle
you've got lots of room around it you
can see this lower end board also
doesn't include the heat sinks around
the CPU area that are cooling so you can
see the outlines for where they would
normally belong that are cooling the
voltage regulation modules we have an 8
pin power connector up here in the top
left as well as support for four sticks
of ddr3 running in dual Channel our
24-pin power is along the right hand
edge of the board in its optimal
location and moving down we have full
support for say two three six gigabit
per second running off of the Intel
chipset come on focus there you go as
well as four SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports here is the heatsink for the Intel
chipset itself and continuing to move
down the board we have all of our front
panel connectors our USB 2.0 header that
I have now talked about endlessly and
we've also got front no front firewire
which the other board did have we have
no rear firewire either for that matter
but we'll get to that in a moment and we
also have our front panel audio
connector now in terms of the slot
layout it is the same as its Big Brother
so we have three PCIe 1x one PCIe 16x
and three PCI slots so if you were to
install a dual slot graphics card in the
PCIe 16x slot then you would still have
access to two PCIe 1x and three PCI
slots so on a lower-end board that's
what I would consider optimal because
most people are going to be carrying
over their PCI adding cards when they're
not buying like a super expensive
motherboard alright here we go so we've
got a ps2 u.s. ps2 yes it is ps2 but
it's not us
anything it's a ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port we've got eight USB 2.0 ports it
still got the clear CMOS button very
nice very handy for this looks like a
good budget overclocking bored with that
clear CMOS on the back we've got a
coaxial audio out optical audio out
Gigabit Ethernet USB 3.0 and 7.1 audio
nothing really interesting to speak up
on the back thank you for checking out
