we want to do is lift with a back twist
to jerk in a you know jerking motion but
biggest thing of all what you want to

kind of hilarious where have you been
Shane hero of what homes that's a great
place for a phone Brandon yeah like it
belongs there
the paint
this is exciting so can we move to all
the stuff over here
that's just magical so it's day whatever
we are finally getting the LTTE set oh
and we have a railing now I think I
mentioned that before though so we're
gonna move all of these shelves to over
here because they need to build sets
they need to build a b-roll set there
and then like something else goes here
then it's do something funny this is no
longer a number because we distributed
everything else where he did
look height standing desk and we're now
making it a line at height fitting death
it's the tiniest threading ever so you
literally have to spin for like a minute
to get it to go down an inch
alright it is what up today meetup - we
did get sort of more people than I was
necessarily hoping for you guys are all
awesome thank you for being here so so
these people showed up for the tour and
the garage sale has a lot bigger of a
line this is the shortest line with
shortest line with the smartest line
don't need a picture with you or now
absolutely Lyons I'm gonna film this
torque this ah lady was literally
painted this morning this is our named
green screen I don't know where YouTube
expects people to put these things down
on the wall that's just a show we got we
got a joker on the tour this - so this
is the server room so this is where
legitimately pretty much all of the
magic happens this is the editing end so
we actually had to move into this place
before our final inspection was done and
before all the construction was done so
everything is very temporary right so
this is where our sales team sits a lot
of people don't understand like how
time-consuming and how expensive it is
all I'll come out there for this
this is views per day okay this is your
classic hockey stick actually this this
so what happened was I hired Nick light
that day some call me an egg it allowed
me to spend my time making better videos
oh wow the tourists are oh my goodness
okay Wow I'm boxing now do have a busing
now mystery box
it's from Intel I legitimately do you
want know what is inside tonight
yes it is a core i7 6700 table alright
good this way right
Oh
oh no we missed out the point of your
confidence socks and sandals
one man's trailer just so I guess that's
pretty much it for today all that's left
