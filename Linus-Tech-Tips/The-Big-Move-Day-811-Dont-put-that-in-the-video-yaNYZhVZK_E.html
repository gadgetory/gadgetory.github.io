the mastercase 5 by Cooler Master lets
you make your mid tower PC case your own
with an assortment of modular
accessories check out the link in the
video description to learn more look at
all those productive people this way

Burkle's gonna kill this spider ready to
go you are such a pansy look at this guy
220 pounds and he's terrified of a tiny
little spider you want such a wimp it's
all male alright so this is the
benchmarking room here we've got John

to be just a beautiful set right there
that's going to be the view once we got
this whole wall in and Alliance media
group logo is gonna go right there and
these are all going to be painted gonna
be awesome so here we're going to be
tearing apart the old trailer that line
is gone Oh
actually I'll hang a part okay this is a
safety road hazard yeah yeah
like that's a pretty thick coat of rust
well the rust protects it from more rust
right yes that's how that works
we have dentists he's still alive all
right no more subtitles
no more subsets they don't need
subtitles I'm gonna subtitle that with
something this is my phone case oh okay
Dennis what did you do Dennis
you just water Dennis bag why ability so
today because the Internet's down there
helping me move all of this stuff onto
the stained floor so that it's this is a
sealed floor so this unfortunately is
not so now we have to move everything
over again which sucks so I made this
car yesterday I'm useful Purple's not no
grand below the joint Wow thanks for
tuning in I think along ok here I mean
good lovin oh you don't never wear a
glove we're just so I am sort of
anything incorporated oh he's going for

whoa look at the no and that's powerful
boxes I can't even believe it dude that
was just like the tightest thing I've
seen all frickin way Oh
what does Nick's shirt say yeah this is
a little racist and you got me a shirt
that says white people can't read this
I'm being racist people Luis
guess what white people can't read this
I can read it okay you're you're white
can you read that why none of this can
go on the channel
I just can't avoid it all are so
inappropriate look at that guy's you're
such a stinker
Nikki be back here with a little bit of
bodybuilding tips if you don't get your
portal you know afford a gym membership
something just buy yourself some you
know $2,000 lights it's gonna set you
back on the full grand and then you can
do a shoulder dip exercise you know this
rugs yeah yeah shrug it out you know
it's kind of like the opposite of a dip
and then somebody asks you your
questions you'd be like so what you'd be
really good at that
Sen that's all we need today whenever
someone was very good they've got get
another floor what happened
sit down there Ben got a dug into the
floor when someone guy move it this one
we're gonna houses disassembled just
look at that eighth Justin did it come
here would you look at that oh my god

go up to it and say would you look at
what would you look at that still none
of this can go on the channel that's
from a video that's up buddy he's look
at that guy have you never seen those
that's your nail home
Dennis our office yeah get in there I
need to call from the closet
congratulations you came out of the
Wardrobe
don't be so insensitive all right Nicky
be here back with another movie tip okay
so we got this big-ass thing here what
we want to do is lift with a back twist
to jerk in a you know jerking motion but
biggest thing of all what you want to
remember is to wear open-toed shoes okay
so if this thing falls off you're not
getting a half cutting your foot nobody
wants that you're cutting that toe clean
off go to your mama's house you can swap
back on for your no problem that's all
today folks

shut up Karen
I'll see you grabbing any would know
they were having well sir sighs in the
sense I mean oh oh you're being upstaged
by Justin I am missing about a pint of
blood yeah like that yeah once you get
tested for hold eight
well it says I'm positive so it counts
right
don't leave that in this work this looks
kind of hilarious where have you been
Shane hero of what homes that's a great
place for a phone Brandon yeah like it
belongs there
the paint
this is exciting so can we move to all
the stuff over here
that's just magical so it's day whatever
we are finally getting the LTTE set oh
and we have a railing now I think I
mentioned that before though so we're
gonna move all of these shelves to over
here because they need to build sets
they need to build a b-roll set there
and then like something else goes here
then it's do something funny this is no
longer a number because we distributed
everything else where he did
look height standing desk and we're now
making it a line at height fitting death
it's the tiniest threading ever so you
literally have to spin for like a minute
to get it to go down an inch
alright it is what up today meetup - we
did get sort of more people than I was
necessarily hoping for you guys are all
awesome thank you for being here so so
these people showed up for the tour and
the garage sale has a lot bigger of a
line this is the shortest line with
shortest line with the smartest line
don't need a picture with you or now
absolutely Lyons I'm gonna film this
torque this ah lady was literally
painted this morning this is our named
green screen I don't know where YouTube
expects people to put these things down
on the wall that's just a show we got we
got a joker on the tour this - so this
is the server room so this is where
legitimately pretty much all of the
magic happens this is the editing end so
we actually had to move into this place
before our final inspection was done and
before all the construction was done so
everything is very temporary right so
this is where our sales team sits a lot
of people don't understand like how
time-consuming and how expensive it is
all I'll come out there for this
this is views per day okay this is your
classic hockey stick actually this this
so what happened was I hired Nick light
that day some call me an egg it allowed
me to spend my time making better videos
oh wow the tourists are oh my goodness
okay Wow I'm boxing now do have a busing
now mystery box
it's from Intel I legitimately do you
want know what is inside tonight
yes it is a core i7 6700 table alright
good this way right
Oh
oh no we missed out the point of your
confidence socks and sandals
one man's trailer just so I guess that's
pretty much it for today all that's left
now is to clean up the wreckage ah which
