20x all-in-one liquid cooler from Swift
tech is the value I mean okay yes it's
one of the most expensive all-in-one
water coolers on the market but the
stuff that you get for your money is
phenomenal the jazz mini phone and
tablet stand from Coolermaster is now
available in a variety of cool colors
from these great retailers click now to
learn more so let's kick things off with
a physical tour and while we're going
through this I'm going to have a running
total of what it would cost us to build
something comparable as like a DIY
liquid cooling kit that you piece
together with aftermarket parts so the
included CPU block is the Apogee XL
which features flagship class
performance swappable color plates to
match your system and Swift Tech's
fantastic high-quality mounting hardware
connecting it to the rest of the unit is
a pair of metal swivel fittings and some
black kink resistant 3/8 inch tubing
that's secured to the fittings with some
really nice metal hose clamps onto the
rest of the unit we find a significant
departure from the traditional ko
approach instead of putting the pump on
top of the block Swift tech has
integrated their new MCP 30 pump and a
basic windowed acrylic reservoir
directly onto the copper and brass dual
120 millimeter radiator that will mount
in the top of your case on the radiator
we discovered two of Swift Tech's helix
pwm fans that are pre-installed a nice
touch in a push orientation that will
require no adjustment if you want to
draw air into the top of your chassis
but can be reversed in a couple of
minutes if you prefer to use internal
case air to cool your water loop and
exhaust it in terms of accessories Swift
tech concludes thermal compound all the
mounting hardware that you need for LGA
1155 1150 1156 all that good stuff extra
hardware for until LGA 2011 and AMD
sockets and finally this is a really
great inclusion and a port pwm fan
splitter that uses SATA 4 power and the
CPU header on the motherboard to control
speed so their whole system the pump is
also PWM compliant by the way can have
performance and
levels adjusted dynamically according to
CPU temps depending on how you set up
the fan profile on your motherboard very
very cool and very intuitive alright so
some of these things we're probably a
little bit overkill and actually aren't
needed with competing all-in-one liquid
cooler designs because of how tightly
integrated they are but the point here
is not the base functionality but rather
the fact that you're getting
expandability and truly enthusiast class
water cooling gear in an ail I mean most
all-in-one water coolers are sealed
because they need to be sealed the pumps
wouldn't work with more components in
the loop or a larger radiator or the
tubing is permanently attached to
plastic barbs to save the cost of the
fittings and clamps not the case here
you can install it out of the box more
easily than most air coolers let alone
other all-in-ones
since the LGA 1150 hold down in
backplate as well as the radiator fans
are all pre-installed just screw the
fans into the top of your case with the
fan screws apply thermal compound and
screw the block onto the backplate or
you can tear it apart and go to town
adding more blocks radiators and
what-have-you because the components
particularly the pump have performance
to spare but of course all of this is a
complete moot point if it doesn't
perform the way Swift tech promises so
we're going to throw it in our test
system and let you guys know how it does
out of the box first off I want to talk
about their awesome little included fan
controller it has to be plugged into the
CPU header and it will only read the RPM
of the first fan plugged in that's the
fan that's plugged into the the Redcaps
lot on the pwm fan controller it will
read the RPM of that fan and then
distribute power to each different
header depending on how that fan is
being read so if you want it giving that
fan a hundred percent power all the fans
on the controller will get 100% power in
terms of acoustics it's actually better
than I thought I was pretty worried
about the pump being mounted on the
radiator as I thought you would hear a
lot of vibration from that but
especially with the Noctua fans
installed with their little sound
dampening brown rubber grommets on them
there wasn't really that big of a deal
and even with the Swift tech fans
installed as long as you install it
tightly you won't really notice the pump
is much better than I
if it was on the original h2 20 and it
doesn't make as much of an impact in
terms of noise in terms of aesthetic I
think it looks nice but dude a--they
looks nice and extra features you may
have problems mounting it in certain
situations I wouldn't worry too much
about stuff like motherboard
compatibility because the hang off on
the radiator is going to be far away
from your on the board but I would worry
about mounting it pretty much anywhere
other than the very top of your case it
probably won't be that big of a deal for
you because you're probably going to
mount it in the top of your case anyways
so this probably doesn't matter but if
you're going to do something like Linus
did in the 4k ultimate build guide and
mount it in say the front it could be a
problem as you're probably not going to
be able to mount it there in most cases
the tubing will also come to play with
compatibility again this isn't nearly as
long as the tubing on the original 220
but I kind of like that the original 220
had some pretty ridiculous tubing
lengths and this again probably will
cause issues if you try to mount it
anywhere other than the top of the case
but as I see most of you are probably
going to be installing it in the top of
the case it's probably not a huge deal
and I do really like the thickness and
flexibility of the tubing at the same
time in terms of performance running our
standard test bench a48 20k with 1.3
volts applied running at 4.0 gigahertz
and a 68 70 reference card which will
both be running prime95 and combustor
respectively also I swapped out the
standard fans for Noctua nff 12s as we
normally do and it performed great I was
a little bit worried due to the pump and
the the like flow meter and stuff
conflicting with airflow on the radiator
but it didn't seem to affect it that
much as the only cooler that beat it was
a 2 by 140 millimeter cooler which
should have if this beatitude by 140
millimeter cooler I probably would have
redone by testing a few more times so
happy to see it did really well and
happy to see it is the successor of the
original 220 it's good to see all these
high-performance parts in one big
package alright guys thanks for watching
let me know what you think about hey can
you do me a favor
I'm not a Razors can you run to the
storm grab you some no not in my job
description
ok um well this is a little awkward when
I get back can you help me shave the
spots I can't reach yeah
not in my job description at all oh okay
well then I guess you're fired
I'll finish up the conclusion here -
yeah that book but I quit so it's good
thanks he quit I fired it and that my
friends is why you should always use
