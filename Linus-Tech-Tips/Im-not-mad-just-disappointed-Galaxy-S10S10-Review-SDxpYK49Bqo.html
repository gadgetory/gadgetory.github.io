your standard phone review has become
these days here's a post from user VAR
core over on XDA developers from two
weeks before Samsung unveiled their
latest and greatest s series smartphones
the Galaxy S ten es10 and S 10 plus the
pros over the s9 are much faster
processing speeds bigger battery and
display in display fingerprint reader 5g
in the second release a bevy of
specialized cameras larger internal and
external storage and on the high-end
model twelve gigabytes of RAM it would
seem to have no real competition but
there are two glaring cons as well the
camera cutouts marring the display and
its price yeah okay sounds about right
so I should probably just hire that guy
or gal and save myself some time but I
didn't instead I spent the last few
weeks trying really hard to love the s10
plus and its little brother over here so
here are my thoughts brought to you by a
soos the ROG rapture gtx 11000 is a 10
gigabit Wi-Fi router featuring
two-and-a-half gig gaming ports a
quad-core processor a imesh support and
Wi-Fi 6 technology that is supported by
the samsung galaxy s 10 check it out at
the link below
it is no big secret that I am NOT a fan
of odd shaped displays I mean
ignoring the admittedly quite hilarious
purpose made wallpapers there is quite
literally zero content that is designed
to have a bite taken out of it why well
I'll tell you why because it's a silly
backward step in our otherwise fairly
consistent journey towards displays that
occupy our field of vision as naturally
and fully as possible and it's obviously
one that isn't going to last so why be
like the TV shows that failed to embrace
widescreen and have all your content
look stupid in a year or two or like
today for that matter and yeah I think
that's actually the worst part of all of
this Samsung stayed away for this long
only to finally belly flop face-first
into this unfortunate industry trend
right when their Chinese competitors
like Oppo vivo and Nubia have already
declared it dead all three of those have
already shipping phones with no knotch
and nearly full coverage displays thanks
to innovations like motorized and
sliding selfie cams or in what is IMO
the most futuristic and cool move the
elimination of the selfie cam altogether
in favor of using the rear camera for
everything something that probably would
have been a good move for Samsung this
time around I was pretty pleased overall
with the rear camera the app needs to go
back to allowing both still and video
capture from the same screen but for
video the only glaring issue that needs
to be resolved is the frame skipping
when you capture a still during video
recording and as for stills regardless
of DXL mark scores and what-have-you
I would still take an iPhone 10s or a
pixel three over the galaxy s 10 but it
is a clear step up from my note 9 when
it comes to delivering sharp photos of
my wonderful but always moving children
and managed adequate low-light
performance for my purposes no the issue
with the camera is
the front-facing camera or cameras are
you seriously telling me that this was
the best you could do both the
wide-angle and regular lens deliver at
best no improvement over the note nine
and at worst some of the most
inexplicably poor results that I've seen
in a few generations what the heck is
this there's just no excuse now honors
latest phone that has a pinhole display
this on the s10 plus this is an exit
wound and you went and put that in my
screen for these results these photos
you're looking at here were taken under
identical conditions on full auto okay
so I got that out of my system in all
seriousness though I did mostly stop
noticing the pinhole after a while so
how about we talk about day to day use
because there's actually a lot to love
here starting with battery life a seven
nanometer processor with 4100 milliamp
hours in this form factor yes please
wicked fast wireless and wired charging
yeah I'll take some of that too now some
Exynos users have been complaining of
higher than normal idle battery drain
but it's yet to be determined if that's
a widespread issue or just Samsung
phones doing Samsung things and many
other users particularly of the
Snapdragon variety are reporting screen
on time in the range of 6 to even 8
hours or more and that honestly is more
in line with my experience this thing
has been great so far on the subject of
the screen we're ignoring the shrapnel
wound it's actually been a while since
I've been this wowed by a phone display
I mean it's so vibrant and it manages to
feel just like extra responsive in spite
of the fact that it still runs at a mere
60 Hertz also Samsung has really managed
to tone down the distortion and the
dimness of the curved glass along the
edges even compared to the note 9 from
less than a year ago if only they had
watched my review of that phone because
they actually managed to undo some of
the progress that they made last summer
when they widened the side bezels so
like the note 9 the S 10 plus is
gigantic device that makes one-handed
operation a little bit challenging and
Samsung obviously knows this because
they've made some helpful optimizations
to their Android skin to minimize how
often it is that you'll actually need to
reach all the way up to the top this
there's your brightness slider it's not
bad right it's just that as cool as one
handed mode is I don't buy a big phone
to use it at 50% size and by slimming
down the side bezels again they've
dramatically increased the frequency
with which I accidentally trigger apps
or keyboard presses or the back button
while I'm reaching across the display
it's a non-issue in my opinion on the
s10 but it bothered me on the plus and I
hope they don't do the same thing on the
note 10 another thing that I'm hoping
surely in vain not to encounter on the
note 10 is the ultrasonic fingerprint
sensor now I got the software update
that did improve the sub 20% success
rate that I was having with this thing
see I got it there but it's still not a
hundred percent and this is especially
true it seems when my hands are really
dry making matters worse even when it's
working properly it's just straight up
not as fast as the optical sensor that's
employed by one plus in the 60 like not
even close now it's better than picking
up my phone and touching the back of it
but it does hurt
the otherwise great overall
responsiveness of this device like it
really does feel great in the hand too I
can't actually speak for the ceramic
version both Samsung and D brand
actually sent over the glass backed ones
but it's thin and well balanced with
pretty much all the things I've come to
expect from a Samsung flagship device
except better the speaker standout is
achieving much better stereo separation
on supported content like this is a
really loud amplified earpiece speaker
in spite of its diminutive size and on
the bottom Oh a headphone jack that's a
welcome sight
oh so turns out you can get ip68
resistance with it it's just more work
how about that the one step backward
here is the ergonomics of the lock
button again this isn't a big issue on
the smaller s10 but on the plus
seems like what they've done is moved it
up uncomfortably far on the phone in
order to fix a problem that doesn't
exist anymore now that they're finally
allowing users to remap the bixby button
so you're not constantly mashing bixby
when you try to lock your phone on that
note I don't actually hate nixb I just
don't want her showing up uninvited so I
just changed it to a double-click that's
also a nice new little option they've
gotten there and I haven't had any
frustrating issues since then so how did
this take you numpties two years to fix
when you had all the user feedback it's
such an obvious solution yay on that
subject here's a few more things for you
to ignore for the next 24 months then
spend an hour fixing when someone in
senior management finally watches a
review or to bring back the extra
granularity and volume control with the
slider please I listen to reruns or
music while I sleep and I can't get it
quiet enough anymore also what is this
locate an app nonsense when I search in
the app drawer just let me drag it to
the home screen please and finally
Samsung do away with this stupid carrier
lock crap when you first install a sim
if I bought an unlocked phone that's
because that's what I wanted I know the
carrier's want you to do this but grow a
pair anyway I really don't want the
thing Samsung has done wrong to distract
from what they've done right here I
still hate the island not ugly
distracting and most importantly
completely unnecessary but the bottom
line is that the s10 and s10 plus are
lightning fast with what is in my
opinion the best Samsung software
experience yet and a great feel in the
hand they have problems but I do tend to
find them easier to forgive when I can
sit down and write this entire review
while listening to music on my thigh OFA
7 is yeah they may have it key caveman
wires attached to them but you know what
they blow the doors off your air pods
and you can have them from me when you
pry them from my cold dead fingers
speaking of cold dead fingers dbrand
is gonna kill me when they see this
Segway deep
and skins are a great way to not just
have your device look better but also to
take care of it because they can help
protect from incidental scuffs and
scratches one of the coolest things
about D brand is when you go on their
website and select your device you can
preview in real time exactly what its
gonna look like so you don't just have
to go okay i want yellow here or i want
you know carbon-fiber there are this
absolutely sick man I love this
honeycomb finish that they sent over on
the s10 and s 2 n plus you can mix and
match things if you're into that kind of
thing and create exactly the look you
want they offer cheap international
shipping and you can check them out at
