thing is really really cool that's it
that's the whole video I'm gonna just
leave
skee okay so the wide back what's cool
about the Y Drive allows you to share
your media content with up to three
devices simultaneously using this as a
portable wireless access point now
what's cool about the Y Drive compared
to other competing solutions is that the
Y drive allows you to connect to its
Wi-Fi access point and still browse the
internet on your mobile device I know
right so it allows upstream and
downstream connections to Wi-Fi access
points so basically what I'm doing is I
have my router in my house I have the Y
Drive sitting on the table next to me
and then I have my iPhone somewhere in
the same room so I'm connecting my
iPhone to the Y Drive I'm connecting the
Y Drive to the router and through that
I'm able to access the media that I'm
sharing on the y drive and I'm also able
to access the internet now it will feel
a little bit slower because it is being
relayed but for the sake of being able
to access your media content and the
Internet at the same time I think it is
worth the additional delay so Y Drive is
available on the App Store there is an
app for the iPad iPhone and iPod touch
okay there's also no other information
on here at all let's have a look at
what's included with the Y Drive so
we've got a wall adapter comes out like
that and you have a very satisfying
click sound to it anyway there's also a
USB charger so the Y Drive as I
mentioned before supports up to three
consecutive users and I have a bunch of
notes about things like battery life but
I forgot to print them out and I forgot
to load them up on my phone so you guys
are gonna have to bear with me for a
second we're gonna turn the camera off
and I'm going to look up my cheat sheet
so here's the Y Drive unit itself it is
backed by a one-year warranty from
Kingston with 24/7 tech support so
that's something to bear in mind it all
is also a pocket-sized device so
actually hear about and I compared it to
the
so it's basically like carrying around
another iPhone and all you're doing is
you are increasing the storage capacity
whether it's by 16 gigs or by 32 gigs so
my box says 32 gigs but this unit itself
is actually a 16 gig unit just because
it's an email so it was not really a
Miss in there correct in the correct box
now you can see up here at the top of
the y drive that's where the USB port is
so you can either use that for charging
the device and the battery lasts for up
to 4 hours or you can use it to transfer
data to the Y Drive from your home
computer whether it's a PC or a
Macintosh so over here we've also got a
power button what appears to be a little
reset switch recess okay down on the
bottom we find nothing over on the left
we find nothing here we find the tab so
that we can put it down on the table
without ruining the finish of the Y
drive unit itself oh yeah also of note
compared to competing solutions the Y
drive is fairly low capacity so that's
something we have to live with because
it is an SSD based device so that means
that in terms of durability I can very
comfortably drop the Y drive no and I
don't recommend doing this to yours yes
you have a one-year warranty but don't
like check it around but I can be
confident that even if the casing is
damaged if I drop it down on the
concrete the actual data inside of it
should be very safe because it is a
solid state based storage medium so this
particular one has a 16 gig SSD and if
there is a 32 gig available and I think
that pretty much covers everything I
wanted to say about the Y Drive so in
summary there's an app ok it allows you
to extend the storage of your iOS device
you can access it with up to 3 users at
a time for up to 4 hours and it is a
solid state based storage device which
means your data will be safe thanks for
