reason for that this is going to be a
bit of an unusual video from you today
while we do tackle DIY projects with
reasonable frequency we especially
lately haven't been particularly focused
on doing them correctly
so today's monitor painting guide will
probably come across a little weird on
the subject of guides let me know with
the like button below if you want to see
us tackle optimizing a 10 gigabit
network as a short guide it's something
I've been working on for a while for our
new office I'm just not sure if it needs
its own video
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click my
face now to try it for free so we kick
things off by finding a nice comfortable
place to disassemble our LG 34 um 67 nd
freesync capable ultra wide gaming
monitor beautiful day for painting
monitor they're actually did a full
review of it already
and you can check that out in the little
I in the top right corner of the screen
I thought this was a great candidate for
a paint job because while it's 75 Hertz
variable refresh rate panel has got the
proverbial business in the front the
rear of it is a little lacking in the
party in the back department the first
step was disassembling the display you
could paint a monitor by simply masking
off the screen imports and spraying it
but you wouldn't end up with a nice
finish and you'd risk damaging it so I
used LG's recycling disassembly guide to
take it apart starting with the screw on
the back then by using a plastic pry
tool which I quickly replaced with the
metal one even though that actually did
damage the plastic on the bottom a
little bit to get the clips released to
pull the backing off next the guide says
to remove the speaker so I pulled those
off then I started forging my own path
removing the arm that attaches the
monitor to the stand and the screws
around the outside of the edges of the
rear of the inside panel with this done
I was able to remove the clips at the
rear bottom and actually extract the
panel from the top / bottom / side bezel
as well as that little front fascia
piece which was able to pop off just
fine after that point so I put the panel
away safely I won't be needing that
until much later next it's time to work
on the plastic so I followed this guide
on automotive touch-up comm I know that
spray balms are not the best way to
paint something but I don't have and nor
do I have any interest in acquiring a
spray gun for a one-off project and
neither do a lot of people so we're
going to try it this way we needed
masking tape
prep solvent sandpaper and a scuff pad
tack cloth plastic parts adhesion
promoter sandable primer base coat gloss
clear coat and finally rubbing compound
for the finishing touches not actually
as expensive as it sounds when I list
all those things so I started by
cleaning off the plastic pieces with
soap and water although I suspect this
step is more relevant for super dirty
cars then I used prep solvent to ensure
it was clean and after that I used the
scuff pad to rough up the plastic a bit
to help the primary to hear better it
really seems like this step could and
probably should actually be done before
washing when you're working on something
like a monitor but honestly it's not
that much work after scuffing and
sanding in my case to remove a weird
line on the back panel to just wash it
down quickly one more time now before
applying any material you're going to
want to mask anything you don't want
paint on so just the control button at
the bottom for me and set up a decent
workspace obviously a spray booth with
no dust flow and a mask would be the
best way to keep dust out but I don't
have one of those so I made myself a
little all clove undercover in my garage
something that I ended up discovering
later that I really needed to improve
the first two coats are adhesion
promoter and the rules for applying this
are basically the same as any spray balm
20 centimeters or so away smooth
overlapping strokes press the nozzle
before actually being pointed at the
surface you're trying to paint and
release it once you've passed to avoid
drips and don't over apply on a single
coat or you'll get drips from that too
then finally always follow the recoating
instructions to ensure you don't bung
everything up if it says wait 15 minutes
before reapplying just wait don't touch
it
just wait after the adhesion promoter
it's time for primer at this stage you
can still make some mistakes I mean
obviously you want to do your best but
don't worry too much about it because
after three coats of primer you're going
to give it another
send with 600 grit sandpaper anyway
clean off those primed parts with water
and then use one of those sticky tack
rags to remove any dust and lint now you
need to step up your game
so our painting location wasn't good
enough and we didn't have an anti-static
treatment for our panels which means
dust was a real hassle for us over the
next few steps where every stupid little
mistake has a chance of showing up in
the finished product we were able to
help ourselves out a lot by covering our
work area with a tarp but even then we'd
get dust problems with almost every coat
the best advice I can give you now that
I'm finished the project though is no
matter how tempted you are don't try to
fix anything while the paint is wet wait
until the coat you're working on dries
and you can actually usually get little
bits of dust out with the tack rag and
even if you can't you're better off
having one very small problem than
several big ones and I was surprised at
how little of the junk that got stuck in
it shows up once you're done with
polishing so it took four coats of our
Lamborghini red Diablo whatever that
color is called
base coat to reach the desired evenness
of color so I had breakfast and then
came back to work on the clear coat
after the 30 minute interval that it
asks for this stuff is sticky and also
much easier to screw up than paint go
slow don't touch it and you'll be fine
it took four coats of clear for me to
reach the desired glossiness but your
mileage may vary and if you do more
coats of clear then you'll leave
yourself more room for polishing the
finished product so with the clear coat
done I left our parts out to dry in the
shade never let paint dry in the Sun or
work in the Sun for 24 hours before
returning to finish the project off so
all that's left at this point is take a
run at everything with some 1500 grit
sandpaper for removing any serious
orange peel and texture and then rubbing
compound to bring out the shine and that
does take a little while guys I was at
it for a couple of hours and really if
I'd gone for you know another six hour
first I could have gotten a better
result a really shiny result but
eventually we had to kind of go okay
it's time to put this back together and
find out if it even works and it turns
out yes it does and boy is she beautiful
okay I won't finish that I'll let you
guys be the judge but I think
considering the reasonable cost of the
paint and materials and the fact that
this mod was done in a total of eight to
ten hours I'm really pleased with my now
totally one-of-a-kind looking gaming
monitor I think to take it a step
further
I'd really like to stencil maybe not an
LG logo again but maybe like something
on the bottom here and I'd like to
stencil something on the back and like
matte black Plasti Dip or something that
would look sick but it's not terribly
critical and I'm really liking the shiny
smooth red of the entire monitor here I
consider this project to success and I
hope it inspires you guys to go paint
something it doesn't have to be a
monitor speaking of things that don't
have to be a monitor tink on they're the
mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first when you call them
and I've tried this you legitimately do
not speak to a robot you get put through
directly to a person and they're billing
is different to the average ting bill is
apparently only about $24 per month per
device but because it's paid for exactly
what you use you might kind of go of all
gee I don't know how much I'm going to
use every month but the solution is use
their calculator so head over to ting
excuse me
Linus ENCOM to try out the savings
calculator you enter your last few bills
from your current plan as well as how
much you're paying and then boom it
spits out and goes okay yeah you'll save
money on ting or oh no maybe you won't
and the best part is if you visit that
link then you can get $25 off a service
credit or towards a new device just for
using the link Wow amazing also if
you're worried about your existing
contract will cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks
so as Linus ENCOM to try it out today so
that's pretty much it guys thanks for
