year ago we ended up giving it a pretty
tepid sorta recommendation but since
then alex who writes most of our laptop
reviews started using it as his daily
driver and then just never stopped so
what is it that gives the surface laptop
that kind of staying power why is it
that Alex who can use any laptop he
wants would keep coming back to it and
why does Alex put double spaces after
periods in his writing memory Express is
the go-to place for your electronic
needs and services in Canada and they're
opening a new store in Victoria BC
they're hiring for all positions so
check them out at the link in the video
description
when your job description is literally
writer a good keyboard is crucial and I
think it's fair to say that the surface
laptop has one of the best if not the
best keyboard on the market there's
something about the way the keys go down
that just feels great it's crazy how
much tactile feedback they've been able
to get into such a contact device and
the Alcantara wrist rest makes typing
just that a little bit more comfortable
now we actually expressed concerns about
its long-term durability but I'm
actually very pleased to say that this
unit thank you
which has been subjected to some pretty
harsh conditions over the last year
hasn't yet shown any signs of wear below
the keyboard though is the first missed
opportunity of the surface laptop to the
touchpad is frosted glass topped it's
responsive it's accurate overall it's
great but even as only a very occasional
MacBook Pro user it is really hard to go
back to a small touchpad and I'd like to
see it expanded next time around one
thing that did get fixed this time
though is performance now for our
purposes the seventh gen dual-core
processor from last time
hasn't been a huge issue I mean we all
have desktops whenever we need more
horsepower but if this was your only
computer or even if you wanted to do
some light photo editing on the road
you'd probably be frustrated that
similarly thin devices have been
available for months with quad core
processors not anymore
Microsoft bumped the surface laptop to
to a quad-core 8th gen processor and
while they were at it they also can to
the entry-level 4 gig model to prevent
anyone buying such an otherwise premium
device from having a pretty bad time
running Windows 10 the entry-level unit
is now a totally different machine from
last years and it makes it much easier
for us to recommend it with confidence
while we're talking about great things
that are great the screen is great for
things like surfing the web and writing
in word the 3x2 aspect ratio lets you
see that much more of your work and when
you combine that
with excellent accurate color deep
blacks and the top-of-the-line touch
capabilities that we've come to expect
from Microsoft service lineup well it's
really hard to come up with complaints
for the screen that is unless your
favorite online content creator just
made the switch to an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio for their videos leaving you with
even more massive black bars than you
otherwise would have had above the
screen in what is obviously the correct
place you'll find the webcam which again
is about as good as they come and
implements Windows hello facial
recognition perfectly but timelines has
blasdell to even open I'm already signed
in and even though we've had other
windows hello I our laptops here they
have the camera below them and stuff so
it normally takes longer to register the
face with that said we still maintain
that being the best webcam on a laptop
is kind of like beating all the kids at
the local elementary school at
Foursquare like there's still a lot of
room for the entire industry to do
better in this category though I'm not
sure I can say the same about the build
quality Microsoft puts a lot of work
into the design of its devices and it
shows chassis flex is all but
imperceptible the speakers are great
considering their size and the battery
life is good enough to last through most
of if not quite all of the day and it
looks great doing it matte black baby
that is a welcome addition to the lineup
so okay sounds good then right let's all
run out and buy surface laptop twos they
didn't change much but if ain't broke
don't fix it yeah well actually they're
not well there was one thing that was
broke the one thing but nearly everyone
that reviewed the surface laptop
complained about was the craptastic
aisle and I mean I get it it's thin it's
light so having a whack ton of ports on
it isn't the easiest thing to do but
this isn't acceptable in 2018 yeah
Microsoft you do get a couple of points
for the taipei port it's nice to be able
to use a two-factor authentication key
or a mouse without immediately reaching
for a dog cool but then you immediately
take all those points crumple them up in
a ball
turn light them on fire and throw them
off of a cliff because why did you
include a mini display port port who
even cares about this it has its
purposes but if you've got to use a
dongle anyway where's the USB type-c
port I mean sure you got your magnetic
surface Kinect docking port over here
which lets you add a bunch more
connectors and stuff but you know
Microsoft you know what other port lets
people dock their laptop and charge it
at the same time Thunderbolt 3 you've
created a thin enlight here that has the
potential to be basically perfect and
the high price that you command for it
would be so much easier to swallow if
there were at least a single Thunderbolt
3 port on the side then I could attach
it to an inexpensive dongle for as many
ports as I want I could attach it to an
eg PU turning this thing into a
legitimately decent gaming machine I
could use a super-fast external SSD as
it is now though the surface laptop -
pretty much just makes my job harder
with Thunderbolt if someone asked me hey
Linus I want a thin and light laptop
what should I get my answer would be
simple if you're cheap get a gram if you
have a bit of extra cash and you like to
look fancy get a surface laptop without
it though well the Dell XPS 13 and the
Razer Blade stealth come back into
consideration so at the end of the day
alex is gonna keep using the surface
laptop because the screen and the
keyboard are second to none
also I think secretly has kind of a
Microsoft part on but once again we can
only give it a tepid recommendation
rather than like an all-out enthusiastic
like just throwing your wallets at it
immediately one ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
if you ever do have an issue and you
call them you don't speak to a robot you
get put through directly to a person and
it doesn't cost extra in fact with ting
you pay only for what you use with the
average ting bill coming in at just 23
bucks a month per device if you're stuck
in a contract and switch to ting bill
over 25% of your cancellation fee up to
$75 and they've got lower mobile data
rates than ever with data just $10 per
gig beyond the second gig to find out
how much you'd save on ting head to
Linus 2018 ting comm and try out their
savings calculator you just enter your
last couple bills and find out how much
you'd save on ting then when you decide
to sign up use our link again that's
Linus 2018 ting comm and you'll get 25
bucks in service credit or towards a new
device so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
kind of like this one but not quite and
our community forum which you should
totally join ten points if you can find
the spots where I screwed up based on
the sand in the hourglass where were the
cuts in this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
