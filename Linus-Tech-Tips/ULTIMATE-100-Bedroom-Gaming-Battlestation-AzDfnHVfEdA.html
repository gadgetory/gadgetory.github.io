a video featuring their brand-new
Genesis system you can learn more about
it at the link below but in a nutshell
this latest version was just unveiled at
CES and our config rocks an 18 core
Extreme Edition dual tempered glass side
panels dual water-cooled GT X 1080 T
eyes and four radiators for cooling
not bad for eight thousand eight hundred
and eighty one dollars lordy
so a machine like this deserves nay
demands a proportionally dank battle
station to complement it so with our
middle school level woodworking skills
we set out to build a custom desk for
the Genesis let there be RGB light
now with this kind of power 4k gaming is
well within our reach but plopping a 4k
monitor on a table and calling it a
battle station is not the LTTE way so we
decided to use one of the del s 718 QL
4k laser projectors that we reviewed
recently instead but opting for an ultra
short throw projector as your display
will introduce some key constraints to a
project like this first we realized we
would need a really deep tabletop since
not only with the projector itself be
taking up a lot of key real estate but
if we ended up too close to our screen
we were concerned we'd feel less like a
badass power user and more like a tennis
spectator but finding a sufficiently
deep and wide desk at a reasonable price
isn't easy or is it this sliding door
from our bedroom set is 34 inches deep 7
feet wide and doesn't have any pesky
door like features like a knob hole so
we picked up another one of them for 20
bucks and spent then another 20 on some
semi-gloss black paint to complement our
tower the second thing about using a
projector like this is that the image
ends up being quite a bit higher than
you would typically want and we didn't
want to have to lean way back in our
chair just to see the browser search bar
the solution a phone book on the chair I
mean realistically it's 2018 what else
are you gonna use it for actually I'm
just kidding by cutting a recess in the
desk and then hanging a dropped shelf we
were actually able to get the top of the
projector flush with the desktop which
looks sick and gets the screen down as
low as it can be to create our mounting
system we simply used some long bolts
and a shelf from Ikea which could
actually easily be replaced by a regular
piece of wood to
save a buck since you'll never see it
constraint number three where are we
gonna put the tower normally we'd want
to show off a box like this on top of
the desk but even with a short throw
projector and a super wide table we'd be
risking cutting off the view of either
the system tray or the start button and
letting the Genesis sit on the floor is
totally out of the question so since our
giant desk didn't have any legs at this
point and since any potential legs would
have to be pretty beefy to be
proportional we decided to build a
custom cabinet for the tower that would
double as a table leg so we went to Ikea
and bought two alex cabinets for $80
apiece one that we fully assembled and
endowed with upside-down feet to rest
the tabletop on and another that we
completely butchered so that our towers
good looks and hot air could shine and
blow through finally we added some black
anodized aluminum trim to visually unify
our ragtag assortment of pieces not to
mention to cover up the janky lines that
came with freehand in the jigsaw which I
guess brings us perfectly to the blue
personal let's just say that building
this desk was a learning experience for
James the first lesson was that you can
tell if a door is hollow or not by how
much it weighs and how cheap it is and
if you find yourself accidentally in
possession of a hollow door that you're
expecting to hang a 33 pound projector
from you can beef it up by ripping out
the cardboard ballasts and inserting
slabs of wood to basically act as like
big reinforcing washers lesson number
two use molding that says wide is the
material you're trying to cover up the
walls of our Alex cabinets are three
quarters of an inch thick
but the trim we ended up with is only
half an inch leaving a lot of exposed
wood and nothing is more awkward than
exposed wood lesson number three don't
use too much glue unless you want to
find your finished desk ruined by
hardened gorilla glue bubbles that take
the paint off when you cut off finally
lesson number four a projector really
looks a lot better on a purpose-built
projector screen so to do this over we
we recommend that upgrade especially if
you were trying to recreate this setup
with a less bright projector however
with all of that said as a
proof-of-concept this turned out more
than okay we put together a simple plan
for how pretty much anyone can set up a
giant comfortable custom desk for just a
few hundred bucks and we have a bad-ass
new addition to our new set not to
mention our selection of off hours
leisure activities here at the office so
big thanks to Origen for sponsoring this
video their Genesis system absolutely
chews through anything we can throw at
it at 4k and looks great doing it the
front i/o including ten gigabit USB 3.1
is discreetly hidden behind a sliding
cover and the tempered glass side panels
are easily swappable with tooless hinges
and swanky magnetic clasp of course if
you're into the all aluminum look Origen
will paint or laser edge any logo or
custom design your heart desires and
before we go we should probably also
throw an honorable mention to Dell for
providing the projector
ergo direct for providing this awesome
chair that works really well with a nice
tall screen and nano leaf for hooking us
up with some brilliant decor so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
