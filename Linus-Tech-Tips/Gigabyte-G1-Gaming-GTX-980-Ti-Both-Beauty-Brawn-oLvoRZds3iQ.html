was the brief overview and introduction
of the gigabyte g1 gaming 980ti at
Computex 2015 and at that time we could
obviously see the card aesthetically but
the effectiveness of the cooling and the
performance of the card especially when
its various clock speeds were
unannounced was a mystery now that we
have the card in hand it's time to go
over everything in more detail and get
the under the hood look at this bad boy
to see what it can really do by the way
Brannon and I visited an amazing new
tech mall in Taipei and took a bunch of
fancy b-roll footage and whatnot and
we'd like to show you guys what's up
with that tech mall because it's
honestly kind of fantastic but Lian is
rather unsure about it so slam that like
button and let them know you want to see
it
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try it for free first up performance
hardware gigabytes premier gtx 980ti is
rocking a stock base clock speed of the
2,816 CUDA core equipped GM 200 chip of
eleven hundred and ninety and a boost
clock speed of twelve hundred and
ninety-one although this isn't really
what you actually get in a good way
though don't worry if that's confusing
we'll get more into the performance
later on by the way there are two modes
for this card gaming mode and OC mode
even if you're not overclocking just run
the card in OC mode gaming mode just
nerfs your basement boost clock by about
fifty megahertz compared to OC mode and
that's just silly gigabyte was a little
less aggressive in the memory department
running the stock amount of ram at 6
gigabytes at a speed of about seven
thousand and ten megahertz the g1 gaming
980 TI is cooled by the same 3 X 600
watt cooling system as the previous g1
gaming 980 but it has some various
aesthetic changes which I think look
great first up they added some silver
coloring to the outside of the coolers
front which looks really sharp and a lot
more active in the previous all-black
design but could also potentially
conflict with some color setup builds I
think but almost all cases will be fine
with it due to the still generally muted
color palette then we have the LED
backlit windforce logo on the top of the
card which isn't technically full RGB
but can be set to white yellow blue
purple red green or teal to match almost
any builds you might have you set these
colors through the gigabyte OC guru to
utility software which you can download
from the support and download section of
the gigabyte g1 gaming 980ti website on
each side of this backlit logo is a
button to stop the fans if you want to
move into a silent operating mode and
will turn the main logo LEDs off and
turn the white LEDs behind said
respective buttons on I do have a gripe
with this some people might bring up
that having a button on your graphics
card is not can be all that helpful for
most people that will probably have this
card inside of a
computer case and they don't want to
take off their side panel and press the
button inside their computer when they
can just control it with software but
I'm not going to complain about added
features when they don't really hurt
anything my problem with this is that
one of the button says silent and the
other button says stop please if you're
going to have two different buttons that
do the exact same thing at least name
and label them the same way anyways
moving on this card also comes with
gigabytes flex display technology which
allows you to plug in up to four
monitors at the same time using some
various plug groupings you do this by
choosing an additional DVID or two
additional DisplayPort plugs over your
already existing dvi-i DisplayPort and
HDMI plugs a great feature for adapting
to your various potential display
adapter needs the windforce 3x cooler
has three fans five eight millimeter
heat pipes and one six millimeter heat
pipe the fan blades have a special
striped design or stripped design that
gigabyte claims to increase airflow by
23% compared to traditional fans and
also reduces air turbulence other than
that we have a fairly expected setup on
top of the right-hand side of the card
you have your standard set of dual eight
pin power connectors SLI fingers on the
left side and a black PCB hidden under
all of those fancy aesthetic
improvements that we mentioned earlier
we don't have an acoustic chambered yet
maybe in the new office - maybe I don't
know either way it wasn't that bad under
load and was able to even keep the card
quite cool with an ambient temperature
of 32 freaking degrees Celsius just
before we get into the forward section
I'd like to remind you guys that NVIDIA
has some tech inside this card including
classics like SLI CUDA and GeForce
experience and all the new stuff that
was introduced with the gtx 980ti like
g-sync full screen windowed mode support
DirectX 12 underscore one support and V
our rendering optimizations for
rendering fewer unnecessary pixels which
you can learn more about elias's
original 980ti launch video by clicking
here overclocking the g1 gaming 980 TI
was odd but unsurprising i mentioned
earlier that it had an eleven hundred
and ninety stock clock and
whose clock of 1291 but in actuality
without any tweaking or changes on my
end it was able to achieve a boost clock
of 1370 all on its own
that's quite an improvement over the
already existing boost clock this has
been going on for a while now if you
haven't noticed yet and we're actually
looking into making a video comparing a
whole bunch of the same car to see all
their various boost clocks on their own
but it's a little difficult to round up
enough cards to make the sample size
actually mean anything so don't hold
your breath waiting for that one for
actual overclocking manually it did
pretty well to a core clock actual of
1480 but one problem I did have was some
weird voltage issues my card got upset
when I applied any additional voltage to
it at all which is a little weird and I
would expect most people to get around
fifteen twenty five to fifteen fifty
with this card as my overclocked power
draw and thermals really didn't get that
high due to the voltage causing the car
to crash prematurely in terms of
performance it did really well even
beating out the previous king the Titan
X add stock speeds and absolutely
running away with things when
overclocked in every single game that we
tested with no outstanding issues
anywhere in conclusion the Titan X just
got wrecked for gaming we all knew it
wouldn't last although I must admit this
was a little faster than I had expected
having the g1 gaming 980 I walk all over
the Titan even when not overclocked was
damn impressive and master off so we've
got a drop for you guys today visit drag
ups slash Linus tech tips and actually
this is a deal from our buds over at
Sennheiser this is the Gafoor ma 0 I
think they mean game but it's leet-speak
or something along those lines it's a
pretty awesome gaming headset from
Sennheiser one of the hallmarks of
Sennheiser gaming headsets is they're
excellent boom marks boom marks boom
microphones and you can get this one for
a hundred and seventy nine instead of
two hundred and forty nine which is the
MSRP as long as at least five people
jump on to the drop which is good news
for you if you want to get it at that
minimum price because as of the time of
filming this there's already 15 people
on
so yeah basically our work is done and
we haven't even started what work are we
doing well we want to tell you guys
about master opcom great site they
basically run out and find great
products and then they kind of go okay
if we can find enough people to buy this
thing how low can you go manufacturers
and distributors come in and they say
okay well if you can get 10 to buy it
you get this price if you get this many
even get an even lower price and the
whole community works together for
basically a coordinated group buying so
you can visit draw tups slash Linus tech
tips for whatever deal it is that we're
on about or you can just browse the math
drop site where you can find all kinds
of cool stuff from gaming headsets to
keyboards to knives to well you get my
point we picked up an audio recorder
they're not that long ago so uh check it
out now awesome site become a member
it's free until you start buying a bunch
of stuff then it's not free that's the
trap thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit the
