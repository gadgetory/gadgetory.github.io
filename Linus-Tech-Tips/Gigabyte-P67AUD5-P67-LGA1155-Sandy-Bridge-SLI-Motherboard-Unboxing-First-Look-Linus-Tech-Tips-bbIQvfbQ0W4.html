AUD five this is a core i7 core i5
compatible but this motherboard is only
compatible with generation two chips on
socket 1155 so it features the Intel p67
chipset and it also features some
gigabyte innovations such as delivering
maximum CPU power so what maximum CPU
power means is that if you can provide
the cooling for it you can provide the
power to get the maximum overclock out
of your CPU so this board even though
it's not their top tier board they do
have a ud7 board as well the features 20
phase power which is far more than I've
seen on you d 5 level boards in the past
it also features other gigabyte
innovations such as their ultra durable
3 which is there thicker copper PCB as
well as their 333 acceleration which
means it's got USB 3 SATA 36 gigabit per
second as well as their USB power 3 X
this is one that I'm personally very
fond of because it allows you to use a
hub plug in as many as three fully
powered USB devices and still not run
out of power last but not least they've
got their on/off charge which allows you
to charge devices even while the system
is powered off you've got their dual
BIOS technology which makes it pretty
much impossible to corrupt your BIOS and
not be able to recover it so let's go
ahead and get this board opened up it
has a three year warranty in the US and
Canada and I'm actually not sure what
the warranty is elsewhere in the world
so you'll have to kind of research that
one on your own we have a Dolby Home
Theater sticker inside first of all and
next we have the i/o shield which is
conveniently color-coded so here's a
hint right now we already know that
we're going to have four USB 3.0 ports
on the back panel we have some gigabyte
colored the traditional blue SATA cables
so we have two straight and two right
angle this this is really important
warning socket 1155 is not the same as
1156 you cannot plug an 1156 chip into
an 1155 board you will damage
either the board or the chip or both
here's your utility DVD don't use this
download the latest off the gigabyte
website as well as a user's manual which
I think you can also download off the
gigabyte website but not necessary
here's a multilingual installation guide
book where they give you some basics on
how to install components in your board
really though if you want to know how to
build a system i probably wouldn't stick
to just that little guide i would
actually look up my system building
guide on my NCIX comm channel and i
actually walk you through every step i
know it's a half hour long video but
it's still very helpful here's an sli
bridge which tells us that this board
even though it wasn't anywhere on the
outside of the box actually supports not
only SLI but also crossfire X so this is
a fully duel PCI Express compatible
board and while it does have three pcie
16x slots and it probably will work in a
three-way configuration bear in mind
that there's only so many PCIe lanes on
the p67 a chipset so you know what I'll
get into that a little bit more once
we're looking at the PCIe lanes why
don't we look at the overall layout of
the board first of all matte black PCB
love it this is a great move from
gigabyte it looks phenomenal it's great
weather you have don't have a system
window because then what do you care or
if you do have a system window it looks
really good especially if you're using
like lights because a matte black PCB
won't reflect and glare off of it it'll
just look really dark and you'll be able
to light up the things that you want to
see which is usually not your
motherboard mind you with a board like
this I might want to see it so the
cameraman is having a look at the 20
phase power right now as well as the
cooling on the vrm as well as the
chipset so we have heat pipes connecting
all those different coolers we have our
socket right here in the middle as I
said before this is an LGA 1155 socket
so you got support for the ever popular
core i5 2500 k as well as the i7 2600 k
anything on an 1155 socket will work in
here but bear in mind this is a p67
board so that means there are no display
outputs on the back so you will not have
support for onboard video you will have
to add a dead
graphics card in terms of power we've
got our 8-pin connector up here on the
top left exactly where it belongs as
well as our 24-pin connector over here
on the right also exactly where it
belongs p67 all these boards are going
to have full support for dual-channel
ddr3 memory and there's those logos we
were missing on the front of the board
crossfire X as well as SLI so yes they
are fully supported I'm not making
things up down here on the side of the
board we have some fluff and then we
also have for say two to three gigabit
per second ports as well as to say 236
gigabit per second ports so these are
actually running off of the intel
chipset now which is a pretty big
improvement and that makes me pretty
happy next we have our front panel plugs
we have two front panel USB ports we
have Wow two front panel USB 3.0 headers
so that means this board supports a
total of eight USB 3.0 ports very very
cool then we have a firewire port as
well as our front panel audio in its
traditional gigabyte location over here
right behind the audio jacks so let's
have a look at the slot layout we have
two PCIe oh yeah it has onboard power
Thank You cameraman it also has an
onboard reset switch as well as a clear
CMOS which I love this location for
these buttons because unlike the ones
down at the very bottom edge of the
board if you plug a graphics card in
okay so let's say you have a graphics
card here well these aren't covered you
can actually you can actually access
these so that's pretty cool the power
power word is upside down wonder if
somebody wonder if somebody put that on
wrong but because it doesn't really
matter um you know what hey if you guys
have a UD 5 board please post a comment
and let me know if your power switch is
right side up or if yours is upside down
like this one it won't affect the
functionality since it's just shorting
it out and it's not it doesn't matter
the polarity but yeah please pretty
interesting ok so we have two PCIe 1x
slots to PCI slots and three pcie 16x
slots but I want to tell you guys this
one you can see right here you can
actually see the wires is wired for full
pcie 16x this will run at 60 neck
if you have one card installed this one
right here you can clearly see is wired
only 48 x this one is active as soon as
you plug a card into it and that will
reduce the available bandwidth to this
guy 28 x so if you're running two cards
you're going to be an 8x8 x-mode this
last one is actually only wired for pci
e 4x and so really a three-way graphics
card configuration is not really optimal
for this board I would probably use this
for some other kind of expansion card
like a raid card or yeah like an ocz
revodrive would be a perfect example of
what I would use this guy for so if you
are running dual graphics available you
will have one pci e 1x slot one pci slot
for any legacy devices as well as one
pci e 4x slot so let's move around to
the back and have a look at the i/o
shield we have one of these legacy ps2
ports big fan of that actually I still
like to see it we have one two three
four five six USB 2.0 ports and actually
hold on hold on let me double check I
can't tell yeah yeah okay so these are a
SATA USB combo ports okay so that means
we have to e SATA ports two firewire
optical as well as coaxial audio out and
we have four USB 3.0 ports remember
that's a total of eight Gigabit Ethernet
as well as 7.1 audio out thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the gigabyte
p67 a UD 5 LGA 1155 motherboard oh hey
here's one more cool thing about this
board look at that they used actual
proper spring-loaded screws with with
plastic washers to ensure that there's
no issues with the with the hardware
that they're using to fix all of these
chips at coolers and whatnot I'm not a
big fan of pushpins love to see the
little extra effort put in by gigabyte
on those kinds of fine finishing touches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
