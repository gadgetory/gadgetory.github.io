Hubert rocked dual GTX 1080s and Intel
Core i 9 processor and hardline liquid
cooling crammed into a pretty old antic
case so how do we one-up something like
that haha meet Hubert's brother Dale
sure Dale is a bit smaller and way older
but don't let his outward appearance
fool you because this build
sponsored by Intel is about as fast as a
gaming PC can be in 2017
we knew that for a small form-factor
sleeper we needed a really unique case
as a starting point and our good friends
over at free geek Vancouver were able to
provide just that they have everything
there
this Morrow designs md3 hails from 1982
making it older than literally everyone
in our office and it has clearly seen
better days with its dual floppy bass
and 8-bit operating system this puppy
would have cost about three thousand
dollars back in its day but it hasn't
worked in years and even if it did it is
basically useless now cracking it open
other than this massive dust bunny it's
really not that bad though all things
considered so with the internals removed
it was time to do some test fitting now
unfortunately a full sized high end GPU
is just a bit too long to fit but ZOTAC
had exactly the right medicine this mini
GT X 1080 Ti with a water cooling block
so I guess we'll have to water cool the
system now then that's not going to be
easy in such a small space and we're
gonna be limited to a thick single
radiator but we're hoping that that's
going to be enough which brings us to
the best part of every mod angle
grinding from the factory there's
mounting for literally no modern
hardware so all of the cutouts for i/o
and mounting had to be created from
scratch for the motherboard here it was
basically a case of cut a bunch out with
the angle grinder then come in with the
Dremel for a while and finally finish
off with a hand file this one hole here
actually took close to four hours since
there was no going back if we slipped up
now in 1982 120 mil fans for pcs were
not a thing at all so we needed a new
fan hole with some help from this cable
management tie we cut it out using the
cannibal and then at this stage we also
drilled lots of holes for everything to
mount on the bottom we decided to
position the GPU above the motherboard
this ended up be
a bit tricky because originally we were
going to use this 3d printed bracket but
it was really ugly and not in like a
cool vintage way so we opted to very
slowly create mounting points for the
backplate and holes for the i/o to
fasten it directly to the back of the
chassis instead bringing us to test fit
time and it looks good now for the front
of the floppy drives just to be sure and
oh crap
oh I guess that interferes with the
radiator no worries though just a little
bit of hole and viggen mint and Dale is
off to get a fresh coat of paint but
only on the inside on that topic let's
talk about what's under the hood for the
CPU we went with Intel's Core i7 8700 K
making d√°il as good as it gets for
gaming for our motherboard we chose an
Asus z3 70 I gaming with a Samsung nvme
SSD underneath this sexy heatsink then
to keep the CPU cool we're using an ek
supremacy full nickel block we decided
against an acrylic block since it'll
actually have to help hold up the
graphics card and also because you won't
be able to see it anyway for our
radiator we went with a 120 millimeter
single rad from alpha cool that is a
massive 60 millimeters thick and then
for our pump we're using an ek SPC 60
with a built in cylindrical reservoir we
went with these super sexy white
fittings and black acrylic tube both
provided by bits power for a sleek
monochrome look the first Bend was one
of the hardest since it needs to come
around our PCI Express extender and then
make a funky Bend too so we ended up
just making a little steak out of black
fittings in hopes that nobody would
notice right here the bending wasn't
finished yet though
next this 90 degree from the pump to the
res and after that a nice long tube from
the GPU back to the radiator both of
which were made the perfect length with
a bit of help from the bench sander now
we just need to do a bunch of little
touch-ups to make it perfect like
splicing together the led
for the drives so they can be attached
to the hard drive header soldering on
the front panel connector that we
borrowed from another case so that the
og power button and LED would still work
gently removing the print and modem
ports massaging them with the sander
before inserting them and then finally
screwing and double-sided taping the
Front's to the floppy drives back in
their original positions the insides we
finished off with this sweet purple
cathode from bits power and unbelievable
800 watt 80-plus titanium SF XL modular
power supply from silverstone and some
cleanup from ivan the cable management
king perfect now let's fill the loop
making sure to use a secondary power
supply so that in the unlikely event
that we have a spill seriously you guys
forgot a plug on the radiator oh man I
mean it at least it wasn't out in the
open I'm an idiot
yes but now you're not alone my friend
so my team of skilled boaters remove the
rad added a plug and tightened
everything down aha no I leaked it ed
what are you guys even doing this time
the tubing is full no veries though what
you're looking at right now is a
perfectly legitimate strategy for
emptying a loop by the way yes perfectly
legitimate totally not weird
so after swapping out some of the
fittings third time's a charm
we were finally leak-free to see how
Dale runs and performance wise oh it
runs
idle temps are in the 20s and then under
full synthetic load on the CPU and GPU
for half an hour with the lid closed
Dale held steady at 80 degrees with the
CPU still turbo Eng - 4 gigahertz on all
six cores though it should be noted that
he did get a little loud in this
scenario as for games though here things
got even more impressive Dale in spite
of his looks can drag race with it
any Challenger he is one of the fastest
small form factor computers on the
market with frames per second in the
hundreds on ultra and even during heavy
extended gaming sessions he stayed
reasonably quiet with GPU temperatures
maxing out at 53 degrees
so let's bask then in the glory of Dale
and look out for our next addition to
the sleeper family Margaret

subscribe maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we've featured
how about a core i7 processor even if
you can't get this case to put it in at
the link in the video description also
