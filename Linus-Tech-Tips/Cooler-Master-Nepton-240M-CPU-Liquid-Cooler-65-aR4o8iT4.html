radical concept water coolers aren't new
prefilled water coolers aren't new and
ones from cooler master aren't even new
but they're still pretty proud of the
neptune 240m they're all like yeah it's
got high quality included fans it's got
a completely cooler master designed and
manufactured pump with great quality we
put a five-year warranty on it and all
that stuff so let's find out that if
it's as good as it sounds on paper by
the way speaking of things that sound
our momentum in ear earphone review is
coming soon so make sure you're
subscribed so you don't miss that roll
the intro Corsair Gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color per key backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more on the surface there's not
much to differentiate the Neptune 240
and from other premium dual 120
millimeter fan liquid coolers the CPU
block and pump combo unit features a
flat machined copper base plate on the
bottom with a white LED lit Coolermaster
logo on top and two side mounted swivel
fittings that connect to the
pre-attached fluorinated ethylene
propylene tubing that appears to be
closer to three eighths inch internal
diameter than a quarter inch but manages
this wider flow path without any extra
susceptibility to kinking very nice the
radiator it's connected to is a fairly
standard aluminum finned 27 millimeters
thick dual 120 millimeter affair with
what I would describe as moderate fin
density so for the quiet freaks out
there it should be suitable for use with
low rpm fans as long as they deliver
high static pressure even at low rpm
which leads us to the fans these things
are actually a fantastic upgrade over
the fence that Coolermaster used to
bundle with their Neptune coolers they
run it anywhere from 800 to 2,400 rpm
they were extremely quiet at 1,100 rpm
the setting that we standardize on for
our performance testing and on top of
having square frames which allows them
to
ceil better against the radiator for
improved static pressure they have this
included rubber gasket in the box that
further reduces vibration and air
leakage
I'd say my only complaint about their
new Silencio fans is that you don't seem
to be able to buy the standalone you can
only get them with the cooler because
they're pretty darn good installation
was a breeze on LGA 2011 the pump is
efficient enough to be powered by a fan
header on your motherboard which makes
life a little bit easier and the
mounting hardware is both solid you know
and easy to use so if I had to make one
criticism here I guess it would be that
the tubing runs felt a little bit long
for me but users with larger cases may
be very thankful that the tubing is a
little bit on the longer side so your
mileage may vary which leads us to
performance yes performance was actually
very good
the Neptune 240m is competitive with
pretty much anything else on the playing
field including even Swift xh2 20 X
expandable ail but at a lower price and
with more flexible mounting options like
Swift x1 because the pump and reservoir
are on the radiator can only be mounted
like this way and this way only whereas
the Neptune can kind of be positioned
however you want it's just it comes
inherently with the pump being on the
CPU and not having a reservoir it should
be noted though that it does all this
without the expandability that Swift
tech solution affords where you can
start throwing in graphics card blocks
and stuff like that one thing of note
here is that upgrading to Noctua n ff12
fans does as it always seems to improve
the performance but not so dramatically
this time that we've considered them a
necessary upgrade for potential buyers
the ones in the box are a very solid
option with nice sleeved 4-pin pwm
connectors and all that good stuff
so overall the Neptune 240 M is a winner
which is a relief for me because we've
been running ads for it on our videos
for a little while now and it's always
refreshing to know that the stuff we're
advertising even if we're not
specifically endorsing it also happens
to kick butt I mean I hate it when you
guys buy stuff that isn't as good as it
could
something Dee speaking of things we
advertise that kick butt man that was a
great Segway
it's Blizzcon time again and intel has
some pretty awesome stuff going on in
there their booth is located near the
hearthstone stage and they're going to
be showcasing the latest and greatest
tech from Intel so you guys might
remember that last year hearthstone with
touch launched at Blizzcon and Intel was
showing off tablets with hearthstone
touch running so that's probably also
going to be there it's a pretty safe bet
especially with their new Core M
processors available they're going to of
course have gaming rigs with an emphasis
on like you know high res gaming high
performance gaming if they just launched
haswell-e
back around the PAX prime time frame so
they're going to have like six core and
eight core gaming rigs going on up in
there with ddr4 they've got a screen app
where attendees can come by and take
pictures in front of it they're going to
have twitch streamers streaming at their
booth this is something that they've
done before it's pretty darn cool if you
want to meet some of your you know
favorite twitch personalities that
happen to be there they're going to be
offering some deals through new egg on
Anna soos ROG laptop the lenovo y50 4k
gaming laptop and the lenovo horizon 2
27-inch all-in-one so the promo codes
are available in the Intel Blizzcon
thread on the forum that's linked in the
video description and the codes expire
December 31st so you don't actually have
to buy anything the second you could be
a present for the holiday season or it
could even be something to spend like if
your parents and relatives loved you a
lot more than mine ever did something to
spend your Christmas money on after the
Christmas season
so guys I think that pretty much wraps
it up like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment if your feelings are more
complicated than this check the link in
the video description to support us if
you think that that's a worthwhile thing
to do you can give us a monthly
contribution buy a cool t-shirt like
this one or just change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
so we get a small kickback whenever you
buy water coolers thanks again for
watching and as always don't forget to
