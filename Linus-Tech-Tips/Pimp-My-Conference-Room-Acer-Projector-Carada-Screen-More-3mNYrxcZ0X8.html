pretty interesting little project this
is our new conference room board room
meeting room whatever it is you want to
call it and up until now it is basically
had a chair that was left over from
chair racing the built-in bench seating
that we talked about in some of the
moving vlogs a mini fridge and a table
in it but the table's pretty cool
because it's going to allow us to tech
out this room in a way that will make it
great for having meetings and looking at
projections and all that kind of stuff
which is appropriate because we're going
to be using a projector on that wall and
we are going to turn it into actually
kind of a sick little gaming space so
come along for the ride as we pimp out
our conference room
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so it starts
with better seating we reached out to
our buds over at max anomic who actually
outfitted the rest of the office with
chairs already and they are sending us
their slightly less gamer looking like
there's no orange on them but definitely
comfortable office comfort chairs to kit
out the other three sides of the table
that don't have built-in seating next up
Kurata
graciously sent us a projector screen
and this thing is flippin huge you know
for so everyone can see those charts and
projections and our meetings and finally
oh wow I just dinged the wall that's
okay we're going to put a projector
screen there and finally a sirs H 7550
ST DLP projector is going to be handling
well projection duties this thing was
sent to us a billion years ago when I
told Acer hey we're thinking about
moving but we need a projector for our
new boardroom and they were like yeah
but you just make sure you get the video
done in a timely manner now they didn't
stay that last part which is good
because I didn't so this puppy's got
three HDMI inputs one of which is on the
inside for a streaming dongle like a
chromecast it's even got a little USB
power port in there it's got its typical
power in and we've got our power plug on
the ceiling to go along with that but
hold on a second Linus what about HDMI
you don't have an HDMI port in the
ceiling do you no I do not but I do have
a pretty cool table so to go along with
the 3d glasses yes we have a 3d
projector for our conference room they
also sent over their Wireless HD kit
this is a 60 gigahertz Wireless HDMI kit
that I'm hoping will be low latency
enough for gaming I need prob
presentations so basically what you do
is you plug your laptop into the power
ports that are built into the table the
HDMI and LAN ports that are built into
the table and then we're going to have
our transmitter on the bottom of the
table so you don't have to run any wires
you just plug in 50 bop
and you are streaming hopefully in very
low latency to the projector so let's
test it out shall we
so putting together the projector frame
was pretty straightforward
you basically just screw the thing into
the thing you put a couple of mounting
brackets for the wall rails onto it and
then you realize that karada doesn't
actually provide the screws for the wall
brackets themselves so because we're
using metal studs here I am going to
have to either go find out if we have
any screws that are appropriate for
mounting something heavy to metal studs
or I'm gonna have to go obtain some of
them so we have obtained the tools we
need a tape measure some metal screws
drill some drill bits a level and a
pencil and now we need to figure out
where exactly we are going to put it
okay so we have a tough decision to make
Center for the area where people will be
seating seated or Center on the wall now
is it mainly brandon what you making
I'll go see a Center for seating it's
gonna look weird though cuz we're gonna
have like four inches of space here and
like today I mean I won't even be
centered it still won't be centered
sometimes I just need someone to say my
idea back to me so I can realize how
stupid it sounds I can really use a
bladder
four inches how about that okay true one
and 48 inches from where you want the
top got its mark so stud say hopefully
this a piece of stud finder works it's
working just fine okay nothing is a for
easy when your line is and you write
nothing down mm-hmm it's okay because I
remembered 103 and a half so getting all
the frame mounting hardware on the wall
was actually pretty straightforward as
long as you're pretty handy with a
measuring tape so basically the way it
works is you've got your two rails on
the top end to end and then you sit the
hooks on the frame on top of that and
then these bottom ones these bottom ones
are tricky because if you don't align it
just right it won't work because you
might be thinking well hold on a second
unless you slide it on how's it going
there you actually have to stretch the
frame down under them then the whole
thing is hooked but of course now we
have to take the whole thing down and
put the actual screen on because I just
put it up here for a test fit so we need
to do this okay so the clip for that is
aimed for that team so the process of
clipping the frame working your way
around the outside is what tensions the
screen material and gives it a nice flat
surface
so with the screen itself tensioned
and placed on to the back of the frame
it's time to pick up the frame again
take it back into the boardroom and hang
it for real this time
so with the screen stretched over the
frame it was almost as easy to mount it
on the wall hangers requiring just a
little bit more force than last time to
stretch it over the bottom hanger once
it was on though it's pretty much flush
against the wall just a fraction of a
centimeter of clearance around every
edge and looks pretty darn sharp okay
and actually the decision that we wanted
to make earlier about whether to Center
it in the room or whatever was sort of a
moot point because you could slide it a
fair pit after the fact tear assembly
was pretty straightforward nothing I've
never done before took about 20 minutes
per chair and the end result is what you
see right here it is starting to look
like a boardroom in here but of course
now it's time to fire up the projector
and see what the difference is between
our conference room and most conference
rooms
all right there we go not too shabby
so projector alignment can be a bit of a
nightmare you Keystone when you should
have twisted you twist when you should
have moved it to the right you tilt it
up when oh no you're broken the Keystone
now uh but I did eventually get it
pretty darn close to where we want it to
be in terms of filling the frame without
cutting off things like the Start menu a
huge disadvantage that people who
intends to use their projectors for
presentations and windows versus people
who want to watch movies where you can
sacrifice a sixteenth of an inch of the
edge of a movie whereas you cannot
really do that with your Start menu we
got it to the point where it needed to
be and then moment of truth because
quite frankly if you look at it in
comparison to the screen running on the
table next to it and not that impressive
yeah projectors they don't really shine
so to speak until you turn out the light
and that is exactly what we did and boy
is it an experience in here now okay you
know what let me see if anyone else is
still here I need a few volunteers to
play an Android game on the gigantic
projector upstairs
yes quicker to train a monkey okay so
why is pick up skip the tutorial
everyone everyone there there we go okay
free-for-all don't touch sticky bombs if
you don't want to blow up you guys
should probably team up on duck yeah so
Taryn you're just gonna throw mines
until I just I don't know what to do
Wow there are mines everywhere cheeks
yeah no I'm uh I'm super pleased with
how this turned out oh wow everyone stay
away from Terran Oh
okay so in a word that was freaking
awesome
but what we still don't know is whether
our wireless dongle will allow us to
just plug consoles in down here and have
a low latency gaming experience up there
once we ceiling mount the projector at a
later date so to validate the latency of
the wireless dongle I'm going to be
using our tried-and-true makey makey
test methodology so I'm recording in
slow-mo on the iPhone and then I'm going
to use the makey makey to touch these
two wires together generating a left
click so I'm going to look at the delay
between the light turning on on the
makey makey and the click registering on
that icon so here we go oh that's trippy
hey you can see the you can see the DLP
color wheel so the basic methodology for
this is I go frame by frame to the video
clip there we go
and I look for the frame where the light
on the makey makey illuminates then keep
skipping one two three four okay there
it is now it's highlighted alright so
looking at our results it looks like our
wireless hdmi adapter adds about 30
milliseconds of latency to our input
chain not too bad is it perfect no but
we're also not going to be playing you
know competitive level csgo on here as
well so I am pretty pleased and I'm
going ahead full steam with the plan to
run wireless hdmi and mount the
projector on the ceiling but let's
suppose for a second you did not want to
game with controllers well good news for
you because I have three sets yes
friends three complete sets a phoenix
collection gaming peripherals so their
their whole stick is like yeah we got
like really kind of premium feels to the
products here so check this out
right here is the Aria headset and the
stick on this guy is that the acoustic
chamber is made entirely of Japanese
pine wood I don't personally know that
Japanese pine wood necessarily sounds
better but it certainly looks great so
something like that's got 50 millimeter
drivers it's got memory foam and protein
leather ear cushions and the cushions
are definitely definitely nice feeling
right there it's got a detachable cord
the instructions for which are inside
the box but there's more than that yes
each of these three lucky winners will
also win a Necedah
8200 dpi laser mouse one of those
puppies right there a d'amour a mousepad
which I'm going to have to open because
I did not do that before this thing here
yeah there we go yes friends it looks a
little something like that and finally a
Natur keyboard so this is featuring
Cherry MX brown switches my personal
favorite as well as silk-screened key
caps it's a full 104 key layout just a
little something like that so you're
probably wondering to yourself well hold
on a second line is how do I enter this
compelling giveaway well you'll find the
full instructions for how to do it
linked in the video description there's
