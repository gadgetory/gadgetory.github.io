our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys at the sony booth they've got
what looks to me like a fairly
compelling demo here so I've heard the
argument that you can't really tell the
difference between 1080p and 4k and
while at a very sort of far away
distance that much may be true and while
these may be a little bit exaggerated
because their 86 inch televisions which
I think most people aren't running bear
in mind guys you can already get a 55
inch TV for around that thousand dollar
price points so this could be sooner
than you think so check this out you may
have to zoom in in order to make the
point from the cameras perspective we've
got slick operating the camera of course
so look all right so the 4k TV is on our
left from a distance of I guess I must
be about 2 meters away I can comfortably
read text in something like a newspaper
article however on the 1080p version the
text has a lot of interpolation so it's
very very difficult to read so if the
point that we're trying to make is that
it's sharper especially for a static
image then point taken Sony it's hard to
say how much of a difference you'll be
able to tell in a full motion video
especially because as 4k content gets
more popular we might not see well as 4k
equipment is much more expensive than
1080p equipment we're going to have
limitations in terms of the frame rates
we can capture at so sports we're
probably looking at 1080p for the
foreseeable future however first thing
for anything shot like you know
cityscapes and you know beautiful nature
stuff animals 4k should make an impact
