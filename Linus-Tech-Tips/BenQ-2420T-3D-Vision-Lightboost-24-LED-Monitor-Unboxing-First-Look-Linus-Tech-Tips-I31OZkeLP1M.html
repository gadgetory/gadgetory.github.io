for a while it's possible you already
know that the BenQ 2410 tea was actually
my favorite first generation 3d monitor
that is by first generation I don't mean
first generation because the first
generation was that you saw at one of
that Samsung one both of which for 22
inches which is not big enough and not
high-res enough for a proper gaming
experience these days but my first
generation I mean that went with the
Nvidia 3d vision v1 glasses now I am
very excited in that case
today to have a look at the been cute
24:20 t so this is the successor to the
24 10 t and what it does is it brings a
couple of wow it's really light a couple
of interesting new features into the mix
and the biggest one of those is of
course light boost so it is fully
compatible with Nvidia's light boost
technology which basically modulates the
backlight of the LCD oh okay with it on
top side town you can clearly see all
the accessories here were piled in such
a way as they would be easily taken out
so why don't we go one by one what it
does is it modulates the backlight in
order to create better separation
between the left and the right image and
also to reduce the amount of eye fatigue
and finally last but not least to boost
the amount of light and that makes it to
your eye it worked quite well on the
asus 27-inch that i tried so far but i
am very very excited to see this one so
what the heck is this BenQ gaming is in
the details it's a dust cover that is
certainly a detail I've never seen a
dust cover included with a monitor
before okay we've got the base station
right here so that goes in there
fairly solid looking pieces so far we've
got ah this is cool so this is called
the s switch so the S which is for
navigating between a few different
profiles so what you can do is you can
throw a couple of different profiles on
the monitor with respect to you know
your brightness or contrast however you
want to have it set up and then you can
use that switch instead of navigating
through the clumsy on-screen menus you
can use this switch to quickly switch
between your different profiles so if
you have a certain profile that's good
for one kind of game but not as good for
another kind you can switch to it like
that
and then you can store up to three
profiles another thing that's kind of
cool about it as well is the fact that
you can download professional gamer
profiles I shouldn't say professional
gamers they are professional gamers so
heat on and spawn in particular have
profile you can download you can use
their exact settings and yeah we've got
some distractions here so let me get
these all kind of unwrapped and I'll get
the monitor assembled a lot of a closer
look at it
so before I mount the monitor onto the
stand I just want to have a quick look
at what we've got included in terms of
inputs so we've got a very wide variety
including DisplayPort VGA DVI you're
going to want to use this one for 3d
predominantly although I guess
DisplayPort might also would also work
for 120 Hertz to HDMI is a USB for the
built-in hub and then a USB port that
you could plug something into and this
guy is for that s which which was the
thing for there's your power for quickly
changing profiles so we're going to go
ahead and mount this on here I also want
to talk about some of the other unique
features of this monitor before we
actually fire it up because I'm really
excited to test this one out so some of
the other unique features are they're
all new black equalizers so BenQ has
added some image processing to this
monitor that you know how a lot of the
time whenever you have a shadow in a
game you're almost tempted to turn
shadows off because anything with any
kind of shade that the shadows aren't
soft enough so you lose all of the
detail in there so BenQ has according to
what they're saying made it so that
shadows are going to lose less of the
details but black will still be black
because a lot of the time the
way to combat that is by turning Gama
way up which means you lose a lot of the
color fidelity so you're either losing
image fidelity or you're losing color
fidelity one way or the other this is
also an interesting one so M display
mode 17-inch 19 inch 19 inch wide 21.5
and 20 22 wide and 23 wide I don't
understand the point so guys please post
in the comments if you understand why
you would want to quickly be able to
virtualize a smaller monitor than the
one that you actually purchased um
please let me know why you would want to
do that it includes smart scaling for
fine-tuning these different picture
sizes I mean the one scenario I can
think of where it might make sense is
something like Starcraft 1 where there's
only one resolution that it really looks
good at and otherwise it's going to look
stupid so you might want to quickly
scale your monitor to be a 19-inch for
example you know to play Starcraft 1 but
that's the only scenario I can think of
let me know if you can think of
something else
in terms of included accessories and
peripherals we've got a DVI cable a VGA
cable a USB cable for the built-in hub
you've got a power connector and then
let's go ahead and get this hooked up
here so let's have a look at the overall
aesthetic of the monitor before we get
into the performance there's some pretty
cool things for example the on-screen
display is probably the smartest and
easiest to navigate one that I've yet
encountered you just use these touch
buttons here you go n T it gives you a
little context dependent menu so that's
back you might want to go picture mo oh
alright we need to do that yes oh I'm in
3d so it's not letting me know okay it's
not like we navigate right now but it's
very intuitive see how depending on the
context the functionality of the buttons
changes I'll touch sensitive and very
easy to use you can also however use
this guy right here to scroll between
things and that makes life once again
even a little bit easier so we're going
to just exit out of that
so industrial design I mean Ben Q on the
2410 I thought they did a great job on
this one they've done pretty much
the same job nice thin bezel very thin
monitor remember guys this is LED
backlit so actually I'm fairly sure it's
LED backlit hold on
yeah it's LED backlit so that means that
you've got a better power consumption in
addition to actually surprisingly good
backlight bleed
check this out comes with a headphone
whoops a headphone hanger on the back so
you can hang up a headphones behind your
monitor if you're not using them um yeah
there's no oh look there is their swivel
there's height adjust there's tilt and
you don't have any pivots so it's got
pretty much your basic functionality now
I want to talk about the monitor itself
so it does use a matte screen which many
of you do find preferable personally I
find that to be very preferable and in
terms of the 3d performance it is
outstanding so you see how bright areas
like this look that part of that is
because of light boost technology so as
soon as I look through a monitor if you
look through the but yeah so if you look
through the glasses you'll see more like
the brightness that I'm seeing which is
significantly brighter then actually you
know what I bet you can also see if you
look through the glasses so that's
significantly buy it brighter than 3d
vision v1 I actually want you here let's
get a little bit closer and let's look
at our character here so I want you guys
to look for any separation or or I want
you to look for any ghosting of the
right image you're looking through the
left eye right now and I'm willing to
bet you can find almost none and I call
it ghosting but that's more colloquial
what I really mean is crosstalk or
crossover so what light boost has done
in addition to dramatically increasing
the brightness is it has given
significantly less noise between one
image the image you're supposed to be
seeing and the image that you do see or
rather the images because that's how
it's been a lot of the time in the past
for me anyway um so in something like
trying to which is absolutely beautiful
in 3d I can play for an extended period
eight of time on 3d vision - I know
because I've done it in the past
however with 3d vision one I get a
headache after about 15 minutes it used
to be on 3d vision one eye would do just
fine with a DLP projector but as soon as
I went over to an LCD because of the the
stereo crosstalk seeing the left image
in my right eye and vice-versa
I just wasn't able to really use it past
a little while like it's cool and it's
fun it's great but it would give me a
headache after a while so remember guys
light boost is compatible with 3d vision
v1 glasses looks exactly the same
through the V actually I should
double-check that see if it looks
exactly same yeah looks exactly the same
through the v1 glasses as it does
through the v2 s the benefit of the v2
glasses is that they do have the bigger
frames so you are less likely to see
sort of you know black cutoff instead of
just the screen that you're looking at
although personally I don't find the V
ones that that bothersome I've never
actually got demoed them side by side
like this before so I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
out my overview of the BenQ 2420 so far
out of the light boost compatible 3d
vision - ready monitors that I've tried
it is I'd say a worthy competitor I
don't think I can necessarily declare it
to be the winner because unlike the 2410
which was obviously better than its
competition which had things like glossy
screens sort of critical design design
you know errors in judgment in my
opinion the the asus 27 ish that i've
tried already is very good as well
so right now without trying them side by
side I'd say it's about it for all
intents and purposes equal both of them
provide an excellent gaming experience
with very little stereo crosstalk so
it's going to come down to whether you
want a 24 inch R 27 inch between those
two right now
like all 3d bready 120 Hertz monitors
you do have less overall color depth
available to you because there is less
processing going on with the image so
what that means is that okay I'm not
gonna be able to get back to the Windows
desktop it means you're going to have
less rich colors overall this is a
byproduct of trying to make such a fast
panel with such quickly
bitching pixels so you have to decide do
you want the lightning fast gaming
performance do you want 120 Hertz
remember 120 Hertz is a benefit whether
you're running 3d or not because you do
have a smoother overall experience or do
you prefer rich colors in which case
you're going to want to go with an IPS
or a VA or a pls type panel so thank you
