delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more now the last time I reviewed a
hybrid air / water-cooled graphics card
was back in 2007 when I was doing some
guest writing for Hardware conducci√≥n
under the pseudonym misoprostol and I
reviewed the coolermaster Hydra 8800
since then both I and the concept of
developing a heatsink that also works
well as a water block have grown up
quite a bit with asus leading the charge
in a big way with several of their
recent rog series motherboards featuring
hybrid cool designs that allow the end
user to choose whether they want air
cooling or water cooling now the first
reaction to a hybrid design that you can
use either way from a purist perspective
is well then it probably sucks it both
and in many cases that's probably right
but let's take a closer look at Asus
Poseidon GTX 780 before we finish
judging it Hey
alright so it comes clocked at a blog
standard one thousand six megahertz
boost clock with a Bond standard three
gigs of ram and support for all the
usual Nvidia technologies including
g-sync cuda sli physics game stream
geforce experience with shadow play and
future DirectX 12 support but like many
non-reference cards the differentiation
point of this guy right here is in the
attention to detail given to it by the
board maker the card features a 10 phase
power design with a Seuss's premium
digi+ vrm and better componentry
including their super alloy power phases
which promise longer life time cooler
operation better overclocking and no
coil wine on the front we find a couple
of 90 millimeter fans with a Seuss's
dust proof design that keeps dust out of
the bearings for a longer lifespan other
than the slightly more aggressive rog
themed shroud though there's really not
much to indicate here that this is a
thinly disguised wolf under the cheeps
clothing on to i/o we've got two DVI
ports an HDMI port in a display port
port allowing up to three monitors in
Nvidia
around with an additional auxiliary
display and the SLI connectors at the
top support two three and four Way SLI
configurations at the bottom of the card
the PCIe connector is a 16 X Gen 3
connector but it's not until we get
around to the back here that things
start to get interesting that brushed
aluminum backplate marginally improves
cooling but more importantly looks
absolutely beast and the illuminated ROG
logo on the top won't hurt matters
either then what's this BAM just got
real industry standard G 1/4 barbed
sockets looks like a soos has learned a
thing or two from their years of
integrating water cooling on
motherboards standards are there for a
reason they improve compatibility and
even allow us to put sexy red right
angle fittings from bits power on this
beast finishing up on the outside of the
card we've got an inverted 6 pin and
eight pin power connector
I hope they start doing this on all of
their cards it actually makes me wonder
why I accepted the terrible ergonomics
of the standard connectors pressing the
clip with my thumb is much easier than
pressing it with my index finger flipped
around the other way that's really cool
idea alright so now let's talk about
what's under the hood of what a soos
calls a direct Cu h2o cooler it's vapor
chamber and water channel design is in
my mind the most innovative thing about
this card and where the performance
you're going to see later really comes
from a vapor chamber is basically a
pancake shaped heat pipe that spreads
heat out across its surface they're
expensive to begin with and one with an
embedded water Channel and it must have
cost a fortune to design and implement
but it's a great solution to the problem
that coolermaster had all those years
ago how do you get water close to the
heat being given off by the GPU core
without seriously hurting the
performance of your air cooling solution
for the customers who aren't using water
yet cool master just put a water channel
next to a heat pipe but that's not a lot
of contact area for heat exchange and
this is a much more elegant solution is
it perfect
no it'll be more restrictive than a
normal full cover block but it gives the
user the flexibility to go air now and
water later without spending a bunch and
still real
lysing a big part of the performance
boost that you can get by switching to
liquid cooling to help the vapor chamber
isus put three additional heat pipes
between it and the more distant parts of
the aluminum finish this helps carry
some heat out to the second fan which
with some help from the large diecast
uni sink that's sitting on the top of
the card here cools the vrm area as well
as helping out with the GPU now I hate
to do this to you guys but before I hand
off to Luke I have a sponsor message for
you one that you might actually be very
interested in this right here my friends
is the libera ultimate from Tesoro it's
a fully mechanical keyboard using
whichever flavor of Cale switches you
prefer with almost the entire keyboard
being programmable with remap keys or
macros some handy thumb macro buttons
below the spacebar media keys a built-in
USB hub an audio pass-through and
onboard memory will support for up to
five profiles but watch this shiz
because it's about to get crazy up in
here hold on a second hold on a second
whoa whoa die just blow your mind
because this mechanical keyboard also
has individual key RGB backlighting that
can vary in brightness pulse and I mean
who cares what else it does it's a
solidly built RGB backlit mechanical
keyboard only the second one I have ever
laid eyes on in the first one you can
actually buy with full RGB backlighting
look at me changing profiles I'm all up
in my profile changing biz I can dance
all day I can sell to anyone check out
the link in the video description to
check out pricing and maybe pick one up
I recommend using the 6 key rollover
mode for optimal compatibility and the
included extra USB plug to get up to two
and a half amps of power to your USB hub
for faster phone charging and better
operation with whatever power-hungry
peripherals you might be using alright
so the weights over over to Luke for
some sexy and provocative graphics card
results alright guys welcome to the
performance review of our 780 Poseidon
this card as you know is both air and
water cool capable so when you're
looking at the dock remember to look at
both the air and water cooled rows for
this card as the core clock speeds are
definitely
different in terms of platform we had to
change things up a little bit as we're
water cooling this card so we wanted it
to be on the same bench as all the other
cards that we're testing so in terms of
CPU we're running a 3770k and in terms
of RAM we're running eight gigs of ram
as 1600 megahertz and then as you know
the GPU is very and you can see all of
their clock speeds again in the
overclocking dock linked below this
video in terms of tips for overclocking
there isn't a ton to say this wasn't a
super complicated card to overclock
although one thing that stood out a lot
was how much GPU boost can skew things
the second you put this card on water
it's immediately a lot better and you
can play with it a little bit more as
you'll have more Headroom thermally even
if you have your thermal cap set at 95
degrees and you're not getting anywhere
close to there my load temperatures for
this card under air were about 77 and
then with a thermal cap of 95 and then
when I went to water load went down to
about 45 but then I had a lot more
headroom to play with which is kind of
funky GPU boost can do that so just
remember that if you're overclocking
this card in terms of performance it did
really well it's a higher binned card
than a reference card you'll see so it's
just usually automatically better and
then also underwater it gains more
performance there one thing that's
really nice about this card is the
versatility of both because I was able
to take this error kulit benchmark it
like that strap two tubes to it test it
underwater it worked perfectly fine and
then go right back to air and there was
no real issues one thing to note if
you're going to do that is to drain the
card before you go back to air as you
don't want any pressure problems with
that water heating up in the closed
system once those plugs are screwed on
either way guys that's about it thank
you for watching this video on the 780
platinum if you want to see all of our
Linus tech tips video be sure to
subscribe right here on youtube and
comment below if you have anything
interesting to say about this air water
hybrid cooling set up like dislike
favorite share all that fancy stuff and
if you want to go to the forum to
comment because there's usually a better
discussion going on there
and you don't like the ads that are on
the forum be sure to contribute and then
that's about it thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
