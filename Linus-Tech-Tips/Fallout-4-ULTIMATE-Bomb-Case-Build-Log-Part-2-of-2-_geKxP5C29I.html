a stencil for the nuclear logo didn't go
very well
I used this version and then I have some
adhesive-backed stencil paper but as you
can see tracing things is not exactly a
Forte for me most of these were done on
a table so I could barely see actually
through to the actual logo I need some
form of backlight to help me so I
thought of grabbing the ultime ker
turning it on so the white light is
shining through it and putting it down
on the table but another thing that was
brought up is that I should be tracing
it this way
Brandon pointed out that it's a lot
easier because of the grid lines and
it's a lot easier because it's a paper
if I'm going to be cutting everything
anyways it doesn't really matter so here
we go
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click now to learn more
I love how of all the things that I've
either never done before in this build
or I'm extremely unexperienced in
creating a stencil was the biggest
roadblock alright so that was the first
one done honestly it actually kinda
looks okay so I need to create three
more of those and then four more that
are actually just a circle and don't
have the nuclear details on the inside
this is gonna be a bunch of stenciling
so I'll catch up with you guys in sec
they really just taped the crap out of
it okay so I have my four nuclear 300
wears one of them anyways I'll find it I
have my four nuclear logos now I need to
cut the shapes and things out of the
nuclear logos using an exacto knife in a
cardboard box we're getting close how's
that I got to cut out three more that
took forever so
all right so all my tape markers are on
the 3d printed bomb spacer thingy all
the stencils are cut so now it's time to
take the adhesive part of my stencil off
and stick it on the bomb that doesn't
look right that's three inches up what
the oh yeah one good thing is the
adhesive doesn't seem too strong and try
to place it down and hopefully it won't
be too hard to get off
logo number two it's with one thingy
facing up I now need to take off my
placement stickers the placement of
these things admittedly is not perfect
okay so now it's time to paint the
nuclear logos so I wet the brush and I'm
gonna dip it in a little bit
that's basically what I know to do so
wish me luck dude if this is kind of
supposed to look a little weathered so
you know what if there's imperfections
maybe they were on purpose okay okay
YouTube comments we should rename this
video make it not even about fallout 4
anymore and just call it Luke is really
bad at arts and crafts hopefully I can
even that out a little bit on further
coats but for now we just need to let it
dry next in line in the Train of
nerve-wracking things that we have to do
is cut the bomb because we need I Oh
holes we need to cut holes for power
audio HDMI and an HDMI coupler also we
don't have to cut a hole for Ethernet
there was an option to just screw in an
AC Wi-Fi dongle thing so I'm going to do
that and then leave it inside the case
so before I start cutting I actually
kind of need to figure out how big the
things are that I need to cut the holes
for so for audio pass-through like this
just used an elastic band and I'm gonna
use crazy glue to glue them both
together so the hole can be for both of
them for USBs I'm going to stick them
all together like this and then glue all
of these together so I can have one big
bank of USB pass throughs that I cut one
hole for wow these went really fast
already like rock hard how's that look
okay that was a little close with the
superglue and the USBs and it drying
really quickly around the elastic band
but I think we're good so I just need to
let these things dry okay so we're doing
the second coat of paint now so we'll
see how it goes this time so I went
outside of the stencil slightly right
here oh my goodness you can stay see it
how do I fix that I don't know all right
so the next hurdle is making sure that
everything on the inside doesn't fly all
over the place whenever you try to move
it at all and my idea for this was
terrible so I called my dad who's
generally better these things than I am
and he came up with a way better idea
which was using ready rod to run
supports through the bomb bolting them
on the outside and then also using
readyready rod to support the power
supply in the top so we're gonna do that
but that's way too high up in how far
could this motherboard go down because
we could basically bring the bolt system
down farther and then you got room like
maybe even raise it up a little bit more
than that okay I got my marks so now we
just have to project these straight down
okay
there's rod number one these might even
be too wide they are will need just
because something I like we could
plastic or even just like a zap step
alright so we've changed our minds a
little bit instead of actually going
through the holes on the motherboard we
are going to just suspend the
motherboard from the rods using zap
straps all the ready rod holes are now
done we're going to have it poked out a
little bit past the nut on the end and
we're gonna chop the end of the ready
rod off on this so both sides look for
saying yeah dad had the idea of using
some actual piece of something to make
the platform instead of just zap straps
we're going to use the meshed part so it
actually breathes a little bit better
and I'm just going to Dremel the crap of
it we have made our power supply
platform so it fits right into the top
like so and I'll probably hot glue that
in place or whatever and then power
supply just goes plop right on top of it
so with sound effects wit yeah Bob
specifically that's where that's the
sound that the vast 5 makes you put it
down ok so the super glue and rubber
brand thick rubber brand okay so the
super glue and rubber band thing
actually did seem to work so now it's
time to actually cut so the first thing
I'm gonna put in is our audio okay so I
just drilled my pilot hole so I know on
this side
I want the headphone stuff to go so what
I'm going to do now is drill a bigger
hole with a slightly bigger drill bit
then just file it boom okay this is an
exciting moment our first bit of i/o is
coming out of the bottom of the bomb
that is our audio so I'm going to hop
through this bad boy in then we're going
to move on the next one I'm going to cut
us for the HDMI coupler that's a little
overhang with some bolt holes in it so
I'm going to just cut a circle push it
in from the outside bolt through the
bolt holes and then it'll be secured
that way Brandon just pointed out that
it kind of looks like a surprised face
oh my goodness if you're drilling a hole
like this use this kind of drill bit
save you a lot of trouble
I just forgot perfect
look how snug that is oh my goodness so
if I can find screws that fit and nuts
it fit on those screws I would like to
bolt it in but honestly doesn't even
need it
USB is next in the row so a new USB now
and I'll just deal with the extra wires
Dremel Ang's pretty much gonna be my
best bet because it's a long rectangular
space another like impressively close
fit I'm going to pull it in a little bit
and then hot glue it and we'll be good
to go I can't get this stuff off me geez
I got hot glue stuck on my finger okay
so I'm just picking the positioning for
the power a boat there should be okay
okay so we have our hole of where we
want it to go
okay boom
there is our power cable need to bolt
that in then we're good to go all right
so all the i/o is done I didn't have the
feet on while I was actually drilling
these this top one to the USB 3 works
just fine the second one in it's going
to interfere with this leg pretty quick
then the second bottom one kind of
closed if you have some large USBs so
when you're doing this again get it away
from this leg somehow is a good idea ok
so the final coat of paint has been
applied I just have to take it off now
this is a little bit nerve-wracking
because it looks kind of like absolute
junk right now so hopefully it doesn't
after we pull all this tape off so
there's a little bit of spillover but
that's probably my fault somehow
not a very artsy person so I'll take the
blame there all right so most of the
things we have to do are done now I just
need to cable manage because if I don't
cable manage well enough for at all the
computer components will literally just
not fit ok so I need to make spacers I
thought why not some cardboard I'm going
to tape them on to the card here and
here I don't know if this is gonna work
but I gotta give it a shot so here we go
okay so our custom ghetto cardboard
spacers are done they're taped on and
I'm gonna try to fit this guy I actually
think that's gonna work one more problem
that I have is actually this guy jut out
of metal at the end which could touch
the end of the motherboard so I'm gonna
have to do something with that ok so I
grabbed some like shelf material stuff I
don't even know what this is but it's
not conductive I still have no idea I'm
just gonna naturally even have this on
there but as you can probably already
guess the air flow in this system is
going to be horrible so we're going to
have to address that and we will do that
by testing it first with no additional
airflow measures and then we'll try to
add a few things here there and see what
we can do to improve it now I know I
said that we are going to be hanging the
motherboard off the support bars with
zap straps but it like doesn't move at
all so I'm gonna zap strap it anyways
but realistically there's no point
all right so moment of truth we're gonna
turn it on oh I'm really nervous um
oh hey oh okay
whoa the computer works okay the
computer works oh I was really worried
about that for so many different reasons
but all right I need to figure out
thermals real quick so running i-264 on
the cpu within like a couple seconds we
had a CPU throttle of about 30% so yep
one thing I'm going to try to do is try
to fit an industrial PPC naktu in there
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
make it fit I might have to do a smaller
fan but this would be nice that does
seem to be helping the cooling although
I really don't think that's going to
fully solve the problem whoa Oh yup
there it is see if you throttling now
one thing that I'm actually going to try
to do is maybe just turn off turbo turbo
mode disabled so what we're going to do
is try to jump into our Crysis 3 skybox
test if it's able to pass that then it's
probably fine
well I've never had a complete computer
red screen before that's a first no idea
with that but it's not good
11:1 I broke everything is what this
one's called okay so last night Linus
sauce moving around on the motion sensor
things and kicked us out told us to go
to bed I came in this morning I had
missed my alarm picked up the bomb
didn't realize that there was something
over top of the legs and two of the
supports on the legs this one and this
one actually completely broke off so I
super glued them and and then when I
went to go put the bomb down immediately
after breaking it there was something
holding on to the switch cable and it
ripped the red wire completely out so I
stripped both ends of that soldered that
back together this is working again
at that point I was pretty pissed off
and I was like I just want this freakin
thing to work I reek able managed a
whole bunch of stuff and then I dremeled
and cut out two pretty massive holes
actually on the bottom and then grabbed
some really low profile 60 millimeter
fans from some stock AMD coolers that we
had and I'm going to mount those in the
bottom as air intakes so those should
help quite a bit and with in between the
clips up here cut out this should
actually be air flow this time so let's
try finishing the build a second time
hopefully I don't massively break
anything else and yeah let's go I have
noticed that there is actually some
extra room here so I might actually try
to upgrade the CPU cooler the
silverstone aro 6 is in I was a bit of a
tight fit on the back had some problems
there but it's fine
also the RAM didn't fit is nicely as I'd
hoped so this second inner stick of
Corsair lpx got a little bit of a unique
treatment the caps for the heat pipes on
the cooler were a little bit too big and
pressed against it and made it Lee
into the other stick so I took a dremel
to it and kind of cut some grooves where
madness looks horrible
where the heat pipes would actually be
trying to go so now you can put it in it
actually it's just fine
so once lino sees that I might not have
a job so hopefully you guys like this
video a lot the 300 watt is no longer
needed this thing served me well for the
time I had it
but the 450 watt has finally showed up
got it got it got it which is good
because last night when we were testing
we did actually run into some power
issues so very happy to see that got a
new cooler on the motherboard time to
start trying to put things back together
it's unlikely that it will melt a lot of
computers are plastic - hot damn alright
so inside you can see we've got some
space in front of the CPU for it to
breathe we've got our two sticks of RAM
like we were talking about this Y cable
for the fans goes to the two fans that
are in the bottom this winde eSATA cable
kind of tries to keep itself out of the
way and then plugs into the SSD which is
back here we have our anti shock mat
thing which is going to try to keep the
back of the motherboard protected from
things shorting it out we have our Nano
which is held away from the motherboard
a little bit by our custom cardboard
spacers and our blue painters tape our
Wi-Fi card is actually keeping the SSD
away from the back of the graphics card
because the SSD is closed in metal and I
don't want it too short the graphics
card and all together it fits all under
the top crossbar which is the ready
ready rod or whatever so that we can put
the plate on top of there and we can put
our new 450 watt power supply on top of
that plug it into here plug in the
graphics card plug in the motherboard 24
pin and eight pay
and then plug in the SSD and then we're
going to see if it runs okay so there's
one thing left that could ruin
everything the top of the bomb gets this
ring on it and then this cap goes on top
of that ring but on the inside part of
the idea that we have for air to be able
to escape at the top is for these
sections between the clips to be cut out
if I miss I could take out one of the
clips and then it might not actually go
in here and then they're just going to
be a hole in the top of our bomb which
will look super dumb what a random note
I haven't shaved since we started this
because I've literally been working on
this or sleeping I showered I haven't
shaved all right so the top is on it's
clipped in there we left a little bit
extra on each side so I could click it
in and then we taped it on so that it
shouldn't rotate and then fall in so
that those air gaps should actually stay
there now I'm a little bit worried
because there's some weight to it and
those legs are maybe not as strong as
they used to be in their young days so
it's kind of go time I want to make sure
this thing works ok so the legs go in
its plugin time
okay so fans installed on the bottom new
CPU cooler the CPU was thermal
throttling within seconds before now
we've been running i-264 for a little
bit we're floating between 6070 degrees
depending on what core you're counting I
think we might have done it
tunnel there the easy to use privacy app
for mobile and desktop internet browsing
you can use tunnel bear on iOS Android
Mac PC or even a direct Chrome extension
that lets you tunnel or browse the
Internet as if you're in up to 14
different countries with ease this
allows you to access things like geo
blocked websites which can be very
frustrating to deal with it's super easy
to install and use and if you encounter
any issues have friendly support bear
standing by 24 hours a day to help they
currently serve over five million users
and you can join them by becoming a free

that's not enough for you they have
unlimited plan starting at $6.99 or
better yet head over to tunnel bear comm
slash LTT and you can save 10% all right
that is it
it works the computer runs I've already
ran Crysis 3 on it everything's fine
it's not thermal throttling it's got
some good stuff going on it's been it's
been a while I've been working on this
thing since Monday at 9:30 a.m. till
about midnight every single day and now
we're finally here it's 7:00 something
on a Thursday I don't even know what
happened to this week hopefully you guys
liked the video give it a like if you
did honestly that will help because if
everyone appreciates this I can maybe do
this for other game launches or say
movie launches like Star Wars in
December anyways
that's about it like I said like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
didn't but like come on man
down like rude
