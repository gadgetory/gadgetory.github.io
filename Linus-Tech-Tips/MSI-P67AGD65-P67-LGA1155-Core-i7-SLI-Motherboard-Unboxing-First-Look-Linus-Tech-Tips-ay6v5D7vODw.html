ip67 a GD 65 so this is an LGA 1155
motherboard which means it is compatible
with LGA 1155 intel core series
processors this is a next generation
platform compared to the last gen 1156
despite the change in socket number
which actually goes down by one pin so
let's have a look at what msi has
presented with presented us with for
their p67 a series of board so first of
all we have military class 2 so
basically this is an improvement on the
military class concept that msi has been
doing for a couple of board generations
now high stability components such as
being able to deliver up to thirty
percent more power being able to last up
to 10 years so that's the kind of
component choices that they're making
for the capacitors as well as for the
chokes the entire power delivery system
of their military class series
components is designed to operate
silently and to deliver clean power to
your parts it comes with a three-year
warranty in US Canada and Mexico unlike
the last generation once we've got four
USB 3.0 ports and force a 26 gigabit per
second port so on the p55 Intel boards
we used to see two and two of each of
those okay we have one second
overclocking so msi has improved their
OC genie it is now version 2 so that's
their one-button overclocking procedure
can't really call it a procedure if it's
one button can you just push the button
it's very simple ok we have full support
for nvidia sli technology ati crossfirex
which i guess is now AMD crossfirex its
windows 7 ready and then you've also got
that Intel stuff which we talked about
already let's have a look at what they
have to say for themselves on the back
of the board we've got a bit of a
reiteration of military class too so
eight times lifespan for these guys
thirty percent higher current for these
chokes and 10 plus years so they're
saying 12 years of life time under full
load gaming or up to 40 years in an
office environment so there you go so
basically by the time
this motherboard dies you probably won't
care is I think what they're trying to
say we've also got a couple other
features here instant OC so that's their
control center software we've got
supercharger so you can charge your iPad
iPhone at high speed even when your PC
is shut down that's a pretty neat
feature click BIOS times too so applies
the unified oh yeah efi BIOS I haven't
even talked about that yet so MSI's p67
boards feature an efi bios which means
that you have support for like a mouse
in the bios it's pretty much a change
that i wish we'd had years ago but bios
technology has made a huge leap with
this generation of boards from msi we
just have to end Winky three so that's
their quick boot into a bare-bones OS so
you can browse the internet and do a
couple rudimentary things with your
board without actually doing into
windows so the motherboard is the first
thing we find once we open up the
packaging but I'm just teasing you with
that we're actually going to look at the
accessories first all right we have a
multi-gpu sli video link card so i guess
what they mean is sli bridge we have a
couple say 26 gigabit per second cables
we have a straight one in a right angle
okay next we have tape set what is this
mmm this is exciting okay once I get it
out of the package i'll be able to to
show you guys why it's exciting finally
we have USB 3.0 hatter or we have a USB
3.0 header implemented write on the
board rather than having like a goofy
internal USB 3 slot that then you run a
cable to and then like run that out the
back of your case so this is a header
which will hopefully support front USB
in the future but for now they're giving
you a pci bracket with full support for
USB 3.0 superspeed so two on the back
panel two off of a header so glad to see
that two more SATA cables one straight
one right angle those are the same as
the other ones I guess and then we have
a molex to SATA power adapter just in
case you don't have enough SATA power
connectors on your board so here's the
msim connect
therefore easily installing your front
panel switches and whatnot here's an i/o
shield which is labeled if you have a
drivers and utilities disk which you
should throw away and download the
latest we have movie check nice so this
board includes be checkpoint so you can
use your multimeter to actually manually
check down to a much better accuracy
than any BIOS readings going to give you
what voltage you're feeding to your
components here's a quick installation
guide here is a software application
user guide so they show you how to use
the MSI software that you might need to
use like control center and last but not
least the full user's guide and this is
the european version this is a sample
bored so i'm assuming you'll get at
north american version was your board if
you live in north america which not all
of my viewers do so that was yeah okay
not sure where I was going with that
guys here we go so this is it this is
the p67 a GD 65 I'm just going to peel
off these stickers one sec overclocking
with OC Genie military class 2 we've
covered all of that so far so let's have
a look at the overall layout of this
board take off all the plastic and
everything really love the look of this
board it's got like just the right
amount of shininess so I there this is
actually quite reflective will do the
finger test so you can see how
reflective that is ok really like that I
actually like glossy finishes on things
so let's start with the CPU socket so
here is your standard LGA 1155 socket ok
you've got a lever arm so the CPU
mounting is done in exactly the same way
as LGA 1156 up in the top left corner
exactly where it belongs you've got your
8-pin CPU power connector here are your
MOSFETs so this is your military class
MOSFETs they are cooled by one heat pipe
between two separate little heat sinks
ok we have a pwm cpu fan connector we
have support for up to i believe it goes
up to 32 gigs although please correct me
in the comments if i'm wrong but i
believe we do have support for up to
eight gig dims although I
can't imagine why you would need 32 gigs
at this time but anyway so for slot
supporting dual channel memory cameraman
is like getting away from from me here
up here on the top right hopefully you
can make his way back up here in the top
right we have our V checkpoint so you
can leave got two grounds pc hvcc cpu
cpu vtt and VCC p we've got a couple
more fans here here is our 24 pin power
connector right where it belongs on the
right-hand edge of the board and then
moving down here is our storage so we
have four SATA ports two of them are sr
rather four of them we have four banks
okay so two of the banks that is four
ports our state a six gigabit per second
and the other two the black ones are
going to be sated to that is three
gigabit per second okay next we have our
front panel connectors we have our OC
Genie button we have built-in switches
for reset and power those are very handy
if you're testing on an open bench like
I often do we have USB we have a camera
man wants to get a better look at those
ok we have us be moving over then we
have firewire here's our USB 3 header so
happy to see that finally integrated on
a board now let's have a look at our
pcie slot layout we have three pci e 1x
slots two pcie 16x slots and two pci
slot so i want to explain to two slots
as you are going to operate in dual 8x
mode whereas a single slot will operate
in pc at you 16x mode so this is just
like p55 now bear in mind there is no
measurable performance penalty for
running in dual 16x mode we've also got
two PCI slots so that's for any legacy
devices you might have that do use pci
and i really like the slot layout
because it does give you support even if
you're using two dual slot cards for up
to an additional 12 pcie 1x and one pci
card so if that oh yeah so cameraman is
checking out the chipset cooler you can
see there's not a whole lot to it
there's actually not a whole lot to the
piece
67 chipset almost everything is on the
cpu now including the memory controller
and even the PCIe Lane controller so
here on the back we find a number of
things we find one two three four five
six seven eight that's a big number USB
2.0 ports we find two USB 3.0 ports so
that's a total of ten USB ports on the
back panel we have eSATA dually SATA
support then we also have one of those
combo ps2 ports that I'm so fond up so
you can use either a keyboard or a mouse
in it we have a clear CMOS which digital
audio out is supported in both flavors
that is optical or coaxial we have
firewire support just in case you
actually own a firewire device and we
have gigabit ethernet we also have
support for 7.1 analog audio and I think
that's pretty much everything I have to
say about the p67 a GD 65 thank you for
checking out my unboxing and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips a
couple of points to clarify about the
p67 a GD 65 so it does have dual BIOS
physical BIOS chips so that means you'd
have to work things up pretty badly in
order to corrupt both of those so it
should be just fine whether you're
flashing your buyers are doing whatever
else and I wanted to also clarify what
OC Genie to does so on a eight p67 board
it still only does CPU overclocking but
on an h 67 board it also integrates GPU
boost so you can overclock the
integrated graphics core on your new
core processor another thing I also
wanted to mention those that OC Genie
because of some of the limitations of
the p67 platform is only supported on
k-series unlocked processors so please
guys bear that in mind if you're
planning to use OC genie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
