p67
a GD 65 so this is an LGA 1155
motherboard which means it is compatible
with LGA 1155 Intel Core Series
processors this is a next-generation
platform compared to the last gen 1156
despite the change in socket number
which actually goes down by one pin so
let's have a look at what MSI has
presented with presented us with four
there P 67 a series of boards so first
of all we have military class 2 so
basically this is an improvement on the
military class concept that MSI has been
doing for a couple of board generations
now high stability components such as
being able to deliver up to 30% more
power being able to last up to 10 years
so that's the kind of component choices
that they're making for the capacitors
as well as for the chokes the entire
power delivery system of their military
class series components is designed to
operate silently and to deliver clean
power to your parts it comes with a
three-year warranty in US Canada and
Mexico unlike the last generation once
we've got 4 USB 3.0 ports and 4 SATA 6
gigabits per second port so on the p55
intel boards we used to see 2 and 2 of
each of those ok we have one second
overclocking so MSI has improved their
OC Genie it is now version 2 so that's
their one button overclocking procedure
can't really call it a procedure if it's
one button can you just push the button
it's very simple okay we have full
support for nvidia sli technology ATI
crossfire which I guess is now AMD frost
fire it's Windows 7 ready and then
you've also got that Intel stuff which
we talked about already let's have a
look at what they have to say for
themselves on the back of the board
we've got a bit of a reiteration of
military class 2 so 8 times lifespan for
these guys 30% higher current for these
chokes and 10 plus years so they're
saying 12 years of lifetime under full
load gaming or up to 40 years in an
office environment so there you go
so basically by the time
this motherboard dies you probably won't
care I think what they're trying to say
we've also got a couple other features
here the instant OC so that's their
control center software we've got super
charger so you can charge your iPad and
iPhone at high speed even when your PC
is shut down that's a pretty neat
feature click BIOS x 2.so applies the
unified oh yeah efi bios i haven't even
talked about that yet so MSI's p67
boards feature an EFI bios which means
that you have support for like a mouse
in the bios it's pretty much a change
that I wish we'd had years ago but BIOS
technology has made a huge leap with
this generation of boards from MSI we
just set there and wink t3 so that's
their quick boot into a bare-bones OS so
you can browse the internet and do a
couple rudimentary things with your
board without actually doing into
Windows
so the motherboard is the first thing we
find once we open up the packaging but
I'm just teasing you with that we're
actually gonna look at the accessories
first alright we have a multi GPU sli
video link card so I guess what they
mean is sli bridge we have a couple SATA
6 gigabits per second cables we have a
straight one in a right angle okay next
we have tape set what is this mmm
this is exciting okay once I get it out
of the package I'll be able to to show
you guys why it's exciting
finally we have USB 3.0 header or we
have a USB 3.0 header implemented right
on the board rather than having like a
goofy internal USB 3 slot that then you
run a cable to and then like run that
out the back of your case so this is a
header which will hopefully support
front USB in the future but for now
they're giving you a PCI bracket with
full support for USB 3.0 SuperSpeed so
two on the back panel two off of a
header so glad to do that two more SATA
cables one straight one right angle
those are the same as the other ones I
guess and then we have a molex to SATA
power adapter just in case you don't
have enough SATA power connectors on
your board so here's the MSI M connector
for easily installing your front panel
switches
what not there's an i/o shield which is
labeled so you have a drivers and
utilities disc which you should throw
away and download the latest we have ooh
we check nice so this board includes V
checkpoint so you can use your
multimeter to actually manually check
down to a much better accuracy than any
BIOS readings going to give you what
voltage you're feeding to your
components here is a quick installation
guide here is a software application
user guide so they show you how to use
the MSI software that you might need to
use like control center and last but not
least the full users guide and this is
the European version this is a sample
board so I'm assuming you'll get a North
American version with your board if you
live in North America which not all of
my viewers do so yeah okay not sure
where I was going with that guys here we
go so this is it this is the p67 a GD 65
I'm just gonna peel off these stickers
one sec overclocking with OC Genie
military fast - you've covered all of
that so far so let's have a look at the
overall layout of this board take off
all the plastic and everything really
love the look of this board it's got
like just the right amount of shininess
so I there this is actually quite
reflective we'll do the finger test so
you can see how reflective that is okay
really like that I actually like glossy
finishes on things so let's start with
the CPU socket so here's your standard
LGA 1155 socket okay you've got a lever
arm so the cpu mounting is done in
exactly the same way as LGA 1156 up in
the top left corner exactly where it
belongs you've got your 8 pin CPU power
connector here are your MOSFETs so this
is your military class MOSFETs they are
cooled by one heat pipe between two
separate little heat sinks okay we have
a PWM cpu fan connector we have support
for up to I believe it goes up to 32
gigs although please correct me in the
comments if I'm wrong but I believe we
do have support for up to 8 gig dims
although I really can't imagine
why you would need 32 gigs at this time
but anyway so four slots supporting dual
channel memory camera man's like getting
away from from me here up here on the
top right hopefully he can make his way
back up here in the top right we have
our V checkpoint so you can chat leave
about two grounds
PCH VCC CPU CPU VT t and VCC P we've got
a couple more fans here here is our 24
pin power connector right where it
belongs on the right-hand edge of the
board and then moving down here is our
storage so we have four SATA ports two
of them are s are rather four of them we
have four banks okay so two of the banks
that is four ports are state a six
gigabit per second and the other two the
black ones are going to be SATA 2 that
is three gigabit per second okay next we
have our front panel connectors we have
our OC Genie button we have built in
switches for reset and power those are
very handy if you're testing on an open
bench like I often do we have a USB we
have a camera man wants to get a better
look at those okay we have us be moving
over then we have firewire here's our
USB 3 header so happy to see that
finally integrated on a board now let's
have a look at our PCIe slot layout we
have three PCIe 1x slots two PCIe 16x
slots and two PCI slots so I want to
explain so two slots that are going to
operate in dual eight X mode whereas a
single slot will operate in PCIe 16x
mode so this is just like p55 now bear
in mind there is no measurable
performance penalty for running in dual
16x mode we've also got two PCI slots so
that's for any legacy devices you might
have that do use PCI and I really like
this slot layout because it does give
you support even if you're using two
dual slot cards for up to an additional
one two PCIe 1x and one PCI card so Eve
that oh yeah so cameraman is checking
out the chipset cooler you can see
there's not a whole lot to it there's
actually not a whole lot to the p67
chipset
almost everything is on the CPU now
including the memory controller and even
the PCIe Lane controller so here on the
back we find a number of things we find
one two three four five six seven eight
that's a big number USB 2.0 ports we
find two USB 3.0 ports that's a total of
ten USB ports on the back panel we have
eSATA dual eSATA support then we also
have one of those combo ps2 ports that
I'm so fond of so you can use either a
keyboard or a mouse in it we have a
clear CMOS switch digital audio out is
supported in both flavors that is
optical or coaxial we have firewire
support just in case you actually own a
FireWire device and we have Gigabit
Ethernet we also have support for 7.1
analog audio and I think that's pretty
much everything I have to say about the
p67
a GD 65 thank you for checking out my
unboxing and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips a couple of points to
clarify about the P 67 a GD 65 so it
does have dual BIOS physical BIOS chips
so that means you'd have to work things
up pretty badly in order to corrupt both
of those so it should be just fine the
whether you're flashing your BIOS or
doing whatever else and I wanted to also
clarify what OC Genie 2 does so on a 8 P
67 board it still only does CPU
overclocking but on an h-60 7 board it
also integrates GPU boost so you can
overclock the integrated graphics core
on your new core processor another thing
I also wanted to mention though is that
OC Genie because of some of the
limitations of the P 67 platform is only
supported on K series unlocked
processors so please guys bear that in
mind if you're planning to use OC genie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
