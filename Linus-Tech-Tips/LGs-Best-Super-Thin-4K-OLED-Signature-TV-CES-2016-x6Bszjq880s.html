here in an LG suite actually prior to
the opening of the main show to have a
sneak peek at some of the stuff that
they'll be showing off on the show floor
so to my left we've got their new super
UHD TVs which is UHD so 3840 by 2160
resolution but now with super so there's
actually three lines within their LCD
lineup of super UHD TVs and you get a
variety of different features better
contrast things like high dynamic range
depending on which tier you spring for
but this is the real star of the show so
it's part of LG's new Signature Series
concept which is supposed to be the best
of what they can do in terms of design
as well as performance and while some of
the other products in the Signature
Series are stuff that we don't generally
cover like washing machines this is
definitely right up our alley so this is
the g6 series of OLED TVs and it builds
on the previous generation flagship o
LEDs from LG in a number of key ways so
number one is that while you can't
improve on perfect black that is to say
the pixel being effectively off whenever
there's black displayed on the screen
you can improve the maximum brightness
so it's still effectively infinite
contrast but this allows it to achieve
what LG is calling HDR pro so it's a
level of high dynamic range image
quality that you can't achieve unless
you've made the tweaks that they've made
to the pixels in the last year they've
actually dramatically improved the color
reproduction of them as well making
these TVs capable of 99% of the DCI
cinema color space much like those LG
monitors that we use to produce our
videos back at the studio which is all
fine and good that covers the
performance part of the Signature Series
but I haven't talked anything about the
design and it shouldn't come as any
surprise that LG's come back this year
with bigger and yes my friends the
big trend thinner so this puppy right
here is actually an astonishing 2.7
millimeters thick across pretty much the
entirety of the back of the display okay
yes there is a little bump in the back
for some structural support as well as
to attach to the base which cleverly by
the way integrates a Harman Kardon
collaborated 4.2 80 watt sound bar but
the actual electronics have been moved
outside of the TV something that I've
been I've been saying someone's gonna do
this eventually they're gonna have to
build a thinner TV and they're gonna go
okay well we've run out of room for HDMI
ports even let's just take it completely
outside of the box and they have
effectively done it not only that but
the OLED panel is now mounted on a
gorgeous piece of glass giving it a very
premium look and feel not to say that
I'm recommending that you go and touch
your TV all the time it's just that the
image looks so unbelievable even here in
the suite which is not necessarily ideal
viewing conditions that you might
actually be tempted to so thanks for
checking out our coverage of the LG
suite here just kind of in advance of
the rest of the show at CES 2016 I want
to take this time to give a huge shout
out to Squarespace for allowing us to be
