unboxing this is going to be four
gigabytes highest-end P 67 series board
this is the P 67 AUD seven we have full
support for Intel's latest core i3 i5
and i7 processors on the LGA 1155
platform although if you're putting an
i3 on this thing shame on you
so the first thing we're gonna find out
about this board is that it has a three
year warranty okay and it delivers
maximum CPU power so why don't we go
ahead and open up the front of the box
and find out what exactly gigabyte means
by that well they have equipped this
motherboard with a 24 phase power design
because on the p67 platform most of the
overclocking intrigue has been removed
from the motherboard side because we're
pretty much just overclocking using the
CPU multiplier the most important thing
the motherboard manufacturers can do for
you these days is provide a stable
platform with lots of features and great
power delivery because that's how you're
gonna get the most out of your chip
they've also designed their chipset
cooling design to be cooled well by a
downdraft CPU cooler so something like a
Noctua NH C 14 would be a great choice
for a board like this let's go ahead
over here and have a look at what else
gigabyte has to say for themselves on
this board here's the 24 phase power ya
delivers maximum CPU power we get it
you've got overclocking performance
which they're saying is more higher is
better okay and then they're saying
they've also got a longer lifetime
because they have their ultra durable
three technology + and dual power
switching okay thanks guys next we have
their three three three onboard
acceleration which means you have
support for SATA three six gigabit per
second you've got USB power 3x which
means that you can run up to three times
the number of peripherals off one USB
3.0 port using a hub and then you've
also got 3x a USB 3.0 which is up to 10
times the speed of USB 2.0 support for
3-way SLI and I'm sorry
and 3-way crossfire which is a bit
unique for our p67 board because most of
them are only going to have support for
two-way SLI and two-way crossfire and
that's pretty much it oh yeah also their
on/off charge features so you can charge
your iPhone or iPad or whatever other
device even when this PC is powered off
so they've got nice black internals are
in internals interior here on all of the
packaging let's see what gigabyte has
included with this board ok first we
have a warning socket 1155 is not socket
1156 so please please make sure if
you're buying a piece IXY 7 board like
this one you are not trying to install a
socket 1156 processor in it here we've
got our user's manual as well as a six
series drivers and utilities DVD which
you should throw away and download the
latest from the gigabyte website
multilingual installation guide books
showing you how to install your CPU Ram
all that good stuff next we have a
couple of stickers a gigabyte one and a
Dolby home theater one finally we have
an i/o shield so that'll go on the back
of the board handily color-coded for
your convenience next we have two no
four SATA cables two right angle and two
straight we have a 3-way SLI bridge a
two-way SLI bridge remember that if you
need crossfire bridges those will be
included with your graphics card we have
one of their awesome back panel eSATA
PCI guides
so you plug that into two of your
internal ports you get more eSATA then
you can use that adapter to plug in a
couple standalone Drive and you've got
some eSATA cable this is a great little
kit big fan gigabytes been including
that with their boards for a little
while so this is appropriately bright
yellow okay so let's go ahead and close
that up we're done with that let's have
a look at the board itself this is it
the p67 8u d7 now unlike some of their
last generation ud7 boards gigabyte has
not opted for a non-standard
size to this board this is a stash
ATX board although other than that
there's nothing really very standard
about it this is an exceptional looking
board and out of all of the p67 boards
I've seen so far I think it features the
best color scheme which yes I'm shallow
whatever guys deal with it I love the
color scheme I was pretty tired of
seeing the traditional hair I happen to
have one handy the traditional gigabyte
baby blue and you know white and blue
and yeah I mean it looks alright but
show me something it matches that's the
challenge right so let's start with the
the overall layout of the board here
we've got our LGA 1155 socket right here
in the middle surrounded by 24 phases of
CPU power delivery we have our 8 pin
connector up here in the top left of the
board exactly where it belongs we've got
a pretty innovative looking cooling
design going on here on the MOSFETs as
well as on the chipsets so you can see
there's heat pipes connecting these two
heat pipes connecting this guy and this
guy and then I can't tell if it's one
heat pipe going all the way through but
there's also a heat pipe running between
the Northbridge and the MOSFETs up here
in terms of RAM support we have up to
four dims in dual channel mode so that
is two banks of dual channel memory
supported by this particular board this
is ddr3 memory just like the last
generation p55 so if you are upgrading
you can reuse your old p55 compatible
memory moving down this right hand edge
of the board we've got a couple useful
things first we have an onboard power
switch love these and I love the
location of this I'm actually pretty
tired of seeing them down here on the
down on the bottom edge of the board
because when you have a bunch of
graphics cards installed you can't reach
that anymore so this is great next we
have a clear CMOS switch also
conveniently located right here and last
but not least we have a reset switch
right here the reset switch you don't
use as much so I can definitely forgive
them for using a cheaper switch than the
power one there we have our 24 pin
connector and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge of the board and
then next we have our let's see what are
these
okay here we go so these ports are sort
of color-coded these two are SATA to
three gigabit per second
these ones are SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second and these ones are running off of
the third-party chipset say 2 3 6
gigabit per second so SATA 2 SATA 3 this
one's running off the intel chipset this
one is not we have an LED post reader
and apparently there's a clear seamless
somewhere around here although I don't
actually see it so maybe you guys can
sort of point out where that is for me
here's all of your front panel
connectors here's your USB there is your
front USB 3.0 apparently wow you've got
look at that you've got 2 front USB 3.0
many chipsets did they put on this thing
okay well that's outstanding so you have
two front panel headers for USB 3.0
that's great
right now there aren't really any cases
that support that standard yet but
hopefully by the time you watch this
video there will be if you're watching
it a lot later here is firewire which if
you're honestly still using then good
for you I guess someone has to and then
let's have a look at our slot layout
we've got a single PCIe 1x slot we've
got three PCIe 16x slots which are all
actually only wired up to PCIe 8 X and
then we have an open bread sorry okay
these two are wired for full 16x
operational though I don't know what
they actually run at and then this one
is wired only for 8 X and this one is
wired only for 8 X so if you are running
3-way crossfire or 3-way SLI don't kid
yourself you're not going to be running
at 16 X 16 X 16 X but it hasn't really
been demonstrated that it impacts
performance negatively anyhow
alright we have 2 legacy PCI slots in
what I'd say is pretty much an ideal
location because it looks like the way
it's set up these are going to be your
16 X 1 and 16 X 2 slot so you would
cover these these ones if you're running
to dual slot graphics cards it doesn't
leave as much spacing as I normally like
to see but it does leave you a pretty
good expansion options you have one 8 X
slot left as well as one PCI slot and
one 1 X PCIe slot for any expand
cards that you require let's move around
to the back of the board and have a look
at is one of the more impressive IO
shields that I've ever seen so we've got
our ps2 combo port which I'm still a big
fan of love these things they're great
we have six yes count them six USB 3.0
SuperSpeed ports we have digital audio
in both optical and coaxial flavors we
have dual eSATA two USB 2.0 ports and
two firewire ports dual Gigabit LAN as
well as 7.1 audio out so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the p67 a UD
seven don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from we're unboxing the
reviews and other videos about computers
and stuff so I just want to give you
guys a brief explanation of how the PCIe
slots work on this board there is an NF
200 chip which is basically splitting
the to 8 X slots into either okay there
so bear with me here it's either taking
the 16x bandwidth and splitting it into
16 X 16 X or it's taking that 16 X
bandwidth and splitting it into 8 X 8 X
8 X + 8 X so you still do have good
bandwidth to all four slots even if
they're all populated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
