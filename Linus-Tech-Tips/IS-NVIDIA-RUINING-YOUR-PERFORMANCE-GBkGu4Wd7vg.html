from Nvidia prompts a huge spike in
forum posts and angry tweet saying
Nvidia ruined my FPS in game X with
driver y YY dot VZ and and planned
obsolescence but is there really any
rhyme or reason to these claims or is it
just a bunch of crap we tested it and
we're going to tell you after these
messages
browse privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app starts
your seven day free trial at the link in
the video description now before we
really get into this I want to clarify
that I've been a longtime skeptic when
it comes to nvidia and AMD conspiracy
theories they are almost always
half-baked fanboy purchase decision
reinforcing rants and frankly they make
my brain hurt seriously Jake tried a lot
of different search terms all the way
from Nvidia driver Hertz performance to
Nvidia broken how please and not even
one post contained concrete evidence of
a legitimate decrease in performance
over time I mean don't get me wrong
there were a lot of posts about the 375
point eight six drivers memory clock
issue but no one has gathered sufficient
or really any evidence showing that
nvidia has purposely harmed performance
of older cards to force their users to
upgrade through a driver update so I
decided to painstakingly assign Jake the
task of testing it ourselves first we
needed to pick some games we wanted a
mix of ones that use only standard
features of the DirectX API and at least
one example that uses Nvidia's
proprietary game works then to ensure we
weren't missing out on a particular
architecture that got neat
because it was like too good compared to
the new thing they needed to sell we
grabbed a flagship from every generation
from GTX 680 all the way to 1080 ti with
games and card selected the next
challenge was drivers we can't test all
of them so we eventually settled on the
drivers one release after the launch of
each card that we used and the most
recent one available at this time so the
idea then was that this would show us a
clear progression over time is Nvidia
improving ignoring or outright harming
the performance of older cards once the
new generation comes out so driver by
driver card by card Jake ran almost 200
rounds of benchmarks collecting 3 metric
asked tons of data then he sat down to
organize it into some charts and the
results are astonishingly boring the
most recent release seems to be a bit of
a turd across the board so there's that
but in general not only did performance
not decrease there were small but
noticeable increases over time in almost
every case due to the miniscule nature
of these improvements it's hard to see
where they actually start an end so
we're not much closer to a clear picture
of nvidia x' internal policy with
respect to product software support but
it does at least tell us that nvidia has
never rolled out a sandbag edition
driver which doesn't mean they've never
rolled out a bad driver 375 point
eight-six hurt performance and sli
issues seem to come and go like shadow
from final fantasy 6 so what is going on
then where are people getting these
ideas we think the perception mostly
stems from this when a new game launches
older GPUs don't get the whole
optimization treatment the way that the
current ones would that means that you
might run into situations where all
their cards with more
raw power might be beat by newer ones
with less text boss showcased this in
their articles on project cars and
battlefield 1 performance which are
linked down in the video description
where you can see a GTX 970
outperforming a 780ti and there's
another major factor the tech not all
graphic solutions are the same the goal
with every new generation is to tailor
it for the features of the game engines
that are in wide use or are right on the
horizon examples would be Nvidia
specific features like hair works or
general rendering techniques like HP ao+
ambient occlusion older silicon doesn't
handle either of these things as well
because they either didn't exist when it
was being designed or NVIDIA guess it
wouldn't be widely implemented the work
of designing a GPU
starts years before you'll be able to
buy one I mean if you were in the PC
scene a few years back you might
remember this happening with
tessellation Nvidia cards were and still
seem to be much faster at rendering
tessellated meshes to such a degree that
AMD had to add AMD optimized
tessellation to their drivers basically
removing a bunch of it and when Crytek
controversially put an overkill amount
of tessellation in Crysis 2 it
completely tanked the ability of
similarly performing AMD cards compared
to their NVIDIA counterparts so in this
case your older Hardware literally
wasn't made for the questionable
decisions of game devs in newer games
so in conclusion then from our testing
Nvidia does not appear to be slowing
down older cards to encourage upgrades
the better performance from newer cards
probably has more to do with their
engineers not just sitting on ass all
day I mean look at it from their
perspective if they don't optimize this
from generation to generation Jensen
will yell at them what does seem like
it's happening is that newer game
features
aren't getting as much optimization for
older cards but I also think it's a
little unreasonable to get too mad at
Nvidia for this they support cards as
far back as the 8000 series on Windows
10 and while they might not perform
clock for clock the same as they used to
they simply weren't built for modern
rendering technologies so if you want
bleeding-edge performance you need to be
on the bleeding edge in terms of
hardware whether or not that's worth
weeding your wallet dry that one's up to
