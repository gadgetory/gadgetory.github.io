livestream of building a very special
machine one for me so it's finally here
in a massive wooden crate and naturally
the first thing I'll be doing is tearing
it apart welcome to another
unbuild blog here on - tech tips if I
could only get this on the table
okay so I don't know who came up with
origins premium shipping containers but
this thing is amazing it actually feels
like the stuff inside is worth $4,000
which is this case is probably because
it is quite a high-end config so you
start by removing all the screws from
the top of the wooden crate you can do
this by hand but I would strongly
recommend that you whip out an electric
drill if you're not looking to beef up
those forearms then the side comes off
you slide the cardboard box out of the
wooden crate remove these plastics lock
things and lift the whole top of the box
up to reveal the accessory carton with
some good stuff like extra power supply
cables or magnetic Wi-Fi antennas and
whoo an RGB lighting controller and some
less useful stuff like CDs and a DVI to
VGA adapter as well as the most glorious
soft cell foam I have ever laid my hands
on I mean I know I'm going on and on
about the packaging at this point but it
just keeps getting better the case is
shrouded in this cloth scratch cover and
when you lift that off BAM more badass
foam this bag stuff works by mixing a
couple of expanding chemicals when you
break the internal separator kind of
like a glow stick then what it does is
it expands to fill in all the nooks and
crannies making it much safer to ship
systems with graphics cards
pre-installed I remember looking into
these back when I worked for a system
integrator we've got a couple of samples
and then decided against it due to the
ching-ching that they were going to cost
us now I've seen origins millennium case
at shows but I've never really been
hands-on with it it is surprisingly well
thought out mine is a mid tower
configuration without the modular bottom
piece for more drives or cooling and
with a beautiful red accent paint job
that goes perfectly with the component
choices inside I let them pick the
hardware since they're the ones ponying
up for the system here so I removed this
back cover this is here because the
motherboard can go in for
or different ways or something like that
so the IO might not always end up going
to the rear and fired up the system
there's that RGB lighting it's got the
same basic controls as you'd expect so
whatever color you want on the inside
sort of front top side accent pieces and
the front logo but with a twist there's
a button on the case but you can push to
control a completely separate UV LED
strip I don't have any UV reactive parts
in this machine but it's a nice touch
for those who do with the system fired
up I checked out the pre-installed
programs actually nothing too bad in
here and then I ran some stress tests to
ensure that system temperatures and
performance were as expected one cool
note is that while I took my readings
from i-264 in software the CPU temp can
also be read from a little display
directly on the motherboard cool the
video cards brought about the first
challenge in my unbuild even I fix it
couldn't save me from these skinny holes
to reach the GPU screws so I needed my
old jeweler screwdrivers and a pair of
pliers to extract them and actually no
not quite I also needed some side
cutters since the PCI Express power
connectors were cleverly cable managed
to the fan power for the video card so
they would not move at all speaking of
the video card though these are MSI
gaming series gtx 980ti s
normally I prefer rear exhaust cards but
this case has ample airflow between the
rear top and bottom fans for the extra
heat that gets blown around inside the
case and these types of coolers do do a
better job of keeping the card itself
cool and you can see that in the results
from cooling even though it was 32
degrees outside on the day that I was
doing this testing the CPU cooler is a
custom job II from ASA tech you can tell
from the design of the hold down with
origins branding on the block and the
long quarter-inch tubes go over to the
front where they're connected to the
radiator before we look at that though
we'll pull out the CPU the core i7 6700
K is pretty much the perfect choice for
us
of this class as long as you don't
intend to add more graphics cards or a
ton more PCI Express expansion cards
keeping it cool is a massive triple 120
millimeter radiator something I had
wished for from the major AIO makers for
ages with three origin branded fans
running through a clever little cable
management grommet to a fan splitter on
a custom PCB near the front of the
chassis hiding behind the five and a
quarter inch bays it should be noted
that this is one of the few things on
this case that is not symmetrical for
power it doesn't get much more overkill
than a 1300 watt EVGA g2 and while the
supernova blows up everything and takes
everything else with it branding of EVGA
power supplies doesn't make a ton of
sense to me
I can't argue with the quality or in
this case the cable management I don't
know why more case makers like people
who just make cases not origin who has
their case designed and put systems in
it I don't know why more case makers
don't build their products like this
there are so many cable management
points they cost nothing extra to
manufacture and make life so much easier
for the Builder who wants to do a
professional job of cable management
behind the motherboard tray origins
motherboard choice is a little more
overkill than I would normally opt for
for a personal system but I can't fault
the features of the z170a gaming m9 ACK
it's got the onboard sound isolated from
the rest of the PCB dual MDOT two slots
for up to 2 m2 SSDs
it's got a ton of i/o including USB
type-c dual front USB 3 headers for the
forefront ports on this case it's got
ample cooling and a flashy thank
goodness I don't have to install
anything but the bare driver killer
networking solution for Ram it appears
at first that they've gone with
plain-jane dual channel HyperX fury ddr4
but wait oh what's that
I want HyperX RAM with my name on it
that is freaking awesome which I guess
leads us to mass storage I really liked
the hot-swap system for this case one of
the weird things is that only three of
the bays are plugged in out of the
factory so you might have to guess and
check a little to find out which ones
have SATA connections there's no reason
that they shouldn't have been able to
run a couple more cables and do them all
but overall the one terabyte Seagate
drive that ships in the system should be
well protected and well cooled by this
aluminum five bay hot swap cage with
expansion being a piece of cake our
optical drive is well you guessed it
it's an optical drive woohoo it's one of
those things that used to have sex
appeal actually and now is about as
interesting to enthusiasts as a USB
powered Jack O'Lantern probably less
there are a few things that I want to
take a closer look at here on the case
it took me a while but I finally figured
out the front logo illumination and how
that happens without any power leads
going to it there's an LED that comes
out of that custom PCB that they have in
the in the front top of the case but
handles the IR receiver for the RGB
lighting as well as all the front i/o
and front buttons and all of that good
stuff
I also figured out how they mount the
motherboard in the different
configurations so you just take these
rails unscrew them and there are just a
ton of holes in this baby so depending
on what orientation you want to mount it
in let's say we wanted to reverse ATX
you just move them around to where they
go and you slide the motherboard tray in
the other way you put some screws back
in and there you have it while I was
doing that though I discovered that one
of the RGB lighting strips was in the
way of trying to orient the motherboard
the other way and it turns out this is
really cool origen actually did up their
own RGB lighting strips that actually
like got their name right on the back of
the PCBs so these use a hard PCB rather
than a flexible one and then they are
hard mounted with standoffs and
ruse to the case rather than relying on
adhesive as you guys probably know if
you've ever used LED strips that
adhesive can come off pretty easily
especially over time that's an over
engineered solution to the problem of
LED strips falling off and shipping but
I really really like it so there you
have it guys my unbilled treatment of
origin pcs masterpiece is complete i
have reduced it to its bare components
and if you guys were thinking well gee
linus that is a crying shame because I'd
love to have an Origin PC we've actually
got a link in the video description
including an offer code it's Linus OPC
and get yourself free CPU and GPU
overclocking from those guys but if you
liked the video and you're not looking
to buy a computer necessarily all you
got to do is click the like button get
subscribed for more videos just like
this one and hey maybe if you really
liked it you can support us by buying a
cool shirt like this one well actually
not quite like this one
this one's all fully and shiny it's a
new design that's hopefully going to be
coming soon by our community forum where
you can ask questions and answer
questions and maybe even become a
contributor over there you get a cool
little contributor badge or just by
checking out our other channels we've
got some great videos up on channel
super fun lately you can click the
little I in the corner if you want to
check out the one that we've got
featured right here and I think that's
it that's all I will see you guys again
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
