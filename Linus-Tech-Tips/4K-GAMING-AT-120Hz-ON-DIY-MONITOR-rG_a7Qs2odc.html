occasionally a little late to the party
for example uploading videos about a new
Apple product days after the initial
coverage wave has come and gone you know
it is what it is
we try whatever get off my back but not
today know what I'm showing you guys
today is not stale at all in fact I
don't think I'd even describe it as ripe
yet I mean look it doesn't even have
room in the box for the power adapter
it's just it's just separate this is the
first look at the full 4k 120 kit but
what's that and where did it come from
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app starts
your seven day free trial at the link in
the video description ok so first things
first I gotta say I'm a little unnerved
by this box because there is no friggin
way that a monitor and a stand for a
monitor are fitting in here and like
look at this we got like a handwritten
note here
take care made by hand and then we've
got the name of the guy
Aziz who made it so this is zis from
these works cool boy Wow what the heck
this thing is just like a completely
naked talent
oh my gosh this is like exposed PCBs on
the back there's no stand no plastic
housing sewage credit okay to its credit
it does have a vase amount here but no
way okay there's only three there's only
three mounting points here there we go I
got it and I know this is I think I
found the nut okay so we've got it
mounted now we just used this random
monitor arm that we found and look at
this weird stuff we got going on here so
this right here is a JTAG programmer for
updating the firmware of and debugging
the main chip and this like taped on
doodad here is actually a USB to serial
adapter for debugging everything else
the monitor comes with a heap of
technical documentation to help you do
all of these things and you can even
reprogram the LED backlight driver if
that tickles your pickle okay so it's
probably clear to most of you by now
that the
and this thing is here in our shop is
clearly nothing to do with how polished
and finished it is as a product it's
because it's the first monitor to reach
our lab that runs at 3840 by 2160 4k at
a hundred and twenty Hertz that's right
you gamers can have your cake and eat it
too with high resolution and high
refresh rate but how did a small fish
like Aziz
pull this off before the big dogs like a
Susan a sir who showed off their high
refresh rate displays at CES this year a
quick implementation of the display port
1.4 standard and that is a negatory
general check this out we've actually
got two DisplayPort inputs here one
right there and one right there so I
guess let's start by firing it up with
just one connected
there okay so check this out
there's no normal on-screen display but
it does have these completely unlabeled
buttons up here that hold on a minute is
this thing completely held on by one
screw at the top yeah okay so as I was
saying it has these unlabeled buttons
that helpfully come with this
handwritten user guide to tell me what
they're for so there's power oh so oh
sorry no power is labeled so why don't
we start with that one well press it Wow
that turns on really quickly okay so the
next two are for adjusting brightness
okay there's a label there there's a
plus and a minus pretty well here and
then there's other ones for switching
between a bunch of different EDID
profiles for reported resolution and
refresh rate starting with 540 P at 480
Hertz and wow this looks pretty crap I
mean it has like an interlaced look to
it and quite honestly like in motion but
even the TN pixels can't switch fast
enough to avoid having like a purple
trail behind black objects but boy does
that ever feel butter smooth Wow
then the next which is 720p at up to 300
Hertz which is still really darn smooth
and is at least I can tell if it's a CT
or a terrorist at this resolution
compared to 540 P the next one is 1080 P
add up to 240 Hertz and I can see how
this feature would be useful when you
look at how quickly it switches modes if
you're the kind of person who often
finds yourself dialing back the
resolution to get more FPS out of games
like csgo
and then wants to turn up the resolution
for sight-seeing games like Civilization
six or Skyrim I mean these buttons
really do make switching super-easy
or maybe it's dumb let us know in the
comments if you think you would actually
use these or not so okay here we are
1080p 240 Hertz pretty sick but it's not
the native resolution so you're dealing
with interpolation and there are already
monitors that are actually designed to
run at that resolution and that refresh
rate so then let's get finally to good
old-fashioned 4k 60 Hertz and then wah
okay so we weren't expecting 4k 120
Hertz here but we've got a visual
demonstration of the limits of
DisplayPort 1.2 it just can't push that
much data so instead it has to
compromise let's plug in a second
display port cable well that didn't
happen in any of our testing before we
go to film you can see the right side of
the screen is a little bit welco but we
had still had for the first time the
experience of 120 Hertz gaming at 4k
resolution and given that we've got this
game running at about 150 to 200 FPS it
is definitely a thing to behold now is
this the optimal situation with the
whole thing going on with the flickering
on the right hand side of the screen and
all that obviously not but I guess we
all learned a valuable lesson about
shipping display controllers that
literally have unstable pinned onto the
back of them so in summary then aside
from this glitchyness right when we go
to film
this works haha but how do you buy one
the answer is you don't yet and you may
never be looking at a traditional
finished monitor from this works their
special sauce is in the development that
they're doing on custom electronics and
the concept that they want a crowd fund
is the idea of DIY enthusiasts being
able to buy their module and slap it
onto an existing panel whether through a
bundle from these works or off eBay or
whatever there will always be drawbacks
to an approach like this the calibration
and display tuning that goes on with a
finished product was clearly not present
on our in a Lux m2 a TD JJ - L 30 and
you won't get fancy features like g-sync
anytime soon but these work has tested
other options like a 39 inch MVA panel
and they say it works pretty similarly
and they're also expecting costs for DIY
monitor solutions like this to be
hundreds of dollars cheaper than 120
Hertz 4k gaming monitors from
traditional companies so yay or nay DIY
mix and match monitors and electronics
