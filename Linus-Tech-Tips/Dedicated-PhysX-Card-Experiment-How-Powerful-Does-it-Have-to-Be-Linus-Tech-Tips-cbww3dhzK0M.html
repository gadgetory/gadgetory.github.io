a fairly interesting video here on my
test bench today I have two things I
have a GTX 580 from EVGA and I also have
an 8600 GT ass so that's a bit of a
mismatch you think what I will be
looking at today is the performance
impact of a high performance graphics
card versus a low performance graphics
card as a dedicated this X processor so
this GTX 580 is going to be doing all of
my graphics processing regardless and
then I'm going to run two different
scenarios I'm going to run with the 8600
GT s as my dedicated PhysX card and then
I'm going to try running with another
GTX 580 which is obviously ludicrously
overkill as my dedicated PhysX card so
if you guys check out up here I have my
physics configuration set so I have
selected the 8600 GT s as my dedicated
PhysX card and I'm going to try with
both scenarios and I'll let you guys
know how it goes well I've already run
into some interesting results so I'm
running at 1920 by 1080 on mafia 2 I'm
running with high details 8 x AF
anti-aliasing is on and I've already run
only 2 scenarios so I've run the GTX 580
with the 8600 GT s as a dedicated PhysX
card and then I run the GTX 580 ignoring
the 8600 GT s so using itself for
physics you can force that in the driver
as well and it actually scored those are
the GTX 580 actually scored 66% higher
by itself then it did by tying it down
with this 8600 GT s to do the physics
processing so let's see what else we can
investigate here so at this point guys
I've run quite a few more fascinating
scenarios so here you can see my GTX 580
running a gtx 550 ti as a dedicated
physics card but i've actually finished
all of the run throughs that i am going
to do and i just want to share with you
my results so this is also going to be a
sneak peek into what my next episode is
going to be looking at PCIe bandwidth
and the effects on gaming performance
here I have my full results so the GTX
580 alone gets about 50 frames per
second you throw in a physics card
that's too slow and it goes all the way
down to 30fps so what that means to me
is that you're far better off to just
let this card do both the graphics and
the physics by itself then to give it
something that's so slow that it
bottlenecks it and that the physics
calculations are going to be behind the
rate at which this card can draw the
frames okay so that is clearly a problem
okay so then I tried a few cards of
varying power as a dedicated PhysX card
so I tried an additional GTX 580 I tried
a GTX 560 Ti as well as a gtx 550 so I
don't know where the threshold is but it
looks like this is how it works for
physics because these three are all
within margin of error of each other
regardless of how much physics power
we're throwing at it I mean a GTX 580 is
clearly overkill for physics processing
but you can see that the 550 ti and the
560 T are also both just fine so the
answer is I don't know exactly where
that threshold is and it's going to
depend from game to game how much
physics processing is needed but what
you need for physics is a card that is
fast enough not too slow because that
will bottleneck your entire setup and
not so fast that you're spending way too
much money on it so something like a 550
or even something a little bit lower end
or maybe a last generation card that you
can get your hands on on the cheap is
probably the best bet if you have
something like a GTX 580 as your main
card so thanks for checking out this
