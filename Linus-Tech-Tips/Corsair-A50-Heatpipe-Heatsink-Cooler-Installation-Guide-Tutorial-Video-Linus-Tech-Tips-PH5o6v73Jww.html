do CPU heatsink installation tutorial so
I'm going to start with one on the
Corsair a 50 so this is their mainstream
CPU cooler you can see it is a three
thick eight millimeter heat pipe direct
touch tower heatsink that's actually
fairly straight port so we'll start with
the CPU in the socket that is a core i7
8 7 5k unlocked so the first two things
we're going to need are some TP in this
case Charmian very very soft very nice
and we will also need some rubbing
alcohol so go ahead and open that up
rubbing alcohol is going to allow you to
remove the old thermal compound and not
leave behind any nasty residue so go
ahead get some rubbing alcohol in there
and then wipe off the old thermal
compound honestly it doesn't have to be
perfect as long as you do a reasonably
good job what I usually do is all I'll
wipe off as much as I can with the wet
part of the of the toilet paper or paper
towel or whatever I happen to be using
and then I'll go back and grab a fresh
piece and then just wipe off any sort of
random residue that might be left so
that gets our CPU nice and clean and
ready for the next stage so you can see
it's all you can't see that nevermind ok
so the next stage is to put on whatever
brackets are required in order to melt
listen to you so I've never mounted this
cooler before so this is going to be a
bit of a journey of discovery for me
trying to mount a CPU cooler that I've
never done before couldn't be that
complicated I mean Corsair usually does
a pretty bang-up job of this kind of
stuff so I found four screws and I found
a backplate so let's assume the back
plate goes on first and that it is not
adjusted to the correct settings so I'm
moving it one notch in to LGA 1156
because this is a universal backplate
it's compatible with 775 11
56 and 1366 so we're going to go over
here if we have a case with a with a CPU
backplate hole then this is where that
really comes in handy because most
aftermarket coolers anyway the good ones
are gonna require a backplate so that
they mount nice and nice and strong okay
so we gotta kind of adjust these just a
little bit with that on there that's
kind of interesting so I'm gonna flip
over my board so they don't line up
quite the way that I had them adjusted
that's one thing that can be a little
bit finicky about universal anything is
that it tends to be sort of not quite
without some fine adjustments so there
we go
just do I head and make sure that's on
there pretty good you know what I think
one of them is not not in the right
position still there we go
so just people those a bit yeah now you
can see it's a it doesn't have to stay
in place as long as the holes are coming
up and it's not putting any pressure on
the mounting holes of the motherboard so
there we've done that part we have a
back plate success okay oh yeah another
important tip for upgrading your
heatsink is never leave an open bottle
of rubbing alcohol sitting on the table
because at some point you will knock it
off and it will be bad will not be fun
for little rubber grommets I wonder if
those go on the back of the back plate
will have the instructions
hi we'll be back in just a moment okay
well I can't figure it out so let's
assume it does nothing Wow with some
with some cool ears the backplate is a
necessary piece because the the
backplate sorry the the grommets are
necessary piece because the backplate
doesn't have any non conductive coating
but this one does it has a plastic cover
over the backplate so you don't have to
worry about installing it there alright
so here we are now we have this piece
which is going to go through right there
and then we will fix it to the heatsink
with the four included screws there we
are so this is fairly straightforward
basically we're just taking the
hold-down plate and attaching it to the
CPU cooler and that's probably gonna go
in from the bottom based on how
difficult this is I try to do it this
way there we are
yeah you can see those screw holes or
counts or some so that yes you can
install these screws from the bottom and
should because that is how it is
designed to work really have a whole lot
of commentary I already said everything
that I really thought about this
heatsink at the time that I unboxed it
that's the thing about guides is if you
do them in real time like on the camera
as I tend to do all of my videos then
there's a lot of like long pauses okay
so this is the AMD mounting bracket
which we will not need today well why
don't we put on some thermal compound so
we're putting on thermal compound this
is really easy you take your little
syringe and then you go like this you
mean
if they're that's enough that's probably
more than enough I probably put on too
much that's okay
here I'll let you see how much I put on
my camera would focus that would be
great
there we are that is how much I put on
it is probably too much but I mean I
could make the argument that I can put
on a little bit extra because there are
some grooves in between the heat pipes
and the aluminum base of the heatsink so
maybe we need to fill in more gaps
that's my story and I'm sticking to so
I'm going to be installing a ram fan so
one thing that I want to be aware of is
that I need enough room to the side of
the cooler to install my ramp and so
there we are we placed the cooler down
on top of the backplate that's very
straightforward and then we go ahead and
tighten the thumbscrews you always want
to put the thumb screws on before
actually like tightening them down with
a lot of force okay so I've just put
them on they're not actually holding
anything right now that way you can
tighten them all at the same time which
is going to allow you to apply even
pressure to your CPU throughout the
mounting procedure which is going to
reduce the chances of damaging it or
your motherboard so you can see that
these are thumb screws but they do have
Phillips head holes at the top so what
I'll be doing is I'll be tightening them
that tightening them up just a little
bit so finger tight right now all four
if I want it to be really anal retentive
I could go in diagonals like this okay
make sure we're tightening that up real
good and then I'm gonna go ahead and
give them another however much with the
screwdriver so yeah these are this is a
good mounting system it's designed to
only go as far as it needs to go so you
can't just here I'll show you what I
mean in a sec there is no to do so you
see how the threading on the screws
actually are on the backplate actually
ends and the screws only go on as far as
the threading goes so it means you can't
over tighten it which is a really good
feature
so now let's go ahead and take the fan
that's included with the egg 50 and
we're going to orient the clips right
here so that they're on the side where
they clip into the heatsink and we're
going to push it on just like like
something just like that then we're
gonna take our CPU fan and we are going
to either plug it straight into the
motherboard header which is here there's
our CPU motherboard header or we can
plug it into this handy-dandy noise
reduction adapter just basically just a
resistor in line and then we can plug
that in that was it that was the whole
installation procedure for the Corsair
850 thank you for checking it up and
