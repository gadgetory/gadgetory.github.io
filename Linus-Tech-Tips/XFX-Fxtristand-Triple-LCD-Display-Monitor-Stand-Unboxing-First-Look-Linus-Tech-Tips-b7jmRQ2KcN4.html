my family did this one year where you do
Christmas morning and everyone brings an
unlabeled present and puts it under the
tree and it can be anything like God you
know it can be your old bowling trophy
or it can be something you bought at the
store and that's actually kind of cool
and as a kid but the first one I went
for was the biggest possible package and
the reason I mentioned bowling trophy is
because that among with a among a bunch
of other random stupid knickknacks is
what was in my my Secret Santa gift so
this is proof that not every time when
you go for the huge box will it be
something stupid inside this is actually
a product that I am very excited about
because although AMD eyefinity
technology has been on the market for
quite some time there hasn't really been
a good economical feasible way to run
three monitors other than like ghetto
modding it and throwing three monitors
on your desk but there stands running
all the cables everywhere and it just it
doesn't look that good you can buy
expensive stands but that's the problem
they're quite expensive
I mean Samsung had their MD to 3:03
something out remember that that
expensive thing with the three monitors
and the one stand built-in but once
again very very expensive
well XFX decided they were gonna address
that so this is the triple display
monitor stand from XFX that's right
folks a reasonably priced triple monitor
stand from a manufacturer that you trust
XFX
but unboxing before the unboxing
struggling here guys
the struggling alright alright there we
go now we have the real bottom so we can
clearly see what is inside the box so
that's it I won't be unboxing it today
bye yeah I'm kidding on the back let's
see what XFX has to say for themselves
so it's designed to withstand the most
intense gaming sessions and extreme
workdays adjust your monitors
individually or collectively cool up to
24 inches each for height angle and
rotation with the XFX triple display
monitor stand your single base will free
up desk space while integrated cable
management keeps course untangled and
organized and it adds functionality to
the already sleek design with two USB
ports as well as jacks for your gaming
headset cool there's a right in the
front what's included send me adjustable
HD pivot fully adjustable HD adjustable
pivot extrusion crossbar 1.5 inch pole
XFX plastic cap crossbar cable
management clip full management clip m4
phillips pan head monitor mount screws
and allen key another allen key abase an
instruction booklet six three and a half
millimeter stereo cables no a 6-foot
three-and-a-half millimeter stereo cable
and a six foot USB cable so those are
going to be just pass throughs so that
you can plug from the back of your case
into the monitor stand and then from the
front of the monitor stand into your
headset or USB devices inside we find
dyra phone with an XFX logo on it next
we find a manual for both dual and
triple display monitor stands now the
triple one is the one that I'm really
interests
and that's the one that we have here
today so they show us the steps although
this probably looks like a tech tips
episode in its own right here's pretty
much what they want it to look like at
the end so there's you know your webcam
and there's your three monitors with all
of the cables are routed okay and let's
have a look at all the different things
that are included it comes on a lot of
pieces so uh yeah here we go here's a
USB A to B cable so that's for the
integrated hub
here's your three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jacks for your microphone as well
as your headphones very nice touch
alright see XFX is a gaming company so
they put that extra little bit of
thought into things
gamers need a microphone and a headphone
port let's provide it good on you guys
okay here we have some visa compatible
monitor mounting screws three sets of
four all right you have a bag and then
we have what appears to be a cable
management clip of some sort you know
what if I get any of this stuff wrong I
apologize guys because I haven't
assembled one of these yet so I don't
know alright this looks like a little
cap for this tube okay with a logo on it
as well as a little clip on the back
I've got a couple allen keys here this
looks like the main stand you can see
it's threaded on the one end and not
threaded on the other end so that's
probably where that cap goes alright
next we have the arm assembly itself so
check this out guys so it's uh know
exactly how it works it looks like
something to do with
yeah I don't know guys but you can
adjust these so I can play that much
okay and then you can tighten those up
if you want them to be there okay let's
see if I can find anything else
adjustable here this looks like it's for
tightening this in place so you got one
of these nifty little guys right here
that you have on your cheap Jack
included with your car so I had to do
the other day actually I've had a flat
tire on my car and had to take out the
stupid jack from under my spare tire
install my spare tire what a painting
take my car to Costco get some new tires
all right there we go so let's put that
away for now without dropping it and
breaking it because I just don't need it
all right next we have some more little
Clippy bits we have another piece of
styrofoam
wow that's pretty boss looking all right
ah here we have the pieces that make
this other piece that I was tinkering
with before actually makes sense because
these ha I think I get it okay these go
on here like this okay see that ridge
right there
so these hook on there and then well I
already pretty much can't remove it look
at that so it stays on really good so
you put these on here and then you
attach monitors to them they can slide
what appears to be pretty much the
entire length of this bar so you can
mount the monitor wherever you desire so
if you have a few different size
monitors although that wouldn't make any
sense you could potentially do that if
you want it okay gives you a lot of
flexibility if nothing else have another
one of these and another one of these so
this looks like the this looks like the
center one because it's different from
the others and then these two no wait no
this looks like the center one because
it's different from the others and then
these two look like they must be the
outer ones and finally we have the base
itself which has got some weight to it
which is good I was hoping if it had
wait to it because you're gonna put
three up to 24 inch monitors hanging off
of this thing
so you're gonna need not only some
weight to keep it from moving around and
tipping but also some surface area or
some white width to the stance so even
though we're gonna have all this weight
hanging off the front you can see XFX
has designed this to lean quite far
forward so even if you try to try to tip
it it shouldn't go anywhere in the front
here we have our microphone our
headphone jack as well as our two USB
ports which you could use for example
for your keyboard and mouse say for
example if you work I don't know a gamer
okay and then in the back we have the
pass throughs so there's your mic pass
through your headphone pass through and
your USB hub on the bottom we find some
non-stick arm nonstick non-slip pads
okay so these are all over the place
down here you can see there's far more
in the front than there are in the back
in terms of the spacing the reason for
that once again is because most of the
weight is going to be forward leaning on
this particular device and that is
important for stability alright thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
XFX cheerful display monitor stand I
hope to get this thing assembled and
show you guys what it looks like with
three monitors on it in the next little
while here and as always don't forget to
