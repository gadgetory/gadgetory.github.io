installation guide for installing the
GTX 480 full cover water block on the
GTX 480 and I guess it's a bit of a
guide for installing a full cover block
in general should you want to do that
okay so the first thing is you will need
to have all of the necessary things
you'll need a water block a video card
please do this with a high end video
card I've seen people like water cooling
GTX 460 s by the time you spend a
hundred dollars on water lock for that
kind of card you might as well about a
better one next you will need some
thermal compound a Phillips head
screwdriver usually although with the
GTX 580 you'll need a Torx as well and
then you will also need the instructions
please follow these carefully read them
carefully all of that good stuff so the
first thing we're going to do is remove
the stock cooler I haven't quite decided
if I'm gonna do this video in real time
or like how real time I'm gonna make it
I think I'll have to sort of do the
steps and then come back because things
like removing screws from the back of a
video Carter pretty tedious and it's
hard enough to just kind of Yammer on
about random things to fill the empty
parts of my videos at the best of times
but it mean this is just like graphics
card cooler installation there isn't
really much to talk about so yeah bear
with me while I do this up once you've
removed all the screws from the back of
the card make sure you don't forget to
do the ones at the end of the PCI
bracket before you try to remove the
cooler okay so now that the cards apart
what I usually do at this step is take
all of the thermal pads off of the card
put them back exactly where they were on
the stock cooler take all of these
screws put them back into the stock
cooler and then put it in a ziploc bag
or wrap it in plastic wrap or something
so that that's gonna still be there for
you if you ever need to take off the
waterblock and put the stock cooler back
on either for warranty purposes or if
you don't want to water cool that system
anymore or whatever the case may be for
this next step you'll need something
that I forgot to mention you'll need
some 99% isopropyl alcohol
and you will need some TP or I mean
ideally you'd use a lint-free cloth but
I mean who has enough of those to throw
away oh and this is interesting it's
funny his timing is awesome because
here's a protip for you I don't know if
you can see this or not but there's
actually a hair on the GPU from when I
reapplied the thermal compound with the
air cooler
it's a multicolored hair so I'm pretty
sure I know where it came from
cat hey yeah you pretty sure it came
from you
so the next step is you take a little
bit of toilet paper some isopropyl and
you read it and then you remove all
residue all everything you can get off
of the thermal compound on the GPU
as well as any leftovers of the thermal
pads on the memory chips so you use the
wet TP to remove it and then you should
give it another good wipe down with a
clean part you can see that even though
it looked clean there was still quite a
bit of residue on there find another
clean part go again you want to make
sure you're removing everything because
that's gonna give you the best interface
between the new waterblock
and the stuff that you are trying to
cool with it but I usually do after I've
done a good few wipes once the toilet
paper starts coming off pretty clean
like that then I usually give it a wipe
with a lint-free cloth which is normally
whatever shirt I'm wearing because I
care a lot more about my graphics cards
than I do about my clothes and that way
you can be sure that you haven't left
any little remnants of the toilet paper
fibers on the any of the surfaces yet
another thing that I didn't account for
us needing scissors so now we're going
to cut the thermal pads to size so that
we can put them all on the correct parts
of the PCB well not the PCB we're going
to put them on the ground the RM not on
the GPU thermal pads do not go on the
GPU and yeah so I think the only ones we
actually have to cut are the RAM
so you can see e Ches instructions or
like that so they show you you cut for
per so the easiest way to cut for is to
cut half and then to cut half again so
we're going to do that and that and then
we end up with little thermal paths that
are just the right size for a brand chip
so when you're applying these please
please please make sure you remove the
plastic covers from both sides okay
because if you leave those on you will
be probably roasting your ram so good
luck with that so I'm going to go ahead
and apply all the round ones and then
we'll cover the prm's after that these
are kind of finicky this is going to
take me a little while
it's a lot harder to do this when you're
trying to hold a camera at the same time
so there it's applied just like that
it's been a while since I've installed
an ek full cover but it looks like
they've actually really improved the way
they do their instructions so you they
clearly label sort of which pads are
which and which ones go where and what
they're supposed to cover so that sounds
pretty outstanding so I'm going to do
the MOSFET ones now which are on this
one this one and this one which used to
be square but I cut it down a little bit
smaller because a lot it was like coming
up to here at the edge of the card and
the last thing you wanted to have it
installed and be able to see the other
side of the thermal pad just under the
block when you look in the side of your
case I don't know about you guys but you
know I'm a bit of a perfectionist when
it comes to this sort of stuff so that
would be that would be an unacceptable
result to me and I would have to take
the whole thing apart which is a real
pain and I don't feel like doing that so
as with anything water cooling it's way
way better to do it right the first time
than to try to correct it later so there
I put on that one next I'm gonna apply
this one and this one I don't really
care if they stick out the bottom
because I'll never see those actually I
wouldn't see those I'm going to trim
these two so I'm just put them well that
was almost really funny and I haha I
guess it's time to buy a new graphics
card sort of way I made a small mistake
the number three thermal pad is actually
a little bit thicker than the number two
thermal pad and I had misread the
instructions here I thought three was
supposed to go over this square here but
actually you're supposed to cut it up
and put it on these little guys right
here so that is now done and then I used
one of these trips that I figured I was
being innovative and trimmed from the
bottom of these to put up here so now
everything is covered and I'm in good
shape
as always with water cooling and this is
why I didn't make the mistake ultimately
make sure you double check go through do
a sanity check make sure that all of
your bases are covered
alright so next we're gonna put the
reinforcer and we should please note
that the orientation of the reinforcer
is important one of the other key points
when install
a GPU waterblock is making sure you use
the right screws for everything so you
can see these ones are short the ones in
the diagram for putting on the spacer or
rather the reinforcer plate are short
I'm going to use a technique that I call
the innovative edge of the table
technique so this allows me to screw
something into the back of the cart
without upsetting all the thermal pads
that I have placed on the top so I just
kind of get my head under it and it's
great in there now this next parts a
real pain and a total mess if you do it
the way that ek recommends basically
they say take some thermal compound put
it on these little washers and then put
them in place and hopefully that will
help them stay in place and then take
the card and position it over top
personally I okay if I wasn't doing a
guide for you guys and doing things by
the book I would never use the washers
the reason they exist is because certain
people couldn't handle not
over-tightening they're full cover water
blocks and here hold on an Orientalist
this way so that the PCI backplate is
going to hang over the edge of the table
so I can put it down cleanly make sure
that I don't move those washers actually
I better do this off-camera this is
going to be tricky but anyway people
couldn't handle not over tightening
their water blocks so everyone started
implementing standoffs and one is one
way or another and basically if you
don't over tighten it it's not necessary
but since the manufacturer does
recommend it I am recommending that you
go ahead and use them although I
personally am NOT going to cover them in
thermal compound because that's a mess
that I don't feel like cleaning up if I
ever have to remove it thermal compound
application is one of those hotly
debated topics I'll be using icy diamond
thermal compound okay and because this
is such a large heat spreader I will be
using a large amount of compound and I'm
going to go ahead and use the X
technique so when you got a big surface
to cover the grain of rice sometimes
doesn't really
shut it Oh about how thick this stuff is
it's hard to apply through a camera
compared to when you're not trying to
apply through a camera there we go so
then I'm gonna go where I was before and
take the moat
this way come on okay I would recommend
using well part of the problem is the
rooms quite simple you know I'm just
gonna show you against the end result
well that's quite possibly the worst job
of applying thermal paste ever but most
important thing is that we've got really
good coverage in the center and that
it's got somewhere to spread out from so
that the actual dye itself is maybe
cooled so yeah do as I say not as I do
that's terrible maybe use the line
technique if you're in a cold room with
icy diamond because this stuff is thick
when it's cold so I've carefully lowered
it down exactly where it goes since I'm
not using the thermal grease technique
to hold them in place a lot of them
shift a little bit so all I have to do
is take a screwdriver and make sure that
I realign the the washer before I try to
put the screw in which I've already done
okay so now what I've done is I've gone
ahead and put in all of these screws
into the back of the graphics card now
I've put them all in very very gently
that is to say that they are they're not
finger tight they're not any kind of
tight I've put them in far enough that
the screw touches the PCB but there is
no typing going on right now so Carolyn
I'm gonna do the last one these two
where there's the weird hole for the fan
in the PCB I'm supposed to use these
plastic washers apparently so I've gone
ahead and done that so I'm just gonna
put that in there that is because there
isn't a proper screw hole for those ones
so if I tighten that too much probably
so yeah you can see these are quite
loose they're barely in there so what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go around
and I'm gonna tighten them all watch I'm
using two fingers okay I'm not gonna
overdo it
I'm gonna tighten them about that much
that's all you need
you need contact you're not trying to
mash the PCB into the block this is not
like a CPU block where a ton of mounting
pressure is going to make some kind of
difference in performance so you just
want to give them all a nice little turn
there we go
absolutely diversity there and always
double check
so once we've double-checked to ensure
that we have all of the screws installed
in the back of the video card it is
highly recommended that you actually
remove them all take the whole thing
apart and then check for contact between
the GPU and the block so that means if
they if the thermal pad they're all
still stuck to the block then you want
to check all of the RAM chips and all of
the MOSFETs to see if they have a little
bit of grease enos looking to them if
they're a little bit greasy looking
because that means they were making
contact and same for the GPU core you
want to make sure that it's nice and
well spread out on the block itself so
that you can be sure that everything is
going to be cooled because remember you
can check the temperatures of the GPU
but you can't take to check the
temperatures of all this other stuff
once you've got it installed in your
system so you got to be sure that
they're going to be cooled last thing is
fittings for this you will need wealth
fittings so I'm gonna be salvaging the
older style of stop fittings because I
really don't like the look of the new
ones I find this much more aesthetically
appealing so I'll be grabbing these from
an old ek full cover 8800 block that I
had lying around and I'm also gonna grab
a couple 3/8 compressions fittings that
are compatible with my water cooling
system so basically when you're
installing fittings you want to make
sure a your o-rings are in the proper of
position and be that they are tight most
fittings these days have a recessed
o-ring which means you can't over
tighten them so feel free to crank on
them the technique I used to install
these which is going to make them
impossible to remove by hand was I
actually wrap the grip here and applause
and then I use a pair of vise grips to
tighten them down so those are not
coming off unless I go
my vice grips now so now I'm done
the blocks sexiness factor has increased
the cards sexiness factor by many times
in my opinion and the installation
procedure is complete as far as I'm
concerned although some people would go
further and buy additional back plates
or buy replacement IO plates that are
only single slot so that they can
actually install cards in the slot next
to the graphics card because this is now
a single slot GTX 480 C alright so all
that's left now is to install it in my
system so I'll just take that apart and
that's gonna go in there where the
graphics card is right now thank you for
