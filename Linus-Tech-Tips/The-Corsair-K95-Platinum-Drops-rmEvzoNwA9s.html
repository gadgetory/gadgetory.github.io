you by fresh books the number one cloud
accounting software for freelancers that
lets you save time get paid faster and
get more organized check it out at the
link in the video description we're here
in the corsair booth and they're showing
off the k95 RGB wait both of those
products already exist no this is the
k95 RGB Platinum which is totally
different from the other k95 in k95 RGB
this one has a piece of plastic inside
it from when I dropped it before we
started but don't tell anybody it's a
little be our little secret there are
also some other differences so now in
addition to individually RGB backlit
keys the keyboard now has a logo and a
strip at the top that are as the kids
say lit but in RGB they have also
altered the macro keys on the Left
reducing them from 18 to a mere 6 which
will disappoint Taryn from my team and
according to Corsairs market research
pretty much nobody else the macro Keys
macro key keyboard keyboard keyboard
because most people can't reach any
further than the rightmost column of
macro keys while they're gaming but let
me know in the comments if you guys
disagree with that they've altered the
spacebar putting a textured finish on it
that I personally am really not a huge
fan of but some of the staples of
Corsairs keyboards do remain including
their dedicated media keys and that nice
kind of knurled metal scroll wheel one
big change I am a fan of that has to do
with texture is the wrist rest it now
has either kind of a dimpled texture on
the one side or a more coarse texture on
the other side it's got a really nice
rubberized finish and the whole thing
mounts with magnets whichever way you
choose to put it on it feels and looks
really premium you can't even tell it's
reversible
until you reverse it you're like oh I
like this one better oh I hate this one
I'm going to put it back that's not to
say that I like everything about the
wrist rest so on the bottom you find a
cable management cross for your
headphones so that they can run under
your keyboard if you like having your
headphone wire come up between your
hands while you're gaming but
unfortunately the implementation on the
bottom of the wrist rest is not as good
as
the rest of the bottom of the keyboard
with no clips to hold the wire in place
meaning that you'll either be constantly
fidgeting with it or it might end up
under the rubber stoppers at the bottom
causing the wrist rest to move around a
little bit another thing I'm not a huge
fan of down here is the fact that
they've gone with the cheapo plastic
clips for the wrist rest that inevitably
get broken and given that this is such a
nice wrist rest that I'd love to use
forever I find that a little
disappointing other than that it's got a
USB pass-through and there's not really
a whole lot else to say except it's not
entirely reliant on software for the RGB
lighting anymore you've got to set it up
with cue but once you do that it can
store up to three profiles for all your
macro settings as well as your lighting
effects that you can switch between with
a configurable macro within cue that you
can save on the keyboard so the onboard
memory has been beefed up significantly
it'll be available in two different
colors black worldwide and black and
gunmetal in the US and it's going to be
priced at $1.99 when it comes out so now
seems like a good time to give a huge
