availability of non-reference designs
from Nvidia's partners when they
launched a new GPU but in the case of
the GeForce GTX 980 g1 gaming little
mouthful from gigabyte it's a good thing
we did Corsair Gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision cherry on X RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more now usually with a non
reference graphics card where the board
manufacturer designs their own PCB and
cooler for the GPU they buy from Nvidia
we run through the normal stuff improved
vrm designs for more stable efficient
power delivery and a longer lifespan
better cooler designs for lower card
temperatures and a longer life span and
visual improvements that most folks will
either prefer or not prefer compared to
a reference board but in the case of the
GTX 980 g1 gaming from gigabyte
seriously I gotta stop saying that they
have actually made some serious
improvements here that would make me
consider this card over an Nvidia
designed one we'll start with the stuff
that I only sorta liked the wind force
cooler with its three redesigned 80
millimeter fans looks pretty good
I think gigabyte could improve this in a
couple ways while the random chunk of
metal that increased card height for no
reason is thankfully gone from the older
wind force cards leaving behind a
sleeker housing and the backplate is
gorgeous with angular vent cutouts in a
surprisingly tasteful g1i on it that
wind force logo at the top needs to be
RGB since blue isn't even going to match
gigabytes own g1 series motherboards and
the aluminum fins for the cooler need to
be dark nickel-plated gigabyte does that
and they'll have the best-looking cooler
on the market to go along but they're
quoted 600 watts of total heat
dissipation a number that I truly
believe based on what Luke observed
about the power consumption of this card
once we cranked it and the temps of the
GPU not to mention that it did all of
this while remaining pretty darn quiet
now we can move on to the stuff that
kicks ass the i/o on this board is
perfect
flawless victory gigabyte triple
DisplayPort 1.2 ports for surround
gaming with g-sync or at resolutions
higher than 1440 6 DP off a single card
and HDMI 2.0 and dual dual link DVI
ports for folks with non DisplayPort
monitors to run surround as well you can
even hook up a VGA monitor with a couple
scented Apter thanks to the fact that
one of the DVI ports is dvi-i and
carries an analogue signal this is the
new i/o gold-standard guys speaking of
gold standards gigabyte is calling out
their processor bidding procedure in
their marketing materials now that's a
weird move their name for it is GPU
gauntlet sorting and they're claiming
that their SOC or super overclocked
class cards will guarantee higher
overclocking capabilities
seriously this is right off their site I
guess how much truth there is to this
remains to be seen but if they're
shipping clock speeds or anything to go
by this one is rated at 13 29 megahertz
boost maybe there's something to it
now of course there's the usual gtx 980
technology so long with geforce
experience shadowplay game recording
game stream network gaming on shield
devices and automatic game optimization
and Driver updates and Vidya has added
third generation Delta color compression
to make better use of memory bandwidth
dynamic super resolution a way of
running less than ending games at higher
res than downsampling them to the
resolution of your monitor for better
visuals mfa a a new less demanding
anti-aliasing mode and auto asynchronous
warp a VR feature that should improve
the experience for users of the oculus
rift or similar head tracking head
mounted displays who are prone to motion
sickness you can get more in-depth
explanations of these technologies in my
reference gtx 980 video linked here but
now it's time to put this card to the
test as usual we'll be overclocking not
only the GTX 980 g1 gaming but also all
the cards it's going up against so we
shall see how it fares all right guys
first up we have overclocking to see the
settings for all of my cards check out
the overclocking dock in the description
of this video
this card specifically was configured
and after
with a core voltage offset of 70 a power
limit of 100 and 22% a core clock offset
of 160 and a temperature target of 91
which resulted in its actual core clock
averaging around 15 31 215 61 in terms
of benchmarking results I was happy to
see that the extra overclocking Headroom
allowed by this card gave it enough of
an advantage to achieve a clear win and
all of my gaming benchmarks in both
1080p and 4k and upon further inspection
I noted that it did this while
maintaining a heavy load running
temperature of only 70 degrees Celsius
the power draw on the other hand was a
little bit surprising
instead of being drastically lower than
our reference 780ti like our reference
980 was this wind force cooled extra
power pens gtx 980 actually drew more
overall system power which may suggest
that gigabyte is binning leakier chips
for enthusiast grade cards resulting in
higher potential performance at the cost
of power efficiency anyways just some
food for thought and back to you guys
thanks Luke so there you have it is the
gigabyte GTX 980 g1 gaming and
enthusiasts delight do you prefer
gigabytes design that favors folks with
high airflow cases and beefy power
supplies or would you rather have
invidious reference blower cooler that
exhausts air outside of the case and
lower power consumption at the cost of
some GPU overclocked ability let us know
in the comments speaking of the comments
on this video I know they're going to be
chock-full of appreciation for today's
sponsor little bits there are brand new
sponsor here on Linus tech tips and we
think they have a pretty awesome concept
and we know that many of you will agree
their goal is to lead a hardware
renaissance where everyone regardless of
age gender technical ability or
discipline can be creative with
electronics they offer over 60 modules
with a wide range of complexity their
simplest ones include power sensors and
LEDs and then they range all the way up
to programmable wireless capable modules
with little bits you don't have to be an
expert to tinker with electronics so no
matter what background or skill level
you currently have they're going to have
something for you and for Linus tech
tips viewers they're offering a savings
of 20
Soph your first kit when you head over
to little gets calm and use offer code
Linus so whether you're a young maker
just getting started or a seasoned pro
who wants to cut down on prototyping
time head over to little bits comm and
check out what they have to offer thank
you guys for watching this video on
gigabytes g1 gaming geforce gtx 980
superb overclocked gtx graphics card
anyway sorry I got carried away with the
longness of the name there like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment letting me
know if your feelings are more
complicated than this check out the link
in the video description to our support
us link you can buy a plantation like
this one give us a monthly contribution
or change your amazon bookmark to one in
fire affiliate code so we get a small
kickback whenever you buy stuff on
Amazon say for example graphics cards
