product this is the silverstone air
penetrator and i said that with a
straight face it is a breakthrough
computer fan with air channeling
technology it has low power consumption
but what fan doesn't it has
industry-leading air ten Loida no it is
an industry-leading air channeling fan
it has wide fan blades for reducing air
resistance it is a standard 120
millimeter frame for maximum
compatibility with CPU coolers it has an
integrated air channeling grille double
as fan guard to reduce overall size the
fluid dynamic bearing is for high
reliability so there's a little bit of
an inconsistency to the way that these
bullet points are laid out but I'm not
going to hold it against them too much
it is a transparent blue UV fan with a
black blade and we're just going to open
it up and talk about it more once it is
open and I will have to cut the sticker
because I didn't realize that the fan is
actually sealed so I have a knife knives
are good except when they cut you and
not in the box that very rarely happens
with me down so I don't worry about it
too much ok so inside for accessories we
have rubber mounts to go with the air
penetration then we have four fan screws
so those are metal mounts then we have a
molex this is a good feature I love
these so this is a 4-pin molex to either
12 volt 7 volt or 5 volt power so you
can use that too as a fan control not
use it as a fan controller this is a fan
controller so instead of if you plug it
into your instead of plugging it into
your motherboard header where some other
boards will also allow you to control
the fan speed from you can just plug it
into here so ok I want it to run full
speed so just plug it in like that and
then plug it directly into the power
supply we'll have a closer look at the
fan and just know we'll have a closer
look at the fan now so here are the wide
UV blue blades and you can see that they
are quite wide compared to most fans
ok you know what let's get down to the
feature that actually matters this what
this does is it makes it so that the air
comes out like this and you know what
silverstone actually has a pretty cool
demo of this on
their site so I'm just going to go ahead
and sort of navigate there well you take
in the coolness of this fan that the
cameraman is pointing the camera at and
here you should filled in this diagram
to because that's the most interesting
part so while it may seem
counterintuitive that I'm going to show
you in my youtube video someone else's
YouTube video I'll do that in a moment
so why don't we plug it in and have a
look at what the noise is like so that
means that I'll actually stop talking
for a minute which might be nice for the
cameraman so we're plugging it in at 12
volts here so the camera can sort of lit
yet you know it's going to be impossible
to hear anything it's really quiet
actually I'm impressed it's very quiet
okay it's hard to tell if I'm really
noticing the directed airflow but the
whole idea behind this fan is that it's
great for use as an intake fan because
the air comes out in like a wind sort of
tunnel channelled effect so it all comes
out sort of here whereas with a normal
fan it just kind of blows all over the
place and so that's what these that's
what these this grill is for so why
don't we plug it in at seven volts just
to sort of you know
make a point here that it's all so quiet
at seven volts Wow
I'm a bit of a silence freak but I'm
actually really impressed by this it's
not producing very much noise at all at
seven volts or it's moving a fairly
decent amount of air that's pretty good
okay that video is finally loaded so we
can stop killing time so here they're
showing the I think this is the other
fan this is some random fan yeah yes
okay so that's how airflow normally
works from a fan and then they show the
air penetrator here so see how it blows
it straight out instead of all over the
place there you go that was the whole
point thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the silverstone ap1 21 air
penetrator 120 millimeter computer case
cooling fan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
