feminine-hygiene emergency and cannot
leave the house to get her own bio waste
management products so it's on you but
you do not feel like going to the local
grocery store and listening to the
cashier making that stale joke about
your own flow so what's the solution
well for us it was to get in the car
drive two-and-a-half hours down to
Seattle and visit the Amazon go pilot
location the world's only retail store
where you do not have to have any human
interaction whatsoever you just grab
what you want put it in your bag and
leave but what's the experience like
well we're gonna tell you after we tell
you about Tunnel Bear be easy to use VPN
that makes the internet a more open
place giving everyone access to the same
content check them out at Tunnel Bear
comm /l TT will have that linked below
okay so step one is to get the Amazon Go
app once you're signed into your account
you don't need Prime this QR code right
here allows you to scan in any guests
that are with you though do note that
anything they take will be charged to
your account and then enter the store
you can't get in without your phone but
Amazon says that handy-dandy Amazon
staff members will be on hand with
charging banks if for whatever reason
you need to juice up before you go in so
let's try it I mean okay we're inside so
it kind of looks like a regular grocery
store so how does it work
Amazon isn't being too specific about
the details but we do know a few things
one is that the place is absolutely
peppered with cameras see those black
boxes up there there are literally
hundreds of cameras inside what is only
an 1,800 square foot store according to
one article I read they are designed to
read camera friendly codes that are
printed out on each of the items but
these just look like regular UPC codes
so I'm actually not sure about that what
we do know is that while it was present
in the original patent filing RFID
technology is not being used and we also
know that they are using computer vision
algorithms in order to understand what
you're picking up and they are also
assisting this technology with
additional sensors like for example
weight sensors in the shelves themselves
pressure sensors and load cells each of
those components together increases
Amazon's confidence in what exactly it
is that you have picked up and put in
your bag or your pocket or whatever the
case may be so in terms of product mix
and pricing it's not like a giant
grocery store like you can't even buy a
full gallon of milk or anything like
that but I mean it's pretty competitive
with what you'd expect from like a
neighborhood grocer or like like a
corner store like this
curried chicken wrap is six bucks whoa
what this is interesting
so these food items these are marked
with those camera recognizable codes
that I was talking about before because
I guess you know if it doesn't come in a
package it's a lot harder to tell the
difference between curried chicken wrap
and
tuna wrap Oh BK b kelly b k LT wrap does
this have kale in it you guys are you
guys are killing me here
bacon kale lettuce tomato wrap I mean if
I'm gonna have like the trendy Seattle
experience I gotta have the wrap with
the kale in it would you want Dennis
well I don't know man I don't know what
to tell you okay then just get it I tell
you man this is like weird stuff cuz
like normally sitting in a store putting
stuff in your backpack like here let's
get something to drink - Dennis what you
want want Apple I'm getting snapped and
the sunburn drinks I don't think so no I
don't think so sorry you're gonna have
to have the only like 98% Amazon
experience here
harmless coconut water do you want the
harmful one or the harmless one you want
the harmful one well this one's harmless
I don't like I feel like someone's gonna
come tackle me okay so we got all our
snacks now we've got to get what we
actually came here for we can choose
between the always infinity and the
Tampax pearl let's let's go with the
let's go see always right here but with
a twist I have a challenge for their
system I want to see how it handles me
putting this down in the wrong place and
then picking it back up all right thank
you yeah cool let's say I'm shopping
first an alcohol and I kind of go do I
really want this not sure
I want to see how it handles it aha yep
yep okay you know what I actually don't
want some alcohol after all but if I
come back without these I'm gonna get in
all sorts of trouble so let's head for
the exit like my reflex as I'm walking
towards the exit is like okay I gotta
get ready to take off my bag and take my
stuff out and put it on the thing so
theoretically now as I walk through what
they're calling the transition area
Amazon is going to do a small
transaction on my credit card
$1.00 just to validate that it's working
then they're gonna build a balance of it
once they've totaled up everything that
I took
bear in mind guys that if you over draw
your credit card that's on you to deal
with any kind of penalties or fees that
are associated with that so here it is
there we go there we go nice get up and
go your trip time was 26 minutes and 27
seconds your receipt is ready check this
out so Amazon is actually so confident
in their system that they've built in a
feature where if for whatever reason
you're charged for something that you
didn't take you can actually just remove
it and crazily enough they're using the
honor system which if you think about it
actually isn't that crazy because it's
tied into your Prime account which is
tied into your credit card Amazon can
use machine learning not to mention just
common sense in order to figure out if
people are abusing the system okay so
let's see how we did
boom got it very a however that's
pronounced got it
bacon tail lettuce and tomato wrap diet
Snapple iced tea raspberry diet and
coconut water nailed it okay so it got
everything but how does the system
handle an item that was accidentally not
charged cuz I mean nothing's perfect
well Amazon so confident in their system
and seemingly rightly so that they have
actually apparently told another news
outlet that managed to walk out with a
yogurt they didn't pay for you know what
go ahead keep it the yogurts on us
because they seem to believe that the
system is so accurate that even with
those occasional misfires they're still
going to make up for the cost of
cashiers plain clothes loss prevention
security people and well just the normal
shock lifting that retailers refer to as
shrink not bad considering it's got kale
in it actually I was really good
maybe the craziest thing about this
whole experience is that let's say I
decided this you know kale sucked or uh
you know what I don't need these pads
after all if I wanted to return them at
this time there is literally no
mechanism to take this back you you'd
have to talk to an associate and give it
to them but the way that the refund
would be processed would be identical
you would just go into your receipt you
would select an item and you would
remove it I don't need it or whatever
and no questions asked they will give
you a refund not only do you not have to
return it there is no mechanism to
return it they're gonna have to find a
solution to that in the long term okay
so in summary that was really freaking
cool but as some of you may have noticed
it is now go for a walk in the rain time
because there are definitely still some
issues and some concerns that I have
about this technology so issue number
one is that before Amazon as they are
undoubtedly gonna do in the next year or
two rolls this out in Whole Foods
locations they acquired them less than
about a year ago now they're gonna have
to figure out how to address the limit
on the number of customers that can be
in the store at one time right now you
just make a line outside the store but
if your whole pitch is line up with
shopping that's obviously a dumb
long-term solution issue number two is
that a tree
additional grocery stores loyalty
program actually tells them a lot more
about you than just what you bought with
data especially if you're a regular
shopper like what you buy how much of it
and how often they can extrapolate a lot
about not just you but also your family
and Amazon hasn't talked a ton about
what data they're collecting how long
they're keeping it for there's nothing
go specific in their privacy policy but
if I was a betting man I would put good
money on Amazon collecting all kinds of
extra data like your movement patterns
around the store
how long you looked at a particular item
before buying it or not buying it which
advertising kiosks were endcaps you
found the most attractive and they're
gonna use that combined with what they
already know about you from your online
profile to build an incredibly detailed
picture of who you are and what you're
about and this ignores some of the less
obvious societal issues that we're gonna
be facing as technology like this
becomes more prevalent so it's estimated
that in America right now there are
three and a half million cashiers and
you know Amazon side of this story is
that you know yeah we don't have any
cashiers but we're still gonna need
humans for food prep restocking the
shelves checking ID in the alcoholic
beverages section they say they're still
going to need humans for that for the
foreseeable future but you know I'm kind
of looking at this going well yeah but
regular grocery stores also need people
for food prep and stocking shelves I'm
not sure if this math is gonna add up
and you know if I were to be sitting
here with a crystal ball figuring out
what I think the future is gonna be I
see no reason why those jobs couldn't
eventually be replaced as well so that's
something that we are going to have to
figure out as people over the next yeah
we don't have as long to deal with
as we might have hoped speaking of not
having a long time to deal with
something have you ever called your
mobile carrier and been stuck on hold
for like 10 minutes 20 minutes trying to
deal with something well not with ting
