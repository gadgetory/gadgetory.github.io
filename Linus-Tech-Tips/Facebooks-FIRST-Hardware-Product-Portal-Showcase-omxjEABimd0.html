are of course Nvidia PhysX and 3d vision
which whoa who are you I'm you but from
the future 26 it is crazy the phones
there are no headphone jacks what's I
know and who are you I'm you and you
from the even more future in 2018 a new
hardware product will come out from
Facebook what yeah they're making
hardware now please wait I was writing
to us you guys are interrupting my video
I finally make awesome content today
both of you future line I won't exist
you gotta get out of here quick take the
pourer
Facebook is sponsoring a showcase you've
got to complete it before I before
what's this showcase
the portal and the portal Plus from
Facebook are not quite like any device
that we've seen before because portal is
specifically about making video calls
feel more personal so Facebook's goal
here is to make your video calls feel as
much like an in-person hangout as
possible hence the name so how would it
do that I mean obviously Facebook
doesn't have some never-before-seen
camera under screen technology that
would allow you to make eye contact and
look at the person at the same time
maybe that'll come in the future but
they did manage to give portal at least
three main ways to make video calls more
immersive first portal is hands-free
when you have a live conversation with
someone you're not holding their little
face out in front of you
no your hands are free to talk all
Italian or you know cook or whatever the
case may be but it's not just that
portal is totally freestanding or even
that you don't have to touch it in order
to place or answer calls hey portal call
Colton no I don't want to talk to that
guy it's that the camera will actually
reframe as you move around your space
and automatically widen the shot if more
people enter the room it's not as fast
as your eyes but it goes a long way
towards making conversations more
natural especially since you can wander
pretty far thanks to the cameras 140
degree field of view the second way
portal makes you feel more present is
kind of related to the first one
it's called spotlight so if you were in
a room full of people but only one of
them was let's say opening a present for
example your eyes would probably want to
focus in on that and follow that action
instead of giving everything in the room
equal attention like most cameras do
with portal you just double tap on the
person you're interested in and the
camera will keep them in frame just like
your own eyes would if you were in the
room finally number three is audio with
to full range drivers to tweeters and a
4-inch sub as well as a 4 microphone
array portal has a lot more audio
hardware than your typical video calling
device and it works well to keep your
friends voices from sounding well like a
speakerphone perhaps more importantly
though portal signal
assessing what they call smart sound
does a solid job of enhancing the voice
of whoever's talking and minimizing
background noise even as you move around
the room it still sound pretty clear
from far away now given the focus on
video calling I'm sure it doesn't come
as a surprise that Facebook has built in
some extras by pressing this button you
can activate the same filters that you'd
find in messenger it's got a really cute
storytime feature that adds sounds and
AR effects and it allows you to listen
to music together
don't worry though you have to accept
someone's request to have your portal
just start playing music and thankfully
you each have your own independent
volume controls this is actually a
feature that I'd expect to become more
popular as people get used to the idea
and as Facebook expands their music
service support because right now each
person has to have either a Pandora or a
Spotify Premium account bringing us to
the elephant in the room
none of these cool features mean diddly
if the product doesn't take privacy
safety and security seriously so what
has Facebook done in that department
well like other voice enabled devices
portal only sends voice commands to
Facebook servers after you say hey
portal and you can delete your voice
history in the Facebook activity log
then if you want to physically
disconnect portal from even being able
to connect to the cloud you can toggle
the camera and the microphone off with
this button up here and when you do
you'll see this red light these icons
and this toast telling you that they're
off and if that's still not enough for
you Facebook actually went out of their
way to include this little camera cover
inside the box but wait there's more
Facebook says that all their video calls
are encrypted so they don't listen to
view or keep the contents of your portal
video calls and the AI technology used
by the camera runs locally on portal not
on Facebook servers and even though
portal smart cameras can keep you in
frame Facebook is verified with us that
while it does recognize the shape of a
human versus say a couch it does not
have facial recognition period that's a
definite plus as is the fact that
surprisingly portal has Amazon Alexa
built
I didn't so you could check the weather
control your smart lights set timers and
all that good stuff it's also got a
handful of other apps including food
network and Facebook's watch video app
so cool but how much does it cost well I
was actually legitimately quite
surprised to learn that the smaller
portal equipped with a 10.1 inch 1200 by
800 screen 10 watt speakers 12 megapixel
camera is only $1.99 while the larger
portal plus has the same internals in
camera but with a 15.6 inch 1920 by 1080
screen 20 watt speakers and an
accelerometer which lets the screen go
like this and this one is 349 not only
that but they have a deal where you can
get any two devices big small or a mix
and get $100 off so the Facebook portal
is available now so you can get yours
today from Amazon Best Buy or directly
from portal facebook.com check them out
at the links in the video description so
thanks to Facebook for sponsoring this
video
