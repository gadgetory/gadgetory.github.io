brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital here in the Western
Digital booth they're showing off the my
cloud now to be clear guys this is an
external hard drive it's an as okay so
there's a three and a half inch drive
inside it's available on two three or
four terabyte configurations on the back
you can see you've got your standard USB
3 Gigabit LAN and power in you also got
some ventilation holes so you might be
going okay well Linus why are they
calling this the mic loud and the answer
is that it's all about the software and
while personal cloud has been something
that's existed for quite some time that
is to say using your own personal
storage for all of your off-site backup
for your your cloud backup so you can
carry your files around with you even
when you're on your phone this has
existed but what WD is trying to do here
is make it much simpler and much more
accessible for regular people so it's
got the usual PC or Mac that's it that
is to say is compatible of Time Machine
backups it's got the usual DLNA server
so it does all that stuff that a WD NAS
normally does but where the key
differentiator comes in is in the mobile
software so it's super easy to set up
you connect to the my cloud and then you
can do all the kinds of things you would
expect to be able to do with a service
such as Dropbox or Google Drive that is
to say you can pull down files at any
time and then view them on your phone or
on your tablet or other device even
another computer you can upload our
backup files from your device to your my
cloud for access at a later date and you
can even actually synchronize my cloud
so that is your personal cloud with
other cloud services such as a SkyDrive
or Google Drive now it's available in
that single drive configuration but it's
also available with the my cloud ex4
this is like I don't know it's somewhere
between a personal device and like like
a small office/home office device it
accepts up to four drives it supports
raid zero one five and ten and it's got
redundancy so you can see it has two
power inputs two Gigabit LAN so it's got
failover there it also has two USB 3
ports for additional expansion instead
of just one and it comes at least the
one we're looking at here with no drives
installed so you can
chili mix-and-match and picked your own
storage configuration up to 16 terabytes
of raw storage for your own personal
cloud which you can then configure
whatever way you want so guys this has
been the my cloud stay tuned because we
are getting our hands on a unit we are
definitely going to be doing a review so
that's me gonna be coming soon stay
tuned for that guys thank you for
checking out this video from the Western
Digital booth here at CES 2014 our trip
to the show is powered by NCI XCOM your
source for great technology selection
and service as well as Western Digital
and courser memory without those guys we
would not be able to be here bringing
