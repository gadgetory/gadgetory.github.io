Sabretooth z77 motherboard this is what
I would consider to be a true successor
to the saber-tooth p67 because it brings
back that did after the thermal armor so
the exclusive thermal armor armor covers
the entire board with dual turbo fans
directing cooler to critical parts and
dissipating heat faster for better
stability Tough Series motherboards
better be stable and they better have
high quality components because they
come with a five-year warranty these are
the only issues motherboards that do
come with a five-year warranty and they
have a number of features to back it up
so first of all we've got the thermal
armor we'll show you that in a moment
Thermal radar this is really cool if you
check out on my NCIX comm channel I've
got a video where I talk about the a
seuss specific features of their z77
boards where I show you thermal radar
it's really really cool
dust defender repel the dust expand the
lifespan I'll show you those in just a
minute you can cover your slots when you
are not using them tough components
certified by military standard so there
you go you're going to give a five-year
warranty on something you better make
sure you're using proper components that
are going to last a long time
new DIGI+ power control so this is 8th
generation digital power control from
Asus meaning you are controlling the RAM
the CPU and the integrated GPU USB flash
bios flashback allows you to easily
recover your BIOS in the event of a
failure even without a CPU and RAM
installed network eye control allows you
to prioritize various applications
through AI suite in order to make sure
that your you know utorrent that's
running in the background is not
affecting your pings in your game server
UEFI BIOS we take that for granted these
days USB 3 boost is also available
whether it's just the regular boost mode
or you ASP with compatible devices on
the A's as media controller USB charger
plus allows you to charge up to three
times faster
ESD cards in theory protect the board
from electrostatic discharge yes we - is
there software that allows you to
control this stuff and finally complete
USB 3
whatever they mean by complete usb3 I'm
not quite sure I think they mean they
have a front panel header and rear panel
ports they also have both Intel and
third-party chipsets supported on this
particular board because the z77 chipset
does include Intel USB 3 ports however
the Intel USB 3 ports and don't support
you ASP at this time so you're going to
want to use the as media controller if
you want to get the best performance
possible so this platform is using the
z77 chipset which means you got support
for 22 or 32 nanometer CPUs that is
second generation or third generation
Ivy Bridge Intel Core i3 i5 and i7
processors we've also got support for
Intel Smart Response technology which
means that you can use an SSD to cache
your boot drive nvidia sli and AMD
crossfire x technology are supported
virtue MVP gives you the ability to a
plug in a dedicated graphics card still
make use of quick sync technology which
is the integrated GPUs a quick video
encoding as well as use the integrated
GPU as a way to augment the performance
of your dedicated GPU as a way to reduce
the tearing that is caused by frame
rates that are above the refresh rate of
your monitor and finally with the newer
virtue you don't have to worry about
whether you plug into the dedicated
graphics card or the integrated graphics
card you can switch to I Mon or D mode
whichever you prefer
okay now let's do access erease really
quick here I've actually opened some of
these already guys because I did already
use this motherboard to film my other
video and slick in his infinite wisdom
opened up the board before we prepped
the other video and before we had a
chance to unbox it so he's feeling the
shame right now all right so we've got
some pieces here that we took off the
board in order to install these fans so
there's a fan right here on the chipset
blowing air down in order to direct air
exactly where it needs to go so through
the chipset fins across any of the other
chips that are installed on the board
itself and you know eventually sort of
out the gaps around it there's also a
fan here so this I would probably
suggest using it as an
instead of as an intake but I guess the
choice is yours
the slick installed this one and then
next we've got our dust covers so this
one this one these basically allow you
to keep dust from accumulating in slots
that you're not using Asus has included
a full complement of them for the PCI
Express slots as well as look at these
these are cool so we've got other
placeholders for the RAM slots that
we're not using so you don't look they
can go either way
they've got slots so you don't have to
worry about which way you install them
take Mike and going that way and going
that way there you go
so your board will look like really
sweet even if you have absolutely
nothing installed on it so if you're
into aesthetics which I happen to be
that is cool all right io Shield
including a cutout for the fan at the
back so that you're going to get
adequate ventilation we've also got a
poor SATA cables
two of them are SATA three to the
Mercedes two but it doesn't actually
matter they're both single to right
angle or all four of them are single to
right angle SLI connector right there
cute connectors for your front USB as
well as your front panel headers for
your power and whatnot you've got a
driver and utilities DVD you don't use
that download the latest from the Asus
website you've also got a certificate of
reliability it's gold and top Series
five year warranty notice that's the one
I'm concerned about not this one so much
because that means Isis is going to
stand behind it you've also got a
sticker that you can put on your case
tough inside no sorry can you see that
there we go cool moving on let's have a
look at the layout of the board which is
quite tricky because it's completely
covered with the thermal armor which you
can take off should you see fit
so we've got our CPU socket right here
LGA 1155 supporting the latest Intel
processors we've also got our eight pin
power connector and it's ideal location
at the top left of the board we've got
our 24 pin power connector and it's
ideal location on the right-hand edge
there's the memo K button that means
even if you're using a high-performance
dims you can use that button to ensure
that it will post no matter what we've
got a front USB 3.0 header very good
orientation of this love it good job
Asus thumbs up because this will run
more easily to your front pad
and will require less you know kinking
of the cable and you don't want
something coming out like this if you're
buying this board you probably care
about the look of your build this will
help next we've got four SATA to three
gigabit per second ports to say two
three six gigabit per second ports and
two more say two three six gigabit per
second ports running off of a third
party chipset so those guys are just
like here's our front panel headers for
your power and reset and all that good
stuff three USB two front panel
connectors moving on we've got a power
LED we've got clear CMOS jumper prefer
to see a switch especially on a gaming
oriented board but it is what it is
we've got our Thunderbolt header yes so
you can install an optional isus
accessory into this slot and then plug
that into the Thunderbolt header and you
will add Thunderbolt support to your
board debug port as well as front panel
audio at both right here and moving
along we've got the PCI Express slot
layout so we've got one two three PCIe
1x slot three PCIe 16x slots although
it's going to run at 16 X or 8 X 8 X and
I really wouldn't recommend running a
graphics card in here this is more
intended for accessories you know LAN
card raid card Thunderbolt card whatever
else the case may be moving along to the
back we've got our usual assortment of
ports so 4 USB 2.0 ports the BIOS flash
back button so handy so useful to eSATA
ports 4 USB 3.0 ports 2 of those running
off of a third-party chipset and 2 of
them running off of an Intel chipset
DisplayPort and HDMI video out optical
audio out as well as 7.1 audio now I
want to show you guys where all of the
fan headers are because you can use the
AI Suite software in order to configure
custom fan curves 1 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 asu's
has done a fantastic job of putting all
the relevant ports around the very
outside of the edge of this board in
order to keep a clean aesthetic that is
not easy so they have done a tremendous
amount of work in order to make things
convenient for you so I hope you guys
appreciate it here's another cool thing
check this out ventilation holes in the
board
I call them bullet holes but I don't
think
that's actually a Seuss's intention but
check this out so we got likes like
random ventilation holes like in the
board I think these ones are for the
socket itself but yeah there's like some
ventilation holes and whatnot pretty
cool right
perforated PCB that's like the latest
technology I'm not even joking thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the saber-tooth z77 this looks
laughing he's making me lose it don't
forget to subscribe to - tech tips from
Ron unboxings reviews and other computer
videos miss something PCI Express 3.0 is
supported on this motherboard as long as
you are using a CPU that has a built in
PCI Express 3.0 controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
