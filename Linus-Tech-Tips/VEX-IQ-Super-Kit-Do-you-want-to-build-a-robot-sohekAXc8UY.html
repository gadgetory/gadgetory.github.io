robotics videos today we've got the vex
IQ super kit from vex robotics vex IQ
was introduced about two years ago and
it's chiefly targeted at elementary to
middle school students for those of you
who don't know what this is all about
robotics kits like the ones from tetrax
make block Mindstorms and vex are
basically educational toys sort of I
mean they're not exactly toys but I
don't know what else to call them you
won't really be able to build a
practical useful robot that will dress
you in the morning or vacuum your floor
or cook your dinner that's not really
the point the purpose of these robotics
kits as far as I can tell is the
enormous amount of educational value
that they provide while still being a
ton of fun when you build with this
stuff you're learning a huge amount
about mechanical engineering and
programming and there is so much to
learn so let's dig in and see what the
vex IQ system has to offer and hit that
like button if you want to see more
robotics videos in the future
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click now to learn more
so if you want to get started with a vex
IQ robot you've basically got three
choices there's the starter kit with a
radio remote control and two touch
sensors there's the starter kit with no
remote control but it has seven sensors
then there's the super kit which has the
remote control and the seven sensors but
is fifty dollars more which I think is
well worth it that's the kid I'll be
reviewing today it comes with eight
hundred and fifty parts which you can
use to build and program pretty much any
kind of robot you can imagine and there
are instructions for several models to
get you started the learning ceiling is
surprisingly high while still being easy
enough for beginners to get started with
but we'll talk more about that later so
opening up the box we see hey what's
this it comes with its own storage bin
and a compartmentalized tray 50 points
to Gryffindor that's great there's
plenty of extra room to allow your
collection of X parts to grow you can
even fit a second tray above the first
one looks like you won't be needing to
take any trips down to the Container
Store which is actually a cooler place
than it sounds anyway the vex IQ kit
comes with a getting started guide to
instructional booklets and a poster with
all of the pieces at one-to-one scale
for reference purposes next we get to
the included sensors oh yes these are
awesome
there are seven in total and they're all
small and easy to mount anywhere on to
your robot we've got to bumper switches
these will let your robot know when it's
run into something there is an
ultrasonic distance sensor these use
echolocation to measure distances to
objects that's always fun and there's a
light and color sensor useful for line
following detecting colors and measuring
ambient brightness and then my favorite
the gyro sensor which measures turn
rates and angles very useful for
orientation there are also two touch
LEDs which I don't really think of as
sensors they can't really be used as
extra bumper switches they're more like
extra buttons each one also has fully
programmable RGB LEDs which I've always
found to be very useful for debugging
and knowing where you are in a program
then we get to the smart motors and
guess what there are four of them and
they're all pretty powerful too not only
that but they're easy to mount not too
bulky or oddly shaped and they all have
encoders and micro
processors inside to measure all sorts
of cool stuff you can even stall them
without having to worry about damage
next up we've got the radio controller
which is great but it could be better it
feels kind of cheap and the buttons are
a bit soggy
especially the shoulder buttons which
rotate as they press inward rather than
going in straight also my left joystick
has a bit of a problem it doesn't go all
the way to the left I've been told that
this is a known issue which has been
fixed in the most recent batch I
recalibrated mine for full functionality
but vex says they're glad to do RMA's if
customers aren't happy
despite this the controller is
functionally excellent and it definitely
is still worth getting the two joysticks
give you proportional control in every
direction and on top of that you've got
eight buttons and it's all fully
programmable and customizable in
software it also comes with a 50 hour
rechargeable battery and then I mention
it's radio-controlled that's a big deal
unlike infrared with radio you don't
need line-of-sight to your robot so you
won't get easily disconnected compare
this to the Mindstorms ev3 infrared
beacon with five buttons but no
joysticks and the tetrax gamepad with
two joysticks but no buttons and now we
get to the centerpiece of the vex IQ
system the fully programmable robot
brain this is where you connect all of
your sensors and motors using the
included rj12 cables this thing has 12
serial ports that can be used as input
or output so yeah if you wanted to you
could hook up 12 motors the brain also
comes with its own rechargeable battery
so there's no need to periodically
sacrifice several double a's at a time
to the robot guards there's also a spot
for the radio module that easily links
to the controller and it even has a
backlit screen at this point I think
they're just showing off as for the rest
of the parts there's a wide variety of
beams pins wheels gears axles corner
connectors rubber bands and even double
and quadruple wide beams and metal axles
which are overkill in most cases all the
parts are strong and good quality but
the axles can be pretty and annoying
because they grip either too much or not
enough you can use rubber shaft collars
for extra grip but that can waste a lot
of space the LEGO Group solve this
problem with expansion gaps on all axle
holes a feature that Veck
iq does not currently have to recap the
super kit comes with four motors seven
sensors 12 in out ports on the fully
programmable brain a radio controller a
rechargeable battery and 850 pieces this
is all really impressive when you
compare the vex IQ system to its primary
competition Lego Mindstorms of which the
newest iteration is eb-3 the ev3 kit
comes with three motors three sensors
and the brain brick has four input ports
four sensors and four output ports four
motors but they can't be swapped so you
couldn't hook up eight motors if you
wanted to and it requires double-a and
triple-a batteries which are not
included
while the Lego Mindstorms ev3 has 550
pieces and costs 350 dollars the vex IQ
super kit has 850 pieces and only costs
$300 Wow
that is some good value so that's the
hardware let's get onto the software
there are two programming options for
vex IQ mod kit and robot C there are
also several third-party alternatives
but those are not officially supported
the desktop version of mod kit is 50
bucks but the online version is fully
featured and free so let's check that
out first mod kit is a purely graphical
programming interface based on scratch
from MIT you do have to install
something called mod kit link on your
computer first but at least that's
pretty easy you program in mod kit by
connecting these various code blocks
together it's pretty straightforward and
if you're new to all this there are a
few getting started tutorials to help
you along but that's all that there is
just getting started
once you've gotten started the tutorials
run out there are no more where are the
intermediate and advanced tutorials I
looked all over the place but couldn't
find any now I can see that despite its
simplicity mod kit does have a lot more
to offer than the tutorials tell you
about but without any further guidance I
ended up learning mod kit through
rigorous trial and error this always
works but it's slow and frustrating and
you're more likely to end up with gaps
in your knowledge I did program a pretty
cool pinball game though check out that
video on channel super fun right over
here I also encountered a couple of bugs
and missing features the worst of which
is the lack of copy paste but it was
nothing game breaking unlike my
experience with make block video here
what
move on to the more advanced programming
option robots see which has a ten day
free trial and after that costs 79 bucks
for a single seat one important note the
vex firmware updater tool that works
well for mod kit is very unreliable for
robots see here it looks like my
firmware is updated doesn't it but it's
not I had to close the dedicated
firmware updater tool and download
firmware through robot C instead and
keep that updater tool closed because it
interferes with your serial port
seriously what is it with serial ports
and connection problems it's frustrating
anyway first up we've got the robot C
graphical mode there are some great
tutorials for this which seem to be
pretty comprehensive it's kind of
similar to market but it actually has
less functionality there are no
functions and no variables and like mod
kit there isn't a working copy paste or
undo but you can turn your graphical
code straight into text-based code with
the click of a button which certainly
helps to smooth out the programming
learning curve so let's move on to robot
C's text-based mode it's worth noting at
this point that vex IQ comes with a free
online curriculum for students and
teachers it explains all sorts of robot
stuff in detail but once you get to the
actual programming it just says become
familiar with the programming software
and doesn't bother to tell you how now
there are tutorials link from the
software page which I've been following
but there's nothing for text-based
robots c4 vex IQ so how is someone
supposed to learn how to use robot C
well I made some phone calls and I got
an interview with local vex IQ team
leader cheresa she tells me her students
teach themselves first I have a problem
because I'm not a programming teacher
when it comes to see it's my my club
that really gets involved in this and
they take it kind of on their own time
to learn the language and I really don't
have a lot of a part of that well then
it looks like I'll have to piece
everything together using the online
documentation the included example
programs and the forums and wiki that's
okay but without a dedicated tutorial to
give you a solid foundation of knowledge
in robots see your progress will be
slower and you're more likely to end up
with gaps in your knowledge at least
that's been my experience one suggestion
I've heard is
you can just learn see itself there are
plenty of tutorials and books to help
you with that and then robot C will be
easy yeah however you do it once you
learn robot C you will have full control
over your robot creations
even though robot C is apparently not as
full featured as C itself I was able to
program some cool stuff like a PID line
follower a self-parking robot and a
robot that only hordes rescue robots C
works pretty well but it's got some
problems too the windows can get messed
up especially when you enter debugging
mode and the windows freaked out for a
couple of seconds and you can't do
anything I also encountered a bug where
robot C crashed when the debugger was
launched something I had to fix by
deleting registry files and reinstalling
also I really wish that robot C had
something like the function screen tips
in Microsoft Excel that kind of guidance
is really useful when you're still
learning to code however it looks to me
like not many students will even learn
to program in robot C for their vex IQ
robots instead they'll learn it when
they move on to the bigger badder vex
edr robots which are aimed at older
students in middle to high school at
this point I've really come to
understand that vex IQ is not really
intended for individuals like myself
it's been designed for teams and
classrooms and it's a lot easier to
learn all this stuff if you have other
people around you to help you in fact
there are yearly vex competitions with
hundreds of participating teams
something which provides an excellent
environment that encourages students to
learn programming engineering
collaboration teamwork and so on you
know it's basically a sport like
basketball but for your brain brain
sketball
anyway considering that vex IQ is so
classroom oriented sarissas perspective
as an educator is particularly important
for this review so I'll let her provide
some concluding remarks this school
board has a restriction as to like with
software you can install on your
computers and have a robot programming
platform that is free and web-based is a
call from the heaven so then you would
recommend the vex IQ system for teaching
controller and I kind of like an
advocate for this stuff at these very
eager students they had a hard time
grasping programming and I feel like
effects I
you kind of fills in that gap for
between 250 and $299 Canadian you can
purchase a box that has all the pieces
in it and everything necessary to build
one robot with step by step instruction
affordability I think it's fair so there
you have it
I recommend it sure is recommend it what
more do you want that all being said I
do have quite the laundry list of
suggestions for improvements to the
system ranging from nice to have to why
don't you have this vex robotics has
already proven that they listen to user
feedback so don't be surprised if you
see some of these implemented in the
future as for the price I feel like $79
is a lot to ask for robots see but
compared to the alternatives it's
actually still competitive the vex IQ
Hardware though is a steal at its
current price of $300 for the super kit
considering how much is included if you
buy one of these just make sure that it
gets used and appreciated this is not
the kind of thing to be assembled and
played with once and then left to
collect dust on a shelf properly
utilized this kit can and does provide
years of fun and education and that is
valuable and if you don't like robots
maybe you'll like today's video sponsor
ting because when you call ting you get
to talk to a real person and not a
machine sorry buddy ting is a mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and satisfaction first and best
of all in my opinion you only pay for
what you use which is really how all
mobile carriers should work I mean why
should anyone have to predict how much
they're going to use their phone and
then be punished for predicting wrong
that's stupid well no more the average
ting bill is only $23 a month per device
but don't take my word for it head over
to Linus ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator to see for yourself also if
you're stuck in a contract and switch
the ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 and when you
sign up at our link you'll also get $25
in service credit or $25 towards a new
device so go ahead and check it out
