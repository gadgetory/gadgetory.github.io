forever then there was the unveiling at
e3 then there were the leaked
screenshots from the reviewers deck but
finally the embargo is now up on the
fury X from AMD it's time to see what
kind of power this beautiful looking
card is packin hit that like button for
more videos featuring the fury X
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free the fury X measures in
at 7.5 inches long that's 30% smaller
than a 290x but length isn't everything
we joked about the 670 being a little
bit less endowed than its brothers back
in the day but times have changed people
are looking for lots of power in a small
package these days and the fury X is
here to give featuring a fiji core built
on a 28 nanometer process 4096 stream
processors which is twelve hundred and
eighty more than a 290x running at 1050
megahertz
256 texture unit 64 ROPS GCN 1.2 along
with 4 gigabytes of memory which is a
bit low for a card that cost six hundred
and fifty US dollars and a memory speed
of one gigabyte per second which is
really low so it has less RAM and at a
lower speed than a 390 X what the moving
on it also has a 4096 bit memory
interface woah hold on that's eight
times that of a 290x which is sitting at
512 bits that results in the fury X
having a 512 gigabyte per second memory
bandwidth compared to the 290 X's 320
gigabytes per second boom why is that
HBM our high bandwidth memory this is
AMD's bet for the future direction of
GPUs and they've been working on it for
seven years the goal is to simplify PCB
design and allow for smaller cards also
the pressure of potential stall of GPU
performance growth always hangs AMD
states that historically we solve these
problems by shrinking and integrating
functions and they would be right
looking at the direction of motherboards
and CPUs how does it work for graphics
cards from the bottom up AMD places a
package substrate an inter poser right
above that then your GPU and a few logic
dies for your memory stacked on top of
those logic dies you have your four HBM
DRAM dies moving your memory so close to
your GPU improves bandwidth per watt and
allows for as we've seen extremely wide
bus widths but
naturally this is extremely new
technology and is very expensive and
difficult to produce so you're paying an
early adopter premium speaking of which
you cannot currently overclock HBM
memory you will likely be able to in the
future but as this tech is so freakishly
new they're probably just trying to play
it safe
so that's paradigm shifting and awesome
time to take a look at the rest of the
card however for i/o it's rocking three
full-size DisplayPort 1.2 s for our easy
Eyefinity set up since AMD requires all
displays we plug into a single card and
a single HDMI 1.4 plug no HDMI 2.0 so
you're limited to 30 Hertz when running
a 4k on HDMI but like you've got three
display ports just use one of those and
for all of you screen junkies you can
hook up to six displays into this thing
as long as you spring for a DisplayPort
hub moving on to the rest of the
exterior you have a cool Radeon LED logo
on the top dual eight pin PCIe power
plugs on the right hand side which could
theoretically support 375 watts but
won't really have to is the typical load
power of this card is 275 on the left
hand side features no crossfire fingers
as AMD continues their movement of
connecting their multi card
configurations through the motherboard
on the back of the card we have a nice
full backplate which is unfortunately
interrupted by some various
identification stickers and just above
where the power connectors are we have
the GPU tach or GPU tachometer which is
AMD solution for load based LEDs and I
have to say I prefer it I hate it when
cards change RGB LEDs to signify load no
I don't want my car to change color from
white or green or red or whatever the
hell just because it went a little bit
faster but having a GPU equivalent of
the carnival game where you slam your
hammer onto a platform and the meter
goes up is totally cool with me the
front has another Radeon logo and a
really nice-looking finish where you can
get a better look at the beautiful
mixture of a mirror-like glossy black
nickel aluminum finish which I would
complain about usually but I think they
momenta dydt pretty well here and a
black soft touch rubber which feels as
good as it looks the bottom has an
expected pcie 3.0 16x
what and the rear features some tubes
and a power lead for the fan you might
also notice that it's sealed on many
cards this area would be left open to
allow for airflow but much like the IO
plate and the rest of the card for that
matter it is a sealed enclosure which is
fine because there's no internal fan
once you crack the card open you reveal
a tidy looking inside the cooler master
logo on the pump and a very clever
placement of a copper pipe in order to
cool the vrm as the liquid travels on by
leaving the card we follow a nicely
sleeved appropriate length tubing and
fan power cable set up to the radiator
which is fairly standard one by one 20
millimeter set up with about two and a
half inches of thickness we've measured
with the included fan which is
appropriate as there is a little bit of
hangover for what I believe is the
included radiator this unit also
features a pretty legendary nigh deck
gentle typhoon fan which will be running
at a more tame than usual 1500 rpm in
order to keep the noise down all in one
liquid cooling solutions on adding cards
has been a bit of a rarity but it is
definitely picking up speed it makes
sense to a lot of gamers to dedicate a
potential radiator spot to your GPU as
pushing your CPU to the limit has had
quite a reduction in impact in recent
years especially with Haswell and broad
well dropping TDPS by another 20 watts
but the additional cost of including it
from the OEM could be quite substantial
and you as the end user will have to pay
for that let me know what you guys think
in the comments down below or over on
the forum or even on twitter at luke
underscore la FR if this all sounds
great to you then you're in luck because
apparently there won't be any other
versions of it from a soos msi or
sapphire or because none of them will be
allowed to customise the card but if you
do want a different feel just wait for
the r9 fury which should be coming
around in july and will be able to be
tinkered with by the add in board
partners although it will be a bit
slower stay tuned for our video on that
card speaking of performance I don't
have as much to say as I normally do as
we were unfortunate enough to have our
fury X show up DOA with artifacting but
luckily Scott Watson from over a tech
report had our back and supplied us with
some graphs we would both really
appreciate it if you
don't his link in the video description
down below to see his rundown an
explanation of these numbers including
some more information like game settings
and system specs as far as I can glean
from these charts it's a relatively
close race but the 980ti still seems to
win quite handily and happens to be the
same price at 650 US dollars and once we
get a replacement card from AMD I'd love
to take it for a spin and overclocked
the hell out of it to see if the story
changes however if you want to see that
be sure to hit the like button down
below again in terms of power this
thing's pretty hungry
Scott's graph is under load of Crysis 3
at 4 K not peak performance and the
wattage noted here is full system usage
just so you know again the link in the
description down below for more
information in conclusion the fury
didn't exactly rip Nvidia apart and
leave them in shreds like some people
expected it's short and while we laughed
at the 670 the market has changed and I
think we're ready for that now due to
ITX motherboards and little tiny systems
becoming the norm and them wanting short
little graphics cards that just move the
cooling to a single rad instead and that
could be kind of cool for a lot of
people GC n 1.2 means better DirectX 12
support with an older generation AMD or
older nth generation Nvidia cards and
HBM is finally here albeit a little
lower of a capacity than we may have
expected alright guys I have something a
little different for you now instead of
a traditional ad spot for cable mod we
wanted to spice things up and do a build
log of sorts of their new customisable
mod flex sleeved wires check it out I'm
starting with this actually which is
already done and so this is what your
cable mod reflects sleeved wires will
actually turn into if you want to do it
in this way and then I will be doing
silver and orange for the next one so
while you just check out these cables
going to read off some facts about the
mod flex wires they got a whole bunch of
different character types 24 pin 8 2 X 8
pin EPS 4 pin ATX 6 pin PCI e and 8 pin
PCIe in colors of blue green black light
blue light green orange purple red
silver white and yellow and the lengths
of the cables will be 20 centimeters 40
centimeters and 60 centimeters so like I
said the idea
is just kind of making your own cables
so your connector will have a white
dotted side and a side that has nothing
on it that means that the white tips of
these cables have to go into the end
with the white dot and then I have to
pull these white ends off so what I do
is just use three of my fingers to kind
of get all the way around it
shimmy it down a little bit just so it
gets over the metal piece then I can
grab on the end and just pull it off and
just start putting things in boom and
done orange now moving on to the gray
one we do pretty much the same thing all
right so now we just go in the other
holes and it looks really good
so that was the white end so what I can
just do is plug this guy in there we go
now this is the black end first thing
that we actually need to do is get all
these black tips off the end just let's
do that really quickly so now come
around and just near the other side
there we go you have yourself a nice and
fancy in this case either silver and
orange or black and green cable whoa my
shirts changed anyways guys I hope you
liked the mod flex DIY extension cables
from cable mod little weird bill blog II
kinda thing I don't really know what to
call it it's an interesting form of an
integration I think it's pretty cool
that you can make basically whatever
color combination you want very easily
making your own cables can be super
annoying so now you can make cool like
multicolored cables all on your own
within minutes
