5 I apologize for the fact that I'm
wearing a headset here I'm actually
streaming this concurrently on twitch TV
and so if you guys aren't already
subscribed to me on twitch TV it's
twitch.tv slash Linus tech this is the
iPhone 5 of one of camera man's friends
this chair and we're gonna unbox it I
know everyone in their dog has already
done an iPhone 5 unboxing but I don't
care because I haven't done one yet and
I haven't seen one yet so we are going
to have the unboxing experience the
unbox the unbox the box is quite similar
to the iPhone 4 in that it contains an
iPhone that is really light actually oh
that makes a big difference ok but we're
not gonna oh no no we're not gonna look
at the phone just yet we're gonna do my
usual thing where we actually make you
guys fit through the accessories before
we before we actually fully actually
open the phone so Bonjour would be an
indication that you bought your phone in
Canada hello and there's my cat knocking
things over which he shouldn't do ok
more accessories inside here so we've
got a lightning cable which is different
from a Thunderbolt cable completely
different by the way so the cable no
longer cares how it's plugged in you can
actually plug it into your iPhone 5 this
way or this way totally doesn't matter I
would have loved to see Apple release
something that would be like a
thunderbolt compatible connector or
perhaps USB 3 compliant but you can tell
from the only four pins inside here that
this is not indeed USB 3 compliant in
any way shape or form this is just a USB
2 cable that has been redesigned for no
apparent reason we've got a very similar
wall plug to what we got with the with
the iPhone 4 what I got with my iPhone 4
and we have apples all new earbuds
so let's go ahead and go back to
remember what page we were on before but
Apple is making a pretty big fuss about
these new redesigned earbuds from the
sound up apparently the concept at Apple
if I could find a way to open the
package here so the concept at Apple was
by by blocking more of the earbud you
could direct the sound more to put that
to drivers in there I actually haven't
done any research on these whatsoever so
there's an included microphone as we've
come to expect from anything included
with a phone you've also got your
built-in volume control and yeah
completely so there's two ports on these
the ports are actually so this will go
into your left ear so that'll fire right
into your ear canal and then there's
also a port kind of on the outside that
may give them sort of a richer fuller
sound but having not tried them yet all
I can do is sort of point at them and
point at them in Latin feet of Nelson
style now let's get to the iPhone 5
itself and this is gonna be so funny if
you guys do watch the show regularly is
we're gonna do an iPhone 4 size
comparison so you can actually see the
iPhone 5 is more like the thickness of
the internal part of an iPhone 4 without
the glass pieces on the outside the lip
is identical so you can't even see the
iPhone 5 behind the iPhone 4 alright and
then the height as you can again see is
longer so the iPhone 5 has a 4-inch
display this is a retina retina class
display it's 11 something by something
you know what I really haven't I really
haven't done much prep for this I'm not
really much of an Apple guy so you guys
will have to just forgive me for this
hold on hold on let's look it up we'll
just look it up because that's what
that's what that's the professional
thing to do comes with an 8 megapixel
camera oh this is cool too so the front
camera is now 720p which means you can
FaceTime in HD if you actually use
FaceTime
I used FaceTime about a half a dozen
times when I first got an iPhone 4 and
since then I haven't touched
I mean you know what you guys I would
love for you to leave a comment under
the video if you actually use FaceTime
or some kind of other equivalent voice
chat because I love it 11:36 by 6:40 so
that is an enormous resolution for the
phone itself let's get some close-ups as
if you guys oh look at that there's a
scratch of it
see that Oh Oh camera man's friend might
think that was us but we have we have
filmed documentation that it wasn't us
it was already there when we peeled off
the protective sticker so hmm that's
sort of disappointing I'm sorry camera
man's friend that you're going to have
to endure that let's go ahead and fire
this fire this bad boy up so we'll get
some shots of the it's actually very
beautiful I mean apples so good at this
they've gone instead of a silver a
silver aluminum and I'm sorry you twitch
guys aren't gonna be able to see this or
whatever but instead of a silver side
they've gone with a black and dark like
a gunmetal looking side so our speakers
are still on the bottom our headphone
jack is now on the bottom which is
actually kind of convenient for me so
think about this from an ergonomics
standpoint guys I'm holding my phone I'm
using it I'm setting up my playlist and
then I'm gonna put it in my pocket I'm
gonna want to put it in my pocket this
way as opposed to this way so this is
kind of smart I often ride my bike and I
listen to music while I'm riding my bike
so I often set a price our price list us
playlists and then put my phone in my
pocket so I think that's kind of smart
okay there's our lightning connector
there on the bottom as well and we've
got our ha that's where our stem cards
gonna go that's where our power button
is Apple really hasn't changed the power
button layout in quite some time
there's our LED flash on the back of the
unit as well as that 8 megapixel camera
that does have new modes in addition to
being a megapixel so you can now take
panoramic shots just by like moving it
around like this which is sort of neat
you got your usual mute button on the
side here as well as your volume
switches so yeah they just really
haven't changed anything about the about
the input you know what you know what
we're gonna be okay okay we're gonna be
the first ones on me
turn it to show a cat operating an
iPhone 5 so let's see if I can get my
cat to unlock the screen rumble can you
unlock the screen for me it seems it'll
work there we go did you get that
cameraman you didn't get that okay here
well he's gonna click the button that
says no sim card installed me got this
and and there we go what a good boy next
let's pick a country he's purring some
cute dick Canada oh no no Canada there
you go you know where you live
good job sweetheart let's put the cat
down again okay so let's go through some
of the other stuff so Retina display
probably an outstanding display although
I obviously haven't looked at it yet
based on my previous experience wow it's
light the same kind of responsiveness
again you've come to expect from from
Apple the lightness really does make a
big difference people kind of our joking
about the longer screen and I personally
don't really think it's that funny I
think it's outstanding because it's
going to be better for watching videos
it's also going to allow you to continue
to type to touch type with one hand
which I cannot personally do on a galaxy
s3 you're gonna have to give us a minute
to throw in a SIM card and we'll be
right back and I managed to not know
that the iPhone 5 for its you know LTE
network connectivity and whatever else
it needs it for uses Micro SIM which
means I can't just pop my sim card in
there and that's quite unfortunate
however we can do a quick overview of
the rest of the features if you guys
aren't already familiar with them and
can we is there anything else
iOS 6 doesn't even care about iOS 6 at
this point I mean that Maps app is like
the butt of every joke that I have
encountered on the Internet in the last
little while that isn't gun yum style or
however you say that so yeah I don't
know if anyone cares about that all the
new a6 chip so you're still getting
great battery life out of it I mean even
now two plus years and owning my iPhone
4 I still get reasonable battery life
out of
so a six gives you up to two times the
power of the CPU and two times the power
of the GPU that we found in the 4s but
while still maintaining excellent
battery life so that's encouraging as
well okay not only bother late it's okay
I think that's pretty much it it's
thinner it's like it really is later
Wow that makes such a big difference I
thought I didn't really like the new ID
based on pictures and whatnot but now
that I'm seeing it in person I'm
actually kind of sold because I always
really liked the feel and the heft of
the two glass pieces on the iPhone 4 but
yeah I could be convinced to use an
iPhone 5 especially with the wide screen
for you know using air video or whatever
else to watch well videos and just yeah
the fact that it's so late so thank you
for checking out my horrible horrible
unboxing of the iPhone 5 don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
yes mostly computer videos not so much
not so much iPhone videos but who knows
maybe we'll get into it later better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
