asking to sponsor a piece on the
technology they're building into their
cruise liners my initial reaction was
like what am I gonna say about
navigation systems then I looked at the
list of high-tech ship features that
they were going to be showing off
hydrogen fuel cell power systems facial
recognition and Mark Asian VR dessert
bar wait what and then I promptly
boarded a plane for New York
okay so some of the text they covered in
the keynote did actually end up being
ship stuff like how they're using
augmented reality to overlay navigation
information during adverse weather
conditions and how by using computer
modeling to change the hull shape they
were able to reduce drag through the
water by about 5 percent improving the
ship's fuel economy and reducing its
environmental impact then they moved
into the open source platform that Royal
Caribbean is contributing to that's
designed for much faster innovation in
the industry as a whole now on the
surface this future app that's part of
it has the ability to see and book
cruises view a map of the ship and book
excursions and activities which is
pretty standard hey we've got an app
fair but if you dig a little deeper you
honor them incredible functionality a
digital concierge will understand and
answer common questions guests to guests
shipwide messaging is built-in so you
can avoid incurring SMS roaming charges
and to help coordinate meetups and
scheduling shipwide multi deck location
tracking makes it simple to see like
where the kids are hanging out or if the
reason that you can't find each other is
that you're actually at the same end of
the ship but on different decks and then
comes the really next-level stuff
Royal Caribbean will be using machine
learning to look at factors like your
past preferences demographics your
travel companions and your schedule to
recommend activities during time slots
when you're available so if you're
dining with the inlaws it might suggest
a nice red wine pairing rather than a
vodka soda and the central component of
this more open ecosystem is the bring
your own device concept so no more
clunky NFC bracelets just install the
app snap a selfie scan your luggage when
you embark and you walk on board the
facial recognition cameras will
authenticate you based on the picture
that you just took which brings us to
the deck of the ship complete with
clouds that actually ended up looking
more like giant sheep suspended from
wires but uh a +4 effort you guys and
where we get to the real reason that I
would be willing to allow an app to know
where I am on the ship at all times
now they're still evaluating different
technologies for how to do it most
reliably but the demo that they did
tonight here allowed me to just fire up
the app click a drink monitor the
real-time status like what then about a
minute later someone shows up hands me
the drink and takes off if that is not
the future of pampering I don't know
what is and augmented reality was
another big talking point here as I
mentioned before it's already in use for
navigation but it's also got some more
entertaining uses so guests waiting to
embark can play augmented reality games
and on the deck you'll actually be able
to point your phone at these kinds of
picture frames and they'll give you an
x-ray vision like experience into the
real time inner workings of the ship
with live views available of places like
the galley where the food's being
prepared the bridge the engine room and
more now not everything they demoed here
necessarily has a firm rollout time but
there were some other really cool
concept level things with virtual dining
as the standout for me using HTC vibes
with front-facing cameras for hand
presence they had us try three different
food morsels in front of us that were
also being tracked by the cameras so the
VR dining experience would actually know
what you're eating and then adjust the
visuals to match now obviously it's
pretty first gen right now but I can
imagine that as VR headsets get lighter
and less clunky taking a bite of ice
cream for instance and watching snow
begin to fall or biting into something
spicy and being transported to a
scorching desert would be pretty cool
obviously I wouldn't eat three meals a
day like that but as an experience it
was utterly unique
and everyone walking out thought it was
a ton of fun next we wrote the automated
shuttle so cool this was actually my
first time in a fully driverless vehicle
and headed into the future stateroom
showcase so rooms like this will be
rolling out over the next year as you
walk in the room welcomes you opening
the curtains and setting the mood with
some lights even displaying a message on
screen if you're let's say celebrating a
special occasion with your cruise and
then everything in here including the
air conditioning can be controlled via
the built-in touch controls through your
phone from anywhere on the ship or good
night in the case of certain functions
like scene lighting with your voice a
standout feature for me was the support
though for both chromecast and Apple TV
because I am exactly the kind of person
who would want to bring my own content
with me on a trip that's fantastic
the stateroom concept room took mood
lighting one step further with displays
built into or projected onto the ceiling
and the floor allowing you to go to
sleep to the sights and sounds of a
clear starry sky or a tropical storm if
that suits your fancy although we don't
have an ETA for those to be rolled out
after that we rode the shuttle one more
time arriving at the hydrogen fuel cell
power unit from Ballard
that it turns out was actually using the
150 kilogram hydrogen storage trailer in
the parking lot to run many of the demos
we saw today including the Robo screens
and the immersion tunnel so the box on
top here is about one-third fuel cell
stack along with some accompanying
components like the safety mechanism and
fuel delivery system and a humidifier
that actually recirculates some of the
waste moisture to keep the whole unit
operating at an optimal humidity level
then down below we get a filtered air
intake a compressor that's actually an
automotive supercharger that's been
modified by the manufacturer for peak
reliability the cooling system which
captures the heat from the exothermic
fuel cell reaction and would normally
use seawater in this heat
changer to dissipate it along with a
waste reservoir that ends up collecting
pure water that on a ship then could be
added to the drinking water supply
saving energy for the high powered
desalination units that cruise ships
normally rely on entirely so thanks to
Royal Caribbean for bringing us out to
New York to cover this cool event and
thanks to you guys for watching this
video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
the like button check out the link that
we'll have to Royal Caribbean in the
video description and while you're down
there maybe check out our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one as
well as our community forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
