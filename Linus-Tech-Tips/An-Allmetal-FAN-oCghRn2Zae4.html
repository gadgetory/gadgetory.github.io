a CPU cooler you take a big old hunk of
metal you take a plastic fan and you
slap it on there in hopes that the
raging inferno of a Pentium D processor
you've got will stay alive long enough
to become a weird curiosity for the
employees you hire 10 years down the
line who were it's still in diapers when
you started building computers but not
thermaltake now thermaltake took a metal
heatsink okay I'm with you so far
slapped a metal fan onto it because Yolo
in an attempt to cool down a modern CPU
in one of the smallest form factor
coolers that I've ever seen but does it
work
so if you were just here to find out if
a metal fan would work then you'll be
sorely disappointed because I'm also
going to bore you with some science and
history the sandia cooler concept with
its metal spinning top and static metal
base first showed up on the scene in
2012 with this video gaining
considerable attention among PC
enthusiasts due to its promises of
vastly improved efficiency smaller size
and quieter operation compared to more
traditional heatsink designs then there
was no news until Coolermaster showed up
at CES 2015 with a couple kind of ugly
prototypes that featured grooves between
the spinning top and the base presumably
to improve heat transfer and an outer
heatsink to further improve cooling
performance fast-forward to today and
this tech is finally on the market the
fundamental idea here is pretty simple
theoretically when the air gap between
the fixed grooved metal base and the
spinning grooved metal impeller is small
enough heat transfer can still occur as
though they were connected in practice
this was pretty difficult to pull off
but through a combination of patience
and apparently balancing the impeller
like the wheel on a car Thermaltake was
the first one to do it to test how
effective the engine 27 was we gathered
up a bunch of other small form-factor
coolers from reputable brands and a
stock Intel heatsink since if it doesn't
offer a compelling improvement over that
you're clearly better off saving your
money we used an asus z170 AI pro gaming
motherboard thanks bros and a core i7
6700 K with an NZXT grid 2.0 for fan
control for each test we used a
pea-sized amount of IC diamond thermal
compound and we analyzed the results two
different ways first we looked at what
we could expect
from each cooler out of the box using
the silent mode curve in NZXT scam
software the engine 27 was the
worst-performing cooler in this test at
about 10 degrees higher than the nearest
aftermarket competitor under load and
all of this while managing to be louder
than the Intel Box cooler as measured by
our X Tech 407 750 digital sound level
meter the second method of analysis was
to introduce a noise ceiling limiting
the maximum rpm of each cooler to the
speed at which it reaches 45 decibels
the same as the stock cooler so
performing worse than the stock cooler
or thermal throttling would result in a
fail grade for this test all of them
passed but CPU cooling isn't the be-all
and end-all and maintaining enough
airflow to the component nearby is of
critical importance the good news is
that all of our coolers performed
similarly with the c7 only pulling ahead
when we allowed it to get a little noisy
leading us finally to the reason
presumably that thermal takes engineers
thought the engine 27 deserved to exist
its size it's not the top performer in
any category but this one at a full
centimeter shorter than the nearest
competitor from Noctua and less than
half the height of the top performing
aro 6 from silverstone the engine 27 is
compatible with any case that's wide
enough to fit a memory stick
so with form factor as a consideration
I'll be giving a few awards here today
the aro 6 gets my big and beautiful
award for being the best performer if a
little top-heavy the Noctua NHL 9i takes
home the middle child award for being so
ugly only its own mother could love it
but otherwise a solid compact choice and
the Thermaltake Engine 27 gets my better
than nothing award for working better
than I expected given its size making it
a great option if you don't have
anything else
it will fit so congrats to the winners
thanks for watching and good night and
I've got another award this time for one
of our lucky viewers we are hooking one
of you up with the SSD to go pkt
from angel bird they set us up with
these bad boys for CES 2017 you can
check them out in our gear bag video
over here and they gave us an extra one
with a silk-screened LTT superfan like
logo fing on and everything it's a 256
gig portable SSD drive it's super tiny
it's USB 3.1 with either a Type A or a
Type C connection to your computer and
it can handle up to 560 megabyte per
second transfer speeds so all you got to
do to enter to win is check out the link
in the video description so thanks again
for watching guys if you dislike dislike
if you like then like if you really
liked then maybe check out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link to
Amazon in the video description you can
also join our community forum and I'm
pretty sure there's something else down
there right cool t-shirts like the one
that I am wearing I think that's pretty
much it
subscribe blah blah blah blah right
check out our other videos like that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
