like the same product that I unboxed
before the XL 24-20 T from Ben Q with
Keaton and spawn featured on the cover
but this one is slightly more different
in a way that is actually kind of too so
this guy is the 24 20 TX which is
basically very similar to the 24 20 t
it's the same basic monitor except for a
couple things one is it includes Nvidia
3d vision glasses version 2 we got all
our included cables power DVI VGA you've
got a Quick Start Guide ok so this is
all pretty much par for the course at
this point we have our base station so
this is a 120 Hertz LCD not only is it
120 Hertz but it also has the firmware
that supports Nvidia light boost here's
a little sleeve for your glasses to keep
them in as well as a 3d vision kickstart
guide
don't forget guys for 3d vision you will
need and in a supported Nvidia graphics
card although this kit means that you'll
have the correct monitor as well as the
correct glasses at the very least next
we've got this is for navigating your
monitors on-screen menu as well as for
changing between different profiles that
you might prefer from different games or
different genres of games this is a dust
cover which is the most like strange
thing because this one and the regular
24 20 T are like the only monitors
produced in the last 10 years probably
that come with a dust cover
don't figure right and the next we have
the stands so this has its red accents
it clips into here just like this oh no
not like that looks in somewhere like
something that's for sure that must be
it yeah you can see you can actually
tell from the arrows that are lined up
on the bottom here a little arrow there
and that is how we know that it is in
the right place so next we take out the
packing foam and extract the monitor
itself where which is where we're going
to find the next cool things about this
particular screen if you guys remember
from my unboxing of a Seuss's 3d vision
to monitor the there we go there's has a
built-in transmitter that allows you to
run 3d vision without that little ah
sorry guys it's hard to like construct
things and talk at the same time
actually so I'm just gonna finish
building the monitor and then I'll talk
there we go so the asu's model has a
built-in transmitter so you don't have
to use that little pyramid ii thing in
order to use 3d vision this guy has it
as well although i'd say it's actually
even more elegantly implemented so let's
go around to the front of the monitor
okay fine we'll start here so cameraman
wants to see all the adjustments we can
make so we've got our pivot so try not
Ted sort of cleaned it with the monitor
here okay we've got our height
adjustable all right it goes one way and
oh yeah this guy tilt there you go so
you got pretty much everything just good
because it's a fairly expensive monitor
all things considered let's go here
there we are
here we find a USB hub we find USB in we
find two HDMI inputs DVI in that's dual
link DVI because 120 Hertz monitors do
require greater data
then not 120 Hertz monitors at 1080p VGA
as well as DisplayPort so it should be
noted also about this monitor that it
supports 3d over HDMI so if you have a
Playstation 3 or a 3d ready blu-ray
player oh yeah that's one of the other
features this one has that the 2420 does
not this guy supports 3d over HDMI so
whatever kind of 3d output device you
put it to this display and you are ready
to rock so there is our transmitter so
very very elegantly saluted it's got
elegantly implemented little tiny
infrared transmitter right on the front
of the monitor there very innocuous next
and it's beside the touch sensitive
buttons although honestly on this
monitor I won't really use that because
you just plug this guy into the little
USB port on this side over here which
you guys saw at the bottom and that is
what you can use to control your
on-screen display you scroll through
things like that you press the buttons
in order to navigate so that's kind of
cool as well I think that covers it
except for on this side there we go two
more USB ports as well as a headphone
jack so that's only useful if you're
transmitting audio via HDMI so there you
go
you can pass that through to your
headphones right which sit on these
stand at the back here in fact we have
some SteelSeries headphones right here
so we can show you how that works
looks just like that pretty cool right I
think that pretty much covers it so it's
a 1080p 3d vision - ready monitor that
is also compatible with other 3d devices
like your blu-ray player or whatever
else and it is light boost ready they
already say light boost something a
couple times whatever it slight boost
ready comes with the 3d vision two
glasses comes with the integrated
transmitter and is otherwise pretty much
the same as the 2420 t so thank you for
checking out this unboxing of the 2420
TX for you RC geeks out there you might
know that TX is also short for
transmitter and don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos
cameraman who's filling in for slick
today insisted that I demo the monitor
with the dust cover
there's also something I missed it took
cameraman to notice this you see these
grooves on the outside of the little
control module check this out
it is magnetic and it sticks right there
and you can actually put it on either
side of the monitor so it's a lot more
aesthetically pleasing when you do it
that way then when you just have it kind
of laying there on the desk so now I
think we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
