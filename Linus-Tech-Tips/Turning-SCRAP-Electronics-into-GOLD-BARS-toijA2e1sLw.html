manufacturing in Asia understandably
there are a lot of words that probably
pop into your mind toxic chemicals air
pollution hazardous waste a weight heavy
metals and you know what these are real
problems that anyone with half a brain
can hopefully agree that we need to
solve so then what is being done on the
small island nation of Taiwan where
according to the Economist 40% of their
annual exports our electronic devices
manufactured by companies like a new HTC
and Acer to find out we went about an
hour out of the city to sit down and
chat with mr. Stan sue the president of
Sue's recycling Technology Inc Ambaji
$100 chip these are some coupons on the
web why Putin creation why she went
Jimmy's very quiet open towards a change
all so for example
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below in circuit board
manufacturing as in baking there is
always some leftover material when the
finished product is cut out but unlike
baking you can't just fold it up and cut
again so what do you do to answer that
SRT I was kind enough to take us deep
inside the bowels of one of their four
facilities here in Cali n Taiwan where
they're using techniques created in
collaboration with several universities
under the supervision of the
Environmental Protection Bureau to
extract valuable metals like gold silver
and platinum from leftovers so they can
be reused instead of ending up in a
landfill or a pile in a developing
country somewhere and the goal is to do
this in the most ecologically
responsible way possible so some of the
e-waste coming in the door takes a
pretty familiar form printed circuit
boards integrated circuits and the like
these get picked up from partners
shredded right in front of the partners
to protect their valuable intellectual
property and then the shreds get placed
into these stainless steel cages they
are round so that they can be spun
around like a clothes dryer to optimize
contact with the solvent that you have
got to be kidding me cyanide I
immediately I was like is that safe and
they were like of course not what a
stupid question that's why we have these
gas detectors fume hoods and goofy
clothes so anyway the crane grabs the
cage and submerges it in the cyanide
spins it around and then as little as
three to four minutes later depending on
the elements in the waste it can be
pulled out washed cooled dried and then
open to reveal some scraps from LED
production so what you see here is a
stripped
old copper alloy any exposed gold has
actually been dissolved into the cyanide
so it gets put into these one-ton drums
for further processing but we'll come
back to that a little bit later first we
need to take a look at some of the
e-waste that you might not recognize as
potentially valuable these bags are full
of cloths that were used to clean
electronic parts during manufacturing so
they pick up trace amounts of valuable
metals like aluminum silver and maybe
even gold that can be extracted by the
coolest means possible with fire but
burning these cloths normally would
release toxic and environmentally
harmful chemicals called dioxins so
that's where the furnace as it's been
nicknamed comes in unlike some crude
burn barrel it uses two combustion
chambers a primary one to burn down the
fabric and melt metals like silver and a
secondary chamber that takes the exhaust
and turns it up to around a thousand
degrees Celsius to destroy the dioxins
then rapidly drops the temperature down
to 200 degrees Celsius to prevent them
from reforming this process can yield as
much as a kilogram of silver per hundred
kilograms of cloth and a lot of ash that
can actually be used for concrete
production the remnants from the burning
process come with us to the next station
they're heated up in a titanium
container in a King's water bath this
mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid
dissolves gold and platinum but not the
other so-called noble metals then
anything that we don't need gets
filtered out here before the yellow
liquid is carted over to the next
station electrolysis they are used to
extract the gold from both our Kings
water and cyanide solutions from before
the negative terminal is on the left and
the positive is on the right with a
stirring motor in the middle
the terminals will collect other things
while the gold in a porous form called
sponge gold collects in a titanium
container this process continues for 24
hours and the voltages applied to
extract this purity of gold are
apparently trade secrets that they
wouldn't allow us to show once all the
gold is extracted the liquid gets
transferred to another facility where
they're focused on taking out silver
leading us then finally to where the
magic really happens the casting room
our sponge gold is heated to over a
thousand degrees the vapours you see
being captured by the fume hood are
small acid impurities then some regular
household borax is added to act as a
flux and purifying agent and the gold
gets poured into a cat
yes my friends you are witnessing the
birth of a gold brick the cast gets
poured into water to cool and harden it
then it's actually still pretty warm
when it comes out our 4:00 to 5:00 9:00
fine grade two kilogram gold brick is
ready for polishing and transfer to the
vault which they unfortunately wouldn't
let us inside so I don't even know how
much what's two kilos or gold worth so
how much is this one worth Oh like a
hundred thousand Canadian or so no no
not so much
so each month then 130 people working at
SRT I turn about 200 metric tons of what
would otherwise be a waste into a
hundred kilograms of gold 800 to 900
kilograms of silver and about a metric
ton of copper unbelievable a huge shout
out to them for allowing us behind the
scenes to see how they've built an
amazing business out of reusing and
recycling precious materials while
minimizing the environmental impact of
the electronics manufacturing taking
place on their Island home
you've probably heard maybe even on this
show that browsing the internet with a
VPN is safer and more secure but if it
looks complicated
never fear tunnel there has got you
covered tunnel bear is a simple download
and then basically one button you press
the button and boom your connection gets
encrypted keeping your Internet traffic
private from advertisers and even your
internet service provider and you appear
as though you are browsing the Internet
and use
online services as though you are in a
different country so I'm not going to
call it anything specific but let's say
you know some some broadcasting
corporation that's only free within
certain borders sorry I had something in
my eye there tunnel bear has a top-rated
privacy policy and does not log your
activity so try it for free with 500
megabytes of data included a no credit
card required then when you get a year
of unlimited data don't forget to use
our offer code you can save 10% at
tunnel bear comm slash LTT so thanks for
watching guys if you just like this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed and maybe leave a comment
letting us know if you want to see more
of these types of on location tech
