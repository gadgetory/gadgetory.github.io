the m500 SSD from crucial now this one's
gonna be pretty short because it's
another SSD so there's not a whole lot
to say about it with respect to like wow
that's great cable management and you
know the widgets are optimized for the
whatever also basically this is using
microns latest 20 nanometer flash so if
you guys don't know this already micron
is crucial parent company it comes with
a three year warranty this is the first
major iteration that they've made to
their SSD lineup since the m4 on the
consumer side anyway so the m4 has been
an awesome SSD part of what gives me a
lot of confidence recommending crucial
SSDs is the fact that the m4 was so well
supported they found firmware bugs
before it ever actually became a problem
with people with people's drives that
were actually deployed in the field so
there was one where the drive would just
stop working after X number of hours
their lab was still working on QA and
testing and found it before it ever
became a problem so that kind of stuff
is really really really good to see the
drive itself is slim so it'll fit in a
seven millimeter two and a half inch
enclosure or it comes with a spacer on
it so you can go ahead and add an extra
two millimeters to it so it'll fit in a
standard nine millimeter spot I guess
you put that on the bottom or the top
birds up to you I don't really know oh
yeah you put that on on here on the top
you got a simple label here you've got
some mounting holes you've got there
like super like 80s looking packaging I
really liked the old packaging for their
drives better than this ah this is cool
so they've added a couple things though
they divided hardware data encryption
which is becoming a more important
feature basically what that does is it's
a BIOS level lock so you have to enter a
password just to boot up the computer
and have access to the drive that just
keeps your data more safe adaptive
thermal protection has also been added
it so I've got a three year warranty
still the thing about crew about crucial
drives is that unlike sand force based
drives which I mean Intel's using lots
of companies are using it is not
dependent on the data being compressible
so you're able to do up to 500 megabytes
per second reads 400 megabytes per
second writes and that is regardless of
the type of data and this particular
drive is good for up to about 80,000
on the high end of the capacity so as
drives scaling capacity the performance
does tend to go up and that is one of
the things that's most exceptional about
the m500 it is available in a 960 gig
capacity for a price of around 600
dollars making it the most reasonably
priced terabyte class drive available
now this one right here is 128 gigs so
you can get 128 256 512 or this 960
sorry was it 1 sorry 120 240 brainfart
there 240 times 2 is 480 alternately I
could have done 960 divided by 2 is 480
so 480 or 960 gigs now the pricing
scales in sort of a weird fashion with I
mean in the past it used to be that the
high-capacity drives carried a price
premium in terms of dollars per gig over
the lower-end ones but with the m500 it
actually scales downwards in terms of
price per gig as you go to a greater
capacity so you can see what crucial is
doing here is they're really pushing the
add up adoption of SSDs as a
high-capacity storage which is extremely
exciting so there you go guys if you
wanted to drop 600 bucks on an SSD
tomorrow it would be pretty hard for me
to not recommend the one terabyte m500
you can actually store all your data on
it don't forget to subscribe for this
