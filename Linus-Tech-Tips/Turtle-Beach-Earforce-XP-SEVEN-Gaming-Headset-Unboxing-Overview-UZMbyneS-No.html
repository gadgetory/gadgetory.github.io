- drive air AE 400 welcome to my
unboxing of the console headset
explosion here this is the ear force XP
7 from turtlebeach which is going to be
very similar to the ear force z7 which
would be the PC variant that doesn't
include the console interface right here
so why don't we start with what's
actually included in the Box since it's
all conveniently spread out and all over
the place here so number one is you get
the headset itself it's a little bit on
the heavy side but of course that makes
it feel more quality it's just whether
or not that's worth it to you when you
have it sitting on your head it's
totally up to you it's not super heavy
or anything like that though next up
you've got the adapter from their
multi-pin connector here so there's our
like a breakaway connector that has a
convenient line so you don't plug it in
and correctly - a simple 4 pole
three-and-a-half millimeter jack alright
next
you've got the control unit ok so this
guy right here is where the magic
happens because this headset is more
than just an analogue headset I love
that you have the option to use it
analog but they've got a fully
programmable DSP that is right in here
so that's a digital sound processor and
there's a whole bunch of cool stuff you
can do with that more on that later that
comes with a nice long cable and comes
with a nice long extension cable so the
idea is that that control pod should be
able to sit next to you while you're
gaming even if your console is sort of
across the across the room and you're
sitting on your couch or whatever else
so they're extension cable goes there
next up we have power for the console
interface here so that's just a simple
USB connector and then that'll plug into
this control pod right here alright the
next cable we've got is the mobile cable
which actually looks pretty similar to
the regular headset cable however what
it does is it is wired so that you're
not going to have microphones
interfering with each other and all that
kind of stuff if you want to take a call
or whatever else so it is clearly
labeled it has a little button on it so
that you can take calls
see that and it's also a different size
so you can see that the the actual piece
here is quite different okay and then
between those two things hopefully you
can figure out which is which when
you're trying to set things up all right
next up we've got their microphone which
is actually it looks pretty excellent so
it's got a nice little pop filtering
sort of wind reduction foam on it then
it has one of the most adjustable and
staying where you put it a bull snakes
on it that I have ever actually
encountered it plugs into the headset
just like this so that you don't have to
have it on but you do have the option
should you so desire now it should also
be noted that there is a microphone port
built into the headphone one or the two
the mobile one as well so there you have
it
alright finally you've got an auxiliary
connector so you can use this to plug
into something like an mp3 player or
whatever else if you want to mix your
audio into your game track cool a
Toslink optical digital cable as well as
an Xbox 360 chat cable and that is all
the cables that are included you have
all the cables you need which is great
because the headset has a lot of really
cool functionality so let's get into the
control pod here which okay fine no no
what let's let's do the headphones or
the headset itself first so there's it's
got some pretty good clamping force here
and actually the foam while very squishy
is is is a bit of a slow coming back one
like a slow bouncing one so I suspect
that that when you first put these on
they might not feel that comfortable I'm
finding them a little bit tight but once
they break in I would expect them to be
quite comfy like I said before they are
a little bit on the heavy side but at
least they do feel very quality about it
they're not just unnecessarily heavy now
I did find that the headband has a bit
of a metal piece here that I was able to
feel it does make it quite strong
obviously but I was able to feel that on
my head
slick didn't have that problem and I
mean if you kind of loosen it a little
bit you might not have that problem as
well but it's just something that I
observed about the headset you can
replace the shields on the side which is
kind of cool so you can put like
different ones on there if you want they
just attach with little
this is right there so they snap into
place I believe they've got a whole
bunch of different stuff I mean what I
would probably do with something like
this is like paint it myself or
something cool like that in fact you
could even just leave them open if you
wanted that looks kind of neat as well
all right adjustable adjustability not
the most adjustable headphones I've ever
encountered but not bad either so you
see if I'm wearing these they sit it's
quite quite high above my head and if I
bring them all the way down to the very
bottom they are a little bit too a
little bit too small for me so I use
that I wear a medium size motorcycle
helmet so there you go that should give
you guys some idea what's up the earpads
our takeoff of all cleanable replaceable
whatever you could want to do with them
this comes off quite easily and quite
nicely so let's switch over to the other
side and show you guys I yes here you go
so they are very rotatable very
adjustable they should sit on your head
correctly pretty much no matter what
kind of a shape you have to it now the
microphone plugs in here you can see
there's actually a little alignment dots
right there so you can make sure you get
that right if you happen to be looking
at it while you're while you're doing
that okay so you can see that there's
also a guide right there so you don't
accidentally put it in the wrong way
this is actually important because of
just how this is intended to sit in
front of your mouth because it doesn't
really Bend this way quite as well kind
of bends whichever way you want but the
orientation of the mic is right there so
you don't want to be talking into the
wrong side of the microphone now the
headset does have 50 millimeter drivers
however there's more two headphone
quality than the size of the speakers
inside I hope you guys know that but
with that said a cursory evaluation just
very very quickly does tell me that
these are not your typical gaming
headphones where it's just all marketing
fluff and no sound quality whatsoever
and they happen to have a microphone on
them that is not the case I haven't
thoroughly edition' them or anything
like that but at least you know for
spending a couple hundred dollars plus
on something you're not just getting
something that you could have gotten for
20 bucks or you know similar but this my
friends is where the magic really
happens this is the USB control module
and it does a number of different things
so you can plug your headset your Xbox
communication connector over there as
well as your mobile phone or your mp3
player or whatever else and this allows
you to do a bunch of really cool stuff
so number one is you can do voice effect
so you can change the timbre of your
voice very very cool stuff number two is
you can change the audio quality effect
so you can actually change your
equalizer settings you can set up
different profiles for different games
and select between them you can download
profiles from turtlebeach that they've
created or user created profiles but I
didn't even gets more interesting if you
have your phone plugged in as an mp3
player while you're gaming you get a
call you can actually go okay this
little dial right here
turn that up and you can continue your
phone call without actually even
interrupting your game which is both
really cool and a little bit sad on the
left side you've actually got a dial
that you can use to monitor your own
audio input so you can make sure that
people can hear you okay and all that
good stuff
power on the right you've got your chat
volume which you can control separately
from gain volume as well as a mode
control buttons this is your main volume
dial switch right up here in the middle
you've also got microphone mute
adjustments for the locations of your
speakers so because it does support
Dolby Digital you can not only listen
and surround but you can also kind of
adjust speaker positions virtually on
the fly you can switch it to 5.1 you can
turn surround on and off with sort of
the buttons I guess the buttons over on
this side there's a dedicated bilby
Digital button right there and of course
it works on PC Mac game consoles pretty
much anything you could possibly want
and the last one that I personally think
is really cool is their dynamic chat
boost so what that does is because all
the sounds are going through the digital
sound processor here and while being
processed it can do cool things like you
can say okay there's an explosion in the
game well you don't want that to
necessarily drown out your bros who are
trying to communicate with you so it can
dynamically adjust chat volume to make
sure that you can hear it above the
volume of the game itself so I'm gonna
put these on in spite of the fact that
one of the ear pads is missing let me
tell you it is not comfortable to wear
like this but thank you for checking out

video leave a dislike if you disliked
the video and leave a comment if you
think that this thing comes with an
unbelievable number of cables if I had
to sort of come up with a disadvantage
other than the fact that it's expensive
it would be Wow
look at all the cables you're gonna be
like buried in cables this is what I
would look like if I was buried in
cables</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
