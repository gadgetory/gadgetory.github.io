trip to CES 2019 the courser one is
their new super-powerful water-cooled
gaming and or workstation system you can
check it out at the link below so of
course there is no stranger to launching
new RGB products at trade shows but this
time really I swear it's actually
different so this isn't just more RGB
LEDs with more animation patterns or
anything like that no okay actually
that's exactly what it is but I swear
it's different like get over here so
this right here is a demo of what
Corsair has been working with with a
company called Primax and they're
calling it capella --cz and what it
essentially is is a method of mounting
LEDs and not like not like this entire
surface mount like blocky square white
thing but actually the diode itself just
the little dot in the middle that
actually emits the light mounting LEDs
directly to a PCB and this is important
for a number of reasons it increases
power efficiency which in turn can
actually increase the maximum brightness
of the leds and it dramatically
increases their density so in the past
if they wanted to do let's say an RGB
memory module they would have been stuck
with like basically this kind of spacing
there's only so much granularity you can
get to the animations that you can build
into the product well now they can
achieve density of like I mean what do
you what even is this this is like a
hundred LEDs or eighty LEDs looks like a
hundred and it's like under my pinky and
I have I have very small hands folks
very very small fingers so right now
there's only one product that is going
to contain this new technology and it's
their new Dominator platinum RGB you can
actually see they've got like a history
of Dominator platinum here and they
haven't gone that crazy so they've only
got 12 of these capella X LEDs mounted
to it but what they're talking about
sounds pretty incredible because not
only can they mount these things to a
rigid PCV they can even mount them to a
flexible PCB so even some of their most
RGB tout products like some of their
fans with 16 LEDs built into them I mean
this is a whole new level they could put
hundreds of LEDs into a
and do like I mean they could even
display something when you think about
it
this is fundamentally a small LED
display it's absolutely incredible now
they're gonna need some software
upgrades because at the current time a
single channel off of I believe it's
their node pro controller is that sound
right
Aaron node Pro single channel 100 LEDs
at a time right now yeah they're so a
single channel can only support 100 LEDs
which is like I'd have to do this so
those guys have some work to do to catch
up to this but this enables all kinds of
new possibilities for LED lighting you
could conceivably have a system with
thousands or tens of thousands of LEDs
sille in a nutshell more compact more
power efficient or brighter so they
could do something like a wireless
backlit keyboard for example and just
generally more possibilities because
they can put them anywhere like that
look at the difference in profile here
it's crazy
speaking up for referrals they're
stepping up their game there as well so
we've had range issues actually with our
dark core RGB wireless mouse and our new
employee lounge and I was so thrilled to
see the harpoon RGB wireless so the
incredible thing about this is twofold
number one is the wireless technology
that they've built into it so Corsair
says but with a single device connected
to a dongle they've achieved 500
microseconds so that is about half of a
millisecond of latency on this thing and
with two devices connected like if you
had a a harpoon RGB wireless and then a
future keyboard that presumably they're
working on you could get one millisecond
on each and that's with a micro dongle
so this is a new technology they're
calling slipstream and the second really
cool thing about it is the price so
they're not holding back on us and
launching this with a hundred and fifty
dollar knows they want slipstream
freaking everywhere in their lineup and
they went well this mouse is the one
that's currently most ready for
production so we're gonna put it in
there boom let's go 50 bucks it's super
light it's just under 100 grams and the
range is actually really impressive so
it's running off of that system
they're one of the coarser 1i 140s but
that's not the crazy thing that's not
really that far it's that they're doing
it at CES so part of their slipstream
technology is that they're able to
straddle two frequencies at a time for a
very short period and decide on which
one is the best in order to maintain
that latency and showing it off working
at a trade show like CES without any
hitching is either brave or foolish
so far it's actually been working really
well for most of our time with it so I'm
leaning towards brave but I mean there's
still plenty of time for them to regret
this it's just looking pretty darn good
at the moment they're boasting thirty
hours of battery life using slipstream
or up to sixty using bluetooth LE
although of course there is a latency
disadvantage there and it comes with a
little compartment on the bottom for the
dongle as well as a switch so you can go
between 2.4 gigahertz slipstream and
Bluetooth this puppy is available hey
hey I Harry when's the harpoon available
now ok
you can buy it today so you can go check
it out at the link in the video
description speaking of the link in the
video description this video is brought
to you by the Corsair 1 the lineup goes
all the way from the i-140 which has an
RT x 2080 and an 8 core processor all
the way up to the I 180 Pro which is
really closer to a workstation than it
is to gaming with 12 cores 32 gigs of
ram an RT x 28 e TI a 750 watt power
supply and this is all in the same slim
form factor as the original Corsair 1 so
you can check that out at the link in
the video description thanks to Corsair
for sponsoring this video and thanks to
you guys for watching don't miss any of
our CES content we will see you guys at
the next move oh by the way the elgato
guys here at Corsair we're gonna be
super sad if I didn't mention their key
light so you can control it so check
this out you can adjust color
temperature and brightness and stuff
with your stream deck it's like Wi-Fi
connected if your streamer is pretty
sick if you're not a streamer then maybe
you just really like having like a light
on your desk but that's cool too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
