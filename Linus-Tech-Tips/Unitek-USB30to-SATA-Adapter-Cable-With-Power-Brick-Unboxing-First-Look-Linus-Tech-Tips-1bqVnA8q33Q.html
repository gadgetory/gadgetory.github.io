of the Unitec USB 3.0 2 SATA adapter it
is super speed USB which means it's up
to 10 times the performance versus USB 2
and that means up to a hundred and 80
megabytes per second it is um now let's
just flip it over and talk about the
specs a little bit these are really
useful and the reason these are useful
is because if you ever need to get data
off a drive or if you ever need to use a
hard drive without actually like hooking
it up properly to your system these
things can be a lifesaver and I'm at a
loss right now for what they're actually
called normally I would know but
basically it's just a little adapter a
piece that I'm gonna wait till I'm done
cutting this okay so it's a little
adapter piece that you can actually just
plug directly into the back of a drive
any Drive including a two and a half
four inch hard drive three-and-a-half
inch hard drive SSD drive anything you
want and then you it has a little
chipset inside that adapts the data
signal to something that can be used by
a USB port typically now this one is
cool okay because it is USB 3.0 so the
big advantage is that you can actually
access your your internal hard drive if
you need to if you're a technician say
for example and you carry around a drive
with all of your with a bunch of
programs and a bunch of applications
utilities all that kind of stuff you can
just plug it right into this plug it
into the customer system you don't
actually have to have an enclosure so if
you're testing hard drives this is a
great way to do it and with USB 3.0 you
can actually use the entire speed of a
hard drive and actually almost the
maximum of an SSD through a USB style
connection rather than having to plug it
in internally so you can see it's got a
little power LED here it has it's a
super speed USB certified logo here it
is SATA 2 or rather hold on let's see if
it's SATA or SATA 2 because that makes a
big difference let me see huh it doesn't
say you know what though I'll be doing a
I'll be doing a quick test on this oh
there we go there we go
aceite Gentoo i3 gigabit per second so
it is sata2 ready as well as supporting
USB to USB 3 and supports 2 terabytes
over hard drive so they're using a very
modern chipset to to adapt the USB 3.0
data to the SATA 2 data and then it also
comes with a power adapter and yeah the
power adapter plugs in here and I'm
actually going to find out I will do a
quick test on this thing just to show
you how fast it goes compared to having
the drive plugged in internally and I
also want to find out if you can
actually power a two and a half inch
drive directly from the USB 3.0 port
because USB 3.0 actually provides more
power over the port than USB 2.0 did and
then you also have the the optional
power adapter is included just in case
you do need more power so this has
gotten kind of rambley but I'm sure that
you can imagine all of the different
applications that there would be for a
device like this and I mean basically I
just wanted one so I'm unboxing it
because it's useful that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
