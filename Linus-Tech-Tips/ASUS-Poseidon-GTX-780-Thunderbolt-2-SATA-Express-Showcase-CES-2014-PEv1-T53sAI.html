brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital here in the asou suite
they've got a number of cool demos
running we're gonna start with the
components so first up is the ROG a
front base so this is a dual Bay display
/ knob / front panel connectors device
that allows you to control your
overclocked monitor fan speeds control
fan speeds as well as pass through your
front audio it adds another USB
connector to the front and it uses the
same interface as that that right there
The OC panel so it's compatible with the
rampage 4 Black Edition as well as any
of the z87 motherboards that feature
that OC panel header connector the
second thing in here is one that I'm
actually personally a little bit more
excited about this is the Zeus Poseidon
gtx 780 now there will be a 780ti
version that i've heard rumblings about
but basically guys the Poseidon concept
which we first saw at Computex is an air
cooling / liquid cooling hybrid product
now asus is telling me that from an air
cooling perspective the poseidon only
runs a handful of degrees warmer than a
regular card that doesn't have the built
in liquid cooling and while they're not
giving us an exact number with these
standard d 1/4 fittings in the ability
to hook it up to whatever liquid cooling
system you could possibly want I can
assure you that if you're going from
error and you're thinking about
upgrading to liquid it's gonna be worth
a look to consider the ability to easily
add liquid cooling to it if and if all
you're sacrificing is a couple of
degrees when you're running on air next
up we've got what looks like a standard
Isuzu z87 deluxe board except no this
one has some pretty different looking
connectors on the bottom corner here
this is the first time I've seen SATA
Express in person now what the connector
looks like is three discreet connectors
all next to each other but they actually
serve as one interface to a single drive
so two of them look like standard SATA 3
connectors and then there is a third
that actually is a
direct PCI Express 2x link so what this
enables once you connect a drive to it
is transfer speeds of up to 1000
megabytes per second or one gigabyte per
second so we're finally getting to the
point where we are removing the SATA 3
bottleneck that exists on many modern
SSDs without taking up a PCI Express
slot at the back of the case by going
with something like an asus Raider or
other PCIe SSD solution rounding out our
components showcase we've got the
thunderbolt ii x2 now going back to z77
even we've seen these TB underscore
header ports on a suits motherboards
that promised the ability to add
thunderbolt 1 to your motherboard as an
as an aftermarket upgrade option now we
never actually saw that productized and
i mean maybe it was a certification
issue or something like that so for me
personally I was like oh that's a little
disappointing because I was kind of
hoping that we'd see that well guys it's
here now this is Thunderbolt II x2 and
you can plug it into the TB header plug
it into a PCI Express slot and you can
actually add Thunderbolt connectivity to
any a seuss motherboard that has that TB
underscore header even the older ones so
the older TB underscore header is just
as compatible with Thunderbolt 2 as it
was with Thunderbolt 1 so you can get
that full 20 gigabit per second
connectivity now speaking of 20 gigabit
per second connectivity asus is also
showing off their okay now this one's
this one's got a bit of an odd name on
it so this is their z87 deluxe quad
which has two Thunderbolt 2 connectors
so the quadrat Iles this is four times
the potential total bandwidth that you
would get with a single Thunderbolt 1
connector now speaking of total
bandwidth in order to even demo this
they grabbed a couple of a seuss raiders
they built a custom PCB here so you can
see we've got a daisy chain coming out
from the back of the board and then from
one Raider to the second Raider and then
they're using a real-time test to show
you data throughput of these two cards
together on thunderbolt 2 now to be
clear Thunderbolt 2 is actually capable
of even higher speeds than this but it
just should give you some idea of
what we're looking at in terms of
capability of this technology moving
forward and that is running off of just
one of the Thunderbolt 2 ports on this
motherboard of course there are two of
them which makes it the quad motherboard
so thanks for checking out our Asus
component suite update here at CES 2014
remember our trip to the show is powered
by NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service as well
as course our memory and Western Digital
without those partners we wouldn't be
able to be here bringing you guys these
videos so a huge thanks to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
