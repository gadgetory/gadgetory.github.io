you guys it's got tech news it's got
jests it's got everything except some
kind of a coherent strategy today
because I'm gonna be totally honest with
you guys okay one thing first first
things first
hi Justine hi welcome to the show yes
it's absolutely my pleasure this is
actually our first time meeting even
though she's been here all day we
actually have hardly interacted I was
like are you sure he's here did I get
tricked warehouse that I just showed up
to is this how I die okay in my it's not
the least sketchy area no it's not it's
a bit wait it's not the most scary it's
also not the least sketchy so she's here
and then we've also got Steven from
gamers Nexus and Riley slash keys from
NCIX tech tips because Luke and I along
with our other special guests I don't
know if I'm gonna bring you guys on the
show because you guys are getting plenty
of camera time but get on here and kind
of say hi are they being Oh camera shy
you guys are so bashful you guys have
literally had a piece of glass in your
face all week we leave now oh wow look
at that it's right yeah yeah it's okay
it's okay
it's rod and Bob what's up guys dude
Linus and Luke just film another
week-long show with these guys why do we
keep inviting you here so our celebrity
judges were Justine Stephen and Reilly
and our co competitors were rod and Bob
stay tuned because tech showdown it'll
be I forget what I'm allowed to call
them now
whatever the tech showdown videos that
are gonna be coming soon are gonna be
totally unlike previous tech show downs
it's going to be pretty flippin sick so
right now it's showing viewers
zero which usually I have the twitch
chat up it's possible we are streaming
to no one it's also entirely possible
that it's not reporting correctly I'm
gonna find out what's going on you know
what I pretty much walked off of the set
onto here not pretty much literally that
is exactly what happened and and I
didn't have a lot of time to kind of set
everything up correctly so you'll have
to bear with me here mummification that
it's good yeah yeah yeah we're live
there are people watching it's all good
okay so thanks guys
so stay tuned for that and why don't we
jump into our Oh intro for the week but
well usually we'd tease some topics oh
yeah normally we tease sometime whatever
we've got crazy guests we don't need
topics there you could sit here and talk
about anything they're some of the best
shows have no news right now you know
alright functionalities and let's get
started so the original article here is
from Tom's guide I'm gonna go ahead and
throw that up but the word on the street
is when this click you know works at
some point it's a word that I'm pretty
excited about the iPhone 8 is the
world's fastest phone to go along with
my world's slowest a Wi-Fi right now
apparently not even close did you see
six core processors you see this coming
I know but I did see a bunch of reviews
of people doing speed tests you've been
comparing the eight to the note eight
which was incredible because they know
it definitely did lag behind yeah yeah
like specifically if we look at 3dmark
the iPhone 860 two thousand eight plus
sixty-four thousand note eight you just
referenced thirty-nine thousand yeah I
mean it's one of those things I got a
lot of flack from my no date review
people didn't really like it they said I
didn't really give it enough credit but
one of my key points was not that it was
a bad phone at all I said it's a great
phone it's probably the productivity
King if you have any use for the stylus
whatsoever actually there you go I know
being a huge iPhone fan too
I was quite surprised how much I really
liked it have you watched movies on it I
watched Netflix okay so any 21 by 9 like
ultra wide screen content it felt a
little bit wasn't ultra wide but it was
still it felt a little bit strange
because right a little bit I don't know
it's not rounded yeah I mean not to I'm
not gonna complain cuz I mean I watched
stuff on plane it's all the times that's
right it consumed most of my content so
I'm like this is a step up for the back
of an airplane but yeah I mean and I
think cameras too or something that is
what people are mostly into most a
normal person who is gonna go get their
phone they just want us to take
incredible photos to share out and you
know even getting a chance to see it at
the Apple event I mean the gold so I'm
getting so excited but in comparison to
the X that's what I'm gonna be
interested to see because the hype
around
eight is way less than previous years
and there are tons of people that were
talking about there were no lines right
usual but I feel like that'll be way
different for the end o the X is gonna
be a completely different story because
and don't take this the wrong way it's
it doesn't have to be a derogatory term
but that's the one that zombies are
lining up for yeah I will be there like
if I was with my undead bells on and and
it's just it's it's one of those things
where anyway so back to the back to the
no date one of my criticisms one of my
key criticisms was that every previous
note had something really different
really killer about it and I feel like
Apple killed that with the iPhone X if
they didn't do that the eighth lick the
face right no the eighth is the most
boring phone of all time it's
essentially a 7 s can you believe
they're still using the same shell as
the 6 no which is kind of crazy we need
tried to get away with it by saying it's
the glass back which it does look really
good like I like that look that's going
back to like the iPhone 4 when they
first introduced that which was I I love
I still have an iPhone 4 actually on my
nightstand it's a great look I bought it
right basically yeah yeah I just use it
when I need like if I'm going to
somewhere where like I might get mugged
or whatever and I but I want a phone I
just take my iPhone 4 people are like
give me your phone
well clearly you don't have much love
for it if you're gonna give it up
industries well no come on it's worth
less than my life I'll say that much to
add some more stats to this before we
can going in Geekbench for the iPhone 8
was 54% faster than the Galaxy Note 8
and in just 54 percent and just in
standard media encoding I don't remember
exactly what was it was a two-minute 4k
video yes encoded the iPhone 8 finished
in 42 seconds the note 8 took more than
three minutes and the galaxy s 8 plus
took more than four minutes so what that
tells us is two things number one is
that the iPhone 8 is hella fast and
number two is that they are actually
walking the walk when it comes to GPU
computing and CPU computing and marrying
them together yeah because I am
has been talking about that since the
acquisition of ati back in what was it
Stephen would know this was it 2008 ati
acquisition yeah
so whatever about 10 years ago since
then AMD has been talking about how the
GPU is going to be this fun matte fusion
they called it you were not going to be
able to tell the difference between a
CPU doing something in a GPU doing
something you were just going to click
go on a web page or you were going to
click encode on a video or you know warp
stabilized in a video editing
application and it was just gonna use
whichever one it used or some mixture of
the two and we were gonna treat the GPU
like like more CPU cores and programmers
we're gonna get into it and it never
happened but this is one of those
infuriating things for the non Apple
folks out there where Apple takes an
idea that everybody else has been
talking about for all this frickin time
and then actually does it does a Russian
I mean you know being a huge Apple fan I
think I get so much crap from the rest
of you guys which you know I I and it
for fair for fair reasons you know I
mean what Apple is good at is taking all
the things that everyone has been doing
really really well and then they make it
a widespread thing for everyone to enjoy
and the easy to use like during the
Apple event there's a few things I know
wireless charging was one of them for me
where I was like yeah thank god they're
doing it fine so everyone will do
exactly I'm I was so afraid that just
completely unnecessarily they were gonna
make it some other today we're gonna
make it proprietary to I was like no I
was I was sure of it you know what I
think we actually do have like
lackluster but present adoption of the
technology broadly enough I think we
have that to thank for Apple kind of
going okay this has enough momentum now
that we don't need to absolutely break
all the things for no apparent reason
yeah I mean I thought they might have
switched USBC for the X but they didn't
I was I was kind of hoping that they
would as well and I was really hoping
like a lot of devices have a type C port
but if you go and transfer photos off of
them they're actually running at USB to
speeds
know that Apple actually did have a USB
3 lightning connector on the iPad pro as
if I believe the first gen so I'll be
interested to see if the Lightning
connector on the X is at least USB 3
that would be sick no I'm not question I
just knows you called it the X I'm sorry
it's 10 I know and I do that because I
use Final Cut X which is also Final Cut
10 right and I've been calling it that
at the beginning so it's I'm so sorry
but then apples thing is like OS X is
not OS X its OS 10 so there they have a
long enough history of X is 10 that
we're just supposed to ignore that all
the other phones are called 7 and not
VII well where did the iPhone 9 go yeah
that I have a theory
I think the iPhone 9 is coming next
September that's actually a brilliant
idea that I didn't even think of so the
iPhone 9 is coming and it's gonna still
be the like step down it's gonna be like
the the new SE and then the X 2 or the
11 or whatever whatever they end up
going with in terms of this series
naming or the X mark - you know what
that I hear again tinfoil hat I think
they're just gonna call it the iPhone 10
again next year I think they're just
gonna call it the same thing because
they've done it with every other bloody
product line if they actually add like
mark - that's kind of cool but they
don't yeah I know that's the issue
you said mark - I was like this pretty
late 2018 technically the the eight
should be a 7s but I mean I'm if I'm not
mistaken I believe it's the same 11 chip
that is also in the 8 and the X is that
correct I believe so yeah yeah so I
don't know I mean they're still sharing
a lot of that same technology and I
think it's gonna be like do you want
facial recognition and do you want to
give up that touch ID button
I don't touch ID touch ID I don't think
my parents would either so I feel like
it's there's a different kind of
generation gap and I don't know it's
yeah it's gonna be interesting to see
when the X comes out we got what people
kind of gravitate towards I think that's
part of the reason we didn't get a new
shell for the 8 is that now it's the
value from
yeah yeah in the min much the same way
that like you uh you know if you buy an
se it's that iPhone five shell yeah so
the value phone is like the like it's
one of those things where Apple status
it's it's a it's a status symbol where
if you get the jet black one everyone
knows you're a mega baller and bought
the top of the line and then you put a
case on it but in much the same way you
don't even know there's no way you can
even tell it unless you look I think
Apple wants people who buy an eight to
feel like last gen champs a little bit
for at a glance for it to not look any
different for sure yeah I mean if they
even wrote a to the camera right no
that's on the X the X has the rotated
camera yeah that's what I'm saying yeah
so it's like extremely recognizably
different yes it's really I don't think
that was for a reason Goodman yeah I'm
not actually sure that'd be interesting
to see what I'd like to see like an I
fix it teardown or something
so it's killer fast which really
surprised me because Apple stubbornly
stuck to two core designs for the
longest time when the entire rest of the
industry was going like no put all the
cores into the phones even though
historically it hasn't made a huge
difference to performance in the
applications that most people are using
but if I had to guess I would say this
this this utilization of both CPU and
GPU and this addition of multiple course
is really Apple's way of saying okay
look we think that people are going to
need all these cores for the kinds of
workloads that are coming to phones in
the near future and if it's if it's
Apple they're pretty good at predicting
that now I had people approach me out of
the blue and say can you believe so much
of the keynote was about this stupid
like facial emoji thing oh that a well
they spent a lot of time on the watch
which okay yeah because who cares about
the watch no offense okay but to be fair
okay listen you you will have your in
tightly you don't even need to have your
phone like you can have LTE on your
wrist granted the battery life is not
very good I think they might have talked
time of like an hour but the fact that
you don't need your phone you can live
okay don't I don't want to don't don't
y'all stand up I don't care I mean I
don't think it's for everybody but I
think that that is somewhat
revolutionary in the fact that you
really don't need this I don't need
anything I can go for a walk I don't and
you can go for a walk but don't go far
yeah sorry Brandon it's because
Justine's a little bit further back here
if you if you if you scooch up then
we're good yep getting rally and like
don't you start look the watch the watch
it has the potential okay I have a
marked zero or whatever I have the
original one and my issue with it is
that it's a development kit it is not a
finished product it is a showcase of
what they want the Apple watch to do
with a piss-poor battery and no ability
to have the actual time showing all the
time well at least I know what time it
is it sometimes takes a little while
yeah but I and I do think that of course
this is gonna be the first gen of so I
mean the joke in review is that it works
great if you're sitting there and if you
don't mind whoever you're with to know
that you're like yeah yo what time it is
but like okay imagine this like so in my
review I bring up like what if you're in
the middle of an awkward sexual
encounter you're on your back you know
you want to know what time it is it
literally doesn't work you can't find
out who you're talking you can't find
out when it's gonna be over but it
doesn't have the red dot on it cuz if
not it's not LTE and I need to leave and
is it ceramic I need to know no I think
I think it makes a little bit more sense
maybe in the States because you guys and
get companion Sims very easily coming up
here is it's not yet really okay so if I
came here I actually wouldn't be able to
use it so let's talk about the bump okay
so that last last Apple topic for now
but let's talk about the bump on the
watch then they made a big song and
dance about how they used the same frame
with all the new tech package right two
pieces of paper
thicker out
the crystal okay where's the endpoint of
that are they're just gonna keep is
gonna keep doing this and just keep
making the bum bigger but I honestly I
looked at it and if and then I put it on
and I could not tell the difference I
mean you look two pieces of paper what
it seems like it would be very hard to
notice you would not be able to notice
cuz you already can feel this and it's
on your wrist but yeah you're not the
two pieces of paper you're fine yeah
but if you want to find some more
reasons to hate it oh oh that's no we
don't have time for that that's pretty
that's pretty easy for me to do hold on
a second if there's anything else
interesting in here yeah oh okay this is
off MacRumors calm I have some bad news
for you did you know this yet I mean
we've kind of all been assuming it since
they announced it dun dun da iPhone 10
production faces further delays will
start in mid-october okay I got two
questions for you do you think
apparently final production of the
iPhone 10 has yet to even start yes I
mean pre-orders are starting the 3rd or
27th wait pre-orders of the 3rd and it's
supposed to ship the 27th so if you had
to guess what do you think it is
what's the supply chain issue yeah hmm
do you think okay do you think it's that
they can't get enough or do you think
it's that they need too much I guess
it's sort of two different ways of
looking at it
so they mean realistically they
obviously made one we had it on the
stage like they may have been waiting
though to see how the eight did you
think so potentially I mean because the
screen you think is this currently
giving the screen from Samsung yeah so
they could also be limiting this why
there's not a ton of room yeah well
don't screw over more cuz you're gonna
stay on the edge look we aren't set up
for guest very well more like this Mike
is in like a terrible position there's a
way better way to do this set up and I
have not been approved yet to fix it you
have it no I asked you to and you're
like that's way too expensive it's way
too expensive
it's like four or five hundred bucks
that's the answer to any stupid you can
also just take this mic and like
probably get Jake to 3d print something
yeah that would probably wear you that
would probably work yeah well there was
also some people that were talking about
they weren't 100% sure if the facial
recognition was ready so it could also
be a software thing yeah that might have
been a response
yeah to what happened on stage but what
happened on stage was that phone had
been restarted and any time you restart
it you have to add the pin yeah yeah so
I mean it could be a combination of
software not ready and also supply
demand for the screens which is very
realistic yeah this article also covered
that the iPhone 8 is not getting as much
interest from customers as previous
smartphones launched this fall and
suggests that there could be many Apple
fans holding out for the iPhone 10 yeah
really or you just get the 8 and then
get the 10 and then you know and just
keep you could just you could just rub
them on your body every day try to
absorb the Apple miss gives my sister
today she's like shy go buy iphone I was
like oh you're never gonna get one she's
like walked in the Best Buy got one and
just I was like well that was easy
so I'm not sure right the supply I mean
people like are still getting them same
day designs weren't very long but the
pre-orders was very smooth and normally
all of the Apple pre-orders is a
disaster so maybe things just worked
well for it is a it is a real departure
from standard Apple operating procedure
for them to roll out a slide that
basically says it's everything you love
about the iPhone 7 but better for for
the iPhone 8 yeah nothing they didn't
say magical they didn't say
revolutionary they didn't say because
it's nice though so but usually they
find a way to make it seem like that's
true like just plastic so it's
unapologetic what they were saving that
for the x10 10 I guess so but it's just
like they still need to sell iPhone 8
guy I bet they probably won't have that
much of an issue yeah probably not
probably not and they'll be able to slow
some overtime so they'll move them
eventually yeah
all right so our next topic thank you
and it's all thank you I'll talk to you
soon
yes once we're done the show our next
topic is definitely right in Stephens
wheelhouse so get on in here all right
this is fun how's it going pretty good
do you want to introduce yourself
sure I'm Steve from cameras Nexus we do
technical hardware reviews and analysis
all right speaking of technical hardware
reviews and analysis add to that for a
quick second we've referenced Steve and
gamers Nexus quite a few times on Wayne
show if you've heard us talk about
things like the Noctua
color controversy and a few other things
you guys followed up yeah that one was
interesting yes if you guys want to see
stuff like that a one thing that I
really like when you guys this channel
is how you'll dive into like how
something was made yeah and kind of
sometimes Ripa company anyone a little
bit but yeah a little it's a fine line
to walk yeah yeah yeah but I I like the
attention to detail anyways well like my
consumers you get a mixed reaction on
the other side of things that you
mentioned gamers Nexus so rumored coffee
like pricing okay so okay now I don't
know how much you know or don't know and
you don't know how much I know or don't
know about coffee Lake so all we can go
based on is what we are reading off of
this page in front of us which is copied
off of PC hub online PL or awesome -
table dot-com okay so this is what we're
going on this is all the information
that we have but there is some good
information in here so it tells us how
many cores it's rumored to have what the
TDP it's rumored to be will be
but that tells us the rumored TDP tells
us rumored cash tells a socket rumored
and it tells us clock speed rumors as
well so apparently the core i7 8700 K
might end up landing about $400 as a
rumored to be six core 12 thread
processor at 3.7 to 4.7 gigahertz and
you know whatever 95 watt TDP
is that too high does that kill it is
that USD perhaps that's a conversion to
USD no that's so here's the thing we
were talking with our patreon back is a
little bit about this the problem I have
with this guy just drop the patreon plug
in there that's not great at the
beginning too so this guy seen a YouTube
retention graph so yeah I talked to them
and the thing is it is evolution for
Intel to go to 6 and 12 right that's
definitely a movement but if you're
moving in that direction and then
sticking a similar price on it to what
you had on previous high-end i7s well
like the low end of the h EDT cts I
don't it doesn't it's not really that
much of an evolution so does this see
that's the price does this smell like if
that pricing is correct which I don't
know if it is but if it is does this
smell a little bit like 69 50x yeah well
so here's a 2 more course yeah oh by the
way it costs $700 more than the 8 core
we had last gen oh by the way there's an
8 core and enjoy one thing I can say
about price because I've said this
before we had a an undisclosed
manufacturer talked to us not long ago
about pricing targets and I was told 10
to 20 more than the existing i7 Caesar
bear-bear it's disruptive rare it's
potentially a rise in clobberer I mean
you had you got this word right on your
shirt here gamers right would gamers
have a reason to buy a rise in processor
if the 8700 K is 10 20 bucks more than a
7700 K there's you know there's a whole
lot of in that question how does it
overclock your eyes the platform stable
but let's assume it's a it's a
reasonably well thought out Intel launch
let's assume turbo boost up to 4.7 works
as expected
let's assume that everything is goes
well should you even buy o rise it if
you only play games
and you're looking at spending about the
same amount of money then probably not
if it's $100 more than an r7 1700 and he
do things like actual content creation
that is CPU accelerated not just GPU
accelerated yeah then you should
definitely be looking at Rison so I
think it comes down to a lot of things
you know there are a lot of people with
the rise and launch where people who are
content creators are realizing there's
so much performance I've left on the
table yeah and they can really
accelerate it now
and people who aren't content creators
but want to see AMD succeed are saying I
can multitask but there's a difference
between having twitch and your music
open and playing a game yeah and actual
like what you do or what we do
production yeah so I don't it depends
like at $408 I think that's a little too
much now the chart also has some
expected pricing for other processors
and it has the it has the 86 hundred K
so that's the rumored six core six
thread at 286 so we could be seeing this
particular listing inflated on the i7
because that's the most popular we know
from our Amazon sales affiliate link
stuff we know it's by far intel's most
popular channel processor anyway but if
we're looking at let's say the price gap
is more like a hundred which is what it
normally is so let's say that one is
more like you know 380 something at 286
again the gamer question and the rumor
is that the 8400 will also be a six core
part I mean that according to previous
asterisk 400 part should be like a 235
to $45 part yeah and again it's not
really it's not a linear evolution if
the price increases yeah it moves the
bar so currently I fives and we set this
in our review of the our fives
there's not a lot of reason to buy an
i-5 right now the i7 still holds on
really well yeah but you look at our
fives and there's there's actual
there's Gaines and frame times in
specific games where you don't really
get that change with an i7 who's already
got all the threads yeah so yeah I mean
I I would need to see i-5 stay of the
same price if they're increasing core
count or come down with the current core
count to be viable to me still I think
part of the issue here and it's not
going to make up like a hundred and
fifty dollars but part of the issue here
is that we're going from another
currency and converting back to USD and
it's not just dollar conversion no it's
not there's different prices in
different regions import taxes there's
all there's the fact that this is an
early listing so they could be trying to
they could be trying to convince stupid
customers to preorder based on this
pricing that will actually drop on
launch day once availability is real and
pricing is real and everyone gets their
listings up yeah some include like v80
and stuff too yeah yeah so this yeah
this could have like 90% included so
we'll take it we'll take it for what it
is a rumor based on incomplete data at
best and I would say to add some value
to the rumor like my look at it is if it
is four hundred to four time for the i7
that's kind of too much it might be a
good performer yeah but that's more than
I want to see if it's like 10 to 20
dollars more than the current I sevens
that falls in line with Intel's current
price creep where every generation
they've very slowly increased it dollars
at a dime yeah so that's that's kinda
play a long game don't they do an yeah
so sometimes you look at what they're
doing you go but then other times you
look at what they're doing you go yes um
speaking of rumors with not a ton of
credibility this one's from WCF tech
apparently this came out of eurocom it
is rumored and this is again this is
very early rumors that the upcoming 10
nanometer ice Lake will bump the core
count from 6 to 8 and then the thread
count from 12 to 16 to match AMD's rise
and 7 and that'll be second half of 2018
so the timing sounds right because intel
does refresh every year even if they
don't really have anything to show us
animals Kenny are you
I could have guessed that though they're
gonna go that processor next year yeah
but I wouldn't have I actually wouldn't
have guessed they'd go 8-4
I would have said they might not bother
I was kind of expecting a core for
coffee lake so yeah yeah because I don't
know like it takes a while to make a CPU
so it's not like coffee lake is a
response to rise and specifically as a
piece of silicon there might be
marketing attached to it that is but
yeah they might be pricing attached that
is like we might have seen a six core
coffee leg as like a 4:49 mainstream
processor to blur the lines even further
right yes I don't really know much about
Eisley I don't know anything officially
and I have my follow tumors yeah well I
think it's pretty damn early I don't the
rumors get overwhelming at a point I try
to stay away from right and we're so
flowing out like that's something I've
been saying about you and Joe we've been
covering rumors of the same AMD farts
for like over a half a year like I think
we're like nine months in oh man okay
tinfoil hat damn AMD rumors are they
actually leaks or are they buzz
generation created intentionally by an
by or a company associated with by an or
a company associated with them and
there's two facets to the answer if you
think it's people at AMD do you think it
is sanctioned or do you think it is like
guerrilla black guerrilla marketing from
people at AMD who like think they have
hot shame about it they have their own
guerrilla marketing from Red Team plus
is that it yeah yeah that's I mean that
kind of fills that role already I don't
know like I've only ever had one person
approach me and say here's some leaked
information like that's happened one
time and it wasn't really anything to
work with like it was it was clearly a
please post this we need something yeah
so it wasn't like our IHS azar soldered
right but it wasn't from a big three
like major engineering
in my company so I don't act like
there's so I don't think they would need
to manufacture rumors it seems like the
community kind of does that well enough
all right fair enough
so my theory is that it's gorillas
because I mean if you've spent any time
in Taiwan or around Taiwanese people
working in Taiwanese companies you'll
know that the the way the industry is
inbred is actually unfathomable from the
outside like the way people flit around
from company to company sometimes even
landing back at the same one multiple
times
everybody knows everybody and Taiwan is
a small place literally yeah a small
place and the thing about it is that
even if you look at companies like well
you could kind of go well AMD's not
headquartered in Taiwan now there's
Intel sure but you got to understand if
you want to build a motherboard for a
see if you get working with people in
Taiwan and China and probably Hong Kong
there's people in Taiwan who have spec
sheets for ice Lake based on what Intel
is expecting like now like they're
thinking about it they're working people
who make retention the the actual like
size retention did probably already know
or will soon yeah yeah so yeah I mean
and and you would think that loyalty or
legal like action ability at that level
is so far removed that it'd be easier to
leak something yep
yeah rather than getting legal to sign
off on something right I mean we've had
like I've had really frank conversations
with okay I'll say with a big three
company that I criticized recently I'll
say that so one of them so one of them
and the conversation went look you guys
have an opportunity right now to turn
this criticism into a huge PR win all
you have to do is come on stream with me
and talk about it talk about how you did
something maybe not wrong but not in the
consumers best interest
hide from questions and say sorry and
commit to do better that's what you have
to do you can take this thing that we
can hopefully both agree if we both live
on planet earth and drink the same water
and eat the same food and live in the
same reality that we can both agree
happen so that's questions yeah and you
guys can just take it head-on
and the email thread is actually quite
long like it's a couple dozen replies
and there was a conference call that did
take place where we talked about it and
then it went dead so it got killed by a
c-level or a VP level or legal and we're
just not gonna talk about it apparently
that happens a lot with legal I found
yeah like going to for example a recent
example the statement on Vega pricing
being exceptionally ambiguous right
there was a reason for that and it's a
legal reason really so well yeah but not
like we're gonna get probably beat them
to it yeah like a priest or a
pre-emptive typical like legal being
overly concerned about specific phrasing
yeah that kills a lot of conversations
yeah yeah which is unfortunate because
he like if you got people on this either
any kind of corporate representative to
actually answer harder questions whether
or not the the answer is actually good
yeah yeah that'd still be a big thing
yeah that's unfortunate okay last topic
that that I think should be a pretty
good one for you actually do you prefer
this one you do want to find something
else what's the other one
hold on hold on I got this I got this
this one that's kind of interesting okay
sure running a website so this was
posted by good bites on the forum don't
worry I know but basically in a nutshell
thanks to JavaScript which is not to be
confused with Java the programming
language the Pirate Bay website has put
code in their site that turns visiting
computers into mining machines for
cryptocurrency without the user knowing
so your CPU fan is just going to like
ramp up visit
the visitors of the site are completely
unaware of the activity other than if
you open up task manager you'll see that
your CPU is spiking to really high load
maybe even reaching a hundred percent
and you may notice that your system is
going to be a little bit less responsive
if you're quite familiar with how it's
supposed to be running so piratebay not
run by super ethical people so
regardless of what we say about the
validity of this I think they're gonna
keep doing it but your thoughts so as I
understand it after this was discovered
yeah they said it was a 24 hour trial
yes and I got a quote you wanna go yeah
the minor is being tested for a short
period approximately 24 hours as a new
way to generate revenue so they didn't
Vince any words no yeah they don't care
from from like I I will say that in a
sort of malicious way it is app it's
absolutely brilliant to try and make
money without being found out but it's
so it's it's yeah it's it's clever but
just like how the word great can be used
for evil yeah but I mean right idea so
the thing with that particular
cleverness is that when you are found
out and they were it's pretty bad
you know really digging into hi it's
generating more I don't power
consumption yeah I don't think they care
here's a question for you though if
you're still a Pirate Bay user at this
point like I don't follow the piracy
scene as closely as I once did it is no
secret that I had a pirated copy of far
cry I definitely did part of the issue
was that my disc one didn't work anymore
okay but there were definitely other
games I didn't have a broken business
let's put it that way okay but even I
know but with all the issues they've
gone through with some of the changes in
terms of the personnel running it oh
yeah pirate bay is not Pirate Bay and I
wouldn't be over there using it so in my
mind if you're still
using piratebay are you even gonna
notice the cps bye are you gonna know of
an alternative are you just stuck with
it yeah I if you're using it at this
point I guess you're either very loyal
or don't know a better option
loyal to what a logo royal - I know this
I like what I can get from here I
haven't looked elsewhere like any other
brand loyalty you were talking about
Apple a few minutes ago yeah that I was
talking about this coin Hein the coin
hive javascript minor has definitely
been used before we've talked about a
story I don't remember I don't know what
website I don't think it was a site at
this kind of scale though no I don't
even remember it was like it might have
been I feel like I had something to do
with Minecraft er I don't know but like
it's been used before for sure like here
I'm bringing up is it org these days I I
don't know I can't remember but okay so
bring it up on Alexa which is an
inherently flawed yeah
data collection method apparently
they're like in the top 100 sites global
rank 89 okay if you check a traffic
estimate calm or Quantcast you'll get a
pretty accurate picture yeah okay so
let's throw let's throw it over there as
well the Pirate Bay org is new policy it
is yea probably changes crap estimated
monthly traffic visits in the 70 million
range per month that's bigger than on
intact when it was like at its peak it
was about 40 million P well it's
somewhere around there but they were at
40 million pageviews four per month for
a while Wow just to give you a sense of
scale this also has it at an Alexa rank
of 136 so like I don't know how
up-to-date any of this data is the point
is it's a big site and if you were
hitting like let's say half of the
people noticed if you were hitting 2530
million machines for and and it runs as
long as the tab is open somewhere in
your browser
for even a few hours a day even for that
24-hour period that's pretty good
yeah you hit a couple million systems
yeah and you just go to sleep and wake
up with well it's like a it's basically
they built a botnet to mine but they
don't even have to install malware on
unless you yeah right so it's like
brilliant in that way but it's also like
supremely dickish yeah and I mean you're
in that community so like I don't know
is okay last last discussion point
around this are you getting your just
desserts for pirating I don't know yeah
are you sure you're not gonna come on
it's the land show no one holds you to
anything you say
I don't think it's necessarily just
because I think you would have to know a
different direction
Thank You justice relies on a fair trial
blah blah blah system yeah exactly I
think it's like you're in like the the
Undercity and you're trying to
pickpocket something and someone's in
your pocket too and things are just
happening so you're painting the pirate
as the downtrodden like no no no like
like you know like the jedis go down to
the Undercity to do some shady stuff
sometimes - sometimes good people go
down there I'm having a hard time
following your analogy I think so I
there are if you go to like the shady
part of town to buy some like lifted
item and something bad happens you while
you there like you didn't ask for it to
happen but like oh that's like you also
could have avoided it you probably could
have avoided it but then then now we can
bring up the Sony rootkit thing could
you have avoided it by going to the
shiny store that's well-lit on the mains
but then I feel good buying it that I
feel bad but also from the I think there
there are valid uses for torrents for
one yeah they're not as widespread
probably at least not publicly known
so there's valid reasons to use them
there are people who are visiting the
site we've used taurine mm-hmm we
passenger his files
yeah patching games especially way back
in the day I know I think it's Eve
client the best way to download it for
alarm Blizzard Blizzard couldn't
possibly have afforded dedicated servers
in the early days of Wow you know yeah
with all that Wow money you could turn
off the peer-to-peer downloading okay so
sorry go ahead you were gonna say
something and then you were kind of
letting us talk over easily I could
avoid it so I'm not I'm not little not
letting that happen again
I wasn't trying to avoid it I think
there are people maybe visiting the site
for reasons that are not that don't
involve torrenting are stealing software
I see yeah what if what if I'm
researching a story right and I go there
and I'm a feel really bad for the for
people yeah right maybe whenever you're
Star Wars Battlefront 2 came out more
than a decade ago I had the disc it
didn't work because it had whatever
yeah curity crap on it and so I had to
download the game but I had a valid
serial number so to me that was a
justified use absolutely cuz I paid for
it
sure work especially if you put in the
serial number like yeah yeah yeah that's
that's so I I don't know that it's as
simple as an eye for an eye
in this instance no no it's not so so
the collateral damage argument the fact
that it is not just if it is not you
know if there's no justice system yeah
so ok we're in agreement then they're
gigantic dicks right ok cool
I'm speaking of gigantic dicks off
Reilly well I could have meant that
you're really well-endowed I didn't
such a nice thing to say such an awkward
thing to say so hi I'm Riley I'm from a
channel called NCIX tech tips barely not
heard you've probably never heard of it
- we make we make videos about computers
sort of like you but sort of in the
style of Linus but he's gone now yeah
yeah mentally I feel like when you have
kids you'll understand ya know I'm gonna
be calling you up for advice yeah my
advice just get the operation now okay
now I'm just kidding I love my kids
they're wonderful my kids are ever
watching this in the door this is gonna
this is gonna end up being like one of
those things where you you say look like
I'm not saying you know a Hitler was you
know or what I didn't say it I didn't
say but where people take the clip right
oh you know what actually I'm gonna kick
you off for a second you guys I'm sure
you want nothing to do with our like
sponsors yeah okay see you later sir
you'll be better he'll be back in a
second
I promise I'll bring you back no I
didn't just bring you in for that right
for okay brilliant
Oh like he makes videos so our sponsors
today Squarespace I wonder you know what
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go off skirting
I'm not gonna go I'm just there might be
a difference we're gonna end up saying
beaut build it beautiful which we're not
allowed to show during our Squarespace
spots three minutes have gone by and
there's been two of them together man
where's space the place to go if you
want to build a beautiful simple website
it starts at just 12 bucks a month you
get a free domain if you by Squarespace
for the year it's super easy like if we
were building float playing on
Squarespace it would be done like ages
ago all you got to do is you pick one of
their templates you like drag and drop
pictures and text boxes you populate
everything in boom you've got a
beautiful website that works great
across every device and they've got tons
of great features to make your life easy
like their commerce module every website
comes with a store there come
pages with such a set up a beautiful
one-page presence in minutes and you can
publish content in Apple news format no
that's not new directly from the
Squarespace blog module they've also got
their logo designer basically it's
awesome you can start a trial with no
credit card required at squarespace.com
slash win then when you look at your
site and you go gee I'd sure like to
keep this probably I gotta start paying
and you can use offer code when to save
10% on Squarespace on your first
purchase on your first purchase thank
you for that no worries I'm genuinely
thank you don't you our second sponsor
is iFixit do they really need an
introduction apparently they think they
do because they're still sponsoring the
Wynn show you for needing me we love you
guys we really do I fix it makes great
products we use them for the last week
they have great guides so if you want to
be part of the right to repair
revolution or even if you don't care
about that whole politicized sort of
thing that's going on and you're just
gonna whether it's illegal or legal
you're just gonna repair your stuff
regardless I fix it's got you covered
they've got guides for how to do it
they've got replacement hard-to-find
parts things like gaskets and and
adhesive seals stuff that you otherwise
wouldn't be able to put your device back
together with and they've got all the
tools you need for disassembly and
they're Pro Tech tool kit which is
awesome is now only $60 including their
64 bit driver kit all the prying and
wedging tools you need to take apart
almost anything super suction cups their
flex extension and it's awesome
so basically head over to ifixit.com
slash Linus and snag a pro Tech tool kit
for just 60 bucks odds are you'll spend
less on your Pro Tech tool kit than you
would have on a single repair taking it
to a shop to have somebody else do it
for you and then you'll be equipped for
the future leading us to our last
monster hold on hold on we're keeping it
knit slip knit knit slip free we're
trying were trying
yeah Mac well I'm still really enjoying
my job so Mac welding tons of
comfortable clothes whether we're
talking underwear socks shirts
undershirts hoodie sweatpants they are
so confident you're gonna love them that
if you order they will action till you
order like a pair of boxers if you don't
like your first pair you can keep it and
they will still refund you no questions
asked
best thing about Mac Weldon for me
personally as someone who sweats a bit
you know it's it's not really sweat it's
more of like a glow you know okay
healthy glow they have a line of silver
underwear and shirts that are naturally
antimicrobial
that's what silver does which if you
guys know much about sweat is what
causes it to smell and so they are
naturally actually odor killing which is
pretty cool so go over to Mac Weldon
calm and use offer code tectus to save
20% 20% go check it out it's pretty good
comfy clothes and you won't smell as bad
as me unless I'm also wearing that
quilted then again if you don't sweat as
much as me
then like I mean it's it's not magic
it's antimicrobial it's not like it's
not like a frickin chemical bath your
nipples at this point actually very well
okay cuz I feel like I stink using them
going out of this way yeah number of
times he's like oh here I could show my
nipples here yeah they're okay nipples
they're great done I mean they're not
like they're no they're not like really
disgusting or anything so ya know
they're fine I've ever been one of our
one of our first recruitment video like
yeah I'm just gonna wear my boxers yeah
like I wrote that portion of the video
where Edie comes out with a laptop and
he's he's just like okay Linus are you
ready for the shoot that and I'm just
like in my boxers with sunglasses on
holding like two mp5s yeah and he's just
like don't know no I'm just like what
what let's see why that seems like an
Ivan move yeah mp5 so we were just
trying to have something so weird that
they used to work again yeah
thank you again wow it's so interesting
oh my good have seen that coming
so similar sense of humor let's jump
right into this have you had a look at
this have you seen this google buys HTC
but it's a little more complicated than
that so the original article here is
from Android central 1.1 billion
basically for the right to hire people
you know I don't know I feel like they
say they what what who do they hire
Motorola before they will they buy yeah
and then flip them so hook them over so
I feel like they'd be like okay we tried
buying a phone company before and it
didn't work out well maybe the issue was
that they bought Motorola who hadn't
done anything relevant I mean okay lots
of patents mmm-hmm but okay so this is
at it effects apparently about 2,000
employees the reason why I'm stuttering
is this deal is to be able to hire them
at a cost of about five hundred fifty
thousand dollars per employee the
Primeau employees are the best you've
never seen employees like this this also
gives them a non-exclusive license to
HTC's intellectual property now I
suspect if I had to guess based on that
HTC's tooth non-exclusive is fine
because from what I can tell Google
doesn't want HTC to go out of business
hmm so they're not gonna like
exclusively license everything and hire
what is it I think it's about half of
their staff that right does it have on
them I think it's something like that
don't don't quote me on that one though
but it says it's a significant number of
their staff they don't want them to go
out of business
because they still I believe they still
intend to contract manufacturer with HTC
they are not acquiring any of the
manufacturing right the employees get
any of the cash from they're like oh
right to be sold like cattle I super vet
not like this is so yeah yeah it's like
they're paying Google is paying HTC for
the right to pay the employer wage
but why don't get anything whether HTC
has made anything relevant in the last
three years or not they always queasy
thing sorry go ahead
they own a ton of cell phone IP because
they were the og Android cell phone
manufacturer hmm
so one of them one of the biggest
challenges around building a product is
not figuring out how to build a product
one of the biggest challenges is
figuring out how to build a product
without infringing on an 800-pound
gorilla who's going to just lawsuit you
into the dirt hmm for building something
that happens to infringe on their patent
even if you developed it independently I
mean that's why it's pretty much
impossible for anyone else to show up
and become a GPU manufacturer at this
point it's like done Intel tried and if
Intel can't do it quite frankly
well maybe Apple could still do it my
question is I don't think so
my question is how many times is Google
going to do this like when an Android
phone manufacturer is struggling because
when they bought Motorola Motorola was
basically like Dyne irrelevant yep and
then if they hadn't been bought they
would have been done but now they're
doing great again it's well sort of but
like you know that yeah you're seeing I
wouldn't be surprised if it kept happen
remember it's really hard to tell if a
Chinese backed company is doing great
well okay I don't know their numbers
because they could just be getting like
you could be seeing like all these ads
and all these new like products and all
this stuff but it could be just
literally Chinese government money just
by paying for all of it true and then
just buying the inventory off the
shelves when it's done and burying it in
a hole like we don't know or
incinerating it and then creating rain
to like we don't know yeah no that's
fair but in terms of like brand
awareness I mean I know I know that I've
been hearing a lot more about like the
moto moto G Series and stuff right there
they kind of found anisha's like this
budget thing like my brother-in-law has
one I think they're killing it
yeah too right yeah is my understanding
anyway is the same good thing gonna
happen with HTC like buy they didn't buy
the whole company they bought part of it
but like I don't know it's gonna be
interesting to see whether it actually
saves them or not right I love HTC I
kind of have an emotional connection to
them because they're did you ever see
that original commercial with like with
the we are you and you and you and the
piano I like that commercial probably
from a PR firm I first Android phone was
an HTC okay now speaking of the feels
from when you were a kid this original
article is from bbc.com
Toys R Us
files for bankruptcy protection in the
US and Canada damn Wow 64 6 what 64,000
employees they have those funny
bursaries are us I think they're in the
whole four billion four billion I do it
guys can we raise if every person on
earth legitimately every single one of
them we need is contributed 50 cents
we need a Sarah McLachlan commercial
yeah guys look in the eyes of this
Batman action figure so a u.s.
bankruptcy judge approved a loan of more
than two billion to help stabilize the
toy chain and I mean I love Toys R Us as
much as anyone but why is anybody giving
gigantic big-box retail chains billion
dollar loans I was gonna say this is
just another Amazon created corpse mmm
right like Amazon just murdered this
company yeah yep I mean would you lend
them two billion dollars no I'd have to
get two billion dollars first
the fact that they oh you know two
billion dollars tells us everything we
need to know about how the business is
going billions I mean the stuff they
sell is like 30 bucks well I don't know
lego min okay that's true
it was expensive yeah so in 2016 about
13.7 percent of all toy sales were
online and that's up six and a half
percent from five years ago
that's in 2016 that's last year in
countries where Amazon is not as big so
the UK the EU in general Asia not
included in the bankruptcy really so
it's just countries where Amazon is big
because I wonder who killed Toys R Us
this is the thing about the the rise of
Amazon it's like you know I just and was
saying she can order something and have
it arrive in 15 minutes we don't have
that luxury but you know but it's like
it's yeah p.m. but but even here it's
like a couple days as long as it's got
Prime we have a lot less prime selection
but like I definitely get my money's
worth oh that's fine that's for free
shipping if you want to pay for it you
can get it by 9:00 p.m. same day yeah up
to you as long as you order before I
think it's 11:00 a.m. Hearst and it's
just like it's actually more it takes
less time like out of my life
bison by an order of magnitude oh yeah
to where I just like I like if we're
gonna give but if my kids have a stupid
birthday party to go to
I've just got Amazon top selling toys
find something that doesn't look like
plastic garbage order it and don't think
about it anymore because my wife will
wrap it and also you don't have to feel
like kind of a weirdo walking into a toy
store as a grown adult you know like
this is for this isn't for me it's for
my friend this is my friend this is my
friend with a pedo stache yeah
yeah I think yeah you got your speedo
stash was great but I want to bring it
back you should bring back every time I
shave I just shave the whole thing and
forget that I'm like oh yeah once - you
gotta bring you know what if you want to
remember just take a big sharpie and
just draw on here and then you'll see it
until it grows over and it'll look
basically the same yeah hey it'll remind
you it's it's it's almost mainstream now
it's - you know when I had it yeah yeah
it's like now you see a guy with
moustache you're like no all right so
last topic of the day this could change
memes forever hmm Pepe the frogs creator
boy gets legal against the alt-right so
yes the creator Matt theory and his
lawyers have taken legal action against
the alt-right serving cease and desist
orders to several alt-right
personalities and websites including
Richard Spencer and Mike Serna vich so
Spencer Pepe is all over his site and
the mascot for his podcast
all right politics and for certain of it
he used a 3d version of Pepe dancing
with Hillary Clinton reading aloud
sections of her new book he's also
served a cease and desist against our
slash the Donald and as someone who has
tried to contact reddit about the
content on their site before I can I can
say that's probably not going anywhere
really really good at just ignoring
they've also issued DMCA takedown
requests to Reddit Amazon YouTube and
Twitter notifying them that use of Pepe
by the alt-right on their platforms is
copyright infringement and at the end of
August
Jerry's lawyers actually reached a
settlement with Eric Houser who
appropriated peppe's image for use in an
Islamophobic children's book so they
forced him to stop selling the book and
made him donate the profits to the
Council on american-islamic relations
apparently Google Play has stopped
selling build the wall of the game
because of advertising with special
guest appearances from PayPal that's
what really Apple has previously Apple
had refused to publish the game until it
removed pip
the frog and Apple has a blanket ban
against Peppa the frog that it has
enforcing its multiple app creators this
is fit fascinating because it kind of
opens up a conversation about who owns
memes yes like memes have kind of
existed as a sort of like oh it's a
great tribute 'add content that kind of
arose from the internet sort of
organically so it's like if you make a
meme and it becomes a meme do you own
the copyright and and the answer until
now though I don't to my knowledge this
hasn't been like seriously literally
that's a question I think you absolutely
do right you got a lot of the time it's
derivative but not derivative enough you
didn't create anything you captioned it
in a lot of cases right and the caption
is often part of the original creation
and and it has never been enforced no to
this kind of a degree now to be clear it
looks like Matt theory is only going
after the alt right here mm-hmm but if
he wins a bunch of these battles if he
wins a battle against reddit imagine he
wins against reddit there's some there's
some problems though if he only goes
after the outright yeah that would mean
that he's doing it because he doesn't
like how very specific people are using
it exact thing that's a way that you can
defend it also he let it happen for so
long I think that hurts his case a lot
that he probably won't be able to defend
it anymore because he seemed okay with
it I think we've even talked on the LAN
show about how at one point in time he
was just like maybe the Frog is just a
thing man it was like the most stoned
statement I've ever read it's the Frog I
remember that I don't quite a while ago
but it was like a very like everyone
just gets to co-exist and just Pepe the
Frog also taking a bunch of crap for it
yeah very likely I mean what it's been
so long and that statement came out and
if there's a statement saying sure you
can use it he's basically screwed the
obvious parallel here is but as to the
pewdiepie situation where he is
Firewatch developer goes and as a DMCA
takedown specifically of pewdiepies
Firewatch content because they didn't
agree with how
you know with and there's a similar
problem there which is probably why
you're bringing this up but on fire
washes website there's a specific yes
you can use this for streaming and video
creation and you can monetize it and
like it that one's a little bit more
direct the fire watch one is that's very
black and I'm not even 100% sure about
the pepper the frog one it was from a
while ago and I think it was pretty
vague anyways yeah but if there's a
confirm that you can use it like right I
mean to be fair is is the question
whether he's old he like he's justified
in doing this because I think he is yeah
I don't think that's the question I
think the question of whether well like
legally yeah he's justified he'll win
I'm talking about whether I think he'll
win right whether he's justified in
doing this is not the debate for sure if
someone creates an image it belongs to
them right and people can't use it
without permission but what the
discussion is is around the fact that
this has always been this gray area yeah
and now we're opening up this can of
worms that goes okay if people are gonna
start defending their memes then are we
gonna kill means I don't I think there
will still definitely be some I think
there's definitely still gonna be some
like freeware memes and I bet you
there'll be like a reddit community
around like anything posted in here if
it is OSI has some license like the
public memeing license where everyone is
allowed to use it forever and then
people are gonna start creating memes
out of stuff that comes out of there and
then memes will be saved
I think I'll let you that will happen if
this like goes through I bet no no the
internet would would rally around memes
imager and reddit would get before chen2
they're all these big sites they're all
gonna get behind me let's just let's
bring back a bombs world over yeah I
mean for this to for this to be the
death of me Mars every meme creator
- yeah go after copyright for like their
memes right so which I don't think yeah
I don't think that generally people who
are responsible for creating these kind
of things I would be a lot more hesitant
to use them though if you if anyone had
won a legal fight ever mmm
as an individual I might just yellow it
but as a business individual you before
how does fair use play into that because
like if you take a meme and you're like
okay I'm gonna make a copy this meme and
put your like block text caption on it
that's not I mean that's technically
parody it's technically commercial use
it stuff yeah yeah yeah well if it's
commercial use especially when there was
the exact same font usually on the
previous one yeah I don't think you'd
get away with that yeah right I think
you'd have to change the core of the
image yeah alright so that's pretty much
it for the land show for today thank you
