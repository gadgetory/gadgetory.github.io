between your Android device and your PC
click now to learn more so the funny
thing about that I'm holding a slate
right now click is that I've actually
been working on building this computer
since before we even had any practices
like slating or I had my own company and
a staff of people all for the sake of
making YouTube videos about computers
and the irony there I guess is that
we've been doing this professionally all
this time and I still can't manage to
actually build my own computer and
complete it it's been mostly done for a
while but there were some delays in
releasing the video because the LED
strips on using these are phobia UV LED
slips there are strips they're actually
fairly unique most of the LEDs on my
original strips actually failed so we
weren't going to be able to film it very
well so I finally gotten around to
swapping them out with some brand new
ones and we are ready to take you guys
on a tour of my personal rig so we'll
start with the component selection the
CPU is a 49 60 X I don't really
recommend extreme additions though
really what I recommend is 4770k if you
need hyper-threading 45 70 K if you're
just gaming for threads is enough and
then if you're doing content creation or
any kind of professional work where you
can really leverage additional course 49
30 K those are the three CPUs that are
like really the high performance options
within Intel's lineup for the RAM I'm
using Crucial Ballistix tracer this is
actually an early revision of the memory
that's not really compatible with the X
79 platform at all and has all kinds of
problems unless I run into extremely
lose timings and it's all like crappy I
have better Ram
there's definitely Ram that will work
better with my board but for the sheer
bling factor I did go with this stuff
it's not perfect and it's funny because
like crutial has a utility so you can
program the LEDs on it now by default
they're going to be activity LEDs so
they'll flash slowly if you're not doing
much and then the flash will be fast if
you're doing something really in 10
so intensive but you can configure them
to do all kinds of different patterns
and stuff
unfortunately crucial is missing two
crucial
patterns and that is off and solid I
don't really want them to flash like
this what I would like is to have the
under glow one solid the way that they
are and I would like to actually turn
the top ones off because I find them a
little bit over-the-top but I'm still
going to stick with them anyway for the
motherboard I've got a Seuss's
workstation class LGA 2011 board this is
the new Ivy bridge-e compatible model P
9 X 79 EWS so the e is the new part the
reason I went with the workstation class
motherboard is I'm just so sick of
consumer-grade stuff just not really
working right it feels like the more
features anyone tries to add to
something it's like this router has like
beam technology like focuses your you
know antennas like a dish where your
laptop is like I just want something
that's a workhorse workstation grade and
this one does it it's got the
overclocking stuff it's got a decent
audio codec it's got USB 3 like it's not
a server board where it's like green PCB
and like 2 USB ports at the back but
it's it's also not over the top with
like OC panels this and voltage check
points that just plain works absolutely
love the board it also has tons of PCI
Express expansion I wasn't sure at the
time of originally planning this build
if I was going to go SLI so that would
take up 4 of the slots and then at the
time I was using a sound card it's
actually still in there but I don't
actually use it anymore so I was using a
sound card I wanted a 10 gigabit NIC
which I have pulled out now because I
don't have a 10 gigabit switch at my
house anymore and finally I have a raid
card on the rig as well so I wanted
seven PCI Express slots so that's
another reason to go with a workstation
class board like this it is a little bit
on the wider side which is kind of funny
because when I was cutting the hole in
the motherboard tray for my 24-pin
connector to wrap around i had to
position it as if i might someday put a
regular ATX board in and it still won't
show and be ugly so I had to like
squeeze those cables to get them out
around
the edge of the motherboard because it
actually goes over the the hole that I
cut on the motherboard tray for the GPU
I'm running a GTX Titan my original
graphics card solution was a 590 or I
was thinking about going Quad SLI with
five 90s but Quad SLI just really
doesn't make any sense to me it doesn't
scale particularly well unless you're
running at very very high resolutions
and it introduces some driver issues
that there's just no real solution for
other than to turn off SLI and if I'm
going to put four GPUs in my system
we're talking like a couple thousand
dollars worth of gear I better be using
it all the time where I'm just not going
to put it in so the only reason I
upgraded from the 590 which is actually
a faster card than the GTX Titan in
terms of raw performance was that I
really wanted gamestream for my Nvidia
shield so that I could stream to myself
and you have to have a Kepler based GPU
for that to work so the Titan ended up
in here because we didn't have
duplicates of any other graphics cards
we had two titans so I was like okay the
one Kepler that I can actually grab
happens to be a Titan so I threw that in
there we also had a water block for it
from coolants that is absolutely
beautiful so that was why I went with
that I'll talk more about the water
cooling after for the power supply I
have an XFX thousand watt 80 + Platinum
modular power supply that I sleeved
myself I didn't do a great job of thus
leaving you can do much better if you
individually sleeve each one I am using
murder our MD PCX sleeving or whatever
that stuff is I got it from Charles for
murder box so I'm using really good
sleeving but I did it a little bit
differently than most people instead of
doing each individual wire I actually
did each sleeve over two wires so you
can't get quite as close to the
connector this way but I actually find
it looks a little bit cleaner with fewer
wires and it did make the the cables
less bulky when I was trying to route
them around inside which was important
as you're going to see when I show you
the cable management at the back and how
difficult that was the reason I went
with this power supply this is what like
the only reason was that it was based on
the same platform as see Sonic's
thousand watt platinum and that was the
first power supply that had the zero
decibel fan feature so that the the
power supply actually only turns on its
fan when you get to I think it's around
twenty to thirty percent load so most of
the time that fan actually
doesn't even spin speaking of fans that
don't even spin my fan controllers and M
cubed T balancer that's strapped on the
back I'll show you that more later but
on this side there are four fans on the
quad radiator in the bottom that's an
old thermal chill PA one twenty point
four not quite classic thermal chill
it's got the 15 mil spacing but it's
still thermo chill so it's like old
school water cooling high-end junk so
there's four down there those winds spin
all the time then there's two on a
hardware labs black ice Pro that is a
pretty ancient radiator in the front
that's actually my first water cooling
radiator first want to ever bought with
my apogee block and I think I just did
my CPU the first time I picked up an MCP
350 pump way back then and that ended up
failing at some point I think I don't
really like those half-height pumps the
mCP the DDC series not a big fan of
using a d5 now so that one's hidden in
the basements got the janky entire
bration mount ever where actually it
just has a little like rubber sleeved
wire between it and the side panel so
that it doesn't pass any vibration to
the case so I've got a black ice Pro in
the front that has two fans that aren't
spinning and then you may have actually
noticed that the two fans in the back
here are also not spinning the two on
the top do scan all the time so the M
cube t balancer takes care of that so
when the system is just running at the
desktop or a web browsing most of the
fans in it are actually off and then the
other ones are running extremely low
speeds and then as soon as I ramped up
speeds everything kicks into high gear
so I have 2 temperature sensors one at
the top of the motherboard and then one
that is actually taped with thermal
compound between it and the bottom
radiator in place so that I can monitor
water temperatures and air temperatures
within the case and the appropriate fans
react accordingly whenever those
temperatures increase so I don't
remember I was going with that so raid
card that's an LSI 9268 I at the time
that was an extremely high-end card and
it was optimized for maximum throughput
on large SSD raid 0 arrays which brings
us to my SSD arrangement I might not
show these to you guys yet but there are
eight SSDs around the back of the case
app what the hey we might as well just
like start cracking this baby open so
there are eight Oh
and these are tight with the powder
coating I'll talk about the case after
because the case is quite a story
lots of lots of things altered on that
oh I guess I should talk about the side
panel before we get into the SSDs okay
so the side panel was a nightmare
because I don't like plexi side panels
because they're not really very clear
they're easy to scratch you can put
micro scratches all over a plexi side
panel just by wiping it down with a
microfiber cloth like they're just
terrible
they're very very reflective compared to
glass and they're just not as good but
unfortunately what I wanted was to get
someone to cut a glass panel and very
very carefully drill holes so that I
could actually mount the glass panel on
the back with bolts through the front so
it would be extremely secure they
delivered me a piece of glass with all
the holes drilled but I gave them my
side panel to do the sizing and they a
couple of the holes were actually off on
the glass and you know what they did
they took my side panel not painted yet
fortunately they took my side panel and
just like widened the holes so I was
like oh okay great not only can I not
use this because it's going to look
terrible and the piece of glass broke
when they were drilling the last hole or
whatever so not only have you not
delivered me a useable piece of glass
you've widened the hole on a side panel
that I actually can't replace because
every tj7 is a little bit different and
Silverstone won't even give you a new
side panel because there's a chance that
won't fit with the curvature at the
front so what I ended up having to do
then is a kind of a more ghetto solution
so I just went to a glass shop got a
regular piece of glass and they offered
to use an industrial double-sided tape
to tape it on for me that's how it's
attached then I went to Home Depot I got
a couple little finishing nubbin things
there and I just glued them on so that's
how the side panel works I wish I had a
more sort of glamorous story about that
um what was I talking about
right RAID controller so I guess this
will be my first opportunity to show you
guys the horribleness at the back here
it is an absolute rat's nest back there
and part of it's my fault but part of it
is just that there's a lot of cables
going on back there so that is the eight
drive raid 0 array that powers my
personal machine it is kind of
ridiculous it's
really stupid nobody nobody if people
ask me about my personal machine all the
time and I say just because I'm running
something doesn't mean you should
nobody should run this configuration
that is eighth course Air Force
refurbished SSDs running in raid zero
off of that raid card it is pretty much
going to fail at some point but I do
nightly backups and I keep almost
nothing of substance on it other than
maybe the odd save game here and there
so everything else goes off to an ass so
that's why I have an Intel NIC in here
just for slightly better performance to
the nads it really doesn't make much of
a difference these days especially
because of workstation board like this
has an excellent NIC on it already so
the cable management for that was done
with one of the case modifications that
I had to do which was cutting cable
management holes down at the bottom of
the motherboard tray in addition to the
CPU tray cut out that the T jo7 doesn't
come with natively the 24 pin and 8 pin
and 6 pin for the graphics card cutouts
that are over here on this side as well
as these cable management holes that are
cut into the divider between the top of
the case and the basement just so that I
can get cables up to the top without
using the cable management holes that
are included in that divider because
they're they're quite ugly you can't
really hide the cables there at all so
what kind of performance do I get out of
this and well well over one gigabyte per
second reads and writes so it's
extremely fast I actually changed over
from these SSDs to just a single SSD for
a little while because I don't remember
I was doing some kind of maintenance and
I didn't notice immediately that there
was a difference but then when I went
back to these ones I was like I had
forgotten how fast it was it's actually
really really really fast just again not
something I really recommend I do have
an optical drive in my system something
that a couple of you have probably
noticed by now and the story there is
that I originally added an optical drive
to it because I got a great deal on a
fairly unique item at the time LG did an
HD DVD / blu-ray reading drive it was a
couple hundred bucks but I got it for
like a hundred and it was also a DVD
rewriter and a CD writer I think I'm not
sure if it can yes and wait hold on yeah
so so it records DVDs and CDs and reads
Blu
and HD DVDs and I was like okay this is
the last optical drive I'll ever need
and it turns out I was right
so it's in there so the reason that it's
still in there is because I only sourced
six of these these are original and tech
900 front cage covers and I only sourced
six of them so I didn't have a seventh
to put in even if I did want to take the
optical drive out plus the way that that
front radiator is mounted with just like
a piece of like sticky double sided
velcro thing rolled up under the bottom
so that it like sticks in place and then
velcro on the bottom of the DVD drive
and the radiator stuck to that I can't
really take the optical drive out anyway
so that's why I have one yeah doesn't
think it's not great so the fan
controller I guess I guess I kind of
talked about that already I'll cover a
couple more things about liquid cooling
I'm using bits power truesilver 3/8 inch
ID 5/8 inch OD compressions I think that
3/8 ID 5/8 OD is pretty much the sweet
spot in terms of performance because if
you go lower than that you go down to
like quarter inch tubing you're going to
drop about a degree of performance maybe
two and if you go up to 1/2 it doesn't
really make a difference and then the
advantage of 3/8 over 1/2 is you can get
much tighter Bend radii without kinking
so I really really like thick wall 3/8
inch tubing and then these are the
compressions that go with it the other
thing is that you get better
compatibility by going with 3/8 inch
tubing because half inch compressions
especially if you get thick walls so 3/4
inch OD tubing the compressions to go
but those are huge and they barely fit
on anything so that was why I went that
route this is a t-virus reservoir right
here it's a clear outside and then I my
original one was actually frosted blue
for this for the heel double helix
inside but I are made it and I be kind
of screwed it up they sent me back a
clear when it actually looks just fine
they used to look a little bit better
back when the cathode in there wasn't so
faded out I got to get a new one and get
it replaced but very very cool item you
can get those from frozen q what else ha
yes fans ok you may have also noticed
the complete absence of Noctua fans yes
I'm shallow part of the problem is not
that I don't think Noctua fans can look
good I think they can look good
some machines in fact our upcoming
hackintosh build guide is going to have
Noctua fans in an H for 40 from NZXT and
I think it looks really really sharp in
there but the problem is that it needs
to go with the rest of this system and
it just doesn't so I needed blue fans
and the good news is there are some very
high-quality blue fans available so on
my bottom radiator I'm using the
original silverstone air penetrators I
think they're a p1 21s or something like
that so what's great about those is they
take your airflow and they turn them
into kind of a like a cyclone like a
funnel of air away from them and because
the basement here only has this intake
on the rad which is by the way mounted
with Velcro just on the bottom so takes
the airflow through and then I want it
to push it out the other side but
there's nothing kind of containing that
airflow because this is this is quite
open so I wanted something that is able
to direct airflow like that so that's
why I went with those there and then for
everything that's visible up here in the
top I'm using gelid wings because they
undervolt quite gracefully
they're easy to clean you can actually
pop the blades right off them if you
want to clean them which is quite ok I'm
not going to do it now but that's quite
nice and they're reasonably quiet even
at load they also come with really nice
rubber grommets so it was quite a chore
to do this one but the rubber grommets
are installed on the back ones and then
the one on the inside where normally in
the TJ o 7 you slide the fans in and
then screw them in I had to get the fans
inside to actually Bend that cage open
force the fans in somehow thread all the
little rubber grommets through and then
Bend the cage back shut I'd cut my hands
every time I've had to do that and cable
managing is kind of a nightmare as well
because there's only a little tiny like
gap left where you can slip a wire
through it
ha liquid cooling components I think
that's pretty much it for the water oh
yes that's not it so the sort of the the
centerpiece of this rig is an Apogee gtz
from Swift tech that is the gold plated
limited edition of it I got number 169 I
also had it altered a little bit so the
hold down plate is normally just I think
it's more of a flat powder coat but I've
got Mountain Monza's black Winkle powder
coat which matches the outside of the
case put on there
after markets I figured if I'm sending
in the case I might as well send in that
piece too the only thing in here that I
could have powder-coated I think that I
didn't is the casing for the optical
drive that I just spray-painted it still
kind of bothers me when I look at it but
not that huge of a deal I guess and then
I already mentioned the mCP 655 or d5
pump in the bottom I do really recommend
if you're going to go with a d5 pump
that you go with the variable speed one
not only does it go back to a higher rpm
than the fixed one which is fixed at
about four out of five of the variable
one but when you turn it down all the
way I keep mine all the way down you're
only going to lose a couple degrees to a
few degrees of temperatures and it is
extremely quiet it's one of the people
talked about this all the time it drives
me crazy like the internet doesn't know
silent silent is silent and not silent
is not silent MCP 350s are not silent DD
C's are not silent at all they're loud
and this one when you turn it down is
legitimately extremely quiet almost
silent I mean my mics on my chest here
that's what my rig sounds like nothing
that is satisfactory anything else is
not silent so there's that um I think
that's pretty much it for like the
component choices so let's talk about
the case the origin of this case and had
a lot of people ask me why do you why do
you use that tj7 that thing is ancient
and you're right it was a gift from my
wife way back when we were dating it was
the first big ticket item present that
she ever bought me so there's some
sentimental value there and then there's
also the fact that I personally don't
think a better case has been made yet
and better is a subjective word it means
different things to different people to
me better means a combination of a lot
of things it means the design it means
the build quality it means the
craftsmanship that went into it are
there cases with better features than
this one that are perhaps more
water-cooling friendly you don't have to
mount your front radiator with velcro
and your bottom radiator with well also
velcro yes there are better cases in
terms of features these days but the the
feet the manufacturing feet of this
single unibody piece that goes all the
way
from the back of the top to the back of
the bottom and is a single thick piece
of aluminum has not been replicated
since the TJ o7 except by the TJ 11
which I have a whole set of problems
with aside from it being too big for me
I just don't find it as I don't find it
as space efficient as the TJ o7 I don't
want anything bigger I mean this thing
already weighs 59 pounds full of
hardware I don't need anything any
bigger or any heavier so that's that's
my that's my whole thing there so the
craftsmanship of it is something that I
really appreciate I don't really like
plastic if I don't have to use it and
the other thing is why would I need to
upgrade I've had a lot of people tell me
why don't you go to switch 810 well
because the switch 810 is plastic for
one thing and for two I think it's
pretty gaudy looking whereas this is a
more a very clean very classical look
and it fits all the hardware I need
people like oh the switch 810 fits this
in this I don't care I'm running one
graphics card it's sort of normally ATX
board I don't have an XL ATX board I
have six fans six 120 millimeter fans
worth of radiator to cool a GPU and a
CPU like that's it so it's already
extremely silent what do I need more for
so then II way that's why I still the
tj7 there are some things where people
have a good point that I've spent way
too much on this TJ o7 I mean back in
like my first build that I didn't it
where I really wanted to like go crazy
on it I wanted to get the mid plate
actually polished so it's like a raw
aluminum stock and I wanted to get it
polished to a mirror shine I'd seen it
done before and it looked really really
good so the place I took it to to get
that done they completely screwed it up
they made a total mess of it and it was
like completely unusable so that was the
point where I was like okay well I will
have to powder coat the interior so I
went to mountain mods I got them to
powder coat the interior this was all
like the first time the outside still
had the very beautiful stock anodized
aluminum finish on it so when that got
beat up and it was time to redo the
build anyway and I was going to tear the
whole thing apart that's another thing
that's great about the t07 again
features that aren't on a spec sheet it
can be taken apart completely it is
assembled with screws not with rivets so
but when it came time to take it apart
again I was like okay I'm going to send
the whole thing away I want to get it
powder
coded for the outside but the inside was
all beat up from upgrading hardware and
you know dinging it and stuff like that
so I started looking into how to get
powder coating stripped Oh extremely
expensive involves like chemical baths
and there's like no guarantees that the
parts leave and make it so I took a
gamble they came out okay but I think it
cost me a couple hundred bucks like it
was ridiculous but only there's so one
of these PCI screws it's not really
threaded anymore I just have like some
Loctite in there so that it stays and
then other than that it survived the the
chemical bath pretty well so I sent it
away to mountain mods to be coated again
and other than one screw up on the right
side panel which looks pretty ugly it
actually came out really really well I
think they're black wrinkle finish is
one of the most beautiful powder coating
finishes available it's actually uses
quite a glossy paint but then there's so
much texture to the finish that the
light scatters really well and it ends
up having more like a net matte effect
anyway so that that cost me another I
don't know 150 bucks remember like that
and people kind of look at and go well
you could have just bought yourself a
new case because you powder-coated it
once strip the powder coating off powder
coated it again I'm just like yeah
you're probably right but you can't
achieve this case with the changes that
I've made to it including the cable
management in the back and well mostly
the cable management in the back is so
low that I really added to it without
buying a TG l7 and getting it powder
coated anyway so buying a new TG o7
still cost like 350 or 400 bucks or
whatever so there you go I might as well
just reuse this one one other change I
did make to the case is the front IO
I've completely done away with the audio
ports because I'm using an objective to
an ode AK now so I don't need the front
audio on my case so all I have in there
is 2 USB 3 ports which is something that
the case doesn't come with by default
this little off this little door right
here is actually kind of a funny story
once I had the case painted the build-up
of the paint made it so that the stock
magnet wasn't strong enough to attract
the door and cause it to close that we
just fall open so I had to send down the
powder coating on the steel piece inside
the door and then I had to go steal a
fridge magnet that had a rare-earth
magnet in it was one of those cute
little like like bulletin board tack
ones that has a rare-earth magnet in it
so I just like cut that
thing open and then steal the magnet out
of it and then the mega it was too big
to fit so I had to like file it down and
like superglue it in there and that's
the only reason that front door closes
so that was a that was pretty janky um
front days are just mounted with like
wood screws basically there's a lot of
things that are super and perfect about
the machine but I think that's part of
what gives it character right let's talk
Oh cable management at the back so
there's a lot of stuff back here there's
the temp probes that help me control the
fan speeds there's all the fans so every
fan in the system is plugged in in the
back on the back here somehow so I think
down here I have handmade adapters so
that all four fans on the bottom
radiator can be combined into a single
lead to come up to the top up here and
then everything else kind of runs back
here as well the tea balancers something
I get asked about a lot it's a real bear
to configure I don't recommend that
people buy it unless they want to fight
with it for probably a good like you
know three to six hours to really get it
working properly but once you do I've
had this thing for a few years now and
I've hardly even touched it so you know
it's great for what it is it's not great
for a lot of the other things that it is
I guess I don't really have too much
else to say I'm just kind of looking at
some of the other sort of notes that I
have for myself so there's some kind of
funny little imperfections and geto
solutions I get asked by quite a few
people how to keep their graphics card
from sagging and the solution that I
managed to come up with is really really
stupid I took like a little piece of
it's a piece of a V checkpoint so it
actually is like a wrapped rubber little
metal piece inside and I jammed it in
between the PCI slot rear like bracket
piece and a DVI port and what that did
is it gave the graphics card a little
bit of extra support so it ends up being
a little bit straighter it's not even it
doesn't make that much of a difference
though and the rear side panel it's
really funny because it's almost
impossible to close so is this like is
this something that Steve Jobs would be
proud of I don't think so but is it
something that serves me extremely well
and has been worth the effort though I
don't know
it serves me well I don't know if it was
worth the effort but I
that pretty much wraps it up that is the
end of personal rig update 2012 and it
is very unlikely that I will be touching
my personal rig any time in the next
probably couple of years other than
maybe a graphics card upgrade that's
something that people ask me about a lot
as well as why'd you go so like ghetto
why are you just using you know regular
primo flex tubing and like curves like
this when the fashion these days is to
use angled fittings and very straight
tubing runs and I love that I think it
looks fantastic but the issue is that
I've always been of a philosophy that
something that's your actual daily
driver rig has to be very easily
upgradable so this approach gives me a
lot more flexibility in terms of if I
want to do a GPU swap I can probably get
a GPU swap done in like I don't know 20
minutes tops and whereas if you have
like all like hard piping tubing it's
pretty much impossible it's a real
nightmare like I can just like take my
CPU block off I can do a CPU swap in
like eight minutes so stuff like that
making sure that the system is
upgradable and something that I can
continue to add to in the future is
something that I've always kind of
thought about as I've built up this
machine although I think now we've
reached the point where I'm really not
going to make too many changes to it
other than when star citizen launches
I'll be putting in at whatever makes
sense at that point we'll see how things
shake down with mantle and directx12 and
whatever graphics card ends up going in
there that's pretty much it guys sorry
for the super long video like it if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment and let me know if you
have anything to say about the rig
obviously I'll be reading the comments
pretty carefully on something that's you
know about my own sort of pride and joy
here don't forget you can support Linus
media group by contributing to us
monthly to allow me to build more
computers like this evidently actually
it's funny I should okay before I finish
the video I'll tell you guys which ones
are samples and which ones I actually
legitimately paid for so you can do that
you can buy t-shirts you can change your
M sorry my cameraman fell asleep at the
wheel over there so the you know SD card
got all filled up because he made that
last shot takes so long so I was just
going to say as always guys thank you
for
watching and don't forget to subscribe
and then now I don't even remember the
story I was gonna tell what was it oh
yeah oh yeah which stuff which stuff
like legitimately paid for and which
stuff with samples okay so we'll go
through part by part the case has cost
me a grand total of and my minal wife so
because it was bought initially has cost
like easily about a thousand dollars up
till now like but when you consider that
it's made it through quite a few builds
and that's been over a span of like five
years now or however long it's been four
or five years it's like buying a new
really nice case every year I guess so I
could justify that to myself ah the
radiator in the front like I said was
part of my very first water cooling
setup the optical drive I bought the
t-virus reservoir I'm just trying to
remember nope that was a sample so I did
that one as a that was an unboxing the
motherboard itself was a sample for
masseuse the RAM came from crucial the
CPU again I would not recommend running
an extreme Edition unless you get them
as like an engineering sample and you
don't have anything else to do with them
and you throw them in your rig the
waterblock that that Apogee I actually
had Swift tech offer to send me one of
these limited edition which they only
did 200 of them gold-plated and I was
like nope Gabe I can't do that I have to
buy it
I must buy it because otherwise I won't
feel worthy to own such a very very cool
piece of computer hardware so I paid for
the CPU block all the fittings as well
those are really expensive the
truesilver fittings the Titan and the
coolants block were things that we used
for a video and then the the Sennheiser
sound card that came with that came as
like a bundle with a headset for my wife
the raid card yeah that was that was my
problem and then the SSDs who spent a
brand on those that was one of the
biggest computer purchases I've ever
made was buying all those eight SSDs at
once but it was a really good deal like
to this day it still holds up pretty
well from a price to performance
standpoint this whole solution so it was
about 1500 total or so because I was
able to get those drives for under $1
per gig because
like a crazy reefer blow out this is
back in San force one days getting them
under $1 per gig it was a really good
deal so I was like ok this is my
opportunity I'm gonna get my ultimate
SSD set up nine hundred gigs SSD super
fast I went for it so it's like crazy
balls this radiator was a purchase those
fans were purchased the XFX power supply
was a sample so but I would have bought
one if I wasn't able to get one
otherwise but don't tell XFX that and I
think that pretty much wraps it up so
there you go guys the benefits of being
a youtuber yes you do get a bunch of
samples which is really really cool but
oh I bought the tea balancer as well but
it also forces you to like buy other
stuff to go with it well it doesn't
force you but it you know yeah and it's
like getting a job somewhere where you
have like a great staff discount you end
up spending more there even though you
have your staff discount than you would
have if you just didn't work there and
didn't go there every day so alright I
think I'm done now yes I'm done
