2017 to show us a whole lot of
incredibly cool things so I've got two
demos behind me one of which is for
Radeon Pro SSG graphics cards so these
are the ones with the like one terabyte
of sort of SSD cache on them which
they've got running in raid four four
terabytes they're working with a 200
gigabyte data set and they are rendering
a photorealistic 4k image in damn near
real-time to put it in perspective a
top-end workstation working with that
would be doing like one frame every five
seconds but I know most of you guys are
not into photorealistic image rendering
as much as you're into gaming and that's
where this demo comes in this right here
is doom at 4k Ultra settings I actually
had to use some console commands in
order to do it because they disabled
escape but they're like yes we are
running ultra settings and it turns out
it is indeed true tsaa times 8 3840 by
2160 vulcan ultra it is the real deal
right here running at rock-solid over
60fps on an undisclosed named Vega GPU
so there's for real pillars for Vega
there's the new cache architecture which
allows games to start using gigabytes or
even terabyte scale data sets there's
the new geometry pipeline which allows
for an incredible number of polygons
there's the new compute engine which
they're calling NC you for next compute
unit so that's pretty cool but basically
16-bit data types are becoming super
important for HDR in particular which is
going to be one of the next big image
quality improvements in gaming and
finally there's a new pixel engine so
they're calling it the draw stream
binning rasterizer this cuts down on
unnecessary memory fetches so say for
example in a game like doom normally the
way the game is designed you would
actually waste memory bandwidth drawing
stuff that's behind the rocket launcher
that is not going to be the case with
this new approach and it won't require
gains to be rewritten
either which is pretty freaking cool
they're not discussing price point
they're not discussing when it's
shipping other than sometime in the
first half of 2017 but what they did let
me do is they did let me hold one which
is pretty freakin amazing and they have
also allowed us to take the side panel
off of the machine giving us our first
look at running operating Rison and vega
hardware working together now I want to
make it very very abundantly clear that
the finished design will not have gaffer
tape on it that is there so that AMD
doesn't have all the you know bathroom
engineers sitting on the can with their
calculators on their phones figuring out
things like power draw for a product
that is potentially up to six months
away because it's not done yet as if the
you know three inch you know EP an
extension on the back with a USB 3 port
on it wasn't enough of an indication on
that subject a USB 3 port on the inside
of a graphics card I think I'm gonna
have to bring in an expert to explain to
me why exactly we need one of those and
what AMD is doing over here so here he
is the man himself The Dropper of GPUs
here I'll give this out I'm gonna put
that in your pocket for safekeeping not
gonna let you hold it tell me about this
so Salinas this is the stuff that I'm
most excited about on the GPU there are
billions of transistors on the chip that
you just put in my pocket but this kind
of this this this thing is I'm super
excited about this is only on
engineering cards right this is not
you're not going to see it on a product
okay and that's so cool I think I'll
make a special edition for you and for
me like we'll make two cards okay love
that thing but what this does is it
gives every engineer in the company
ability to monitor all the signals most
importantly all power and electrical
signals coming out of the CPU remotely
with no overhead now every engineer
including the guys who test gay
the QA guys everybody inside AMD that
has a Vega can see what's going on at
the detail level that's kind of what
exactly is this in response to some of
the criticism with Polaris's power sort
of you know dropping we definitely you
know want to get better at our you know
power efficiency every generation we're
putting money where our mouth is right
overkill Selena
it's not I mean I think this is really
really cool because I especially
software engineers now they can see what
impact they're having on power in their
you know in their whatever machine that
you know they put a Vega and so that's
kind of you know really cool kind of you
know attachment I didn't expect us to be
talking about that you know I expected
us to be talking about connect you know
all the the full cool new architectural
features and Kenny and our battery died
that was awkward but what's not awkward
is this demo which is pretty freakin
impressive so huge thanks to Roger for
telling us about the power monitoring
huge thanks to AMD for allowing us to be
down here at CES 2017 huge thanks to you
for watching and don't forget to
subscribe for more great videos from CES
