gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more
you are never gonna guess what time it
is what time is it oh it's time to play
find the sausage all right
I mean hide the sausage I actually have
sausage juicing with this okay and
that's unusual because okay so uh here's
your sausage thank you sir
all right so let's do this rule number
one
each sausage hider gets an accomplice in
the form of a camera operator
rule number two sausages must have their
Bluetooth trackers attached at all times
to avoid unfortunate situations like
what happened at one time rule number
three sausages must be hidden where
either participant can safely retrieve
them rule number four inside or outside
the house it's all fair game rule number
five sausages must take no longer than
five minutes to hide and rule number six
no touching the sausages of other
participants until such time as you're
permitted to touch their sausages okay
so I guess we'll start with finding the
blue treats to the sausages so I can do
this so to be clear I find your sausage
and you find my sausage right yeah okay
it's sausage one you touched something
that was in my mouth your sausage well
no my bluetooth dongle I've always loved
the word dongle wait I actually don't
understand which sausage so you are
looking for sausage number two so I have
to hide sausage number two okay all
right so you know the rules
yep five minutes man all right I'm gonna
make a bunch of noise in here and I'm
gonna move stuff around
I don't even know what I'm doing okay
that's good enough that's not convincing
I'm gonna go actually Heidegger between
you and me I have a pretty dastardly
plan for my sausage I'll reveal my my
secret later I don't he says he has a
plan but I think my plan is much more
evil I'm gonna put it under the couch
sausage has been planted
I'm gonna use my extra time to wash my
hands and try to disrupt more things so
he thinks it somewhere else
I'm gonna build a case tower in the
meantime I can show you guys kind of how
this works
where's my sticker oh right I guess I
could I could see how far away he's
going could he die
great your sticker has been found well
he's moving around I can hear moving
around in there he's probably trying to
throw me off that's once empty
someone's also empty I borrowed both of
these sausages from Luke I didn't really
expect him to UM click them my plan is
I'm gonna hide the sausage in my pants
watch the delay so if I move it see that
delay oh yeah so the delay means that if
he's moving around quite quickly and
knowing him he will write like he'll be
running around like a chicken with his
head cut off the fact that I'm moving
around with him but that there's a delay
will mean that it'll be really difficult
for him to pinpoint which of his
movements are causing him to be closer
or further from it so hopefully he looks
there well this body's gonna work
I have to shifters that side of the
house the rural state that it must be
hidden within the top floor mid floor or
back yard I will be in those places and
when I come back I will carefully not
move on to the front porch that way it
never crosses threshold and I never
break the rules
hi duck all right well it's my turn now
yep see you in five minutes or less all
right man I don't trust them he'd locked
it even okay so let's start by like
making some noise I'm not sure if he's
trying to make a distraction or if he's
trying to mock me and start by cleaning
up this sausage here I'm really not sure
about my hiding spot
it relies a lot on him checking that
Tower but then he'll be able to see that
tower right now what can we do about the
signal strength though ah man I'm really
not sure about my idea now cuz he gets
to see it you got to see my Tower you
know what we might just have to I just
have to roll with it okay ready this is
the moment of truth so so this is where
you're hiding it yeah there you go can
hardly tell
all right you ready yep okay let's go so
I got this one
thanks oh yeah smart guy yeah okay so
let's start with this let's start
upstairs I think great your sticker has
been found all right okay well you think
he's doing the same thing I don't know
it has no signal strength percentage at
all
mine's like broken so can i interfere
with you okay I'm allowed to
is it working again oh it's working
again okay Oh what do you mean inter
here for the last two or three minutes
mine said no signal oh well I'm sorry to
hear that your Android phone down there
isn't very good oh I'd say it's the app
what the heck is he walking around with
it they're so confused their minds are
completely blown is he walking around
with it which tells me they probably
didn't do the same thing it seems to be
moot like if I stand right here
she usually indicates it to floor up
can't well back up hold on
colder let's move downstairs I think
it's mine that's alright nope nope nope
nope I have no idea yeah it's trying to
wake up the sticker last I was in here
it says 70% now doesn't say anything
this way we can give them a false
positive because vertically the
detection is actually very good so
they're going to think they're really
close but you can see we're at 96% here
items it which means oh you I've got to
be kidding me
is it smell like sausage in here I don't
think so I get they barricaded it goes
down as I do anything I think this is
just a clever decoy and it's
surprisingly clever given any mental
capacity of those two maybe he hid it in
my boxes
okay I have no clue
not in my computer isn't oh good it's in
the bills I have to pay thank you for
that about it I did now the question is
should we tell them we found it
or should we let them keep looking maybe
we'll hope we'll hold steady in one
place yeah do okay okay um how am I
gonna smuggle this out of here
right do it in the fridge hello okay
signal strength thing here we go
40% ball are you carrying it is it on
you I don't know it's on you isn't it
it's on you coming what what is it is
Tarun carrying it who has it work you
headed
yes you should probably check that
sausage
what is it mine do you find mine and
swap it oh so unfair Oh Oh God Oh God
still have it if you want no no no pass
your decoy was very clever very clever
dude but oh I was so confused on the
Android app there's a delay but the iOS
app is very respond so I figured as long
as we moved past you very quickly you
would move past us and go closer closer
closer
oh it's further now but by then we be
gone so that was why I ever go straight
up though it was it was just saying that
the sticker was on I came in hit over
here that's pretty good
anyway I think we're going Oh God
this was a departure from our normal
style because we thought a simple
unboxing of a product like this wouldn't
be much fun let us know if you liked or
disliked it by clicking those thumbs
below the player the stick and find the
product that we were using for this is
available in a variety of battery life
and range configurations which you can
find by checking out the pricing and
availability link in the video
description the one that we're using is
a 2-pack that uses standard cr2016
batteries one for each of the units it
actually comes with two of them in the
little tags and advertises a 150-foot
range or the battery life of one
year the app we were using in the video
can be used like radar the way we were
using it to find missing things like
keys or pets or it can also be used to
trigger an alarm if something goes too
far from you which is great for
traveling or family outings just stick
it to your luggage kids or anything else
and if they stray beyond the limits you
set the alarm will go off what a smart
little device speaking of smart
