overlooked by a lot of computer users
who you know maybe they're eating at
their desk or maybe they're you know
just leaving their stuff forever and not
not actually cleaning it off very
frequently now okay first of all these
are called keyboard wipes they're from
dust off all right and so the
instructions on the back are for
one-step cleaning so they help keep your
keyboard and other office equipment
clean and dust free keyboard and mouse
telephone fax machine desktop you can
tell this is a little bit of a dated a
dated label since they're talking about
like fax machines and whatnot okay so
you removed the freshness seal locate
end of first wipe in the center of the
roll thread the wipe through the opening
in the lid and do not flush these down

you gotta actually wear right through
that so you can see that it's actually
leaving behind like little little chunk

obviously it would be recommended to use
this a little bit more often then you
know once every 25 years but this
keyboard is definitely well worth well
worth trying to restore okay and
actually we should show you before we
before we stop this video the camera
man's Apple keyboard because that one
came out really really clean and it was
pretty gross too I mean not like this
mind you but okay so there we go we have
restored the spacebar key to something
resembling usable by people all right
and if you look for comparison against
some of the other stuff that is pretty
pretty clean looking so thank you for
checking out my video about keyboard
wipes don't forget to clean
equipment once in a while and oh yeah
cameraman you can come look at your
keyboard if you want or you don't really
have to I guess yeah so there's the
