Sonic 80 plus platinum families guys
bandless 520 watt power supply very very
cool stuff so we're going to go ahead
and get this pretty much sort of opened
up quick fast here with all the
accessories and cool stuff while I
explain how the heck see sonic managed
to produce a power supply that even four
or five years ago would have been as
high-end as it gets in terms of the
wattage that it outputs not only that
but actually I need this for a little
bit longer but crank up the efficiency
to the point where the thing doesn't
even need a fan and they are confident
providing a seven-year warranty to
people to use this thing with no
freaking fan for seven years and
actually have a chance of that happening
well not just chance I'm sure if they're
putting a seven-year warranty on it
their actual mean time between failure
is going to be significantly longer than
that because that's generally how that
works
all right so accessory wise we've got
some screws for mounting we've got some
zip ties for cable management we've got
some velcro ties for cable management a
powered by C Sonic sticker that's fully
modular to owner's manual this power
supply is designed for to be responsible
for its own cooling and functionality
only so guys think about it this way so
sometimes when you have a power supply
and it's got a fan on the top of it and
you have like a passive graphics card
near it you can rely on some of that
incidental airflow to cool your graphics
card this power supply doesn't
contribute to the rest of your systems
cooling in any way so you got to make
sure that if you're building a silent
system you're doing it responsibly and
there's enough overall system airflow
that none of the components are just
going to burn out that's basically what
they're trying to say here next we've
got our commitment to superior quality
with their 24 hour service and their
call-out for the 7 year warranty as well
as sort of where to find your serial
number and all that good stuff so the
PSU itself install with the ventilation
top cover facing up this is common sense
but it's a good thing they say so
someone was going to install it like
this and they were going to have the
heat not actually be able to rise
anywhere so the way this is designed is
for natural convection to take place so
a little bit of air will come in here
and we'll walked out the top of the
power supply and that is how it is
intended to be cooled so we're actually
going to take this off so you can
actually see there's nice tall heat
sinks in there see those ones right by
the side that are near that intake that
I showed you on the side that's how it's
supposed to work it is designed for that
if you run this in a configuration other
than what they're recommending like if
you were to run it on its side I'm sure
see sonic would kind of give you the
please don't do that because that might
explode things sort of speech so make
sure you run it this way on the back you
find your standard honeycomb ventilation
in fact this whole power supply is
basically honeycomb ventilation see that
more there more there there's the fully
modular power supply so let's go ahead
alright power supplies I have the fully
modular interface so let's go ahead and
have a look at what we've got included
in terms of cables it looks like they
give you a lot of options because we
have a big cable pack considering that
this is a 520 watt power supply here we
go so we've got this is a dual Bolex I'm
going to put them over there
here's a molex to floppy adapter just in
case you need one of those there's a
triple molex harness there's a quad SATA
harness and the dual SATA harness that's
actually a pretty good mix and then I
suspect in the other one we're going to
find things like 24 pin PCIe and
Aitken which happens to be exactly what
we're going to find there so there you
go there's your 24 pin beautifully
sleeved all black cables love to see
that and then there is an eight pin
that's a breakaway four plus four look
at that a ribbon cable eight pin
gorgeous I don't know if I've seen that
before
and then finally two ribbon cable power
supply six plus two s so the only one
that's actually sleeved here is the 24
pin and even that one uses gorgeous
leaving and all black cables so this
will look extremely clean in your case
no matter what you install now they
actually include more options here then
you actually can can fully utilize I
think oh wait no no they don't you can
plug in all of the modular cables alone
two SATA three molex two malenque and
they'll go in but they've got an extra
one for CPU slash PCIe so it's possible
if you contacted C sonic and asked them
for you know yet a board that has two
eight pins or something like that or you
had a single video card that has three
six or three eight pins they might be
able to send you another one so this is
for your 24 there's your rate there's
your auxiliary and there's your PCI
Express now let's see if we missed
anything so alright my suspicion for how
they did this right because I don't know
if you guys know this but C sonic has a
thousand watt unit that doesn't even
turn on the fan until fifty percent so
if you do sort of the rough mental math
that's about 500 watts so I suspect when
you buy this the price is going to be
pretty high and what you're actually
getting is probably a much much beefier
power supply that is just sort of scaled
down so that they can run it without a
fan however the advantage of buying this
versus just buying the thousand watt is
that this one is going to get the proper
efficiency at the kind of system loads
that you're going to be using it with so
when you run a thousand watt power
supply at you know 200 Watts under load
with your system because you have a
power silence optimized system you're
actually getting like the worst possible
efficiency on that curve which they
conveniently do not have on this box but
on the efficiency curve which basically
goes not a very efficient very very very
efficient and then kind of tails down
like that so you're better off to run a
lower wattage power supply
you're not going to use the full
capacity of it patented DC connector
panel with integrated voltage regulation
so basically what they're trying to say
here it was 105 degrees Celsius Japanese
caps solid cap seven your everything is
just sort of the bomb I love see sonic
power supplies
people ask me sort of what's a good
power supply to buy a very safe answer
see sonic good stuff don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips from our boxing's
reviews and other computer videos and
thank you so much for watching and we
miss something there's a little creek
inside here see there's your power cable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
