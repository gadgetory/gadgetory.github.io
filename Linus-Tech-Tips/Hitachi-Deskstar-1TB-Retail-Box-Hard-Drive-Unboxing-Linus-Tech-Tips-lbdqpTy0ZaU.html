NCIX tech tips topic that I'm gonna be
working on soon I'm gonna actually be
doing thanks to heat a Qi actually big
thanks to Itachi for providing us with
the drives for this topic but we are
finally after many many many requests
going to be doing in NCIX tech tips on
configuring raid so I'm going to be
using the hitachi desk star three and a
half inch drive this is a 7200 rpm drive
with 32 Meg's of cash I have three
drives in one terabyte capacity so I'm
going to be showing raid 0 raid 1 as
well as raid 5 ok this is their HD 3100
series drive so this is their latest
series of drives and I'm gonna go ahead
and open the box now this is I think the
first time I've ever actually unboxed a
retail box hard drive because mostly
NCIX where I work being an online store
we don't really stock a whole lot of
retail box hard drives because it's a
lot easier to just ship a drive than to
ship a big box so here is the packaging
that it comes in clever little plastic
then we have Wow a hard drive
installation guide I have never seen one
of these before
so they show you how to connect the SATA
power and SATA data you can record your
drive information in here if you want to
talk talks about Hitachi's warranty so
Hitachi has a pen says a one-year
two-year three-year or five-year so I
don't know which one it is
for this particular drive but lets you
know let's see if we can figure that out
real quick hold on I can be complicated
this Drive has a three-year warranty it
is green eco-friendly technology for
industry-leading low power consumption
ok so this is a eco-friendly Drive as
well you've got 4 hard drive screws for
installing the drive in your case you
have a SATA cable for installing the
drive in through your motherboard and
then here is the other side of the
little plastic clamshell that holds the
drive now Hitachi drives come in
particularly shiny anti-static bags that
are also moisture barrier bags and
there's our completely sealed
whereas Seagate just folds over a bag
and then put the sticker on it as
at all so you actually have to tear it
open and you will find do not eat gel
silica gel don't eat it and then you
will find a hard drive so here's the
Hitachi one terabyte hard drive that we
are unboxing today it is also quite
shiny you can see the label up close in
HD if you'd like don't forget to set
your your YouTube to HD so you can see
that label and all its labeled glory and
then you can flip it over and you can
see the controller um totally made by
LSI interesting didn't know that you can
see cash you can see some other stuff
you can see these SATA 2 interface so
this is a SATA 2 Drive
so there's your power there's your data
and it's a three and a half inch drive
so it uses your standard one two three
or one two configuration for mounting it
to your case so it's compatible with
pretty much any case out there thank you
for checking out my unboxing and I'm
sorry for this incredibly pointless
unboxing but I have a much better topic
coming up so stay tuned and it will all
be worth it don't forget to subscribe to
both a Linus tech tips as well as NCIX
