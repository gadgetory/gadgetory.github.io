we really need more quiet PC case
options and cooler masters answer to
that it was yes we have the Silencio 652
s and we will send it to you please do a
review please and all I could really say
to that is okay I guess so
and while I'm randomly guessing at
things I guess my review the LGG watch R
is going to be coming soon so stay tuned
for that but first this video cooler
masters case mod world series is your
opportunity to show off your modding
skills and win great prizes entries
close February 7th 2015 click now to
learn more we'll start with a look at
the outside I quite like the aesthetic
of this case the front door is hard to
even see that it's a door it blends in
with the front of the case really well
and Coolermaster just overall hasn't
attempted to reinvent the already fairly
functional wheel of quiet cases with
simple elegant looks but has managed
their own unique spin that makes this
more than a me-too product the front
door is lined with noise dampening
materials and reveals three five and a
quarter inch bays underneath and a
removable cover for the two included 120
millimeter Silencio Series quiet fans
and some rather curious design choices
first I noticed that the bay covers and
fan cover have a plastic patterned layer
and another plastic mesh layer that
gives them a very pleasing appearance
but they both lack dust filters a bit of
a given on mid-range too high in cases
these days
next I noticed that they might not need
to be filtered anyway since the front
door includes no gaps to allow air to be
drawn in through the front of the case
which means that for any filtration
scheme to work it would actually have to
cover the side vents on the front bezel
so the third oddity I noticed then was
that these also don't include any
filters so the overall impression of the
front is that it looks really good but
leaves the primary air intake for the
case completely open to infiltration by
dust a design oversight that is
particularly confusing when Coolermaster
went to the trouble to filter the bottom
of the case where only the power supply
takes in
by default let's move on though io is
well laid out with anything vulnerable
to being stepped on by a cat-like power
and reset buttons on the front and
everything else that is dual USB to dual
USB 3.0 headphone and microphone and
this is a really nice touch an SD card
reader on the top also on the top is a
vent exposure mechanism that feels a lot
less like a bolted on afterthought than
most silent cases looking at you define
our v and from everywhere but the back
appears to be just a stylized top panel
very nice
from the back though we can see that
there are two sliding pieces that lock
into place well yet are easy to remove
if you know what to do the first one is
a solid plastic layer that leaves the
top looking stylish ly well vented just
like the front when you open the door
and there's a second one that reveals
easy mounting for top fan so that's up
to to 140 millimeter fans or a dual 120
millimeter radiator with fans the side
panels use standard non captive thumb
screws so be careful with them when you
remove them and other than that they're
only interesting features are the noise
dampening lining on the insides and the
removable panel on the left that you'll
need to remove two screws from then pop
off if you want to expose the vent that
sits next to your GPU area moving to the
inside we find very solid construction
overall but I expect this from
coolermaster so they don't get massive
bonus points for it or anything
sucks to be good at stuff hey guys so
we'll continue the inside tour at the
front the five and a quarter inch cage
can accept a two and a half or three and
a half inch drive in the bottom bay and
is toolless which is good but riveted in
which means no front triple rad mounting
like the define our five with that said
I suspect most people won't do that
anyway so radiator support for the dual
120 millimeter front fans would have
been enough for me and it has that but
the implementation is really really
bizarre kind of like they couldn't
decide if and how they were going to do
it so like I saw that with the front
drive cages removed the red could go on
the inside here with the barbed side
down only by the way which means that
most AIS won't reach the CPU socket or
even a graphics card in the top slot at
least that would've worked if
coolermaster
have the front fan screwed into these
threaded stamped mounts that would
require custom screws and very careful
installation in order to do that then I
noticed that it looked kind of like
there'd be room to put the rat inside
the front bezel only what no wait not
quite enough room so at this point I
finally consulted the manual and
realized they expect you to buy an
optional adapter to put a rat in the
front not a good solution but given that
the top and rear dual and single rad
mounts are fine and how few people need
three radiators I'd have actually given
this a pass still if the air cooling fan
installation method was really good and
that's why water cooling was difficult
but it's not these front screws are
partially threaded presumably to prevent
over tightening of the fence but
unfortunately due to tolerances and
manufacturing we end up with the
opposite problem where my fans actually
had some wiggle in them even when they
were fully screwed in a big no-no for a
silent case although in practice once we
fired it up it didn't end up causing a
lot of vibration really any that I
noticed moving on towards the back we've
got the drive base that most normal
people will leave in that I was
initially going to call over-engineered
for no apparent reason until I figured
out that they're actually surprisingly
clever at the bottom there are three
three and a half inch base that are
screwed in and non adjustable although
you can install two and a half inch
drives in them if you want then the top
four can actually be adjusted by
relocating this piece right here which
allows the plastic sleds to then also be
resized these little wings to be lowered
and SSDs to be screwed in from the sides
in such a way that the SATA power
connector doesn't experience any
unnecessary strain like most other
solutions very nice Coolermaster next to
the drive cage there's a spot for a
filtered 120 millimeter intake fan or
another tune a half inch or three and a
half inch drive to be screwed in from
the bottom of the case then moving
further toward the rear we've got anti
vibration rubber feet for the power
supply an extra auxiliary PCI slot to go
with the standard ATX seven three water
cooling grommets which I used to poke
fun at but now use everyday in one of
their other cases in our whole room
water cooling setup and finally the
third included Silencio
20 millimeter fen at the top we've got
an AI o'doole 120 millimeter liquid
cooler that we were able to install
facing either way thanks to the mounting
slot rather than holes and without
losing access to any of our three five
and a quarter inch bays very nice the
motherboard tray features a cutout for
easy CPU cooler installation yet another
two and a half inch drive sliding
grommet mount ample cable management
loops unexceptional but functional cable
management holes with equally
unexceptional and actually barely good
enough spacing in the back of the tray
to run cables between it and the side
panel if it weren't for the noise
dampening material on that panel they'd
have been fine but as it was I had to do
the push down and slide in order to get
the case closed up so its conclusion
time the case accepts a ton of drives up
to nine three and a half inch and a two
and a half inch or ten two and a half
inch or any combination thereof it looks
great and is really well built but it
loses some marks for its open mesh
that's masquerading as a filtration
system and poorly thought out front fan
mounts so is that a recommendation for
this case not directly but the 652 s is
also not a bad choice it just could have
been a little bit better one change in
particular that I'd like to see on a V 2
of this would be the ability to
completely remove the front door and
stealth the hinge mounting points that
combined with the already excellent
silence to high airflow transformation
that's possible on the top would turn
this into possibly the best implemented
versatile case on the market maybe at
some point Coolermaster will start
letting me look at this stuff before
sending me a finished product and asking
me to review it so I can send them
helpful suggestions like that but for
now we'll have to settle for just
reviews and I hope you guys enjoyed this
