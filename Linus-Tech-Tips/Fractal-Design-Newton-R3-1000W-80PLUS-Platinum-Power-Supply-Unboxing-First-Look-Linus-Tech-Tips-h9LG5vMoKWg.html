a fractal power supply that is an
all-new series for them so they're
completely reconfiguring their power
supply line up and they are bringing
them into the now whatever century were
in I can never remember so 80 plus
platinum nvidia sli and imbue crossfire
certification a five year warranty and
it doesn't get much more beastly than
that does it what do they have to say
for themselves here well first their
seat plastic that needs to go on the
floor and go away okay so much other
languages ah English on the back here we
go so the noon are three series power
supplies provide clean power efficiently
and silently demanding for gaming
computers multiply media pcs the visual
appearance is proof of freckles
commitment to providing innovative
computer components infused with stylish
elegant contemporary Scandinavian design
excellent electrical performance with DC
voltage regulation formidable
suppression that can deliver their full
rated watch continuously even with
intake temperatures as high as 50
degrees wow ok certified with the latest
graphics card 80 plus platinum
certification means we're pretty darn
near 90 plus at this point in time guys
so the new 1000 what they're saying it's
actually above the 80 plus platinum bar
pretty much across the board so it only
dips below ninety percent at the very
very very end of its output capacity
which for most users even promote very
high end users you're not going to get
anywhere near that with a gaming system
all check this out semi pass it down
operation the fan only kicks in at fifty
percent load and then ramps up from
there out standing assuming you're in a
well ventilated case love seeing that
long life ball bearing fans completely
the standard premium Japanese capacitors
single powerful 12 volt rail an
extra-long 80 x 1200 kalma interesting
okay so Wow so far although we haven't
gotten very far it looks like they
download things right here you got a
user's manual which
is moving in okay I'm expecting this to
pretty much say the same things as the
box yep okay thank you for choosing a
fractal design Newton series power
supply for your convenience we even
close some zip ties and velcro straps in
the bag for the modular cables well okay
then softphone Oh compartmentalize
softphone it's almost like got like a 2d
like puzzle game doop doop doop doop i
can't get to power cable nice pick one
modular cabled egg hmm haven't seen this
design before well do her like that oh I
have seen something similar before but
not quite like this so look at that it's
all alike tidy it 800 watt plateau 800
watt floss only I thought it meant 800
watt only I was like well why did they
include one this is a thousand watt
power supply ooh sexy ribbon cables love
it so i'm guessing the white end is the
end that goes on the power supply and
the other end is e and that goes
somewhere else oh there's your extra pen
there's two PCIe there's a few of three
by status look at that they include
different lengths and they even like
that they even like label them for you
so you've got four or three by status 22
by mole X's one with an exhilarating and
then you've got some cable ties and
screws some velcro some plastic and then
silver screws 00 fractal would have
expected to see black screws although
with their cases so if you pair this up
with a fractal case the case is already
going to include black screws for your
power supply anyway alright well let's
check out the psu to solve very
impressed so far though looks like they
are serious business about coming after
very nice so that's either a 130 MOT
five millimeter or one hundred forty
millimeter ball bearing fan in there on
the side you're going to see a fractal
design logo very clean-looking I really
like their logo it's like I said very
clean-looking on the top again you see a
fractal design logo very stylish and on
the other side you see it's capable of
riding up to nine hundred and sixty
watts of its total thousand watt output
on
12 volt rail so it's a little lower than
we've seen on some power supplies that
are capable of almost the whole thing
however I can't imagine a scenario where
you would actually need to draw a
thousand watts from the 12 volt rail
itself it is a single rail power supply
so you don't really have to think about
what you're plugging alright so here we
are guys looking at the permanently
attached cable so it's a semi modular
power supply you got a 20 + 4 pin
sleeves I'm not quite as close to the
end as I would have normally like to see
all right moving right along we've got
what do we have here okay we've got a 4
plus 4 pin and that is a long cable look
at that it's almost one Linus arm length
long pretty much it is one line a
certain length long right to the armpit
thing so that should be able to reach
pretty much no matter what case you're
using it also comes with two
pre-attached 6 plus 2 plus 6 plus 2 so
dual 6 plus 2 connectors I like this
design personally it means you don't
have to run as many cables up to your
graphics card you just run one per
graphics card and then it splits out
from there so those are your included
ones and then optional stuff so you can
attach those additional two PCIe s or
you can attach one additional pcie and
18 pin CPU power connector and then you
can attach six peripheral or SATA /
floppy connectors as well you got more
ventilation holes here you got
ventilation holes in the back and the
usual honeycomb configuration as well as
a power switch so there's not a whole
lot else to say at this point in time
thank you for checking out my unboxing
