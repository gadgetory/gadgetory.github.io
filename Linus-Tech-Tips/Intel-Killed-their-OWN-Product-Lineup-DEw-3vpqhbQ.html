or h EDT lineup has for the most part
been pretty clearly segmented from their
mainstream lineup it's enjoyed
processors with higher core counts and
larger caches and the motherboards have
had more RAM slots taking advantage of
the bandwidth and capacity benefits of
HDD T's beefier memory controllers and
of course on each EDT workstation users
have been able to count on being able to
install a greater number of high
bandwidth PCI Express devices without
running into bottlenecks but I would
actually make the argument that in the
current environment Intel has actually
damaged if not mostly destroyed the
value proposition of their own entire
high-end product stack so what happened
exactly I will tell you after this
message from our sponsor Thursday boots
Thursday boots is a bootstrap startup
haha that handcrafts boots using high
quality materials and sells them at
honest prices check them out at first
day boots comm /lt tee you can wear them
on casual Fridays
Intel had a really good thing going in
the absence of any competition they were
able to stick with quad-core processors
for consumers for 10 years making the
argument that well mainstream workloads
like aiming that they don't need more
course and anyone who does need more
course they've probably got real work to
do and they can justify ponying up for a
chi DT but then AMD happened getting
eight true cores with Rison at the
beginning of 2017 was a shock for the
industry and I don't blame you if you've
forgotten that a core isin started at
329 u.s. dollars with performance that
compared favorably to Intel's a GD t
processors where 8 cores at that time
was going to cost you over a grant now
Intel responded to that threat and they
met AMD's high end thread Ripper line up
head-on by dramatically increasing the
core counts of its a TD T line up from
10 in the previous generation all the
way to 18 with their 7000 series core I
nine CPUs but that wasn't enough while
mainstream core i7 was still the clear
leader in single threaded workloads for
anyone who did anything other than just
gaming on their machine consumer Rison
had a huge price advantage thanks in
part to its affordable motherboards so
Intel finally had to bump their consumer
chips as well first came the six core
Core i7 8700 K at the end of 2017 now
didn't quite bridge the gap in budget
workstation performance with Rison but
it did reduce AMD's leads somewhat and
thanks to its superior single-threaded
performance it kept intel on top for
gaming and some other key workloads then
fast forward another nine months and we
got the core I $9.99 hundred K the first
Intel branded eight core consumer CPU
and the first CPU ever on Intel's
mainstream platform with core on I'm
branding along with the core i7 9700 K
also eight cores but without SMT or
hyper threading technology
and then with those CPUs we've got the
real reason that Intel has been
sandbagging consumer core counts for so
long because the h EDT lineup has been
traditionally based on intel's
workstation and/or server platform where
by the nature of these markets tech
actually tends to move a little slower
it has tended to lag behind their
consumer processors architectural II
sometimes as much as by two generations
so compounding this performance
disadvantage is the fact that h EDT
processors don't hit such high clock
speeds due to power or thermal
constraints and that they don't have an
onboard graphics processor which over
the last five years in particular has
come to act as a coprocessor for certain
workloads on the consumer chips so we're
at a very interesting crossroads right
now think about it when we benchmark
CPUs for our reviews or whatever we tend
to go out looking for workloads that
help us demonstrate the potential
difference in performance from one ship
to another but in the real world
how many workstation tasks like even
workstation tasks do you actually
perform in the course of a workday that
require more than eight cores and of
those how many of them can't be GPU
accelerated in some way that is the ace
up the sleeve of consumer chips and
we'll be demonstrating that using the
platforms you're looking at so with
consumer chips you now have up to 16
threads enough to handle h.264 encoding
without breaking a sweat and the same
goes for light rendering for your 3d
modeling and CAD applications along with
other traditionally CPU intensive tasks
and this is especially true if you have
a GPU that can be used to accelerate
them so just look at how little our
high-end desktop CPUs affect spec view
perf here it's basically just run two
run variants in most scenarios in fact
what's really interesting here is that
our main stream processors enjoy a
signal
it can advantage in applications like
SolidWorks which is a traditionally
workstation workload thanks to their
much higher clock speeds this is again
apparent in the case of Adobe Premiere
whereas we've tested before more cores
does matter but only to a point so here
we've reached that happy medium where
the thread count the superior per core
performance and the integrated graphics
of the core I 999 hundred K put it in a
league of its own way out ahead of
Intel's own a TD T chips even though
some of them have more cores I mean this
is amazing when you recall again that
just two years ago we were stuck with
four cores on Intel's consumer platform
and had to pay a huge premium to get six
or eight let alone the ten core 6950 X
that actually cost more by itself than
the entire mainstream test bench that we
are running here because remember the
difference in CPU price is just part of
the story the price difference between
the platforms themselves can also be
significant so all it'll take now is for
AMD to continue to press the advantage
of their modular cpu design and push
core counts even higher with Zen - and
then assuming that Intel follows suit
and we know by now that they will have
to the likely result we think is going
to be the contraction and eventual
disappearance of the traditional h EDT
lineup from intel like think about it
for light workstation use honestly Apple
hit the nail on the head with the iMac
photographers haven't really needed
powerful workstations for a very long
time now in video production h EDT has
offered clear performance improvements
even as recently as two to three years
ago and has also leveraged the increased
pci express bandwidth with expansion
cards like red rocket accelerators but
GPU compute has eroded the market for
devices like that very significantly I
mean how many expansion cards do you
have in your system
so we're not saying that chips like
thread Ripper and then tell zone hike or
count CPUs won't continue to have a
place in desktop workstations
there are workloads for them we're just
saying that the use cases for those
chips are not very mainstream anymore
and that h EDT
is the wrong product for those kinds of
customers and the reason is ECC memory
support
Rison supports ECC from the ground floor
all the way up to thread Ripper - which
makes it perfect for an entry-level
workstation that has a need for ECC by
contrast intel has desperately clung to
the paradigm of removing ECC from its
consumer and h EDT processors to force
anyone doing more mission-critical work
to spend still more on a Xeon that
obviously isn't going to last so the
bottom line is this we were wrong when
we did our review of the Xeon w we said
Xeon w had no reason to exist with only
ECC to differentiate it from h EDT
because the performance was the same but
actually h EDT has no reason to exist if
it doesn't support ECC because it's
getting eaten away at from both the
bottom and the top by Intel's own 9000
series consumer chips and AMD's thread
Ripper so here's our new proposed line
up you continue to expand the consumer
chips with more course when possible but
don't compromise single-threaded
performance that's still your key
advantage in certain workloads like
gaming and SolidWorks then once that's
done you replace the high core count
line up wholesale with Xeon w so that's
the lower end single socket only
workstations the online and while you're
at that you get your head out of your
butt when it comes to the pricing of
those chips they should end up in line
with the core AI nines that they will
replace that way you cut out one entire
platform to support which makes life
easier on marketing teams and board
partners and consumers now I suspect
Intel won't take my advice as to like
making money after all
but there may come a time
when it's absolutely necessary just like
very eventually gonna have to bring
coffee like refresh to their LGA 1151
Zeon's threatening even Zeon W but
that's a conversation for another day
for now the bottom line is this let's
give credit where credit is due
AMD brought more course to the table and
Intel responded in kind
so there has never been a better time to
build a value oriented desktop machine
that can do serious workstation work and
if this is what the death of a GD T as
we know looks like then I am super ok
with that
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction when you call ting you
don't speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and it
doesn't cost extra you pay only for what
you use with the average ting bill
coming in at just $23 a month per device
and they've got lower mobile data rates
than ever it just $10 a gig beyond the
second gig and if you're stuck in a
contract and you switch to ting they'll
actually cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to $75 so head over to Linus 2018
dot teen.com
we're gonna have that linked below and
try out their savings calculator you'll
enter your last couple bills and how
much you paid and find out how much
you'd save on ting then when you sign up
with our link you get 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
sweet right - 2018 dot ting calm down
there so thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
