putting up all the journalists for the
event that i'm attending right now this
is kind of cool they've actually got
live trees growing inside the hotel
lobby which seems like a good idea until
you're walking around on the inside of a
hotel lobby and it's autumn and there
are leaves all over the place still
super neat though d skills new Ripjaws
for series is their ultimate ddr4 memory
with speeds of up to three thousand
three hundred and thirty three megahertz
available click now to learn more so
i've been talked into going on a
sailboat something I hadn't really
intended to do but we've we've got a
couple hours to kill so wish me luck
definitely a different experience I
think I'm late for the bus
I think we're all supposed to be like
going to the aquarium or something feels
kind of like a elementary school field
trip as far as I can tell this is kind
of like the NASCAR of fish except we
turned to the right and thus begins the
aquarium to her so this is interesting
we thought we found one that was going
against the flow but apparently they're
just all gonna turn around now and I'm
sure I'm an idiot for asking this
question but where the hell are they
coming from there must be a trick I
walked up behind this guy kind of going
why are you looking at these tiny little
things they're stupid and then noticed
they're things like glow and flash and
stuff check that out
freaking cool apparently these are sea
gooseberries because the gooseberries
glow alright now we're talking no more
jellyfish now we got like sharks and
stuff and they expect us to pay
attention to graphics cards now selfie
with the shark
the Sharks going that way oh my head's
covering it there we go
check this out look at all these fish on
the bottom sure don't like that shark ma
che oh here come two more here we go and
if my camera can focus that'd be great
Wow
it's a good thing this isn't a beauty
contest to be featured in here
turtle time now I heard there was a
movie about these although he moved a
little faster in the movie hate to break
it to you dude but that's a blue wall
alright so I got back to the room and it
looks like the hotel finally managed to
drop off my care package so we'll do a
short like package unboxing so to speak
first thing inside is some kind of
nvidia clothing they're hiring me no no
I don't think that's what's happening no
they're just trying to completely take
over my wardrobe so just a little subtle
Nvidia things that's pretty nice
actually alright what's next
hmm dunt dunt uh shield wireless
controller a shield tablet cover and
there is the shield tablet so you get
the whole shebang tablet cover and
wireless controller this is like the
secret piece of paper with all the
embargoed information on it Hayes from
monoprice look at that so presumably I
cable of some sort okay so that's mini
HDMI to HDMI so that you can use console
mode and then we've got you a nametag
I'm from Linus tech tips yeah and
finally a lanyard which is presumably
for the nametag not bad not a bad haul
yeah I make haul videos now or something
that's where you like make a video in
the hall blam all right so it's the
morning of day 2 and I would feel and
look a lot better if I hadn't stayed up
so late reading all the comments on the
1 million subscriber awesome celebration
video but of course you know still leave
comments I will read all the comments on
that video they've been very uplifting
if you haven't already make sure that
you're entered in the giveaway over
there giving away a gaming PC a surface
it's gonna be pretty sweet so now I
finally get to go downstairs and
hopefully there's still some breakfast
left there supposedly serving it for
another 20 minutes so we've got some
breakfast and then I'll find out why
we're actually here it's presentation
time all right so the presentations are
over and it's time to go and play with
the demos so naturally that would be
done in the ballroom it's kind of like
the baldhead you know cuz you play maybe
there's guy thinks he's allowed to be in
my video I don't even have a signed
release from you I'm not putting you in
my video not from you but not also
didn't ask permission from him it's
alright so here is where all the crazy
magic new tech is going on they've got a
couple demos from oculus as well as
presumably some of the stuff they just
showed us so let's go let's go have a
look at the demo stations so today was
bananas some of the stuff we learned
about wasn't really new but definitely
stuff that I didn't have nearly the kind
of understanding of that I now do so now
it's time to go have like dinner on the
beach or something like that so that's
pretty cool and then tomorrow is another
full day of presumably more stuff so I
made it to dinner and we've got like the
most colourful chairs in the world at
what seems to be like a pretty cool
party speaking of cool guys Scott from
the tech report and I caught him off
guard here a little bit I think
hey cool party we've got some prizes to
give away but Rises you say here in the
sand is that right Kelsey yeah you want
him to have anything you gotta be down
here I was told this guy is like the
one-man party I was told in the video
neither the real athletes here am I
right Lord oh yeah baby
and I got a lab mic on alright alright
idiot so guys your job is to make these
guys vote for you
so ya gotta do something funny that's
gonna separate yourself from the rest of
the crowd no no I can try well that's
okay with me wait somebody else what
everything you've got into it okay
from Canada
everybody okay let's get the guy from
Canada right here Kelly you come on out
here - we're gonna have a UH what do you
think if I twerk will more of you vote
for me I bet you're awesome but it's
Kelly awesome job I'm glad they didn't
say yes
chin up now chin looking good guys are
you I think you're at a bit of a
disadvantage I actually just walk right
in
good search and then we're gonna let you
go again pretty let you go okay
we got another guy down alright you get
a no chance he didn't spill a drop
buried up come on up here bro get a guy
in the blue shirt
he'll help bro she's going down you
can't hold the stick okay if he makes it
he is our champion is our champion
come on now guys we all gotta help him
out a little bit boy he is down she gets
one last ride I think we got a champion
and Ike I try one more time all right
all right well that was totally totally
worth it you really listen this is my
prize right stick holders fantastic
stake holders those were all yours to
eat brother so the so beer pong we got
kicked out of the hall here and
evidently it's just been set up outside
because that's a sensible thing thank
you for that so for this this is this is
the plan now the table in the middle of
the sand all right so it's the last day
of the trip and we're gonna be doing a
kayaking soon I had the second day of
briefing that of course I can't say
anything about at all and I'm just
trying to get some sunscreen so I'm at
the Walgreens here and huh okay well
apparently this is not a store entrance
so it's time to go on an epic journey so
an interesting thing I realized while I
was here is that I've been calling
unassuming I've been calling the cheese
wrong all this time I call it Monterey
Jack and I think it must be Monterey
because everyone here pronounces it that
way
the soldiers were making fun of me for
vlogging I was gonna tell them off but
they're soldiers
I didn't you know back when it was film
I can see why one-hour photo was
impressive but now that they're just
printing them is that brilliant
achievement so I'm looking for SPF 50
and there's not a whole lot of options
there's a lot of spray-on ones there's a
lot of like for babies and for kids and
then there's like this one for $13 or I
can buy Hello Kitty for nine I got one
of those left and I think that's what
we're doing and now I'm running late of
course I'm vlogging about it
forgot my credit card so I had to go
back again for my Hello Kitty sunscreen
directions oh no this is great
ingredients just like two things in it
purpose sunscreen love it
just in case I didn't know that purpose
sunscreen so I'm on the bus and we've
got some interesting characters here
with me did you forget we were going
somewhere no the only thing geekier than
a bunch of computer geeks is a bunch of
computer geeks in like wood sale yeah
nice and that's a nice sunscreen
application technique you've got going
on a Demetri yeah well it's better than
you what you got going on I don't know
what let's learn how to operate the
paddle intently you want it to go with
the flat side into the water not the
other side so I think I can handle that
but the part about not leaning out of
the boat I think I might have a little
bit of trouble with that so see how this
goes we've been instructed to hold on to
the kelp to stay still
we found a sea otter you're not allowed
to go within 50 feet of them so this is
I think about it but he's over there
I've been assured that he's over there
I'm about to turn it in the wind all
right
well evidently these are not naturally
white rocks those are those are Boop
rocks fantastic
there are some harbor seals way out
there can't get too close though
apparently it's they come near you it's
okay and there's a couple guys right eat
here I don't think you're gonna be able
to pick them up on camera hey kind of
see his head they're cool
so my excursion ran a little longer than
I had kind of sort of thought about or
expected so I'm out on a kayak I booked
it back to the dock I my my tendon kayak
partner
oh my tandem kayak partner has to come
in and help him get out of the boat and
he goes out on his own and I run back to
the hotel right after I arrived they
sorted it out and found me a new flight
so I'm not in a hurry at all so I guess
the good news is now I get to have a
shower before the flight all right so my
skin's still wet but I that's on account
of having just showered not actually
being sweaty but I have a philosophical
dilemma for you guys what is cleaner the
pants that I have already worn for two
days or the pants that I've only been
wearing since this morning but that I
was just running in okay and making the
decision even more difficult I removed
my belt and all the things from my
pockets and didn't mark which one is
which so now it's just a crapshoot a new
piece of information in pants dilemma
and the great pants dilemma of 2014
these are the ones from the other couple
days oh maybe it's these ones whichever
ones have a bunch of sand in the pockets
from the hula contest are the ones from
the other day so now I have to decide
somewhat damp but obviously not damp
enough I could tell the difference
between them but no sand in the pockets
to get into you know places I think I'm
gonna go with the the Wet Ones with no
sand yeah we have a decision
all right so this is at the end of the
trip I
actually had intended to shoot my last
bit not on my phone but on the camera
instead but I realized as I was going
through airport security that I had my
lavell ear mic in my shirt I'm like
wired up with this then I was like oh
crap this looks weird so I quickly threw
off I can put that back on in the
airport so that's it I hope you guys
enjoyed this travel blog and help you're
looking forward to whatever it is I was
doing here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
