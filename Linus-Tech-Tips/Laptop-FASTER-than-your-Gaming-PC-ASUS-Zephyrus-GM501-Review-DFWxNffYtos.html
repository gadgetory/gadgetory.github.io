low-power gaming GPUs notebook
manufacturers fighting to make Barre
devices as thin and powerful as possible
made headlines with some let's call them
unconventional designs I'm sorry you put
the trackpad where oh I don't know if
that's any better now they were cool to
play with but the usability sacrifices
made them very hard to recommend
so a soos backtracked on some of their
more edgy design choices in this the
second generation Zephyrus speaking of
choices today's video is brought to you
by a great choice private Internet
access
near the VPN service that encrypts all
of your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP p ia has a ton of other
useful features as well so you can check
them out at the link below
the Zephyrs GM 501 is a sexy machine and
opening it up at the local coffee shop
is bound to draw attention the guy
watching summit 1g on twitch will notice
the keyboard area lifting up creating a
gap for the internals to breathe and
then everyone else will probably turn
their heads when you boot it up really
guys that's the idea you rip off from a
shirt and you guys will hear just a
moment the start engine noise that comes
to this notebook it's pretty cool
anyway the vent flap itself is a little
flimsy feeling when it's lifted but the
feel of the entire machine including the
keyboard is nothing short of premium
noticeably better than last gen and the
flap closes when you pack up making it a
total non concern if you want to throw
those efforts into your bag and then get
to class if the first thing you do when
you get home is fire up Netflix or a
game stream the speakers are potent
enough that you won't need to grab a
pair of headphones but if you want to be
the one doing the streaming you are
definitely going to need some
accessories in spite of the fairly
complete IO including Thunderbolt 3
first and foremost you're gonna want a
Type C to display port adapter for your
external display then you're gonna want
a Gigabit Ethernet adapter and finally
you are definitely going to want a
different webcam because the one that's
included is well I think the best way to
put it is not very exceptional even if
you are considerably better-looking than
me
it's definitely got enough power though
not only will its full-fat gtx 1070 push
a high enough framerate in modern
triple-a titles but it's six core cpu
means that finally we've got a portable
device that covers you for both your
game and your streaming coating the
experience is shockingly similar
- what you'd get from a very decent
desktop machine but the same is not true
of acoustics and thermals with a
full-blown synthetic load there is some
overheating at first
despite the spoiler but the good news is
that the frequency on the CPU doesn't
drop too much to get the temps
reasonable again so in productivity
tasks the new Zephyrus is faster than
every seventh gen laptop we tested and
the only laptop it loses to in Cinebench
is the G 702 zc that one with a tries in
cores with an actual desktop chip in it
so needless to say this one is about 44%
thinner than that one so this is great
news for video editors or other
on-the-go content creators as for gaming
well you've actually got a couple of
tuning options in shadow of war in
silent mode
we've got 77 frames per second which is
respectable but it clearly wasn't
designed to be used like that
so we toggled overboost cranking up the
fans now this is not a quiet experience
but if you play games with sound
especially if you wear headphones it's
definitely worth it a hundred and four
FPS dang like that is an insane
improvement so with the fans on bust the
Zephyrus beats out even it's much
thicker seventh gen siblings and that is
in spite of a touch of thermal
throttling on the CPU probably the
coolest thing happening in laptops right
now alongside incredible performance is
high refresh rate displays and this
1080p IPS one is fantastic now the
colors aren't quite what I would
describe as pro grade but they are heaps
better than any high refresh rate laptop
display from a year or two ago and at
144 Hertz with g-sync
you will finally be getting the most out
of your Opie mobile graphics card so
there are no huge surprises so far a
gaming laptop that games whoo but it's
actually more than just a one-trick pony
the RGB lighting on the keyboard might
not be for everyone but this typing
experience probably will be most gaming
laptops have low actuation force keys
that are awesome for quick split-second
actions but fall flat
once you try and type but with a long
1.7 millimeter travel the zephyrus
offers a surprisingly tactile feel like
I could easily sit and write scripts or
long letters to people who are mad about
my recent you know insert controversial
topic here video honey below the
keyboard is a trackpad it's a little on
the small side
but thanks to its somewhat sensible
positioning thank you Asus it's
perfectly suitable for casual on-the-go
use that is if you want to carry around
the 1.8 pound power adapter with you on
the go on the subject of which we were
actually expecting much better battery
life than other gaming laptops a soos
has given you the option to turn off
vsync and then with a restart enable
Nvidia Optimus which lets the laptop use
the Intel integrated graphics for tasks
like web browsing and Microsoft Word but
in practice we were still only getting
around two and a half hours in our work
battery test and opening it up reveals
why the 55 watt hour battery doesn't
stand a chance against a six core CPU
now I think the solution is ditching the
two and a half inch drive bay for more
battery capacity here but the upgraders
out there might like it better this way
maybe let us know in the comments so is
the Zephyrus for you then
well at 2200 US dollars for the gtx 1070
model
with some better battery it would be a
lot easier to recommend but that doesn't
mean we're recommending against it
either because the Zephyrus has one of
the best mobile gaming experiences
available on the market it's got an
awesome keyboard great screen and heaps
of sex appeal so if you can afford the
not entirely ludicrous premium the
zephyrus TM 501 asks for the fewest
compromises we've seen out of a gaming
fin and light so far just like our
