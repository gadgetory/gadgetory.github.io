Samsung's 28d 590 D 28 inch ultra HD 4k
monitor too good to be true I mean it's
literally one-fifth the price of what
you would have been expected to pay six
short months ago if you wanted a 4k
display for your PC so let's get to it
shall we
kicking things off on the product page
we find this little tidbit
unlike other value 4k monitors notably
the Dell P 28 1 5 Q Samsung's value 4k
monitor runs at 60 Hertz and boasts one
millisecond great degree response times
and unlike other 4k monitors in general
it does it as a single stream no multi
stream side-by-side display tomfoolery
huge thanks to Ryan shroud at PC / felt
when we test this by the way since
Samsung doesn't document the feature and
none of this capo 30 Hertz nonsense
that may be suitable for watching movies
but is a huge step backwards for gaming
or even general computer use where we've
become accustomed to 60 Hertz or higher
refresh rates over the last couple of
decades please note however that you
will need a DisplayPort 1.2 output to
run at 4k 60 Hertz with a single cable
otherwise you can run 4k 30 Hertz with a
single HDMI input or another cool option
is that you could use an HDMI cable and
a DVI to HDMI cable to both of the HDMI
inputs with Samsung's picture by picture
mode and a display spanning technology
like AMD eyefinity or an NVIDIA surround
except that AMD in their infinite wisdom
doesn't allow custom resolutions in
their driver and I can't get the DVI
adapter output to run at 1920 by 2160
and NVIDIA in their equally infinite
wisdom doesn't allow to monitor surround
configurations thanks guys this solution
works pretty well though and does help
AMD users stuck with DisplayPort 1.1
outputs but if you've got DisplayPort
1.2 then just run that by itself the
next spec of note is that while Samsung
specifically calls out that the panel
ecology is Tian they're also claiming
support for 1 billion colours so what
does that mean 1 billion color support
versus 16.7 million on a typical 8-bit
display implies that we're dealing with
a 10 bit display PC monitors dot info
believes that Samsung is achieving their
results with a true 8 bit panel and 2
bit framerate control dithering pretty
unexpected for a TN monitor but the even
more unexpected thing about this is that
it actually appears to work pretty well
obviously this footage of the screens is
being captured by a camera encoded and
compressed and editing and then
compressed again by YouTube so if you
can't see a clear difference in these
grayscale gradients you'll have to
believe me when I say that our 590 D
looks a lot more similar to our a sous
pro art 246 q a true 10-bit IPS display
with a 12 bit lookup table than it does
to our 215 TW an 8 bit native display
very impressive so far but a monitor
product page wouldn't be complete
without some pure horse plop and
Samsung's mega infinity seriously
dynamic contrast ratio is the stupidest
thing I've seen in quite some time
fortunately they list a static contrast
ratio as well and it's one thousand to
one which is both fairly respectable and
much more believable from having use the
product let's move on physically the
monitor is a mixed bag for me the slim
bezel and thin overall design is great
the semi matte screen is just the right
mix of anti glare and vibrant colors and
the rear mounted joystick for the
on-screen controls works really really
well but I sure wish they hadn't gone
with a glossy bezel and the stands
features are very unexceptional with
tilt only and no support for swivel
pivot or even height adjust which I
could have forgiven if they'd included a
four screw vase amount on the back so it
could be replaced but they didn't
however I guess I can see why that would
have been difficult with how thin the
monitor is overall yeah at the back of
the monitor we find two HDMI inputs and
a DisplayPort input and along with the
power brick Samsung does include cables
for each of those in the box a nice
touch these can be used one at a time or
in a couple of unique ways with Samsung
touting their unscaled 1080p picture in
picture mode and their 1920 by 2160
picture
by picture modes as content enjoyment
and productivity boosters of course you
can also scale the 1080p picture in
picture and move it around if you want
as well alright so specs are fun but who
is this product for exactly there aren't
really any native 4k movies or TV shows
now and there's plenty of time for
better display options to become
available before that really happens so
while the 590 D is a crazy value for a
4k monitor it's still pretty pricey and
other than high refresh rate gaming
grade LCDs you'd be hard-pressed to find
a more expensive TN monitor something
that may be a turn-off for media buffs
and general consumers but the price
really wouldn't be that scary to a
prosumer user or an entry level creative
professional and 4k is a very tempting
feature so could it take the place of a
value 1440p 27-inch like the Sue's PB -
7 8 q which features a pls panel or even
an entry-level professional display like
the 24-inch PA - 4 9q which comes with a
factory calibrated 10 bit aged IPS panel
wide gamut support and some other handy
features i'll be it at a 24 inch size
well short answer no long answer the
pitfalls of TN are still here in spite
of the 1 billion color rating side to
side viewing angles were strong with
minimal color shift so from a normal
sitting position the screen looks quite
uniform but vertical viewing angles are
not good enough for any kind of serious
professional work where color
consistency is needed with color
saturation being noticeably higher at
the top of the monitor versus the bottom
from a fixed viewing position but
creative pros the news isn't all bad
from a workflow perspective the extra
pixels are well I'll put it in the words
of my editor Etzel I want one and he's
got a point
if you view your new 4k display as an
additional piece of equipment rather
than as a replacement for your existing
monitor I think you'll be much happier
with your purchase
check out this premier layout that is
enough screen real estate for an
unscaled 1080p program plenty of room
for source clips and time line as well
as all the little tools you need then
when you're done with that you just drag
it over twice
smaller color calibrated display for any
serious color work and for a little over
a thousand dollars you've got a super
value optimized dual monitor setup for
your work and if your work doesn't
depend on color then there are lots of
ways that other professionals might use
the extra pixels online poker players
can leverage the extra space by
spreading everything out manually or day
traders might use a program like display
fusion to divide it up into four virtual
1080p workspaces the sky is the limit
the caveat here though is that unless
your eyes are very very good using it in
this manner will be difficult and while
you can scale up UI elements in Windows
so that they're larger but just sharper
due to the higher pixel density not all
programs scale text correctly and some
will look downright awful but what about
games if your graphics card can take the
heat PC gamers have had 4k content for
years now samsung claims that due to its
one millisecond greater response times
you will not notice any leg so this
might be a fantastic gaming monitor but
is it true unfortunately we don't have
the gear to test it empirically but to
give us some idea of what we're working
with we pulled out the fairly well
regarded PB 2 7 8 Q and took some
high-speed footage of our two monitors
running Far Cry 3 side-by-side we opted
to use Samsung's gaming mode for our
tests this is a welcome feature that's
found on many TVs that does slightly
reduce image quality but promises less
lag from the image source and our
results are pretty impressive the two
displays were nearly impossible to
distinguish from each other playing back
even frame by frame at 240 FPS so that's
about 4 milliseconds per frame in
gameplay but when entering and exiting
menus we've got some interesting insight
while the input latency on the PB might
be slightly less because the 590 DS
pixel switch so much faster the image
actually reaches the eyes of the gamer
at the same time or even slightly faster
this information combined with this
monitors wicked pixel density that all
but eliminates the need for
anti-aliasing translates into a very
satisfying gaming experience with very
little noticeable delay and motion blur
the 2d 590 D is a solid recommendation
for gamers just make sure you've got the
graphics card muscle and frame buffer to
back it up which leads us to our
conclusion now the same goes
the best for last but in this case I
actually saved the worst for last I know
your finger has been itching on that Buy
button for the last eight minutes or so
and if you do buy one please use our
affiliate links in the video description
but only do so if you fully understand
the drawbacks of this monitor it may be
the best value for K display on the
market but it's still pretty expensive
and some corners did get cut first up
the high quality metal construction of
the stand is a selling point that seems
to be missing on samsung comm and
rightfully so but can be found on
retailer websites including Amazon and
NCIX the stand is indeed made of metal
but I wouldn't drive my car over a
bridge made of it
the second big drawback is the uneven
appearance of the panel when certain
uniform colors are displayed thankfully
full white and full black are not
affected but some colors such as dull
blue and any shade of gray are affected
to capture this on camera we did have to
shoot from an angle but the effect the
modeled effect is very noticeable in
person even looking at it straight on it
was actually the first thing I noticed
about the monitor when I powered it up
for the first time the last thing that
would delay the purchase for me
personally is that the monitor uses
DisplayPort 1.2 not the upcoming one
point 2a which is rumored to contain
support for AMD's g-sync competitor
freesync a feature that I would really
like to see on any monitor that I spend
over $500 on for gaming although I mean
it's no fault of the monitors it's not
available yet so with all that out of
the way know it's not perfect but if
you're ok with all that stuff if you
want a 4k display on a budget will you
be happy with your purchase is this
worth the asking price compared to other
products available in the market right
now the answer is yes all the yes go buy
it now yes it is a phenomenally good
value anyway guys thank you for watching
