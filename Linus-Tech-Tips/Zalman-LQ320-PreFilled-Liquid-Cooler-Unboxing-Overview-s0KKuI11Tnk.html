the Zelman lq 320 altima tuck wha'd
cooler this is a 120 millimeter liquid
cooler uses a low profile block design
quarter inch tubing it's an ASA tech
based design so what that means is
you've got a very mature retention
mechanism based on their ring mounting
so we've seen this before we're pretty
familiar with it the difference between
this one and the 315 is the fact that
the radiator is thicker comes with
instructions for how to install the
entire thing but other than that it is
very similar to what we found with the
315 so what Salman's done to
differentiate this particular a Sutekh
cooler from the other ones that are out
there is a couple of things so number
one they're still using quarter inch
tubing which has advantages such as the
very tight Bend radiuses that are
possible radii radiuses radius I you
know what it doesn't matter they've
added a blue LED to the block itself so
it's got a plastic cover on it now which
were actually just gonna remove there
there we go
alright so it's still an illuminated Z
logo like that and this I think is a
pretty nice touch so they've added a
faux brushed aluminum finish to the side
of the radiator on both sides so that's
using plastic which is just I mean
honestly it looks just as good as the
actual aluminum finishes that you see
but it's not fingerprint prone and it's
much easier to clean and all of that
kind of good stuff
it also means that they've added these
brass threads instead of just threading
the actual shroud on the radiator itself
so these should be a little bit easier
to find the right threads and avoid
stripping compared to just the the
regular designs that we've seen in the
past where it's just the the tank the
tank shroud itself that is just tapped
with a with a tap so other than that I
mean more thickness is more better in
general so the thicker the radiator is
the more cooling performance you're
going to get out of it but you need to
have a pressure optimized fan so zalman
includes their ultra quiet fan here
which only mounts one way on the
radiator should be
because on the other side you don't
actually have mounting holes so you can
see and I'll hold it up this way just
for a change of pace you can see that
it's here on this side and it's missing
on this other side so while you actually
can go both ways on it if you don't have
a seal around the frame of the radiator
so if you had it mounted this way you're
gonna lose some of that performance so
you're gonna be drawing air through the
fan this way and some of its going to
come in from here and not actually be
forced to pass through the fins
themselves so that can affect your
cooling performance mounting hardware as
I said before is included ez 775 1155
1156 1366 2011 a.m. 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 3 + se
M 2 + FM 1 FM 2 pretty much whatever you
want to mount it to you can the bottom
of the block has a high quality thermal
compound pre applied to it I would
definitely recommend using this for your
first application because it's good it's
not until you take the block off and
then you need to reapply it that you
have to replace it with some other
thermal paste so thank you for checking
