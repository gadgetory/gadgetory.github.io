video Intel Extreme Masters is a
legendary production that hosts some of
the biggest teams playing the most
popular eSports titles and these events
happen multiple times a year all over
the world now ESL has invited us to take
a look behind the scenes and what it
takes to run one of these types of shows
we've never done something like this
before and I'm super excited so let's
get to it
this event is featuring two main titles
simultaneously League of Legends and
Counter Strike global Offensive and I
mean that literally eSports League has
split Oracle Arena in to dedicating you
one side to each title and they're being
streamed live at the exact same time the
majority of the magic that you see on
the stage itself like all the physical
effects and LEDs all that fun stuff is
managed by a team of people that is
sandwiched between the two stages hidden
by some black curtains doing all of that
stuff live now for the League of Legends
matches those are all hosted on Riot
Games own servers on tournament realms
off-site but counter-strike on the other
hand is hosted here by ESL that helps
USL because with Riot Games they can't
set up scripts on the server for
counter-strike they actually can and
that gives them the ability to queue
things that happen on the server to make
effects happen on stage or for your own
Street that doesn't remove the job of
the league operators but it just gives
them more control and more ability which
is pretty cool for the majority of what
people will see the live streams we have
to move on to the main production
control room this area is just a sea of
high-end battle stations and monitors
and control panels absolutely everywhere
so to keep this manageable we're gonna
go from group to group first off we have
the fiber rack and there is a lot of
runs going to it this is the main input
for the entire control room and this
will include things like all of the
different cameras the in-between stage
production area the hosts the casters
everything secondly we have the audio
mixing station this is specifically for
the broadcast not for the stage if
you're watching the stream this guy
controls what you're listening to third
we have the graphics station any cool
effects or awesome looking graphics that
appear on-screen
are queued up by this guy he has some
really high end custom broadcasting
software running here not xsplit or OBS
but we'll get more into that later and
fourth we have the observer group this
is the group of guys that will get all
the various in-game camera angles that
can be switched to on the fly and this
is also where the instant replay machine
is this guy has to do instant replays
manually so if you see a replay on
stream it's because this guy was on the
ball
and then fifth there's the technical
director this guy controls what camera
feed is actually being shown on screen
at a specific time the technical
director will take cues directly from
the row behind him station number six
the producer row this is where the live
producer and creative producer will act
kind of like puppet masters making sure
that all the other stations around them
are doing the right thing at the right
time so everything looks good for you
guys at home and last but not least is
the recording and streaming section this
is where all of that stuff that we
talked about earlier comes together and
is transcoded into one video feed using
Intel Quick Sync on a core i7 processor
the same ones the competitors are using
and then it is put up online through OBS
so that you guys can watch it on twitch
TV yes I did say OBS they do use OBS for
the final push I assume DSL setup would
be extensive but I never expected how
elaborate it would actually be I really
appreciate them showing us around they
had to do it while the event was
actually running so hopefully you guys
did like what we were able to show you
in the end they get it Intel for sending
us to IEM Oakland 2016 you guys want to
