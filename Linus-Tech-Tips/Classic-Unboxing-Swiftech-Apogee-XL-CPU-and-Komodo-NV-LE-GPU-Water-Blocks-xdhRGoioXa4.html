ultimate system click now to learn more
this is a momentous occasion we actually
haven't done an unboxing in this
calendar year but this is it this will
be a dual unboxing special edition
unboxing to promote an extremely
exciting series of videos that we have
coming over the next little while
our whole room liquid cooling project
which you can actually see we are in the
middle of implementing so we've gone
hardware here we've got Luke modding
cases out on the porch oh we've got
hardware for 5 rigs all over the floor
over in the tech quickie set so um yeah
let's unbox the main event as far as the
actual water cooling systems go so yes
we're gonna have radiators hanging off
the roof of the house and that's how
we're going to take care of actually
dissipating the heat like you have to
connect something to the six core
extreme editions or in the case of EDS
those rigs twelve core Xeon you have to
connect something to the CPUs and
something to the GTX Titans to remove
the heat from the cards and put it in to
the water so that will be handled by on
the CPUs and Apogee XL CPU blocks let's
go ahead and have the unboxing
experience shall we first thing inside
is an installation guide which is pretty
typical of Swift tech they provide it in
a bunch of different languages they're
not honestly they're mounting system is
pretty self-explanatory so you probably
won't need it but it does include some
important steps like removing the
plastic film and how to install thermal
compound no you do not spread it out
even cooling experts agree there you go
install it a little something like that
alright then I guess color plates so you
actually get a variety of different
color plates and because we're building
five systems at once we are going with
blue because that's what's on by default
but you can swap it out and you can put
in red white or green Christmasy alright
next layer we get some Swift tag branded
thermal compound
Tim mate all right Tim good I might know
that noise and then you also get some
mounting hardware so this is for AMD and
you'll actually swap out the stock
that's funny
they individually package each of the
hip D pieces which I guess shouldn't
surprise me because they also
individually package their compression
fittings
there's our pile of them for the photo
setup here wall alright so we've got our
a MIDI mounting hardware then we've got
the pre-installed Intel mounting
hardware for LGA 1155 1156 or 1150 there
so there's a backplate and then spring
loaded screws on here with these with
these nuts keeping them from you know
just spinning infinitely you can swap
that out with LGA 2011 mounting hardware
which is what we're going to need to do
because that's what our rigs are going
to be using so those are the blocks and
I actually have one so this is e
Diesel's machine with the 12 cores Deon
already installed we are going to
install compression fittings on here and
then it's got 64 gigs of Kingston HyperX
minner memory on an a CSX 79 deluxe and
this lights up blue and it's going to
look all sweet and it's gonna be awesome
alright so next is this is the Big
Kahuna this is the Komodo NV le which
normally stands for a light edition or
looser edition or lame edition but in
this case it stands for luxury edition
so same thing you get some pretty
rudimentary instructions put the screws
in the thing use the back plate for the
other things okay it's compatible with
787 ATT eyes and Titans as well as Titan
blacks depending on the PCB being used
and then is that a beautiful water block
look at this thing so you've got an
acetal as well as brushed metal and
acrylic construction you've got this one
also has replaceable light here we go
here's the replacement ones it also has
replaceable lighting so it comes with
blue and red and I believe they have
green pre-installed although don't quote
me on that you get an allen key for
going ahead and installing things and
stuff taking
and all that noise on the back oh yeah
that nickel-plated everything is good
you're going to want to take these off
before installing the block and then it
also comes with a nice thick one of the
thickest I've ever seen actually it
comes with some more thermal compound
comes with stop fittings as well as all
the screws you need surprise those
aren't individually packaged like one
bag per screw alright and then it comes
with one of the thickest back plates
that I've ever seen that has a nice
brushed aluminum finish to it very nice
and then they've also they've done it so
that the Swift tech logo will be right
side up once the card is actually
installed in your system I can show you
a finished one so this one I have
already assembled and installed the
compression fittings on so that's what
it's going to look like on the Titan
black editions that we are using for
this whole setup so that's what it will
look like actually installed in the
system
gorgeous alright so thanks for checking
