brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with course our memory and
Western Digital it's part one of our
razor suite coverage this is the general
overview of the new stuff that they're
showing off so there's of course there
ad Aros line of headphones and ian's
ears
so we have the creatively named Dada
rose in ears these ones actually go up
your butt no no I'm just kidding they go
in your ears if you put them up your
butt not only will they not sound very
good but they will be seriously not
green anymore which is a real problem so
these are aimed more for not necessarily
just gamers but also music enthusiasts
and that's where you'll get into the
naming of some of these other products
as well so they're going to have a DJ
model that's not here so obviously
that's not just aimed at gamers unless
you all happen to moonlight as a DJ as
well so the idea behind those is they're
extremely comfortable they isolate noise
so obviously there's some overlap
between the needs of gamers and the
needs of DJ's so it's a bit of a natural
move for them but unfortunately we can't
show you that right now but what we do
have are the Adaro stereos so these are
a lightweight 2 speaker system based on
the name once again very very creative
razer thank you very much for that as
always they're lightweight beautiful
robust feeling and these guys are just
masters of industrial design in spite of
the fact that the headband is a little
bit on the thin side for me the fact
that it has nice supple cushioning and
the fact that they're so lightweight
means that they're not uncomfortable
next up we've got the Bluetooth Adaro
switch creatively named SPO because it
has bluetooth so that that that is once
again them just really going out on a
limb trying to confuse their customers
making it as difficult as possible to
find exactly the right Adaro these are
very similar looking to the Adaro stereo
but the key difference here is they are
of course bluetooth controlled and
Wireless so they feature an onboard
battery once again beautiful industrial
design and considering the fact that
they're battery-powered they're really
not that much heavier than the regular
stereo skew which is impressive that's
one of the problems that I've personally
had with Bluetooth headphones in the
past most notably the parrot zieks which
are incredibly cool and a great piece of
technology but unfortunately are
extremely heavy next up we've got
something that I have been asked to say
this okay so
have to be very clear it is not a
SmartWatch it is not a fitness band
it is a smart band and I promise to say
that as on ironically as possible but I
don't think I got away with it anyway
this is the Nabu and it's a fairly
uniquely positioned product hence the
reason that they're saying it's not a
SmartWatch and it's not a Fitness band
what it is is it is a bit of a
communication device it could be a
gaming device in the future you could
play you could play tag with it you
could use it to integrate with something
like Facebook for example share contact
information with people when you meet
them because it does have an
accelerometer as we might expect from
something that's expected to act as you
know a sleep monitor a fitness tracker
and all those usual things you might
expect from a fitness band but it's a
little bit smarter than your typical
fitness band hence the smart in the name
I'm not being ironic this time in that
it has a couple of displays that allow
you to see notifications much like you
would with a SmartWatch and of course
you can read the time on it as well but
again you know we don't want to get
stuck in this the SmartWatch
functionality thing so it has one on the
top and the idea behind it is whether
it's for gaming and you're trying to
slip away from the table because you
just got a message on coms or an email
or a text or whatever else it's about
subtlety so you get one notification on
the top which might be in the form of a
little envelope for an email for example
then you have an additional screen on
the bottom so you'd flip your wrist
around and you'd be able to read your
text to get your message and then finish
your food quickly and get away to your
gaming PC where it's time to join a
league of Legends match or whatever else
the case may be so it's going to come in
two different sizes each of which
includes a spacer so the idea is that
even though this very obviously
engineering sample one that I'm wearing
which is you know hideous and obviously
too big for me so even though this one's
too big don't worry guys there will be
different sizes and it's not expected to
be a one size fits all now the reason
again that it's not being positioned as
a SmartWatch is that not everyone wants
a SmartWatch some people want a watch as
a fashion accessory and this is meant to
coexist with a watch as opposed to
replace it even though once again it has
the functionality of being able to tell
time if you so desired now we don't have
an MSRP for it yet but we're expecting a
$49.99 developer kit to be available at
sometime in the near future here so I
think especially at that price point
it's good
be worthwhile for folks to get their
hands on it and why would they need a
developer kit you might ask well because
there's already a rudimentary app that
allows you to see things like your you
can see the device you can see your
notifications your fitness and all that
stuff but ah yes an app marketplace
where there's Twitter and Facebook as
some suggested apps but Razer is leaving
things very open to other folks to
develop new functionality for their
smart band so thank you very much for
checking out this video and razors suite
remember our trip to the show was
powered this year by NCI XCOM your
