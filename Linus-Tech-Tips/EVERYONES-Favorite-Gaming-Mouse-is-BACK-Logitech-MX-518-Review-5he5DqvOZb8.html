sentiment that I think a lot of tech
enthusiasts share I mean did anybody ask
for the Metro UI Start menu in Windows 8
the thing about tech though is that no
matter how much you love it it gets
outdated so even if you thought that the
logitech mx518 was the best mouse
possible when you bought it back in the
mid-2000s and it's been working
perfectly for you ever since fact is the
industry has moved on but what if your
old favorite to get a spec upgrade
without any of the things you love about
it getting messed with
well Logitech has done just that
introducing the Logitech G mx518
legendary familiar feel whole new deal
speaking of a deal last wire with last
wire you can find out what's going on
with your PC and Android phone when
you're connected to the Internet you can
see if there's any suspicious or badly
behaving apps use offer code Linus and
get 25% off at the link below
let's start with the most obvious
difference to the absolute horror of
some mx518 diehards the finish on the
key plate has been changed from the
much-beloved
dented helmet look to a gradient metal
flake finish that the company is calling
nightfall it is a less radical design
than the original but come on guys I
think we can all agree that it still
manages to look more special than your
average office mouse then besides the
key plate there are a couple of less
obvious aesthetic changes where the
buttons used to have printed on red
labels they now have etched black on
black labels and in place of the old
five year old artwork on the fridge
Logitech logo is the bold Logitech G
logo referring to the company's
dedicated gaming brand which they
relaunched
in 2013 now feel wise the two mice have
the exact same right-handed oval shape
with depressions on each side for the
thumb and fingers to rest in resulting
in a for me anyway
very comfortable high endurance Mouse
that's easy to lift up especially the
legendary which is five grams lighter
than its predecessor with fewer larger
Mouse skates and most notably a soft
touch rubberized wrapping on the side
for extra friction in my opinion it also
gives it a more premium look actually
but this is not just a touched up
reissue of an early 2000s Mouse uh-uh
once we get under the hood all the vital
stats have been updated to Logitech's
latest and greatest hardware starting
with their hero optical sensor this
sensor is Logitech's baby it boasts high
enough performance to warrant upgrading
the already stellar 3360 sensor in the
g502 and high enough efficiency to
squeeze 250 hours of battery life out of
a single double-a in the wireless-g 305
the easiest way to appreciate this
upgrade though is
look back at the capabilities of the
original when the mx518 first dropped in
2005 it used a form factor that was
already in use by a handful of its
predecessors including the NX 500 and
the 510 but what made the 5:18 special
what made it V Mouse for gamers was not
only its higher 1600 dpi resolution but
these buttons which were actually used
for page up and page down on its
ancestors instead on the 518 they were
repurposed to allow players to step the
dpi up and down in real time a totally
new feature that other popular mice like
the microsoft intellimouse and Razer
Diamondback could not do by default 3
dpi settings were mapped 400 800 and
1600 but you could adjust these in
software in 50 dpi increments and today
the new one actually works much the same
except it comes with a 4 3200 dpi
default mapping as well as the ability
to add a fifth mapping in software of up
to 16,000 dpi which is cool I guess if
you want to mess with your roommates or
something you can also use this button
to quickly revert back to a default dpi
of your choice which is actually a new
function that used to be an alt tab kind
of shortcut the good news though is that
if you want your legendary to work the
same way as the old one in true 2019
fashion every button on the mouse is
remappable even with macros the original
mx518 was also better than its
predecessors when it came to pointer
acceleration particularly negative
acceleration for those who need a
refresher normal acceleration makes your
mouse cursor move in a nonlinear way in
other words moving your mouse 10
centimeters across your desk quickly
will cause the cursor to move really far
while moving at 10 centimeters slowly
will cause it to barely move at all now
for general desktop use acceleration was
designed to help you get to the edge of
your screen without flying off your
mouse pad all the time
it's just that it's generally considered
a bad thing for gamers because it can be
harder to train you're aiming muscle
memory when your crosshair is moving at
different speeds from one movement to
the next negative acceleration is
actually the opposite of that so you
move the mouse really fast and the
cursor barely moves at all as for the
practical use case for that one that was
more of a bug than a feature so what
made the mx518 so great then was that
the threshold where negative
acceleration kicked in was much higher
as for the legendary though it has no
threshold there's just zero mouse
acceleration period and it also lacks
another pitfall that the original
suffered from even though other popular
gaming mice like the IME 3.0 did not
despite being two years older that's
something called angle snapping also
known as smoothing angle snapping is a
feature that was supposed to help users
especially those with shaky hams or less
computer experience
move the cursor in a straight line the
idea was that if the sensor detected
that you were kind of trying to move in
a perfectly straight line it would
smooth out any deviations from that path
snapping your cursor back on course
again though this really sucks in
shooters where small deviations could be
the difference between a headshot and a
wasted opportunity now some mice at that
time had software controls for their
angle snapping with the ability to
toggle it off outright the mx518
it did not so in summary the old one had
angle snapping at all times
the legendary has angle snapping at no
times ever
Silvan as someone whose first high
performance mouse and by high
performance I mean one that cost more
than ten bucks at the local radioshack
was actually a Logitech MX duo it's kind
of hard for me to look at this
objectively
everything about it kind of feels like
home I always loved the comfortable
ergonomic shape of this lineup from
Logitech I give zero cares about the
color because my hand
on it anyway and I think the soft touch
sides are a huge improvement so if you
were to ask me should I buy the mx518
legendary I'd probably be like oh hell
yeah brother gaming was way better back
then we didn't have your
microtransactions your DLC always-on DRM
data so yeah if you loved the old one
then yes you're gonna love this one too
go for it it's great at high speeds it
tracks accurately even when we tried to
go our very fastest it's comfortable
though South paws need not apply
and it's still just 60 bucks which when
you factor in inflation is actually
cheaper than the originals $50 price tag
in 2005 that is a heck of a deal for a
well built mouse with a flagship sensor
in it however if I were to take a step
back and look at it objectively I'd say
that going back to our bit at the
beginning of this video about progress
and all that modern mice like the g502
hero for just $10 more they're not so
bad either
so if unlike me you cut your gaming
teeth on more up-to-date designs you
actually might find the more traditional
spoon grip the lack of RGB or even
indicator LEDs and the fairly basic
button layout limiting to your gameplay
so as always then beauty is in the eye
of the beholder speaking of beautiful
