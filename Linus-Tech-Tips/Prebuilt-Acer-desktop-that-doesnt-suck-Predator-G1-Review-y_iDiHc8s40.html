for the first time ever as far as I know
acer has done a prebuilt gaming rig that
ships within videos top-of-the-line
graphics card installed and the predator
g1 borrows a lot more from enthusiasts
and boutique system builders than just
the idea of packing a proper GPU inside
let's take a closer look
Intel skull Canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description inside the
box you'll get the following a predator
g1 gaming PC some extra screws and
cables a surprisingly competent set of
peripherals the mouse's clicks are
pleasantly tactile and and includes
extra buttons for back forward and
toggling between three preset dpi
settings and the keyboard is dual color
LED backlit with a toggleable gaming
mode and chi-wah mechanical key switches
mounted what seems to be a steel
backplate then if you get the special
edition launch bundle there's also a
copy of the division and this is a new
one and Acer predator themed luggage
with cutouts to carry your gaming rig
for when you travel leaving last but not
least to standard PC power cables and
two laptop power bricks and a neat
looking holder that wait a minute wha to
power bricks yes my friends the idea
that I pitched to cooling masters
product manager almost three years ago
of moving the power supply or two as it
were outside an otherwise standard
desktop chassis for improvements to both
thermals and size since I'm the genius
has officially come to life courtesy of
Acer of all people well whatever
let's see if it worked but first I need
to know if they impose limits on the
hardware that can be used in the
predator g1 so let's pop her open which
reveals a very interesting layout the
centerpiece is a core i7 6700 9k
quad-core hyper threaded CPU so no
overclocking there's 32 gigs of DDR
for RAM and a cleverly positioned blower
case fan that should draw air across the
front where a 512 gig n dot 2 SATA SSD a
slim DVD writer and a 2 terabyte hard
drive reside across the memory stick
sent CPU area and finally over the
motherboard heat sinks that cool both
the CPU power delivery modules and the
DC to DC converters that take nineteen
volt external power and turn it into the
12 v and 3.3 volt juice needed by your
computer guts not something that you
often see on a prebuilt motherboard mind
you there's not much about this
motherboard that's normal contrary to
the statement made by this unfortunate
acer spokesperson who's totally getting
called out right now like a mini ITX
board it has only a single pcie 3.0 16x
expansion slot but it's closer in total
size to an M ATX board so what is the
extra space being used for a number of
things LED headers for the three-zone
LED illumination that can be
configurated regrettably not to all
operate on the same cycle for some
reason using a sirs predator sense
software one of only a couple blody
pre installed applications by the way
there's more room for memory 6 so thanks
to its four dimm slots the predator g1
can be upgraded to 64 gigs of ram
there's power distribution for the
converted input power the inclusion of
an extra PCIe power port and cable is a
really nice touch by the way for someone
who might want to upgrade the graphics
card in the future and the very open CPU
socket area which should help the
performance of the fairly OEM looking
cooling solution that acer has
pre-installed we'll talk about how well
this works later for now there are a
couple more items to highlight in here
Acer has included an extra two and a
half inch drive cage with pre run cables
and screws in case you want to add
another two and a half inch SSD or hard
drive which is much appreciated and I
want to take a closer look at the way
the GTX 1080 graphics card is installed
so it's covered with a predator branded
shroud but the unmistakable green glow
visible from the bottom tells us two
things it's a founders edition and it's
installed upside down so a sir used a
hard PCB link to extend the PCI Express
16x slot meaning that you can't admire
your graphics card with the side panel
off but shorter links are less prone to
signal degradation and in theory the way
that they're pulling fresh air in from
the other side panel keeping it
contained then within its own cooling
zone and exhausting it out the back
should deliver really solid thermal
results which we'll get to but first a
look at the outside so the top in front
of the predator g1 features a sirs
aggressive tank tread styling that I
personally think works better here than
it did on the g6
due to the Machine smaller size there's
a power button flanked by two headset
holders for some reason the optical
drive we saw on the inside and front i/o
so an SD card reader a USB 3 10 gigabit
type C port a USB 3 five gigabit type-a
port and a couple of audio jacks around
the back the rest of the i/o is actually
pretty lackluster the three DPS HDMI and
DVI provided by the graphics card are
accompanied only by 7.1 audio jacks with
no digital output for USB three five
gigabit ports and the DC input jacks
then maybe at least partially
responsible for the limited number of
USB ports on this machine
remember that external USB devices can
draw up to seven and a half watts each
through the USB charging specification
and while the dual power supplies
confused the bananas out of my power
meter some napkin math tells us that
we're not that far off of their rated
output so then let's answer the big
question was this approach worthwhile
when silverstone just released a power
supply that we featured in our most
compact gaming pc v2 over there that's
cheaper smaller delivers 50% more power
and with some creativity should be
possible to integrate into a similar
sized chassis especially if you're
willing to give up the optical drive
well actually it's
can pretty good for the g1 while being
no louder then the graphics card would
be on its own in another enclosure or
even on an open-air test bench the
predator g1 managed to turn in better
thermal performance than its bigger
brother in spite of its much smaller
size not to mention that it's summer now
versus March when we were checking out
the g6 and it did all this while being
rock-solid stable throughout my testing
avoiding any and all thermal throttling
on the CPU and letting the GTX 1080
boost its clocks I'll be it not fully
even with a synthetic stress test
running on the CPU and the RAM
concurrently that means that whether
we're talking about light workstation
use or gaming on a conventional screen a
g-sync monitor or in VR the predator g1
will perform all of which leads us then
to a pretty interesting conclusion Acer
has learned a lot over the last few
years going from poorly balanced gaming
pcs with lackluster graphics cards and
overpowered CPUs with too much RAM -
correctly configured gaming PC's that
unfortunately suffered from OAM grade
thermal management all the way to this
compact no compromises mini gaming rig
that stood up to everything I could
throw at it as long as I didn't want to
overclock or run the drives in raid or
anything like that ok custom still has
some advantages they still have some
things to learn about making a product
really feel premium the inside should be
black to go with the black PCB
motherboard which is a step forward in
itself by the way the cable should be
sleeved and nvme m2 SSD should have been
included for a flagship product and I'd
like to see the next predator aesthetic
reimagining move to more premium
materials but with that said the main
complaints about pre-built from the
2000s crappy motherboards and power
supplies limited to no upgrade ability
and high prices are quickly fading away
which isn't to say that the predator g1
is cheap ok the price is still high but
you're getting a lot of firepower in a
surprisingly compact little down
station if you're willing to pay for it
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or even check out the link
to where to buy the Predator g1 in the
video description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one in our
community forum which you should
definitely join now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering what to watch next so click
that little button in the top right
corner to check out our latest video
