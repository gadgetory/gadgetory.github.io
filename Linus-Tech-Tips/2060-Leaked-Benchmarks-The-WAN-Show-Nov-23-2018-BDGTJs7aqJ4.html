latest we've been in a while but we have
a great show this week u.s. proposes new
restrictions on AI exports and guess
what the windows 10 1809 update bug
continues more but also r-tx 2060 leaked
benchmarks yes whoo all that and more on
the movie to show of your life I thought
you thought you meant Swedish for a
second a Swedish show yeah I don't whine
is a Swedish word means best yes
Friday
huh what is your fault
oh yeah my Friday's sure that cuz I just
happened to wear it last Friday as well
okay I put on this morning look I
probably won't be on the wine show
[Laughter]
whatever that's fantastic
it's being a fantastic our first topic
us restricting AI exports jumping right
in what the heck here we go this is
heavy so what's what's going on with
this okay
well okay let me tell you the US
Department of Commerce has proposed new
restrictions on the export of AI
technologies and the definition of a AG
technologies is pretty broad here could
include things like neural networks deep
learning natural language processing
computer vision and expert systems so
that can include the products like a
Syrian abled iPhone or IBM Watson and so
if you wanted to sell those things
abroad you need a special license okay
so yes I guess it's the subtext of the
article that we linked here original
source being from are you clicking to
the forum well no apparently this was
not set up properly so now we have cap
now it's good ya know everyone can see
the articles talking about China yeah
very unsurprisingly song in my China
okay we should have all seen that coming
critics of this proposal I think that if
the restrictions are mishandled it could
cause serious collateral damage for US
businesses like Apple and Google which
rely on China for a large share of their
profits companies it is feared Mehdi
prioritize the development of a
technology to avoid the famously lengthy
export control process don't want to go
through that yeah not gonna make ai ai
products that sounds a little tenuous to
me everyone wants to make a ai it's like
it is the
thing that is generating all the growth
especially wow this is hard too okay
that this way there we go that's right
that's actually just the way you're
pointing though wait you know this he's
there on my screen right oh I see we try
to point out him right now that guy well
I guess you just solved well it's easy
for me now yeah yeah this dude down here
that's probably very troubling for him
because if you've seen the last few GPU
launches to the last couple's GPU
launches there's been a lot of talk
about ai ai machine learning all that
kind of stuff this is going to affect
people like chip makers it's going to
affect software people is gonna affect
people who are combining the two well
the IBM with Watson it's the same with
Google IO yeah that's why pixel phones
exist because Google thinks they have an
ad John AI yeah and what are the biggest
categories for Amazon and Google smart
home everything smart home that's all ai
yeah all of it and especially Nvidia
because there's a really cool nugget
here it got 20% of its revenue last year
from sales in China mmm
because apparently the u.s. still
maintains a monopoly on having the best
chips and lots of the best chips are
made by Nvidia and so they don't want to
give up like you don't want to lose your
China sales and all that money but
that's also the company those companies
are making the most proprietary stuff
that they want to keep ankle incubated
yeah that makes sense
I wish we have remote control of that
camera right now so we could have just
panned down right pan down and so
everyone could see this guy who's off
screen right now just crawl across in
front of the in front of the scene that
would have yeah when I said incubated
I'm an insulated ah yes okay well anyway
yeah this is this is gonna be
interesting because a lot of very smart
people for a while not just Elon quite a
few smart people for a while have been
to be fair on each side of the fence
here we need to do something about AI
because it's going to be very dangerous
or people saying no we need to be fully
unrestricted because this is like the
next wave of Awesome
to come as soon as possible there's been
definitely people on each side but I
think some people are gonna be happy
about this
but I suspect they're not gonna think
this is the right thing to do
that's hard I mean like cuz people in
the Elon category the open AI category
are saying that it needs to be regulated
but it needs to be regulated globally
yes no not like trade restricted which
people are gonna get passed anyways
unless it's in terms of like commerce
but the technology yeah that's what they
passed trade restriction so it's not
going to affect those types of things at
all it's just another trade restriction
thing yeah well and for which is
probably just going to create more
knockoff culture
I wouldn't yeah this is my next
questions do you think China cares about
these like if this goes through and the
u.s. is not gonna send so much stuff to
China I don't know if they care at this
point they've already invested billions
into companies like Alibaba and Baidu
and qua way to you know get their own
chips produced domestically yeah there
that's stuff they're doing anyway and if
they can't get it from the US it's just
all the more reason to it and it's all
the more market share for their own
domestic customer come to air our
customers yeah companies yeah how many
that customers it's interesting let's
take an idea we can oops sorry about
that intro there I want to make a straw
poll and I want to see whether people
think this is a good idea or not trade
restricting good it's a big it's a cost
like let's say it's Apple and it just
means every time you if you want to sell
iPhones in China you have to pay this
fee is that on a per unit basis per
phone or is it like a flat rate for the
company let's just in Korea another cost
yeah but a lot a lot of these things are
fairly on the edge in terms of cost and
what they're trying to do is sell lots
of them and what is it what are they
doing with other products like what are
they gonna I don't like the phone is
already gonna be bought there if someone
wants to get it they can get it like if
it if it's like a trade secrets thing
it's like oh someone
flew to us in day and bought the iPhone
brought it back to China now they're all
using it looking at it probing it like
what are you preventing but one thing
they may be preventing is collaboration
between researchers the universities
could suffer from this they won't be
able to have it so YouTube I'm sorry I
can only post one at a time so hopefully
you guys get that before the chat wave
just takes it away but twitch you guys
you guys should have that link you guys
should have quite a bit of that link and
you should be fine go away please thank
you get rekt results let's see here we
go bad ok I don't know my boyfriend Jill
BFF Joe now it's my boyfriend's friend
Jill what that's old
what does that from idk my BFF that's
really original yeah I thought I'd throw
in like a super warm reference the meme
is old but it checks out yes I love it
also the Star Wars reference so yeah
most people seem to think it's bad we've
got a very considerable amount of people
not really caring at all which is not
too surprising well in our cursory
overview here that's like a lot of balls
in the air to manage I think probably it
is it is for sure we're just a tiny
unsophisticated man show we don't know
the nah stuff especially American law
stuff but yeah it seems like the people
who think it's good is a fairly low
percentage people do you think it's bad
is really big percentage but another
thing that I we consider is your
coverage on negative things we had focus
on awesome I was just gonna say reflect
that one of it is us going like cool
this might be bad so a lot of people
might just be automatically agreeing
with us yeah another one is another one
is I think in a lot of cases the
automatic reaction to things governments
do is negative mm-hmm
and I think the tech community
especially was very scared of things
that whoever might do that touches our
stuff but on the flip side of that I
think there's a equally lizard brain
reactionary thing
to China that goes in the opposite
direction stop China I'm in favor of
blocking China right so who knows I
don't know it's interesting though but I
think yeah like I think there's a lot of
polls happening with this poll maybe
differentiated pronunciations of them
maybe this proposed legislation or
whatever is one of those light-touch
regulation things where no juice it
could touch Apple and the iPhone but
they won't use it that way and what
they'll really do is use it to regulate
like weapons and cybersecurity things
things are produced domestically in that
realm that they don't want going it
elsewhere yeah yeah now we lost them all
right well let's keep going for Windows
10 yeah the update it's been trying to
update since October there's more
there's more grief it ain't over
microsoft says it has blocked the
october update on some intel pcs due to
bad display drivers released by intel
they say intel inadvertently released
versions of its display driver to OEMs
that accidentally turned off
no actually turned on unsupported
features in windows we have this
specific version of those drivers in the
in the wind dock here that you can all
check out yeah the original version of
windows 10 version 1809 released in
early October came with an issue caused
by broken Intel audio drivers but
Microsoft says this is a different bug
caused by another set of drivers oh geez
yeah no et and the fix huh Microsoft is
working with Intel to expire these
display drivers
weary of saying it including
coordinating with OEMs and will provide
an update on the resolution another
weird use of term and an upcoming update
release which was me saying great things
and there was another bug before when it
was causing people to lose their data so
all their data this is a great update
it's the update from how they're still
really convincing me to move to win
ten this so many people working at
Microsoft you're just like please can I
just have the holidays already and more
fun news architects 2016 heck yeah
benchmarks now we got actually fun new
semi leaked give me the PC hardware news
my dude
yeah well Final Fantasy 15 benchmark oh
geez oh my god if you care about this
benchmark oh my god yeah oh man however
is that every single time you go to a
website now you have to disagree to the
notification it feels it feels like the
like early 2000 late 90s like pop up
seen again yeah except you want to do
this do you want this information do you
want this to happen but I just got your
website dude this is my first time on
google chrome how here's my wish list if
you could just make it so websites
weren't or like I have to seek it or
something yeah like why does that have
to be a pop-up like I'm I don't want
notifications from like recipes.com
there's like two websites and the whole
internet I want notifications for I
personally don't want notifications from
any website I understand why some people
do I think it's a cool feature but like
I don't have it on for like tips com
yeah but you might like you might show
you how indications there and you want
something to pop up from like I don't
know calendar or hangouts or I can
totally understand turning it on Trello
for those things on like a work computer
yes or if it's like your computer at
home and you have those things off and
you turn on like I don't know social
accounts or something if you care about
those things personally I get too many
freaking notifications already just calm
down
on the computer space because that's
usually my like I'm getting work done
thing and I'll still get the
notification here and it makes the whole
internet so jank
yeah like Oh things are loading things
are popping in wait we're dropping down
to three FPS because except the cookies
except the block thing you gotta click
three buttons ville access of freaking
website anyways we're talking generally
not just specifically about Thomas
Eakins there's a feature in chrome where
I could just smoke block all and then
chrome ins do it automatically
what is this video I don't know you got
to get that money baby oh it's an ad
okay that's okay
anyways so 26 DS are coming out actually
it hasn't even been announced it hasn't
been officially unveiled we got some
weeks we don't even know if it's gonna
be called RT X 20 60 or GTX 2060 at this
point oh yeah that's gonna be
interesting
hmm but we do know the score that I got
in the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark which
was about 30 points o or 3% faster than
what the GTX 1066 a good bite faster
than an Rx 590 slower than an Rx Vega
slower than a 1070 which makes sense but
not by like a crazy amount so that'll be
interesting it being slower than a 1070
by a notable but not crazy amount is
almost kind of weird six point one eight
percent because you often find parity in
the off by ten products like you would
often find that like a 1070 would be
about exactly the same as its 2060 well
there's only one benchmark that's fair
yeah it's it's kind of an interesting
like yeah the only thing we benchmark
was phone fantasy 15 and it's Fork the
thing that has like notable problems
with benchmarks I think it has to do
with how this benchmark works that
benchmark database is kind of something
like a little bit of a like a place you
go to when you want to see early kind of
leaks yeah that's fair yeah this like am
i scroll then improperly or something so
this is only on the high preset at 3840
by 2160 rez okay so do you think that
between it and the 1070 think it would
be different if it was like this score
doesn't really mean anything to
me no well that's why I told you can
only look at it relative yeah okay so
like cool we know about where it fits in
the stack but I don't know how it
actually performs in that game or at
that resolution there's no other
comparative resolutions we didn't really
get a lot of information here no yeah I
don't know it's cool that like the fact
that they well not the fact the theory
the rumor that they have one of these
cards and it performed at that level
hopefully means that it's probably
coming fairly soon yeah but we don't
even know we also don't know how similar
to the consumer card this card is this
is presumably some engineering sample we
don't know if it's been super sick or
junk or medium there's a lot of
questions here I personally am NOT a
huge fan of rumors the only thing I'm
hoping is with numbers being out there
hopefully that means 2060s coming soon
because I know a lot of people can't
afford the big beefy cards I bought 60
series cards for for a long time their
VR ready baby
I love seeing like cases and power
supplies that RV already but yeah like I
don't know it's it's it's exciting
because it's a slightly more accessible
but still very gaming focused powerful
GPU we should get some merch that says
if you already maybe people will buy it
more than the r-tx on sure hmm
did I not do well it okay it's a little
like yeah how do you wear that anywhere
yeah you don't I mean yeah that's a
that's a home shirt yeah and you can't
buy too many home shirts yeah it's like
the kind of your wife's like you know a
little more yeah anyways obtained being
marketed as RAM that's shame on you
weird wait what well I haven't heard of
this yeah mostly is this like a someone
in marketing screwed up thing no no my
goodness
talking about friggin things everywhere
Oh God
OMS are selling laptops outfitted with
Intel obtain cash drives but they're
improperly combining that information
in ways that makes it seem as if the
option cash drive represents some kind
of DRAM rather than a conventional cash
drive so in this article they did two
tests they go they have some screenshots
here where they they google certain
keywords and they see what comes up and
the del one is more egregious twenty
four gigabytes of memory eight gigs of
ram plus oh yeah so they're lumping your
DRAM memory with your obtain cache
memory and you're calling it all memory
and then say like yeah this has 24
gigabytes of memory in this lap not even
a hundred percent if you look this is
kind of hard to see let me let me zoom
in yes gonna enhance we got to enhance
the photo where'd it go okay that's this
one so it was twenty four gigabytes
right having twenty four gigabytes of
RAM and we were just talking about
twenty four gigabytes memory eight of it
is RAM 16 of his Intel obtained on the
actual bit from Google that they got
they the embedded card if you look at
the bottom it says specifically 24
gigabytes of RAM it just says Ram it
says Ram it doesn't even say memory at
that part down here if they wrote it
like this every time I'd be like yeah
that's really too reasonable it's
confusing
but at least they break it out up here
they specifically say 24 gigs of ram
that's baloney they'll vary baloney mic
Dell looking at you boy that's not a
weird I'm hoping that's just like
someone in marketing that doesn't know
what they're talking about it's like hey
is this thing memory it's not an ever
lip up I'm hoping no I mean thanks
extreme tech I wasn't I wasn't really
sure oh I wasn't I wasn't aware I
appreciate it
they actually dedicate a part of this
article of saying why it's not an
accident really
no because multiple multiple companies
are doing it and I mean if I was a
marketer at one of these companies I'd
probably
- rude rude I mean they do have a
challenge I think it's hard enough for
consumers to understand this is actually
why they shouldn't do it it's hard now
for consumers to understand the
difference in memory and storage this
makes it even harder but how would you
advertise them have these actually
capabilities because the top team
extreme tech I will give you this this
is a pretty well laid out article I see
what they're saying now there's an
update there is an update down here at
the bottom
I wish updates win at the top that is
one criticism I will give you a stream
tax at least there's an update an Intel
spokesperson has contacted us to relay
the following message Intel obtained
memory is a unique technology the
presents a gap between remembering and
store but like RAM is more in she see
memory hierarchy by placing commonly
used data into opting memory cannot
replace dear I'm entirely yeah not even
close
however these two memory technologies
complement each other within a PC so
basically I didn't say anything nice
statement so they have an effort maybe
that's why the updates at the bottom
exactly
well Intel has an FAQ on the website
about volcana and it used to say you
should actually look at the the full
quotes that they have on the article
yeah what a q1 yes right there okay used
to say octane memory modules do not
replace DRAM and now it says octane is
similar to the function of dynamic
random-access memory you 6 well I mean I
think it still does in a different part
of the facts say that it doesn't replace
it but this is a kind of ambiguity just
kind of bolsters the advertisers to say
something that sucks here is I always
thought option was pretty cool
but it was already really hard for
people to understand and now they're
like muddying the waters more you know I
think there's a better way to explain
this to consumers I think there's many
better ways to explain this to consumers
anyone
we've well it's on the spot its cash
right so to make everything faster in a
way that sometimes Ram can't
like in assert in some situations it's
better for you than more rare but how
are you gonna do that or you then fast
around in other situations no but like
it it it's a it's a different thing so
do you think the search result in the
Google like shopping card should just
say a gigabytes ram 16 gigabytes obtain
terabyte storage and then it's up to the
users to be like to learn this new
language yeah what's up dating and after
yeah probably
cuz then they can at least look into it
telling people 24 gigabytes of uh well
okay it's even worse when they said 24
gigabytes of RAM but when they say 24
gigabytes of memory and you have taught
consumers for many years that when it
lists memory they're talking about RAM
that's kg it is that's weird
you've taught me over a long time but
that specifically means RAM when you're
looking at stuff like laptops
yeah and pre-built pcs they know what
they're doing they do shame I think this
can be done better I dunno Intel has had
a really hard time marketing obtain for
a while
it's a good name though it is that's
they could have got that way worse hey
that's super chat octane is like an
actual hardware for what used to be
ready boost put that on the results I
just like well thank you very much I
appreciate it
I just listen even the person who said
that call him out
Douglas Robinson Rob Douglas in no no
thank you very much but yeah I don't
know I think I think I think they could
have done a better job of marketing it I
think they they could have worked with
with partners in the space like us and
like other tech review well not us is a
weird thing for me to say now but like
you guys live SEC tips and other
hardware reviewers and stuff and gotten
a clearer picture of what it is and
where when it's going to be really good
because there's some situations where
obtained will make like a massive
difference in terms of performance and
there's some situations where it'll
still make a difference but not like a
huge one
and etc etc etc and making that more
obvious I think I think would be good I
don't know it's a cool product and it's
just it's gonna be looked at poorly
because of this and it's just more
confusing
speaking of looked at poorly Microsoft
putting ads in the mail app oh ma IL
mail yeah not that they have it anyway
apparently the beta version of
Microsoft's mail client for Windows 10
has been placing ads right at the top of
the Inbox though the company has since
turned off the feature and claims that
it was just an experiment meant to be
constrained to a small area it was
tested in Brazil Canada Australia and
India it's an interesting mix - yeah I
guess let's not hit the US yep yeah I
think I know it's a mix the ads were
visible on Windows homing Windows Pro
but we're not on Windows Enterprise or
Windows
edu education no breathin so is for pro
users window yeah Windows Pro it's a
home and pro okay all right I mean I now
removed FAQ page on Microsoft support
website archived here where I can bother
click on it though the company explains
that it was running a pilot program
testing ads in mail I don't serve to
non-work accounts me neither who would
set up through the mail including
Outlook calm Gmail and yahoo accounts
users who have an office 365
subscription which cost 7 dollars per
month or $70 a year like to the email
address we're not shown ads I mean kudos
to Microsoft for being really measuring
everything no not even that like I like
that they're kind of reinventing
themselves they're like they're going
back to fundamentals first principles
thinking what works what doesn't work
you know when they moved Windows to a
different business unit and all that
changing the focus of their company cool
test everything guys and they said that
their official statement was that this
was just a little test even though it
seemed like they actually had quite a
bit of like support pages and stuff set
up so it looked like
pretty serious effort but yeah no one
wants to use that app already and no one
literally don't know a single person who
uses the whoa and if someone does use it
they probably don't want to like that
they're using it like at work or
something you think yeah well no but the
a B this isn't Windows Enterprise who
uses the mail app okay hold on don't
know we know only answer this straw poll
someone needs to fix their car alarm
only answer this straw poll if you have
Windows 10 do you use the mail app in
Windows 10
can we get a yes yes you're gonna no no
and I don't use the windows 10 but I'm
here I don't use Windows 10 but I'm here
my dude yeah
create that ball all right I want to see
because like I really maybe maybe in
like a different geographic people are
crazy about Windows Mail app but like I
yeah maybe in Australia and India and
Brazil yeah I'm a just tested cattle
like Eastern Canada or something but
like I don't know anyone I really don't
know is that the blue one that when I
like when I click on a someone's email
on a website it opens up that thing I'm
not used to seeing is that what we're
talking about what's that Wow Wow that's
way more people than I expected
there's dozens of us there is dozens of
you there's a hundred and three of you
Wow holy cow at about 350 that voted
that's a lot of people are out of 450
that voted on I don't know why
okay we need to follow up pull another
new poll yeah the why default have to
like it
like default dozen I didn't change it
like laziness lazy faults / lazy fault /
lazy I have to and that's like work or
something like that they make me good
and I just like it Matthew McCauley and
those linking commercials I just like
our YouTube chat is there any ways also
can't spam it so like I don't think
anybody saw it scroll up guys if you're
in YouTube and you want to answer this
straw poll dot Emmy / 1 6 9 0 5 0 7 7 I
repeat one six nine zero five zero seven
seven you should show it that would
probably be easier can you crank into
that no you can't enlarge the toolbar
that was done you zoom in most people
just like it wow that's interesting I
just like it I find it interesting that
more people answered this one then
answered that they do use it whatever
what that is most people saying I just
like it um so should we try it
interesting I don't use Windows 10 so I
can't like this video if you think
everyone in the office should switch to
the mail app video mail and get a bunch
of ads maybe if they renamed a thing
yeah the timing will be perfect
that's um yeah I don't want you know
it's it's kind of surprised me for a lot
I mean I get it unlike a unlike everyone
should be on our services kind of way
but it's always surprised me that email
is essentially free I pretty much no one
pays for email and it's such a core
thing like if you had to you would well
you did pay at the very beginning and
then hotmail came on hotmail was the
first three
that's fair I believe yeah and then
Gmail is free because they take some
data yeah but I like it I like when they
take that data it enhances their
services sure you're all about chat
though you've got the home you've got
everything yeah I want it in your life
oh it's so bizarre you're like yeah
Google oh I got a shout me me box s in
my house not to it's like a oh man it's
a Google homeless a bye charlie you've

honey calm / Linus dude up speaking of
things to do
lab-grown meat is coming to us and a no
yes it's coming p IA alright it's a VPN
it secures you you can get apps for
Windows Mac OS Android iOS it still says
Linus in here Linus and Chrome you can
get an app for Linus I'm not gonna fix
it with several other platforms coming
soon obviously I'm in Linux I guess I
fixed it connect up to five devices at
the same time apps include DNS leak
protection and ipv6 leak protection in
Killswitch this is cool will block all
traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected
unexpectedly that's important check it
out today in the link in the video
description if you're watching the vaad
or just go to private comm / pages / - -
tip text - tips there we go private need
access ya lab-grown internet privacy
yeah i'm really this is my favorite
future technology oh yeah me too more
than their self-driving cars yeah
probably
i well i think it's more important to
have this this will be lab-grown meat I
think you know I'll give you that I
think it was if we yeah if we didn't
have to have the sheer amount of cows
look look look into the amount of cows
that are literally just around for me
it's insane I think this will have a
bigger impact on climate change then
like going is there there toots are like
methane from they burp while they're
eating tons of methane comes out of them
not to mention smoke all the water and
land just to feed them yeah it's very
inefficient you have used to make food
but in taste delicious eating super
inefficient anyway lab-grown meat can be
sweet and the US and day is getting
closer to having in stores because the
US Department of Agriculture and the FDA
Food and Drug Administration have
announced that they will be overseeing
its production so it can be sold safely
to consumers across the country the two
agencies are gonna be working together
and this has been an ongoing thing
before we're all wondering is it gonna
follow under the FDA because it's like a
technology and lab culture stuff or is
it gonna fall under the Food and Drug
Administration because you're probably I
love this stuff but I've looked into it
at least he at least a year and I think
you're probably more up on it than me
hopefully the amw burger why is that
oh the beyond meat burger yeah that's P
protein okay yeah so he's not loopy in a
bucket you you put in no I'm joking it's
from the vegetable yeah cuz that's
that's not really related to this no
it's different thing yeah it's good it's
to me it tastes like a sausage patty
more than a bird
but it's not bad it was pretty popular
yeah it's still going yeah but this this
is a whole different thing oh yeah yeah
so what images of when they were
learning to do this really early on are
like really very cool but really creepy
at the same time you know Harry they're
cool
they really have you seen Aaron they
seen I don't think it's that cool
they're just it's weird seeing meat
grown in labs
so while Luke looks that up I'll keep
reading here the two agencies are gonna
work together
that's what how it all shakes out the
FDA is gonna be in charge of regulating
the collection banking and growing of
cells used to make artificial meat
remember they start with South with stem
cells from a real animal and then they
scale that and make a giant culture from
which they can create all these
different like pieces of muscle it's not
creepy that's obviously not I don't real
know as Photoshop I can't find any cool
so there's gonna be yeah okay so the FTT
FDA has power over that part and then
the USDA is gonna work on the production
and labeling of food products production
and labeling so there's gonna be a
transition from FDA to USDA oversight
that transition happens during the
health the cell harvest stage this
regulatory framework will leverage both
the FDA's experience regulating cell
culture technology and living bio
systems and they asked the USDA's
expertise in regulating livestock and
poultry products for human consumption
I don't know so they have at least one
response from someone who works in this
field at a meat start-up at s cultured
meat startup it's called New Age meats
this person says that the announcement
here reduces uncertainty that allows us
to move forward in developing innovative
technology here in the United States
yeah I mean that's with everything as
soon as it gets regulated then you know
what you're doing okay we have to go in
this line yeah that's right the joint
framework allows us to more quickly
create safe high-paying jobs in both
research and development and
manufacturing
cool yeah really off topic here I have
to do a shout out really quick
apparently my mom works with a huge fan
the show wai-wait way to walk right
through it
you just walk with jism on walked with
confidence so I'm supposed to showed up
Mitch Fraser thanks for thanks for being
cool man a phrase and you got another
person walking by we got it and they're
gonna have to leave again at some points
is a traffic area but yeah that's very
cool I'm excited for that I like trying
all the new ones when they come out no
yeah yeah we actually went down to the
state's and tried the beyond meet know
the impossible impossible possible yeah
yeah how was it
that one was soaked was okay what are
you doing compared to beyond me
okay the thing with the impossible
burger is that it's like juicy like
South ahima in it so it's our team so
it's supposed to simulate a bloody
burger the problem with it is it's it's
almost like a hash brown and it's
texture oh it's like a bunch of like
strange like fibrous strings that are
put together like more meatloaf II so
the texture is different yeah but it's
very tasty the beyond me
yeah that one's really good I've had the
NW burger lots of times yeah lots of
times so you're like didn't do this
several times and every time I go in
there everyone in the lineup is ordering
it and I thought was just cuz I was on
Commercial Drive and Bankura select of
course but then I went to like small
town I'm here so go into mission and the
dude there was like everyone's getting
this it's crazy I wish you'd be a little
cheaper I haven't bought it anw specific
is kind of expensive it's like seven
bucks for this burger aw it's just a
suit yeah yeah yeah four would be better
apparently you can buy it like at
Safeway just at the grocery store like a
name W branded one or like on me oh yeah
okay I think they might have it
discontinued that and because what
happened was they released in a and W
and then a and W ran out there was a
supply shortage so it's possible that
the company beyond me put all the
resources to a and W and stop selling in
other places yeah I don't know this is
this is assumptions we're doing some
assumptions no no
yeah let's do it
that kind of sucks cuz you're actually
really cool but valve has the skin has
discontinued steam link hardware wah-wah
did you have one of those ever no you
ever see you want real life I did so
what the mating stock is sold out in
Europe almost sold out in the US so if
you want one now and you're in the US
move move boy so the steam link was the
hardware anyway it was a $50 little dude
and what it did was it allowed you to
stream games from a local gaming PC to a
high-definition television in the same
house yeah pretty cool yeah really cool
not bad they don't do it anymore cuz
they're all they're just focusing on the
software stop now someone in the
comments on Ars Technica calm said for
anyone who doesn't know if you have a
Samsung Smart TV you can download the
steam app onto your TV plug in any USB
gamepad and play that's really cool I
have such a TV you should try it hmm see
if it works so you've got all the
devices that are spying on you dude I
got spies
I got spies housen everyday
spying on my dog listening to my dog you
know the song I'm singing I vaguely
recognize it but not really I can't even
say this song Tyler doesn't swear in it
speaking of vaguely recognized but
Amazon Prime members can see Aquaman a
week early pretty cool
whoa pretty cool so wait you get to go
to a cinema up to a week early if you're
a prime members yeah cuz Amazon has all
these cool partnerships with cinemas
they've done that for oh is that cool
why is this a good thing well it's cool
if you're one of them and actually it's
not it's not really cuz considering it's
in a cinema it's not really a week early
it's just if you don't have it you're
banned for a week well especially
considering that the movies already
gonna be out in China in Europe by the
time this advance all happens in a bow
yeah I have only select theaters how
does it say like a hundred or a thousand
theaters in the US
that's a big difference but I wait
that's the only ones where you're banned
for a week no no no no the ones were i
guess the ones were this promotions
happening it's limited selection
theatres see but this guy this guy this
is why people want to go see it early
abuse
yeah I've seen he was in Vancouver
apparently I've met several people who
like got to hang out with him when he
was here and like I've seen selfies in
his hands like there than people's in
their head he's a monster
he's a beast yeah people in general that
are attracted to men are gonna want to
go see that movie a week early I'm
suspecting so each subscriber is gonna
be able to purchase up to ten tickets
for a 7 p.m. showing on December 15th
just under week before the film
officially opens on December 21st what
I'm wondering you produce up to 10
tickets yes do you think there's gonna
be like a resale market yes how much
would people pay but maybe not even that
much they're just gonna get scalped
people would make 5 10 bucks on each
ticket you're making if you guys 50 do
$100 hell yeah money 10 dix is a lot
people just walking by Aukerman Sleater
Lee I got tickets
anybody want tickets I got tickets and
buying tickets I'm selling tickets oh
man yes so that's gonna happen I have
1,000 participating cinemas across the
US including cinemas owned by AMC Regal
National Amusements eaters Arclight
cinemas and you can use against the book
apparently there was previous
partnerships that saw early screenings
of 2017 s Jumanji and Hotel Transylvania
3 Hotel Transylvania 3 do you know Hotel
Transylvania 3 is a good movie was it
good hell of a partnership Amazon sorry
vampires you tell me I believe it sounds
like you would be vampires
I am so vain yeah so far we've got three
people that really don't know what's
going on there's a warning see Sonic why
do I show you this page anyways see
sonic issues a warning
for potential video card compatibility
issues oof it's a very small number of
people I think people who have a focused
pus plus power supply and they soos GTX
970 Strix if you have both of these
things you may see a black screen under
heavy VGA usage ok a big yawn comes out
for if you have a focus plus and you
have Vega 56 or 64 this is a decent
amount of people depend on how many see
sonic power supplies there are because
those are very common like the 970 Strix
is a quite how common are the focus plus
power supplies is that just uh I don't
know what part of their product line
that is no idea it sound it sounds like
mid to low range
yeah plus is this focus doesn't sound
like a super like yeah I know what you
mean yeah yeah like ah isn't see Sonic's
really high in line like the Platinum no
that's the freaking rating it has like a
really cool silvery logo though yeah
heck yeah does yeah I was looking at
like JVC I wanna do car audio upgrade
for my car and I was looking at some
baby speakers this is this are we in
like fast in the Furious one release
date - hey man I haven't heard anyone do
a cardio upgrade - really like in
forever best I got rid of their car
audio department that way I can't find
it across the country get out of my face
oh my goodness there we go okay anyway
why don't like yet lower light c-prime
sounds of music good and that's their
highest up I'm assuming focus is lower
the lower one I was when I saw for the
JVC speakers was called Club James II
Club 600 it's you're like yeah it looks
like focus plus might be later like
lowest one I'm really not sure well that
means it's probably the most populous
one probably hmm
once again if you have rise and stuff
alright AMD stuff you may be getting
shafted why what cuz you have a Vega and
you get the shadow 56 at 64 but the GTX
970 is freaking insane amount of those
there's probably more 970 Strix 'iz than
there are like they get 56 is at home
specifically surprise Amazon leaked
customer info I think they did it
themselves weren't even hacked they
someone just did an own-goal
I thought you didn't want me to decline
to share further details though all they
did was email the people affected so
Amazon users to tell them that a
technical error technical error made
their name and address visible on the
Amazon Web site I don't know what part
of the website it's a big site Oh
the email says the issue has been fixed
it's not a result of anything you have
done there's no need for you to change
your password or take any action at all
my bad
your email is out there but you know
it's like getting Spain time one could
have seen that screenshot well some
scraper probably picked it up yeah
yeah oh it's not just people ninety
screenshotting than transcribing back in
the day remember back in the day when we
did have the internet but it was tedious
now Amazon has not disclosed how many
uses for effective thanks thanks what if
it was just like us the target of an
attack from a rogue agent like that guy
who quit to verify got fired from
Twitter and then shut down Trump's yeah
yeah I remember at that time for 10
minutes Samsung's transferred oh my G
Google Mozilla Firefox I'll switch
browsers if you handle this as long as
it doesn't crash I used to love Firefox
dude I have a little Firefox dragon
plushie at home I have multiple like I
see our new one though our Fox Shermer
in the new one he was at eight and they
were like yeah it's faster than Chrome
now it's sick and then it was like you
got that one right yeah try it and then
it crashed a lot
columnar I like the word columnar
columnar oh yeah because the owner
columnar transparent OLED yeah so it's a
transparent OLED and then you bend it in
a circle and now it's columnar and it
does that mean there's like a hologram
in the middle I don't think so but it
might have that effect I think it might
look like that's what I mean yeah
obviously it's not projecting it's just
an old Levis bent is this gonna be no
it's an ad so there's we know nothing
about this there was basically a tweet
from ice universe who's like a famously
kur person leaked it and in the caption
of the picture that you step there's no
video just I'm hoping is it just a video
of a picture no that's the only picture
we have that's what it was tweeted the
tweet that went along with it said
something like it could be used in
speakers and I think the kind of junk
picture this is an official no it's a
leak
I think used in speakers means like if
you've got a columnar speaker and
there's there could be like a little
columnar transparent OLED on the top and
it just does cool visualizations okay
that would be a lot more money for not
much value but sure one thing I'm
excited about is for this kind of stuff
to show up in like public areas yeah
like airports shopping malls heck yeah
cuz that'll just feel like oh I'm in the
video games I played when I was a kid
yeah where Minority Report we just run
through them all they're like hey mr. so
and so we just read your eyes and now we
know what you want cuz it's like the
idea yeah yeah that'll be cool did you
go through see a slot you were on see a
saucer were you yeah remember did you go
through the LG cavern of been do LEDs
they made it look like like a Grand
Canyon type I was wild that was cool was
the walls were all flexible bendy and
they were displaying images of like
Arizona the amount of money they spend
like a cavern Ludacris I was cool the
Roses Ludacris it's in my memory that
was worth it
for me this fair what's Ludacris the
time let's get out of here I think we're
done so yeah thanks guys thanks for
watching I did initiate it well actually
we're not gonna be done yet we're gonna
skim through yeah some super duper super
chats someone said just got a switch
with breath of the wild game suggestions
I don't they're gonna be into it but
there's a game called golf story
sounds really weird it's a golf RPG you
you start as someone who sucks at golf
and then you have to win all the
tournaments and you have to like make
money to buy new clubs and you make
money by doing jobs and you find a way
to use your golf clubs for all the jobs
so one of them is like mow the lawn and
you have to like hit a golf club at a
lawn mower and hit it in the right way
so a lot more will start and go mow
things I wish I was in the pitch meeting
for this it is hilarious it is a very
funny it's very entertaining game it's
really long you get a lot of your money
guys get it's great check it love how it
shows the currencies here yeah a sec we
got 40 SEC the 40 SEC said PewDiePie hey
why do we have this thing here for a
reason
does it know ya help him stay number one
defeat t series laser James for the win
I'm sad Linus meantime didn't make the
cut wins LTX 2019 do we have a date when
is when is it I don't know I don't know
if we have a date I don't think so
there's a website isn't there I don't
know if the website isn't updated it
means we don't have a date yet
you can probably google it I'm not sure
if the website is I'm not reading all of
the super chats I'm sorry
with the MSI 2070 arrow I TX out soon
are you guys thinking of updating the
SFF cases round up with cases that make
use of it without limiting CPU but I
don't think you ever going to know that
answer and I kind of doubt it copy and
paste I do an email bring talk about in
the writers meeting maybe okay this is
wrong I'll get that later what's the
best mail app and how do I remove
utilities like mail I would look
somewhere else for a guide on how do you
remove that stuff I don't know if you
necessarily yeah there's probably some
way to like block it what's the best
mail app your web browser probably I
think I'm over Windows as service I
think a lot of people are maybe not that
much octane yeah we are you you blocked
notice from all sites and Chrome oh cool
oh thanks goof
they were see they listened to us heck
yeah I'm gonna have to Google how to do
that sick someone said please explain
that please explain the Hat oh well this
is a hat that comes off our prop wall
which happens to be so close to the land
show set that I could hang the Hat on
the wall actually pretty close if that
was a free peg and there wasn't a Santa
hat on it
that might have worked because it was
angled nicely and everything if you were
to just played it cool we could have
told the audience that it did work not
here
hey you guys for watching we'll see you
next time
intro a bunch I'm back in the brain but
you can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
