I'm actually pretty interested in this
is the Jawbone Jambox it comes in a
variety of different colors this one is
blue wave because it has it's blue and
it has like kind of a wavy design on it
so let's talk about all of their claims
about it this is just going to be a pure
unboxing for this one guys I'm gonna be
doing an updated video on my NCIX comm
channel where I'm gonna take a closer
look at this and actually try it in the
various scenarios where jawbone says
that it's going to perform very very
well but we're just going to stick with
what's here what's neat about it and
that they're so they say killer audio
and I did the rumor of the word on the
street is that the audio is actually
surprisingly good given the form factor
and given the 4 hours of battery life
you can get out of it remember 4 hours
depends on the volume of listening at
updatable and intelligent so yes you can
update the firmware so they can actually
add features in the future and back last
year they actually added a feature that
made it perform significantly better so
it looks like they're very serious about
this blast wireless hi-fi audio from
your phone mp3 player tablet or a laptop
so anything with Bluetooth first
intelligent speaker software updates and
spoke and battery status ok you can also
see the battery life on your phone if
you want which is kind of neat party jam
blast tunes movie jam enjoy big 3d sound
on any screen size Game Jam bring gains
to life with high fidelity talk jam you
can conference so it actually works as a
speakerphone as well which is kind of
cool feel the power of earth-shaking
bass in the palm of your hand so
according to their claims is a zero
decimals to 120 domestic decimals I
meant decibels so whisper refrigerator
city traffic motorcycle Jam box at 85
decibels which is pretty impressive if
they actually achieve that so let's go
ahead and get it opened up because the
last side just says what's included in
the box and since we're gonna open the
box we don't need to look at that very
nice retail box by the way it kind of
reminds me of the Razer Mamba like the
crystal crystal top like having the the
product sort of hovering there in space
alright here we go so inside here we
find oh wow that's an amazing retail
package and I've unboxed a lot
products this is a very very nice nice
box black pages inside got all your
instructions power up get connected get
listen and get talking personalize an
update and it's all in English no it's
not okay there's French on oh okay
Spanish on the other side there you go
okay cool here's your charging cable
using micro USB 12 inches or one foot or
30 centimeters whichever you prefer
there's a other more different one
really 60-inch do they really include
just like two different size of us could
be a cable whatever is better for you
look at that
they do exactly the same thing just
shorter or longer cool thanks jumble
alright then we've got oh that's kind of
a maxi looking uh stereo cable once
again that's a 60 inch cable gray on one
side blue on the other side to match
your jam box okay cool
then we have a charger so that's just a
USB to 2 AC okay take off the label cuz
we know what that is
okay and finally a carrying case so you
can throw it in a bag or in your back
paw backpack or whatever else without
damaging it oh that's actually quite
nice I wonder if it's it's got something
in here so I wonder if it's like
magnetic or something I don't actually
know that so if that's not a feature
that I'm very sorry for getting your
hopes up but maybe that's a suggestion
for like jam box v2 that they do it that
way if they haven't already done it that
way this time okay so let's see we got
some tape here which is gonna allow us
to remove this put some tape here just
gonna allow us to remove this you've got
some clips here that are gonna last
remove that and we have extracted the
jam box from the retail packaging so I
do want to try this out just because I'm
curious so let's go ahead and throw that
in there fits snugly but not not too
difficult to put in
and it is magnetic hey hey look at that
so the whole thing is like super
protected you can go ahead and open it
up and slide it out not too difficult
that'll probably get easier as time goes
on okay and there it is so what is it
it's basically just a Bluetooth speaker
wit that they claim can achieve up to 85
decibels so you can have a very
different listening experience than
you're used to whether you're playing
games on your tablet you know you just
put it near you and you have your game
audio coming out of there whether you're
listening to music so you walk into your
kitchen or whatever and put down your
jam box you want to listen to music on
your phone instead of draining your
battery to high hell you can just stream
it over bluetooth to this guy and then
charge it up later all right that pretty
much covers it input wise so we've got
your power as well as your power off
we've got your stereo your charging so
you don't have to do it wirelessly maybe
this is power I actually don't know give
me a sec okay so clarifying a couple
things up to 10 hours of battery life
rather than four hours that I said
before so I have no idea where I pulled
that number out of once again no depends
on the volume you're listening to and
the content so you got your charging
spot here you got your stereo port here
this is power and caring so that's why
it has a number of different positions
and then up here that is your talk
button so you can use that to answer or
end a call that's volume down and that's
volume up so thank you for checking out

jawbone jam box don't forget to
