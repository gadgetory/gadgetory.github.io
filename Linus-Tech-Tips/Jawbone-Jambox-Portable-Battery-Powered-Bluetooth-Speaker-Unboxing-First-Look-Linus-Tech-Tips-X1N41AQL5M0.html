I'm actually pretty interested in this
is the jawbone jambox it comes in a
variety of different colors this one is
blue wave because it has it's blue and
it has like kind of a wavy design on it
so let's talk about all of their claims
about it this is just going to be a peer
unboxing for this one guys I'm going to
be doing an updated video on my NCIX
comm channel where I'm going to take a
closer look at this and actually try it
in the various scenarios where jawbone
says that it's going to perform very
very well but we're just going to stick
with what's here what's neat about it
and that they're so they say killer
audio and I did the rumor of the word on
the street is that the audio is actually
surprisingly good given the form factor
and given the four hours of battery life
you can get out of it remember four
hours depends on the volume of listening
at updateable and intelligent so yes you
can update the firmware so they can
actually add features in the future and
back last year they actually added a
feature that made it perform
significantly better so it looks like
they're very serious about this blast
wireless hi-fi audio from your phone mp3
player tablet or a laptop so anything
with Bluetooth first intelligent speaker
software updates and spoken battery
status okay you can also see the battery
life on your phone if you want which is
kind of neat party jam blast tunes movie
jam enjoy big three just sound on any
screen size Game Jam bring games to life
with high fidelity top gem you can
conference so it actually works as a
speaker phone as well which is kind of
cool feel the power of earth-shaking
base in the palm of your hand so
according to their claims is zero
decimals to 120 domestic decimals i
meant decibels so whisper refrigerator
city traffic motorcycle jam box at 85
decibels which is pretty impressive if
they actually achieve that so let's go
ahead and get it opened up because the
last slide just says what's included in
the box and since we're going to open
the box we don't need to look at that
very nice retail box by the way it kind
of reminds me of the razer mamba like
the crystal crystal top like having the
the product sort of hovering there in
space alright here we go so inside here
we find oh wow that's an amazing retail
package and I've unboxed a lot
products this is a very very nice nice
box black pages inside got all your
instructions power up get connected get
listen and get talking personalized an
update and it's all in English no it's
not okay there's french on oh okay
spanish on the other side there you go
ok cool here's your charging cable using
micro USB 12 inches or one foot or 30
centimeters whichever you prefer there's
a other more different one really
60-inch do they really include just like
two different size of us could be a
cable whatever is better for you look at
that they do exactly the same thing just
shorter or longer cool thanks trouble
alright then we've got oh that's kind of
a mexi looking stereo cable once again
that's a 60 inch cable gray on one side
blue on the other side to match your jam
box okay cool then we have a charger so
that's just a USB 2 to AC okay take off
the label cuz we know what that is okay
and finally a carrying case so you can
throw it in a bag or in your back paw
backpack or whatever else without
damaging it oh that's actually quite
nice I wonder if it's it's got something
in here so I wonder if it's like
magnetic or something I don't actually
know that so if that's not a feature
that I'm very sorry for getting your
hopes up but maybe that's a suggestion
for like jambox be to that they do it
that way if they haven't already done it
that way this time okay so let's see me
not some tape here which is going to
allow us to remove this awesome tape
here just going to allow us to remove
this you've got some clips here that are
going to last remove that and we have
extracted the jam box from the retail
packaging so I do want to try this out
just because I'm curious so let's go
ahead and throw that in there fit snugly
but not not too difficult to put in
and it is magnetic Hey Hey look at that
so the whole thing is like super
protected you can go ahead and open it
up and slide it out not too difficult
that'll probably get easier as time goes
on okay and there it is so what is it
it's basically just a bluetooth speaker
with that they claim can achieve up to
85 decibels so you can have a very
different listening experience than
you're used to whether you're playing
games on your tablet you know you just
put it near you and you have your game
audio coming out of there whether you're
listening to music so you walk into your
kitchen or whatever you put down your
jam box you want to listen to music on
your phone instead of draining your
battery top to high hell you can just
stream it over Bluetooth to this guy and
then charge it up later um I think that
pretty much covers it input wise so
we've got your power as well as your
power off we've got your stereo your
charging so you don't have to do it
wirelessly maybe this is power I
actually don't know give me a sec okay
so clarifying a couple things up to 10
hours of battery life rather than four
hours that I said before so I have no
idea where I pulled that number out of
once again though depends on the volume
you're listening to and the content so
you got your charging spot here you got
your stereo port here this is power and
caring so that's why it has a number of
different positions and then up here
that is your talk button so you can use
that to answer or end a call that's
volume down and that's volume up so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
