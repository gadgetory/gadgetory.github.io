this is the msi geforce gtx 480
lightning now there haven't been a whole
lot of non reference GTX 480 s but this
is definitely as non-reference as they
come it uses a custom cooler so this is
a twin frozer 3 now please note that all
of the other GTX 480 s that I'm aware of
that come with aftermarket air coolers
are triple slot this one is dual slot
and even with a dual slot cooler they've
achieved better cooling than the stock
heatsink
it also features their power for
architecture which is power for extreme
overclocking including a 16 phase PWM
which can provide yeah it's okay so it's
double the phases of a reference GTX 480
and in order to deliver a ton of power
to it you've actually got to eight pin
connectors and one six pin connector for
power
you've got Pro adelies er hmm features
incredible capacitance and crazy low ESR
so optimize the power supply for extreme
overclocking okay cool all right we've
got copper moss alright so now you
generation MOSFET with built-in heat
spreader that's pretty cool too we've
got the super ferrite chokes hi-c cap
this is all military class stuff here as
well as all solid caps triple over
voltage which we first saw with the hawk
the GTX 460 hawk Edition and then we
also have lightning power layer which is
unique PCB design for the GPU memory and
power layer eliminates power increases
power supply stability and eliminates
power noise and ripple alright so there
are lots and lots of layers all right
let's keep going down here where we have
dual nine centimeter pwm fans at is 90
millimeter dual form in one heat sinks
so good dual form one heat sinks cover
on the front and rear the PCB to dip
okay I think they mean it has a front
and a back plate and then you've also
got like a uni thing here so you've got
cooling for the vrm as well as the
memory superpipe technology which means
big fat thick heat pipes high density
fins and a nickel plated copper base
while that took a long time
I'm fortunately the back doesn't really
say anything that the front didn't
already tell us and we can finally get
this guy opened up now there aren't a
whole lot of these made so you can
consider this basically a like limited
edition all right
comes in a huge box as you've probably
already noticed and let's have a look at
what accessories we get with the GTX 480
lightning first we get a six pin to
eight pin adapter okay that's PCI
Express power another six pin to eight
pin adapter and then a dual molex to
6-pin adapter mind you if you don't have
a power supply that's already capable of
powering this card then you need to
reevaluate your build priorities here
are the plugins for the voltage check
points and then we also have a DVI to
VGA adapter as well as another oh nope
brother yeah DVI to VGA and DVI to HDMI
this card is heavy Wow alright got some
bubble wrap in there down here we looks
like we have a CD some sort that you'll
probably throw away oh here wow it
actually comes with an HDMI cable look
at that okay that comes with the
afterburner software as well as the
Nvidia drivers quick user's guide and
last but not least a lightning series
little pamphlet thing alright let's look
at the card so I'm just going to put
this back together then I can put the
part on here to demo it this thing is
impressive looking so the first thing we
see through the packaging is the
backplate that covers the entire back of
the GPU now this is okay it's
non-reference and even non-standard this
PCB you can see that the PCB clearly
goes higher than the PCI bracket on the
back of the card so you've got an
additional looks like about a 3/4 inch
layer here where they'd actually I
housed a lot of the interesting features
so we've got some components mounted
there they've got all the V checkpoints
here and then they have all of the power
plugs also on that
Rizer part of the PCB itself all right
so let's have a look at the cooler this
is a dual slot cooler as I mentioned
before and you've got about about half
of the back IO plate for rear exhaust so
that means that probably about probably
not much probably about 1/4 the airflow
from this fan here is going to go out
the back of the case the rest of it is
going to be released into the case so
you can see the ventilation here in the
back and then there's also room for the
air to exit and many other parts of the
cooler so you can kind of reach down
there here you can see the super pipe so
we've got one big long super pipe here
and then we have another shorter super
pipe so those are the thick heat pipes
and then we also have several regular
heat pipes this uses a PCI Express 16x
interface so that's one of the only
standard reference things about this
card all right you can clearly see the
unison here so if you actually removed
the Twin Frozr three cooler from the top
of it you could probably mount GPU only
blocks and as long as you've got some
airflow over the card I'm sure you could
actually run it that way you've got two
sli fingers which means we've got
support for two-way as well as 3-way
crossfire there's a nice little MSI logo
here so you can see that the GPU is
actually right under there that's why we
do have some ventilation holes here all
right we've got some more VRMs here
we've got more ventilation holes here
and what are we actually cooling with
this thing I'm just trying to look under
the backplate to see if I can I don't
think it's actually cooling anything I
think the point of it is more for
aesthetics than anything else so in
terms of connectivity options you once
again we are non-standard we have gold
plated connectors and we have a variety
of different flavors we have two DVI
connectors one HDMI and one DisplayPort
and what else we got here okay we got
more heat pipes up at the top I think I
already showed the top one we just got
kind of some good angles of the card and
you cannot you can sort of check it out
for yourself here actually here Oh
you should probably remove the plastic
shroud right yeah
that there you go now you can see it
better and completely slipped my mind
there we go
so now you can see the Twin Frozr - and
all of its glory
there's the 90 millimeter fans you can
see the aluminum fans are very dense so
what that means to me is that these fans
probably have to generate a pretty good
amount of static pressure in order to
get satisfactory cooling on this card
very impressive
also large that is all don't forget to
