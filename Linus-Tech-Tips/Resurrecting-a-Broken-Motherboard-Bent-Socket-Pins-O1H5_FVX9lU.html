X 399 motherboard for AMD's thread
Ripper CPU it was returned to me from
one of the writers and I was informed
that it no longer works okay well this
is going to be on it's a pretty
anticlimactic here I fixed it
HP's new Olmecs lineup comes equipped
with until seventh generation core i7
processors check them out at the link
below so what you observe just there was
one of the many peculiarities when it
comes to bent pins in a modern LGA type
CPU socket it can manifest in any number
of ways a failure to post altogether and
inability to detect memory insert it
into certain slots that ones actually
very common or the system can appear to
be functioning completely normally all
cores detected all 128 gigs of ram
detected the reason for this is that
every CPU pin has a slightly different
function some of them are wired directly
through traces on the motherboard but
you can actually see there's tons of
traces around a CPU socket to a contact
point on a memory slot some of them
serve redundant purposes like to act as
a a ground pin while others may have no
functionality whatsoever like they might
be reserved for a future CPU that might
go into that socket with some feature
that might not ever get implemented so
that is why the symptoms of a bent CPU
pin can be as obvious as the system not
lighting up at all or as subtle as
slightly less stability when you're
heavily overclocked so one way or
another we need to fix this pin so no
big deal Linus send it in to the
manufacturer for repairs right wrong
first of all physical damage to the
product is not covered by any
motherboard manufacturer that I'm aware
of
and they all consider socket damage to
be physical damage and number two is an
out of warranty repair to a CPU socket
can cost as much as three hundred and
fifty dollars that's what I got quoted
when I wanted to repair a saw
get on an x 99 ews motherboard even
though it was a $400 board I'm not gonna
run out and spend three hundred and
fifty dollars so that I can have a B
stock board when it cost me fifty more
dollars to just go buy a brand new one
so then with that in mind what do you
need to repair your own bent socket pins
really with a steady hand and a sewing
needle you can probably do a pretty good
job but I've used everything from a
pocket knife to a sim removal tool to a
thumbtack in order to bend back pins and
I've done it with all of those with
success I even used the pointy tweezers
from an eye fix-it kit ones for today
we're gonna be using these picks that I
actually just found here in the workshop
organizations beautiful right so much
time in the future it was super exciting
and we're gonna be using these helping
hands with a magnifying glass something
that I also recently bought just in case
someone back to socket pin and they did
so one of the trickiest parts of any
socket repair operation is figuring out
where the bent pins are the best way to
do that is to get down low level with
the socket so that you can see whether
it's straight across this way straight
across that way or at a diagonal you can
see the gaps between the rows of pins
that's gonna make it easier for your eye
to pick out any imperfections for our
case we know exactly where it is so
we're going to get up above it now we
need to assess the damage so we're just
gonna prod at it a little bit and this
one seems pretty obvious so you can see
there's an even row of pins here an even
row of pins here and then here there's a
missing one now if this pin was broken
off we'd be in much rougher shape right
now but you can actually see that it's
not it's just bent down so we just got
to find where it bent down to looks like
looks like it's done right there wow
that is that is dug in pretty deep there
now there is always a risk when you're
working on something like this that you
will accidentally bend some other pins
in the
us as long as you're careful it
shouldn't happen hmm this pic might not
actually be fine enough for me here I'm
gonna go back to my trusty knife I
actually use the knife more often than
you'd probably think for this sort of
thing so you want something that you can
use to get under the pin and pull it up
there so you can see I've pulled it up
off the bottom now but it's not quite
aligned with the other pins so the
chances of it making perfect contact
with the pads on the bottom of the CPU
it's pretty low
now that we've pried it up from the side
the easiest way to attack it now is to
go at it from underneath head-on that
way you can over bend it up a little bit
so you want to come under it this way
now and over bend it up a bit
because it's metal so you can't just
bend it to exactly where you want it and
then expect it to stay there okay cool
that was exactly the desired result
there is we bent it up a little higher
than we wanted and it settled right back
in exactly where it's supposed to be so
now we can check the alignment of the
pins and we see a nice little bright dot
exactly where we expected perfectly
aligned let's go test it and we're back
the system works very good Linus you
fixed a working motherboard ah I have
another trick for you up my sleeve this
is a sacrificial board from a project we
never did because someone a different
member of our writing staff didn't
realize that this motherboard wasn't
gonna fit into any standard cases so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
simulate what would be a pretty common
way to damage a CPU socket lips help you
sexually accidental dropping the CPU as
you go to install Oh
okay yeah we definitely hit one let's
try again
okay I'm having a pretty hard time
mangling the sake here oh now that that
is a bent socket let's try and fix it
shall we
something people might notice about the
second round of repair here is that I'm
not even necessarily gonna try and get
it exactly perfect because what you're
gonna realize is that the contact pads
on the bottom of the CPU are actually
reasonably big I mean they're not a huge
you still need to get pretty darn close
but if you are pretty close and you
remember too that when you put the CPU
in it pushes down into the LGA the land
grid array then as long as you're good
enough that once it gets pushed down a
bit it'll be in pretty much the right
spot then you should be good enough
whoops I stopped over here is probably
still a little bit too far out of
alignment now you want to make sure that
you don't bend them down and up and down
and up too much because if you do that
they lose their strength and can
eventually break off you can recover
from that I have done it by
straightening out the shape of the pin
as long as there's enough left to get to
the contact point but it's not a sure
thing and I did end up with a board that
I snapped off the top of the pad and was
not able to resurrect another key thing
to watch out for when you're looking for
bent pins is that there are places where
pins are missing intentionally so it's
always good to double check against a
socket diagram like see this corner
right here there's no pin there that's
fine or another perfect socket that you
have on hand okay moment of truth time
okay there we go
fat beef is a good sign
and see if you detected two gigs of
member yeah that's right
repaired motherboard so that's pretty
much it guys
how to bring your motherboard back from
the dead assuming that there aren't
other issues on it like blown capacitors
or fizzled out resistors and thanks for
