quick unboxing of the g.skill falken 2
so this is a seita to two and a half
inch solid state drive like most of the
other SSDs out on the market it is
faster than a hard drive and it is also
more power efficient and more reliable
etc etc so enjoy your quiet fast cool
reliable and power-efficient g.skill
solid-state drives this particular drive
is rated for 220 megabytes per second
reads and 110 megabytes per second
rights but that's not actually the most
important special the important thing is
the random read and random write
performance of an SSD and this one uses
the in delinks bare foot controller so
that means that you're going to see
performance similar to other into links
based drives such as the ocz vertex
azure the corsair x-series so the falken
two comes in a little padded black book
shaped thing so we open it up here and
let's see what we get for accessories we
get a piece of paper so this is a user
guide and the user guides say oh I love
this installation nice do you think the
user guide was written by Nvidia I think
that's very funny anyway it gives you a
general idea of the specs and the
installation procedure for your drive
and that is pretty much it and then you
get the oh oh no there's something else
but wait there's more attention for
firmware upgrade use only actually this
is a really interesting thing to talk
about because do you feel falken two
drives you can update the firmware much
like many of the other in delinks drives
in order to get better performance
sometimes as well as new features so
many of the in delinks drives on the
market these days have actually been
updated to add trim support so trim is a
very important feature supported by
windows 7 that allows your solid state
drive to perform in a like new level of
performance even after it has been used
because with the early SSDs you'd
actually see a significant performance
degradation over time as you filled it
up so here is the drive itself we can
start at the back where we have the SATA
2 power as well as our SATA 2 data
interface and you can see these two
little pins right here are exactly where
that jumper would go when you follow the
correct procedure to update the
where and then on the back of the drive
you can see we got our Rojas it's to
habits reaffirms the spec so it has a 64
mag onboard cash much like most of the
underlings drives on the market okay
you've got your four mounting holes down
here at the bottom as well as your for
mounting holes on either side so this
drive can be installed in probably about
99% of notebooks out there that except a
two and a half inch drive you've got a
nice sort of matte black finish on the
top of the drive with a g.skill Falcon
sticker thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the g.skill falken to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
