2013 we're here in the Asus notebooks
sweet while notebooks and tablets and I
think you're gonna see that the line has
been somewhat blurred between those
categories based on what we're about to
show you here today welcome to Linus
tech tips at CES 2013 our trip to the
show this year is powered by Corsair
maker of quality PC components and
peripherals our trusted storage partner
is Seagate technology and our trusted
networking partner is Linksys
so right here is the Thai tea one and
the Taichi 31 the Taichi 21 we've sort
of seen before it's an eleven point six
inch tablet with 10-point multi-touch
but did I say tablet did I say no but
see I'm getting confused already because
it is a notebook it is a tablet and
you've got a wide variety of different
ways that you can actually interact with
it so see how quickly wakes up from
sleep too
so check this out guys we're gonna go to
the desktop here so we're gonna click on
that and I'm gonna show you guys some
really cool so think about all the ways
you can use this this is an ultrabook so
it's super portable you're a sales rep
you're a photographer you want to be
able to show someone something quickly
without doing the old well here let me
work on this and let me show it to you
over there now I can't see what they're
doing it's it's it's not very it's not
as interactive so now what you can do is
you use this button right here to decide
how you want to use it you press the
Enter key boom now it's a 10-point
multi-touch tablet these are two IPS
screens that are built into this
notebook here so the viewing angles are
fantastic and the brightness as we've
come to expect from Asus I mean look
look at something like TF 700 just
fantastic is love meets expectations but
I guess that that doesn't sound as good
as it actually is
now the next mode you can do is check
this out mirror so now there's the
presentation scenario I'm talking about
instead of it just being a tablet now
it's got a tablet side where you can
interact with it through touch but that
exact same thing is now showed on the
non touch side where you're expected to
interact with a keyboard and a touch pad
last but not least this guy right here
so this is an extend mode basically what
you're doing you're taking that screen
on the back and pretending that it
swings out this way so it's an extended
desktop so you can do something like if
you're sitting working the kids are
bothering you I mean they're they're
distracting you in some way you go look
sit over there where I can see you they
wrecked something they're in timeout you
go look okay fine here watch a movie
drag it over to the other video or to
the other screen maximize it boom you're
watching a video over here so four
different ways you can you
this guy right here is a new version so
now it comes in a 13.3 inch size still
Full HD so 1920 by 1080 and basically
more of the same so let's get some let's
get some really nice sort of glamor
shots of this remember guys this is an
ultrabook in spite of the fact that asus
has built another screen a piece of
glass which adds to the weight adds to
the thickness this is still needing the
intel Ultrabook specification while also
being a full-blown Windows 8 tablet now
very very very cool stuff on this side
you can see we've got a few different
things here so give me one moment I'm
gonna find out what this little button
does asus is finding out for us but we
actually figured it out already so what
this does is it completely disables the
back screen so even if you accidentally
hit one of the the hot keys to change
the screen modes on it it will just not
go to that one it keeps it it actually
keeps it off
so other than that we've got power we've
got indicator LED micro HDMI VGA that
you can output with an adapter super
speed USB 3 remember guys super speed
USB 3 or Thunderbolt our requirements
you have to have one or the other to get
the Ultrabook status from Intel we have
another super speed USB free so AC
system not one but two of those finally
SD expansion volume control remember
it's you need a dedicated Hardware
volume control switch because of the
fact that it is both a mill book and a
tablet so thanks for checking out our
coverage of the Tai Chi 21 and Taichi 31
