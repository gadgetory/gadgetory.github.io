that separate a and D from Intel in the
CPU market these days here are just a
few product called thread Ripper a MDF
Intel no gigantic package AMD yet Intel
no debuted LTX MDS Intel no but if the
name and the sheer size and girth of
AMD's new socket TR for platform isn't
enough to sell you on it then stick
around because we're about to open it up
and see if what's inside Rip's teen blue
a new one the be quiet dark bass pro 900
s modular design supports a variety of
different layouts and configurations

Ripper AMD's latest and greatest in more
ways than one release for the Zen
microarchitecture that threatens to hit
Intel where it hurts the high-end
desktop and workstation this is a really
big deal because the last time amv had
any punching power in this weight class
Opterons we're still a thing people
wanted to buy and you could still get a
decent AGP graphics card it can be
argued that rise in 7 positioned against
the core i7 6900 k had a lot of appeal
but it lacked per thread performance and
more importantly perhaps the many PCI
Express Lanes that professionals have
come to rely on while thread Ripper is
actually clocked similarly to rise in 7
and makes use of the same modular ccac's
design and infinity fabric interconnect
by amping it up to 4 CC X's across 2
dies we now get a total of 64 PCI
Express Lanes
that is 20 more than Intel shiny new
core I 9 and even
retton's Intel Xeon server processors
who currently enjoy just four more lanes
than their core i9 counterparts and in a
world where GPUs are critical to
high-end compute performance like
rendering and scientific research 64
lanes
gets you high speed connections to a lot
of them three GPUs by themselves at 16x
speeds would saturate a core I nine or
Xeon completely while on a thread Ripper
based system you're going to have room
to spare to be fair to Intel their
rationale is that there's not many
scenarios where this is a big issue but
AMD's betting and we believe they're
right on nvme storage high speed
networking and high performance external
accelerators even GPUs becoming more and
more common as time goes on the with
that said there is no word yet on
Thunderbolt support in any AMD ecosystem
what is supported on all AMD Xen based
platforms though are the usual suspects
like sin semi precision boost and XF are
which allows Red River to determine the
optimal performance state voltage and
power limits on a millisecond scale and
even boost performance further if the
cooling is good enough old news perhaps
but it's an important distinction from
Team Blue whose high end desktop and
Xeon processors have traditionally led a
generation behind their mainstream chips
in terms of power management well
alright then Linus thanks for the recap
tell us something we don't know we'll
get to that first a closer look at the
chips launching today the 1950 X clocks
in a whopping 16 cores and 32 threads
with a massive 40 megabytes of cache it
achieves this by gluing together two Zen
dies of two CC exes each what's perhaps
even more interesting is its little
brother the 1920 X which still enjoys a
numbers advantage over the more
expensive
Rai 979 hundred ex at 12 cores 24
threads and still 64 PCIe lanes so we
slotted both of them quite literally
this new mounting mechanism is banaynays
into an asus zenith extreme with 32 gigs
of trident zr gb ram and a thermal take
ring RGB cooler as for competition all
three of our other test benches will be
represented x2 99 z 270 and x3 70 and as
for performance well surprisingly our
1950 X actually beat out the competition
in rise of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex
mankind divided but then fell well
behind the pack along with the 1920 X in
cs:go not quite sure why that would be
but it pulls up alongside team blue
again in our synthetics so maybe we'll
chalk it up to the ongoing game engine
optimization for risin that AMD has been
shouting out or just another source
engine quark to throw in the pile moving
on to productivity benchmarks this is
where it gets really interesting
while our synthetics show thread Ripert
more or less trading blows with the core
i9 even in multi-threaded workloads when
we get into rendering with Cinebench r15
and blender our 12 core 1920 x is
competitive with the core I 970 900 X
and our 1950 X is way out front like by
a lot our 2 thread Ripper CPUs also had
the lowest performance drop during our
combined streaming and local recording
test with OBS in cs:go beautiful so
what's the catch Linus does it light up
like a roman candle do we need a pocket
nuclear reactor to power it well if
you're overclocking actually maybe more
on that to come
but at stock speed thread Ripper manages
this kind of multi-threading performance
at roughly a dozen more watts and ten
more degrees under synthetic load
compared to the core I nine and at these
prices the value proposition
especially for professionals is
outstanding for gamers
unless you're streaming or 3d rendering
at the same time your gaming red ripper
isn't going to be the best value but for
pros it's frankly starting to look like
a no-brainer if your workload relies on
multi-threading performance or lots of
adding cards now it remains to be seen
how team blue will react if at all but
given their negative press against
Andy's epic and thread Ripper products
for data center and workstation use it's
safe to say they're beginning to feel a
little hot under the collar but that's
okay until Andy's got a red ripper that
can help you with that get it to joke
you could rip the fabric whoa our
buddies at cable Mod bought an LT T
integration business must be good and
for good reason they're great people and
they make great products and they've got
a new product to announce today they're
sleeving kits for a iOS they let you add
the same cable on vibrant colors to your
all-in-one liquid cooler that you
previously could on your cables and they
are color matched so your aio tubing can
actually match your mod mesh cables
installation is super easy you don't
have to disassemble your cooler or
anything like that you just wrap mod
wraps leaving around your a i/o tubing
and complete the look with the included
fastening clips so check them out and
maybe by one by one at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys that this video suck you know what
to do but it was awesome get subscribed
hit that like button or check out the
link to where to buy the stuff we
featured in the video description also
linked in the description of our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
