looking into whether or not premium PC
cooling fans were worth it this raised
another question however one that some
people are actually rather uncomfortable
discussing is aftermarket CPU cooling
even worth it I understand why this can
be a difficult conversation people often
don't like pert their purchasing
decisions coming to question but in 2015
with much of the hardware development
world going to less power draw and lower
thermal output is it needed anymore
let's find out and stay tuned for a
course for gaming update coming soon
where we'll explore how many CPU cores
are really needed for gaming in 2015 the
Coolermaster Nova touch tkl utilizes
exclusive hybrid capacitive switches
powered by topor and is now available at
a more affordable price click now to
learn more many a time in the history of
PC builders a young Jimmy or Jane has
sat at the checkout window wondering if
they should spring for a better CPU
cooler at the cost of a weaker component
elsewhere hours have been spent
researching this question but to no
avail
whatever shall they do if they're not
interested in overclocking or aesthetics
the obvious answer is just to stick with
a stock cooler and invest elsewhere but
if they want to overclock is it worth it
how much is worth it there are a lot of
potential avenues to look at this from
when we won't be exploring is custom
water cooling loops they are too
expensive although there are some
exceptions they perform better although
there's some exceptions you get the
point essentially custom water cooling
is an extreme variable because it's well
custom there's a metric ton of benefits
to custom water cooling but many of them
come at the cost of well cost at PAX
East 2015 under the top 5 gaming
desktops of the Intel booth video one of
the system's shown in that video the
main gear one had around a thousand
dollars in just fittings alone now I
know not everyone's doing that and if
you are you know what that's freakin
awesome and
you're interested in that that's great
please place your build in the build log
section of the forum because it's
probably going to be beautiful and I'm
probably going to want to see it but
this video may not really cater to you
I personally water cool custom water
cooling but I spent about a quarter of
that on my whole setup including all the
fittings and everything and I expect
most people that are newly getting into
water cooling will be getting
top-of-the-line processors anyway so the
whole is it worth it question is less
likely applicable to them because
improved water cooling is directly on
their cpu performance upgrade path now
if someone is getting a processor that
does have potential upgrades now we're
talking we will be testing as a cooler
master t4 in order to represent a fairly
average example of a low to mid range
air cooler at about 30 ish dollars and a
cooler master sidon which will represent
the dual 120 millimeter rad and the
similarly performing large dual air
tower coolers like the Noctua and HD 15
at around 100 ish dollars last and
definitely least in terms of performance
is the general run of the mill no frills
Intel stock cooler which is bundled with
your processor the antagonist in the
story will be the Intel 4690k and
extremely commonly recommended and
purchased processor that we'll be
testing these coolers at three different
settings one is the stock setting of a
3.5 gigahertz base frequency and a 3.9
gigahertz boost frequency and next is a
slight gigahertz overclock of all cores
running at 4 gigahertz but a pretty
hefty voltage increase running at one
point to 5 volts and lastly it will run
into another slightly higher frequency
of 4.3 hereit's and a heavier voltage
increase of 1.3 5 volts please note that
you could run these voltages and get
much higher clock speeds
I was simply cranking up the voltage to
turn up the heat next up we have the CMT
4 and before you comment down below that
I'm a horrible human being because I
didn't use the hyper 212 Evo I know I'm
sorry we somehow don't have one in
office I honestly have no idea how linus
has gone this long without having one in
stock yeah anyways it's slightly more
expensive and perform slightly better
than the t4 and as you can see the
general message would have
we been somewhat similar overall the
1.35 volts overclock resulting in a 95
degree processor and some throttling
wasn't great but this small upgrade
allowed us to run at one point to 5
volts at essentially the same
temperatures as the stock cooler at
stock speeds and voltages on the CPU a
solid improvement for just 28 bucks
lastly we have the side into 40 this
cooler was able to achieve a very nice
stock speed load temperature of 47
degrees and tied the stock coolers stock
clock thermal output but at one point
three five volts giving you a lot more
room to play with but the side 240 has a
really awkward price position when
compared to a 4690k because of 4690k is
240 dollars and a 4790k which is
hyper-threaded and has a much higher
boost clock with 4.4 gigahertz
it's $340 exactly a hundred dollars more
very similar pricing to a side into 40
in conclusion is it worth it I'll give
you a solid maybe from the raw
performance numbers it looks like if you
don't want to overclock don't upgrade if
you want to overclock but don't have a
ton of budget get something like a hyper
212 Evo if you have a fair amount of
budget upgrade your processor or if
you're already at the top of line just
get whatever your budget allows but
that's not the whole story either is it
some people care a lot about aesthetics
I could call them shallow but I do as
well maybe I'm shallow I don't know and
then there is some solace junkies as
well I know people that run custom water
cooling setups for just their entire
systems and don't even have an overclock
they just do it so they can turn their
fans and their pumps super low and run
their computer at a whisper-quiet level
what solution is best for you for me
it's custom water cooling I've had a
bunch of my kit for a while so upgrading
doesn't really cost that much money I
really like the aesthetics and it's just
fun are you someone who's going to try
save a bunch of money and not buy an
aftermarket cooler are you going to go
for like the affordable but kind of
badass get a little bit more out of your
processor range or are you pretty much
already up there and just want something
cool and easy let me know in the
comments down below or even if your
custom water cooling which is super vast
comments down below
over on the forum either one totally
works let me know also down below
this video you'll be able to see a
linked for shirts that are definitely
not a twitch plays pokemon shirt
although twitchplayspokemon was awesome
nostalgia anyways over on the forum as
well there should be a support us link
where you can change things like your
Amazon affiliate links to our affiliate
codes so we get a small kickback
whenever you buy things over there which
is actually super helpful and there's
tons of other ways to support Linus
media group as well like going on the
forum or watching videos anyways thanks
for watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
