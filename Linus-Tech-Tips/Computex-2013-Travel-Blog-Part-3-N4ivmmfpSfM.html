powered by Western Digital our trusted

XCOM
I'm sorry
let's say I do
good job slick okay so here we are at
the we're discussing well thanks for
that hey have you learned how to century
yet no go away no screens and stuff
check out this candy coat it
all right Perry Toby no tomatoes hold on
what what is this supposed to mean if
I'm stinky tofu so I started to feel
sick I think I wasn't the only one so
we've moved on we're gonna try taiwanese
fried chicken we're definitely going
over the box on this one yeah it said
yeah it smells like a like a pungent mix
of livestock manure and
yeah I'm hoping the taiwanese fried
chicken is ready
there's the pink and purple guns that
obviously everybody needs
oh there's one on the wall over there I
wonder if it's like tied down
guess we'll find out nope
all right so only forty five hundred
forty five hundred whatever those are
$50 150 bucks that's not too bad for
like a pink gun I could like close with
it
bikini probably gave her a Brit
the only one I actually like thank I'm
telling you tell me more about how
you're a wuss waters waters - ha Oh
your feet are red poor little baby so
this is my first foot massage there's my
ugly feet
apparently I get 30 minutes of foot
massage
there's looks like we feet so this would
be new and different okay there's diesel
hooking up the camera with all the you
know new monitors that are attached to
it
and here's b-roll our B cameraman and
slick our B host our B host that looks
way better than me now that's a nice tie
clip you've got there are you sir can't
focus on it mind you it's too shiny
awesome we're not sure whether this is
whether this is like not touching a lot
of cultural significance here in Taiwan
so I'm actually not quite sure what they
were going for here I don't know if PC
for personal computer records for
political correctness because this is
the first time I've ever seen Asians
different why are you so excited about
this exactly well for one I don't know I
do know that there will be two casters
here are ptosis and tasteless and oh my
god this is gonna be awesome it does
make sense if you want to get somewhere
more quickly sure yeah so the taxi
pickup evidently requires me to keep
going straight and then go around this
way or I could go the way diesel in it's
just clearly faster so I think our cab
driver is actually watching TV right now
to see the GPS is up there on the left
and that just appears to be like a show
I mean we haven't crashed yet sort of
like Wild West in terms of this there's
a whole episode of self-park about like
ear sex I think their eyes
yeah we're just we're discussing Taryn
southern because hi turn southern if
you're watching this I'd really doubt it
hi Kanye West if you're watching ha ha
ha so - how was your fanboy starstruck
you know you know what I you know what I
think I think that there are much much
less awesome people that I could be
starstruck by like I don't know there's
this weird gamer that hasn't won Jack
all in the last while that Diesel's like
nerdgasm in over what says what's his
name like stinking prime or something
like that
he's bringing crime and he was huge it's
not one yeah you hear that word was
that's that's from his biggest fan so
that should be all you need to know he's
built he's building up the suspense
that's his plan I'm gonna be the
comeback kid
exactly be the comeback king yeah yeah
change from brain King friend to the Mad
King fun comeback King friend because
you're so far gone now that it's almost
hopeless that's not the first time
that's happened if you can turn it well
no even if unofficially no it's not to
millions oh it's one lane because you
drive in the middle of both of them I
wasn't I wasn't even recording any of
that Oh top rap yeah okay show me the
door apparently wasn't recording this
you just fixed the door handle okay well
beer all rip the door handle off and
then and because he's just a brute of a
man and then slicks a carnivore and that
somehow relates to his strength and I'm
summarizing what was actually really
funny the first time recording but we're
not actually recording the line this is
this is a true comedy of errors right
now you can tell the story now
well apparently just because I've looked
a certain way everyone assumes that I'm
the longview speaks Mandarin
whenever I'm paired up with as opposed
to him they assume you speak Mandarin
you don't even look Chinese though okay
so tell me tell me about this used to
cut your own hair okay
why hey nobody knew I can lay on there
so that just means or it means favor to
bike No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
