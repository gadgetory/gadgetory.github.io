580 D s now that is not to say dual
screen because all GTX 580 s support two
monitors that is their custom version
which includes a dual fan cooler that
looks pretty sweet it's actually very
similar to the dual fan cooler that is
on the GTX 460 to win or twin that dual
460 card so this is a super clock card
which is good
super super clocked is better and for
the win is best for the win is usually
quite expensive so a super clocked or
super super clock card often prevents a
very good value actually no one go ahead
and here stayed there yeah thank you
crazy Russian is helping me today he
doesn't have quite the camera expertise
that the cameraman does so I have to I
have to help him
position himself correctly okay let's
see what else they have to say for
themselves about this particular product
so you VGA warranty for more terms of
this so this is an AR product which
means it qualifies for lifetime warranty
if you register it on the EVGA website
EVGA precision is obviously compatible
with this card that's an overclocking
utility they also have an OC scanner
utility that you can use with this card
one Austria and EVGA 24/7 tech support
so whether it's night or day you can
call up EVGA at any time and get help
with your card and let's see what else
they have to say for themselves on the
side of the box there another number one
seller of Nvidia based products in the
US number one in reliability and service
of graphics cards Asterix something
something something okay number one
performance leader in 3d mark 11 Asterix
something something something and
folding at home team number one folding
at home team in the world something
something something asterisk asterisk
asterisks so they are qualifying their
statements you will or I'd rather they
are backing up their statements you can
give them that that is for sure
alright so the first thing we find in
the box is a pretty wind posture that
has a big old skull guy on it
there we are
if I can actually get the poster to come
on
unfold the hair we are so we have a
skull guy here okay the next thing we
find inside is a graphics card user
guide which will show you how to plug
the power into your graphics card how to
plug in your graphics card all that good
stuff a Quick Start Guide similar all
right GTX 580 so shows you how to plug
in the eight pin and six pin power
connector it also tells you please allow
your graphics card to cool for a minimum
of two minutes after turning off your PC
before touching it
powered by EVGA sticker EVGA disk which
you shouldn't use you should download
all the latest tools and utilities off
the EVGA website and the latest drivers
off the Nvidia website next we have a
mini HDMI to HDMI cable this is better
than an adapter because it means that
the HDMI like if you have an adapter it
means that the HDMI cable can get in the
way of the next over DVI slot so this is
a very nice addition we also have a DVI
to VGA adapter please please don't use
that get a better monitor and to or
rather one dual molex to 6-pin PCI II
and one dual 6 pin PCI II to 8 pin PCIe
finally the card itself let's that over
make ourselves a little spot alright so
there is the GTX 580 DS so it has dual
eighty millimeter fans and I can't tell
if these are PWM controlled fans
although I would assume they are yes
they are PWM controlled fans they have a
huge gap in the shroud you can see that
there's almost no restriction to the
airflow that is available to these fans
so you don't have to worry about even if
you install a card in the next over slot
you can see that the curvature of the
cover makes sure that even if something
is right up against
you're gonna have a lot of room for
those fans to draw in air that's a very
smart design choice that EVGA has made
the top of the card looks really slick
and it looks like this actually lights
up would be my guess let me just see if
I can see any power going to it anywhere
okay I can't so that's still a guess yes
I can
there there's power so that lights up
blue by the look of things which is
gonna look just sweet in your case like
that all right
it's got your standard six pin and eight
pin PCIe connectors up here in the top
as well as support for up to four Way
SLI with dual SLI connectors at the top
of the card moving around to the back of
the card you see absolutely nothing
interesting on the bottom of the card
you see exhaust vents so what that means
is that this is not an external exhaust
card it's gonna kick a little bit of
heat out the back of the card you can
see there's a nice open backplate there
but most of the heat is going to be on
the inside so what that means is that
well suck it up princess make sure you
have a case but it has decent cooling on
the inside because if you have a really
stuffy case it's not gonna kick all the
heat out what they're doing is they're
compromising the overall internal case
temperatures and they're counting on
anyone who buys a GTX 580 to have a good
gaming case with decent fans and they
are Sacre to get better performance on
cooling the GPU itself which will give
you better overclocking and a more
stable longer-lasting card okay so the
top as well actually has those vents I
didn't really mention that before the
design of the cooler is very interesting
so it has five heat pipes you can
actually see the heat pipes down here so
those heat pipes actually run across the
GPU core so the GPU cores right here
alright so they run across the GPU core
carrying heat out to a separate heatsink
that blows air directly down on to the
PWM which doesn't have dedicated heat
things on it although it is alone it is
connected or isn't connected I can't
quite tell and I can't get I can't get
in there to see hold on give me a sec so
it looks like it's making contact with
this part of the heatsink but really
this the biggest use of this is to
the pwms all any other components over
here as well as driving heat away from
the GPU with those heat pipes so that's
awesome on the back we find the usual
dual DVI and one mini HDMI that we find
on all GTX 580 s and as usual this is a
pcie 2.0 16 X card so PC a 2.1 or
something like that I think but that
doesn't really make much difference one
way or the other so one thing I want to
do really quickly is I want to find out
if this is a custom PCB and it would
appear that it is not it looks like a
standard PCB so what EVGA has customized
about this card if they have customized
the cooler so they're giving you their
yes sweet looking cooler looks great
actually all right they are customizing
the clock speed so they have turned the
clock speeds up a little bit versus a
standard part and they are obviously
providing their service and their
warranty which you don't get if you
don't buy an EVGA card here's something
funny they look at this there's a few
more components right here versus some
missing ones here
interesting sometimes you see slight
changes over the life cycle of a product
this is actually a very old GTX 580 the
one right here this is a launched 580
from EVGA so this is how the product has
evolved since it or originally was
released so thank you for checking out
this unboxing on the GTX 580 DS from
EVGA don't forget to subscribe to Linus
