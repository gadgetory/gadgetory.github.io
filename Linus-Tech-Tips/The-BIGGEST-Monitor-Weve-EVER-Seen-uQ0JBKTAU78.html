is uh you guessed it getting wider and
in fact twenty percent of the displays
bought by our audience members this year
have been ultra wide but what if I told
you that you could get many of the
benefits of an ultra wide without
abandoning the 16 by 9 aspect ratio that
you've grown to love introducing the
ultra wide and super tall BDM 40:37 you
Ultra HD curved monitor from Philips
hold on to your mind kids because it's
about to get sploded cuz this thing is
40 inches diagonally
sigh bye powers line up of gaming
desktops feature intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out on amazon at the link below so 40
inches is nothing for a TV these days
but when it's sitting right in your face
on a desk it's a different story all
together seriously no one can walk by
this thing without making it comment
about how it's so big something that I'm
totally used to by the way but seriously
the slim bezel the 3000 are curved and
the sheer size of the Philips BDM 4037
you make for an utterly immersive
experience that's unlike anything I've
used before and this is especially true
if you tilt it down towards yourself a
little which may in fact be necessary
since the height can't be adjusted out
of the box though there are some things
I like about the stand it somehow does a
surprisingly solid job of mitigating
screen wobble given the 25 and 1/2 pound
weight of this behemoth and I love the
minimalistic and compact look the stand
has a tendency to loosen causing
unwanted rotation that can drive you
absolutely bonkers I expect a little
more from the stand that's holding up a
thousand-dollar monitor overall I
described the BDM 40 37 you I'm going to
start calling it Phil as streamlined it
has no buttons or i/o at all on the
front or sides and in fact if I wasn't
pretty good at the old reach-around I
probably still wouldn't know how to turn
it on and off at all this is a classic
case of business in the front party in
the back we've got one HDMI 2.0 port and
another HDMI 1.4 both with MHL in case
you wanted to mirror your phone or
tablet display and to DisplayPort 1.2 a
ports moving up back in time we've got a
VGA port followed by audio
in an headphone out good thing too on
that second one because the on-board
speaker sound like a cell phone at the
bottom of a well and then moving right
along we have a generous four type a USB
three five gigabit ports which is not
bad bill in 2017 I'd like to see one of
these trade it in for a type C and
finally another legacy port four
separate sync or sync on green and an
input for the five-foot power cord that
was too short for my setup but I ain't
even mad because there's no external
power brick and all of these cords came
in the box picture quality should
impress most consumers and even earn a
close but no cigar from design
professionals
it's a VA or vertical alignment 10 bit
LCD panel boasting wide 170 degree
viewing angles and a brightness of 300
nits max out of the box that covers
99.98% of the sRGB color space with
Delta e values just under three and a
gamma of 2.29 with an extra credit
loving pat on the behind for covering
over 83% of the Adobe RGB color space
the already good contrast was made for X
ish during our tests by their smart
contrast feature which uses brightness
adjustments to make the contrast ratio a
little wider so with some calibration
this puppy can actually get you a long
way and it's got some cool features too
like picture-in-picture &amp;amp; multi-view
which allows you to use all those
outputs putting up to 4
1080p systems on one screen it's great
for control rooms trade shows or like
those cool stock market desks that you
see in the movies
so at 40 inches phil is as wide as the
ultra wide in my office but with an
extra 4 inches in height
not to mention 40% off the price
this means we give up some gaming
prowess so no 75 Hertz refresh or free
sync and slower pixel response times
but we keep the productivity benefits
and immersiveness of a curved ultra wide
and the tried and true 16 by 9 aspect
ratio and while watching 21 by 9 movies
or playing games on an ultra-wide is
about as close as you can get to a
cinema like experience I suspect a lot
of folks would prefer letterboxing their
movie content to pillarboxing there
everything else content especially given
Phil's excellent black depth and when it
comes to gaming for the titles with
proper horizontal plus support you can
manually set an ultra wide resolution
and then just run native 4k for
everything else and I guess that's the
bottom line
versatility you can watch movies you can
do some photo editing you can use it
like an ultra-wide I mean hell you can
even use it as a small TV I personally
add an arm for height adjust but other
than that Dan I'm really starting to
like this thing tunnel bear Takes the
bear crap out of setting up a VPN it
allows you to browse the internet
privately and enjoy a more open Internet
experience with tunnel bear turned on
your Wi-Fi connection is secured and
your online activity is kept private
from your internet provider advertisers
and I mean basically anyone who's
looking to track you or profit from your
data they've got a top rated privacy
policy and they do not log your activity
so try it for free with five hundred
megabytes of data no obligation no
credit card required and then if you
choose to get an unlimited data plan you
can save 10% by gonna tunnel bear comm
