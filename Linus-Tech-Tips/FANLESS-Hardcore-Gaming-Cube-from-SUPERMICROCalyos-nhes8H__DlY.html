sponsoring this video at CES 2017
freshbooks is the number-one cloud-based
accounting solution for small businesses
so you guys might have seen a video I
did recently where I had this ginormous
passively cooled gaming / workstation
grade box back at the studio here but a
lot of you pointed out that ah that
solution wasn't necessarily that
practical for most people and the fact
that it's so big and so heavy means that
a lot of folks wouldn't be that
interested in it well right here in the
Super Micro Suite they are showing off
something pretty unique so they've got
their new lineup of z2 70 motherboards
including a high-end one with - you - 2
m - 4 PCIe 16 as well as overclocking
features all the way down to a more
basic one but this this is where I had
it in fact this one doesn't even have
one of their desktop boards in it
because they're still working on a mini
ITX consumer one this is project kubu
I'm just going to make up a name for it
because it actually doesn't even have a
name this is so early stages that
they're basically just bringing like
like a custom you know machine shop made
prototype here to get customer feedback
what do you guys think of the color what
do you think of the size what do you
think of the orientation what do you
think of a performance well you can't
tell me anything about that unless I
tell you what exactly it is so inside
this box is a 100% passively cooled core
i5 6500 and GTX 1063 gig gaming box and
when I say passively cooled I mean 100%
passive so you'll see on the top we've
got nothing but a whole lot of mesh
going on on all the sides you've got
pretty much not a whole lot going on
other than mesh and there's a very good
reason for that when we flip it over on
the bottom we get a look at the i/o and
we also get a look at the massive now I
would call them heat sinks but what
these actually are are condensers
because just like that system that I
showed off in the recent video this is
using one of those
passive phase-change cooling systems
from kaleo's so let's get it opened up
so here it is we've got an 1151
motherboard from their embedded line-up
we've got a couple of sodium slot so
that would give us support for up to 32
gigs of memory which is in fact what
they have in here we've got an nvme SSD
running nowhere for a two and a half
inch drive yet but hey let us know if
you can see a spot where that would make
sense I'm sure they would love to find
more room for expansion and yes there it
is right there the heart of one of the
two pooling engines so this is pretty
neat once you take off the black mesh
around the top you can see there are
actually two separate condensers so
think of it kind of like a like a dual
loop liquid cooling system don't pay too
much attention to the i/o or the
placement of the power button because
all of that stuff is very much a
placeholder moving around to the other
side we get a look at the GPU so there
we've got one of those super short GTX
10 63 gigs cooled by yet another one of
those cooling block cooling engine type
things that threw some black magic
allows the fluid to actually circulate
within the loop without any pump or any
other noise what so ever another fun
thing over here is this aluminum foam so
I actually haven't been able to figure
out exactly what that was on the
previous system it is for passive
convection cooling and it's just an
off-the-shelf thing that you can buy
pure aluminum foam go free configure
also over here is a 250 watt 80 plus
Platinum power supply also passive and
back to performance for a minute here or
getting to performance you can expect
CPU temps in the neighborhood of 45 to
50 degree 55 yeah that's what we're at
across all the four cores and on the GPU
we never saw higher than 77 degrees in a
22 degrees Celsius room so well within
reasonable temperatures right now there
is no clear sort of ETA for when
something like this would be available
but as a concept goes this looks pretty
cool and super mikro estimates pricing
would be in the four
t99 range for a configuration like this
so let us know in the comments what you
guys think so thanks guys for watching
