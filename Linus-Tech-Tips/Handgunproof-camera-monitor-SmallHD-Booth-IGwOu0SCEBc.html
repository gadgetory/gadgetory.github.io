description small HD has been making
camera monitors for a while now but they
had always been focused on smaller
camera mounted displays all of that
changes with the introduction of their
brand new small HDR monitors that come
in a 17 inch model a 24 inch model and a
32 inch model respectively each model in
the lineup is constructed of small
entities new aluminum chassis which they
have torture tested relentlessly through
the production of this monitor small HD
seems to be delivering monitors that can
truly survived nearly any harsh
production environment even going as far
as pushing the monitors to the limit by
driving over it with a truck shooting it
with a gun and swinging a baseball bat
at it full speed small HD is updated and
integrated their page UI system into
this lineup of monitors this gives the
user the ability to switch between
multiple displays with different looks
or settings applied to each page in
theory this makes switching between
settings you do not want to talk about
on and off quicker to access there is
also a new window mode that allows for
pages to be displayed simultaneously for
anyone who wants to see multiple
settings applied at once on different
parts of the screen on the back of the
monitor they have integrated a useful
rail system allowing you to mount
accessories like wireless display
modules that there's no need to run any
cables if you do not wish to so what do
you guys think should we try to get one
of these monitors in the office to put
it through its paces ourselves let me
know in the comments down below and for
