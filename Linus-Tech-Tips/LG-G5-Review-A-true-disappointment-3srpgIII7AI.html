smartphone enthusiasts have been asking
for so why is it then that I didn't like
it is it possible that LG didn't pay
enough for a positive review or hear me
out honest is it possible that D brand
provides all of our phones anyway and
that I am capable of forming opinions
all on my own
let's find out
Tunnel bares the simple VPN app that

privately and enjoy a more open Internet

the link in the video description spec
wise it's pretty hard for LG to have
gotten this wrong with media techs still
playing catch-up and Intel having
seemingly bowed out of the smartphone
processor race for now
Qualcomm is pretty much the only choice
at the moment unless your name is Apple
so a snapdragon 820 processor clocked at
2.1 5 gigahertz on the faster cores
paired with an adrenal 530 GPU beats at
its heart in line with Halo SKUs from
other manufacturers the g5 packs 4 gigs
of DDR 4 memory 32 gigs of on-board
storage with microSD expansion and
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on its quad HD
or 2560 by 1440 resolution 5.3 inch
panel it's also got wireless AC and LTE
advanced for wicked connectivity Android
marshmallow and it's available in a
variety of colors including pink with a
3000 ish milliamp hour battery actually
2800 milliamp hours to be precise but in
spite of these similarities there are a
great number of differences between the
g5 and the galaxy s7 from LG's fellow
Korean rival Samsung that need to be
addressed
we'll begin with performance the g5
performs about like you'd expect for and
820 maybe a little better my usual run
Geekbench until it hurts throttling
tests gave it only a 10% gap between its
top score and its bottom scores a very
favorable result next up is the screen
it tickles me to no end the way that
LG's TV division is beating the OLED
drum with Samsung positioning quantum
dot LCD as the top technology of today
citing concerns about maximum brightness
and burnin while Samsung's mobile
division has been pimping OLED for years
at this point and LG is still using LCD
the truth of the matter in spite of the
clear flip-flopping even within the same
freaking company
is that there are just trade-offs to be
made either way the s7 s OLED screen
saves enough power for it to have an
always-on clock feature and gives it
astonishing readability and direct
sunlight at the cost of some color over
saturation while the g5 s IPS LCD screen
boasts more true to the original content
colors great viewing angles without the
weird color shift of some OLED x' at
extreme angles and shockingly and always
on clock with notifications to that
thanks to their displays surprisingly
solid blacks manages to look almost as
good as the s7 s unless you're in a
really dark room where you can see that
all the pixels are backlit and doesn't
even manage to drain the battery life
anymore so full marks for the screen and
a bonus point for the subtle curve at
the top that makes the phone slide onto
your face a little more gracefully and
actually makes it so that pulling down
your notification tray is a little bit
smooth there - this is the first
application of curved phone glass that
feels purely functional to me as opposed
to a mostly just because we can sort of
thing above the screen is a mediocre 8
megapixel F 2.0 selfie camera that
thankfully doesn't share the s7 s makes
my nose look huge fisheye lens but
otherwise doesn't really blow me away
then at the bottom of the screen below
the on screen only no physical buttons
is not one not two but three of the big
features of the g5 first up is the
bottom firing speaker that delivers
marvellous 5.1 surround sound in spite
of its no I'm just kidding the g5
suffers from cup syndrome which is
curious unfortunate placement just like
the top two smartphones right now I'm
talking of course rather about the
reversible more durable quick charge 3.0
equipped USB type-c connector blow-by
micro B don't let the door hit your ass
on the way out to the fact that pressing
this little catch on the bottom causes
that 2800 milliamp hour battery to slide
right out allowing it to be changed
it wears out without a fancy toolkit or
even throughout the day as needed and
three the way that the bottom charging
module here disconnects from the battery
allowing it to be replaced with other
modules so D Brent who as I mentioned
provided our skinned g5 here sent us the
camera one to get a feel for what that's
like and basically it's pretty stupid so
far I had it on for a day before I
realized that it's thick awkward to hold
unless you happen to be taking a picture
and aside from the extra battery
capacity something that I could get with
a sleeker battery case for most phones
contributes absolutely nothing to the
usability of the device it's a glorified
hand grip and a shutter button on a
phone whose camera forced me to stop
using it earlier on in my daily use
review cycle than I normally would I
mean to be clear the camera isn't
unusable or anything and it would be a
huge upgrade if you're still rocking in
Nexus 5 or something but when I'm coming
from the galaxy s7 or an iPhone 6s it is
a significant kick in the balls
there's no gesture to launch something
that everyone not just Motorola and
Samsung needs by the way the low-light
performance everything from dimly lit
without flash to very dark and flash
assisted frankly blows chunks in
comparison look at this shot of my
family in a hotel room compared to the
iPhone 6s and video recording is a solid
net and on top of all that the g5 isn't
waterproof I mean I know it's not
advertised anywhere as being waterproof
but it is amazing how much more likely I
am to use my camera to capture an
awesome moment when it's water-resistant
launches faster and takes better
pictures this trade-off for a removable
battery and being able to install
modules like a clip-on shutter button is
a horrible one for me personally one
that isn't helped by LG's Android skin
this time around I'm not going to hate
on the lack of an app tray believe it or
not I even like some of LG's Flair
double tap to wake is wonderful and
didn't realize how much I missed it
until I had it again and the addition of
a recently uninstalled apps button is
actually kind of cool but to reinstall
them with like one touch but management
of hiding apps something that you need
to do since your home screens are also
your app drawer now could be better I
wish I could just drag them to a hide on
the top of the screen after I long press
or and then uninstall on the other side
rather than digging through a settings
menu for some inexplicable reason
creating folders doesn't intelligently
suggest a name as it does on other
phones available even with the Android
operating system so I'm not sure how
they missed that and it doesn't even let
you start typing right away clustered
notification cards sometimes I'm
actually not sure if I'll be able to
recreate this on camera but they
sometimes like clump up when I try and
expand them making them hard to read and
the rear lock button with fingerprint
sensor while reasonably fast and easy to
reach while holding the phone in my hand
ended up being kind of a pain whenever
the phone was resting on the desk next
to me something that happens quite a bit
since I use a password-protected
lockscreen both Sony and Samsung's
implementations and Apple for that
matter are better here with a
fingerprint sensor on the side or on the
front which I guess leads us pretty
perfectly into the conclusion there's
nothing about the g5 that makes me say
what the hell were they thinking like
oneplus neglecting to include NFC on the
oneplus 2 it's got a feature set that
isn't wrong some folks are going to buy
it
just for the IR emitter and there's no
right answer between swappable battery
versus water resistance it's just not
the mix that I want for myself and that
combined with the only pretty good
camera awkwardly positioned touch sensor
lack of wireless charging and high price
make it hard for me to recommend it in a
world where the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy
S seven exist
speaking of existing you know what
exists D brand they make high quality
vinyl skins for your device which is to
say if your device is one of the devices
that they make skins for they've got
support for our iPhones
Android phones actually wide variety of
Android phones and even computers
including MacBooks and some select pcs
like Dells XPS lineup and the best thing
about D brand is you can use their
configurator to set up your device to
look exactly the way you want whether
you want woodgrain finish like this
laptop here the XPS 15 we reviewed
whether you want a sexy matte black like
you saw on the g5 that I reviewed today
or whether you're completely colorblind
with no sense whatsoever and you want a
you know multicolored iPhone se that
makes people go like yeah when you walk
past them while you're talking on it so
check out D brand comm we've got it
linked in the video description
customize your device the way that you
want and order because they're
affordable and they ship world wide so
