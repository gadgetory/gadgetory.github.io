carbide 500 are from Corsair right away
this is what I would consider to be a
bigger brother to the 400 R which is
also in the carbide family products
remember Corsairs highest sentence there
obsidian line followed by the graphite
line and then by the carbon or a carbide
line at the lowest end in their current
lineup of gaming cases which isn't to
say that even a lowest end Corsair case
is not a good choice because it would be
Corsairs philosophy for the design of
their gaming cases is all about
functionality while maintaining a
certain aesthetic appeal so when we saw
the 800 d come out with a ton of
features that just hadn't been done
before the expectation was that the rest
of a course our case lineup would
include a ton of features that haven't
been done before at the price points
that they're going to be arriving Pat
and you technically can't end a sentence
with the word @ but I did it so here we
are so there are some key differences
already between sorry guys the 500 R and
the 400 are but let's start with the
overall look at the outside of the case
and we'll go from there
so in the front of the case yeah let's
do that we have dual 120 millimeter fan
mounts here and here we've got a nice
mesh finish and then we've got four or
five and a quarter inch base a power
button two USB 3.0 ports a hard drive
led microphone and headphone ports
firewire looks like you're able to turn
the LEDs on and off and a fan speed
controller the fan speed controller is
not included on the 400 are finally a
reset switch the sides of this case are
very clean looking so we've got this
bulge which exists for a reason that's
to give you clearance for the side fans
to blow down on the CPU area as well as
the video card area in this case you can
doodool 120s dual 140s and they all have
rubber grommets for noise dampening at
or you can do a single 200 millimeter
and in this case it's a white LED fan
that is included ok on the other side we
find lots of room for cable routing in
the form of a bulge that comes out of
the side but it's sort of a
sleek-looking bulge it's very
aerodynamic so if the case was like
going really fast like it wouldn't
actually cause that much of a
disturbance in the airflow pattern ok
it's hard for me to get away with sort
of stuff like that but it doesn't
actually it actually looks pretty good
things that are aerodynamic I personally
find them to look better than things
that are not aerodynamic and I think
when you look at car design you find
that to be somewhat somewhat true you
know more you know sleek curvy angular
type cars tend to look better than like
a box on wheels right alright so at the
back we find as I mentioned before lots
of cable routing space although it
doesn't look like it based on that if
there was a flush side panel it would
sit like this far above the motherboard
tray but because of the way they
designed the side panel there'll be
plenty of room to run your EPS for pin
any fan cables you want to run anything
like that so say you wanted to you know
put this under your motherboard and run
it down the back then you would be able
to do that without any difficulty these
are plugged into the fan controller at
this point in time so those are the
front white LED 120 millimeter fans that
are also included and then I think that
pretty much covers it for the back here
there's not a whole lot that I want to
say about that on the other side we open
up the case and we find we are hey check
this out you can't lose your thumb
screws they don't come out I have seen
that feature before but I haven't seen
it in a while so there you go there's
your fan
and there's your panel putting that away
alright so inside here the first thing I
want to try to figure out
because right now I'm not really sure
what's going on here uh-huh
here sorry come up to the front I hope
no ha there we are I was trying to
figure out this whole time how that
comes out
now I know so it clicks in here and you
just kind of push it in from the back
and click it like that and it comes up
so there's your mesh okay which is going
to cover up an area where you can mount
your top mounted 120 millimeter water
cooling unit so Corsairs done very smart
work here with the spacing of their 120
or 140 millimeter mounting holes and
they put them as close together as
possible so that regardless of which
kind of a radiator you have you will be
able to install it without any
difficulty here's where you can route
your fan wires and over here is where
you will mount the tubes that come out
at the top of your rad down to your CPU
socket so I'm going to go ahead and put
this back on so that the case doesn't
just look you know totally skeleton by
the end of the video here and let's have
a look at the inside layout it's very
similar to the 400r except for I'd say
at least one key thing and that is this
so check this up you can actually
completely remove the top set of three
harddrive cages well hard drive or SSD
cages whichever you prefer oh hold on I
believe there are also screws on the
back that are preventing me from
removing it at this time okay so I'm go
ahead and remove those so it's difficult
to remove I'd say but this isn't the
kind of thing that you would have to
remove just for installing a hard drive
you can still install a hard drive just
by using the sliding plastic rails and
that is compatible with both three and a
half inch and two and a half inch drives
but when you're building machine your
machine initially
and you go to install a Radeon 6990 that
you happen to have lying around and you
discover that okay it fits anyway so
that's clearly not what they were
thinking here remember this is the
longest graphics card in existence at
this time at least on the consumer side
of things so if there are longer
graphics cards in the future you can go
ahead and pull this out I mean imagine
what a graphics card that long would
would look like but I mean I'm not here
to judge right so so yeah you would be
able to remove that and I believe the
other one also comes out as well just by
undoing the screws on the back so like I
said this is how you actually install a
drive that is only if you discover
during your build that you you know
maybe you want to have less restriction
on the fan that's blowing over your
graphics card maybe you have a longer
graphics card I don't know what your
reasoning is I don't really care it
doesn't matter because it's your
reasoning not mine you can remove the
cage all right let's go and look at
what's in here here's your there little
hard drive sort of mimicker cardboard
piece here we have something that won't
be relevant until a minute from now when
I explain why it's here so here's power
for the fan controller and whatnot
here's another another header for the
fan controller so you can plug in the
side panel fan alright the back fan
doesn't run off that and I will tell you
why because the expectation from Corsair
is that if you're building an ultimate
machine and you know who Corsair is and
you bought this case you're probably
going to go with an H ad or an H 100 to
cool your cpu so if that's the case
that's going to go ahead and take care
of the control of that back fan for you
you don't need your case to do it so
there you go
alright we've got our front USB 3 and we
also have included an adapter which we
can put on like this if you want to use
front USB 2 instead of front USB 3
because your case doesn't support front
USB 3 or your motherboard doesn't
support it your case does you have front
1394 firewire Front HD audio and front
switches and LEDs and whatnots all kinds
of good stuff
you've got lots of grommets so these are
two filtered either 120 140 millimeter
fan mounts or power supply rubber
grommets to support it and then
ventilation holes to make sure that your
120mm fan on your power supply is
getting lots of air because there are
rubber feet on the bottom of the case
which is going to keep it raised off the
table or carpet or wherever you happen
to put it and make sure your power
supply doesn't starve alright I already
mentioned the rubber grommets here's the
CPU cutout as well as the motherboard
backplate our motherboard tray being
very reinforced it does reinforce it to
put these patterns in it so it's a very
rigid motherboard backplate that's good
especially if you are shipping the
system I haven't forgotten the
accessories but I am getting a prompt
about I think that's it so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 PCI slot which is great because if you
have a bottom PCI Express slot at the
very bottom of your board you can still
install a dual slot graphics card should
you desire to do so last but not least
the rest of the accessories which
includes some zip ties some plastic
clips for mounting cables or for running
cables we got some fair some screws some
more different screws some motherboard
standoffs some other more different
screws and finally the more different 2
screws that we have seen yet so thank
