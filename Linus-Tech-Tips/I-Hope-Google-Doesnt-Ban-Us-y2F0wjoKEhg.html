insane solution to our storage problem
the petabyte project a petabytes of raw
archival storage I mean that thing is
freaking awesome we have yet to have any
problems with it but there's still a
major issue with this deployment it's
not geo redundant at all which means
that if there were a fire in the linus
media group warehouse or i mean really
any kind of natural disaster we could
potentially lose our entire back
catalogue that is anything that we
haven't already uploaded to youtube so
we endeavor to find a way to as
inexpensively as possible
backup the entire server that's all 370
terabytes of currently stored data plus
anything we would want to add in the
future so that's easy enough right
right you know what else is easy your
move over to a better chair like the
ones from noble chairs their icon series
real leather edition gaming chair was
designed in Germany and inspired by
luxury car interiors learn more at the
link below just hope they weren't
inspired by like the trunk of a luxury
car because that would be very
uncomfortable
now there are a lot of different ways
that we could go about backing up our
server some of them easier and some of
them harder than others but almost all
of them are gonna be limited by one
thing our internet bandwidth I mean
don't get me wrong we have a symmetric
gigabit connection I'm not complaining
but when you're talking about hundreds
of terabytes that are already in the
archive and then up to a couple of
terabytes a day being added things can
start to take a while like like months a
while now our first idea was to build
something locally fill it up with data
here using our 10 gigabit network and
then ship it off-site a sort of like ah
thank you Jake oh wow
petabyte project part 2 now this
solution wouldn't actually expand our
storage capacity because it would just
be an identical server or that is to say
two servers with the same data on it but
since our internet service provider
offers us inexpensive colocation it
would actually be very cost effective
from an ongoing standpoint except for
one small problem if we had to buy two
more decked-out
sixty drives store inators we'd be
looking at with the drives included
upwards of seventy thousand US dollars
so converted to Canadian rubles that is
getting dangerously close to six-figure
territory you can you can take that away
so so that eliminates hard drives you
good ok just remember lift with your
back with a twisting jerking motion yeah
so that eliminates hard drives
what about tape storage a rackmount tape
library like this one from HP enterprise
only costs about five to seven thousand
dollars and high-capacity 12 terabyte
LTO eight tapes are about a hundred and
sixty bucks apiece so for over 500
terabytes of uncompressed backup
capacity that's actually looking pretty
good by comparison but there's the fact
that we'd need two of them
and it looks like we're still spending
well over 20,000 US dollars up front
lump sum throw that on the black card
you know how it is
so hardware based solutions are not
looking too peachy what up what about
shoot what's it called it's kind of like
buzzword II just disruptive no walk
chain no cloud cloud storage you guys
were all shrieking at us back when we
originally built petabyte project for
not using cloud storage for our archive
in the first place so I think this is
where you come in we're gonna check out
some AWS here there buddy
this is glacier so this is like slow
start the demo okay so if we just wanted
to pack up everything we got right now
many years terabytes $1,500 a month Wow
plus support you know you need support
1667 so if we wanted to store the full
what is it about 760 terabytes that we
have like that that we could have oh
wait
$3,400 a month I mean I get it I guess
these guys have to cover the upfront
costs that they're paying for that same
hardware and they've got you know geo
replication and all that kind of cool
stuff as well but like holy balls wait
hold on a second go go back to that no
no no this is before you even actually
pull any date out of it okay you have to
pay to pull data out both go the
cheapest one yeah we want to pull the
whole thing another two grand so so this
is great so let's say you're your office
burns down and you've got to pull all
your data out of the cloud you get a
nice handy dandy build for $2000 to add
insult to injury that's that's the
slowest that's the slowest speed so
let's say let's say you need it all of
it right away
real fast oh oh
Oh 12 grand no big deal whatever it's
fine don't worry about it casual right
casual and the crazy part of this is
that other enterprise solutions from the
likes of Google Microsoft and Backblaze
aren't priced that differently so what
are we gonna do I'm not paying did three
to five grand a month to start data on
tape wait does this goes to heaven
limited storage well yeah but there's no
way that's actually unlimited well I
mean it's gotta be that would be false
advertising wouldn't the $10 per user
tier unlimited cloud storage or one
terabyte per user if fewer than five
users so we just give five users that's
like $50 a month that's nothing it can't
be unlimited I guess we gotta try to
find out if this loophole is actually
gonna work
we fired up a Windows 10 VM on our
utility on raid server and install the
tool called
our clone so Jake's got the unlimited
Google Drive account set up and working
so it should just be a matter of running
the command and seeing what happens so
maybe start with channel super fun super
how BIG's that oh that might take a
while but remember guys this is over a
hundred drives spread across and two
completely separate boxes that are
networked to each other wow this is
taking forever I think we had index the
entire petabyte project and I think we
had almost a million files on it it took
like literally I think a couple hours to
do but I did index a little thing
windirstat doesn't work it dies it like
just can't handle that much okay so
should we see how it's going here
oh it's it's not going at all what the
heck what oh there's a limit so you were
right yeah it is limited it's limited
but it's limited in a way that the
advertising is not false so it's
unlimited data yeah as long as it's 750
gigs per day
as it turns out Google saw bastards like
us coming a mile away and it looks like
if you don't want to have your upload
cut off you're only able to do 750 gigs
a day otherwise you have to wait an
additional 24 hours for an upload band
to pass so what we would have to do then
is slow our uploads to just around 8
megabytes a second which would mean that
our current 370 terabytes would you got
that calculator handy 307 terabytes so
who would take about two years so while
Google hasn't limited our uploads they
have effectively made it completely
impractical for us to abuse their system
this way guess that makes sense
oh wait nope we're not defeated yet new
plan so you're actually required to pay
for a minimum of five D suite accounts
in order to unlock that unlimited
storage tier but that got us thinking
and actually I'm gonna give Jake full
credit for this idea what if we used
that limitation to our advantage check
this out so it turns out that the 750
gig per day upload cap is per each one
of our users here so by just adding a
couple more accounts user six here and
mr. Jake tiny we can actually end up
even if we limit each account to not go
over 750 kids a day we can still end up
maxing out our upload speed to drive at
about 40 to 45 megabytes a sec
now it's not the prettiest solution but
this has been going for a week and each
one of our instances here has now done
about four terabytes of data yeah it's a
lot of data a lot of data so conclusion
time then I guess I mean for now there's
there's no guarantee whatsoever that
Google isn't gonna shut down this
workaround and there's a fair number of
Googlers out there I think that watch
our videos so us making this video sort
of increases our chances but for now at
zero upfront cost and seventy dollars a
month for our 7g suite accounts that's
less than a thousand dollars a year we
have got what is quite literally the
least expensive multi terabyte backup
solution that you could have we're
basically terrible people I'm okay with
it though I can live with myself on the
plus side though this supports
encryption on upload and download it
does and there are no fees for pulling
the data down in the event of some kind
of a disaster I mean who knows how fast
it's gonna be that helps me sleep better
at night so there you go we're pretty
happy even if anyone watching at Google
isn't hi are you - Bret I'm sorry to
tell people your name ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction when
you call ting you don't speak to a robot
you get put through directly to a person
who can help you and you don't pay extra
for the privilege the average team bill
is just 23 bucks a month per device and
they've got cheaper data rates then ever
it's now just $10 a gig beyond the first
gig so go try out their savings
calculator over at Linus 2018 ting comm
if it turns out you'll save on ting
they'll actually cover 25% of your
cancellation fee for your existing
contract up to $75 and using our link
that's Linus 2018 ting comm you can get
25 bucks in service credit or towards a
new device go check it out at the link
in the video description so thanks for
watching guys if you were
for Google well you know what to do but
if the video was awesome getting
subscribe hit that like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
we featured in the video description
also linked in the description is if
you're a Google shareholder you're
probably not stoked on this either also
linked in the description is our merch
George has cool shirts like neither of
the ones I'm wearing give an LT t-shirt
like this one cool shirts like this one
