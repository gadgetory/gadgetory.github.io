our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys in an Tek sweet they've got some
cases and some case fans and power
supplies and my voice is totally totally
gone by now we're pretty far into the
show I've done a lot of talking so we're
going to start with the fans so they've
actually updated their fan line this is
the true quiet pro right here this one
I've looked at before it's extremely
quiet truly and it's really nothing new
this is the true quiet LED
120-millimeter so this guy right here as
for LEDs looks kind of cool it's not
quite as sophisticated as the true quiet
pro so you can see it doesn't have that
moving outer frame so you don't have
those larger blades but it is sort of a
less expensive option and as far as LED
fans go it's kind of hard to find
high-quality ones and this would fill in
that gap this guy right here don't worry
they don't sound like that I got
something cottenham plates this one
right here is the true quiet UFO so it
comes in a variety of colors and what's
cool about them is that it's actually
not a colored piece of plastic they are
all clear plastic but once you actually
power them up they have colored LEDs
that make them glow the way that they do
they have these extremely gorgeous
silicon isolating mounts here in the
corner you can see how soft and supple
and delicious those are no kind of you
know okay this has gotten awkward we're
going to move along next let's move over
to power supplies here I'll say nothing
so you don't have to hold that there so
one of the show pieces here is the high
current pro 1300 platinum now they've
got sort of a bunch of their other stuff
high current pro 1000 platinum which
we've looked up just outstanding they're
high current gamer series high current
platinum series but this guy if you know
anything about power supplies if you've
ever read a review on Johnny guru you'll
know how impressive it is when I show
you guys a how clean the internals are
you know you can't see any sort of mess
no wires I mean we're all the wires
inside this thing right now check
this out fully modular power supply Oh
see link which actually allows you to
link up two of these things for a total
of 2.6 kilowatts of power just for the
lulz right in case you needed that flip
this over here flip this over here don't
hold on it's not the impressive part yet
Pam check that out when have you ever
seen traces that clean on the bottom of
a power supply so antex whole thing
about this guy is this is
state-of-the-art manufacturing has all
the features that you could possibly
want because of the 80 plus platinum
certification that means it's basically
up to ninety five percent efficiency in
places where they use 230 volt power and
just yeah awesome manufacturing on that
one so let's move on to this guy p280
white with a twist windowed twist to be
specific so I've got a couple looks like
they put the demo back together wrong
there's two mismatched thumbscrews
you're going to end up with these ones
with the plastic coating on the outside
not the other kind that I have here so
what they've done with the black one is
they are the with the light one rather
is they've added a window they have kept
the noise isolating material the 270
degree opening door and they've left
black on the case as an accent so you
still have the removable fan filter not
a whole lot has changed from the p280
just the color scheme has kind of that
storm trooper look that people seem to
really really like and the side panel
holy crap we finally have an antec p
something ate something serious case
with a side window I've been asking for
this for years years I've been asking
for this and they finally done it and to
keep in line with their philosophy of
quiet computing on the p2p x8x series of
cases they've gone with instead of just
a regular window they've gone with the
clean look no rivets no no holes drilled
so they're using a 3m adhesive to adhere
the window to the side panel and they're
actually this is all acrylic so it goes
the entire the entire length and width
of the panel so what that means is it
adds some rigidity it adds an additional
layer for sound dampening and it just
adds some sort of overall heft to the
case that it otherwise wouldn't have
other than that we've got a bone stock
p28 e looks really sharp with the white
and black color scheme but it is time to
move on to the next thing so this one
we're going to play a little game the
game is called guess how much this costs
so in terms of features this case over
here is I'm going to move over this way
this case right here is the GX 700 so in
terms of the actual features it's very
similar to the M 1100 here which is a
military green styled 1100 basically
where they've changed the top fans to
duel 120 so that it can accommodate a
radiator so this guy right here has a
bunch of really cool stuff c'mon part
you got front USB 3 front USB to you got
fan control with three positions
built-in under lekha sort of added a
missile release sort of system here it
accommodates a top 240 millimeter
radiator these are kind of neat check
this out so it's actually got little
clips in the front that are not just for
looks these will actually lock your
optical bay into place just by sliding
it in here's something cool as well so
guys remember we're playing the poop I
guess how much it costs game and I want
you to post what you think before I
actually finish solid pieces of metal so
the front panel is actually metal not
only on the five and a quarter inch base
but also this piece right here that
attaches with four from four thumbscrews
where you can access the fan filter even
this badge right here is metal and you
can easily pop it off and replace it
with something else if you want let's go
ahead and open this case up so other
than that it looks sort of pretty pretty
standard I guess seven expansion slots
rear 120 millimeter fan sorry let me get
out your way diesel have a look at that
go ahead pop this side panel off so you
got a rear fan mount it actually comes
with three fans so to 140 s in the top
and one 120 in the back inside you find
the big CPU cut out you've got sort of
the typical antec toolless sliders for
your drives so there's five of those
included they mount either a three and a
half or two and a half inch drive ATX
compatibility sort of yeah but what
about what you'd expect for a gaming
case so you know very messy very cooling
the price for this thing is 59fifty
think about that for a minute hold on
let the process the price is 59fifty so
antec is going after people who want
a feature-rich case and are willing to
compromise on things like how heavy it
is and how much it costs antec has on
displaying their sweet not just cases
power supplies and all the stuff that we
know them for but also the antec mobile
products lineup so we're going to start
with the pulse this is something that's
quite new it comes in a wide variety of
different colors in fact what we have
here in front of me isn't anywhere near
how many are available it comes in at
149 this is a Bluetooth 3.0 headset
these are they are using leather for the
top headband and one thing I'd like to
know is that in spite of the plastic
design and construction up here they've
actually added more padding on the top
headband then I'm typically used to
seeing and that coupled with the fact
that it is extremely light makes it
comfortable even though i was actually i
had to wait for my meeting for a little
while so i just put them on just for the
lulz to see to see how long to see how
long it would take before they'd get
uncomfortable and i didn't actually have
any issues with them whereas i often
even on my parrot Zeke's I find them to
be uncomfortable after about 15 minutes
or so on the side you've got volume
control as well as your pairing button
and you've got sorry what was the size
of the drivers in this one now they're
working on okay so you've got a pass
through using 3.5 mil as well as a
charging cable here so this is neat
because when you're on an airline and
you can't use wireless you can use it
with a 3.5 mil Jack and this will give
you about six hours of battery life so
there's your button for taking calls and
this is pretty much what it looks like
once you put it on I think this is my
color you know I'm an autumn or you know
whatever the terminology is for that
moving right along we've got the SP 1
i've talked about this before basically
it's kind of like a jam box but more
better in sort of yeah every possible
way much better sound quality this right
here has no name and doesn't exist for
all you guys know here is the the
pairing button on the back power in as
well as a 3.5 millimeter input and this
thing is just ridiculous i love it
they've put much larger much higher
quality drivers and is more of a proof
of concept that the factory can produce
this than anything else and before we
leave here I'm totally going to ask to
leave with it but I'm probably going to
get shot down so love to have something
like that this is great for traveling
with whereas this is the
thing that you could actually
legitimately put in your living room and
use as just a random sort of Bluetooth
speaker moving over here we've talked
about the ISO we've talked about the DBS
now let's take this from you this is the
game so this is kind of like the ISO
except that you're not tied to the
headphones that it comes with so this
allows you to take any headphone or
headset and use it as a bluetooth
headphone or headset very cool stuff so
you got tracks get volume up and down as
well as the ability to take calls and
hang up calls it lasts for about six
hours on battery and it comes with free
earbuds although the thing that I'm more
interested in inside this box is
definitely this guy because it gives you
the flexibility to use the equipment
that you're more comfortable with versus
having to deal with some kind of a
built-in solution so you have the
earbuds you know you like you know you
prefer them then go ahead and stick with
this next I'd like to move over into the
enttec mobile products charging products
so these are we've seen these before
everyone's seen these before but these
ones are a little bit unique I mean
antex background is power supplies so
these have all of the industrial
protections that they're typically
accustomed to including with a computer
power supply you've got over voltage
protection overheat protection over
current protection and unlike again so
it comes down to that true power message
that they keep throwing at the power
supplies it comes down to actually
delivering the face you know the
amperage that they claim as well as the
capacity that they claim with these
things so this guy right here is able to
charge up to four devices simultaneously
and has two amps of output so that means
that you can actually charge your
devices much faster diesel in particular
has a galaxy note 2 and he's found that
the charging rates with one amp devices
are absolutely anemic compared to what
he's able to achieve with a 2 amp device
so this guy right here is only two ports
but is also capable of two amps this guy
right here is just a car charger so you
know you've got all those protections
that are included with it I mean another
thing that antec brought up to us is
they have a much more intelligent sort
of design than we've seen what sort of
though the cheapo OEM ones for example
it'll automatically turn off if you have
a cable plugged in but nothing
we plugged into the other end not all of
them do that it'll stop charging your
device once it detects that it's
actually full so that puts less strain
on your battery and it reduces the risk
of any kind of an electrical problem
because if a device is off and it's not
going to cause a problem so this is the
power up 3000 so this is going to charge
your iPhone twice and this is the power
up six thousand which is going to charge
your iPhone 4 times you can see for size
actually I should probably be doing an
iphone comparison if I'm going to bring
up an iphone while I talk about
something that's a mobile product and
iPhone related so it's about that thing
I think that pretty much wraps it up
