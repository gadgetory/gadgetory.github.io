unboxing of the FS PRM series gold 400
power supply so personally I'm a big fan
of highly efficient reasonable wattage
power supplies and the reason for that
is actually outlined in a recent
addition of NCIX tech tips that I did
and you you should check that out it's
called power supply power consumption
system power consumption or something
like that and what we basically do is we
take a system we upgrade it from a very
very basic configuration all the way
through all the steps up to a very
high-end machine and then we discover as
we go along how much power it consumes
so what we found out was we plugged in a
1200 watt 80 plus gold power supply and
power consumption sucked the efficiency
was no good because we were consuming so
little power from it whereas if we'd
taken a 400 watt 80 plus gold power
supply we would have actually consumed
less power as a whole so it's got kind
of a neat finish on it it's got a
five-year warranty it's recommended for
gaming and workstation remember you can
power a decent gaming machine off a 400
watt power supply here's the overall
specs which we'll see as we open up the
unit itself FSP Mya I see multiple
intelligence ability chipset okay and
what else have we got here constant hold
up control performs continuous
adjustments according to the output load
in order to achieve the best possible
efficiency so this is all about
efficiency as I mentioned before it is
80 plus gold let's just go ahead and
start opening up the unit itself so the
first thing we find inside is a Quick
Start Guide which pretty much tells you
not a whole lot English is the fourth
language in here if I can even find it
shows you the connectors and whatnot
we've also got four black thumb screws
nice little touch an FSB case badge as
well as three velcro cable ties power
cable is included and then the power
supply itself wrapped in my favorite
kind of foam so the closed cell foam
that is really very very durable
and you can see right here this is a 400
watt power supply so it doesn't have a
whole lot of cables attached but let's
look at the unit itself first so it's
got a gold ish blackish
dark ish this is a really neat powder
coat finish this is actually very
similar to the finish that I have on my
TJ o7 case my personal case I had it
done by mountain mods it's they call it
black wrinkled it's very durable
completely fingerprint proof almost
scratch proof and looks outstanding it's
like I'm not black but it has a little
bit of shine to it almost like it has
brushstrokes in it like it was painted
because plastic in there we've got a 120
millimeter cooling fan covered by a
grill that's covered by a little piece
of plastic here that'll protect that go
ahead remove that there you go now you
can see the full shininess at the back
we have kind of an arrow design to the
Batgirl that looks like it should
provide pretty unrestricted airflow
through the back of the power supply a
power input power switch on both sides
of the unit we find what's that that
comes off okay we find FSP branding as
well as that nice black wrinkle finish
on the top we find the overall specs of
the unit so let's have a look here you
can see it does have dual 12-volt rails
that are together capable providing up
to 384 watts of power so that is almost
the full 400 watt capacity of this power
supply and then we move around to the
other side of the unit where we find
more FSP branding you can see what
they've done is if your windows on the
normal side of your case no matter oh
okay we'll be upside down if you go this
way so the FSP will be right side up if
you install it this way around we've got
a few more of those ventilation arrows
here on the front of the unit and now
let's have a look at this leaving as
well as the cables that come pre
attached to the autumn 400 watt so here
we are we have our 20+4 pin power
connector you can see that uses a pretty
decent quality sleeping on it so you
can't really see the color of the wires
too much through that okay next we have
our four plus four pin EPS power
connector so this is quite a long cable
which is good because if you have a
bottom mounted power supply you're going
to want to be able to reach the top left
corner of the motherboard where that's
usually situated here we have a
six plus two so eight pin PCIe power
adapter I would have liked to see an
additional one of these but you can
always use adapters so we do have three
molex connectors and one floppy
connector so you could use a couple of
those to get another PCIe six pin out of
it remember this will power a decent
machine right guys so even with like a
gtx 560 you'll have no problem using a
400 watt power supply and then finally
for SATA power connectors so all of
those are sleeved and then terminated
individually so it looks quite nice so
let's just see if there's anything else
we missed here before we wrap it up
acoustic noise they're claiming it's
whoops they're claiming it's quite quiet
even up to a hundred percent load most
power supplies you see on there noise
charts they usually kind of ramp up like
this near 100 percent load this one does
not and in terms of efficiency because
it is 80 plus gold it is peaking up at
around 90% efficiency so thank you for
