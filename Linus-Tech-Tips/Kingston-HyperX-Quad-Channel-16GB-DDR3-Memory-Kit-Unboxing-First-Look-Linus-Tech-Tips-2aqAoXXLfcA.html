it goes with something that's also very
exciting okay so right here this is my
beautiful retail box yeah whatever
Intel socket LGA 2011 CPU that's that's
a huge CPU I mean here's the iPhone
comparison look at that thing yeah
that's right
this thing has just the sheer logic
calculating part of it is like you know
third the size of an iPhone so there you
go that is what will be powering your
new CPU or your new computer if you are
buying a new computer that is on the
very high-end range it's a six core CPU
and this is the RAM that goes with it
because that CPU that large CPU features
a quad channel memory interface so
Kingston was kind enough to send me a 16
gigabyte that is 4 by 4 gig ddr3 1600
megahertz cl9
quad channel HyperX memory kit so these
are all Bend to run together in perfect
harmony on intel's new platform so this
is HyperX genesis got a very beautiful
heat spreader on it let's just go ahead
and flip that over and what I'm very
very excited about is the fact that not
only will intel's new platform support
quad channel memory it'll support get
this 8 dims on a desktop platform so
you'll be able to take two 16 gig kits
like this and run them together for 32
gigs of ram on a desktop platform with
inexpensive 4 gig dims I know a crazy um
so anyway I think that's pretty much it
I think this is actually the first time
I've looked at HyperX Genesis memory so
I'd like my cameraman to just come in
here and have a close look at that and
you could do something like pan shots
yeah there you go
so we've got our little kingston guy
here you got our hyper X logo is it
shining is it shining for the camera oh
good yes that's good so then on the
other side we've got some more shining
got Rex again very nice stuff so big
thanks to Kingston for making my sandy
bridge-e
same platform possible and I'm looking
forward to bringing you guys the results
of my testing on that platform very very
exciting stuff going on right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
