way I click the button we're live we're
live and you did it yeah welcome to the
wine show come on welcome in guys
I'm Manning the I'm Manning the computer
today I've never done it before I'm very
excited yeah I uh
we've got Ruby soft is killing game Keys
it's it's an interesting title for that
subject we'll talk about that soon
Facebook the future is private and what
everyone believes that a half a cent
that's that's solid yeah you wanna do
the next shot and well we have two more
and blue the Intel Z GPU it supports ray
tracing sort of sort of one of them does
well to it I mean yeah I guess it
definitely does but only one of them
yeah also we're not sure how we feel
about this one but I guess we'll talk
about it later Epic Games by SIA
psionics I almost see owner epic bionics
which is the rocket League developers
yeah they're just out here trying to
screw up the ecosystem you know I don't
know how I don't know what I think about
this I'm very confused anyways you can
get your thoughts out after the intro
boom look I did it yay
that's you know that's you that's me yep
very excited you know what's that thing
on my shirt is supposed to be
way to go ahead hey the first sponsor is
private Internet access BPA that they
get your internet going real good
and savage jerky your stomach going real
good you never want to taste something
good check them out and fresh books the
freshest books you've ever seen in your
life getting your books going real good
yes sir
a hekia and here we are we made it on
the land show this technical you ant
show why I was explaining that I am like
half dead right now but I'm technically
here which is good you look thank you
you're doing great I feel like I'm dying
I believe in you but persevere
floatplane launched its new transcoding
and uploading thing this week which
means pretty much nothing for all of you
but it means a lot for creators and it
means a lot for being on the bring more
creators on the platform also maybe talk
about that a little bit later on but now
do be soft killing game keys yes yeah so
I guess there's a the reasoning for this
is that I mean what's the problem with
game keys so click on my loop screen
thing Luke screen boom you got oh that's
how we that's how you do the show okay
so gubisov is trying to prevent illegal
resales of its games with a new method
of selling digital PC game keys called
silent key activation or ska it's not to
be confused with the music music yeah
which is not a legal game for news sales
yeah I haven't personally heard of this
method but apparently you go to an
external website you pick a game key you
pay them you sign it with you you play
account and you have the game yeah which
which is a little bit funky there's been
external game stores for a long time
where you can get a key and just in the
when you're done checking out you either
get email the key or it just shows up
right there and you just copy paste it
there
this is a new thing and I guess there's
been sort of legal issues with that
where you know some resellers can manage
to get their hands on game keys through
perhaps illicit means yeah and so this
is a way to prevent that and kind of
make it make sure everything is kosher
and you know by the book yeah so instead
of like getting an actual key and
getting that through a website you go to
a site and then you have to sign into
your account and then so it likes does
authentication through the website
instead of just throwing keys all over
the place right because I know I know
when the throwing Keys all over the
place thing sort of started pretty early
on people were buying keys in countries
where the games were more heavily
discounted due to the average income of
that country hmm and then they were
selling them to countries where your
income was much higher right so there
was countries that would like get a
discount cuz like you know what kind of
hard to afford these things in certain
areas so we'll let it be cheaper for you
and then people buy tons of keys there
and resell them it's a little shady yeah
there's been a lot of a lot of shadiness
around that department so this method is
supposed to make it harder for illegal
game keyword redistribute errs to
operate and the problem that I saw with
it than when I was reading about it was
that this now requires you to sign in to
whatever site that you are getting the
key from with your like Ubisoft account
so then they have probably a like
external authentic I don't remember the
exact name for it right now because I'm
blasted but it's probably not on alcohol
on lack of sleep but it's it's probably
a like external sign-on thing it's
probably okay right it's good probably
okay probably cuz I don't know anything
about the development side so all I can
do is say that sounds gonna crazy it's
like how you can use like steam to sign
into the line effectives form which I
don't do right but you could I don't
either - yeah I have my own account
but you would still have your own
account you're just using it for
authentication yeah but I don't want
somebody to be able to buy games on my
Steam account through the line is tech
tips for him which I know you would do
if you had the chance
okay so I think so what you're saying is
my voice keeps cracking I know I don't I
don't know if it's actually an issue but
so but what you're saying I think I'm
gonna try to interpret for a second
interpreter
yeah is that you're worried that you
login and authenticate and then anyone
could go on that website anytime and buy
groups in the future and let me clarify
that that's not necessarily my concern
but that is what I read no that's evil
we're having an issue with that seems
valid if you don't have to login or you
don't have to authenticate every time
right because as has been proven time
and time and time and time again
websites will be vulnerable and things
will be stored in terrible plaintext
very commonly all over the place mmm oh
yes yeah once a month does that a lot
yeah with all of their different
services yeah yeah that's great 10
digital game distributors are doing it
right now including fanatical and
GamersGate not gamergate GamersGate what
gamersgate is up is a I've never heard
of it but it's barely the game that's
amazing
while Green Man gaming have their own
equivalent tech in place like that's
what that says I don't know exactly what
that means
okay they probably had a similar set up
already done but yeah I mean I guess I'm
ok with it
I forgot the thing was on my screen is
on your screen so yeah sorry go back to
main I'll go back to main basically have
to be at the beginning of Nerdist have
the power I have the mouse the beginning
of an article we jump to one of those
screens really quick just so people can
see the article oh you guys don't want
to see they don't want to see important
information first you know part of it I
do I'm not I'm a tech lend guy okay I'm
not the way and show guy you I respect
your work flow here ok that's they over
here I don't know if I really call it a
work flow it's just like something we
fell on top of after doing it for a
while there's any flow or plan actually
gotcha but yeah it's interesting
I'm not against it I've always thought
those websites were pretty kind of
sketch yeah I mean I thought some some
games keys from resellers but every time
I do it I'm kind of like feel a little
bad
you know I doing something bad it's like
this is discounted a ridiculous amount
there's got to be a reason for it but
also it's cheap it's also discounted
ridiculous amount so here we go yeah so
if there's a way for me to like be
assured that this is like more legit I
think that's a good thing
yeah because like the big thing is like
making sure that you know the morally
ambiguous sort of situation is kind of
streamlined less morally yes okay well
should we move on I mean I don't know I
don't really have any other thoughts
about that do you guys have thoughts I
can yeah that I'm not used to be half to
being able to look at the chat I can't
do it I can't multitask
I mean tasks yeah I can't at all yeah so
one random thing I'm going to say for
floatplane viewers were we're testing a
new CloudFlare thing today and it sounds
like it maybe isn't working that great
so if it's super bad I'm sorry the test
isn't working out maybe temporarily jump
over elsewhere next up though we're
gonna do Facebook we're gonna do it
we're gonna do Facebook so Facebook had
their f8 Developer Conference I'm sorry
geez sorry guys so the f8 developer
conference this was kind of one of the
big first times that Mark Zuckerberg was
oh yeah we're going to Luke's screen oh
the future is private so Mark Zuckerberg
wrote a blog post a couple of weeks ago
or a month ago or something like that
talking about like alright guys you know
what Facebook has had a lot of these
privacy gaffes up to now but you know
what now we're committed to privacy you
know more eels we're doing it this time
the future is private and I mean there
hasn't really been
a horrible major privacy gaffe since he
did that it's more like it's more like
some news still kind of trickles out
every once in a while that's like oh
yeah back in 2016 they were doing this
when they said they weren't yeah storing
people's passwords in that plain text
file
well wait didn't that happen like
literally weeks ago with the Instagram I
don't remember because I deal with this
news all the time but yeah I don't
remember whether that was like oh we
were just storing them like last year go
back to the main thing go back to the
main thing so yeah you should have just
done this we thought this would be a fun
idea for me to control it this time but
no so like yeah we're gonna look at
April 22nd news article yeah yeah yeah I
think that might have been about them
storing them previously yeah that makes
sense
let's see stored past tense well yeah I
don't think they would say that when
it's still currently that's true that's
true you can't really trust them saying
that we're not doing it now that's
that's a fair point they don't seem to
specify a long or a time look I'm I'm as
anti-facebook as the next guy okay yeah
I'm not trying to use it all anymore I I
have not used Facebook for years I mean
other than to like but like for specific
functions yeah but you have an H a
messenger somebody yeah I have an
account yeah yeah so like yeah I think
the biggest problem what did you not
have me I know I tried I think I've
deleted my account three times really
keeps cracking every time I delete it I
come back and it's never because like I
want to you and I always be grudgingly
come back and it's usually because like
I need to contact someone yeah and the
Yellow Pages isn't really a thing
anymore but you're not going on there
and like posting a status I don't post I
don't do that post I don't post
I used the I use messenger and I use a
couple of the groups right I see I was I
think I I wasn't a group and then we
kind of like I kind of like stopped
going to the like I didn't really have a
reason to
in the Facebook group anymore and so I'm
out of that group and that was like my
last vestige into it and so now I'm like
I don't even got it set up so that I
have an extension on I believe it's
Chrome and Firefox where if I go to
Facebook it deletes the entire feed and
just puts like a random quote there so
that there is no feed in the middle and
there's just your messenger in your
groups that's it oh yeah it's it's great
well actually that segues really well
into what we're talking about here so
the app TFA developer conference one of
the things that they focused on was they
said we're redesigning Facebook around
groups events and like kind of features
meant to help people meet up in real
life so there's like a meet people
function because they were doing some
dating thing as well yeah there's dating
so it would just like go through the
notes and see if there's something here
yeah so at Facebook's f8 conference Mark
Zuckerberg pledged to transform the
companies approach to privacy while
revealing major changes to Instagram and
whatsapp he acknowledged that the social
media behemoths had much work to do to
rebuild trust with the global community
I know we don't exactly have the
strongest reputation very true so
they're gonna roll out a redesign site
that's simpler faster more immersive and
puts communities at the center like I
said so app users will notice immediate
changes with a new desktop site is
expected in the next few months and
they're gonna make it easier to switch
between public spaces and private groups
where users can engage with groups of
people who share your interests so yeah
I totally track with that because I
don't go on there for like social media
use yeah no I don't go on there to like
see what are my friends posting I go on
there if I like have a specific function
- so do you think this is them accepting
that their audience is older yeah maybe
yeah I actually saw an interesting take
on it which was that because they're
focusing more around groups and events
it might like make the whole kind of we
call it bubble like the okay yeah yeah
yeah he called that
look at my brain I think a couple works
I think there's like another word that
people normally put with it I don't
remember but bubble yeah but like yeah
like a bubble so only interact with the
people that you want to interact with
yeah you know yeah which is fine I guess
but like yeah it's an interesting take
on it so then you were saying the dating
thing yeah there's also a dating thing I
think it's called secret crush and one
of the ways that it works is why is the
way that it works is you select a
certain amount of people that you want
to be your secret crush and then they
get a notification saying that someone
ooh
the added them is the secret crush but
they don't know who yeah and then if
they happen to add you back out of
nowhere then then it tells each other
yeah it's like tinder yeah if you like
there's no like swiping it's just your
friends on Facebook right but that I
mean I feel like it's even more
interesting because it's like someone
you already know and you're like I
wouldn't mind like dating that person so
we all know like one dude who's just
gonna secret crush every single one of
them secret crushes him back like yes I
did it I mean I think I'm married but if
I have an interest income if I was
single this would be like pretty
interesting I'd be like oh I didn't know
Ashley likes me but you wouldn't unless
you flagged everyone on your list well
if I yeah I'd have to flag them Ashley
yeah yeah and ok one more one more
interesting thing from the Facebook
thing The Hiding likes so Instagram
they're doing this in Canada actually
yeah actually Canada is an extremely
common testbed for mobile stuff oh yeah
because we're extremely similar to
Americans right and if it is annoying
then we're like it's okay yeah I
appreciate it
so I actually saw some people posted
about this as well like they they some
people are already experiencing it yeah
it's being rolled out yeah so like if
you are a regular you
you can't see you won't be able to see
the number of likes that someone else's
post has but you will be able to see how
many likes your post has but you have to
click through to see it so like just on
the regular people it'll just be like
liked by this person and others and you
won't see how many people had liked it
so is this like a why like is this a
mental health move yeah I think so okay
I think that and I think it's a good
move to be honest because I think that I
think it might be bad for business
reasons they might be good for like yeah
the mental health of the world reasons
well do as a business do you need the
public to see how many likes you got on
one of you're like well no it's oh I
don't necessarily think so
what oh yeah no cuz you could still tell
the business who's hiring you to wear
their bathing suit that you got X amount
of views yeah
so yeah I have access to like analytics
for you but I think it would be harder
for those businesses that want to
advertise that way to shop around yeah
you'd have to like if you wanted to do
business for with with an influencer
you'd have to like ask them for their
analytics yeah ahead of time and just
like well hope that they're decently
sized well I it doesn't say anything
about followers so they'll be able to
see like how many okay so they just want
to know like how active yeah and I think
it fit for older accounts from a mental
health perspective I feel like it's good
for people to post things to social
media and then not like have to worry
about getting notified if some likes I
don't know I don't know because I feel
like that's gonna have quite a draw to I
didn't see anything about that oh man
okay should we should we prioritize this
one or this one I think we got it we got
to do the title yeah you're right yeah
all right
until zgp you to support ray-tracing
yes so at FMX
is that a I'll go to your thing Luc's
see I'm hurting on top of it yeah so um
Intel announced at you know what FM X's
I've never heard of that before
I don't nobody stands for but I've heard
of it yeah so Intel announced that their
Z GPU architecture will support hardware
acceleration of ray-tracing now this is
for data center yes GPUs primarily they
haven't made any announcements about
like their gaming graphics cards that
they have coming out eventually they
haven't said anything about that but we
know I mean it is I guess it's
encouraging to know that at the
architectural level it supports that
yeah more at least up there even like
thinking about it which isn't too
surprising but having a confirm is nice
now that's cool James wrote that this
puts the architecture on par with
cheering as far as DXR goes and makes it
superior to solutions that rely on
software or gpgpu acceleration which is
basically saying it's hardware
acceleration what we're better than
software accelerant yeah yeah
racing for big-budget movies like Pixar
films is done traditionally on CPUs
because they are a hundred percent
accurate unfortunately they are also
orders of magnitude slower so I mean
this is yet another one of these entries
in the Sega of Intel GPUs that I think
that we're all trying to get excited
about it we're like oh how great would
it be if we had another competitor and
that's in a space other than AMD and
NVIDIA but because no offense AMD isn't
doing that great right now in that space
it's wonderful that AMD is doing
fantastic and the CPU side of things hmm
but it would be kind of nice if like AMD
had to dual compete for a long time but
didn't have the money or the resources
to really do it right and Intel kind of
does so if it ends up being Intel that
has to do a compete and anybody's more
like yeah CPUs are great that's morally
better I think that would make more
sense the strong should take the burden
for the week and these been you know AMD
you've been trying so hard and we love
you tradition you know we love you I'm
really happy that they they've got a
winner right now their CPUs are doing
awesome
heck yeah really cool rise in 3000
generation coming soon good stuff we got
a navvy GPU Oh supposed to come out by
the end of 2019 not seven nanometers
confident well personally the the rumors
and leaks and stuff that I saw indicate
that it's going to be like a replacement
for Polaris instead of Vega so it's
gonna be like their lower power yeah
which kind of sucks because like I've
been like following this like all these
Navi e-news and stuff and I'm like oh
it's gonna be it's gonna take out like
cheering or pascal or whatever I'm like
nope it's gonna be low power stuff again
I'm not a yeah yeah that's really
exciting though I have a little bit of a
hard time getting properly actually
excited about like non like like things
that are definitely not for consumers
there's stuff where it's like it's
enterprise stuff but you can get your
hands on it it's great this is like data
center hardware so right ok that's cool
that's definitely cool you know like hey
technology and another company entering
in space and all that kind of stuff kind
of way but it's not super likely that a
bunch of people that I will interact
with will get their hands on it it's
less cool and then it's it's if it ends
up being a rumor that this is coming to
consumer stuff it'll also be hard for me
to personally get excited about until
I'm like yes it is actually definitely
coming well you're talking about ray
tracing on Intel GPUs yeah see this is
what we know dedicated hardware I mean
well we don't okay we don't know this
but the PlayStation 5 is supposed to
have ray tracing that's what the the
system architect said he's like it's
based on an AMD GPU and it's gonna
support ray tracing so I'm like if the
PS 5 does ray tracing
I actually Intel better freaking do it I
saw your tech linked thing with like
that sort of reaction is that was
perfect it was like the ray tracing
console masteries know
console master race pc plebs what have
you done tech news reporting through a
would you even call that through a
console lens no no but uh like like for
not an iteration of a specific type like
not the Xbox one X not the Xbox one s
but the original Xbox one
oh yeah it's like this is a much larger
step than we got from the S to the X or
from the one yeah I think when I first
started at NCIX I think like ps4
launching then yeah that was like so
that was 2013 yeah I know it was around
that line but I think wait longer like
that winter mm-hmm so like I think one
of the first netlink dailies we did was
about the Xbox one oh that's kind of
cool ya know it gets a little wild
because right when the consoles first
launched they usually actually like
really competitive right and everything
gets all has a challenger and then a
couple years ago playing it's like it's
like oh it's the ps4 get rekt oh the ps4
is way more yeah it's fun though I I
actually really enjoy new console
launches because even it's I mean it's
cool too it's a little bit harder to
judge consoles compared to each other so
that's kind of fun because you have to
do a lot of like more deeper dives cuz
not as easy to like swap and component
out and Testament there's alright but
then it's also fun to see the PC space
have really solid competition on terms
of price of performance right as the new
console just drops and you're like oh
this is gonna be a really interesting
console generation launch because I feel
like diffuser also really expensive for
you so is RAM gp's are expensive but
also the like gaming ecosystem and the
the environment is kind of like
streaming is becoming a big thing and
like the the Xbox one X and the ps4 Pro
are like some of the most like PC side
like and then rate racing coming out now
and as far as I know both of the new
consoles are going to have key
most support yeah they already do I
think yeah yeah it's not like why
wouldn't they still have that so yeah
they have ray-tracing strong graphics
very like PC like architecture keyboard
a mouse support right like prepackaged
yeah well progression computers you plug
into your TV right that only play games
well I think like I hopefully I've hope
every times we report on something that
Microsoft is doing like with the Xbox
ecosystem and PC gaming like they've
said so many times they're like we care
about PC gamers and we want it you know
we want we want you to use the Xbox Live
app on your PC that a discord or
whatever like come on guys we're adding
spotify support to the game bar on
Windows 10 like come on so like I keep
every time they make an announcement
like this I'm like oh do they actually
care like are they actually gonna try to
kind of unify these like Xbox and PC
gaming units ecosystems like unify as in
like you buy an xbox and it basically
acts as a PC like a prebuilt gaming PC
or something you know yeah yeah it would
be cool if you could do that all I want
all I wanna sell on your xbox that'll be
that'll be the day yeah all I wanted all
this time is halo on PC it's coming I
know it's coming heck yeah I'm excited
speaking of all you've ever wanted we
should do sponsors yes we should
speaking of which the first one there
you go
fresh books books you know we couldn't
do this show without our sponsors guys
and we gotta talk about him cuz we love
them fish books is the super simple to
use invoicing tool that actually does a
lot more than just help you make
beautiful slick looking invoices it
helps you track your time with their
timesheet function manage expenses and
keeps track of who owes you what it also
has a feature that tells you when
clients look at your invoice for the
first time so you know if they're not
responding to you just because they're
trying to avoid you or if they've
actually seen what you've yeah hey
client please pay me for the work that I
graciously there's my money the mobile
app has all the functionality of the
desktop app which is great so you can
take fresh books with you wherever you
go you're not like it's nice to work on
a computer but you don't have to do
everything there if you're on a jobsite
and you need to do something really
quick you can do it which is great
if you have any questions feel free to
reach out to the support staff they'll
speak to a real human no phone tree no
escalation is no return calls just an
answer which is great visit fresh books
calm /when and enter wham into the how
did you hear about a section when you
sign up for a free trial what that's it
yeah BAM love fresh books but you know
else we'd love to have a jerk jerky you
wanna look at this I do what they're
jerky is made with the best ingredient
right without nitrates or preservatives
with a goal to create a snack that is
full of flavor and spice but it's not
bad for you yeah it actually makes you
stronger don't quote me on that
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky like sriracha bacon and maple
buffalo bacon lots of bacon here big
bacon fans they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub for the shower
not for the shower it's for me it's for
meat you could I'm assuming or whatever
technically we're meat
they're Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses
one of the hottest peppers in the world
dude hottest peppers use offer code LTT
to save 10% on all of their products
including all of these delicious have
you had the Reaper one I did I had it
one time I like spice logo because they
have they have like flavors along sprite
yeah yeah these are good because the
spice is kind of part of it I'm not a
huge fan of like taking spice like hot
sauce and putting it on other things
okay if you give me a food and it is
naturally spicy I'll like I will eat
that English is really bad at explaining
spice because they have they have like
the Moho stuff and it's like lime and
cilantro and like oh all these other
kind of things in like it has spices
like mojito I think it's pronounced the
same way but it's just Momo is that the
base
is that the base word for mojito mojito
I have no idea you said lime I think a
mojito has lime in it that's the
defining minute but first huh
no go do it is that what I do do you
want to do it private area accesses it
like doesn't you know it's not that
important because they already have it
oh so nice would this supports a variety
of VPN protocols and types of encryption
and authentication allowing you to dial
in the exact level privacy you need one
of my favorite things about it which
isn't listed right there but if you if
your if something happens with the VPN
and the VPN disconnects it will cut out
your internet so there's no like the the
VPN doesn't stop and then a bunch of
packets get through unencrypted
unprotected they cut everything down
which is absolutely super cool it's like
when you get stabbed and then you put a
bandage right on it right away you know
lose anything important as I'm here for
it's great illustration heck yeah they
have apps for Windows Mac OS Android iOS
it still says Linus I and Google Chrome
was support for several other platforms
coming soon they have over 3000 bare
metal servers in 44 locations across 28
countries you can connect up to five
devices at the same time or you know if
your family members happen to be using
those devices I you know under you know
under the table you know you don't have
to expect them to turn it off I guess
apps include DNS leak protection and
ipv6 leak protection that's I guess
vaguely what I was talking about before
and IP cooking hide your true IP address
and geographic location it was helpful
if you're in the European Union and
every country almost is trying to take
away the internet from you
or so why would you go to Africa as far
as I know and a few other places check
it out today at LM GGG /p Oh an ya w a n
yeah PL 1 p.m. on my dude PL on my dude
and don't forget it
oh my god are you excited for the new
Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure oh yeah
they're making it I make another one I
needed like oh you lottery the first one
oh there's two there's two see it's been
I I think I watched the first one when I
was like a little kid
yeah but I haven't like seen it since so
all I know is like booted or excellent
yeah
I'm people are gonna hate me I'm sorry
guys look I have a cursory knowledge of
Bill and Ted I'm pretty excited which
probably makes me old but whatever
should talk about LTX now should we talk
about the thing you really love so I
almost I went all the way up Tarek so
I'm so excited but we can talk about
that's a good idea
well there's some updates I don't know
if we talked about the updates last time
what updates are see those updates
they're bolded oh they're bolded guys oh
I don't know if we talked about this
okay
updates LTX 2019 just case you didn't
know which would be surprising Dreamhack
and lioness media group are coming
together and making this awesome
convention slash huge land party in
Vancouver at the Vancouver Convention
Center you should check it out website
is not linked here that's pretty sure if
you search LTX 2019 it'll come up it'll
come it's pretty solid
they're organizing panels for the main
stage so they're wondering what you guys
want to see discussed hit them up with
ideas on the forum or on Twitter at LTX
Expo and yes the ex and Expo are
redundant but don't worry about that I'm
upset as of this morning so there's
probably less now there was only 16 Bui
o TYC tickets left b ox eos if you want
to be Ock you better be on over to the
site and get a ticket buddy
like actually cuz they're they're gonna
be gone snazzy cue from snazzy labs
that's who
cool and where Nelson are also gonna be
at LTF and hardware connects Demetri and
Eber yeah I haven't seen those guys well
I've never met Clint Quinn but I sort of
know Dimitri Niebuhr that's exciting
have you met then you sort you said you
sort of know I sort of know it like I've
met them okay yeah yeah they're super
cool I mean I wouldn't say that we talk
all the time no I think Dimitri and I we
have each other on on Facebook that's
fine so there's like you know you guys
get invited to each other's like Super
Bowl parties no because he lives way the
heck yeah that'd be hard yeah yeah yeah
you could do telepresence just like
you're gonna watch the Super Bowl with
me he's like I have stuff to do hey
there it's like really late for you but
day in the computer you live in there
you don't get to sleep but yeah come to
LTX guys it's gonna be great July 27th
and 28th is that right that is correct
sweet I'm super excited my whole
floatplane team is coming in locally
heck yeah
we're doing the like meet up at that
time so we're gonna hang out after LTX
and everyone's gonna meet up for LT exes
can be great you know be really cool as
if we had an actual floodplain and I
don't know why I'm suggesting going
because I really you haven't seen this
Oh like the computer thing yeah oh yeah
yeah yeah that'll be fun but there's
also the Vancouver Convention Center can
technically receive flow plates so I was
sure I was running with this like idea
for the problem is it was it was just
there's no way the ROI on this would
ever work but I wanted vias and I to fly
into the convention on a float plane
riding on top of the wing speaking of
crazy ideas epic games buys oh here we
go
I was waiting tense okay so this I've
been wanting to talk about this to for a
while yeah because I have feelings me
too
I don't know what kind of arms over this
yeah you want to hit me up oh I'll hit
you up dude cuz I know all about the
streaming setup and this is how you do
it
boom boom done sorry Onix is joining
EPIK family oh that's so green they
didn't they didn't just buy a game they
didn't just buy out the rights to
platform a game yeah they bought a whole
studio about the whole thing so now I'll
temper the the initial like kind of
outrage like by the fact that apparently
the people who made psionics this is
what I read in a thing the people who
started psionics kind of already know a
lot of the people at Epic Games and they
like have these like connections so this
isn't like a big giant company coming in
and force brute-forcing you know the
company to do right although it might be
that I don't know but that's some
evidence to the contrary yeah so the big
problem for me about this was that the
initial announcement was kind of like
vague they're like we're buying psionics
rocket league is coming to the store and
in the meantime they said rocket League
will be supported on Steam and
thereafter Steam users can look forward
to continued support but there is
nothing like concrete that says like
everyone on Steam will get the same
updates there will be cross-platform
support like you can play multiplayer
still if you buy the game on Epic Games
Store will you still be able to play
cross-platform with steam users like
there is there is an editor's note at
the bottom of the article yeah it says
we want to clarify something for you
which like isn't this isn't good enough
that's what I'm saying super clear yeah
but it says we want to clarify for you
after today's news rocket league is and
remains available on Steam anyone who
owns our colleague through Steam can
still play it and can look forward to
continued support I know exactly what
you just said right for how long you
know yeah and like does I'm sure it does
but this would be the time to clarify a
lot better than it is like two line
thing at the bottom of an article does
support include like feature updates mmm
which it almost certainly does but they
should spell that out and I think this
is a problem nothing up to question this
is one of the big problems that a lot of
people you know caught up in this Steam
versus epic game store fight have with
epic game store is
they've kind of been like kind of
wishy-washy about people's concerns
regarding oh there's not many features
on epic game store and you know how long
are these timed exclusives are they
always exclusives are you gonna keep
doing this and like stealing games from
other stores are you gonna kind of stop
eventually
what's what's going on guys one thing
that I thought was interesting was that
Tim Sweeney the CEO of Epic Games
tweeted recently I don't have the tweet
here but he tweet back to us oh yeah he
tweeted recently that if if steam I
don't know if you saw this if Steam
committed to matching their developer
revenue share so valve takes a 30% cut I
believe it's something pretty beefy yeah
and the big news teams only takes a 12%
cut okay also those 18 but you're
probably right I'm pretty sure I'm
pretty sure it's 88% to the developers
well yeah yeah you're right right so if
they're like if steam matches our
revenue sharing model we will stop with
the exclusives we'll stop it immediately
and back off that's what Tim Sweeney
said on Twitter and I think I think I'd
say that because he knows that valve
isn't gonna do that cuz like to me I see
that and I'm kind of like oh all right
well then all valve has to do is just
kind of match their revenue share yeah
but I think valve has like too many
things going on now you I've been
talking a lot what are your feelings
well I'm so conflicted
yeah we're talking about this a little
bit I tried to not think about this
since I heard about it because I knew
we're gonna talk about on the show even
that thing that you just mentioned with
the revenue share thing like I've got
tons of feelings about that too because
steam is kind of this like old right
lethargic giant at this point like
everyone in the PC community as far as I
can tell
loves them but realistically they've
just kind of existed forever and like
yeah not done a ton for quite a while
and I think that's what's made an
obscene amount of money
yeah not done a lot with it about this
whole situation is that I feel like
valve has kind of grown a bit complacent
yeah like you know you have complete
your Ubisoft you know an Activision
Blizzard like making their own launchers
and Bethesda and but they're not like
really making an attempt to kind of come
at steam they're just like hey our games
are on our platform this Walter and a
lot of times our games are also on Steam
you know Ruby soft sometimes still
releases Ubisoft games on Steam yeah but
at the game store is coming out here and
being like we need to shake this up and
I feel like that's it's it's kind of
conflicting because on the one hand you
know you know that steam has kind of
become complacent yeah and that they
have all these really cool features and
they've been there since beginning you
know basically I'd like they do to be
clear they have way better features oh
yeah big game story for sure like it's a
better situation over there yeah it's
just they've been around forever and a
lot of these features are pretty old and
some of the newer features that come out
are not that substantial hmm right like
it it definitely feels like valve does
the minimum viable yeah thing that they
need to do in order to not make people
horribly mad at them yeah you know I
think this is really well illustrated by
the fact that we don't have half-life 3
yet yes and I'm upset because they
didn't need to because I we make you
know like 30 percent of what everybody
else does yeah yeah
so whatever just make tons of man we
don't need to let's not worry about it
they're like let's make another dota
card game dad some hats
I want to get over it I want to get over
half-life 3 but here's the thing
oh this leads well into another thing
did you see that Valve index yeah so
like because they have a flagship VR
game apparently coming on yeah with the
index yeah but what does that mean it's
the worst because it might be having a
PR would be really cool but it won't be
with then and if it was half-life VR is
it actually Meany good I'm upset look it
might be good I'm so upset I don't know
I didn't get an index
know how that makes me feel what do you
mean maybe order it well it sold out
like him immediately you're the VR guy
yeah but it was just gone
yeah I think in 15 or 20 minutes it's
yeah yeah I was busy
I mean I'll probably you know probably
good eventually but like yeah well
probably I mean I suspect last media
group will get one hopefully that out
hopefully but anyways I like I famous so
for us we cross-platform thing with
psionics and raleigh will be fine my
reasons for that is because they support
such a wide variety of cross-platform
already they support cross-platform
friends lists as far as I know there was
a fairly a personality yes that's what I
meant
there's a fairly recent update that
stepped away from the steam friends list
which is maybe not that surprising
anymore I was actually pretty happy they
did because maybe they did it because I
kind of think they did because I think
they're prepping themselves for that
and they I think they should have leaned
on that more in their article thing if
you've been like yeah steams gonna be
supported we separated the friends list
from the steam layer so you could work
on the the epic game store but if you
notice you're on Steam and it's working
so we made sure that's fine like that
probably would have been a good idea
yeah but I think it'll keep working for
everyone I love to watch I only play the
ice hockey mode because I'm weird but I
love to watch yeah like various rocket
League creators sunless condomless cuz
amazing great I always also watch like
left Amir and a bunch of other guy I
don't know those guys yeah he's more on
the competitive side so most cons just a
beautiful human being but in a smooth
voice he does
sultry rocket League essays if you could
imagine that it's possible but anyways I
love watching all that kind of stuff
even though I don't play with the soccer
ball I just play ice hockey had a fairly
high level I'm by myself that's but this
this does bother me because I've been
playing ragga League relatively
seriously for years and it's scary when
something you care about a lot is
getting touched what I'm hoping for
is steam side of things I mean it's
gonna leave the steam store but outside
of that I hope it just doesn't get
affected and I hope that it going to the
epic game store and it being in the news
because of this by a out and all that
kind of stuff is going to boom its
popularity right because while there's
definitely still a strong community
around rocket League it could use a
little bit its bit it's been out for
quite a while that's one of those usual
boosts that's one of the strong points
of this acquisition one of the few rays
of see this is the thing it looks so
depressing until you kind of look into
and you're kind of probably be fine yeah
like Epic Games has this like obscene
amount of money yeah somehow I guess
they just have buckets of money to pay
off people to be exclusives but that
money is going to help psyonix kind of
like inject some more life into their
eSports yeah ambitions which is good
that would that would be fantastic I
love rocket League eSports it's one of
my favorite things to watch eSports wise
I used to love watching Starcraft oh
yeah and I'd stay up till weird hours in
the morning and watch GSL and watched
live Korean games and I was super into
it right now Stark I've kind of died a
little bit and then I got I'm kind of
into rocket League I mostly like
watching the YouTube videos but I have
enjoyed watching squishy muffins and all
those crazy guys but I don't know I hope
it goes well I I wish them the best even
though it makes me a little salty I'm
not happy that it's leaving steam
because if one of my friends wants to
get into it it's usually the path of
least resistance we're going to get them
into it on steam if I have to start
getting people to install the epic games
launcher that is going to be a problem I
will say I will say that like because
this particular instance isn't as like
to me it doesn't seem as horrible of a
proposition because rocket League
psionic has already psionics has already
done the work to Ross working so like if
they're like oh I want to buy rocket
League and then you know they just go to
the rocket League site and the way they
do that is by downloading launchers oh
yeah yeah and then they just come in and
they tell you their username and then
you add them within the game if that
still works and all the cross-platform
stuff works fine it's like
not the were sweet but like epic games
need to make needs to make sure that
they do this for every game that they do
this too
you know and that's that that's the the
fear I think bit of a kicker that
another thing that I want to consider
here is raagh League again made quite a
while ago still doing pretty good but
and I mean their season passes hopefully
those are doing well I play the game so
freaking much that I buy the season pass
because I'm like my dollar per hour in
this game right now is absurd Rhys can
take a little bit more money yeah there
you go that's fair I'll vote with my
wallet in the direction that most people
don't I think and try to support the
thing because I believe in the thing but
I can't imagine they're doing amazing
Sonics yeah yeah
so the ingest of money is going to
hopefully increase long-term support for
the game which we've kind of discussed
already but it's also probably just good
for the creator's well I don't I haven't
heard of psionics working on necessarily
anything else I could be ignorant here
but I think this is kind of all they got
this is their this is a big once trick
pony yeah so I mean trick rocket car if
it sometimes if you want the thing to
survive you gotta do some stuff that's a
little uncomfortable so I don't know
ain't that the truth
yeah and I you don't love about rocket
League too is that it seems like it it
doesn't have like mechanics it has
mechanics that you don't see in any
other game like it's not like it's a
MOBA you know where there are 18
different MOBAs that all are the same
yeah rocket League is rocket League
there is no other game like it so if we
can if that like ecosystem can survive
yeah through an influx of cash from evil
Tim Sweeney you know that's Darth Vader
I got a lot of money bud and it'll feed
your family for a year which and your
family starving would you take it but I
love it I yeah I don't know very very
interesting
thing yeah do we ever do have we talking
about different things in our
I think we're it's sort of done here's a
here's one last question all right
if half-life 3 yeah is a videogames buys
half-life oh my gosh can you imagine
let's just draw so much money that
whatever such an interesting like
alternate universes like proposition
like they buy the rights to half-life we
get half-life 3 the thing that steam and
valve fans have been wanting for years
and and they hate they've they've got
worked up to hate Epic Games they're
like oh they're the worst thought we
hate them so much and they're like but
we have half-life 3
yeah it's not even it's not even that
they like bought the rights to it they
just funded the entire project yeah yeah
and it mean and it's good yeah yeah what
would you do if you interesting to see
how you do yeah
sorry what was your question up
something with the index you had such a
you changed it and that was brilliant
would you would you buy it if the epic
Oh games store cat half-life 3 isn't
exclusive I think you have to yeah
like depending obviously I don't think
every human on the planet has to buy it
but like I think I would have to it's
the amount of pure curiosity oh you know
I don't think it's gonna be like I want
I really want it to be but I don't think
it's gonna be half-life 3
I don't think it I don't think that'll
be an IKE ship vr game that they're
gonna release is half way 3 or even in a
half-life universe I think that's gonna
be really cool if it's a portal thing
probably or like a left 4 dead 3 thing
or whatever left 4 dead VR but I think
that the honestly I think that for valve
the half-life ship has sailed
I don't think we'll ever get it and but
this is so annoying cuz every time this
news comes up I'm like oh maybe please
and you know they like that and hate it
at the same time yes I know Gabe Newell
is like kind of openly said like this is
but knowing but at the same time gabe
newell has said half-life is annoying
well like the community constantly be
like hey give us a flick through we want
that thing that you said you were
working on and we're definitely going to
give us and then you gave up on yeah
shut up about that I'm rolling all my my
love Marni Marni more money like rolling
on the floor at his house mr. Gabe
Newell I'm the God of peace please me oh
my goodness I think with that the show
is probably over
that's it yeah yeah how can you top that
I don't I don't understand yeah
sorry I got carried away no those this
isn't tech linked ok guys you have to
have a little bit freeform is there an
outro that yeah you run the intro gets
the same thing you just run the intro
it's super creative yeah I mean
technique of an intro or outro so I
shouldn't talk there you go yeah
just want to give you some on but you
know I think that's a quicksand
we can give you a quick Sam but the
problem with
all right well visit you gotta tell
these sponsors again yeah
hey here's fresh private Internet access
yeah when don't don't that's the wrong
link actually that probably works but
it's not my fault no it's not you're
correct okay well in that case savage
jerky yeah and the sub loves them so
much and love you too
oh I was talking to the audience Wow
fresh books calm slash 1 when the Wan
show the Wan show no I don't want and
only the obi-wan and now you stop yes
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
