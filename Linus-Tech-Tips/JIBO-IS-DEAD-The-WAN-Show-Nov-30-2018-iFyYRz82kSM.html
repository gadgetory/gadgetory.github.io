tune into that disaster by any chance
were you streaming it while I was at
work I know oh well still know okay fair
enough
so I did like a 10-year anniversary
stream with Yvonne as kind of uh you and
Yvonne Indiana ten years no no we have
we've we've been together longer than
that's really ambiguous yeah so it was
ten to ten year Linus tech tips
anniversary
okay so Linus tech tips was started on
the 25th of November 25 26 whatever it
was 25th or 26th of November 2008 ten
years ago this whole enterprise began
and so I thought it might be a cool idea
to do like kind of a behind the scenes
slash like Q&amp;amp;A like a get-to-know-you
free bond because a lot of people think
that like I brought my wife to work kind
of thing like there's been a lot of
comments about like what's his wife
doing at work and what does that mean
ridiculous it means that like okay and
to be clear I get it
because I worked at a place where the
boss brought his wife to work what has
brought your wife work I mean brought
your wife to work means that for some
reason the owner of the company's wife
is there every day and barking orders at
people even though she clearly has no
idea what's going on so in that if
someone were to do that does that does
the boss's wife have formal employment
there yes okay she did in this case and
of course Yvonne does here yes so a lot
of people seem to think that that's how
things went down but it's not at all
she's actually been involved since
basically day one and so I thought it
would be cool to do like a stream to
like kind of get to know her and find
out you know what's what's going on what
she's done here over the years because
it's not insignificant at all and I
think it's just you're just lucky that
your wife having to be competent is that
the only difference here no cuz I don't
see any reason why I would have involved
her if she hadn't been
like and it's not just that like she
drove me to make almost every major
career decision that I have made in the
last like we've actually been together
like 13 years or something like that's
been quite a long time only married for
eight of it though so so she was the one
actually driving me she drove me to drop
out of school which to be clear was
actually the correct decision for me
she only drove me to do that not because
she doesn't believe in school she
finished her degree she just knew it
would have taken line us forever to
graduate maybe the plan was dependents
she figured if I didn't get educated
then I'd be stuck with her yet a lot of
people don't know this actually that's
another thing there's a lot of
speculation that she's a gold digger
actually she had much better prospects
when we met active she's a pharmacist
yes I don't know why she works here um
so she was so she was and she was in
pharmacy school when I met her so she
had just she wasn't in the pharmacy
program yet when we started dating but
she got in shortly after we started
dating so she was on a very clear
trajectory and I was on academic
probation at UBC at that time so I was
on a very clear trajectory as well why
are we going probation I wasn't smoking
the boys room academic probation for
getting poor grades academic probation
it was gonna take you forever to
graduate if I ever did know I would have
gotten kicked out the only reason I
didn't get kicked out was because I left
you can't kick me out if just I quit I'm
out here I'm out here like they would I
don't think they would ever let me back
in that school so where are you taking
it I was taking general science and I
couldn't pass calculus for the life of
me she was your tutor was she not she
was my tutor but that was only because
there was an interest that was not
because I was like out looking for a
tutor I just wouldn't have found a tutor
and I would have probably gotten an even
worse grade if not for her and that
would have been impressive actually
because I got 19% the first time around
in calc 101 or 100
whatever it is so so anyway but worried
about retirement right so anyway I so I
remember making this joke at the time
because I was at around the time that I
was dropping out to work for as a sales
rep at a computer store and I so I
forget what someone said to me but
something like you know you know your
wife's gonna be the breadwinner in the
future like this is speculation we
weren't even close to getting married at
that point and I kind of went yeah you
know what we live in enlightened times
you know there's men can go to
university for their Mrs these days
there's nothing wrong with that
because there's this old sexist joke
that men go to school men go to college
or men go to university for their bas
their MAS and their PhDs and what do
women go to university for their Mrs and
so I was like so it's kind of like a
play on that very terrible joke it means
missus yeah means they're gonna it means
like marrying someone who's gonna have a
BA in na or a PhD that's so anyway I
thought that was all that I got out of
school was my mrs yeah well I mean I
think it's like the trend is the other
way now like um almost the majority of
couples couples I know the woman makes
more really in my wife's friend group
it's like that huh yeah maybe your
wife's friend group though is just like
highly educated highly driven women and
maybe that no they're not highly
educated they are how they drove their
all in sales
that's where the money is at sales is
actually super underrated in oh you have
great ten you want to make $200,000 a
year sales yeah career in personal
planning should probably focus on sales
skills and hold hold on give me one
second I want to finish that thought
from before at the point is we tried to
do that stream I managed to fail three
times over the course of like four days
we finally got it done last night go
check it out my calculus yeah actually
my grade in streaming is a slightly
higher than that that's 25% it's so
weird because in this world in this
studio and in the YouTube world and this
computer world like you know you're the
master of your domain here in this
this little lioness world we live in
it's weird for me to think of lioness
like looking at a piece of paper and
just being like I don't get it
I don't know what to do I'm failing I
was so frustrated forget it I give up I
can't think about this right now I'm
just gonna go play counter-strike
that was that was and she was like well
you should you should just give up you
should drop out it was less that it was
more that I was sinking worse and worse
into depression and clearly what I was
doing with the painting business and
school where nothing was a success was
not helping and this actually segues so
perfectly into our talk about how
important sales is because all of a
sudden I had this opportunity to take
this job at the computer store that was
not a ton of money but because there was
a commission there was the potential to
kind of scale it and I was really
passionate about it like I got a job at
NCIX because I was that kid on their
forum that was constantly already a
Salesman and an ethical one like I
wasn't about people just buying more I
wasn't I wasn't even on commission I
didn't I wasn't even on the company
payroll I was just hanging out on their
forum cuz the NCIX forum was quite
frankly the shiz back in like the mid
2000s it was awesome a super active
great community there fantastic people
can't say enough cam you know who you
are you're awesome
anyone who can your camp but but anyway
so I was already this kid hanging out in
their forum basically doing the sales
job which is advising people of what the
right thing to buy is and helping them
pick it and and making them making that
relationship to NCIX
make it more likely that they probably
buy it from NCIX
so even though they thought I was too
young and they were looking for
full-time people and I was only
available part time they made this this
kind of this weird exception for me and
I and I started my job there and it was
it's amazing how much of life is sales
and how applicable the sales skills that
I kind of gained
just by being an enthusiast and getting
a job where my whole job was just to
talk about my passion all day it's
amazing how that is actually a big part
of how I was able to end up where I am
today and I'll preach I'll preach sales
training and and sales skills all day to
anyone who will listen because if you
think about it what in life is not sales
engineering yes but I would make the
argument that without sales all these
aspects right the engineers are probably
in trouble you got to make your pitch
you got to make your pitch to get the
funding to build the thing sure kept the
project approved sure there's sales and
engineering come on
well I'm yourself a YouTube chat give me
something here it's synonymous with
communication we're gonna be abstracted
like that yes so everything's finding a
finding a partner in life sales you've
got it you gotta sell them on what's
have I got a deal for you what's good
about you you know why why they should
care why they should go on that first
date that's sales sales is all about
persuasive communication and calling it
sales I think is sort of unfair it's
just that that's usually the word at the
end of whatever job title it is or
associate it's like the whole secretary
receptionist thing you know garbageman
waste management you know technician
whatever it it's if we're being honest
with ourselves it's its sales but I
think that also isn't really fair to the
complexity of that position because it's
all about building relationships and
getting to know people and if you are
genuinely good at it actually caring
actually building real relationships
that still exists beyond cutting the PIO
and making the payment transactional
that's not real sales and I think that's
where a lot of sales training sucks
well actually sales has changed in the
last couple decades because there used
to be an information disparity between
the customer and the salesperson where
you walked in to buy a car you were
dependent on the salesperson to tell you
everything about the car because you had
no way
finding that stuff out by yourself now
we have the Internet everyone has access
to information you walk in the store
knowing more about the thing you want to
buy then the salesperson does so where
in the past extra extroverts they really
thrive to sales people before now it's
more of kind of you need to be in the
middle of that spectrum so that you can
listen to what they person already knows
and what they want and then just help
kind of funnel them in Plinko game to
the best solution mathematics research
Linus even then like you probably have
to apply for like research grants and
stuff you have to you have to get a job
and get tenure at a university or
something before anyone's gonna actually
pay you to do mathematics research I
don't know yes a little it's a little
tenuous because what you're talking
about is true but it might be like 2% of
their actual day-to-day job yes that's
true plus they're gonna get the tenure
after publishing a bunch fair enough
fair enough
people have a really good news today
we're gonna roll the intro sure let's
roll the intro no promises on the news
though okay
retros
MOS mas mas o Smaug another dangit James
take this face out also recognizer
alright alright alright alright alright
alright
I don't want James to be upset so we
will do one tech news topic today the
one that upsets me the most what upsets
not just you both of us the most
oh well that's my document I mean I
guess I kind of spoiled it without
actually going to the biz drills ecology
bow is dead know anyone but debo you not
here's an innocent this was ji bow rest
in peace debo okay I know that half of
you are gonna get Bend from the
Chancellor but can we all please just
press f7 famous Baxter just please stop
the crying whenever other youtubers do
apology videos I think you're so bad and
yeah so Jibo as a company's ever
apologized for anything because I know
you guys are too smart for that kind of
crap actually I pop you should apologize
for pandering so who do I pander to okay
so no I'm serious no I'll do the news
later just now who died Patterson when
you just said you guys you're out too
smart
well they're all right I think our
audience is genuine okay tell you what I
have I have an exercise for you set
aside 20 minutes okay spend 10 minutes
clicking on random ltte videos and
reading like the top ten comments and
just kind of going through then log out
of YouTube and like fire up a VPN or
something so that doesn't know who you
are and just start clicking on like top
videos on YouTube and really tough ten
comments on each of them come back and
tell me our audience isn't a little
smart they are
look this is objective okay this is not
tanking this is just actual fact anyway
tell me tell me about tell you about G
but the points here just a year after
Gebo landed on the cover of Time
magazine that was a whole lot this is a
whole other Wrather problem like time
officially is a rag they they made a
listicle of their like 10 most
innovative tech products try it obvious
not only did they not try it they didn't
even read a review or watch a video cuz
everyone was unanimous it was so bad it
was just so useless sorry yeah Jibo
sucked okay anyway there's parts that
were good just a year after Jibo landed
on the cover of Time magazine
the company has closed down for good
Gebo apparently sold this intellectual
property assets to new york-based sq and
venture partners who apparently are like
the vultures of the 10th year world and
evidence of hedge accumulated for months
including a round of layoffs in June an
empty office space in July these are
these are these are these are evidence
these are flags right a flag blog hasn't
been updated since May there's no longer
an option to buy geebo on the web site
although the website is still
operational
ok is it really ok I'm gonna fire that
up now go ahead carry on the founded in
2012 I believe by a was an MIT professor
who studied social robotics yeah
something to do with like robotic
movement her last name was like similar
to the word Brazil anyway found in 2012
the company was right the company raised
more than 3.5 million dollars during a
2014 into gift IndieGoGo campaign didn't
you I backed it you back there I have
the shirt you know what hold on a second
go get that shirt I'm gonna go get that
shirt alright he's gone and I went on to
collect about 70 million dollars in
institutional venture capital you
literally you did
I mean the venture capital K I mean the
venture capitalists are they that do
they just have nothing better to spend
money I'm gonna go get the shirt after
that it was 2012 do you know what we
could do with seventy million dollars
nobody has ever offered us seventy
million dollars you can't even pass
calculus but we could hire we have more
revenue than Jibo uh actually I actually
don't know that they actually seem to
have sold a fair number of these stupid
things so and they're like $700 okay I
don't actually know that they're more
than that it was 2012 though so it's a
little different because anyone can see
today you back he's yelling saying that
who backed it it was unrealistic but he
backed it's obviously no one can hear
you silence but the thing that you
didn't know in 2012 was that there was
going to be inexpensive fairly
intelligent virtual assistants in every
home like Linus is saying that Siri
already existed true true stopping no
one can hear you stop yelling at me I
can't I can't find it I'm not yelling at
you I'm yelling I'm yelling to you
you're yelling
okay easily so here's so here's the
thing we we didn't we didn't know that
like Amazon was gonna win or anything
like that but we knew that inexpensive
digital assistants were coming because
they already existed Siri already
existed what were the odds that this
weird robot that doesn't move like like
the demos made no sense like oh gee Bo
we'll take a picture for you right I'm
gonna go get this thing
plug it in and position it why don't I
just go get a camera at that point why
there's just no reason for anything that
it was in the debt it just made no sense
I backed geebo because I knew that it
was ever delivered it was going to be a
dumpster fire and I wanted to be the
first one in on the action that's why I
would say I would say you burnt your
eyebrows right off you
the thing that let's talked about geebo
in the end though was that thing by the
yeah think there's a crux of it by the
time it arrived it did have I think
fantastic what did you call the
animatronics the way that it moves the
way it dances was super lifelike it was
like looking at a Pixar character in
front of you it's super awesome that's
true and the way they did that with just
the three four sections four segments of
the body really it was really elegant
and the thing that sucked was was the
onboard computation the AI that yeah and
by the time it arrived in 2017 that had
been figured out by Google and Amazon
and maybe even Siri and it would lesser
degree Apple if they had just plugged in
like if it was just geebo operated by
the Google assistant yes it would be way
better it still wouldn't have been
enough at that price point it still
would have had to have been three or
four hundred dollars it would have had
to be a decent music speaker at 399 with
like what else would it have had to do
an OLED screen yeah because that really
ruined it if you look at this can you
put up that under this screen all the
the pictures that you see are like that
where it's like wow it's this pure black
screen with just an eyeball that moves
around it has all this emotion but when
you actually had it in front of you you
could see the LCD screen it was a it was
like light gray instead of a black
against the background and it made
people thought that it was a big they
thought that it looked like a big mouth
I thought those square screen looked
like a mouth and that its eyes were like
they're the time the time line picture
you can see that so you can see see
those surface at the top those are the
cameras and people thought that those
look like eyes and that the big square
was a giant mouth and it looked like
that big imma charge of my laser bra so
OLED screen necessary we actually talked
to them about that at CES and they said
that they just couldn't buy the OLED
screens because they couldn't meet the
minimum order quantities they had to buy
such a volume of them and they weren't
making enough G bows to justify it well
it's a good thing they didn't
push for that that minimum order
quantity because they would have had a
lot more demos that they wouldn't know
what to do with at that point oh yeah I
tell you ma'am the amount of venture
capital money that just gets thrown at
stuff that obviously isn't going to work
yeah it's just mind-blowing to me cuz
that money it's just gone it's just gone
it's not just gone oh no no no a lot of
it a lot of it was paid to the employees
okay we're not since 2012 people put it
back and be economy okay it's not gone
but like if you wanted to just
contribute to putting money back in the
economy why don't you just like donate
to a homeless shelter or to like
obviously there are better ways to just
put money back into the economy than
creating a weird plastic a I like
landfill filler like well that is sad
that imagine just making a mass
mass-market product and all the
environmental damage part of that and
then they're just gonna keep like
getting liquidated nobody cares yeah
that's et for Atari or whatever just
like literally buried them yeah that's
brutal one thing that I feel really
weird about with this one is that I've
never before felt such a visceral
connection to free-market capitalism
like this thing failed for lots of good
reasons but in a way we we definitely
played a role in it failing because well
they made it they made it suck it
arrived at our desk you told the whole
world that it sucked we weren't the only
ones who said it but we're a very
visible channel and so in our own small
way we contributed to these people not
having jobs anymore and that's kind of
crazy I feel like part of me feels bad
but then I'm just like well I'm just
like cog in the wheel of evolution and
free market capitalism sink-or-swim
you guys should have done a better job
and I wouldn't had to do this to you
that's an interesting that's an
interesting take on it you know it's
funny I don't normally think of myself
as having a this is weird
playing a role yeah as sort of playing a
role in
people not having a job anymore but that
is an interesting take on it i just i
guess i maybe i should feel bad because
I'm sure there were very smart people
very intelligent people who worked at G
Bo no question no question but like I
look at it and I go this was so obvious
to me that this wasn't going anywhere
like why didn't you get out like I feel
bad because yes I guess we contributed
to the downfall though to be clear in
this case I don't feel that bad because
I don't think we played that large of a
role but like couldn't you tell you know
well I mean a lot for a lot of people
it's just the job like they know it's
not going to be an awesome product but
they're getting there flushing out the
resume right but here's the thing like I
quit my job when it was clear to me that
the direction of the the trajectory of
the company was not competitive and the
thing is is that it's easy a lot of the
time people say well it's easy for you
to say you know you had an opportunity
to go and do something else and it's
like right but if the trajectory is bad
and the foundational aspects of the
business are bad which it should have
been obvious to anybody who worked there
but this company was not profitable and
not hitting key milestones so investor
money was gonna run up what do you think
is gonna happen so when you can see that
the foundation is rotten and the
trajectory is bad why not go now well
maybe because then later when everyone
all your other colleagues are trying to
find work - well because of the part
that you're working on might be good
like the person who did the animatronics
his resumes his or her resume is still
Austin at the end of it or they'll
probably find a job and there's lots of
things like that I made all the api's
that connect it to I Heart Radio or
wherever like you compartmentalize that
they maybe still are proud of the work
but here's the thing like you had a
pretty long runway here you could kind
of wrap up your current project get
resumes out there you know like well
it's a startup so maybe they had vested
shares like a lot of their pay structure
could have been staying there say okay
that's something I didn't really
consider like when I think about
employee retention you know I really
think about making sure that I maintain
and making sure that everybody who works
here knows that we are maintaining very
strong like foundational strength for
the business like Linus Media Group is
built upon rock not upon wood that is a
rock carpenter limestone's toe in it
it's tall it's granite just number one
on the Mohs hardness scale hardness
scale it's granite you know the hardness
scale yes I know most kill hardened with
ten been yeah what what's the only thing
I can cut a diamond though more Dyna
yeah Oh
headphone users yeah great three facts I
don't even think that's great three
facts Oh more like great nine facts most
part of scale is great eight but like
the whole like walking kind of diamond
that's young that's kid stuff
okay anyway I just I feel bad but I also
feel bad in the same way that like I
feel bad for some of my colleagues who
were left over at NCIX like I feel bad
this sucks but like some of them and
this is this is the funniest thing about
it sort of some of them I had
conversations with like hey it's been
another year you're still there what
gives I'm like yeah you know it's good
for me I'm like right but like this
clearly isn't sustainable why are you
still there
yeah you know like it's I'd rather I'd
rather be the rat that abandoned the
ship then like the one that goes down
with it personally and I think some were
like you were the rat that was like I'm
gonna get into this container and get
shipped off of the ship before it hits
an iceberg and then all the other people
who still work there like the rats
scurrying away from the water in Titanic
you know when they're trapped at the
bottom I have those cages that Irish
people I am proud to say I have not
watched that movie
since its theatrical release I do not
remember and you would have been wait 11
years old yeah hmm 94 was it 94 no it
six I was in the third grade I believe
this is this is an important like event
in your life like you remember Titanic
97 97
I'm guessing yeah so I would have been
11 in 97 yeah 1997 okay oh I'm pretty
good at that it's won money like pet
superpowers okay guessing dates yours
that I've lived through some things you
got a good one for me here bad
superpower it's rarely useful and even
when it's useful all I get is little
brownie points for myself hate guessing
mad he's no fun at parties what yours
9/11 2001 okay so that's easy
I know because that was like way I'm so
stupid I tried that was supposed to be a
joke where the answer was built into the
question no and none of those two
numbers even have to do with the year
yeah no that was like that was one of
the most surreal moments of my life so
living on the west coast like everything
that went down was very much in progress
when my my radio alarmed that when you
woke up when so my alarm clock was tuned
in to news radio because I found that
that woke me up better than music
someone like talking at me and the way
they were talking at me that morning I
thought I was still dreaming I was sure
I was still dreaming I was like this is
the weirdest dream the holy now you
said a swear word I've never said a
swear word in my life look and look it
was a 20-18 yeah
so so the so the so it was like going
off next to me and I was just like I
just kind of lie in bed it's like just
real like yeah yeah I'm awake and like
school off school all that day so like I
remember my grade 9 science teacher was
just you didn't really even say they
will the TV into your class
um yeah he didn't because the science
class always had their own TV right so
he so he didn't really say we weren't
gonna do class that day but he had the
TV on and loud so that like he could
hear and like we didn't have class that
day yeah yeah it was anyway um we could
do we could do another there's no way to
nicely say we had a so let's just who
sponsors yeah let's do our sponsors so
the first one we've got is what the heck
so you're an Nvidia the first one we've
got is moss ah yeah moss organizer so
this is the moss ground a previous
generation you can hold that one and I
will take the moss grande 2018 updated
version what the black ones
so this pack is expandable up to 40
litres and I'm just gonna try and find
the expandable zipper I'm sure it works
similarly to mine but I can't find it
right now it's this one so you can wait
yes it's this one so you can expand it
like that personally I just don't really
use that feature but whatever it's up to
you it fits up to 17 inch laptops you
know you you're the type of dude that
always has a full backpack but not
anymore
Wow when I said when I was riding my
bike this summer to work I was just got
so sick of carrying so much stuff on my
back cuz it's really uncomfortable in a
sport bike posture to carry a heavy
backpack that I was like you know what I
work hard I'm gonna treat myself to a
second one of all the stupid tools that
I keep in my backpack one for work and
one for home so that's why I bought
myself this other orange screwdriver I
bought myself another pair of side
cutters the other pair of pliers the
other pair of Jewish screwdrivers like
all those stupid things that I always
keep in my bag so I'm actually down to I
don't even think this is the same model
is it the same model yeah I think it is
the same model
whatever so this is my bag so the only
things I have in it are my blade my
mouse pad for my blade blade stealth um
oh these phones that I've been meaning
to return to work ha Tyler in the tablet
that's in the tablet pouch I've got my
power bank I've got my sunglasses and
the handy-dandy sunglass like pouch yeah
oh wow
it is armored yeah I've got my mouse is
that for sunglasses no it's down the
once yeah that's the weak side I've
usually got my Powerball on the other
side but right now I have some aspirin
because my knee hurts and it's inflamed
and then I've got my power adapter which
is not supposed to be there I've got
some there's a zipper here sorry you
guys aren't really able to see this but
I've got some USB some chapstick my
angel bird portable SSD business cards
this was this was actually a nice like
best man groomsmen gift it's like got my
name on it yeah they got divorced but I
suppose your name wrong I still have no
did not I know for a fact isn't it Seb
Asst I am Sebastian anyway ah it is the
new one has improved strap materials for
greater comfort a stronger ripstop nylon
lining
improved power adapter mounting and
cable management news community you know
and you can use offer code - tech 25 to
save 10% over at Moss organizer lol
didn't have that up the whole time calm
until Christmas organisation it's truly
a great gift for the OCD nerds in your
life alright so we've also got see sonic
has a sponsor to tell you Wow since when
to see sonic sponsor the wind show and
they are featuring the where'd it go
it's the power supply that we had over
here you have the power supply I have
nothing oh wait a second
do you have it is this it no that's not
it
okay well I guess I can't really I guess
I can't really show it um so they see
sonic Prime ultra tight oh I know what
we're supposed to do I'm supposed to
click this
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da like mean there
it is can we use cookies yes yes yes use
your cookies yes you can have all the
cookies the prime mulcher titanium it's
a d-plus titanium and it has a 12 year
warranty which is ridiculous
it's fully modular it's super quiet
how many builds would you use over 12
years is that 2 3 pcs that's like 3 to 4
for me anyway like every every three
years I'd say it's pretty reasonable to
refresh your computer maybe not the
whole thing well exactly you're keeping
the power supplies like graphics for
sure there would be no reason to upgrade
this power supply that I can think of
for at least like I'm just trying to
think like 10 years ago
what was a top-of-the-line power supply
like it would still be usable today even
if it's not still top-of-the-line like I
see no reason why this couldn't be the
same thing so it's got a fluid dynamic
fan very fluid dynamic bearing fan
it's got premium hybrid fan control so
you can keep your fan noise minimal
it's got micro tolerance load regulation
whatever that means basically it means
good regulation and lambda noise level a
plus plus so that means the noise output
stays below 20 decibels during operation
pretty cool so check it out at see
Sonic's website or at Amazon at the link
below leading us to our final sponsor of
the day yes big fresh books is the super
simple to use invoicing tool that
actually does a lot more than help you
create and send slick-looking invoices
it helps you track your time with their
timesheet function manage your expenses
and keep track of who owes you one
it even has a feature that tells you
when your client looks at your invoice
for the first time the mobile app has
all the functionality of the desktop
version so you can take fresh books with
you wherever you go and if you have any
questions you can feel free to reach out
to their support staff where they will
laugh at you for not knowing how to use
their simple to you so I'm just kidding
they won't do that they will help you
know phone trees no ask
no return calls just straightforward
answers from a real human sufficient
visit fresh ebooks.com slash man and
claim your free trial today has anyone
spoken to fresh books today like it when
I do that I have no I've heard feedback
from other sponsors of ours that are
like who's that James guy what is he
doing books they seem pretty chill
someone came up from ELT accident was
like do fresh books really all right a
Chinese scientist claims to have created
the first designer babies basically this
was supposed to by Captain to fire on
the forum and it's like kind of hard to
cover this because the actual
information is a little bit spotty so he
claims that he's created two twin girls
that are resistant to HIV virus through
some kind of mutation that is more
common in Europe people of European
ancestry who are survivors of like the
bubonic plague or something like that
like it has to do with some resistance
that was built in Europe but that wasn't
built over in Asia now pretty much
everyone is mad the university that he
was currently on unpaid leave from the
scientific community at large the tech
community at large and like the the
university was unaware of the project
and its nature and is calling on
international experts to form an
independent committee to probe the
matter like people be mad so anything
else to kind of say about this well we
could talk about what actually sure
allegedly happened so the best way to
get acquainted I thought our good
starting point is actually look at a
YouTube video that the doctor whose last
name is he
which is actually kind of confusing but
he uploaded this video and he gives his
perspective on the whole thing he
doesn't call him designer babies he
thinks that this is totally ethical and
I think he makes a compelling case for
that here and he explains the process
which is this is this is fertilization
by IVF and so what they did was they
inject the father sperm into the
mother's eggs and shortly after that
they inject some proteins and they carry
out the gene surgery
using CRISPR technology which I
understand it there's enzymes are
programmed to look for particular
patterns in DNA and when they find them
they just snip that out and only that so
what they did was they they sequenced
and they did whole genome sequencing on
the I guess the cells on the on the
babies before doing the genome surgery
and after and the reason they did that
is then they can compare to see if any
genes were affected that weren't
intended to be affected and according to
this person's the doctors statement the
scientist does say that they didn't they
didn't all do anything that they didn't
intend to alter so it was a success in
that regard so if it's all true that
these children are alive now they've
been born and they will be the first
living people who have had their genes
edited if it's true dang crazy so it's
gonna be an interesting it's gonna be an
interesting couple of decades where do
you use I see you scrolling over to
other topics but where do you sit on
that I'm like oh wow
that is a pretty big question isn't it
um I think it's I am far more
comfortable with cybernetic improvements
to humans than I am with genetic
improvements to humans I think we open
ourselves up to a lot of potential
problems I mean even this one already
has problems like I believe West Nile
virus is more likely to infect these
little girls
oh that's hairy so you're you're gaining
resistance to one disease but you're
actually losing some of your resistance
to another I first they're not
consenting to that and of course they
are not consenting to that that's that's
a whole that's a whole separate issue
I'm sort of talking ten thousand foot
view right now what does it mean to
humanity now as long as it takes place
on a relatively limb
scale I I doubt that we're opening
ourselves up to mass extinction through
having you know edited all of our own
genes like I'm of an entire if we edited
an entire generations genes and then all
of a sudden something came along we made
ourselves weak against it and if
humanity is dead like I feel like that
kind of thing is very very unlikely
most of my discomfort like so right so
in small doses I actually don't see it
necessarily being a huge problem the
issue is that I broke it already the
issue is that it opens itself up to all
kinds of misuse and I don't have a ton
of inherent trust for people okay there
is nothing that I have seen in my life
that would lead me to believe that
people as a whole will take some kind of
technology and use it only or even
primarily for good are you if you take a
step back and let's say everything was
executed perfectly and maybe we're not
even considering the fact that the
alterations are inheritable by that by
that organisms next of kin
if you just answer the question is it
okay to remove conditions that are just
objectively harmful for to it to someone
like take away take away the muddying of
the fact that this may have increased
their likelihood to contracted
differences so i have to ignore that we
might not know what the hell we're doing
yeah like let's just say in a vacuum
it's like this procedure is guaranteed
to only remove something harmful
I guess your slippery slope arguments
still remain it sure does that's the
thing about a slippery slope is it
starts really high up and you actually
don't know that it was a problem until
you're face down in the mud at the
bottom so yeah right so like I said I am
far more comfortable with cybernetic
upgrades than I am with actually making
changes at a genetic level but does that
apply even if those cybernetic upgrades
were happening to an infant like a
baby's born and you put an employee you
already have that it's called a cochlear
implant you can use it to restore
hearing to an in
and that was born profoundly deaf so we
have that now the funny thing about that
is you might think as a hearing person
as someone who was who was born without
what at least some people would describe
as a disability you might think well
this is so obvious if they couldn't hear
and now they can hear then that's great
cochlear implants for all but there are
actually people out there who feel like
they've kind of had their identity
robbed from them because a cochlear
implant does not make you hear as well
as a hearing person in the installation
of a cochlear implant they have to
remove and this might be outdated
knowledge but as far as I know they have
to remove everything that was left of
any hearing capability that you had
before they perform the operation making
you certain not whole as a person
depending on how you kind of define that
and so they can end up feeling kind of
robbed of a community because if they
hadn't had it they would have been part
of the deaf community versus if they
just hadn't been born Beth then they
would have been part of the hearing
community but they're kind of in this
weird limbo and you could make objective
arguments all day for why their position
is wrong but it doesn't ultimately
matter because if we remove the
emotional component of being human then
why even bother Wow
I have a perfect emotional segue for
that we got a hundred or super chat over
here we should read out thank you in
advance
hey thanks for the everything during my
job I hope you remember me shoe 125
probably not lul still never got
floatplane working ah thanks for the
every during major is this a person from
the fancy X for having my job I don't
know
or if someone just watches ltte at work
[Laughter]
Jules asked how was the cake I actually
didn't I did how was the king very tall
it was like how wide do I have to make
this piece to get a regular like I'm
of cake here it was like I'm just gonna
go regular width it's like was it yummy
it was like an almond style cake right
something is that marzipan I don't know
was it good yeah there's lots of custard
in it which time although lots of many
layers it was like I had this Tiger died
take a photo of this whatever it was
good thanks for the cake
Maykel says make a computer that is made
from chip to chip transistor and
resistors from scratch that equals
something from 1995 I think alex is
actually working on a DIY CPU at the
moment mightily hi Scott no it's like
there's like a guide you can follow like
he doesn't have to invent it or anything
so yeah we have Rick from Rick and Morty
working in oh yeah you just over there
making a capacitor defibrillator wait
wait space-time space-time when you're
time-traveling and someone's on a
cardiac arrest alright one more topic
the most important one of this week
that's what you're picking Starbucks
Starbucks says it's gonna block porn on
its public Wi-Fi next year so if you
want a jerk it in Starbucks you're gonna
have to do it sometime between now and
December 31st so you don't have to I
vote for Christmas Day because it'll
probably be pretty empty really much
else to say about a little bit actually
so there was there late to the party
just some people were actually kind of
mad because Starbucks took up to two
years longer than other chains like
subway and chick-fil-a and McDonald's
who have already implemented this and
there's actually a petition that
circulated I got twenty six thousand
signatures that was circulated by an
organization who fights with these this
kind of stuff and they they have some
pretty compelling arguments of why this
should happen sooner so they say that it
helps teens and underaged people like
when they don't have these filters at
Starbucks these kids can go to these
public Wi-Fi places and and watch stuff
that the other ways couldn't watch at
home into their home Wi-Fi and that also
applies to sex offenders who by law
can't visit certain sites right but
apparently they can when they go to
these public spaces
so actually there is one more topic
YouTube is bringing down the paywall on
their YouTube originals apparently they
have determined that the ad supported
model that has sustained YouTube
basically since its acquisition from by
Google anyway is the way to go
so YouTube originals are still getting
funded but they will become free and ad
supported rather than only being
available to YouTube premium members
personally I think this is a good move I
mean from my part anyway YouTube premium
is already a compelling enough value add
alright compelling enough value just
based on that I don't have to watch ads
like and I'm gonna watch much YouTube
like half the time I'm blocking the ad
on my own video with my premium stupid
premium membership the fact that like
YouTube our Google Play Music is
included like it's already a great value
I don't really understand why we need
these originals like original series but
what this will probably mean is that
YouTube is gonna be cutting back the
kind of funding that they had put aside
for YouTube originals like it seems to
me that they've just done some Rica
jiggering of the math on the back end
for how this YouTube premium money is
getting distributed and they've gone
well we're spending a lot on these
originals but they don't seem to be
actually driving subscriptions so what
if we just kind of cut that entire part
of the equation and like we can still do
YouTube originals and that's like cool
but let's just make it accessible to
everyone and then maybe it'll get a lot
more views and then like maybe people
will care more about it and we can go
like mainstream with this whole thing
and then there's like merch and
licensing and like other platforms that
we can license it to and like they could
take a more conventional approach to too
high production value car and that's
right
that's right because even though it was
a ton of money hundreds of millions of
dollars that's still a drop in the
bucket compared to the tens of billions
that other services like Netflix and
Amazon Prime and who are fighting so and
no offense to ourselves and other
youtubers but like quite frankly I would
I would pick you know the actual
experienced Hollywood production people
that Netflix works with over like
youtubers for these times well the thing
is you lose the spirit of what you like
about the youtuber like I love these
I didn't Michael if you're watching I
didn't really care for their mind frame
that I watched and the reason even
though the concepts are cool is because
it's no longer Vsauce because the cool
thing you like about these sauces
Michael's cool entrance and like it's
just one camera and he sets it up in a
weird location in this house in a weird
way and then suddenly I just feel like
I'm watching Discovery Channel or
something with these epic sweeps all
booms and it's like it doesn't have the
same character yeah so this is gonna
start it's actually starting 2019 but it
won't fully affect all originals until
2020 it's probably some contract stuff
going on there so some of the originals
will be free to watch with ads soon and
others you'll have to wait a little
while speaking of things that you'll
have to wait a little while for the
lands show your your fixed next week
because we are done for the day
it's out Wow it is 20 after 6 we are
super done for the day
we will see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel but
learn chaps like hey Vsauce Michael here
I need some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
