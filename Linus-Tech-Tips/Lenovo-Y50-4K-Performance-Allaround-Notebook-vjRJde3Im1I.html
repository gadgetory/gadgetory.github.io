products when I know the Internet has a
massive raging hard-on for them if I
like it then I'm not telling anyone
anything they don't already know and if
I don't like it then I get to deal with
a bunch of vitriol just for having a
contrary opinion not worth it
I don't need a few video views that
badly that's actually why I've never
reviewed the audio technica ath em
fifties I have a pair they're good for
the money
but they don't blow me away or anything
so that along with not having a contact
for review samples is actually the
reason that I hadn't planned on
reviewing the Lenovo y50 up until now I
thought everyone knew about it and loved
it already
until I tweeted that I was looking into
it and someone said Lenovo does cases
what I was like no so I resolved to
double my efforts to get one and here it
is so let's get this show on the road
the flash voyager gtx USB 3 drive from
corsair provides SSD like performance
and fits comfortably in your pocket
click now to learn more
lenovo classifies the y50 as a gaming
essentials model and honestly i would
agree with that if it wasn't so darn
good at everything else
but let's back up for a second we'll
start with a physical tour the top has a
striking brushed finish that manages to
be clean and professional while hinting
at the horsepower underneath and the
bottom looks the same
adorned only by a subwoofer for the
shockingly good JBL designed audio
system as well as a large air intake the
front has the usual indicator LEDs for
power and whatnot the right side has a
Kensington lock a USB 2 port and SD
reader a headset jack and a spit of
audio output then the left side has 2
USB 3 ports an HDMI output that I wish
was DisplayPort a Gigabit Ethernet port
and a reversible power jack back to how
to categorize this notebook though it's
not just for gamers it's more of a
sensible option for pretty much anyone
who doesn't mind the size kind of thing
if that was a category even though it is
a bit on the big side with sizable
bezels around the screen I feel like it
compensates by weighing only 5.3 pounds
and being a mere point nine inches thick
both very reasonable values for a 15.6
inch notebook and it also helps me
forgive the size to see lenovo use that
space too
put this bad boy with one of the best
keyboards that I've ever used on a
gaming notebook it's got a striking red
backlight and Matt wrist rest commit
snow cardinal sins like short shifts or
backspace keys includes a full number
pad for productivity has correctly laid
out arrow keys and most importantly the
tactile feedback is excellent my two
complaints are that it lacks mute and
media control keys even with a function
modifier and the tops of the key caps
are a little bit slippery out of the box
but that didn't prevent me from being at
full speed within two minutes of using
it although given how many business
notebooks Lenovo makes I guess it
shouldn't surprise me that much that
they know a thing or two about how to
make a keyboard it's just a shame that
this didn't carry over to the touch pad
to be clear there are some really good
things about it it almost never
misinterprets multi-touch and windows 8
gestures a big problem with my XPS that
forced me to disable them all the
positioning is perfect allowing me to
easily type without touching it and
whenever I intentionally brush my palms
on it to test it it did a great job of
palm rejection tracking in the surface
finish are alright but even with all
those positives in mind I wasn't a huge
fan of using the mousepad
two-handed with clicks often registering
as downward movements and the overall
fit and finished left a fair bit to be
desired for me with some noticeable
rattling when using tap to click and the
click pad functionality on the rest of
the pad being extremely inconsistent
with the middle requiring a little bit
of force and the edges much more I guess
it makes sense that there would have to
be at least a few compromises like this
on a notebook that costs anywhere from
around a thousand to around $1,500 and
delivers these kinds of specs though the
$1,300 model on Amazon has a core i7 2.4
gigahertz quad core 16 gigs of ram a gtx
860m with 2 gigs around the 256 gig SSD
and last but not least a 4k IPS display
I mean think about that
for less than the cost of buying a 4k
IPS monitor you can buy an entire
notebook with one attached to it the
world is a funny place speaking of the
4k display what a great value my unit
even has a touch screen although a quick
search on Newegg didn't reveal an option
available
like that so your mileage may vary but
back to how it looks it's beautiful
no it's not perfect mine has some
noticeable backlight bleed especially
along the left edge but man that kind of
pixel density is amazing even with my
nose 10 centimeters from the screen
correctly scaled text looks astoundingly
crisp viewing angles are easily suitable
for sitting and watching 4k videos with
a group of friends with no one getting a
crappy view or lousy colors and doing my
usual drag windows around and see how
noticeable motion blur is quick and
dirty test didn't reveal anything
unexpected given that we know it won't
have the same speed and responsiveness
of a TN panel now I've seen a lot of
people online being very harshly
critical of Lenovo's use of a 48 Hertz
display here instead of a 60 Hertz one
but to be honest it doesn't bother me
that much 30 Hertz is unbearable but
I've used 50 Hertz by accident on my
computer before and while things do feel
a little bit off and I'll notice and
I'll change it back eventually
it never really bothers me in 2d work
and frankly in games your IPS panels
slow response time and gtx 860m
are going to likely be bigger
performance bottlenecks than the maximum
refresh rate of your screen being 48
Hertz especially if you're gaming at 4k
which leads us nicely into the overall
gaming experience which isn't as
seamless as I think it needs to be while
more casual games like dirt3 were
actually playable at 4k on high settings
with minimum frame rates around 30 fps
hardcore titles are not going to run at
that resolution which wouldn't be a
problem except that due to the way
intel's driver handles scaling on this
display when you're running a native
resolution DirectX 11 games the ones
that I tried anyway will run at the
resolution you set like 1080p in the
middle of the screen with black bars
around them there are a couple of
workarounds but the first is to force
the lower fidelity DirectX 9 render path
which can involve weird config file or
registry edits so not everyone will want
to do that and the second involves
changing the desktop resolution which
will likely require you to change the
text scaling which by default is set to
the maximum
then we'll push a bunch of UI elements
off-screen so then in order to do that
you have to log o to Windows and log
back in every time you want to run in
DirectX 11 game at 1080p I hope a driver
can fix this but given that the Nvidia
control panel doesn't control display
scaling in dual graphics mode and the
most recent Intel graphics drivers
validated for this model are over three
months old I don't know if I would hold
my breath for that fix but yeah and
there are some other issues too like the
GPU power limit throttling that occurs
sometimes when gaming at high settings
on battery causing large frame rate
fluctuations even when I set the Nvidia
control panel to prefer maximum
performance for the GPU it's not all bad
or anything though
the battery lasts for over an hour
straight gaming and about 4 hours doing
other things an acceptable result and
the system runs really cool with neither
the CPU nor the GPU reaching over 70
degrees even after an hour straight
gaming and only the top of the keyboard
between the E and Y keys developing a
bit of a toasty hotspot something that
really didn't affect me much the problem
is I just don't think these things are
enough to turn my conclusion into a
super positive one the Y 50 at least the
4k model just isn't easy for me to
recommend as a gaming notebook
honestly it's issues most of which are
relating to the cutting edge screen are
not Lenovo's fault it's hardware or
driver limitations that are beyond their
control but for the customer spending
his or her own real money on the product
that says lenovo on it i don't know how
much that matters with that said while
gaming on the y50 had problems other
than the frustrating touchpad it was a
pleasure to use in every other way so I
still have no problem recommending it as
a powerful CUDA capable productivity and
multimedia notebook it delivers
astounding specs great build quality a
fantastic keyboard a rich content
enjoyment experience basic gaming
functionality and to my eyes beautiful
stealthy looks and it does it all at a
price that real people can afford so I
have to give kudos to Lenovo for all of
that but as a gamer I feel like option
one is settling for the 1080p model with
the much
less beautiful screen and option 2 is
waiting for either a driver fix for this
one or a next-generation product to iron
out the wrinkles which is IMO not a
terrible choice because once they fix
that stuff this baby is going to be
really hard to beat speaking of hard to
beat audible calms massive selection of
