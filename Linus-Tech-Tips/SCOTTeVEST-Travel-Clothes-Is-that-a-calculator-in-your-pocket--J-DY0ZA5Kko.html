click this video for the promise of
seeing me sporting some fashionable and
practical Underpants and for those of
you who didn't want to see any of that
biz I guess all I can really say is
sorry because it's definitely coming
later but a review of an outfit has to
start with first impressions and as
shallow as this may be first impressions
are normally of the outer layer of one's
clothing not what's under them
sorry tinder users
Kingston kc3 ten series business grade
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them so
what's right in the name of the maker of
these clothes I picked out for my trip
to Asia Scott Eve s2 their specialty is
vests so I guess that's where we'll
begin now last time around I tried the
travel vest for men with it's stunning
cargo capacity that allowed me to carry
everything you see on this table here in
the vest alone this time I wanted
something that wouldn't make me look
quite so boxy but would still allow me
to carry a reasonable amount of stuff in
it so I settled on the featherweight
vest for men for which a typical loadout
might look a little something like this
my left breast pocket contains a phone
or other portable electronic do that
along with a USB DAC and a pin the
velcro secured sub pocket and the
matching cable for that in the open
pocket in the right breast I could keep
a couple of sticks of RAM in case I need
to upgrade a PC unexpectedly and you
might laugh but that actually did end up
happening while I was over there on the
outside are a mere two additional
pockets with the left one being a pretty
standard fare zipper pocket with lots of
space in it may be good for storing some
extra napkins some headphones or a
gigantic microbe or something along
those lines on the right containing an
elastic band to keep your water bottle
upright and a carabiner button to a loop
inside for something you really don't
want to lose like a key cap puller for
example opening it up on the left side
we've got a pen holders some headphone
wire management stuff that I just never
use because it's a pain when you go to
take the thing off and it pulls on your
ears or worse yet you forget it's in
there and wash your earphones as well as
another zipper with an RFID blocking
wallet pocket with a separate mesh
pocket for some walking-around money and
an ID pocket that is probably more
useful for like your you know
love membership that you keep in your
vest as opposed to your driver's license
that no one is ever gonna let you show
them through a mesh pocket in your
jacket and that you don't want to
accidentally you know leave in your
other vest in case you need it in an
emergency on the right side of the
inside is another pen spot I chose to
put a sharpie there so I'll never be
caught without one and an iPad pocket
which you can use for any large object
or electronic device if you're into that
sort of thing
overall the vest struck a good balance
between looks wearability and cargo
capacity for me or at least it would
have if I hadn't gone to Southeast Asia
with it it was too hot for a vest the
vast majority of the time so the black
hidden cargo pants 2.0 actually got more
mileage especially on my travel days
when I knew I'd be in air-conditioning
most of the time like the vest they've
got a nano coating that in theory keeps
spills from making them appear wet and
from staining and in practice actually
worked really well on baby food but they
otherwise bear very little resemblance
to the vest they look just like pants in
fact aside from the magnetic clasps on
the two fairly standard rear pockets
sure they're comfortable but they're
about the most boring looking pants ever
from the outside but as usual there's
more to them than meets the eye without
resorting to zipper pockets the hidden
cargoes are about as pickpocket proof as
possible since a potential thief would
have to be about elbow deep in your biz
before he or she would be able to reach
anything potentially valuable so on each
side there are they claim three but I'll
call it two in a quarter pockets a
standard depth normal one for like
pocket change and your keys and I don't
know maybe a pocket calculator never
leave home without one then a much
deeper one like all the way down to here
that's kind of split at the bottom so in
theory you can separate things down
there but in practice it's only really
useful as one ginormous pocket on each
side so throughout my travels I usually
kept my passport and/or travel documents
in one side and my cellphone the only
valuable thing I really carried with me
in the other one which leads us finally
to the grand finale the travel boxers
they're just like regular bought
SURS except they cost thrice as much oh
and they have some cool features that
yours probably don't so for starters
they're made of an extremely breezy mesh
look how see-through that is that was
awesome for my trip and second they have
pockets are you gonna be storing a ton
of stuff in these pockets no of course
not but you can keep some emergency cash
in them and a pack of one wipe Charlies
peppermint scented butt wipes for men it
just in case you run into one of those
bathrooms in Asia that has absolutely no
toilet paper what so ever and on top of
that the package they come in is
actually a little water-resistant ziploc
bag for your valuables while you travel
which was pretty cool
at least until until it broke so I
wouldn't really rely on that necessarily
so its conclusion time while Scottevest
clothes can't do anything for your
fashion sense teryn gave the outfit I
picked out too ironic thumbs up while he
told me I looked stupid Brandon said I
looked like I was going fishing as did
Luke and Nick said I looked like the
opinion of a dad and honestly I don't
find myself wearing them that often when
I'm at home anyway because I'm a
creature of habit and throwing a pair of
pants into the weekly rotation that
isn't my urban stars from Costco will
cause me to lose track of things like
where I put my phone or my keys this
getup did help be carrying more stuff
and stay more organized on my trip so
ignoring the price I still really like
the Scottevest stuff I just wish life
was as simple I was ignoring the price
