ultra-quiet a fan with anti-vibration
silicone pins included and I'm actually
go
we have two of these so we are gonna do
an unboxing off between me and slick so
we're gonna get the timer going here and
I'm going to unbox one of them and he's
gonna unbox the other one no no not at
the same time keep your faith hand in
the camera and then we're gonna see who
can actually unbox a fan the fastest so
we're gonna use the iPhone timer so
select go ahead and hold on to that hold
on to that don't don't bother showing it
to them it's okay though they'll just
have to trust us that we're taking time
accurately they can always use their
YouTube you know timer to to see who can
unbox the found the fastest so so give
me some kind of a signal when I can
start okay oh this is harder okay okay
I've got the pins it's gonna get
everything a ring okay so you can't just
take it out of the packaging you got it
like pins all day oh okay
Diamond and slick turned off the camera
when I said time as opposed to just
turning off this table lunch so what was
my time slick my time was twenty two
point two seconds so I'm gonna do the
okay okay
I'm not suspense time guys so I'm gonna
do the proper sort of unboxing of the
fan what's cool about this one thirty
five millimeter fan as it uses one
twenty millimeter holes very neat also
you've got these silicone they call them
pins but I really think they mean is
like fan mounting doodads all right I
guess that's not really better so
basically this goes into your case and
it acts as like a rubber layer in
between the actual effects so no
vibration can be passed to the case or
the cooler or whatever else you're using
also comes with Salman's famous they
were the first ones to start doing this
if I recall correctly their famous
inline resistors so you can easily put
the fan in quiet mode just by plugging
this in
and then plugging this into a header
let's go and do a quick sound test with
the fan before we get too much further
ahead of ourselves here so I'm going to
go ahead and plug this into one of the
headers on this board that is a note
I'll just do this to make my life easier
because that way I'll know that it's a
full speed header so we can get some
idea of how quiet the fan actually is
you know zelmans fans are underrated out
there to be perfectly honest just in
terms of quiet fans almost all of our
fans don't sound stupid whereas there's
lots of other companies that do make
sort of stupid overly loud fans in them
wow that's actually outstanding and
that's without the low noise adapter
pushing a decent amount of air I mean
obviously this is very subjective this
is like sort of lionesses gut feel about
how's the fan sounds how much air it's
pushing one of the other great things
about is on the defense is they tend to
undervolt reasonably well because they
come with an under volting adapter I
wish I could isolate some of the noise
for the stupid computer that is darn
near silent there is no motor noise to
this fan whatsoever bearing in mind
notes using a sleeve bearing they do
tend to be very very quiet at the
beginning and they can get a little bit
louder over time also sleeve bearings
aren't great for horizontal
installations so you want to typically
use them where they're going to be
vertical such as on a CPU cooler whether
it's this way or this way or whatever
else on a radiator or something along
those lines so now let's take a break
and we will come back with slicks
attempt to beat my twenty two point two
second time okay hold on I got to
indicate to slick when to when to go for
it here I'm just gonna reset so remember
guys my time is twenty two point two
ready and go
he doesn't stand a chance look at him
he's already way behind does not stand a
chance see he lost the silicone things
that's only three I just got bead well
