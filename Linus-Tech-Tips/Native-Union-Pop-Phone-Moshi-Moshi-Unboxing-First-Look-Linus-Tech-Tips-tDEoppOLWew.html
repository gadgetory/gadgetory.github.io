with the iPhone and iPad it is also
compatible with any tablet or phone
basically it set handset compatible with
all devices with a star so any device
that is that supports both the headphone
and a mic from the one port will be
supported by the Moshi Moshi comes with
details in French Spanish German
whatever that is whatever that is and
Italian and English here we go
improved call comfort allows access to
phone functions by making calls this is
all true eliminates over 99% of absorbed
phone radiation starstar something
something something report available
upon request ok turns your tablet
computer into a telephone via Skype or
VoIP applications this is also true okay
has a noise reduction system pick up and
hang up button supplied with a three and
a half millimeter plug works with all
mobile devices adapters available as
accessories works with all computers USB
adapter and splitter cable available as
accessories and it has a luxurious soft
touch paint treatment and high-quality
speaker and microphone now ok as a bit
of a skeptic I originally looked at this
and I win why really why that's what I
said but I thought about it for a little
while longer and I figured it out so add
a reasonable enough price point all of a
sudden this isn't the kind of thing I
would buy for myself don't get me wrong
I would not buy this for myself but I
might buy one as a stocking stuffer
let's say you've got a little nice let's
say she's you know 12 or 13 14 15 16
until I don't know the end of time
whenever girls stop yakking on the phone
and she talks on the phone a lot well it
used to be that as soon as you hit
around 11 or 12 as a girl you gotta you
got a phone in your room and you tied up
the line endlessly and everyone got an
eyeful now 12 year olds are getting cell
phones I mean this I don't know if
you've ever like sat and talked on I
for an hour I have your ear like hurts
after it's not comfortable so that's
what this is for this is the replacement
for adding the phone in the room this
isn't the kind of thing you carry around
with you that would be ridiculous
but what you do is you use it like like
I actually had a phone that had a
receiver like this when I when I was
young and I'm probably the last
generation that will actually remember
phones that look like this but but this
this is what it's all about
so you plug that in there your phone
sits on the bed next to you and you like
you know you sit and gab and you know
touch your ankles together with your
girlfriend's you you can actually hold
it like this remember when you could
hold a phone with your shoulder and you
could you could do something else like
unbox the black version while you're
actually talking on the phone to
somebody and ya remember what she said I
remember what she said do you remember
what she said when she said that yeah I
remember that so you can actually have
your senseless meaningless conversation
while you're doing something meaningful
like I'm bossing another teller of
exactly the same product in the same
episode of - tech tips for the sink of
completeness in fact you can even talk
on your phone no you can't talk on
phones but that's what it's for
okay here's the button for the hang up
and and pick up okay it's got kind of a
Native Union logo on there it's got like
like while they were quite what do they
describe it as luxurious soft touch
paint finish so I would describe that as
a matte fingerprint-resistant finish
it's also gonna be quite scratch
resistant so I mean think about how
something like this is going to get
treated you know you're talking on the
phone on it you're you're done
yeah I'm plug in you know you check it
over on the nightstand or whatever the
case may be
that's not something like this is gonna
get treated by the intended audience
let's have a look at what the actual
range of it is so if I could actually
just get my cameraman to take one of his
hands and hold that I'm just gonna kind
of wander over here and I'm gonna show
you guys that's actually very flexible
so yeah actually you know what I'm gonna
tell you guys a funny little anecdote
it's not really to do with this I'm
pretty much done my own box
now this is the Native union moshi-moshi
comes with a couple stickers comes up a
little instruction manual which I
certainly hope you won't leave but here
here's kind of a funny anecdote along
the lines of remember when phones look
like this so my little brother had a
friend come over to my parents house
this must have been about six months ago
and he has to use the phone and my
parents are kind of Luddites they don't
they don't have technology I mean I have
to I have to spell everything out for
them they wouldn't even have a wireless
network if I didn't set it up and
maintain it for them and key in all the
password it's like they're just they're
hopeless anyway so his friend comes from
a family that you know believes in
technologies like they don't even have
call waiting like they don't have caller
ID they have nothing they have a phone
line and I'm just saying I took my mom
until about three months ago to get a
cell phone nobody in my house set of
cell phones like and like they'd they'd
leave the phone off the hook oh yeah
I'll go get that person for you they'd
forget and walk away and the phone would
be busy for like two days at a time I'm
just like I've been trying to call you
for two days how am I supposed to reach
you anyway all right totally unrelated
tangental so his friend comes over as he
used the phone and my mom says to him
yeah sure it's over there and he goes
over and he so he so he picks up the
phone this is not not like this kind of
phone but it's an actual phone like with
the receiver he picks it up he he calls
his parents he asked if you can stay the
night and he puts it back he goes and he
turns to my mom he says wow that's so
smart your phone is actually attached to
the base station so you don't lose it
and my mom just looks out and it goes
yeah that's a feature all right anyway
