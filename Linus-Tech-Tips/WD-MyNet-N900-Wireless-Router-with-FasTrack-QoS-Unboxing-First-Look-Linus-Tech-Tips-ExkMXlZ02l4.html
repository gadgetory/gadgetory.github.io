linus tech tip show where we are not
going to be unboxing for separate
routers we are actually going to be
doing one router this one this is
Western Digital's almost well no this is
their flagship brother this is the my
net n900 which is apparently about
effortless entertainment okay that's
good that's good I know what do you mean
by that and I will explain but it's a
very cryptic thing to put on the front
of the box after this entertainment I'm
putting effort into it already I have to
open the bag not effortless I'm not
entertained at all it's ridiculous false
advertising bait bait and switch bait
and switch it's what customers love to
say bait and switch whatever something's
wrong okay 450 + 450 megabit dual-band
concurrent performance which gives you
that n900 rating HD dual band router
okay got it this is the best range out
of their lineup features 123 easy setup
full 1080p and it better seven gigabit
ports this is cool why hasn't anyone
done this the home is so connected now
why does everyone make you like where I
put it I had a switch here why does
everyone make you buy their like switch
separately and give you only four ports
on your router Thank You western digital
for providing an adequate number of
ports on your high performance router
multi HD streams and the most important
thing about this router fast-track plus
so fast track class is basically w DS
proprietary qos that's quality of
service that dynamically analyzes the
traffic coming in and out of your router
looks at it and goes with it that
traffic is sort of like shaped like this
that's probably a game I'm going to
prioritize that over something else is
less important like that's torrent
traffic
actually does not rely on any manual
input from the user it does not rely on
any profiles written by WD to prioritize
certain applications which is the case
for the two lower end routers the minus
six hundred and the 750 and it also
doesn't require any updates to continue
to dynamically update itself to provide
the best quality of service it can
without any input from the user that's
what they mean by effortless and it's
not really effortless I mean I had to
take this thing out of the box and I
have to feel the plastic off the top
it's like a job I mean this is my job
but you know whatever you guys get the
point okay so let's have a look at what
WDS to say for themselves more access so
you can connect w DS my book live
storage to this with up to two USB ports
one USB 3 port cool for remote access
with their w/e to go and WD photos
applications more control the minor
dashboard okay so this is just your
their branding for controlling your
router more simplicity supports upnp and
auto configuration good okay more HD is
fast track plus very good awesome more
advanced features k we've been through
this parental controls out of sensing
antenna amplifiers right so this one has
the best range out of their range ha of
routers and you can see that they have
it positioned as being just like do
Burris in every possible way so the
velvet push button WPS set up ipv6 they
are all ready for it and as we're all
look it's dead to DLNA server so you can
actually use this as a media server on
your home network and well access your
media that you've store on your WD hard
drive that you attach to it which is a
convenient way for them to sell you more
hard drives which I don't inherently
object to because it makes the product
better so why not and it's not like
they're forcing you to it's not like
they include a hard drive with it and
you know sell it to you for more like
this one which we'll talk about later
okay all right let's have a look at the
physicality of the unit there's your
power LED your wireless LED your
internet led your WPS LED and your WPS
button who's your matte finish on the
top which has like more of a performance
pattern on it compared to the other ones
which are just solid mat and there's
your shiny outlines okay there's your
power button DC in two USB ports
seven Gigabit Ethernet ports again kudos
WD way to go way to figure out what no
one else could that like you know forty
cents an extra ethernet ports might
actually make a difference to your
customers there's your rampart so that's
your internet port there is all it has a
cooling fan that better be quiet I
really hope that's only enabled like out
of under heavy load there's your reset
switch from there's your ventilation
holes so this looks like an exhaust so
as long as you have this sound like this
or wall-mounted it does come with
flexible mounting options and you
shouldn't have any scenario trouble with
that included accessories include
include the inclusion of a technical
support and limited warranty guide we
start here guide with simple steps for
people who don't know how to set up a
router I do you know how our cable and
an Ethernet cable thank you for checking
