going to be the start of our second
round of booth showcases they have a
whole bunch of really cool stuff on demo
including like this funky music
so XOX is best known for their video
parts they need a little bit of a
switcheroo a couple generations ago
where they used to do g-force cards
where now they're focused entirely on
radeon card so they have brought their
years of experience designing and
manufacturing graphics cards as well as
the sweet coolers that go with them
sorry spike says it's a little low and
two over to the radeon side so they have
on an immense variety of different cards
including reference cards cards with
non-reference coolers overclocked
version of sup their cards so if you're
going to go with a graphics card for the
radeon side actually it's hard to make a
better choice in XFX because not only do
they build the cards incredibly well
they have one of the best warranties in
the biz because as well just to say they
got these carbs are the only things that
they do this I don't know if you guys
have seen this episode on my NCIX tech
tip channel but I actually showcase this
guy right here this is their triple
monitor stand which is capable of
mounting up to 3 24 inch monitors either
in landscape or portrait mode or
most balls to the walls eyefinity setup
that you can get without spending a
fortune on a custom solution like the
Samsung MDT series last but not least we
have a fairly new addition to axe FX is
lino so this is their pro series power
supplies they actually have power
supplies ranging from 80 plus bronze all
the way up to their limited edition 1000
watt 80 plus platinum 1001 and if you
guys are following my personal rig
upgrades on my line is tech tips channel
you'll probably already know that I'm
actually customs leaving one of those
with individually sleeved cables and
that is what I have opted to use for a
couple of reasons number one is that it
has the best efficiency on the market
and number two is their hybrid silent
fan switch all you got to do is flip
that switch and you're fed on your power
supply doesn't even turn on until you
hit about 500 Watts load which means
it's one hundred percent silent unless
you're in like a max load gaming
scenario we're here at the abhi food
where they have a variety of different
professional types of products so check
this out these are designed to basically
clip to a shirt pocket or to the inside
of a notebook or even like on your pants
pocket you can see on sporting one right
now these are meant to replace your long
bulky cables that have the potential to
you know get broken or lost more easily
these you can clip somewhere keep them
safe they're one hundred percent durable
and they're not long so that's uh that's
a dummy so that's not going to fit in
there at all but that's not really the
point the point is that it will fit in a
real one and then there's also a variety
of other things so you've got USB a to
mini as well as USB a to a micro bead
we've also got a couple other products
so this is their notebook stand which is
made out of highlight highlight thank
you which folds up like this and then
you can reassemble it
like that BAM and finally last but not
least they've got a line I've had cases
that actually uses a composite aluminum
on the back so it feels like you're
actually still holding an ipad and
they're compatible with the Smart Cover
so you just clip your smart cover on
here and then you are pretty much
completely protected as far as your iPad
goes we also have one more product here
and will charge inflation haha portable
charging station so this actually sits
here listen to hear this activates the
hub you can charge up to three devices
at one time that's 15 watts of power
cable charging of iPad iPhone Blackberry
or any other p to anything that's USB
charger awesome there you go and you
keep that in a handy little carrying
pouch here so that you don't lose
anything if you're traveling the world
all the time
cable right here
good stuff here we are at the MSI booth
where the main focus is military class 3
so the military class 3 concept
basically revolves around using the
highest quality most stable possible
components to design their cards and
their mother board so him military class
3 doesn't actually refer to someone
there are other concepts such as and
it's doesn't balance unless you have a
graphics card on here we go such as
their twin foes or three coolers so
right here we have their gtx 580
although they do have next generation
products coming with their custom
coolers so the advantage of a twin frozr
cooler is that rather than a reference
design which will usually load around 75
to 80 degrees twin frozr coolers can
keep even high-end graphics cards at
around 55 degrees under load so while
you do have a little bit more exhaustive
heat in your system you get
significantly better temperatures on
your graphics card which is great if
you're going to overclock your video
card on the motherboard side msi has a
whole lineup of products including
everything from basic g41 lga775 legacy
stuff all the way up to the very latest
LGA 2011 and LGA 1155 motherboard
platform so there haha 77 motherboard is
actually the main focus of the booth
here today and it's a feature called OC
genie now I've demoed OC genie on my
channels before but I'm going to
summarize it really quick for you o see
Jeanie actually overclock some tunes
full system for optimal performance with
the push of one button and what's really
neat about the new OC Genie on z77 is
the fact that you can customize your OC
Genie profile so say for example if you
were assistant builder like NCIX you can
design a system to low CG need to be
even more aggressive on that particular
system you give it to the end user and
you say hey you want to overclock your
system to the max just press this button
and it's already also completely set up
for you you want to turn off the
overclock you want to save a little bit
on the power consumption whatever else
press the button turn it off no big deal
will be fun there z77 a GD 65 which in
my experience is actually one of the
easiest z77 words to work with in terms
of overclocking and in terms of bios
navigation with their click BIOS to
welcome to the ocz technology booth you
can see they got there ocz logo going on
here so ocz used to be mostly known for
memory products they are now no longer
involved in system memory however
they've gotten into SSDs in a big way so
this was actually my suggestion yeah i'm
going to take full credit for it i'm
getting like the stink eye over there
but was totally my idea my suggestion
was that in order to demo the value of
an SSD they bring two identical systems
and we're not even talking high
performance systems i mean these are
Dells but it's not a custom NCIX pc by
any stretch of the imagination no matter
what kind of a pc you're using whether
it's a netbook or an extreme gaming
machine you will see a huge benefit from
an SSD now you can do the usual boot up
demo but I think we've all seen that
before what I want to focus on is the
general responsiveness of a
using an SSD so you guys at this time
don't know which of these systems has a
regular laptop hard drive and which of
them has an SSD but I bet you know now
look how long it takes to launch windows
media player versus this one bear in
mind guys too these are fresh installs
on these machines with nothing running
in the background okay that one was
pretty close let's go find something
else that hasn't been opened before Oh
windows media center that's a good one
the more you load up these machines with
various applications and antivirus
running in the background and all that
kind of nonsense the more pronounced
this difference is going to become and
I'm going to have to find a way to keep
talking here while we wait for this hard
drive machine to finally launch Windows
Media Center these are two brand new
machines i have not tampered with them
in any way we're not even talking
Photoshop we're not talking complicated
applications windows media center takes
like five times longer to launch on a
hard drive then it does on an SSD so if
you guys didn't already know yes this is
the one with the ocz vertex 4 and if you
do happen to attend the show you can get
one for only one 2799 this is the
highest performing SSD on the market it
is pretty much right up there tied for
that performance crown right now and at
this price it is the best performance
per dollar per gig that you can buy
welcome to the PS vita booth here at the
NCAA
this is actually my first time hands-on
with the PSP so it uses a knife their
feet by 540 for screen that is almost
1080p so it's pretty darn close this is
their full replacement for the PSP so it
is their latest generation handheld
gaming platform and I got to say even
launch titles look absolutely fantastic
it has dual analog sticks which means
that you can you can play your games the
way you're accustomed to whether it's
moving with the left and camera with the
right or whether the game dev screws up
and doesn't do it that way you will be
able to operate your games the way that
you're accustomed you've also got a
d-pad as well as your full PlayStation
controls and based on help complete the
control set is on here I wouldn't be
that surprised if Sony decided to you
know make ps1 games or something
available on an arcade in the past cuz i
can tell you these graphics are more
comfortable to ps2 then send them to ps1
that's for sure in terms of the overall
build quality it's not a nice nice
overall feel to it without being too
heavy you've got eleanor buttons here so
you don't have quite as many folder
button sighs you might be used to on a
sony product however this is pretty cool
it has a touchpad on the back which the
game devs are free to use in any way
they want so you can program it to be
like r2 r3 l2 l3 for example in soccer
you can aim where you want to do a
free-kick at the goal according to where
you press on the back pad so there's all
kinds of neat stuff like that let's just
have a look have words the other
golf games going on here so let's press
X to take the shot yeah yeah okay I
currently I didn't take the shot
okay I'm taking that shot there we go
sorry I'm not much of a console by here
guys I get confused easily oh it's right
in the water excellent so that pretty
much wraps up this round two of vendor
booths don't forget to check us out at
the NCIX tech fair and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus and NCI executives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
