yes more exciting than the holiday USB
more exciting than the gift card this is
the Nvidia 3d vision 2 wireless glasses
or the Nvidia 3d vision 2 wireless
glasses kit so I'm going to unbox both
of them and explain the subtle
difference between the two kits but not
without wearing my Nvidia 3d vision one
glasses so you can see the boxes oh that
just came apart but boxes look quite
similar and the products are quite
similar in terms of their functionality
but we see a couple of huge upgrades
that have to do with a few specific
things so one specific thing is the
comfort level Nvidia claims and I have
not yet witness to these glasses in
person yet at this time up till now
Nvidia is claim is that they are
significantly more comfortable
especially for those who already wear
glasses so we will put that to the test
and videos claim also is that light
boost technology for which you need a
supported monitor see light boost
monitored hmm
light blue stereo gives you up to two
times the 3d brightness with supported
monitor so here we have a VG two seven
eight which I will be unboxing later but
not at this time and actually those are
those are the biggest oh the last thing
yes what you may have noticed about
about the VG 278 is the fact that it is
a large monitor it is a 27-inch monitor
and in videos claim once again it's a
claim because I've not yet verified it
about the 3d vision two glasses is that
they will be far more suitable for large
format panels due to the much larger
actual lenses so you'll be able to take
in more and deliver a more immersive
gaming experience by having those larger
frames and to have less sort of thick
frame action going on with the
your field of view so I'm just taking
this out just like that okay don't worry
I'll get the glasses okay so this is the
kits Q so the kits Q has the glasses
which you can plainly see I am holding
it also has AA extra nose pieces if you
have sorry about that guys battery you
know how it is so extra nose pieces for
those who have different shaped noses me
I have a fairly large nose this one
tends to work from you just find the
default one we also have a three pin
cable as well as a USB charging cable so
the three pin cable is for Quadro users
whose cards support that particular
output if you have a 3d vision ready
monitor which I definitely suggest you
use if you're a consumer then you do not
need that cable we have another charging
cable oh it looks like this is using
that I forget what this one's called but
it's a different USB cable it's okay
Slick's trying to tell me what it is but
it doesn't really matter basically it's
this one rather than a mini B and that
is for charging the glasses and then
this other one is probably actually a
USB power cable for the emitter okay
we've got a little baggie to keep your
3d vision glasses in keep them nice and
safe keep them from getting scratched
all that good stuff and go ahead and
take that out look at that it's a nice
little mesh bag there put that in there
no you put that in there and then you
put like something else in here like a
cable for example okay cool we've also
got a little user guide for the USB IR
emitter Quick Start Guide and finally
the IR emitter itself which has Berg on
the back of it some IR emission details
and settings so that's to change the
depth that's your 3d sync in which the
cable is included which wasn't included
with 3d vision v1 and there's your power
and data connection so let's test and
videos claim about larger lenses first
so I am wearing a 3d vision v1 glasses
set and I'm just going to take off this
plastic so you guys can see what these
look like and all of their their 3d
glory and I really wish it was easier to
remove this plastic
got ya okay so a couple things oh look
at that my uh okay so they've got little
rubber things here so that's presumably
to keep them from slipping and then
they've also got a rubberized finish
here on the here on the nose piece
itself don't worry I won't catch units
okay I can control the angle of this one
fairly easily so there's our rubberized
nose piece there in terms of the overall
shape of the glasses here I'm just going
to hold them side by side you can see
that they are significantly wider and
they're also wider sort of how do I
explain this yeah they're wider this way
see how these squeeze in at the end
these want the new ones the 3d vision
two glasses don't really do that so they
do have the little rubber pad here and
then that is what keeps it from slipping
rather than relying on pressure which
could make the three Division one
glasses fairly uncomfortable after a
while another thing about the 3d vision
one glasses is they have this bump here
and then this other bump here so this
bump was for the battery as well as the
wear the charging cable went and finally
for the receiver the IR receiver on the
3d vision two glasses the IR receiver is
dead smack in the middle and then these
bumps are significantly smaller even
where the charging cable is concerned so
what that means is that you're going to
be able to wear them in theory with a
headset more comfortably so you know
what I'm going to come back with a
headset I'm also going to come back with
some glasses and we're going to see how
this goes from here so here I am with
some sunglasses that I scrounged up and
I'm going to try and put my 3d vision v1
glasses over top of them so you can see
that sits pretty far away from my face
and the frames sit like within very much
within my field of vision I mean I can
see about this much above about this
much below I can see all around it very
well so hopefully the larger lenses will
have some kind of an impact ah
interesting okay you know what it does
make a difference because from the side
I don't know if you guys can tell but
for me it feels like it's closer to the
glasses that I'm already wearing the
sunglasses is it closer or is it not
okay so looks telling me is closer but
it could also be to do with the fact
that the frames are more in alignment
with the frames on these glasses because
they're they're kind of enlarged so I
don't see as much of the frames
especially at the top at the bottom I
still definitely catch the frames I can
see quite a bit below them but that
shouldn't be as big of a deal because
the bottom is more like where your
keyboard and mouse is as long as the
monitor is going to be fully and
captured which is not a word by the 3d
vision glasses and the other thing that
I wanted to check really quickly without
glasses was whether they are more
comfortable they're definitely lighter
they're much much lighter these are very
front heavy so as soon as you put them
down they look a little fall I don't
want to drop it but they're very very
front heavy these are not quite as as as
hefty right in the front on the lenses
they've used a lighter plastic on that
and then yeah they don't have nearly as
much weight to the model I gotta say
wearing them I still do feel like I'm
wearing swim swim goggles a little bit
here finally the last test that I wanted
to perform was whether I can actually
wear a headset over top of them and the
answers that I can it's not perfect
there's a bit of a gap here but that
sort of seems like the price to pay for
stereoscopic 3d where it's going to show
you guys with the 3d vision one glasses
what I had to do in order to wear a
headset on them oh you know what this
headset actually works really well with
the 3d glasses in general so maybe it's
a bad example but you guys can kind of
see how it works you can see the new
glasses I think I've modelled them
enough for you at this point and thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
3d vision 2 glasses don't forget you can
either buy them as part of a kit if you
have an emitter or you can buy
supplementary glasses so it's 149 for
the kit 99 for the supplementary glasses
and if you already have an emitter from
3d vision 1 you only have to buy the new
glasses you do not have to buy a whole
new kit and then I think that pretty
much covers and thank you for checking
