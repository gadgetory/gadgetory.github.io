amplify this is what they're calling
okay now this is a whole home router
1000 okay so what is a whole home router
what they're saying is that for a large
home this is going to provide the most
wireless coverage compared to pretty
much anything else that you can get and
how are they achieving this well dealing
with their patented sector eyes dantana
design for superior smart beam
performance is basically and this is
their summary not mine but what they're
basically doing is they're detecting
exactly a where your wireless devices
are and they are beaming bandwidth
directly to them okay so my
understanding of this is the router
actually adapts where it is delivering
the strongest signals by focusing the
wireless antenna at your devices rather
than just having kind of that general
sort of ho-hum coverage it is sending
focused signals to each of your wireless
devices in order to get you what is
essentially just greater range okay so
here we go here's where they help you
choose the right product for you so all
of these products are good for ipv6
technology with n300 being better for
extended wireless for larger homes or
multiple floors and an +300 being better
for USB sharePort for sharing devices
and n plus 300 dual-band being better
for HD video gaming and Skype calls and
then finally we have amplify n plus 300
which is connectivity into virtually
every corner of your home and even
outdoors they have a little one there so
what is it what are they wanting about
the cat I don't see it hold on let's see
if I can find it
yes haha here we go maximum wireless
signal rate derived from OEE standard at
802.11 specifications actual data
throughput may vary including volume of
networking traffic building materials
and construction network overhead all
that kind of interesting stuff ok well
here we go saint green while this may
look like your average product is not
this is a d-link green product which is
good for your wallet as it is for the
environment the dir 645 is designed to
conserve energy protect our environment
from harmful substances and reduce waste
by using recyclable packaging
interesting that's good I always
appreciate that recyclable packaging is
actually really important a whole lot of
packaging ends up in landfills and it's
totally unnecessary because the entire
purpose of this box is to get you to buy
it and then to not exist anymore ah here
here's a little diagram so you can see
what their patented sector is the
antenna design is kind of going to look
like so why don't we get this thing
opened up and have a look at the device
itself so start here so read this before
installing this we're here to help start
here put this in your computer in order
to get going GPL code statement ok cool
I've got an Ethernet cable we've got a
power brick aha
stop insert CD and run wizard first so
this is the strangest shaped router that
I have yet to see but I knew that
already before I opened it Oh use of
this device may make your wireless
connection vulnerable to unauthorized I
saw basically it's telling you to enable
a password on your wireless network
which is very important because people
can even do things like commit cyber
crimes on your wireless network which
can be traceable back to well your
account with your internet service
provider which is bad for a number of
reasons
ok stop and search ok wow there's a lot
of warnings about stopping insert the CD
and run the wizard first so I'm thinking
that for this product you might want to
consider stopping and running the CD the
wizard on the CD first before you go any
further and to prevent overheating
remove the clear protective covers
before using
so dealing provides these clear
protective covers in order to keep the
product from being all covered by nasty
horrible fingerprints before you even
get a chance to use it
there we go go ahead and start pulling
those off so that's what we do on this
channel we unbox products which includes
removing protective films that is a very
shiny router that's about as shiny as it
gets if it weren't for the distortion
I'm sure you could see slick very
clearly right about now let's just take
that and what all do be fine on this
router so the antenna is actually in
here it is my understanding based on the
diagram okay we've got an it web
indicator LED wireless indicator LED WPS
button and a power button that's funny
you don't usually see a power button on
the front of a router very strange okay
we've got a d-link logo right about here
on the back we find 1 2 3 4 these are
gigabit ethernet ports if memory serves
yes they are 4 gigabit ports as well as
a LAN port so then we've got power in as
well as USB so USB allows you to use a
any USB storage device in order to share
files on your home network which is a
really handy feature for routers to have
that way if you have very simple file
sharing needs and you just wanna you
know I'll share a couple files simply on
your network you plug them into your
router no big deal you don't need any
additional devices finally on the bottom
we find our reset switch I was looking
for that I couldn't figure out where it
was and I think basically that's about
as far as I'm going to be able to go on
this unboxing because until I can give
you guys some concrete sort of evidence
that this provides better coverage and
you should stay tuned on the NCIX comm
channel for that to be upcoming then I
can't tell you guys whether their new
antenna technology works or not but what
I can tell you is that we haven't seen a
whole lot of advancement in terms of
antennas on home wireless routers in the
last 10 years basically we'll see like
more or like taller ones but it's all
the same basic thing so this seems like
if it
it could be a huge step forward in terms
of building better wireless networks for
your homes so I'm really looking forward
to testing it out we'll be doing that
here in the tech tips room and probably
across the parking lot if the range is
anything like what they're saying it's
going to be and I'm very very excited so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
don't forget to subscribe to Linus
technics from are unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and big things to
dealing for letting us check this thing
out I'm very curious to see how this go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
