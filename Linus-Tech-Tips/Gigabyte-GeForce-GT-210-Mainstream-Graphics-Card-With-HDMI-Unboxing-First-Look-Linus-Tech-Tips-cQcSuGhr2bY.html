look at a gigabyte geforce 210 512 Meg
video card there's one thing that
gigabyte really wants you to know about
this particular card and it is that it
supports HDMI they have a gold-plated
HDMI connector on this particular card
you can see that the whole back is
pretty much about how it has a golden
plated HDMI connector so there's your
little connector it says golden plated
then there's your supports Full HD
resolution this is a hole but all of
this stuff is all about HDMI and how
this is gold-plated then you've got main
features down here and called tiny text
something about geforce 210 supports PCI
Express 2.0 shader model 4.0 etc etc
this is a DirectX 10 card so why don't
we go ahead and get this open the
DirectX 10 functionality is not
particularly important for a card like
this this is not really a gaming card it
is far more valid or invalid it's far
more relevant as a more like a media
card so if you were building a media
center and you wanted some kind of
dedicated GPU if you want to offload
some of the processing for HD video off
to the GPU this would be a perfect fit
so you can see it comes with a low
profile bracket which is labeled DVI and
HDMI there it is comes with a driver
disk so don't use that download the
latest Nvidia comm then it comes with a
user's manual okay so the user's manual
shows you the board layout it shows you
okay so we'll we'll see this in a minute
but it looks like it has a VGA connector
as well which you can actually remove if
you're using it in a low profile case
shows you how to connect HDMI and
install the software a bunch of
different languages thank you so much
and then in here on a little piece of
foam in an anti-static bag you have the
geforce 210 512 Meg video card so if I
could just get this Wow look how long
this piece of tape is okay here we go
it came off excellent so the layout of
the card is fairly straightforward
you've got your standard heatsink which
is actually pretty nice this is an
aluminum heatsink you can tell from how
light the card is overall has a little
tiny fan this I'm not too happy to see
but my suspicion is that with a low
power draw low heat output GPU like this
even if the fans not spinning very fast
you're going to get enough cooling in
order for it to function
Perley so I suspect this doesn't need to
spin very fast because when these little
fans ramp up man are they annoying so it
connects via a normal three pin header
to the video card itself there's not a
whole lot in terms of components on this
card so you can see it does use a
standard PCI Express 16x connection at
the back you do not find any additional
power needed for this particular video
card on the back of the card you can see
we've got a couple of RAM chips and then
a couple of clips right here for how the
front cooler fastens okay
then on the back we will find all of the
connectivity from the VGA connection to
the DVI connection to the much touted
gold-plated HDMI connection and so you
can see that while the other two are
actually nickel-plated okay so you can
see this is nickel-plated the HDMI
connector is gold-plated now they'll
tell you a whole bunch of marketing
spiel about how this means a better
support for HD resolutions or or
whatever else but the reality of it is
that gold-plated doesn't actually mean
that you have particularly better signal
transmission but what it does mean is
that the connector is far more durable
so if you were to unplug or plug back in
or if the cable gets wiggled Gold is a
soft and malleable metal and so even
though it's not the best conductor out
there it connects enough and because
it's so soft it ensures that you always
have a good connection so you're not
going to actually lose contact between
your cable and your connector if they're
both gold-plated it's very unlikely so
that is why a gold-plated connector is
actually important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
