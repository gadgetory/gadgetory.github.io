unboxing first look and practical test
of the sony cybershot DSC tx5 camera so
first of all let's do the boring specs
first of all second of all it is
waterproof that's not boring but it is a
speck next it is what 10.2 megapixels it
has a 4x optical zoom and a 25
millimeter wide angle lens which is 35
millimeter format okay
it comes with one battery pack but you
can also get an optional one and it
records well that's a very strange way
to advertise that well it records still
images in Full 1080p HD but it does way
more than that obviously because it's
10.2 megapixels but it actually records
video in 720p so here on the back
there's a bunch of other stuff let's
just get this open pretty much I just
want to get to the part where we
actually put it underwater so we find
first of all our one-year warranty card
then we have a notes on waterproofing ok
this might actually be worth having a
look at damage caused from misuse is not
covered closing the corners properly
closing all the air out of the corners
the covers properly cleaning it after
the camera is under in near water okay
so these are all important steps to make
sure that the camera stays waterproof
then we've got a driver disc then we
have a registration offer we've got a
note son using the camera underwater
personal some kind of accessories
brochure then we have a user's manual
which is in English and French for
Canada okay then we find the actual
camera itself so we got a charger we got
our battery battery goes on the charger
just a little something like that then
we have a boy what is this I have no
idea what this is so yeah then we've got
a couple included cables I hope no one
is closing that door behind us because
then we're gonna be stuck out here I've
got one USB data cable as well as a
composite video out cable so that plugs
into the camera and then we have the
camera itself so you can see you've got
your basic specs here it is waterproof
up to ten feet
it is shockproof from five feet although
we're not going to be doing that
particular test it is dustproof I mean
you can assume anything that keeps water
out is also going to keep out dust and
then it is also freeze proof so it can
be operated down to negative ten degrees
Celsius or 14 degrees Fahrenheit it has
intelligence sweep panorama as well as
outstanding low-light performance okay
there's your 4x optical zoom has a carl
zeiss lens and optical steadyshot so it
has optical image stabilization that's
pretty cool
there's your flash and here let's see if
we can figure out how to put okay so
here we can open the bottom this way oh
this is quite tricky to remove actually
oh there we go okay so you got your your
seals around here probably somewhere the
battery goes in right here and I wish I
had an SD card because now we're not
going to be able to actually do the test
on camera but what I can do is I can
just turn it on okay turn it on
hmm so far it's not turning on that
seems like a bad sign doesn't it maybe I
put the battery in wrong no I did not so
we'll put the battery in again close it
up yeah
okay and then we're gonna turn it on
yeah there we go that time it turned on
excellent so let's see if it has any
internal memory nope no it doesn't have
internal memory oh it does have a
touchscreen I should have mentioned that
so it's got a nice big touchscreen which
actually we're even out here in direct
sunlight right now and I'm able to see
it quite easily can you see it on the
camera cameraman says no yes
so I'm not really sure exactly what he's
getting at there but yeah so we can go
through the menu we can set whatever it
is that we want to set we're I think
we're in 720p fine recording quality
right now so why don't we just do this
there that was our test it's under water
and it's still working
lens is a little dirty so I'm gonna just
kind of you know clean it like this it
is still working can you can you see
that through the
I don't know if you're gonna be able to
see that but can you see it from the top
here come look from the top so we've got
the camera in the water right now
and it is still functioning so I can go
ahead and press buttons and stuff like
that it's still telling me the memory
card is required but the touch screen is
fully operational even underwater and
I'm not having any difficulty using it
so besides not knowing how to use this
camera so hand-held twilight oh hey
here's all your little movie our picture
adjustments cool okay so you know what
what I actually think we were trying to
achieve here today we have achieved we
have tested it underwater let's make
sure it's all good okay cool so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
sony cybershot DSC tx5 waterproof camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
