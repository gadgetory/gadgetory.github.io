awesome stuff week sponsored by YouTube
this time it's awesome stuff unwrapped
with the theme of holiday gifts for
others or that you can buy for yourself
if you're into that sort of thing and
they've even got this experimental new
ad unit that allows you to buy the item
that's being featured through the video
itself crazy right anyway
Monday's focus for awesome stuff
unwrapped is right in my wheelhouse you
guessed it make up
of course there's our my series power
supplies feature premium components for
great performance with very low noise
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so I was
racking my brain for an awesome tech
gift I went you know what I'm really
tired of seeing people buy crappy
headphones for each other and when you
combine that with the fact that I've
never covered one of the Primo value
audiophile headphones out there the
Sennheiser HD 598 and the fact that they
just launched a black SE variant not to
mention that we didn't have a lot of
time to throw this video together and I
already have a fair bit of experience
with this products a very similar
predecessor and we've got ourselves a
recipe for a video so let's take a look
at today's prize filly inside the box
you'll find the headphones themselves
with a cleverly locking detachable 3
meter cord a headphone jack adapter so
you can use them with anything from your
mp3 player to your standalone headphone
amplifier and in the case of the SE a
shorter 1.2 meter cord that will likely
be preferred by folks who want to use
their new headphones with a portable
music player on that subject at 50 ohms
the HD 598 SAR a little on the high
impedance side to get the most out of
them with any but the best portable amps
but with that said I didn't find them
entirely lifeless with my Xperia z5
compact to the point where I would
entirely avoid them if you want to use
them while you're on the go sometimes
without a standalone powered amp not
that most people are going to want to
use the regular one while they're out
and about anyway I can't think of too
many outfits that would go with this
particular color scheme so I don't know
I guess it's hard for me to describe
these physically any further other than
to say that about their headphones
you'll find the 53 millimeter dynamic
drivers angled strategically towards
your ear canals in each cup surrounded
by the lure pads there are two hinges
you got your up and down and your left
and right to help the headphones fit on
a variety of head shapes better and then
between the cushioned headband and the
ear cups themselves is a regrettably
plastic but from my experience still
fairly robust size adjust mechanism
enough about those though what else will
I be comparing them against I still
don't have an ABX listening setup on
fortunately part of the reason why you
won't be see me evaluate any amps or
decks which are much more difficult to
tell from each other until that changes
so I am stuck with adjusting my
listening levels to 80 decibels with a 1
kilohertz test tone and then just
switching between headphones and giving
you guys my impressions so I went with a
higher end lower reference point in
Sennheiser's signature sound my old HD 5
v 5s and my daily driver HD 6 hundreds
and then to represent similar tier
models from other popular manufacturers
I've got the k7 xx from AKG and DT 990
pros from Bayer dynamic let's talk fit
first since nothing in my test suite
today falls into the uncomfortable
category the HD 598 has its work cut out
for it here a kgs k7 xx suspension and
leather head strap system works really
well because they're massive ear cups
allow sufficient clamping pressure to
keep most of the weight off of the top
of the head without pressure points
while both Sennheiser and Bayer dynamic
take a different approach here and
featured the lure cushioned ear cups and
cushioned pleather headbands compared to
the DT 990s I wouldn't say I like
Sennheiser's approach better but I'd
call it more of a trade-off for the
headband Sennheiser goes for a thicker
kind of you can actually hear it air
ride type system that I find doesn't
distribute the weight on my head as well
but is by no means uncomfortable and
then again on the ear cups the HD 598
use a firmer foam and a shallower the
lure that is comfortable but kind of
lacks the warm hug from a friend on my
head effect the flipside of that is that
the HD 598 keep my head and ears cooler
while I am listening so from a comfort
perspective there's really no loser here
except I would say the k7 xx's get edged
out by both the dt 9 90s and the 5 98
but with that said I can wear any of
these models for hours without that oh
goodness my head is finally free feeling
once I removed them which actually leads
to another super positive thing I
noticed here the last time I bought a
new
headphone a my HD six hundreds per
second hand from Sennheiser's open
backed audiophile lineup was the HD 5 v
5s and those things grabbed your head
like a vise out of the box and only
started fitting like a a perfectly
tailored glove after a few months the
598 on the other hand are awesome out of
the box and while I'm actually comparing
them to the 5 v 5s in terms of build
quality they're similar except that the
plastic at the hinge here which on my 5
v 5s cracked like so many others seems
to be a bit more robust let's get into
how they sound I used a light harmonic
geek out for all listening today with my
usual mix of top 40 music because that's
what I listen to and so do a lot of
people in a nutshell the HD 598 are
worth every penny of what the non SE
model is going for at the moment
depending on where you're shopping and
even at their MSRP you're not going to
be you know upset that you got ripped
off take that with a grain of salt from
me though because I'll be the first to
admit that I've always loved the
Sennheiser sound signature derisively
referred to by people who don't like it
as the Sennheiser veil because of the
way their frequency response falls off a
cliff in the high end that has the
undesired effect of reducing clarity or
sparkle in the high range but with poor
quality recordings pretty common thanks
to the loudness war of audio mastering
it makes high-frequency instruments
particularly percussion less fatiguing
to listen to which I personally prefer
by comparison the k7 xx and DT 990 pros
do a better job of retaining details in
the highs with the DTI 90s also hitting
the bass a bit harder but not to the
point where you know anything that I'm
looking at today would be a basehead
headphone either overall I think the
best way to describe the listening
experience with the HD 598 is smooth and
easy and I know those are stupid
audiophile words that don't really tell
you anything objectively but if you were
interested in objective data then
headphone comm is the place to go anyway
and honestly I don't need that to reach
the conclusion about this video compared
to almost all of the more
consumer-oriented
headphones out there even Sennheiser
zone urbanite line that did I not get a
positive review from me about a year ago
whether you go with the brown or black
edition with the same internals the HD
598 aren't going to knock your earrings
out with thumping bass but they're a
bang for the buck winner if you or
someone you know is a budding audiophile
who wants to listen to his or her music
the way it was really meant to be
listened to
