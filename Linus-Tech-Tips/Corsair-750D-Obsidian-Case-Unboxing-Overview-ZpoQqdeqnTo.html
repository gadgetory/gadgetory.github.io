more now naturally many enthusiasts
loved the Corsair 800 d because of its
over-the-top greatness and the 900 d is
kind of that plus some however I was
always a little bit more interested in
the 650d because it took some of the
over-the-topness and replaced it with
some practicality that I found kind of
refreshing the 650d was enough to fit
everything that you needed without just
being a little bit on the ridiculous
side this my friends is the 750 d having
not received a reviewers guy and i'm
opening it with sting by the way I was
saving sting sting unboxings to start
with something very special so the 750 d
is what it looks like is without being
completely ludicrous everything that
most enthusiasts could possibly want
including unlike the 650d very strong
radiator support as well as
compatibility with even excel ATX
motherboards which have somewhat gone
out of vogue that was sort of a thing
for a bit there and I'm kind of glad
that it went away because standard ATX
motherboards are just fine unless you're
going to make an excel ATX motherboard
that actually has nine PCI slots on it
for example which nobody ever did for
some reason so it uses hard foam
actually not the most robust foam I've
ever encountered so I don't know how
strongly I would be able to recommend
shipping your system across the country
once it's fully built especially if you
go crazy and add all 10 hard drives that
you can to this system and a bunch of
liquid cooling and stuff because I don't
know how how well that foam would hold
up with that said I guess we'll find out
if it arrived here in one piece because
this was shipped from Corsair all the
way to me up here in Canada so if it
arrived then at least it tells us that
is probably adequate for shipping the
case by itself the six 750 d is
use some of course there's other cases
sort of stylistic direction of having
plastic accents or protrusions or
whatever else and goes much like the
650d for a very clean aesthetic overall
so you can see the side panel here is
just plain steel with a nice large
window we've seen this before on the
350d the extremely the extremely large
window with a slightly smoked look to it
on the front panel we find I'd be what's
become a staple of the very high-end
Corsair cases this brushed aluminum
finish and like the 900 d they've gone
with a wider stance to this case and a
wider than five and a quarter inch five
and a quarter inch bay so what many
enthusiasts are doing these days is
they're not even bothering with optical
drives so what Corsairs done is they've
gone well okay
we're not going to compromise the
aesthetic of the case by having a five
and a quarter inch bay that goes from
here to here because probably most
people won't even use them but if people
really want to have a five and a quarter
inch bay this pops off and I'll show you
what it looks like once we open it up
the front here is capable of holding up
to a 280 or 240 millimeter radiator you
can see there's a removable fan filter
and two of their AF 140 L fan so these
are airflow optimized they're not quite
like the retail airflow series they
don't have the rubber grommets in the
corners the replaceable rings and the
aesthetics are a little bit uglier but
they're definitely functional fans I
personally prefer their pressure series
fans but it's hard to go wrong with
either of them so you can see here the
additional mounting holes if you wanted
to have a different fan configuration or
whatever else the case may be I always
love saying that whatever the case may
be haha I'm unboxing a case alright
let's go ahead and put this back on so
it just sits there like how does this go
on oh I see it I put this in wrong so
the fan filter goes on the inside there
and then this guy sits so you guys can
have a look at that sits in those two
little pieces right there and then clips
on up here oh I hate touching these just
because you're going to stain the
aluminum so beautiful
all right
front aisle you've got your headphone
jack microphone Jack reset button love
that nice and recessed you're not going
to be able to accidentally press that
your indicator LEDs as well as your
power button two USB three SuperSpeed
ports two USB 2.0 ports and that is
pretty much it let's move around to the
back of the case oh where we find out
yes one two three four five six seven
eight nine PCI expansion slots this is
mostly useful if you're installing
something like a dual slot graphics card
in the very bottom PCI Express 16x a lot
of a motherboard so even though there's
actually no corresponding slot on the
board here you're going to want your
rear exhaust or your rear ports to come
through at the back you've got a 120 or
140 millimeter mount at the back there's
a 140 millimeter fan mounted there by
default they do have extra room up here
on the top so you shouldn't have too
much trouble installing a radiator there
and just more random vents also in the
back so I think it's time to open this
bad boy up I'm expecting to find lots of
room for cable management due to the
wider than normal stance of this case
and I am NOT disappointed side panel
house what I'd consider to be a pretty
typical amount of flex the thing about
Corsairs cases is they're not
necessarily over built when it comes to
things like you know yes we're going to
use you know one point two millimeter
thick metal on everything it's not
really like that it's more to do with
the engineering of them once they're put
together
they're extremely solid and it's about
the features that you get in the
convenience so little things like having
over an inch of cable management space
back here for large cables like your 24
pin although if you go for something
like an RM series power supply you might
not even have to deal with that because
it's got a flat 24 pin cable you've got
lots of cable management hooks these I
love to see Corsair and NZXT are the
guys that I'd really consider to be
leading the charge when it comes to
cable management hooks on the back of
the motherboard tray guys they cost
nothing and manufacturers that implement
them are just plain being considerate of
their customers because it makes it
easier to get everything laid down flat
so you can get that back side panel back
on they're very very nice to see and
this is cool so I haven't
not a reviewers guide for this case so
I'm just kind of winging it here but
check this out
they've got built-in SSD mounts all down
the back of the case here so this is an
evolution of I guess mounting SSDs on
the back of your motherboard tray the
top of the case actually has a very
unique sort of implementation of a front
or of a top fan grille and that's this
check it out
nice little flexible magnet around the
outside so you can take it off if you
prefer the aesthetic of the open grille
or if you're not using it as an intake
and you don't want fan filters or
whatever else you can swap around your
rubber grommets according to whichever
holes you prefer to use and you can put
it right back on just like that
love it very nice so it looks like you
could install it whichever way you
wanted so I'm going to go with this way
so I can see it to my front panel all
you got to do is check that in there
clicks into place and when you eject it
it actually pops itself out with a
little tension spring mounted thing here
at the front so you can take these out
if you don't want them you can just
remove them with presumably screw or
plastic yet there they go they come
right off just like that
and that's pretty darn cool great
feature all right so I think that pretty
much does it for the back here you can
see they've done a lot of folding and
bending in order to reinforce the
motherboard tray so in spite of the very
large cutout it actually is pretty darn
solid so kudos to Corsair for coming up
with that particular idea and let's say
oh yeah there's a little bit of tool
lessness to the five and a quarter inch
bays but of course you can install
screws as well in the front we see the
support for the aforementioned 240
millimeter or 280 millimeter radiator we
can also see that if we were to remove
both of these two three by three and a
half inch or two and a half inch drive
sleds we would be able to install
another 240 millimeter radiator right
there in the bottom we also find the
accessories which I keep getting to talk
about when I do these pace unboxings
because they're just so boring zip ties
screws okay all the screws you need to
build your system in this case also on
the front we find lots of cable
management rooms so I like to see this
more cable management holes next to the
power supply and then other cable
management holes in other places so
here's
for your graphics cards your 24-pin your
whatever pin all the pins that come
through are the ones up here lots of
room to manage your cables and since I
covered most of what's interesting about
the case when we were on the other side
let's stick with ah yes more information
about radiators and I think I might have
been wrong about that front one oh yeah
two eighty or two okay at the top you
can do 360 mil or two 80 mil so you can
actually put a triple 120 millimeter
radiator in here natively or a single
280 mil right over here and it looks
like you wouldn't have to sacrifice your
five and a quarter inch bay if you were
to go that option that's actually a very
compelling option so you could actually
do 280 280 maybe 240 depending on the
clearance between the front one and the
bottom one and throw for SSDs in here no
problem truly enthusiast grade when it
comes to the supported hardware without
that ridiculous size and weight that
comes along with an 800 d or a 900 d I
could actually move this thing with a
system installed in it when we did our
overkill buyer's guide in the 900 D I
couldn't move the system on my own once
we were done with it so you've got a
filter that's removable for the power
supply intake so that's pretty
straightforward actually one of the
better built filter removal mechanisms
that I've ever seen so it actually has
like a slot that it goes into instead of
relying on being able to line it up with
weird little like you know bits of metal
or whatever else so thank you for
