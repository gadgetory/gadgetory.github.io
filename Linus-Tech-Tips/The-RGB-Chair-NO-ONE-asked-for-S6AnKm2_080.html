mechanics and medical mood lighting
research facility we firmly believe in
pushing the boundaries of RGB technology
and today you'll witness the fruit of
literally several hours of planning
behold our all-new electromagnetic
Kurganov X device the Robo chair
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise isolation and is
optimized for different liquid radiator
configurations learn more at the link
below have you ever been sitting there
in the dark admiring your RGB computer
and thought gee why doesn't my chair
also have our GB lighting
well I was and I did so I sent an email
off to cable mod and before I knew it a
massive box of LED strips arrived at the
office man I thought we were RGB crazy
then those guys were all like get on my
level anyway step one was to find a
chair the one we chose for the job was
the Vertigo 350 we hoped it's mesh
backing would allow our lighting effects
to shine through and the cool swoopy
construction would give us tons of
options for mounting our adhesive-backed
RGB strips next we needed to pop open
some packages and mock up how we thought
the RGB strips might mount on the chair
using our preferred method of mechanical
fastening generic zip ties we tried a
few different configurations finally
settling on this this process helped us
find the best routing for the strip's
around the chair without ruining the
precious adhesive which we'll need later
on and without getting a bunch of extra
wires cluttering up our build speaking
of things we'll need later on though we
hadn't quite figured out by this stage
how we were going to power the lights so
we tested the strip's the dirty way by
having an RGB tail hanging out and
connecting them directly to a
motherboard looks fantastic I mean men
could there be anything more beautiful
on this earth I don't think so
obviously though there are a few
sub-optimal things about this method for
example moving around is something
that's nice to be able to do
you don't want to risk tearing out your
motherboard if you need to spin quickly
and deal of a cat vomit situation and
being able to put the side panel on your
rig is an extra bonus so with those
things in mind we set to work cleaning
up the chair extra attention and care
was taken to be sure that the adhesive
on the cable Mod cables could hold on to
the chair while bending around it's
complex and seductive curves we used zip
ties to help out wherever possible but
in some places even those wouldn't be
able to save us if the adhesive wasn't
able to hold the strip's on learning
from the mistakes we made during the
mock up phase we upgraded the lighting
setup at this stage to ensure that even
where the Sun don't shine our chair wood
we added a sliding with the only part of
the chair left naked being the headrest
the next step was probably the most
difficult we needed to achieve Wireless
operation initially we were thinking
we'd try making our own RGB controller
with an Arduino so to control each
Channel we connected MOSFETs to the PWM
outputs allowing us to adjust the
brightness of red green and blue
independently fun fact when the RGB
strip was attached to our bench power
supply we noticed that the power drawn
was heavily color dependent we knew that
blue light has a higher energy than red
light but we were still surprised by how
big the change in power was blue
consumed five times the power of red
anyway what we were hoping to achieve
with this was to use two arduino z' one
connected to the asus r a sync port on
the motherboard that then sends data
wirelessly to a second on the chair that
syncs between the chair and the computer
unfortunately while this would have been
possible using XPS our arduino z' did
not have the wireless shields and at
this point we didn't have the time to
spend waiting on them to arrive maybe
the RGB chair will make an appearance
with this upgrade at some point in the
future
dun-dun-dun anyway we settled on cable
mods included solution for now this does
waste some of the excellent work we did
on the Arduino but it makes it simpler
to use more reliable and much easier for
our viewers at home to replicate so to
power the strip's we simply velcroed a
battery bank to the bottom of our chair
then adapted the included 12 volt output
wires to work with our cable mod
controller sure
a 23,000 milliamp hour battery bank
might seem slightly overkill but come on
man we're Linus tech tips and with this
sucker on here you'll get an estimated
50 hours of RGB chair fun in between
charges bringing us finally to the Oh
oh crap we forgot our pre-flight check
battery check connections check fat
beats check totally unnecessary shirk we
are good to go
look at that I've got one right here we
never we are never far from an I fix-it
pro tect toolkit this thing is flippin
awesome it includes the 64 bit driver
kit which is held in place by freaking
magnets I mean how cool is that it
includes their prying tools their
spongers their ESD safe tweezers their
ESD wrist strap their suction cups for
pulling screens off it includes pretty
much everything you could possibly need
to take apart and repair your
electronics because damnit you paid for
that stuff you should be allowed to fix
it and they've got tons of great guides
on the ifixit.com website that will help
you save money you can usually and this
is from my personal experience by the
tools that you would need from I fix it
in place of paying someone else to do it
one time and then you have everything
you need forever so head over to
ifixit.com slash Linus and use code
Linus at the checkout to save five bucks
on your next tool purchase of $10 or
more so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike this video then put being a
hater RGB is the future and if you like
this video hit that like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description also
down there is a link to where to wait uh
yeah merch store and the other thing
