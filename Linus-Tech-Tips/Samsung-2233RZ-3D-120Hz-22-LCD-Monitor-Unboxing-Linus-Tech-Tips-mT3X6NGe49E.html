2 3 3 RZ monitor and what's important
about this monitor 3d vision ok so this
is the 3d monitor we actually did a tech
tips on 3d vision about a million years
ago and you can check it out
here click this link if you want to
learn all about 3d vision technology so
it says right on the front it's a 22
inch monitor it is 3d ready and in order
to be 3d ready it must operate at 120
Hertz
now that has advantages for other users
as well beyond just 3d users because if
your monitor runs at 120 turns it means
that even with vsync enabled you can
still run at 120 frames per second
versus only 60 frames per second on a
traditional LCD monitor so I'm actually
opening this because we're gonna be
doing a 3d vision demo at our new store
that we're gonna be opening shortly so
we figured well we're gonna need a
monitor in order to demo 3d and right
now this is the only one that you can do
it with so first of all we have a Quick
Start Guide that's instructing you the
sad angry and happy ways that you can
put together your monitor okay so make
sure you do everything that happy way
and then we will find a driver DVD I
can't imagine why you could possibly
want to install a driver for a monitor a
flower oh this is for organizing your
cables pretty cool okay then a power
cable just your standard computer power
cable and what I thought was the quick
set-up guide clearly was not because
this is the quick set-up guide but we're
not gonna look at that today okay this
is a dual link DVI cable so the reason
you need dual link you can see all the
pins are here you need dual link for
this monitor because it runs at 60 and
80 by 1050 which normally would be fine
and you can do with single link except
that you're running twice the data rate
because you're running it twice the
frequency 120 Hertz so it's sending
information to the monitor
twice as often for fear of sounding like
a broken record okay here is the Sten it
is shiny and if I point it this way the
cameraman is gonna freak out because
you'll be able to see him he's gesturing
to me to cut that out okay here you will
find piece number two of the stand okay
so this is a pretty special looking yeah
right there
so I'm guessing this goes in here yeah
just like that
awesome okay so then let's get the
monitor and cell phone I'm assuming this
is gonna look like a fairly standard 22
inch monitor but okay well hopefully the
foam is really protecting this monitor
really well because I dropped it just is
likely to happen in shipping and so far
I don't see any obvious damage but that
won't become apparent until we actually
try to turn it on so there is the
monitor itself that is one shiny shiny
monitor so you can see it has a twenty
thousand to one dynamic contrast ratio
it is 3d vision ready as I mentioned
before and then at the back you see
about your four screw holes for the VESA
mount and here's where that flower
design seems to have come from down at
the bottom you will find two plugs one
for power one for the dual link DVI
connector that will power this bad boy
and then let's put this box down I see
how this works so this piece goes in
here and there's an arrow on okay you
know what I'm not gonna try and assemble
this real time because I'm probably just
gonna end up looking stupid but thank
you for checking out my video blog on
the 3d vision monitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
