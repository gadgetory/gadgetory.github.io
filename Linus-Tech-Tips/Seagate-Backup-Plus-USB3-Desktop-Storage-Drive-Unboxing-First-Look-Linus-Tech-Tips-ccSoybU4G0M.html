backup plus desktop drive so this is
easy backup for your digital life for PC
and Mac although they do have two
separate SKUs one specifically for PC
which happens to be this one and another
Mac one but the main difference between
those is the default formatting of the
drive as well as the included connector
so the PC oriented one comes with USB 3
and the Mac oriented one comes with
firewire 800 and USB 2 because right now
Apple and their infinite wisdom is not
supporting the USB 3 standard on the
side we see stuff that we'll see when we
open it up on the back we see stuff that
we can talk about while we're looking at
the drive because honestly with a drive
normally there's not a whole lot to talk
about however this one is a little bit
different so number one it has a fully
recyclable package which is pretty cool
has a 2-year limited warranty ok
it has him a hard drive inside so this
is a desktop edition drive which means
it's not not one of their smaller drives
that uses a two and a half inch internal
drive inside this one uses a three and a
half inch internal drive inside an
external enclosure so there we go
there's the drive itself what makes a
backup plus a backup plus one and it's
good for backing up is its hard drive
it's fast got USB 3 I'm just going to
put that right about there ok
plus is a software feature that
Seagate's from working on it actually
will allow you to easily backup even
files that aren't necessarily on your
computer so the one the example that
they're using here on the packaging
while I just started quickly get this
open is Facebook so backup plus will
allow you to quickly and easily backup
the content on your Facebook so the
pictures on your Facebook as well as
other social media sites now right now
the main one that supported is Facebook
however they're looking at even adding
support for YouTube in the future so
Seagate is going to continue to work on
the backup plus software
so that I mean honestly like who even
worries about what you do with a photo
once you've already uploaded to Facebook
in fact some of those photos probably
never even make it to your computer if
you don't back up your phone religiously
for example then you could have photos
that you've uploaded directly to
Facebook from your phone that never even
touched your computer that would be
great if you had something automatically
scraping your Facebook account and
making sure that they're getting saved
and and stored somewhere just in the
event that you lose your phone or it
gets stolen or something goes wrong with
it
you won't at least lose that media so
this is a very difficult to remove
configuration of putting plastic on the
drive that I'm sort of having a bit of a
hard time with here it come apart so
easily okay so the drug itself is pretty
run-of-the-mill if you've seen a Seagate
external hard drive you've probably seen
one that looks sort of pretty much like
this although there is something cool
about it so if you guys remember their
whole go Flex thing on their portable
drives you know what I'm gonna go grab a
little flash drive it's ok slick you can
go look at that try for a little bit log
of one so if you guys are familiar with
their go flex drives these were their
last generation notebook go flex drives
so what's cool about them is they just
have a SATA interface on the back very
simple and then you can buy any variety
of different connectors that actually
have the chipset required for
translating between in this case USB 3
and SATA built into the cable itself
rather than having it built into the
drive which walks you into a particular
standard so Seagate has taken that
concept and expanded it to the desktop
drives so you can see this is just a
SATA drive inside nothing complicated
about it this is a 2 terabyte drive
although it's compatible in a variety of
formats format sizes and this is
basically that go flex piece that
actually has the chipset has the logic
has the power that goes in is routed
through here into the this is the power
connector this is the data connector
into the drive itself which is really
cool because it allows you to basically
use these almost like godlike VHS tapes
to use sort of a dated analogy so you
want to archive thing
okay you have like your bookshelf full
of like you know dough flex units like
this you go you label them or something
you know you put a label on them
whenever this happens to be so you go
grab whichever is the most relevant one
you know project that I worked on for
okay let's say your wedding wedding
videographer or something so you put you
know projects from day text to Daisy
throw it on there you work on everything
right off the drive itself usb3 is fast
enough to do that although there are
more ideal solutions such as this one
right here which is also fully
compatible so this is a thunderbolt
docking station say thunderbolt so you
can take that and put that on there
that's even more ideal to work off of
but you'll need a Thunderbolt compatible
machine so basically yeah you just go
okay you know I want to work on this so
I want to see this project you want to
work directly off the drive whether
you're on a notebook or a desktop this
kind of thing is very very handy thing
see how many times I have to do this
before they just get bored and - no ha
ha oh right
ventilation past the ventilation in the
top active ventilate our passive
ventilation in the back so this won't
make any noise and I just another
plastic piece so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the Seagate backup
plus remember the plus part besides all
the usual features that come with these
drives is the fact that you can now
backup directly from your social media
onto an external hard drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
