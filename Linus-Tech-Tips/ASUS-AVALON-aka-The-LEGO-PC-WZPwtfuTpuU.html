2016 is brought to you by the Corsair
lapdog the gaming command center that
allows you to use a full-size Mouse and
mechanical keyboard on your couch and by
MSI so this right here in the Asus booth
is the rog Avalon one of the most
bewildering demonstrations that i've
seen even at a tradeshow probably since
project christine two and a half years
ago at CES they're taking kind of the
idea okay of these modules that you
slide into kind of a computer backplane
breaking the ATX form factor and the
constraints that it imposes on us once
and for all
but in a more realistic direction so
this right here is a finished sort of
high-end configuration of what an rog
Avalon might look like and it's got a
few key advantages so number one is that
with two simple buttons you can pull off
the right and the left side panel along
with this plexi top a very very unusual
internal layout so the motherboard is
actually right up here on the top but
conspicuously absent are any cables
other than the two for the fans for the
radiator and the two that go into the
graphics card that's plugged into a PCI
Express 16x slot over here on the side
and this is very very intentional so in
order to achieve a near cable list
design for what is probably though it's
very early stages right now probably
going to be a bare-bones system asus has
taken a normal motherboard and pretty
much completely blown it up so all of
these you know
Dogfish codename boards that i'm holding
here are pretty much what is inside the
bottom module you can see they clip
together with solid connectors whether
they're twenty four or eight pin
connectors like you would normally find
on a motherboard or slot style
connectors like you might find on say
for example a bare-bones server so the
idea behind it is that anyone can DIY
their own
bare-bones machine with this thing
whether it's thanks to the two and a
half inch hot-swap SATA cages in the
front whether its thanks to the fact
there are no obstructions when you're
trying to install a motherboard like you
would typically see on a bare-bones
computer or whether it's just for the
easy access to the memory modules here
in the top not only that but they're
saying that if this were to come to
market they would be looking at ways to
future-proof it as well in a way that
you typically can't do with a
motherboard so these right here are IO
modules that would be able to unplug and
plug into the back and they support
anything from higher performance audio
solutions to extra m dot two slots for
an additional SSD all the way up to oh I
don't know new unreleased IO connections
like say for example you know let's say
they had done this two or three years
ago and USB type-c came out of nowhere
boom you could add type C to your
machine now with all of that said I have
some serious reservations about this
concept so for one thing
Asus I love them dearly but they have
been the kings of building something
once with the idea of future-proof nests
and upgradability and then either never
delivering on upgrade modules or in the
case of things like the hyper kit or
things like those Thunderbolt II X
modules that you can theoretically plug
into almost any Asus full-size normal
motherboard the availability or the cost
is a serious concern so for things like
upgrading these modules on couple
kinetic bone even if they're cheap to
manufacture the regional office wants
their cut the distributor wants their
cut the retailer wants their cut you got
to pay shipping on the darn thing does
it even make any economic sense and
compared to a regular bare-bones
where it could already have the power
supply and the motherboard installed
where you're basically plugging in SATA
power SATA data and two connectors for
your graphics card compared to that are
we really
achieving anything better here
especially considering that the i/o is
very similar that was pointed out to me
that it supports four dimm slots not two
compared to an IT export it's very
similar to what you would see on an ITX
motherboard these are hard questions for
anyone to answer right now but I'd love
to hear from you guys in the comments is
a Seuss's product manager who is very
bullish on this idea correct or am I so
thanks once again to Corsair for
sponsoring our trip to Computex this
year you can check out the lap dog at
the link in the video description and a
shout out to msi they are showing off
they are showing off their new Aegis X
desktop as well as their GT x 1080
gaming X graphics card we've got that
linked in the video description as well
so don't miss any of our Computex
coverage by making sure you're
subscribed Alliance tech tips and I will
see you guys at the next booth or maybe
Luke will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
