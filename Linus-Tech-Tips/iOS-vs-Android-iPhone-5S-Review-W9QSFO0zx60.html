click now to learn more so why am i
holding an iPhone 5s or why have I been
using one lately you might ask great
question
since my trusty iPhone 4 Apple has
released three incremental updates to
the smartphone that served me really
well for three years so I figured as a
supposedly unbiased technology lover who
has been using Android and one flavor or
another for about a year now I owe it to
myself and to my viewers to take another
run at iOS with the iPhone 5s and see if
they've done enough to win me back
welcome to my late but hopefully
interesting iPhone 5s review as always
the iPhone experience starts with the
Box Apple's attention to detail
continues to amaze me all I had to do
was put the iphone box on the coffee
table and my toddler was immediately
drawn to it the power of great packaging
once we get past that stuff though
physically the 5s is nothing
groundbreaking the difference in weight
compared to the 4 was shocking for me
now that they've done away with the
glass back but aside from the Lightning
connector and the bottom mounted
headphone jack
the i/o and buttons pretty much haven't
moved at all and unfortunately neither
have the speakers for a company that
claims to care about audio Apple's track
record lately with poopy speakers on the
bottoms and backs of their devices
hasn't impressed me compared to other
implementations that are available the
home button hasn't moved either but the
tactile click does feel a little bit
different to me although it could just
be because my old one is worn out to the
point where it only registers clicks
like half of the time now
the size is still perfect for one-handed
operation from you which was a
refreshing change now that I can like
type with one hand but I did still find
myself frustrated by the upper left
corner placement of back buttons in many
apps and I think that's something that
will have to change if and when Apple
does release a larger iPhone to be clear
guys I'm aware of the swipe back gesture
the problem
that it doesn't work in plenty of
third-party apps so it's still an issue
for me
speaking of iOS 7 features most of them
weren't really anything new because I
still use my 4 as an mp3 player and
Apple has done really well by me here to
have given me updates for so long on a
device that compared to similar class
Android devices at the time like the
Samsung Galaxy S is equally old but
still much more functional but there
were a few things that I hadn't used
much Apple's Maps app has evolved to the
point where not only is it not totally
terrible but I've actually stopped using
Google Maps in the couple of weeks that
I've been using the iPhone 5s Google
Maps has actually not been that great
lately it started flaking out on me a
lot it can't find the local dump it
never finds the nearest location of a
chain restaurant for me anymore and it's
voice recognition for GPS navigation is
just plain not as good more on that
later Apple maps on the other hand was
world's better for me in these regards
from my use and I also like their
tastefully applied 3d effect but I do
have a couple of complaints about it I
did find that GPS data Legg dal ittle
bit behind where I actually was on the
road and I definitely miss the ability
to pan around when I'm in turn-by-turn
navigation mode to look for alternate
routes and then quickly press a button
to go back to turn-by-turn the good news
though is that like so many Google
products Google Maps is also available
on iOS now with turn-by-turn so you can
have the best of both worlds
if you really feel like it that said
it's not always quite the same
experience and heavy Google product
users like me will find little
differences at every turn so some of
them are good and some of them are bad
like for example 2-step account
validation is not as seamless on iOS and
you'll need to set up some app specific
passwords to upload to YouTube from iOS
you still need to share to YouTube
through the photo gallery versus just
uploading through the YouTube app like
you would on Android on the other hand
the YouTube app supports sorting the
comments by most recent instead of just
by most popular on iOS but I can't find
that functionality on Android maybe it's
there but I definitely couldn't find it
so there's a bunch of little differences
I noticed and there are a lot more than
that moving on to the camera a lot of
fuss got made about the iPhone 5s
Cameron how amazing in DSLR quality
it was and you know what the app is fast
and super easy to use it's pretty
awesome I mean the beauty of it is
definitely its simplicity I did miss
sometimes the bajillion options that you
get in various Android camera apps but
what I didn't miss was the fact that on
Android they hide cool features like
slo-mo or 4k recording within these like
deep difficult to mend navigate menu
systems that take a while to get to
Apple makes it simple you press the
button you swipe for the different modes
and then you press the button again to
capture it's just faster and gives you a
better chance to grab that moment while
it's happening
that said speaking of grabbing moments I
did miss HTC's Zoey shooting mode now
that I've gotten used to it it takes a
bunch of pictures and video at the same
time so it's great for uncooperative
subjects like cats and toddlers with all
that said you know the camera is ok when
you're looking for perfect testing
scenarios to show it off I think you can
make it look fantastic but at the end of
the day for me as a casual user it might
be slightly better or slightly worse
than competitors S or H but it's not
DSLR quality and it's it's alright now I
alluded to this before on the map
segment but compared to the you know
it's alright it's still a phone camera
camera Siri is not Siri is awesome from
the speed to the voice recognition
accuracy to the fact that it just plain
does more stuff like allowing some
system settings to be adjusted Apple is
so far ahead of Google right now in
terms of real world usability that I
really did find myself considering a
permanent switch back just for Siri like
basic stuff like being able to say take
me home at the end of the day and it
plotting a course for home very
satisfying love it another thing I ended
up loving was the touch base unlock if
you recognize that for what it is and
for what it's not it's not a bulletproof
security measure it is a convenient way
to sign in quickly and make purchases
without entering a password then it's a
great feature and another one that
really had me kind of teetering on the
edge there it works really well and I
went from feeling like it was gimmicky
to using it every single time i unlock
my phone within like 2 days but it's not
all completely rosy and touch land and
the touch screen actually gave me
constant headache
the 5s is known to have poorer
touchscreen accuracy compared to other
flagship smartphones but I didn't expect
it to affect me quite this much I often
miss click letters at the bottom corners
and icons along the top and not because
I'm not familiar with the Apple keyboard
but because it's just not picking things
up speaking of the Apple keyboard I do
still like it and I have missed the
multi-word correction that it does in
special cases like Mother's Day where it
goes back and fixes capital letters for
you but I also wish as a you know
longer-term Android user now that I
could change it up for something else if
I wanted I mean maybe something with
much easier click and hold access to
symbols like Swift key for example which
I guess leads pretty well into the list
of the rest of the things that I really
missed about Android while I was doing
this battery life is not as good as a
flagship Android device but I guess I
wasn't expecting it to be I am still
typically getting around 20 to 35
percent battery at the end of a workday
but that's about 15 percent less than
the one m8 and on a heavy day I did find
myself running out of battery sometimes
I find it infuriating that I can't put a
text cursor in the middle of a block of
text or even them in the middle of a
word without holding and dragging it out
something I really missed about Android
homescreen customization maybe is less
of a big deal for me than it is for
heavy widget users but not being able to
at least turn my bottom row into folders
or force apps into a particular position
on the desktop rather than waiting for
the whole thing to fill up is a real
drag the bottom right is where I like to
put the icons for my most frequently
used programs and it's the last part of
the screen that fills up even though
it's the easiest one to reach bummer the
home button and multitasking are pretty
darn good but not a replacement for a
back button a universal back that works
both within an app and for switching
back to recently used apps is something
I've always felt even before I used
Android like iOS is missing the
continued omission of a landscape mode
lock is annoying when I'm trying to
watch a movie in bed for example it's on
the iPad Apple it's been years please
just add it thank you and the quick
toggles can't be customized can't be
used to access the general settings menu
and can't be used to turn on a Wi-Fi
hotspot quickly it's something I use a
lot so that bothered me as well and if C
is something I never cared about before
but since we did that recent video about
it I've actually found myself using it
more often
I really wish Apple had that or
something equivalent and finally taking
iTunes off my computer is the first
thing I'm going to do now that I'm done
this video
what a horrible blast from the past that
was but as negative as all of that
sounded in the grand scheme of things
it's relatively minor stuff and I could
probably find matching complaints in
terms of annoyingness level on Android
to match up to pretty much all of them
but if you're still here watching this
video thank you for sticking around and
I guess it's time for the conclusion
here goes I'm not sticking with iOS not
because it's terrible
or because Tim Cook is the devil or
something I just happen to like the
bigger screen and better speakers on the
One m8 better and on top of that my
iPhone 5s is unfortunately a 16 gig
model so it doesn't hold much of that
sexy slow-mo video footage and this is
what I think at the end of the day it's
just a smart phone and doing this trial
run reinforce the belief that I already
had that with a bit of effort pretty
much anyone could fairly easily get used
to one platform or the other switching
from the One m8 made the iPhone 5s feel
like a little light toy but switching
from the 5s back to the 1:8 makes the NA
feel a bit like a clunky brick it's all
about perspective and I think that
people lack that sometimes when they get
into the whole Apple versus Android
fanboy thing speaking of perspective I
wasn't really sure how to do this
normally when cheero Power has us talked
about their stuff in our videos we are
talking about like a great deal on one
of their excellent portable battery
banks or something like that but when
they generously provided us with the
iPhone 5s that we needed to do this
review they actually wanted a shout out
not for a battery bank but rather a
Revoltech danboard figurine that
features artwork on the characters head
that is inspired
Zero's danboard themed 10,400
milliamp-hour portable battery bank that
we have featured in the past the
figurine comes with a little stand is
poseable and even includes another head
the link for where to buy one is in the
video description and I have to confess
here though mega figurines are a little
bit outside of my area of expertise so
I'd love to hear from you guys in the
comments is this kind of stuff like
totally neato or are you more likely to
geek out over being able to charge your
cell phone multiple times off of you
know a wicked battery pack like this
when you're on the go and it's okay for
enough you know to have like a cute
character for your charger and you don't
really need like lights up like that
actually this guy lights up too there's
a little switch on it and you don't
really need like like an actual action
figure of it would love to hear what you
guys think about that
I think that's pretty much it
thank you guys for watching my iPhone 5s
I switched back video here thanks to
tiro for sponsoring this episode guys
