just happy to see me actually the bottle
of water if you're going to stuff
yourself use something that it's at
least the right shape not square that's
creepy coolermaster v-series semi
modular power supplies feature 80 plus
gold efficiency and their gold guarantee
five-year warranty click now to learn
more all right so to move on from that
awkward initial joke and as expedient
manner as possible I'm gonna distract
you guys by showing you a close-up of
that SSD that I was holding up this is
the angel bird SSD to go pocket not to
be confused with the SSD to go twin that
we've checked out before it features the
same gorgeous anodized aluminium housing
the same durable full-size USB a
connector with an included cable and it
comes in your choice of colors but
unfortunately purple is not an option
this time so as long as you like blue
red silver or black then you'll be
pretty much good to go but none of those
are the important differences the big
ones are the size and the price in the
last year SSD pricing has come down a
lot so rather than paying over nine
hundred dollars for a dual 256 gig of
the physically much larger twin product
you can pick up a 512 of the pocket for
less than a dollar per gig still very
expensive compared to a mechanical hard
drive of course but not nearly as
fragile and much faster of course it's
not like hard drives and external SSDs
are the only options available though so
let's figure out how this product stacks
up against the entire competitive
landscape so representing portable USB 3
drives I've got the My Passport edge
from Western Digital - same interface
USB 3 and similar form factor but this
time a mechanical drive representing
portable Thunderbolt SSDs which do exist
even though I don't have one is a
powered Thunderbolt enclosure with an
Intel 730 series SSD Frankensteined
inside of it and finally representing a
category that only just emerged SSD
controller-based USB three drives we've
got the Corsair Voyager GTX 256 gig a
product with similar ruggedness a
slightly lower price and an even more
compact size so here's what the numbers
look like I'll label these for you so
you actually know what you're looking at
by the way our Thunderbolt enclosure
this is Thunderbolt 1 by the way it
delivers the best performance and
sequential writes and large random
writes so copying large files over the
under bolt to the drive will deliver 10
to 15 percent better performance than
our SSD to go pocket but then the tables
turn and the angel bird drive pretty
much takes over from there it's
sequential and random reads are well
over thirty percent faster and it's
native you ASP support basically a
protocol that's much more efficient for
small data transactions over USB three
lets it just wreck the other solutions
when it comes to 4k so small data random
write performance especially as we
increase the queue depth now to be clear
this type of performance is mostly not
impactful unless you're running an OS or
a database on the drive or something but
I'm not going to say no to this kind of
performance if it isn't going to cost me
extra which leads us into analysis time
if we compare to the thunderbolt
solution something that has a similar
per gigabyte cost then I guess it isn't
costing us extra so it becomes a very
obvious choice to go for the angel burn
but when we compare to something else
things get a little bit muddier a strong
argument can be made for the Voyager GTX
it's smaller and less expensive but it's
not a perfect product either my keyring
broke off making the size a bit of a
disadvantage in some ways since I'm very
likely to lose it now and it's
performance while very impressive for a
thumb drive is not as good as the SSD to
go pocket and then of course hard drives
are just so darn cheap even the My
Passport
err chosen for its similar all-metal
industrial design can be had for 65
bucks for a 500 gig model but of course
I wouldn't do that drop test on a drive
like this because hard drives are just
more fragile than SSDs now angel bird
does include some value-added extras
including 6 months of power
allows for mac' three months of bit wig
studio some music software and then some
royalty-free music that you can tinker
around with but ultimately deciding
which of these products is best for you
is probably going to come down to the
convenience and the performance
characteristics and how all that aligns
with your personal preference I do have
to say though I'm impressed with how far
angel bird has come in the last year the
pocket delivers the same immaculate
build quality as its predecessor with
incredible performance and it looks like
a winner in my book look how small it is
anyway guys thanks for watching
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you just liked it leave a comment
letting me know if you have you know
requests for future videos or anything
to say about this product would you buy
an external SSD which of these four
would you be interested in love to hear
about you from you about that also check
