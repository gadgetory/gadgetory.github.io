that there isn't a whole lot that's
designed to be upgraded about them
except for one thing that most people
probably wouldn't think of some laptops
out there can actually have their
displays upgraded so we and by we I mean
Alex ordered a replacement screen for
our Acer predator whatever this thing is
what is this the yo-yo so we can go from
1080 60 Hertz to 1080 120 Hertz also
bigger kilogram really yeah well why
don't we do just that
I fix its Manta tool kit comes with a
hundred and twelve bits including
standard ones like Phillips and flathead
but also specialty ones check it out
today at the link in the video
description so much like many of Alex's
videos these days he doesn't appear to
have done a whole ton of planning in
fact he hasn't even opened the package
for the replacement screen but you
validated that this works
um forums have said it should work forms
have said it should work okay
yeah hopefully I figure if this one
doesn't work we also have a Dell g3 and
also it should work so with this yeah
there's a couple of key things that you
need to look out for one is the actual
physical size of the display that you're
buying but there's more to it than just
oh I've got a 15.6 inch laptop I buy a
15.6 inch panel and bippity Boppity
because there's also the mounting points
of which there are many standards and
also there are a shocking number of
display interfaces for laptops so
hopefully we're gonna have some luck
today
well should we eat should we unbox this
first that's the one thing I fix it kids
don't have it i watch this will work
haha it's set on the eBay listing that
it should also work for this and some
Dell laptop so we'll see I guess I mean
especially given that back when we
reviewed the Helios 300 as I recall we
said pretty much the only issue with it
was that the screen wasn't that great
yeah pretty much
so you guys got to remember when you buy
an LCD display assembly like this it
includes the front glass the actual LCD
in the middle and also the backlight so
we should be able to address the fact
that it's 60 Hertz and the fact that the
backlight isn't particularly bright and
then this says don't touch Oh like was I
really not supposed to touch it I
figured you might so liquid middle it
while we're in there so let's just
replace the display and call that the
project but it could be just a bit
quieter it's not even allow the laptop
have you uh like googled anything about
this we need to pop these rubber duty
keys off or like what's our deal here
there we go I'm good I'm clear why are
things assembled with clips hold on hold
on well that was easier than I expected
this might be the shortest Linus and
Alex do a weird thing adventure yet
there's no way it's just that easy cool
okay so those mount points look pretty
similar that interface looks pretty darn
similar so you can check that out there
it still plenty of time for us to break
this we get some more tape to put on
there yes based on that it just slipped
out the other cool thing about this is
that there's lots of reasons why you
might want to replace the display in
your laptop other than you know being on
the lookout for a performance upgrade
like oh crap that's not the right stuff
oh shoot like for example it's a pretty
common issue to end up with an outline
of your keyboard scratched into your
glass so for 55 bucks you can get the
thing as good as new that's freaking
awesome
okay hold on we may have spoken too soon
is it a touch wider no it's the same
okay what's going on here maybe I just
didn't pay close attention to how this
came out oh I think it just shifted a
little yeah these just shifted okay so
that's fine yeah if you want to hold
that so you just want to make sure
before you screw it in these little
pieces right here to make sure those are
propped all the way through so you can
see the the frame like the brace thing
here it's not quite aligned see now it's
popped through we should end up with a
nice flush mount now so we don't even
have to put the bezel on or do what no
way that easy
dang all right so first thing we'll test
is the brightness buttons then I guess
right wait are they working it doesn't
look like it's doing anything but let's
go ahead and change it to 120 Hertz see
if it works so this is a handy dandy
little utility by toasty X called custom
resolution utility and as far as we've
been able to find it's the only one that
allows you to actually set custom
resolutions or refresh
when you have Intel integrated graphics
and an Nvidia dedicated graphics card
running in like hybrid GPU mode it's
really frustrating the Intel utility has
an interface for it you can key it in
and then from my experience anyway it
just spits out errors for the most part
yeah it just says like bandwidth not
available or something which is
ridiculous because you could even set
something lower in some cases and it'll
be like ooh maximum bandwidth exceeded
mm-hmm
Oh for crying out loud why always didn't
even warn us either I just hit restart
one eternity later quick quick get over
here it rebooted once already but it's
didn't what
that is definitely 120 Hertz smoothness
look at that isn't that beautiful it's
beautiful so we can go ahead and pull
this off oh that is a much much nicer
display than what was on here before we
should probably like fire up the game or
something then right Oh for crying out
loud
oh I managed to walk into a trap already
that okay gaming in 2018 ladies and
gentlemen so there you have it there's
not really much else to say everything
that's good about high refresh rate 120
Hertz gaming is now officially good
about this laptop and all you have to
lose is 55 Canadian roubles about a half
an hour of your time assuming that
you're totally incompetent and well
brightness adjustment which is sort of
the biggest problem but something that
if your use case is predominantly gaming
I think you still might want to consider
speaking of things to consider our
sponsor Rose wills prison s500 case
offers RGB lighting with a sleek and
unique design at an affordable price
it's got dual LED RGB ring fans that
emit more light to your internal
components that is sort of the point of
RGB fence it's got a tempered glass
panel to show off your internals not to
mention the beautiful RGB RGB is kind of
a theme here it's got a top power supply
mount and shroud to help tuck away extra
cables for easier cable management and
it's got an RGB front strip for still
more RGB check it out at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
