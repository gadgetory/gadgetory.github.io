the Titan overclocking guide
overclocking Titan is very different
from previous generation GeForce
products due to the way that GPUs boost
to is implemented compared to GPU boost
one so first let's show you the test
bench really quickly here we've got 16
gigs of muskan copperhead memory it's
kind of hiding here don't worry too much
about it a 4.4 gigahertz 3770k processor
under an H 100 we've also got a Maximus
5 formula motherboard from Asus at
GeForce GTX Titan of course we'll need
one of those and our benchmark of choice
although it's not we're not really using
it for benchmarking purposes is Crysis 2
so we're using this as our stability
test and we're using EVGA precision as
the overclocking utility now GPU boost 2
differs from GPU boost 1 in one primary
way instead of relying on GPU voltage
GPU clock speed and the power target for
the board itself GPU boost 2 relies on
the clock speed the voltage and the
temperature of the GPU because what
kills video cards in the long term what
kills a processor in the long term is
voltage and temperatures over time so if
Nvidia knows that okay well that end
user is controlling the temperature they
don't have to account for it being sort
of a worst case scenario so what we see
here in EVGA precision if we can
actually open it there we go is the
configuration that I'm using now this
graphics card right here is supposed to
deliver sort of a and 867 megahertz
boost clock however without changing
anything
because we're in a relatively cool room
this GPU was running at nearly 1
gigahertz before we even changed the
offset that's because the temperatures
were under control so I'm going to come
in here I'm going to show you how I
would overclock a Titan or any video
card using GPU boost 2 because you can
change your fan speed curve okay so come
in and have a look at what we can do
fan curve so I would start with the fan
curve and I'd say okay I am willing to
accept the noise level of a 70% fan as a
worst-case scenario so I'd take that 70%
and I'd put that up near the temperature
target that I'm going to set the fan
speed is very related to the temperature
target so I go okay yep the temperature
targets going to be 80 degrees or 85 or
90 degrees and I'm willing to tolerate
this fan speed okay now you know that
that's your worst case scenario that is
how your fan is going to ramp up so
that's going to determine your maximum
so then what you do is you go in and you
go okay well voltage wise I would just
crank it up because it doesn't really
matter because the GPU will change its
voltage as much as it wants to but it
won't go too far because the temperature
is going to hold it back before it's
going to apply more voltage to itself so
it'll actually keep voltage under
control on its own so I've just kind of
crank that up then the next step is I
would start to play around with the
power target so power target I just turn
up to the max and you can link or unlink
the temp target in the power target set
a temperature target you're comfortable
with this is where some of that
customization comes in so I could set a
fan curve that goes okay I want to keep
the fan speed low and I'm okay with
higher temperatures I understand that
that's going to make the GPU clock
itself down and lower its voltage
sometimes but that's that's a compromise
that I'm comfortable with or you can go
OK temperature target 70 degrees fan
speed set a very aggressive curve and
that way you can actually keep those
temperatures low and the GPU will fight
to stay there again by sort of ramping
up voltage and ramping up frequency as
much as it can but then backing off if
that temperature starts to go up so
playing around with the power target and
the temperature target as well as the
fan curves and the voltage is all
somewhat related
once you've set those up the way that
you want them so in my case I set a fan
curve that had it ramping up to I think
I have a temperature target of 90
degrees I'm willing to tolerate that and
I played around with the fan speeds
manually and I said okay you know what
65% is about as loud as I can tolerate
so I set that curve
then I made it much more aggressive so
it's a very gradual ramp up until then
and then once we hit that 90 degrees I'm
going to say okay fan go ahead and go
crazy to bring yourself back down here
if that's what it takes then what you
start to do is play around with the GPU
clock offset make sure you're monitoring
because you can set a GPU clock offset
of 300 megahertz but at the end of the
day if the voltage if the temperature is
being exceeded or it needs too much
voltage to get there it seeds the power
targets or whatever other limiting
factors come into play
your GPU might not actually be clocking
itself up that high so you need to make
sure that you're popping out of your
application that you're using to test
your overclock and making sure that it's
actually even running at a higher
frequency so you turn those up until you
either run into stability issues or you
notice that the GPU is not clocking any
higher then you have some options you
can turn up your fan curve so you can
have it be more aggressive and that
might allow you to attain that higher
frequency or you can go you can turn up
your voltage if the temperatures were
already under control you can go okay
let the GPU have more voltage or you can
go okay I guess that's enough for me
this is the compromise that I'm willing
to accept once you're done with your GPU
clock offset and you say okay this is
this is where I'd settled in it's either
you know got to back it off for
stability or those other factors then
you start with your memory clock offset
so the consistent performance that we
were able to get out of our Titan on an
air-cooled test bench and this is all
great news for overclockers because they
can just throw a water block on it set
the voltage to max set the frequency to
max and let the card basically overclock
itself anyway what we were able to do on
a air-cooled test bench was a consistent
clock speed on the GPU of about 1.1 6
gigahertz in a 3d application which is
running right now it's running at around
the around 95 to 100% board power when
the games actually running when we've
been in it for a while and the memory
clock of three point three four eight
gigahertz so that is at double data rate
almost six point actually it's about six
point seven gigahertz on the memory and
then one point one six gigahertz on the
GPU so the performance of this is
absolutely outstanding and even in a
game like Crysis 3 which we're running
at
extremely high settings so you can see
right here using EVGA precision
monitoring I can see what everything's
running at what my memory usages were
running at around 140 fps in Crysis 2
which is just outstanding so I hope this
has been helpful for you guys and good
luck with your overclocking endeavors
whether it's on a Titan or some other
video card that supports GPU boost 2
