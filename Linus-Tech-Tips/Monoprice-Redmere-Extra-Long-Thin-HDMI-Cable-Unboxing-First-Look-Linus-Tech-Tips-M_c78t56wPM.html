actually think is much cooler than
cameraman does this cable features red
mirror technology so if you guys have
ever seen like a 30 40 50 foot HDMI
cable in the past what you'll know about
them is they're about this thick around
and not very flexible they're just
absolutely ridiculous so what firm here
let's come over to the camera for a
second here so what professional video
guides use is typically HD SDI which has
much longer much more flexible cables
however it's got more expensive capture
cards that go with it and it's just
generally more expensive to use and
general expensive cables all that so for
6 50 60 bucks I was able to get a red
Mir HDMI cable these are directional
mind you these have actual processing
built in to the heads on either end so
that's what allows them to reach that
impressive length with only 28 AWG wire
so you can see oh oh hold on hold on
yeah obligatory iPhone size comparison
there you go so you can see how thick
the cable is it's also much lighter
weight it's a huge risk so this is from
the source TV no this is from the video
source so it's a huge risk to have some
heavy huge cable hanging off of this
HDMI port right here on the camera if we
want to capture video from it see it
puts a lot of stress on the connector
and that's extremely bad so by having a
lighter cable using this red mirror
technology
hooha then what we can do is we can
anchor this somewhere way better than
this like somewhere like say for example
here anchor this in place run it to the
HDMI port and then we can use cheaper
HDMI in order to output our video and
not worry about well expensive SDI or
causing all kinds of problems around the
set because we'll have this this cheaper
and lighter weight cable versus what we
would have otherwise had so this will
run to the other end to a video capture
machine that will have a couple of black
magic into
city pro hdmi capture cards that will go
into I don't know which of these is the
input in which is in the is the output
yet but there you go so you can see it's
labeled directionally this is to the TV
or the display device and this other end
is for the source and that way we can do
a multi camera capture live thing using
only fairly inexpensive equipment I mean
all things considered I mean these are
you know only about a hundred bucks each
and the cables about 50 bucks and well
the camera is not cheap but it is what
it is so thank you for checking out my
unboxing your first look at our read
