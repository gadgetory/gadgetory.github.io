testing my 9268 eye raid card with a
configuration that I think can make it
reach an internal bottleneck holy crow
look at that so I have taken my dual
Elmcrest configuration and I have
doubled it so I'm running for Intel SST
510 series 120 gigabyte drives in raid 0
using a 128 kilo kill bit 128 K stripe
and all of the other options that I
found to be quite optimal so here you
can actually see my results with two
drives and these are my preliminary
results with a single Drive focus please
come on focus you can focus there you go
okay so I'm running 5 tests at 4 gigs
across my 445 gig drive which is those 4
drives in raid 0 and it looks like we're
looking at about 1.5 megabytes per
second read and that seems to be hitting
an internal bottleneck on the raid card
itself and then for right you can see
the rights are just monstrous so the
rights are actually still scaling from 2
drives to 4 drives almost exactly double
so we're looking at almost 1 gigabyte
per second sequential write speeds to
these 4 intel 510 series drives so i'm
going to just wait for the rest of the
tests to finish and then i'll show you
guys the final results okay so I
finished running crystal disk mark as
well as PC mark Vantage so you can see
here the suite has finished running so
on the Left I have the 4 Drive array you
can see that random performance doesn't
scale especially on the right side quite
as well as the sequential performance on
the right I have dual drives on the
onboard controller because really the
only reason to run a third-party
controller on a p67 motherboard would be
if you want to run more than
two six gigabit per second SSD drives in
raid zero so based on testing two drives
on this controller the 92 sixty against
two drives on the onboard performance
was very similar so we're looking at
whether you would get any benefit from
going to four drives from two drives
using a third-party controller which you
would need to do because no p67
motherboard supports more than two say
two three six gigabit per second drives
in raid zero so here you've got the
crystal disk mark performance numbers
and here the PC mark Vantage numbers are
a bit of a mystery so I'll just show you
the actual scores here so hold on let me
just try and remember which is which
here we go so here's the onboard rate
where we have 66 Meg's per second and as
the oh no that's the PC mark score yeah
sixty six thousand six hundred and forty
four hard drive PC mark score whereas
with the four drive raid zero we have
fifty eight thousand five hundred and
thirty seven PC mark score all right so
the on-board raid zero with two drives
actually scores better overall than the
four drive raid 0 array but we don't
really understand why that is until we
go a little bit deeper into the results
so you can see here actually why don't I
put these side-by-side so you can
compare them more easily yeah that'll do
okay so at the bottom we have our raid
zero or rather on the Left we have our
raid zero with four drives and on the
right we have our raid zero on the
onboard controller with two drives so
you can see the four drive raid 0 array
cleanly beeps the on board to drive
array which it should so it should in
everything but video editing using
Windows Live Movie Maker and Windows
Media Center where this one destroys it
so this looks like it's actually skewing
the results overall because you can see
as you get further down adding music
application loading things like
antivirus these all score dramatically
better on the four drive raid 0 array so
I'm going to pull out one more result
here using my handy dandy mark
reader and that is going to be the two
drives on the RAID controller rather
than on the onboard so you can see that
the score is actually quite similar look
at that so it looks like our performance
doesn't scale that much with the ad in
RAID controller the LSI controller by
adding more drives so there you have it
it looks like two drives is about all
that we are able to leverage with PC
mark Vantage I mean you can see the
scores do improve a little bit this is
four drives this is two drives but
that's pretty much it so thanks guys for
checking out this video on running for
intel SSD 510 C 2 3 6 gigabit per second
drives against two drives don't forget
