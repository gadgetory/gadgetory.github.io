mail today we have our second p55 board
the p55 you d4p this is an ATX out of a
mainstream gaming platform board from
gigabyte you can see it features ultra
durable three which basically ensures
that you're gonna have good power
delivery when you're overclocking or
gaming or doing whatever it is you do
with a reasonably high-end board
now speaking of reasonably high on board
this is an 1156 board so that means it's
got support for the upcoming core i5 and
the new socket 1156 core i7 so let's get
into the accessories we've got an IDE
cable for SATA cables and then some
little package like that then we have a
Dolby home theater sticker so there's
some kind of Dolby certification going
along with this board flexible SLI
bridge
so it has SLI support then we've got an
installation guidebook for installing
your motherboard the regular users
manual and you've got a driver CD
included in the front cover of that then
you've got your i/o shield then you've
got a manual for smart six gigabytes
monitoring software then you've got a
manual for smart GPM some kind of okay
some Bluetooth cellphone okay we'll get
to that later then let's get down to the
the more interesting parts we've got the
gigabyte G 45 UD four piece so let's
pull this board out of the packaging
here and have a closer look at it so
like most piece we've got support for up
to 16 gigs of dual-channel ddr3 memory
you've got an 11 56 LGA 1156 socket and
then you've got an eight phase-- power
distribution system for the CPU itself
surrounded by these pretty cool-looking
coolers now this is a bit of a departure
from gigabytes normal color scheme in
that there's only like three colors so
we've got the dark blue PCB very
characteristic then we've got white
ports blue ports and that's about it
I've got SATA 2 you've got your power
connectors in the usual spots we've got
an IDE connector we've got a floppy
connector and here's some of the more
interesting stuff we've got support for
2 16 X cards in SLI but each of them
gets
X bandwidth so SLI or crossfire can both
plug into those things and let's have a
look at the i/o ports here so it should
have a look okay so we've got 10 USB
ports total of 10 USB ports but two of
them are these cool USB / eSATA ports
that's really neat so you can plug in
either an eSATA hard drive or a USB
device you've got firewire digital audio
a couple Ethernet ports and seven
channel audio so there it is the EP 55
sorry piece it the p55 you d4p</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
