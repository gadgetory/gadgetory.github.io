devices cameras included so what are
your solutions for keeping your camera
dry while still being able to capture
the memories that you're making in and
around water
terrons suggested buying an aquarium to
put the camera inside and shooting
downward like a glass-bottom boat but
surely there's a better way let's look
into it
cool masters Master Casemaker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours more info in the
link in the video description
let's open with a retro solution the
classic disposable waterproof camera
this Fujifilm quick snap is limited to
27 shots
needs to be developed at a photolab cost
$15 and isn't rated for depths greater
than what you'd reach while snorkeling
the advantages are that it floats making
it hard to lose and if you're using an
older smartphone the resulting digital
negatives will deliver higher quality
prints however I'm not a huge fan of the
solution for the reasons outlines let's
get into the more modern ones like this
generic dry bag for smartphones this one
is from J Tech these simple little
pouches are shaped to fit your
smartphone protecting it from splashes
and dirt and even allowing you to fully
submerge your device here is the biggest
problem with using a dry bag like this
as your waterproof solution using your
screen can be frustrating most camera
controls even the shutter button on most
phones is controlled through the touch
screen which would frequently fail to
register touches my recommendation here
is to map your shutter button to a
hardware button on your phone which as
long as you're happy with full auto
operation will allow you to not have to
fiddle with your on-screen buttons
iPhones use the volume buttons by
default and some Android phones have
dedicated buttons but if yours doesn't
there are apps that enable this
functionality this will also allow you
to press the shutter button underwater
since touchscreens do not operate well
when fully submerged the other possibly
even more frustrating issue I face when
using these dry bags was the frequent
unintentional screen presses caused by
water splashing onto the screen during
use this is just a limitation of
capacitive touchscreens so unless we
want to go back to pressure sensitive
technology it's likely you like me will
end up with zoom ins and pictures taken
that were never intended thankfully we
don't pay for film anymore and without
having to spend hours and Lightroom
tweaking at least the image quality
seems surprisingly ok but I would still
describe these dry bags as at best a
passable low budget solution if your
main goal is to keep your phone safe
from the elements which it did a great
job of and the actual usage of your
device is secondary
if however consistent usage of your
device is more
you you might want to give a waterproof
case made specifically for your model a
phone a shot in this case we picked a
lifeproof enclosure made for the galaxy
s7 called the fray this solution proved
to be much more functional since the
buttons on the case are formed to your
phone allowing use with your device's
physical buttons to be much easier the
case also did not register as many
accidental inputs making the camera with
water splashing around a much more
manageable experience I found myself
appreciating how much more comfortable
the case was to use for regular use
above water
since the form factor was much easier to
manage not to mention the advantage of
not needing to suit up your phone before
entering the pool cost-wise
this case comes in that nearly 5 times
more than a generic dry bag and it can
only be used with a smartphone model
it's made for however if you're a casual
underwater photo taker and care about
regular use of your phone while on a
trip or you spend a lot of time around
water this is probably the best option
for you now for those of you who want
something a bit more powerful action
cams like our gopro hero4 black edition
are a great choice image quality has
gone from awful to actually surprisingly
good in the last 5 years but the biggest
advantage of using something like the
GoPro in my mind is the sheer number of
places you can put it the hero4 has a
multitude of 1st and 3rd party
accessories that allow mounting to
basically anywhere your imagination
wants it to go from using on a selfie
stick jumping into a clear cenote using
the head mounts to get a first-person
view while running up a Mayan ruin and
even capturing a sea turtle on a 70 foot
dive we made great uses of all of these
mounts during our trip in Mexico what's
great about this is that it enables us
to get shots that otherwise aren't
possible due to space or operational
constraints sometimes you just don't
have any hands-free to hold a larger
camera the biggest obvious drawback of a
GoPro is that it does not by default
have any way to preview your image on
the camera GoPro solution to this is to
monitor your camera through their app on
iOS and Android which is fine if you're
mounting esthetically and you are
certain it won't get bumped when you're
in the middle of the action but in
practice this is not always simple to
achieve while GoPros marketing is
centered almost entirely on their
products in extreme situations I
included it in this roundup because with
the hero4 black you can shoot 12
megapixel stills
in a variety of different modes
including single-shot burst mode time
lapse and night lapse while the hero4
black edition is the highest tier model
of gopro there are other models
available at more affordable price
points but overall even though the
waterproof housing is included a gopro
and mounts can end up being a dauntingly
expensive option for casual users and on
that note here's an even pricier option
an underwater housing made specifically
for your camera we've opted for the IKE
light housing for the rx100 mark for a
wonderfully powerful little
point-and-shoot camera that is great for
travel and that I explored in more
detail here the i-clay housing allows
you to use the rx100 completely
submerged with a depth rating of 200
feet though you'll need to make sure to
check your seals each time you submerge
because Linus forgot to grease the
o-ring and managed to get water into it
on a 70 foot scuba trip though
unfortunately the camera survived with
the rx100 unlike the other options we
have looked at so far you have a greater
range in your field of view thanks to
the rx100 it's great 24 to 70 millimeter
equivalent zoom range now before you go
out and buy a fancy underwater housing
for whatever camera you love to use keep
in mind that while this was the best
option we looked at from an image
quality point of view and no small part
thanks to its 24 to 70 millimeter
equivalent zoom range and the excellent
1 inch sensor from Sony with this
particular eye clay I had no controls
for the dial on the arts 100 forcing me
to set my aperture and shutter speed
before getting into the water along with
a limited exposure control I found the
zoom rocker on the housing to be very
stiff to use I would turn it in one
direction but it would very easily go
past the focal length that I intended
minor control hurdles aside housings
like this are mainly made for those who
are seriously getting into underwater
video and stills since you'll pay
upwards of $300 for the housing alone so
in conclusion waterproofing your
particular camera solution can vary from
simple and hands-off to requiring
patience and set up time I hope this
video helps you make your decision
regardless of your budget speaking of
awesome things that you could travel
with mass drop we have an awesome
featured deal from them today the DJI
phantom 4 bundle this bundle includes
