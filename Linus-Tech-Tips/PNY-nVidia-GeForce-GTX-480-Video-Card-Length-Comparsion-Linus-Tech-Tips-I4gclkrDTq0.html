length the length of these graphics
cards so I have three graphics cards
here today the first one is the
brand-new GTX 480 this is a P my cart so
the first thing we're gonna do is
compare it against no no the first thing
we're gonna do is we're going to take
the actual length of this particular
graphics card so this tape measure is in
inches this graphics card is exactly
10.5 inches long it reaches that very
mark right there and it doesn't go much
past that and one advantage it has over
some even smaller cards is that the PCI
Express power connectors are up on the
top of the part so that means as long as
you have 10.5 inches of clearance in
your case you should be able to install
a GTX 480 in it now the next one we have
is the 58 70 and this is just for
comparison purposes here can I actually
get like an overhead shot of all three
cards can you can you are you able to do
that without this trap getting in the
way ok so you can see that it is a
little bit longer if we take the
measurements of this card you can see
it's just exactly 11 inches long and now
that seems a little bit unnecessary to
me because you can see that quite a bit
of this is actually just random plastic
so they probably could have made this
card ten point five inches but it does
also use the power connectors up on the
top of the board so as long as you have
room for eleven inches then you will be
okay last one is the fifty nine seventy
this is one of the longest cards on the
market with the plastic shroud that goes
back goes out past it it actually is
about twelve and a quarter inches long
so that is a fall if I could remember
how long this was so that's another ten
point five twelve and a quarter eleven
point five 1.75 inches longer than the
GTX 480 so thank you for checking out my
video about the length of the GeForce
GTX 480</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
