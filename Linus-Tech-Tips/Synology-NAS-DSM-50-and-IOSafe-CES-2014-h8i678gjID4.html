brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here at
Synology checking out DSM 5 now I love
Synology Nast drives we've used them a
few times in the office and they're
showing off quite a few cool things with
the new software first off is Quick
Connect so the idea behind this is if
you're not a super complicated end user
and you just kind of want to plug it in
and let it run cooking X will let you
let you do a simple install and then
you're good to go you don't have to mess
with your router you don't need to
remember IPS you don't need to do all
that kind of stuff that you used to have
to do in these situations and it's
automatically set up throughout the app
so say you want to access your data on
the phone it's good to go right away the
next one is cloud station and
essentially it alight it enables you to
have as complicated as a cloud setup as
you want so let's start with a
complicated one and then get a little
bit more simple so first off you've got
a few disk stations on the east coast of
Canada and a few dist stations on the
west coast of Canada they need them to
interface with each other all the times
you have backups remotely on each end
you can have that set up so it's all
synchronized and automatically going all
the time it's very easy to set up as
well as more simple situations so you
take a picture on your phone and you
want it sync with all your friends and
your mom and your dad or whatever you
can take that picture and as long as you
have the obligation you can stick it out
to everyone easily and seamlessly next
up there's social network backup so you
can back up Facebook Google+ everything
I think that was already in the app but
now they have YouTube which is
specifically cool for us because it
could automatically backup YouTube
videos that you upload other than that
they've also generally just refined the
interface there's much more logical
grouping of different ideas and
applications now and for instance
backups instead of be different backup
things being kind of all over the app
all of the backups are in one simple
easy to find area at this same booth
there's IO safe running dsm-5 as well
and if you guys haven't seen it you
should go back and watch but we've made
a video for IO safe in the past and to
be completely honest when Lana's tasked
me with planning out this video I didn't
believe it was going to work I hooked up
my brother's fire department all that
kind of stuff but I expected the thing
to fail and it won gloriously it wasn't
even really a close contest it easily
beat what was going on and in the
background here on the video they have a
much more intensive test than we even
ran running on this guy right here which
is the 15 13 plus it's a little bit more
hefty of a price but it's
expandable and there's way more drives
and it's just a higher-end system so if
you're someone who's in say small
business or you're running your own
business a photography videography
whatever the heck you're doing if you
need tons of storage and you need it to
be safe this is probably something you
should look into as it is fire and water
proof thank you for watching our content
on Synology and IO safe if you want to
see all the rest of our CES 2014 content
