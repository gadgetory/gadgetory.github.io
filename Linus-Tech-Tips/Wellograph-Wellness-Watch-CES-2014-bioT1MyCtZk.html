brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital here we are with the
well Oh graph now to be clear guys
unlike a lot of the things we're going
to be looking at at the show this is not
necessarily a SmartWatch it's well it's
a Wella graph it's meant to provide you
with a picture of your overall health
and well-being so it includes the usual
watch functionality of course there's a
there's a screen you can have different
watch faces and stuff like that can have
analog digital web no it's obviously
it's all digital but don't worry too
much about that it does have a sapphire
crystal screen covering so I can go
ahead and I can take they're doing a
demo with some exacto knives where
they're scratching it and showing it
that it doesn't scratch now what
functionality does it actually have on
board it has a heart rate monitor an
activity tracker and a running watch so
I'll show these to you guys one at a
time we'll probably just do this in
b-roll so first up you can see the heart
rate monitor works with a series of
green glowing dots on the back I don't
know exactly how they work but check
this out guys there you go goes like
that monitors your heart rate in real
time it stores your data for up to four
months so what that means is it can give
you all kinds of useful data it can tell
you about your resting heart rate it can
tell you about how you compare to other
people your age it can tell you your
fitness age and it can even act as a
motivator giving you for the activity
tracker functionality a little heart
that fills up as you do more things that
day the pedometer also works in real
time so you could literally I mean I
dunno X's are Li recommend doing this
that you could literally walk down the
street and have the pedometer updating
you in real time how much you're walking
that day in terms of charging this is
always a question that i have about
these kinds of things micro USB to a
base station but other than that you go
ahead and throw it on a base station for
the night it comes with two different
straps so it comes with a nato strap as
well as a leather strap so you can
decide if you want something that's
going to feel a little bit more
appropriate at the office or something
that's more appropriate for well going
out for a run if the you know run watch
functionality is going to be something
that they're going to advertise about it
overall looks pretty stylish of they are
asking for three hundred and twenty
dollars for at those
so there's going to be a lot of
competition in terms of wellness
monitoring as well as smart watches over
this year and I'm definitely excited to
see how this one fares when it comes out
sometime around april of 2014 guys don't
miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
remember our trip to the show this year
sponsored by NCIX your source for great
technology selection and service poor
