over a year now and in that time we've
printed everything from GoPro mounts to
RAM storage trays to projectiles for a
vacuum cannon it's an incredibly useful
tool but it has left us wanting not
being able to print models with complex
overhangs multiple materials or colors
and the need to set up a Genki webcam
rig to monitor prints when we're away
from the office has been frustrating
then there's the performance issues the
main one that we ran into was with the
feeder the hot motor was too close to
the thermally conductive gears meaning
that instead of moving the filament the
gears would also melt the filament and
it's these types of issues that well
outside of the monstrous costs are a big
part of what's preventing 3d printing
from reaching the mainstream right now
let's see what ultime charisma table
with their third-generation Alta maker 3
which they claim makes professional 3d
printing accessible
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise isolation and
it's optimized for different liquid
radiator configurations learn more at
the link below
first on alta maker threes laundry list
of usability improvements is dual
extrusion oh my god I couldn't be more
excited for this yes there were ways
that you could do before but it wasn't
made for it so now we can make stuff
like this using two different colors in
one model it's awesome no more after
print modding for this PLA soldier you
can just have the material be the color
you desire in the first place which will
not only look better but will hold up
better over time as well then our PVA
ultimate your PVA is a dissolvable
filament what basically you can use
print core AAA to extrude normal PLA
filament plastic stuff when we've been
using for a while now then you can
hot-swap print core BB into the other
side of the your dual extruder it has
custom nozzle geometry optimized for
support materials in this case just the
stuff I just mentioned its PVA PVA
stands for polyvinyl alcohol it's a
water-soluble support material that
works perfectly alongside dual extrusion
printers to help create complex models
models with large overhangs or even
models with deep internal cavities this
incredibly satisfied man demonstrates
how you can use PVA alongside PLA to
print something amazingly complex then
just add water and the end result is
magic inspired we decided to print our
own awesome thing Tyler found this
badass Chinese lion statue that needed
support filament and it works great the
whole process from dunking it into the
water to rinsing it off in the sink and
yes it is safe to dissolve into tap
water and pour down the drain because
it's fully biodegradable it took about
two hours and finally second on the list
is the printers much improved
accessibility instead of
just a full-sized SD card slot which it
really should have been USB if you were
just going to have one option you can
now send print jobs over 12 USB type-a a
land connection on the back of the unit
or even Wi-Fi which is awesome in third
place we have the built-in webcam it's
resolution is sort of garbage but it's
mostly okay it does what it's supposed
to do
allowing you to remotely monitor the
print so sorry if that triggers here or
whatever but you don't need 4k 60fps
stream just to make sure it's not
totally screwed and get on with the rest
of your day to be clear I'd never say no
to high resolution and framerate but
most print errors are so obvious anyways
that you'd probably want to go check it
out in person even if you needed that
more resolution the fourth awesome
feature is smart material detection when
you put a material spool or filament
spool onto the back of the Ultimaker
containing an NFC chip your printer will
read it and handle all of the annoying
fine-tuning like adjusting printhead
temperature and bed temperature and
other material specific settings this
should help out newcomers in a huge way
and even reduce troubleshooting time for
experienced users and on the experts
subject you can of course to override
those settings if you want which leads
us what's feature number five the auto
leveling bed this doesn't last because
it's unimpressive or anything that
doesn't really attend to say here the
glass plate the thing that you print
things on to it auto levels now which is
awesome because manually leveling it was
tedious so it just does it itself now
I'm repeating myself at this point
that's probably fine so in conclusion
the overall quality of the final product
when printing a single filament model
that's within the capabilities of both
printers and we tested this by printing
a test model with a bunch of different
types of geometry on it gives only a
slight edge to the Ultimaker 3 which
only stood out because it did a better
job with the bridge at the top of the
fig most improvements are more to do
with quality of life which isn't a
criticism because overall reliability
was an obvious point of focus the
ability to print with two different
colors types of materials or even
dissolve
materials is amazing the complexity and
functionality of the tools and widgets
that we can build is going to skyrocket
but after that rocket has been flying
for a few hours well it's going to get
to the price of this unit the ultime
curve 3 cost about three times as much
as the car that I bought when I turn 16
this is a serious investment and unlike
previous ulta makers which seem to be
geared towards affluent enthusiasts I
expect only people running some form of
business will end up purchasing one of
