it's important for a hotel to have some
kind of stick on-site casino a cheap
buffet affordable by the hour rates you
know it all depends what you're into
as for Taiwanese brand 168th in well
they've got normal hotels like the stay
in taipei that we were at during
Computex this year but then once the
show was over they invited us to come
see something pretty different that
they're doing in nearby talian so behind
me is the AI hotel a gaming hotel the
first of its kind in Taiwan as for what
makes a hotel gaming well apparently
it's 55 something 4k something dxracer
presumably chairs and GT X 1080 T eyes
what okay we're gonna have to go check
this out or check in as it were get it
it's a hotel joke or at least we'll do
so after this message from our sponsor
thermal takes view 37 mid-tower case can
support up to an e ATX motherboard with
a fully modular design check it out at
the link below to learn more
the check-in process is pretty normal
other than the king-size helping of RGB
so yeah check-in and then you check in
they've got their g-force ihcafe
certification proudly on display they're
actually the only hotel in Taiwan to
mean nvidia standard and then the lobby
opens up to well these guys know their
audience the included breakfast is
served along that side and then on this
side well some hotels have a rockin gym
but 168 in figured that a big 12 player
land center was a better bed and if
their guests really wanted to get their
heart rate up they would go and plug
into the HTC vive VR machine that's over
there in the hallway so there's nobody
here right now but anyone staying here
can use these machines as much as they
want the idea behind this common area is
that the guests can get to know each
other by coming out of their rooms to
play games together and eSports teams
can hold practices throughout the day or
night it's open 24 hours so the
Australian team blank eSports was
actually here for two months during
overwatch contenders and apparently
basically never left the lobby and these
are the best machines in the building
with core i7 8700 s 16 gigs of who is
that our GB RAM very nice very nice GT X
1080 TI graphics cards 165 Hertz decent
gaming monitors about 10 terabytes of
local storage for game files and premium
gaming peripherals the team was
apparently thrilled with the setup here
compared to their normal routine which
is to find a house to rent to ship all
of their gear up and then ship it all
back when they finish so the plan from
my hotel is to upgrade the hardware here
every year to make sure that they stay
stay
now let's head into one of the rooms in
hotel laundry is actually something I
wish more places did it seems like such
an obvious way to make a longer stay
more comfortable anyway here we are this
is their standard room with either two
twins or one full bed and you have got
to be kidding me
they are really proud of a lot of the
gamer centric changes that they've made
to the standard hotel setup so for
example every one of the rooms has dual
sound isolating doors that have been
verified to keep inside noise to 40
decibels or less and comes equipped with
not one but two separate full-fledged
gaming rigs equipped with 32 inch
monitors gtx 1060 videocards core i5
cpus 16 gigs of ram a full set of gaming
grade peripherals including the chair
and yes again with the 10 terabytes of
local storage so you can jump on your
favorite game launcher and download
whatever you want to it the boot drive
wipes itself upon reboot so you don't
have to worry about someone accidentally
getting into your account if you check
out and forget to sign up some other
aspects of the room that I appreciate as
someone who travels fair amount is that
there are tons of outlets both normal
wall plugs and USB one so that you can
charge all of your crap and then this
one in particular on the bed here is
freakin brilliant why doesn't every hold
this an international plug in the room
so you don't have to arrive you're all
jet-lagged realize that you can't plug
in your whatever thing and spend the
first couple of hours of your vacation
buying some stupid adapter that you
accidentally left sitting on the bed at
home the TV setup is pretty slick too so
I don't recognize this brand and it like
I don't know it looks okay but it's a 4k
TV that more importantly is connected in
a really cool way so this system over
here closest to the bed has an HDMI
connection over that TV so that means
that you can run anything you want on it
you just set this up on here fullscreen
and pippity poppity Wow you are watching
Linus tech tips from the comfort of your
bed and it's not just limited to their
systems so here on the side of the bed
again is another HDMI input for the TV a
headphone jack so that you can listen
using headphones if you'd prefer and a
USB port so that if you were running say
for example your phone as an output to
the TV you wouldn't run out of battery
while it sits here on the nightstand now
if you don't pack the necessary cables
they provide them for free along with a
handful of other useful extras I mean
most of our focus so far has been on the
gaming features but this is still a
hotel so if the bed or the bathroom
sucks you're going to have a bad time
fortunately they went full fancy with
Slumberland mattresses they put a fridge
in every room which I personally really
appreciate because it is impossible to
find cold water over here and check
these them japanese-style toilets we
have heated seats and water cleaners if
you prefer those squeaky clean this next
room style is actually one that they
don't advertise on their site so it's
designed to look and feel kind of like a
college dorm for them nostalgia feels
with that said other than replacing the
regular bed with a
but it is pretty similar to the standard
room although there is one thing that I
missed before when I was showing the
standard room this is really cool ah
it's over here got a call under the desk
every room gets its own dedicated Wi-Fi
access point so you don't have to worry
about you know getting that room at the
end of the hall with the crappy
reception now it's time for the best for
last portion of our tour they only have
one of these but this is the capsule
room it's at their standard room but in
space so first they've got the wall oh
gaming machines six in total so you
could have your whole team in here at
once and then second is the sleeping
pods so each of these things is equipped
with a memory foam mattress it's
isolated for noise and light it's got
individual climate control it's got its
own power connectivity so regular AC and
USB it contains its own safe and check
this out it's got its own TV so in the
capsule room you can travel with your
friends or colleagues and never actually
see them if you get stuck there is an
SOS button by the way so okay about that
so then who exactly is staying in a
place like this though I mean you can't
fill up an entire hotel year round just
based on traveling eSports players well
as it turns out after they built the AI
hotel they found business coming from
unexpected places
local families have come to stay as a
treat for their kids for doing well in
school or whatever because they don't
have a nice gaming PC at home some folks
just come and stay here for the fast
internet international stock traders and
would be concert goers who want to have
their best chance
by a hot ticket that's likely to sell
out in 10 seconds have frequented this
place and all other things being equal I
would definitely choose a hotel like
this for Linus Media Group's travels I
mean even if we didn't end up using the
machines for video editing the
peripherals the extra monitors things
like that are fantastic and I mean I no
longer take for granted stuff that seems
fairly simple like a decent sized desk
and a wired network connection in fact
most of the big hotels that I've stayed
at in the last couple of years have been
disabling their Ethernet ports for some
inexplicable reason so let me know what
you guys think are you a gamer are you
some other kind of consumer who would be
interested in this or do you think the
whole concept is just crazy I want to
see your comments below and you know
