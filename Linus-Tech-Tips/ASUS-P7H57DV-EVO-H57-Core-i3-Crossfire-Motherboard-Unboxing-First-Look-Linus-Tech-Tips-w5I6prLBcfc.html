of the asou p7h 57 d - v evo now that
may be a slightly confusing model number
two most but I can explain it
p7 is the latest generation of Intel
processors so it denotes socket 1156 age
57 is the chipset D means that it
includes both true USB 3.0 and true SATA
6 gigabits per second I don't know what
the V means and I don't know what the
Evo means but I was pretty close okay so
is Windows 7 ready as I mentioned before
it includes support for LGA 1156 that
means Core i3 Core i5 and core i7 but
you should also note that on the core i3
in the core i5 dual course you also have
support for the onboard video included
with those processors that feature won't
work with Core i5 quad cores or with
core i7s so let's go around to the back
and see what asus has to say for
themselves with this board
you've got SLI and CrossFireX support
which seems at first like kind of a
weird thing for an H series chipset
which is a value series chipset but this
board is quite feature complete and
really it gives us Zeus a way to release
a powerful board with lots of features
that includes support for onboard video
as well as hybrid video should you
require it so let's have a look at the
accessories that are included the first
thing we find is an i/o shield this is
their premium looking i/o shield with
the fluffy back silvery thing on the
back and a black okay moving on then we
have an eSATA and USB 2.0 PCI backplate
next we have an IDE cable should you
require it maybe you have an old DVD
Drive that uses one then we have an SLI
bridge it's flexible then we have their
Q connectors so this makes life a little
bit easier for you if you're using an
older case that doesn't have the the USB
connectors in a block and it also makes
your life a little bit easier for
installing the front switches okay then
we have four SATA cables to right angle
and two straight there black cables
which I always like to see it makes your
build look just a little bit nicer
have like bright red or like bright
yellow cables included okay then we've
got a user's guide which includes a
support DVD as well as an assist occur
don't use this DVD download the latest
drivers and utilities off the Asus
website all right let's get the mid
plate a Seuss's big thing for the last
couple of years it's been green
packaging they don't use any foam in
their packaging uh you know see piece of
cardboard on the back of the motherboard
instead of fun it hasn't affected the
reliability of the board so it's it's a
great great step that they've made
alright so like most LGA 1156 boards and
by that I mean all there is an LGA 1156
socket right in the middle so that's
where you're gonna have your support for
core i3 Core i5 and core i7 up at the
top of the board not quite in its ideal
location but it should still be quite
easy to do cable management up to here
you've got your 8 pin CPU connector so
that's one indicator that this is not a
low end board is that you do have an 8
pin CPU connector rather than a 4 pin
it's designed to deliver quite a lot of
power to the CPU would be quite
comfortable overclocking a core i7 on
this particular board moving along to
the right we have a Seuss's trademark
dual channel ddr3 with their easy
install system here so that means that
you've only got a clip on the top side
and all you do is slide the module in
from the one side and then clip it in
from the top very nice to see here we've
got our 24 pin connector as well as a
Seuss's mem ok button so that makes sure
that no matter what modules you install
in here you press that button it'll run
them at a safe setting that makes it so
you can post and then adjust according
to what you require ok moving down the
board we've got the chipset covered by a
quite ineffective looking heatsink but
that should tell you a little bit about
the chipset here the age 57 chipset is
not really doing a whole lot it doesn't
get very hot so asus is able to make
more of a fashion statement with their
heatsink rather than I have it actually
worried about it cooling a really hot
chip next we have our IDE connector
which is there and then we have the 6
SATA 2 ports that are going to be run
off the age 57 chipset
down along the bottom of the board we
have our front panel connectors as well
as a couple oh I buy a couple I mean
four USB 2.0 front headers all of these
blue ones are for USB 2.0 and then down
at the very bottom here we have our SATA
6 gigabits per second connectors
personally I would have liked to see
these up where the IDE connector was
rather than down there but I guess
that's life okay then we have firewire
support that's nice
we have a FireWire port right here and
then our front audio is right there so
that is where all the ports are now
let's have a look at the PCI slot layout
number man's racing ahead of me here PCI
slot the hood is down here there you go
okay so we have two PCIe 1x two PCI
three PCIe 1x pardon me and then you
have two PCIe 16x slots but you can
clearly see here the pins only go up to
here so this one runs at 16x electrical
and this one runs at 8x Electrical now
that doesn't actually have any
real-world impact on crossfire
configuration so don't worry about that
but if you're running a single graphics
card you're gonna want to throw it in
here just because all right here they're
using their fortress of solitude style
MOSFET coolers here I really like these
I think they're very stylish looking and
they do a reasonably good job of cooling
these are held down by pushpins and so
we can have a look at the top one there
as well very cool
Zeus has really figured out color
schemes on their boards in the last
couple years I mean that's uh it used to
be like you know the cardboard yellow
orange e Brown PCBs and just random
lookin now everything's sort of like an
icy sort of themed look moving on next
we have USB 2.0 ports one two three four
that is all not a whole lot in terms of
USB 2.0 ports one ps2 one optical audio
out we have HDMI DVI and VGA out then we
have firewire and eSATA one Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio did I mention USB
3.0 so you've actually got a total of
six USB ports and two of them are USB
3.0 now with so many cases having four
front USB ports I can see why a SUSE
opted to
include more internal headers rather
than including more ports on the back of
the board so that seems like a pretty
smart move thank you for checking up my
unboxing at the p7h 57 D - V Evo</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
