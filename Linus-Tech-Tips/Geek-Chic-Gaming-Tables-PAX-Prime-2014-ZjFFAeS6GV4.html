protector for your mobile device hey
guys we're here checking out geek chic I
know this isn't necessarily a computer
hardware person's dream because it's
just a desk but a little sneak peek for
you is that they are going to be
releasing a computer version of their
desks later on it will be a personal
computer station from geek chic that'll
be pretty interesting it's not out yet
they don't have it here none of that
kind of stuff I've just been teased that
from one of their people so that's
pretty cool but I know you guys are
nerds I want to check out the emissary
in general this is their most popular
desk it is sold the most it's not cheap
you'll notice from the price tag it is
not cheap but if you look into the
materials that are in this thing this
quality of wood is going to be a super
expensive desk anyway so if you were
looking into a desk in this range
already this might be a good idea if
you're like oh I need a desk for my dorm
room which is cheap maybe don't buy an
emissary but if you were looking for
like a dining room table which this can
double as it might actually be pretty
good for your dining room table speaking
of which as you can see right now the
top of it is uncovered it is a playing
surface you can use these for pretty
much any board games D&amp;amp;D Settlers of
Catan Warhammer whatever you want to do
you can set up a table they they set you
up with a person who will ask you what
kind of games you play and they'll
properly design the table for you and it
kind of transforms a little bit
depending on how you have the Leafs
installed so the lease can cover it up
completely and make it a dining room
table or uncover it partially make it a
small gaming surface where you can still
eat on it or uncover it completely and
make it so that you can use something
like the customizable expandable drawers
which can be used as eating surfaces
laptop surfaces little dungeon master
hideaways if you're playing D&amp;amp;D or
various other things depending on on
again how you configure them other
different accessories you can get go
from cup holders to dice holders to
pretty much anything you can attach to
the table and it doesn't end there these
guys also make chairs and benches and
stuff like that there but hugging
technology that they talk about on their
chairs is actually kind of amazing I've
never sat in a wooden chair that I
thought was remotely comfortable before
and I would probably rather sit
this wooden chair than a padded chair I
know that's really hard to get across on
video but if you ever have a chance to
go to a convention that these guys are
at I highly suggest sitting in their
chairs another thing that I have which
isn't quite as comfortable in my opinion
but kind of awesome is their storage
benches it's a bench that you can have
which is customizable to the length of
the table so they make it perfectly for
you and if you open up the top there's
storage compartments under there so say
you're a magic player you put a ton of
cards under this bench or if you just
need dice or figurines or anything else
like that miniatures whatever it is you
can have them in the benches which is
really cool
another thing again is in the table
under the Leafs or in the polo drawers
there's semi-permanent storage so
essentially for my group of buddies if
we wanted to come over to my house and
play risk and we play for six hours but
we're nowhere close to being done we can
cover it up I can go through the week
normally and then the next weekend we
can uncover it our whole risk game is
still there ready to play personally I
think this is pretty sick again I know
it's not really PC stuff but if you are
looking for a dining room table and you
want something badass maybe check out
