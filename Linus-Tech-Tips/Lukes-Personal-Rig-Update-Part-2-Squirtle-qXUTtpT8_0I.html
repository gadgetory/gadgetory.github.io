like part 2 of my build blog this is the
continuation of squirtle we've ditched
the 800 d disgusting mess that I had
before and now we've moved to this
partially built test bench huge
improvement what this video is really
about is asking questions about what I
can do with this test bench so I'm
trying to figure out things about it as
there's not a ton of information out
there is I want with something fairly
obscure just cuz I thought it looked
pretty cool yes it's 80/20 extrusion so
I could have just built this on my own
but I didn't want to rip the guy's
design off that's not really fair what I
am going to end up doing though is
butchering this thing like crazy and
changing it a lot to make it my own and
in that we're going to be trying to
figure out how many rads I can fit to
this thing because the most I've ever
seen it with is one triple and I want to
fit four radiators on it I was kind of
hoping to three by 120s and two 2x1 20s
I don't think I'm going to get quite
there but I still want to get four
radiators on it I want to see where I
can fit this a fairly large reservoir
especially for this style of computer
and I want to see if I can do that in a
pretty cool place which you'll hopefully
see later and I want to see about how I
can access things in the bottom of the
computer so we're gonna try and answer
all those questions in this video where
I kind of mess around with this test
bench if you want to see all the rest of
these build log videos as they come out
stay subscribe the Linus tech tips let's
get a move on
save on select Intel CPUs knucks and
SSDs with special Black Friday rebates
from select retailers click now to learn
more first things first we ought to do a
little bit of out with the old in with
the new so I'm going to get rid of that
pretty old power supply I'm going to get
rid of that hold not very usable at this
point for what I want to do graphics
card and that gigantic air cooler I'm
going to leave the motherboard because
while I won't necessarily be using this
motherboard specifically it's the right
size so it's not really that big of a
deal and I do need it to be there so I
can kind of see how stuff like cables
are going to be routing and stuff like
that which I won't need the GPU for and
the GPU would be more annoying than
anything later on I'll have to have a
placeholder GPU so I can see how like
the water cooling is going to come up
and get to that but for now should be
fine now that all the old stuff has been
removed it's time to start strapping
radiators to it so the first thing I'm
going to do is grab one of the spare out
focal radiators that we had at work a
the 3 by 120 and try to put it on
alongside my other in parallel at least
my other 3 by 120 millimeter radiator my
current one is really thick this one is
not quite as thick but it's still pretty
thick radiator but we'll see how that
works I know this is going to fit this
isn't actually really a problem but I do
need to strap it to the bench just to
make sure that other things will be able
to fit alongside it it's self fitting is
not necessarily the most important thing
everything else being able to fit inside
the same eco system is also extremely
important now that that's strapped to
the bench I need to go to the smaller
end cap where I find out that as I
expected the 2 by 120 millimeter
radiator is too long I do not want to
have it on the outside I do want it to
be on the inside of the bench just so I
won't get hit by anything anything like
that
so it's too long it's not going to work
I was kind of hoping it would and I
could custom fit the bench to make it
bigger to accommodate for it but that
would make the bench really big and get
rid of the whole compact nature of it
which I do like so not going to go that
route moving onwards the 140 millimeter
single radiator also didn't fit this got
me a little bit worried I actually kind
of thought that one would work but no
the fitting where the fittings should go
on that radiator collided with another
one of the radiators that I had inside
and I don't want to swap either of those
out I like the thick three by one 20s so
that one didn't work
luckily moving on to the single 120
millimeter radiator that one fit pretty
much perfectly so we're pretty good four
rads at this point all right so we're
three four three four radiators so far
and we've covered the whole side of the
bench in radiators that has the kind of
like power supply at the bottom of the
motherboard area something to take note
of here is before I started strapping
radiators to it my plan was to have the
reservoir come out of the cable
management hole for the power supply as
I thought that would look really cool
and I space tested it before I put the
radiators in just hold that in your
memory for now we're going to move on to
fitting that last radiator now problem
with fitting last radiator I don't have
another 120 millimeter radio to test
here but I'm not worried about the
spacing as the spacing is exactly the
same as on the other side so the idea of
fitting a radiator here well the idea of
fitting the radiators all around the
bottom is I thought it would look cool
to have kind of like a radiator blackout
on the bottom of this test bench so that
was a huge part of the inspiration of
doing this I want to make sure it fit
I'm happy it fit I also kind of need to
be able to access the bottom the
computer though of course if I tilt the
entire test bench up I could reach up
from the bottom and access it there but
that's really annoying so solution put
one of the 120 millimeter radiators on
hinges that's going to be this side
where the top of the motherboard is
facing the CPU end of the test bench so
I'm going to put this radiator on hinges
I still have to go pick those up though
but it will fit I'm not super worried
about that to be able to manage the
tubing under there I'm fully expecting
to utilize a combination of putting key
rings over the tubing and then hooking
those key rings up to springs so that
when I pull the radiator out the tube
will pull along with it but not kind of
go everywhere I want the springs to be
able to manage it properly it's gonna be
an interesting project but that's for a
different video not this video so far
all right so that kind of concludes Reds
we're essentially four four four at this
point the last one while I don't have
the hinges already on it we're
that'll mess with the spacing a little
bit will fit if it doesn't work with the
hinges it will work with the flat plates
that's fine I can just access it from
the bottom but I'm pretty sure it will
work with the hinges regardless so we're
fine for radiators at this point not too
worried about it need to move back to
the reservoir need to forget how I'm
gonna remote mount it from the bottom
okay
well this is where the figurative poop
started hitting the fan things were not
okay the radiators were in the way the
7-inch power supply which was actually
longer my power supply personally was
longer than the one that I used to have
on the bench things were not going to
work I would have needed a reservoir
that was less than half the diameter of
this one to be able to make it actually
work not good news at all how am I going
to fix this well there's a lot of fancy
extrusion work that I could do by taking
the motherboard support braces and
chopping them off at the end of the
motherboard so they don't go all the way
down I could take the power supply
support brace which also supports the
leather boards and ship that up more
towards the motherboard and then add a
little bit on to the side to make sure
that it can still support the power
supply I could do a whole bunch of this
stuff with the extrusion to try and open
up that space still didn't solve the
problem though the radiators aren't
going to move and I already don't have a
thick three by 120 alpha cool radiator
like on the other side on that side of
the computer so shrinking the rads isn't
really going to help a ton either might
have a little bit but not much what
really needs to happen is the power
supply needs to be swapped out again
power supply that I have personally was
never actually tested on this bench but
it's just over seven inches and I tested
one that was just over seven inches that
was not going to work first solution
that I came up with was a Silverstone
short SFX 600 watt power supply which
you guys have probably seen the video
featured by Linus it worked it made
sense but it didn't look good and it's
only a 600 watt there's not a ton of
flexibility in terms of cabling and/or
power so I wanted something a little bit
more I wanted an ATX sized power supply
because it looked kind of weird having
an SFX on this bench so I found silver
stones other kind of short power supply
which is one of their 850 was more
wattage cool more flexibility in terms
of cabling
pool and also an ATX format so it fit
cool
triple cool it worked and it worked by
what I would say is less than
millimeters how the reservoir fits in
there right now it is touching on every
single side it is touching the
motherboard it is touching the radiator
on its other side it is touching the
other radiator and it is touching the
power supply there is literally no extra
room at all I can't believe I got this
to work there's a couple options that I
can do for fitting the cables around it
but it's going to work
you can ask Brandon I was pretty freaked
out at this point in the build I was
like wow my entire plan is not going to
work I'm going to have to change how I'm
mounting a whole bunch of stuff might
have to ditch some radiators all just to
be able to fit a reservoir in there I
might even have to ditch this reservoir
altogether because it's too tall to
realistically fit into the bottom of the
case unless I can have it poking up the
top my whole plan from the beginning was
to have this reservoir poking up through
that hole and it might not have worked
so pretty stoked that it did so without
all figured out what are my actionable
items well I need to figure out exactly
how I'm going to mount this to be able
to do that I need to finish that
extrusion job so I'm gonna have to go
shopping at a metal shop try to figure
out the exact lengths of all the
extrusion I need and do the tedious job
of setting that all up then I need to
figure out how to mount this which will
probably be an extrusion based box with
a plate on top of it so we can sit there
and I'd screw it into that hopefully
that will work
we'll have to see that'll probably be
next video I also need my motherboard
RAM and CPU to kind of show up so
that'll happen at some point but I'm not
too worried about that then I need to
figure out my like fittings set up the
bottom of the computer is already set up
with how the radiators are orientated so
that they kind of feed into each other
in a big square which is fine and
logical because of how messy the area
where the reservoir is going to be is
I'm going to have to have the water
cooling for the graphics card come up
just below the motherboard on this side
and then I'll have a right angle on the
graphics card so we can grab it from
there then I would just go straight up
to the CPU and have it drop down just
above the motherboard on this side
obviously I'm going to have to see like
Oh should I have a right angle here
should I not have a right angle here all
that kind of stuff but it's fairly
straightforward as of now so I need to
go shopping for fittings I need to get
some extrusion and I need to have my
components show up
