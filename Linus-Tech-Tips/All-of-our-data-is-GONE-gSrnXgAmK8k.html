problem today on this section of the
moving but we've been moved in four
months moving vlog um something is going
on with the server and we haven't been
able to work on a project for more than
like 30 minutes at a time before the
server crashes and our computers all
freeze and then we're all sad because we
can't work on them most we do is on the
server well I do it I'm actually doing
some writing right now because I can't
you'd see I'd love to be working -
anything that doesn't see the server we
can do now well that's not much but it
always seems to go down yeah
but the worst when there's nothing else
to do you're kidding but you know Yolo
you only live once let's see let's see
the stress that Linus is going through
it's probably gonna crash like while
you're doing good how do you fix servers
how do you fix it
don't tell Linus you okay sick
that's your go-to yeah
whether you're running a small business
or a 1 billion dollar even multi-billion
dollar enterprise Rackspace has your
dedicated storage environment covered
check out the link in the video
description to learn more alright so
here's the situation
Wanek server over the course of the last
couple of days has been spontaneously
going offline and turning off in spite
of my best efforts to turn it back on
and complete the backup that i'm in the
middle of trying to do to our new unread
volt while I was standing in front of it
I observed one of my raid controllers
giving up the ghost
so as a reminder this server is running
3 raid 5s striped together in Windows of
a total of 24 SSDs so if one of the raid
fives drops out entirely all the data is
gone only about 10% of the backup that I
was just in the middle of remaking is
saved so it's time to investigate
all right so here's one Xserve er so far
troubleshooting steps that I've tried
you never want to you never want to
rebuild something like this if there's a
possibility you're going to have to go
to a data recovery service because that
can make it much much worse so in terms
of troubleshooting steps
I tried transplanting it into another
case so that I could use a different
SATA backplane that didn't work I tried
a different power supply a better power
supply that didn't work none of that
fixed it and I even went as far as to
put in another LSI raid card that I had
and try to import the array but while it
did detect my drives all of them as
unconfigured good and a for an array it
was not able to import it so there is
some good news there though while I'm
getting firmware errors kicked out by
this card right here when I try to boot
all the drives are detected by another
card so hopefully it didn't write too
much garbled data to the array okay so
this is basically what I've been doing
for the last 14 hours is sending emails
contacting different data recovery
services there's some that are local
there's some that are not local but I'm
not ruling those ones out in fact right
now the most likely solution looks like
we recover data comm they've got some
some custom tools that they've created
that will allow them to SSH into the
system and actually potentially recover
the rate the missing raid 5 and then the
other two raid fives and assemble them
all together and export them as one
gigantic pile of data two to one of our
servers all without me actually having
to send the drives away which would be
pretty ideal now obviously an approach
like that would not work in the case of
physical damage to the drives but
because it is only a RAID controller
issue they're saying hey there's a shot
at this so let's
so I downloaded their remote recovery
client thing here so right now I'm
waiting for their custom Linux based
tool to load on a bootable external SSD
so that they can SSH into the server I'm
not having a good couple days right now
I can't get the utility to detect my my
USB Drive called tech support them oh
bloody hell
uh I just figured it out this is Linus
calling by the way I just realized I
have to run the wrd disk image as
administrator you think I should put
that in the documentation never fails
this is why it's a good idea to call
tech support because the second you call
them you'll solve the problem on your
own
alright so in theory we now have a
bootable right
okay so step one is getting this
unnecessary extraneous server out of the
way I'm grabbing a UPS to use now in a
perfect world I would have a motherboard
or an HP a card a host bus adapter card
that could allow me to plug in all 24 of
the drives for them to do their data
recovery magic on but what we're going
to have to settle for is having eight of
them plugged into the motherboard at a
time as each raid five is rebuilt raid
cards do all kinds of funny funny
nonsense and they don't give other
software direct access to the drives at
a bit level in some cases so we need to
remove all these drives and plug them in
directly to the motherboard okay now it
should boot to that in theory let's just
make sure all the drives are detected in
the BIOS and everything oh that's a
problem I need to pull up the other raid
controllers as well otherwise they're
going to be looking for their drives and
I don't have them powered up right now
okay
oh actually that doesn't look very good
PCIe for errors what
so let's make sure all of our drives are
even showing up Oh
that is extremely worrying oh that is
extremely worrying oh that's not good
that means potentially three of the
drives in a raid five are dead which
means this data is not coming back none
of it is particularly
no none of it none of those but I
thought we have none of it will be
coming back if we lost three drives from
one of the raid fives so let's try
moving things around I've never tested
the SATA ports on this board it's
possible three of them are dead
however extraordinarily unlikely that
would be five six okay we've got six now
okay that gives some hope
I'm just moving SATA ports around I was
just gonna say right now I'm even having
difficulty getting this system to post
so I'm I'm at a whole new level of
concern yeah I'll let you know I'll send
an email okay so I'm at the point now
where I don't want to put the drives on
this system let's go with this one I
didn't like all those PCI Express errors
that the bootable USB was kicking out I
don't like that some of these drives
aren't showing up I'm starting to wonder
if that's what corrupted the LSI card
will pain in the ass so thousand things
I can think of that I would rather be
doing right now okay I got seven right
now really yeah
Wow maybe it was bad PCI you line is
speaking well I can tell you what's
happening so far is I put it on the
system that I was running the raid card
and the drives in and that baby started
spitting out PCIe errors all over the
place so I got everything pulled out of
that system and I have plugged all the
drives now into a different test bench
and I'm trying to see cuz I wasn't even
getting all the drive showing up two
three four five six seven eight okay hey
you guys are on the phone for the magic
moment where all eight drives are
detected by a new motherboard so I'm
beginning to think there may be a
motherboard issue that caused the
firmware on that LSI controller to
corrupt in the first place so I'm
actually pressing enter and I am booting
up to your USB and it is loading
correctly on this I think that board is
dead
um okay well that's I don't know if that
makes it worse probably does doesn't it
you can tell me I can take it that says
waiting up to 60 more seconds for
network configuration good timing with
the follow up call if you'd called one
minute earlier I've been cursing you for
dialing my number so I have to answer my
phone because I was in the middle of
thinking only five of my drives were
being detected you guys know what you're
doing right I had a local shop that I
was going to physically physically take
it to and they basically they were like
they kind of freaked out when I said I
was having someone use their remote tool
they were like well unless these guys
really know what they're doing that's
pretty dangerous and I was like okay
well I'll check with them I'll make sure
they know what they're doing so so you
guys know what you're doing so basically
they're explaining that they're going to
virtually mount the volumes so we're not
doing any writing to my disks so even in
the event that we cannot recover it by
this means that still leaves other
options open to us okay there is okay
well that's that's very wonderful to
hear but I'm trying not to get too
excited right now
they sound pretty confident this is like
the ultimate roller coaster right now
so to put this in the appropriate
context for the viewers right now Wanek
server has several in progress projects
stored on it that do not have a backup
anywhere else including a fully shot
channel superfund that involved a
thousand dollars in equipment rental
including lots of footage from Linus
tech tips videos like it is going to be
a huge huge devastating loss for us to
lose this I mean it's got a lot of art
our templates for editing editing videos
for for scripting templates for employee
reviews like all kinds of stuff like
this is our main working server know the
off-site backup server has not ever been
built yet the vault was the backup
server if I ever have to like act in a
in a video where I have to look for
Lauren I'm going to think back to this
moment okay so I do need to reboot it
once in order to add that 8 terabyte
drive so anyway
right okay thank you very much gentlemen
I hope to speak too with good news race
soon uh twelve SATA connectors ah ah
okay so let's make sure everything is
showing up one two three four five six
seven eight of those our boot device and
our eight terabyte recovery media we are
ready to rock okay so within about ten
minutes they contact me back they said
okay yeah we're ready to have all the
drives in there so that means we are
gonna have to do some janky-ass right
now so basically what you're looking at
here is these drives are going to be
powered off this power supply with a
jumper these cards and all these drives
are going to be powered off of this rig
so now we can power all those drives
without powering up this motherboard or
any of that nonsense okay so we have a
grand total of twenty five drives
connected to this test bench sixteen of
which are running in Bay's of this
enclosure and eight of which are spread
out here so there we go there's one of
my LSI controllers there's it's eight
drives there's my other one whoa where
are your virtual drives
I think I remember a troubleshooting
step where I tried swapping all the
drives to different bays where I was
trying to see if it was the back plane
or the cables Wow panic moment there but
it's okay so now we should see two
virtual drives here on the screen that's
one set show me the second set Oh
thought we lost another raid5 there mmm
okay it's good feeling good
reality TV ain't got nothing on IT work
show me all the devices to rate adapters
one eight terabyte drive one two three
four five six seven eight kingston
drives
boom okay I will let the data recovery
specialists know all right so all that's
left now then I think I got in touch
with them and I asked if we can put a 10
gigabit network card in so we can
accelerate the offloading of all of our
files so while we're waiting for now is
for them to reboot the machine and set
me up with a network share that I can
access and fingers crossed just start
pulling off all the footage and while
everything else alright so check this
out here around here so I've got the
instructions for how to access our data
so I go into the tritium share and there
it is bunch of EULA's a bunch of stuff
we've got what looks like the file
structure let's test it how about one
that I that we haven't finished
releasing yet like something from the
the mail a battle over here let's just
let's watch it hmm okay exhale it is for
sure
Oh
okay here we can copy one of these let's
copy one of these clips to my local
machine and see if that helps nope oh
boy let's have a look I wonder if
everything's even here like I don't even
see the Linus tech tips folder 1 &amp;amp; 2 are
missing
these full applications is empty that
should be full of things okay well I
guess we'd better get in touch with them
so thanks for watching god subscribe
follow all that good stuff and see you
next time I just got an email back from
them
please stand by addressing your emails
with the engineer it's possible the raid
definitions were changed from one reboot
to the next because of drive letter
assignments and the Linux 26 was 2065
limit we have I think we have more than
26 devices in there I got another email
back - we recreated the block devices
please go ahead and check the videos and
content that you are looking at again no
way oh this is fence I'm not enjoying
this nothing there I'll let him know the
shares empty
this is just like the wildest roller
coaster ever
I don't even yeah I don't even have
anything else to say actually it's
almost funny I hope to some of you it's
funny here's the email I got 17 minutes
ago I was stuck on a call we got
everything remounted so you can now go
ahead and do the data once more this is
the moment do we not have a - I don't
think we ever had a - oh okay um okay so
let's go to that channel super fun video
that we were looking at yes yes way way
justing okay and it was the delivery
I'm getting like tingling okay okay you
got to check the source file Oh cuz that
was what we know was corrupted okay okay
okay okay so I'm transcoded footage
x-ray they did it
it's back oh my god it's back here's
another file its back do we have
everything in theory yes
really holy Sh
oh I think it's finally over that is
fantastic
hey guys guess what happened with the
recovery we got everything back goodness
like it's just been such a stressful few
weeks and that was just such a huge huge
thing all of our pitches and proposals
and stuff are on that server okay
Blahniks back bully really everything is
back as far as I can tell I have played
back video files they are not corrupted
Blahnik is officially back yeah swegway
jousting footage for the melee battle
should be fine
and we'll have a better backup scheme in
the future I promise that is all
yeah shot
we should physically print all of our
videos every frame I don't think so on
my paper you're the good news that want
ice pack Monica's back gay for hiring
other people to do our job I know I
don't think it's Beck but it is it's
back what are you doing I'm just letting
everyone know that Taryn it's back the
server's back okay so it's not always
that our sponsors tie so perfectly into
our content but today it happened
today's sponsor is Rackspace the top
tier manage cloud computing company they
pride themselves on best-in-class
service across all platforms they've got
over 300,000 customers in 120 countries
with 10 worldwide data centers they've
got Red Hat Cisco Microsoft VMware
certifications and all of that amounts
to whether you're running a small
business or a billion dollar enterprise
whatever your needs are in terms of
capacity storage or flash-based high
performance storage they can take care
of it without you going grey or bald
because you did something wrong and
screwed up a backup and went and lost a
raid array or whatever else they've got
dedicated storage to meet your
performance security network capacity
and compliance needs everything from
direct-attached storage so that gives
you the flexibility and scalability of
just a simple ok let's attach some
drives to this thing it's redundant cool
off you go to the races to fan so that's
high availability and reliability fully
redundant for business to even mass with
support for demanding workloads like
virtualization file sharing and rich
media in fact their nassif can scale up
to 20 petabytes of capacity they've got
private public cloud and private cloud
options as well and you can get your own
server a scaleable private cloud in the
data center in your data center in their
data center and it's all supported by
Rackspace and VMware they call their
support
fanatical because these people
are available 24 hours a day seven days
a week 365 days a year and they've got
industry-leading service level
agreements both managed and intensive so
if you need dedicated storage they got
you covered go to Rackspace comm /l tt
