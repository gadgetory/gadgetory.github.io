gtx 560 so for this trick I will require
an sous 120 Hertz 23.6 inch LCD monitor
capable of 3d vision okay so i'll need a
3d vision ready monitor 1080p i will
also need nvidia 3d vision glasses which
are here with a security device attached
them not that I stole them they came
with that okay i will also need a 3d
vision ready video card in this case i
actually have four different but these
are sort of similar 3d vision ready
video card so i have the gtx 580 which
retails for about 500 bucks i have the
gtx 560ti all do so I have a twin frozr
to version and i also have a reference
and vidya stock clocked version and then
last but not least i have a gtx 460 so
these guys retail around 250 to 280 and
this guy retails at a little bit lower
so it's kind of the last generation 560
TI so the point of this video is to show
you guys how these cards compare to each
other in a 1080p high detailed gaming 3d
environment well with 3d so stereoscopic
3d i only use a small cross section of
games but i'm going to test the 460 by
itself the 560 by itself five 60s in sli
because at that price point they're very
similar in price to a single 580 which i
will also be comparing because it is the
cream of the crop for single cards so
guys what i have on the test bench right
now is my duel gtx 560 s although i have
the driver configured right now so that
i'm only using one of them so i'm
testing its single 560 i'm testing 580
i'm testing duel for dual 560 TI s and
i'm also testing a 460 in order to find
out what's going to give the most
satisfactory 3d gaming experiences in my
test game
games here so this one I would consider
dual or single 560 not really playable
at 1080p remember i'm running four times
anti-aliasing 8 x AF i'm running
everything on max at 1080p and then it's
rendering it from two different angles
at the same time which is a lot more
demanding for the GPU so it's actually
quite challenging for me to do my run
through like this because the frame rate
is so well unsatisfactory but i'm doing
by i'm doing my best with it here so
that i can provide the results that you
guys want but anyway yeah so my graphs
are upcoming and i'm going to show you
guys how all these different configs are
going to perform with 3d vision which I
mean I've said it before and I'll say it
again is pretty much the most immersive
experience short of three divisions
surround that you can buy today oh my
goodness I'm not going to be able to
kill these guys yes I'd like that I'll
do try to awkward
you
so as you can see from the charts and
graphs the debt is pretty interesting
because the gtx 560ti is in sli do
outperform the single gtx 580 in two of
the tests whereas the gtx 580
outperforms the 560 TI s in one of the
3d vision tests so what that means to me
especially given the narrow margin of
victory for either solution is that
these are similar in performance in 3d
vision so what's interesting about that
though is that I actually found the 560
TI solution to be slightly less playable
that is the dips were lower and the
peaks were higher resulting in a similar
average frame rate by the less
satisfactory overall experience so what
I would probably choose for a purely 3d
vision gaming experience is the gtx 580
now this contrasts with the results that
I was able to achieve with the five 60s
in SLI in my other video where I was not
running stereoscopic 3d and the five 60s
despite their similar price point
actually destroyed the gtx 580 that is
in traditional 3d gaming that is not
stereoscopic and does not involve these
glasses so before we finish up here just
want to show you guys the test platform
that I used so I'm using an intel x25-m
80 gig SSD for my boot drive I'm using
an MS ip67 a GD 65 motherboard I'm using
an intel core i7 2608 processor it is
overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz so that I
can avoid as much as possible any CPU
bottlenecks and then I have eight gigs
of muskan redline ridgeback memory in
order to have memory for the system so
thank you for checking out my video on
the 3d vision gaming experience with the
geforce gtx 560ti</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
