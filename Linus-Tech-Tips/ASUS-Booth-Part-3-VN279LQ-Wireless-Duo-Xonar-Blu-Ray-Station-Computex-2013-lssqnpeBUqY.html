2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is Corsair
Vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM now we've showed a couple
thin bezel monitors over the last little
while but invariably we've ended up
disappointed because it turns out that
the speck that the manufacturers usually
talking about is the slimness of the
bezel but then often we're finding out
that they have glass front panels that
have a dead zone around it that makes
the effective bezel not really that much
different from any other monitor that's
out there this is a little bit different
this is the VN 2 7 9 ql b from asus and
if you think that that's a mouthful then
you're probably gonna think that the
image in front of you is an eyeful they
run at 1920 by 1080 and you can see that
there's a game running on them so these
are IPS panels but they are gaming
optimized and you might ask why would
they do that rather than go with a
faster TN panel and the answer is very
simple
these are 27-inch monitors which means
that they're big they're also designed
for gaming particularly in surround
gaming which means that they're going to
be really big TN does not have the
optimal viewing angles that would be
required to properly get the color
fidelity that you're going to need for
an enjoyable immersive gaming experience
once you surround yourself with these
because you won't be able to look
directly at every single panel that is
why it has been changed now let's have a
look at just how slim it is I'll do my
trademark cell phone thickness
comparison here so you can see it is
slightly slimmer on the top and the
sides about the thickness of an HTC One
R and then on the bottom there is a
little bit of extra space for the
buttons so there's a power input you
know brightness all those usual
adjustments that you see but unlike some
of the other monitors we've seen in the
past with slim bezels as well it's not a
dramatic difference I remember the last
time I did a five by one portrait
display setup on NCIX tech tips we were
using a monitor that had a top bezel
about like this and a bottom bezel about
like that because they had like a
speaker on it or something I was like
well that's not very optimal so this is
looking to change that it's gonna be
available in a couple
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
time to move on to the next cool thing
yet another product here at the Asus
booth so this is the wireless duo you
can get it in either a 500 gig or one
terabyte capacity and there's a couple
different colors and it's got some
unique features compared to other
wireless hard drives so first of all
we've got a USB 3 interface which ok
that's not particularly unique next
we've got and these are dummy models so
don't mind the fit and finish next we've
got an SD card reader so what's cool
about this is you can actually hook up
your SD card you just plug in your SD
card and there's a OneTouch backup you
can see on the interface right down here
on the tablet all you have to do is
click SD yep there you go click OK and
you can do a OneTouch backup on that
next up on the unit itself you see not a
whole lot except that it's actually
pretty much sealed so it is not quite
something that you'd call waterproof to
the point where you throw it in a puddle
but it is water resistant and splash
proof so you don't have to worry too
much about okay you've got your your
wireless Drive in your backpack you're
riding around on your bike in the rain
and if a little bit of rain gets through
you don't have to worry about ok the
things just gonna die out right so
they've got apps available for iOS 5 and
above Android 2.3 and above as well as
Kindle Fire obviously it works with
Windows and Mac as well and I just want
to show you guys uh here we go how
snappy the interface is because if
you've seen any of these wireless
devices before you'll know that they're
not always the fastest thing in the
world now it should be noted we're in
the middle of a crowded crowded show
floor where there are tons of wireless
devices an extremely interference ridden
environment but in spite of that the
performance of it is what I would
consider completely acceptable so you
can see it is managing 200 every time
you try and demo something it burns you
but there you go
now it's buffering ahead of the playback
speed of the actual content itself not
only that but there's some other cool
features in here as well so it supports
music playback while you are actually
viewing big art photo files for example
and this is cool so it's got full
support for flack media files as well
and I've lost track of where those files
were so you'll have
take my word for it but hold on music
whatever we'll just play something else
so you can change your music playback to
either the condensed one or a full
screen if you want to check out your
album art and this should be coming
when's this coming you guys I put
everyone on the spot
apparently July but don't take my word
for it
convergence truly is the name of the
game and I'm about to go about that two
different ways so number one is the
problem with convergence is everyone
wants smaller and smaller devices to the
point where they do everything but they
don't necessarily do everything well so
notebooks two of the things that due to
the trends are that it's becoming more
and more difficult to fit an optical
drive into a notebook form factor in a
way that will be appealing to a customer
and number two is that notebooks have
notoriously terrible onboard audio
solutions
so this is where convergence hurts us
but where it helps us is when we get
all-in-one devices that can take some of
the best engineering talents of a
company like someone like a Seuss and
turn it into one product so this is the
zonar blu-ray station which actually
seeks to address that problem so number
one it is is it as a high quality hence
the zone our branding that you're gonna
find on the right side of it here it is
a high quality external sound card so
we're talking headphone amps up to 16 RS
has a headphone amp so it can handle
headphones up to 600 ohms of impedance
a/c media audio processor as well as a
cirrus logic deck around at the back
you're gonna find a wide variety of
different audio output options including
analog as well as digital output so it
is a USB 3 interface to the computer
itself and it does require external
power in order to deliver the power you
need for that amplitude as well as an
optical drive so it can turn your
notebook pretty much into a higher
quality sound solution as well as a
blu-ray playback station that can
support as you can see here in the demo
itself a surround sound audio system as
well so it takes that notebook that
wasn't really good at those things and
is an all-in-one solution blu-ray
reading blu-ray writing external audio
and
the nation of all of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
