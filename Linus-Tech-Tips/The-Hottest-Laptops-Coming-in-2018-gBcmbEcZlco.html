Some from some strange brands, and the others from the big companies.
But which ones did we think are best?
Well
These five in no particular order
Brought to you by Intel
Up first is the new Gram from LG
With the 13-inch model coming in at just 965 grams, this laptop is insanely light
But also surprisingly robust
In our review of the late 2017 model
We had said if they added Thunderbolt 3 and change the location of the camera
It could be basically the perfect laptop
And they did both things
So with a quad core 8th generation Intel processor
Increased battery capacity
Due to the 72 hour battery
And a fingerprint sensor that's been moved into the on off button
This might be the laptop to beat for ultra portables
Speaking of portable if you have a little less space in your backpack
But you can take a bit more weight
At just 8.98 millimeters
The Acer Swift 7 is Insanely thin
Looking at it from the side it almost disappears
But somehow they kept the keyboard feel excellent and suprisingly long
The only thing you're compromising here is the 7th generation Intel processor
Seems that dual-core is still alive in super thin laptops
But you could be forgiven if you trade the power if the laptop looks like this
If you can't sacrifice power, take a look at this laptop from Dell
The completely new XPS 13
Not only has 24% less volume
But a staggering 80% more power
It features an Intel 8th generation quad core processor
That they've been able to merge with some clever cooling system for longer turbo boosts
The build quality remains impeccable
It uses the same keyboard as the outgoing model
Which is a good thing
And with a 4k HDR option available for the screen
It's very nice to look at too
Moving on to Dells XPS 15
Well now, that is a two-in-one laptop, and there are a lot of cool things about this laptop
It not only has an Intel 8th generation processor, but built into the CPU package
It has RX Vega and graphics
This means a massive increase in graphical performance
Making it perfect for things like Photoshop and light video editing
Now it's not the thinnest laptop we've ever seen
But it's still respectable at 16 millimeters
And to help achieve this thinness with two-in-one folding functionality
Dell actually developed a new type of keyboard switch
Which they're calling Maglev
This allows a surprisingly clicky feel in what would otherwise be a very restrictive amount of space
And Oh continuing with the trend of magnets
There's also a magnetic pen for people who like that
Moving on we've got the Lenovo x1 carbon
Now this isn't really a new laptop
But we feel like the new model steps it up with a lot of nice-to-haves
These additions include &quot;Windows hello facial recognition&quot;
Up to a 1440p panel with HDR support
Although unfortunately touch is only available on the 1080p model
And a quad-core Intel processor
And your fingers actually get treated to a luxurious 1.8. Millimeters of key travel
With excellent tactile feel
As well as a whole heap of &quot;I/O&quot; to prevent you from the embarrassment of forgetting the right dongle for your meeting
And this is all wrapped up in a premium feeling chassis that I imagine will keep going for years
And even though that's five already we actually we have one honorable mention
The MSI radar GE-63
We weren't allowed to know what processor was in it
But we know it's new
We know it's from Intel
And we're really pumped for whatever is new about this
So thanks for checking out this video of our top 5 Intel laptops from CES 28s [blabbers]
