Master featuring the site and 240
millimeter all in one cpu water cooling
system check it out at www.pay 7 so
their tagline for this guy is a new
legend is born and I believe that has
something to do with the fact that this
board is now the host of law at least
when they printed the box these things
change all the time but is now the host
of the world sorry for that noise of the
world record seven point 10 2 gigahertz
overclock on a 3770k so there you go
they've got a little badge on their box
to tell you all about how the
overclocking features of this board are
not one of those all show and no go type
affairs but actually delivering results
in the competitive overclocking scene so
we're going to go ahead and we see the
board first but I'm going to make you
guys sit through the accessories before
we actually check it out lots of
accessories there are many many
accessories so accessory number one is
their pci express bluetooth and Wi-Fi
card go ahead and give you guys a look
at this what's cool about this is you
actually don't have to use it on
gigabyte boards you can use it on a
different board should you so desire so
you can carry that with you as your
system evolves and changes over
potentially the years ok so there's the
antennas that go with them they're just
little stand alone antennas you stick
them wherever you want next up we've got
all of the connectivity this board does
support 4-way SLI so it comes with a
4-way SLI bridge a 3-way SLI bridge a
two-way flexible crossfire bridge and
presumably there we go a two-way
flexible SLI bridge all of these are
black which means they will actually go
with your computer color scheme whereas
I've seen sort of brutal ones in the
past that don't match the board that you
actually bought it with we've also got
lead outs for the voltage monitoring
that is built into the board you don't
have to solder anything as well as a USB
cable that is I believe for the Wi-Fi
Bluetooth card it comes with a three and
a half inch front USB 3
Bay so if your case doesn't have USB 3
natively you can add it no problem it
also comes with one of their I want two
gigabytes awesome esata brackets so that
goes in a pci bracket and includes a
molex power connector and then they also
include a molex to duel SATA internal
SATA adapter so you can just plug in to
external drives easily just to the back
of your system without any extra
adapters or enclosures or anything like
that you just plug them in and go
finally we've got six 8036 gigabit per
second cables three right angle and
three straight and i/o shield there you
go color coded for your convenience and
all the manuals and whatnot that you
will need poor now let's get into the
board itself so gigabyte really is
throwing everything at this board in
terms of technology whether it's
performance related cooling related or
even looks related it looks really
really sharp just like many of their
other OC boards and give me a moment to
get this adjusted so I can actually show
you guys what it looks like this is not
an XL ATX board which I personally like
to see I want to see that functionality
put into a form factor that most cases
can actually accept but they've still
managed to make it 4-way SLI and
four-way cross fire compatible now the
problem with z77 boards that are able to
run for way configurations is that
usually they use bridge chips that while
they increase the bandwidth available to
the slots I can have a negative impact
on latency so if you're going to run a
single graphics card configuration what
you would want to do is use this black
port right here very innovative very
cool approach from gigabyte this black
port goes natively directly to the CPU
pcie 16x and will have no additional
latency involved so you only have to use
these orange ports if you're running
dual graphics awesome love to see it
cooling wise they've changed up the
approach a little bit we've seen a lot
of cooling solutions implemented on
motherboards that are more for show
rather than for the actual thermal
dissipation remember it's all about
surface area so the cooler on here uses
a very thin dent heatsink arrangement in
order to dissipate more heat to the
server
pounding air and not necessarily just be
four looks so there's one for the
Southbridge area one for the Northbridge
area and then one around the 32 phase
power design so that is part of what
allows the CPU to get such stable power
however just throwing more power phases
at a board is not necessarily going to
improve the performance in any
meaningful way you actually have to
build good phases so gigabyte is using
the same IO are truly all digital PWM so
there's nothing analog left in the power
delivery system that is actually on the
board that i'm using the x79 su p 5
which is an x 79 board whereas this is a
z77 to a different socket otherwise I'd
probably consider using something like
this and that is how you're able to push
the clocks up on those CPUs even under
extreme conditions such as extremely low
temperature which is required for
boosting things up to that level anyway
so in terms of the actual connectors on
the board we've got two 8-pin CPU
connectors up here at the top left in
their ideal locations one 24-pin
connector over here on the far right in
its ideal location front USB 3 is on the
right-hand edge of the board as well as
the bottom so depending which approach
you prefer you can definitely go ahead
and leverage either of those it includes
an msata port so slot by our port 5 over
here will be disabled if you use it
personally for a desktop system I'd
usually just add a an SSD or a drive
rather than using msata but there you go
you have the option auxiliary power is
provided by a SATA connector here I do
recommend using this if you're going to
install three graphics cards or more
we've got six say 236 gigabit per second
ports these two are powered by Intel
these two are powered by marvel chipset
and then for say two to three gigabit
per second ports there's the debug LED
as well as controls for the main BIOS as
well as the secondary bile so it does
have a dual BIOS system with hardware
switches allowing you to decide which
one you want to boot from your front
panel connectors are here this red USB
port supports on/off which is cool
because your devices will charge whether
it's a phone or a tablet even if your
computer is powered off and your front
panel audio is right over here the board
suppler includes support for the latest
core i3 i5 and i7 processors on the LGA
1155 platform so
our seven on board fan headers 12 PWM up
here at the top a third PWM here on the
right-hand side a fourth fifth and fifth
PWM down here on the bottom and then two
three pin connectors down here on the
bottom so that means you can control all
these fans through the bios rather than
using a third-party controller or
whatever else I mean this is the stuff
that I glazed over because it seems
basic now but lga1155 does support up to
four dims of dual-channel ddr3 memory
with up to eight gig dims so you can put
in a total of 32 gigs of ram should you
so desire this board does feature the
latest ultra durable technology meaning
the 2x copper PCB as well as their new
fiberglass hourglass fabric rather not
fiberglass glass fabric PCD which is
humidity resistant so it's going to be
great for damp environments where
there's lots of humidity in the air as
well as sort of other regular
environments little nice touches like
this I like to see so they got more
cooling on the back of the board for the
MOSFETs and that will help particularly
with chassis such as the enttec 1,100
where it there's actually sort of space
on the back where some airflow can come
through as well as using screws for all
the built-in heat sinks it means they're
not likely to come loose and travel or
if there's any if the board undergoes
any kind of a flex they'll stay on and
the board will actually function as
intended so I think that pretty much
wraps it up I mean there's okay there's
other weird stuff that I okay so you
guys can tune out if you're not
interested in the crazy stuff so here's
where all the voltage checkpoints are so
if you're doing any kind of crazy over
voltage that's where you can measure
them directly with a multimeter rather
than relying on software here's where
you can switch to liquid nitrogen mode
clear CMOS switches up here power as
well as overclocking buttons so these
are for directly overclocking the board
they have a hardware interface with the
board so you don't have to worry about
any software and then these this gear
button actually changes the increments
that these buttons use to overclock the
board itself those reset switch is away
from all the other switches for whatever
reason is down here in the bottom right
corner I guess that's for ease of access
when it's on a bench since reset is the
one that you're typically using a lot in
that scenario and of course the rear i/o
which I completely forgot to actually
been a long time since I've done a
motherboard unboxing we haven't had a
new play
form in quite a while I am three plus
and LGA 1155 have been with us forever
