the forum by Ashley ashes who asked the
rest of our community if you could use
laptop memory in a desktop system it
turns out you can get adaptors unlike
eBay but is that really gonna work only
one way to find out private Internet
access is the VPN service that encrypts
all your Internet traffic and uses a
safe protected IP it's got tons of other
useful features as well so check it out
now at the link below alright so let's
start I guess by taking a closer look at
these things they're made by I believe
the company is actually called jet and
this is their part number you can
actually get them in a wide variety of
different configurations these ones we
found on eBay and are designed for ddr4
sodium's to a ddr4 full-sized DIMM now
you might think to yourself well what's
to not work about this I can put a micro
sd card into a and full size SD adapter
no one's bewildered and baffled by this
but the reason this is such a big deal
is come in and have a closer look
sodium's are a 200 contact point
standard full-sized imps actually have
288 so on here we've got a couple of
different things we've got
whatever-the-hell a virtual fuses
apparently it's patented we've got a
jumper I mean there's no manual
obviously so I'm gonna assume the
defaults are all right so let's shut
down and while I wait for Windows Update
apparently let's talk about the
challenge and show you guys how to
install it I already put together one of
them but you want to kind of go in at an
angle like that push it down make sure
everything's in there fully then you put
a little bit of tension on it just like
that now I am actually asking more from
the adapter I want to see a couple of
things I want to see if we can get these
to run in quad channel with the existing
30 200 megahertz ddr4 that's on this
platform and I want to see if I can get
the whole thing to still run it 30 200
megahertz because it's one thing if you
can get memory you know working and
recognized it's another if this adapter
is not interfering with its performance
that looks ridiculous you know we've had
conversations internally about how hard
it is to build an ugly computer these
days now that every motherboard has a
black PCB and and all that kind of stuff
but by Jove I think we've done it okay
let's see what happens did we fail
already post code 55
well then code 55 means no RAM installed
which is fairly discouraging because
there definitely is RAM installed even
aside from these sodium to dim adapters
so I'm gonna try reseeding them go go go
and then firing it up again balls no
okay I'm gonna try the memo okay button
I've never used it successfully shot
Brendan
okay let's try clear CMOS there we're
gonna try next is pulling out the
mismatched memory I mean admittedly that
was a bit of a long shot in the first
place
okay here we go that's very interesting
16 gigs of memory let's get it booted up
so fire up task manager we've got all 16
gigs of our memory it knows that they're
so dim so I don't know if it's reading
that off the SPD chip or if that mean it
must be it must because how about
Windows have any way of knowing ok so
we're just finishing up the i-264 cache
and memory benchmark and there's a
couple more interesting things here we
are in fact running in dual channel mode
so that's good
but only at stock speeds not the higher
XMP speeds of our modules and also
interesting is that our reading right
numbers look about like you'd expect
from ddr4 2133 in dual channel mode this
is weird
so our memory is showing up as ddr4 20
400 megahertz but I don't know where
it's reading that from because these
adaptors shouldn't have any logic on
them whatsoever but but there you have
it it's set but when we were in the
operating system just now I didn't
change anything we were at 21 33 so
here's what we're gonna do we're not
gonna try and run at 3,800 that's not
realistic but let's try sort of
high-speed like 3000 megahertz and see
if we can get there mm-hmm
it's looping right now you can tell cuz
we keep going through the same sequence
of postcodes here okay let's try
something a little less aggressive 26 66
megahertz wouldn't be like a performance
memory kit or anything when this was
current but like it would be decent
middle-of-the-road hey there we go
alright so this is moment of truth time
what we want to see is if going from
2133 to 2666 gives us an improvement yes
it does okay not bad so you won't be
running at the bleeding edge but you
should expect it to work bringing us to
what is often the most challenging part
of these kinds of videos where you know
it's like yeah you could adapt your
trailer hitch to a office chair you can
but should you so this thing then no one
should go out of their way to use one of
these if you've got a desktop you should
buy desktop memory and install desktop
memory in it and if you've got a laptop
and well you there's no adapter the
other way around because a full-sized am
physically wouldn't wouldn't
in there but I can see situations where
they could come in handy like let's say
for example that you've got an older
laptop that you're looking to upgrade
well a lot of them might come with you
know to eight gig sticks in them and
then you might go okay well I don't want
16 gigs I want 32 in order to upgrade it
you've got to go buy two new 16 gig
sticks and then you've got to take out
your old ones so if you were looking to
give those parts a new lease on life
two Jet's credit I actually don't even
know who makes these things to their
credit these are inexpensive and from
our testing while not high-performance
functional so not recommended to need
them but recommend it if you need them
to go ahead and pick them up speaking of
going ahead and picking something up why
not picking up a subscription to fresh
books fresh books is the online
cloud-based accounting solution that
makes it easier to run your small
business or freelance operation you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments to get paid up to
four days faster you can see when your
client has seen your invoice to put an
end to the guessing games once and for
all and you can track your expenses you
can log your hours and you can do those
things while you're on the go which is
really cool there Android and iOS apps
are fully featured with all the
functionality of the desktop platform so
don't take my word for it try fresh
books for free for 30 days by going to
fresh ebooks.com slash tech tips and
