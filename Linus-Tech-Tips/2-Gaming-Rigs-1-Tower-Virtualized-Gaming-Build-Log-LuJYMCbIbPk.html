can't do that actually yes we can and
today we're gonna be showing you guys
step-by-step how to build a single Tower
that can run two independent gaming rigs
complete with their own keyboards mice
and even video cards out of the same box
off the same motherboard and the same
CPU even so hit that like button if you
guys are super amped on this topic and
stay tuned this is going to be a wild
ride
so let's start with the inspiration for
this build coolermaster came to us and
they were like hey we want a sponsor
like a a bill that you guys do in the
mastercase 5 it's all modular and
there's upgradeable parts and you can
like put a lot of hard drives in or you
could not put a lot of hard drives in
you could put them out of board in or
lots of graphics cards or just a few
graphics cards you can build like
anything you want in there use your
imagination I was kind of like okay well
my imagination is that I've always kind
of wanted to do like something with
virtualization and like two gaming rigs
running off of one computer because when
you think about it looking at the rest
of the hardware we're using here and we
do this all the time we build like these
super overpowered machines with like
eight processing cores 32 gigs of RAM
we've got like enough USB ports to choke
a stallion you got two graphics cards
you throw a couple SSDs and a couple
hard drives and you go well holy crap
you got like two computers worth of
hardware in the thing why can't you just
legitimately run two computers off of it
so that is exactly what we'll be doing
so our hardware list is a coolermaster
mastercase pro 5 we've got a v8 50 power
supply with an Epson 240 M water cooler
we're using an Asus x99 deluxe
motherboard with an 8 core Core i7 59 60
X Extreme Edition 32 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx memory we've got a GTX
Titan X a GTX 780 Ti and some of this is
a ninety 500 GS okay I'll explain why we
need that later as well as two Intel 730
series 480 gig SSDs and two Seagate
three terabyte hard drives and what are
the hard drives for for a gaming rig
great question we are going to be
putting not one not two but three
operating systems on this machine two
copies of Windows 10 and one copy of
lime tech unreadable be a Nath's
and it will be two gaming rigs at the
same time so let's start by building the
machine so the biggest way that we
leverage the modularity of the
mastercase 5 was to
reconfigure the drive cages our plan was
to use two SSDs and two hard drives
which gave us a lot of space in the
front of the case for a large water
cooling system however in the event that
we wanted more emphasis on the NAS
portion of our build and we wanted to
have a lot more hard drives for storage
we could easily use a different cooler
weather mounted in the rear or the top
or just an air cooler on the CPU and
fill up the front of the case with
drives okay so that wasn't the most
detailed physical build guide we've ever
done but it wasn't intended to be the
hard part today is component selection
and software configuration so if you
want to know more about how this case
works and all of its modularity then
check out the review video that we did
here no we're gonna talk about why we
picked the other parts that we did first
number one you will need a CPU with
virtualization technology so this will
be called VT - D which is being able to
pass through a PCI device to a virtual
machine very important for passing
through our video cards and the second
is V T - X and this is all applying to
Intel CPUs and that is the ability to
support virtualization at all step
number two configure your graphics cards
appropriately for each gaming machine
that you want to run off of your
computer you will need one dedicated
gaming capable graphics card then in
addition to that you will need another
GPU for on raid to initialize when it's
booting up so this could be your onboard
graphics or in our case we installed a
9500 GS and this is important in the top
PCI Express slot for it to grab number
three is other devices that you want
each machine to have access to in our
case both of our monitors are going to
have support for an audio pass-through
jack on the bottom of the monitor so we
can use the HDMI or DisplayPort audio
off of our graphics card if we wanted to
run USB sound cards that would be an
option as well and would give both
players the ability to use microphone
USB headsets could work as well but
with any USB devices you may have
noticed our peripherals are all
completely different you will have to
use different models of USB devices more
on this later
and finally for storage we've gone with
two SSDs this gives us redundancy
effectively raid one of high enough
capacity that you can split the capacity
between the two machines so our two 480
gig drives are actually turning into 240
gigs per box of redundant safe storage
and then our hard drives again we've
gone with two hard drives because if you
go with more than two then you're going
to hurt your right performance and
failover if one drive dies all the data
is there through butter FS is enough for
us for these purposes and we'd like to
have the additional right speed we can
do about a hundred plus megabytes per
second to our array so two hard drives
for redundancy again high enough
capacity that we can effectively split
them getting one and a half terabytes of
redundant storage per virtual machine
step number one format your USB Drive in
fat32 calling it on raid in all caps
download the latest version of on read
off of the lime - technology comm
website copy all of the files from your
download onto your formatted USB disk
then right click make bootable and run
as administrator and press Enter you can
now eject your USB and put it into your
computer step 2 make sure you're running
the latest bios for your motherboard
change all SATA devices to a HCI mode
and enable virtualization technology in
our case it was under advanced CPU
configuration and advanced system agent
configuration within the BIOS now what
you can do is use your boot override to
boot to the USB Drive that you just
created once the system's booted up
navigate to HTTP colon slash slash tower
in the internet browser of another
computer on the same network at this
stage you can decide whether you want to
purchase a key or get a trial key which
is limit
two three storage devices and stops
working after 60 days it's a good way to
try it out though step 4
hit info in the top right and double
check to make sure that hvm and iommu
are enabled if they're not you may need
to reconfigure something in your
motherboard BIOS to get your
virtualization running with that out of
the way go to main change your hard
drive slots to something lower add your
two hard drives using the dropdowns to
parity and disk one then change your
cache slots we're using these for our
SSDs - - and add both of the SSDs to
cache drives next go to tools then
system devices make sure your devices
are showing up correctly we're looking
for our graphics cards anything that
starts with 0 0 is built into the
motherboard while things that start with
other numbers or letters are generally
going to be discrete devices so here we
can see all three of our graphics cards
are showing up correctly note this PCI
device number at the beginning here this
will be important for the next step now
scroll down to iommu groups find those
devices so in our case here we are here
are video cards and ensure that they are
showing up in separate groups if they're
not you may need to enable a workaround
but fortunately thanks to the way that
Isis has implemented things on this
motherboard they are all showing up in
separate groups and it will be easy to
assign these devices to separate VMs
next go to settings and identification
here we can change the name of our
server which is how it'll show up on the
network so I'm going to call it on Linus
and with this change made we're going to
have to renew 8 to our administration
console I would also recommend at this
stage navigating to users and adding a
password to the root user so that not
just anyone can dink around in the
administration console next go to
settings then network settings and
change obtain IP address automatically
to know it's recommended
just for the sake of ease of use later
on down the road that you set a static
IP so that it's easy to navigate to this
administration consult from another
computer on the network now go back to
main and start the array once you see
the green array started in the bottom
left hand corner click the yes I want to
do this button next to format and click
format it'll take a while for your
drives to format and the more drives you
have the longer it'll take
now that our format is complete go to
shares and we are actually going to
create using the add share button for
different shares note carefully the
settings that we're using for them and
replicate these exactly our iso's share
is for installing our VMS and the
associated drivers our V disks share is
for the boot drives of our VMs they are
running purely on SSD our docker folder
is for if we want to add applications
like Plex server to our unraised server
install as opposed to our Windows VMs
and our final share our AV disks is for
mass storage drives that are on the hard
drives for our virtual machines now go
to settings VM manager change enable VMs
to yes change the ISO library to your
ISO directory that you just created
change the default Network Bridge to be
r0 then press apply you'll know this
worked because you'll see a VMs tab at
the top next go to the VMS tab and click
add vm name your vm and give it a
description and if you want it to
automatically boot up when you fire up
on raid then change auto start to yes
select the appropriate operating system
for Windows 10 you can select Windows
8.1 and that will work just fine and
change from basic view to advanced view
select the number of course you want for
your VM in our case we're going to pick
8 of our virtual course so that's for
real course and for hyper-threaded ones
and then select how much memory you want
for your vm I'm gonna give each of my
VMs around 12 gigs of RAM don't change
max memory just initial no
to obtain an operating system install
ISO for Windows 10 you can simply
download it from Microsoft and copy it
to the ISOs folder then for your Verte I
O drivers ISO click this link and use
the forth download so latest Verte ISO
win ISO and copy that directly to the
iso's folder on your network in our case
we can type backslash backslash on linus
and navigate to is OS with those
downloaded we can select them in the
drop down and set a primary v disk
location in this case user v disks
choose a primary v disk size I'm gonna
go with 200 gigs press the plus button
then select for the location user array
V disks and for size well let's make it
one terabyte and change your graphics
card to the one that you desire for this
particular VM we're gonna make this our
Titan X machine for sound choose the
corresponding Nvidia device in the drop
down or if you add additional sound
cards then you can definitely do that as
well make sure your network bridge is
the one that you created before and
finally select the peripherals you're
going to be using for this particular VM
once you're ready click create and the
VM will start as soon as it's finished
being created and this my friends is
where the magic happens within a couple
seconds you should see the screen
illuminate and your windows install
should begin just as it would if you
were installing on a normal computer
okay not quite normal
you will need to load a driver so simply
browse and go to your Verte io vio store
the corresponding copy of windows so 8.1
for 10 and then the appropriate
architecture so we're running 64-bit and
install your storage device driver
once that's done you should see both of
your storage devices show up and you can
install to your SSD storage device once
you're dumped on the desktop there are a
few more drivers you'll need to install
so go to device manager and there should
be
three exclamation mark items update
driver software browse and go to your
vert I Oh
disk press okay include subfolders and
click Next repeat this process for each
of them once that's done install your
Nvidia graphics card drivers from Nvidia
comm and you are pretty much ready to go
you can create your second virtual
machine in exactly the same way with the
one exception being that you'll need to
change your CPU course to course that
you didn't already use for this virtual
machine in cases where you want to
install some additional applications on
unread itself you may want to reserve
one or two cores for unread and leave
the rest of them allocated to your
virtual machines there are a couple of
more Pro tips put your PC in high
performance mode disable fastboot sleep
and hibernation and there's a guide over
on the guru 3d forums that you'll need
to follow especially if you've got an
Nvidia graphics card and you're using
the onboard audio to ensure that your
audio doesn't get garbled it is a
registry hack but it's not too
complicated to follow along so this is
it my friends moment of truth time both
of our VMs are set to start up
automatically once the system is powered
on so in theory within about a minute or
so we're gonna have Windows 10 running
twice on one computer so on raid takes a
little while to boot up give her a
minute you know oh there goes okay my
two virtual machines are starting
other side oh oh this one's already on
the desktop yes my friends there you
have it
mouse keyboard star wars battlefront
beta this is kind of it this is the Star
Wars Battlefront beta running at ultra
details 1080p on two virtual machines on
the same box at a hundred and six FPS on
this one and a hundred and four FPS on
this one yes we are getting full
discrete performance on two instances of
the game simultaneously so now that
we've gotten this far I mean what's the
fun of having a dual headed gaming box
if you don't have somebody to enjoy it
with let's go get Luke do you like
bounce around when I think it'll show
you like a cone of where they are which
is red but then it'll also show you like
thread shapes or there's one left behind
something like the rocks or whatever is
said about home they take a sec to pull
up
do you have regenerating health in this
thing yes yeah I got an empty vehicle
turret cool and a proximity bottom oh
this guy has a concealed then in jetpack
so that was fun and to my eye I can't
tell that I'm running on a virtual
machine but without objective
measurements I can't quantify the
difference for you guys so I've actually
got Luke running our standardized
battlefront benchmark which was used in
our performance roundup which you guys
will actually be able to check out and I
think one or two days depending on how
the release schedule goes to validate
how our 980ti mind you it's running on
three CPU physical cores versus it was
running on a six core in there
stacks up against running it on a
dedicated machine and I think the number
should be with us any moment here there
we go
so this is running on a 59 60 X versus
on a 59 30 K which is actually a higher
clock speed chip not to mention that it
has all six of its cores versus only
three of them and the 980ti scored 120
FPS average we got 100 and 2.5 FPS
average I am feeling pretty frakking
good about those results and this is at
1080p ultra so guys thank you for
