PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more now NVIDIA never sends me
boxes so I put the GTX 760 in an old box
that I had lying around also from Nvidia
but it was for an older card this is the
third in the GeForce 700 series of cards
so we've seen the 780 as well as the 770
already but the 760 comes in to replace
the outgoing 660ti in that all-important
$250 price point so there's been quite a
few tweaks over the older 660ti it still
uses that same GK 104 core that we've
come to know and trust from the previous
generation cards but there have been a
few tweaks number one is clock speeds
have been increased the old 660ti had a
boost clock of 980 megahertz whereas the
760 has a base clock of 980 goes all the
way up to 1033 megahertz and that is
running at stock speeds for this card
next up is it has 32 ro PS that is
raster operators versus 24 hour piece
what those do is they are more sort of
oomph later on in the graphics rendering
pipeline aiding in things like
anti-aliasing that are done close to the
end of the processing of the image that
goes on okay last but not least we get a
wider memory bus so we've gone from a
192 bit interface on the old card to a
256 bit interface on the new gtx 760
that isn't to say that everything has
been increased though the gtx 760 has
1152 cuda cores versus 1344 cuda cores
in the old 660ti so check out our
performance review where we're really
going to dive into the performance of
this card versus the one is replacing
but some things have been upgraded and
some things have been taken away and we
end up with a very interesting part here
one other thing about this card is that
because it's a 256 bit bus card you can
have a 2 gig or a four gig configuration
depending on the manufacturer versus
three gigs max on the 660ti now when I
talk about the card physically there's
not really that much to say because
we've got the traditional blower style
shroud that we
see with Nvidia graphics cards we've got
that silence optimized fan with the new
acoustic profile that's cool that's new
with 700 series as well as Titan that
keeps it from ramping up you know when
it's close to a threshold but it wants
to maintain we've got that same dual DVI
HDMI and DisplayPort output at the back
that gives us Nvidia 3d vision surround
with three monitors and one auxiliary
monitor PCI Express 3.0 nvidia sli
support up to three way with two sli
fingers on the top of the card and we've
got that PCB extension part at the back
here that makes the card nine inches
total in length now the reason they did
that is that there's not enough room to
have the heatsink itself over the GPU
and then a fan next to it unless you
actually extend the card a little bit so
in order to maintain that blower style
that's what they've done on the back of
the card we've got some of the RAM chips
whereas the other half are on the other
half of the card and that is pretty much
it it's got a clean aesthetic with a
geforce gtx branding present on the top
as well as two 6-pin PCI Express
connectors and when I say all important
250 dollar price point what am I talking
about I used to work at a retailer so I
know that that's where most people are
spending their money somewhere between
149 and 249 so when Nvidia says weapon
of choice they're talking about that
gamer who doesn't have the money for a
tightener gtx 680 they just want to run
the latest games at high settings at
1080p or 1920 by 1200 and get a great
experience so the example that they're
using is Metro last light with this card
versus previous generation cards such as
an older 275 that would have been in a
similar price range
now you can crank up Metro last light
whereas with your older card you
couldn't and it's all about delivering
that consistent experience speaking of
experience GeForce experience is of
course supported so shadow play is
coming soon meaning it uses the onboard
h.264 encoder in order to record your
gameplay on-the-fly more on that in an
upcoming video for sure as well as
automatic driver updates as well as
recommendations for what settings you
can run all of your games at speaking of
games we've got upcoming games that are
going to be meant to be played on
GeForce titles so we've got ahem
Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag watchdogs
Blin Tercel blacklist witcher 3
End batman arkham origins that are all
coming up optimized for geforce right
out of the gate and when it comes to
performance
2:49 is an aggressive price point when
you consider that this GPU at this kind
of the level was not available below
around $2.99 so with the 660ti being at
a higher price in the last generation of
card so we are definitely seeing some
trickle down in terms of the price with
performance being maintained or even
improved versus the last gen card and
compared to something like a 79 50 i
think we're going to find that 760 is a
very competitive card but hey don't take
my word for it in the unboxing because i
haven't tested it yet i'm just unboxing
it so check out our 1080p performance
review of the gtx 760 don't forget to
like this video as well as leave a
comment about what you think of the gtx
760 Are you disappointed by invidious
latest card do you think it's fantastic
let us know under the video we do read
those comments share the video if you
thought it was great and as always guys
