and H 67 Sandy Ridge ready motherboards
over the last little while but I haven't
looked at many M ATX ones so this is a
reasonably high performance looking m8
exp 67 motherboards supporting all the
latest Intel LGA 1155 CPUs that is core
i3 s core i5s in core i7s it is AP 67
chipset motherboard which means that it
does not support the onboard video of
these CPUs but it does support their
unlocked performance of the K series
processor so you can overclock K series
chips on this board we've got their EP
you chip which is for energy saving
we've got SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
we've got USB 3.0 UEFI graphical BIOS
and I think that's pretty much all
they've got to say for themselves on the
front let's see what asus has on the
back so they're TPU which is for more
performance EQ which is for energy
savings okay we've got some other stuff
here what do we got
hmm three protective Plato which is
basically lower power consumption to
protect the environment lower
electromagnetic emissions to protect you
and yeah hold on I'm thinking because I
don't see it in here yes something about
stabilizing power spikes to protect your
motherboard I don't think that's here
but that's what protect the point is a I
suite 2 which is their software and the
EFI BIOS let's have a look at the board
like I said this looks like a pretty
high performance board and comes with
what appears to be a pretty high
performance package so let's see we've
got our user's guide we've got Anna sue
sticker and we've also bought Anna sue
software DVD so throw that away download
latest from the assist website you've
got two SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
cables both of them right angle and 2
SATA 2 3 gigabit per second cables those
are both right angle as well please no
better than the colour difference
there's no difference between those
cables they are both fine so we've got Q
connectors which are an easier way of
plugging in your front panel connectors
as well as your front USB and this is
what made me think this is a performance
board because they bought their extra
patting on the i/o shield you only
really see that you know on higher
performance cords from a suit it's true
I'll tell you all right we've got their
environmentally friendly packaging the
only paper good and we've got a
motherboard
all right pretty nice looking board
overall actually I can say that with
confidence right off the bat and you
know I'm so happy to see more and more
of this all the time PCI Express for one
thing and high-density of PCI Express
slots on em ATX board so this board
fully supports SLI and CrossFireX
so this one runs it's okay you know
it'll get to that later okay we've got
our 1155 socket which is compatible like
I said with all the latest processors
don't try and put in 1156 chip in there
and will not work we've got an 8 pin
power connector we've got some pretty
nice-looking Wave style MOSFET heat
sinks around that CPU socket they're
nice and low profile though here you can
see that from the side so you shouldn't
have any trouble with any of your tower
heat sinks or whatever kind of heatsink
you want to install on here we've got
four sticks of dual channel ddr3 memory
compatibility capability and this is the
easy install kind so there's no click
here there's only a clip on this side
okay so you just slot the memory in this
side open up the clip slot it in the
side clip a shot only one clip we've got
a memo okay button which should pretty
much ensure that your board will boot
with any memory no problem okay we've
got there GPU switch we've got what on
earth is this no just the top four
module okay we've got our 24 pin power
connector
we've got hmm okay I don't think this is
actually an anti surge SATA 6 gigabits
per second port I think this is just a
sadist 3 6 gigabit per second port and
they're talking about the anti surge
technology that is part of protect a 3.0
ok next we have a BIOS chip then we've
got to say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
ports 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports a chipset cooler and finally we've
got our front panel connectors 4 USB 2.0
front
headers we've got a FireWire front panel
header a really a parallel port hitter
fascinating okay and then we've got uh
ha okay we're down to the PCI Express
slot so I love it
they have you killed PCI so this is a
high-end board know PCI done boom we've
got a PCIe 16x slot that runs at full
16x PCIe 1x slot that will be covered as
soon as you put your high-performance
dual slot graphics card in here we've
got a PCIe 8x slot so this one only runs
at 8x if you put something in it and
then this one will run ATX as well so
it's either 16x or it's 8 X 8 X so full
support for crossfire and SLI remember
PCIe 8 X is enough for crossfire and SLI
this guy right here only runs at PCIe 4x
actually hold on let me look at this yes
good okay so this one only runs at PCIe
4x and that one's running off the
Southbridge not off the PCIe controller
on the CPU so it's lower performance if
you are running crossfire sli use these
two slots now what's funny is this board
doesn't include an SLI bridge so you may
have to buy one but they are available
so don't worry too much about it
remember crossfire bridges come with
your video card not with your
motherboard we got 2 ps2 ports one Mouse
one keyboard we've got two USB 3.0 ports
optical audio out we've got four USB 2.0
ports we've got firewire eSATA and
Gigabit Ethernet with 7.1 audio to roam
