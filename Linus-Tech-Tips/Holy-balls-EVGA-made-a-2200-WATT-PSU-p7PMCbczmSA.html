our CES 2018 content if you want to make
an awesome website or online store you
can use their all-in-one platform today
we're here at EVGA not checking out a
motherboard or a graphics card or a cool
or anything like that we're checking out
a power supply the EVGA supernova 2200 P
tuned if you can't tell from the name
it's a 2200 watt power supply that's
insane that has 183 point three amps on
the 12 volt rail but despite all of that
in standard room temperature ambience at
full load a full 2200 watts of full load
it will only sit at 50 degrees Celsius
it is rated on the 80 + Platinum 230
volt European scale and yeah European
are wimpy 110 volt North American
standards are not going to apply here
this is way too much power so they had
to move to 220 volts European for this
power supply but that probably won't
affect anybody that'll actually probably
be a benefit for most people because
this is targeted towards probably minors
considering if you look at the
connections on the back there's 9 VGA
cables plugins and each one of those
cables branches off into two PCIe
connectors that's 18 PCIe connectors you
can't even you can't even use that
normally in a normal computer so
definitely definitely for the miners and
I don't know what the peripheral cables
are we haven't figured that out yet
we're gonna free that out probably
tomorrow so I'm gonna throw myself in
the hotel suite later where I'm gonna
break down what kind of crazy rigs you
can actually build with this thing and
what you'd actually use it for in the
real world what kind of mining setups
you might have so I got really busy and
actually had Jake put all this together
so I'm gonna read his notes off here
right now if you threw together a seller
on G 39:30 and asrock H 110 pro BTC +
which is compatible with 13 graphics
cards 13 gtx 1070 t is some Patriots
signature 4 gigabyte edition Ram a
silicon power 60 gigabyte SSD or go with
the flash drive version bunch of risers
a 13 GPU frame
the EVGA supernova 2200 watt power
supply you could pull about 6500 Killah
hash minding directly to equi hash and
jared generate about 65 to $80 a day as
of right now and bitcoin just dipped a
little bit so that might actually go up
later on pretty insane don't have a
price for that whole bench because it's
gonna change drastically wherever you
are and prices right now and all this
kind of stuff is like freaking all over
the place so if you deal shop and try to
play your cards right you can make some
pretty decent Bitcoin whoa thanks Luke

rundown also thank you to Squarespace
