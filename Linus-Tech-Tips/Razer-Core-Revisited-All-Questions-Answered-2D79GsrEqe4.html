fact any other thunderbolt external
video card enclosure like the Asus XG 2
is pretty simple
I've got a general review that does a
good job of tackling the basics here but
here's that in a nutshell your laptop is
small and portable but could use more
graphics horsepower for a better gaming
experience so it's a powered box that
uses a desktop video card to boost your
frames per second say temple the problem
is that while I was making my simple
review of the core I ended up with far
more questions than answers can you put
in something other than a video card is
Thunderbolt 3 a significant bottleneck
does it perform better on an external
display will it work with non Razer
notebooks can it be run in a daisy chain
configuration can it handle the biggest
hottest graphics cards on the market
what about CPU bottlenecks so after
three full days of testing I'm back
welcome to the Razer core deep dive
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description first order of
business acoustics
i mentioned in my review that the core
should have a power switch to reduce fan
noise at idle but I didn't quantify why
and this is why I plan to replace the
fans in my core and why I think that
it's a must-have feature on a Gen 2
product Gaming noise levels are vastly
improved but I don't want to hear 5 fans
spin up every single time I want to use
the USB 3 hub or the Ethernet port the
good news is that no matter what I threw
at it thermal performance is pretty much
on par with an open-air test bench it
handled the GTX 480 one of the hottest
most power-hungry cards ever made
especially when over vaulted without
even breaking a sweat and if the drivers
had managed to install
I'm sure the Radeon 6990 wouldn't have
been an issue either given that that
monster was able to physically fit
inside which leads really nicely then
into my next question what about non
graphics cards razer has nothing about
this on their product page and even when
asked directly said we'll get back to
you then as of filming this promptly
never did so I dug into it myself my 10
gigabit network card worked perfectly
after I hot plugged it in installed
drivers and rebooted a Blackmagic
intensity Pro and a vago raid card were
both similar stories and my Asus USB 3.1
card and a fork a capture device on the
other end of it a USB one even hot
plugged without rebooting finally I
chatted with red tech support who
confirmed that their CEO has already
experimented with the red rocket X
accelerator card
so while Razer hasn't done any firmware
tuning or proper validation of these and
my simple plug it in and see if it works
for five minutes is by no means a
substitute it actually wouldn't
surprise me if compatibility was pretty
strong another thing that I'm annoyed
that Razer wouldn't talk to me about is
compatibility with other devices
yes Razer I know the official statement
is that it is officially compatible with
the blade stealth and the new blade at
launch but what I want to know is does
it work with other computers so after
much digging the answer is yes and no if
you picked up a machine six months ago
and you're expecting to just plug and
play into your Thunderbolt 3 port you
will be disappointed but there's also
good news after fighting with needlessly
complicated bios and thunderbolt
firmware updates this is how to do a
BIOS update by the way I got the core
working mostly as intended on a Sager NP
98 70 and msi gt72 s and Asus x99 deluxe
ii and i've heard reports of it working
just fine on the intel skull canyon nook
and dell XPS 15 2016 so everything I've
tried it on however while the Sager
machine and x99 deluxe 2 both worked
perfectly after some initial forced
driver installation nonsense my MSI gt70
2's put up a solid fire strikes core
then got crushed in real world
performance without msi being able to
offer me any advice
yes msi i tried asking razer well hold
on a second deadline is why does this
matter
vana sai laptop and for that matter the
desktop motherboard already has desktop
grade graphics it's because I wanted to
know how the funderbolt interface is
affecting performance which can only be
achieved through an apples-to-apples
test by isolating all the other
variables and since there is no way to
physically install a 970m
in the core to run against the one in
the blade 14 I needed a machine with a
graphics card that I could so then the
strange unrealistic synthetic scores
continue but in real games we're looking
at about a 25% performance
with a gtx 980 and significantly more
than that with a higher performance
graphics card overclocking by the way is
not limited by razer in any way but on
the 1080 other bottlenecks seem to make
it a moot point so Nvidia suggestion was
that the PCI Express gen3
x4 interface could be holding us back
but I didn't really buy that and a quick
round of benchmarks with one of my
motherboard slots forced to 4x speed
settled this for me while it does seem
to play a role it is not the whole story
also of note here by the way is the fact
that the 6700 HQ holds its own
head-to-head with the last generation 8
core Extreme Edition except in extremely
CPU bound titles like cities skylines
pretty darn well as for the dual core 8
gig Ram equipped stealth I would expect
that to lag behind a lot faster and I
probably wouldn't recommend pairing it
with a top-tier GPU in the core anyway
it appears that the performance hit more
likely comes from the overhead
associated with converting from PCI
Express to Thunderbolt 3 and or making
PCI Express a hot pluggable interface
something that on windows anyway it is
definitely not designed for the next
question I wanted to answer especially
as someone who wouldn't necessarily care
about using the core with an external
display is house performance in loopback
mode using the external GPU to power the
laptops own display actually not bad
you'll take a 15% ish hit less if all
you want to do is run 3d mark all day
which is what I showed back in my first
video some other general questions now
then some GPU features like g-sync
freesync and so etc are supported on
desktop GPUs and even notebooks that
contain desktop GPUs like the GT 72 s
but not on notebook GPUs so how does
that work with the core where you can
potentially have both if you're using an
external display you should be able to
use the feature set of the GPU
loaded in the core but that won't
necessarily be the case if you're using
loopback mode next question can you run
SLI no not in any of the traditional
ways though that doesn't mean that a
system with both a D GPU and an external
GPU couldn't enable both of them for
certain workloads
okay what about daisy chaining Linus
great question
the core has only one Thunderbolt port
and this is by design it does not
officially support daisy chaining even
though that's part of the funderbolt
standard but when I asked razor we'll
hold on a second could it just sit at
the end of a chain with other devices
that do Razer completely unhelpful II
stayed tight-lipped thankfully though a
kitty Oh helped a brother out here and
hooked me up with their Thunder 3 duo
Pro which is a tooless dual SSD or hard
drive enclosure that worked flawlessly
both on its own allowing me to fully
utilize the speed of the SSDs I
installed and in between the core and
the system though I should emphasize
here that this is an unsupported
configuration and I cannot promise that
drive access wouldn't affect gaming
performance if you were doing both of
them at the same time leading us to the
last and possibly most important
question for me to answer does any of
this even matter ignoring me $100 rebate
with qualifying system this is a $500
doodad we're talking about here one that
I'm not recommending due to CPU
bottlenecks pairing with a top-tier
graphics card on the machine that is
arguably more purpose-built for it the
razor blade stealth given that it can
charge off the core which is pretty cool
a machine though that only costs twice
as much as the empty core box in the
first place I mean who has money for a
core but not a badass desktop to go
alongside their portable machine I mean
hell you can even build a badass
portable desktop in the Danny 4 sfx case
that's the same size as the core but
with the entire computer in it and this
is all valid but my fascination with the
core come
not from thinking that everyone should
buy one but from my excitement about
what this technology means costs will
come down and having portability while
I'm on the go and power at home with the
ability to actually upgrade a laptop is
very appealing and on top of that
remember project Christine I and a lot
of other people dismissed it as a pipe
dream but core is a huge step towards no
compromises high speed hot swappable pc
component modules a pretty cool future
speaking of no compromises have you ever
thought to yourself gee this vinyl wrap
that I have on my device just kind of
sucks
it doesn't fit well it peels off well
there's no need for that because debrand
has no compromises vinyl wraps they are
precision cut and available in pretty
much any authentic 3m vinyl finish that
you could want and the best part about D
brand skins aside from the fact that
they're available for laptops phones
tablets game consoles controllers and
more is their configurator it is
fricking awesome you can see your device
in a real-time preview from every angle
you can adjust and customize using
different colors and different finishes
and then BOOM you confirm the order
they're robots pack it up ship it
anywhere in the world and if anything
does happen to go wrong they have
separate customer service robots that
will absolutely get you taken care of so
check it out over at the D brand link in
the video description
please note D brand does not require to
use a bright pink freakin carbon fire
wrap like Linus does you can pick your
own so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured at Amazon in

description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join now that you're done doing all that
stuff you're probably wondering what to
