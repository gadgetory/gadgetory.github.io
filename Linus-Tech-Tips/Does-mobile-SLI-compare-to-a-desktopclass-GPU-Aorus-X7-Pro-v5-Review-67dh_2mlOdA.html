has been getting a little crowded with
features like desktop class GPUs nvme
solid-state drives and even freaking
water cooling docks so it's not
surprising that today's entrant into the
fray the Auris x7 pro v5 tries to set
itself apart with features like mobile
sli and hdmi 2.0 but does it live up to
the billing
stay tuned to find out
coursera claims unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its new void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter click
the link in the description to learn
more the first thing I noticed about the
x7 was how thin it is with height of
only 2 and 1/2 centimeters even with the
lid closed it's pretty damn small at
seven pounds however it's hard to call
the x7 light but the slimmer profile
does at least offer a little more
portability than some of the behemoths
we've had the roll through our office
lately well start our physical tour with
the top which features a plain black
finish except for the Auris logo which
lights up when you open the lid the
bottom is fairly understated as well
with not much going on except for rubber
feet and some ventilation slots things
get more interesting when we move around
to the sides though with the right side
featuring both HDMI 2.0 and a mini
DisplayPort for flexibility if you're
attaching additional displays a USB 3.1
type C port a more standard USB 3.0 port
and an SD card reader that connects via
PCI Express the HDMI 2.0 support is
especially nice if you want 4k at 60
Hertz and can't use a display port cable
moving to the left side we see a
Kensington lock slot killer Gigabit LAN
port a second HDMI port that allows you
to support two external monitors in
Nvidia surround a VGA port for older
displays another USB 3.0 port and jacks
for your microphone and headphones the
back features one last USB 3.0 port and
a DC input for the included power brick
as well as some additional ventilation
for all the goodies inside when you open
the lid you'll see a 17.3 inch 1080p 75
Hertz IPS display with g-sync support a
webcam which we're filming this on right
now a pair of unremarkable sounding
speakers directly below the screen and a
backlit horus logo power button the
keyboard is backlit with adjustable
brightness white lights that can be
turned off completely if you so desire
and features 30 key rollover the keys
themselves are pretty standard for
chiclet keys and you also get a set of
programmable macro keys on the far left
hand side the touchpad is quite glossy
compared to the rest of the chassis and
features a nice Oris
logo there's also tactile bumps on the
bottom bit which make identifying the
clicking area quite a bit easier which I
liked what I didn't care for though was
how the touch pad felt a tad too grippy
to my finger which got caught on it a
couple times I was trying to scroll it
just feels kind of weird under the hood
you can unlock skylake core i7 6820 HK
processor 32 gigs of DDR 4 memory that's
upgradeable to 64 to nvidia gtx 970m
GPUs in sli giving you both the benefits
and issues that come with that 500
gigabytes of nvme solid state storage on
two drives in raid 0 an additional one
terabyte mechanical hard drive and
bluetooth with wireless AC adapters the
battery is lithium polymer that's inside
a software package that you can't access
from the exterior so it's not the
easiest thing to replace interestingly
there's also a dedicated hardware
encoder for avermedia that is supposed
to take the load off of your CPU and GPU
while streaming so you won't lose as
much performance getting into testing we
started out by running through Cinebench
Crysis 3 and tomb raider putting up the
x7 against our Sager NP 9 8 7 0 u 2 G
which you can check out in more detail
up here or Oh - I don't know we were
interested to see how a couple of 970
m's and sli would do against a fully
fledged desktop 980 and the answer is
pretty well the x7 beat out the Sager in
both Crysis 3 and tomb raider by small
margins and scored well above the 75
Hertz framerate of our screen even with
the settings cranked way up which is
definitely ideal Cinebench was a
different story as this is a more CPU
bound benchmark and it saw the Sager win
by about 24% with its desktop class
skylake i7 but the x7 managed a is still
very respectable 704 points we were also
able to get a stable overclock of 4.0
gigahertz on our CPU and A+ 100
megahertz offset on our two GPUs without
playing with any voltages although the
system ran a bit warm on our skybox load
tests at stock with both the CPU and GPU
getting up to 84 degrees overclocking
only heated things up by about
one or two degrees regardless of whether
or not we overclocked though the fans
were very loud during gaming you might
want to use a pair of headphones
specifically noise cancelling headphones
if you want a game on this thing so
what's our conclusion considering it
beat out our desktop-class gtx 980 based
Sager and is going to cost less when it
comes out in mid-march the value
proposition looks pretty darn good
especially when you consider the
additional bells and whistles like USB
3.1 type C HDMI 2.0 support G sync the
hardware encoder and I believe the Sager
doesn't have an nvme drive at between
2,400 and twenty-seven hundred dollars
depending on the configuration the x7
pro v5 could be a pretty compelling
option thanks for watching guys in the
studio's sect you know what to do but it
was awesome get subscribe hit the like
