mass consumer workhorse card that
replaces the 970 in terms of steam serve
a crushing sales why price when the GTX
970 launched an EVGA superclocked
Edition was about 350 US dollars you
might expect that EVGA is 1070 and
everyone else's for that matter it would
be about the same price nope it's about
four hundred and forty dollars a 100 ish
dollar increase in price similarly a gtx
960 was about two hundred and ten
dollars but the fancy new 1060 ranges
from 250 to 300 and I expect the non
crappy plastic ones to start at 280 or
290 is it worth the price increase can
it live up to the hype let's find out
mass drop is featuring the fostex th x00
headphones with new nd color year cups
check them and other drops out at the
link in the video description so yes the
GTX 1060 is here and with it comes a
fancy new Pascal GPU named GP 106 a step
down from the GP 104 sporting GTX 1080
and 1070 s but still with a lot of the
goodies and performance improvements
which come with being on the Pascal
platform at all the biggest story here
however is how it will fare against AM
DS offering the R X 480 this is the
first time there has been a Pascal GPU
launched since the 480 was released so
that makes it interesting first though
specs the 1060 features 1280 CUDA cores
a boost clock of 1700 and 8 megahertz 6
gigs of gddr5 vram which is clocked at
eight gigabit per second and an overall
memory bandwidth of 192 gigabytes per
second and all of that is wrapped up in
a TDP package of only 120 watts we'll
see how all of this translates to
performance later on next let's have a
look at the all-new cooler design it's
clearly related design wise to the
cooler found on the founders edition of
the 1070 and 1080 but has some core
differences like no backplate an Nvidia
logo that doesn't light up a physical
extension beyond the PCB to house the
fan a slightly relaxed angularity design
and no window to look into the heatsink
fans for the die cast aluminum body also
contains two copper heat pipes embedded
into the base of an aluminum heatsink
but what this car doesn't have too much
surprise is an SLI connector now in
videos official statement on this more
or less is that if you want more
performance you should just buy a 1070
or 1080 instead of 210 60 s setting that
they would rather focus their support on
SLI setups for those cards instead that
being said you will still be able to use
multiple 1060 s together in certain
games if those games are able to take
advantage of MDA or
Lda explicit modes in directx12 I'd
highly suggest checking out my video on
the confusing state of SLI and multiple
GPU setups raw performance wise it
walked all over the rx 480 in every
title except for hitman which admittedly
is a pretty AMD tuned title it one in
Christ is three Star Wars Battlefront
and tomb raider all at 1440p with very
high settings enabled by seven eight and
10 FPS respectively then in hitman it
lost at those same settings by about 4
fps
then to layer on top of that the story
was rather similar at 4k with medium
settings but this isn't the whole story
in AMD fans before you rush down to the
comments and start screaming at me for
being what is kind of a shill at this
point we must recognize that the 1060 is
25 to 50% more expensive than the RX 480
and that's where the conversation
changes in the dollars per frame race
the RX 480 wins every single time
sometimes by rather narrow margins other
than the massive gap in hitman but it
still wins does that mean the 1060 is a
bad card and AMD wins no but to be clear
that totally doesn't mean AMD lost
either that's not what I'm saying the
price and performance deltas on these
cards are significant enough that I
don't even fully agree with them being
in the same category sure if you buy the
most expensive rx 480 and the cheapest
1060 they more or less equate in price
but that's a rather odd competition I'm
happy with the 1060 and I'm very happy
with the 480 it's a good time to be a PC
gamer that's basically all I have to say
and it's a good time to be a mobile app
developer looking for a simple payment
solution all you got to do is check out
the Braintree V 0 SDK which is one small
snippet of code and you can be all set
up in less than 10 minutes they even
have support staff ready to walk you
through the process over the phone if
you need them their code supports
Android iOS and JavaScript clients and
they have SDKs in seven programming
languages this makes it easy to offer
multiple mobile payment types including
PayPal Apple pay Bitcoin venmo
Android
cards and more all with that quick
simple single integration to learn more
and for your first fifty thousand
dollars in transactions fee free go to
Braintree payments comm slash Linus

going crazy lately because everyone's
releasing all these different models and
stuff and I'm going to check basically
all of them out so hopefully you like
