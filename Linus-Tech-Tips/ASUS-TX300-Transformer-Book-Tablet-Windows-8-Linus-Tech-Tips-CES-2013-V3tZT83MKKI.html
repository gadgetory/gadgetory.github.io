look at what might be one of the coolest
things that we are going to see here at
the show this year welcome to Linus tech
tips at CES 2013 our trip to the show
this year is powered by Corsair maker of
quality pc components and peripherals
our trusted storage partner is seagate
technology and our trusted networking
partner is linksys
this is yet another notebook from a sip
no I'm just kidding this is the TX 300
transformer book so this is a notebook
it is a tablet so much like their Tai
Chi you can use it in either form but
unlike the Tai Chi you can now
completely detach it from the base so
the joker is making when we first walked
in here because diesel has a very large
android phone was this is probably the
next evolution for you it's kind of like
gap oh no hold on i mean i meant i am
indigo i mean i'm in an elevator sorry i
can't get breaking up sorry let's go
standing there like that everyone sees
this happening but seriously guys it
comes with a core i5 or a core i7 this
particular unit as a whole meets the
Ultrabook specification from Intel which
means that it's extremely thin extremely
light has those security features
includes high-speed connectivity in this
case in all likelihood USB 3 on the base
station but we're going to find that
after runs for four to five hours on
battery which is competitive with
something like a surface pro from
Microsoft except for the immensely
larger screen it's an IPS panel that
runs at full HD 1920 x 1080 it has up to
a hundred and twenty eight gig msata SSD
and pretty much everything is in here
now that transformer brandon you guys
have seen it before you know what it
comes with you've got a couple things
that you can take for granted number one
is there's probably a detachable
keyboard of some sort in this case the
detachable keyboard has a keyboard it's
got extra battery life in it it's got a
touchpad it's also a Windows 8 machine
so the experience using this is going to
be way better than on an Android device
then you got a bunch of other stuff
there's a magnetic power SD expansion
some indicator LEDs ok ok ok nothing not
exceptional yet here we go to super
speed USB 3 ports display port and a
full-sized ethernet jack so you can use
it as a wired sort of dock station once
you attach it to the base the bottom is
just a gorgeous brush metal finish you
got that diesel that looks good looks
good and the hinge as always on
transformer products feels very very
rigid and very solid see once without
this
you could hardly move the thing it's
very solid chiclet style keyboard again
something we've come to expect so the
rest of the lid is actually a lot like
you'd expect from a typical tablet
you've got your volume you've got your
battery indicator you've got your HDMI
out so it's micro HDMI out so you can do
HDMI here or display port on the base
you've got headphones out microSD which
gives you two SD expansion options
full-size SD and microSD you've got aha
this is a new dock connector well why
did they do that Linus I'm going to tell
you why in just a moment as soon as I
make sure that there's nothing else here
that I have to show your antlers your
power button up there very very slim I'm
actually going to do this I'm in the AC
sweet and I'm pulling out my iphone the
thickness comparison there there you go
I'm just trying to prove a point that
the asus product is incredibly slim you
got that awesome check this out not only
do you get expanded everything else you
get expanded storage by plugging it in
to the base station so it comes with I
think it's a 500 gig hard drive so it's
got a 101 I think I got that
repositioned kind of place I'm gonna
happen there we go it comes with a
breaking everything no one's looking
right okay good comes with an SSD in
here and a 500 gig hard drive in there
which means it really has all the
functionality of a full notebook and all
the functionality of a very large tablet
or smartphone running full windows 8 no
RT nonsense because it's running a core
i5 or core i7 processor so thank you for
checking out this video on the TX 300
we're here at CES 2013 don't forget to
subscribe to make sure that you see all
of our coverage of this awesome event
although I don't know how much more
awesome that's going to get them this
