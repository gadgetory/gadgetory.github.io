Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville
Alabama and I brought myself a friend
was a it's Destin from smarter every day
and he is going to be dropping some
knowledge bombs today because behind me
is the actual guidance computer from the
Saturn 5 rocket this is one of the
engines and maybe you can enlighten us
what's the significance of the Saturn 5
Oh everybody knows that's what we use to
go to the moon this is the 50th
anniversary of the Apollo moon landing
and so it's a really big deal right now
so yeah what you're going to talk about
the Davy instrument unit that's what got
the rocket on course to go to the moon
and then the Apollo computer took over
but you're talking about the rocket
steering Wow mark your calendar ladies
and gentlemen windows 7 end of life is
around the corner so smartdeploy can
help you migrate to Windows 10 and
manage those pesky updates claim your
free licenses worth over $700 at
smartdeploy comm slash Linus we'll have
that linked below
so what we're looking at right now is
the instrument unit for the Saturn 5
rocket why is it in the shape of a ring
well to answer this and many other dumb
questions we've got some amazing
resources today so some of you probably
don't know this but Destin from smarter
every day
is literally a rocket scientist by
training and he actually arranged
someone no offense to him quite a bit
more special as well so the person I'm
talking to right now is Luc Tali
who actually worked on the flight
evaluation team for this rocket when he
worked at IBM back in the 60s and he was
kind enough to stick around for
literally hours to educate my Canadian
self let's start by breaking down what
we're looking at here there are three
main parts navigation guidance and
control is from about the bottom of the
ring up to a little over halfway up the
left side the telemetry section is up at
the top and the other side is
environmental control the umbilical
plate and our power sources so let's
start with that section it includes our
main power source now some flights we
get three of these batteries and some of
them we get four but it's always the
same silver zinc 5300 and power 125
pound batteries now the technology to
build lighter weights batteries didn't
really exist at the time and in fact
these aren't even rechargeable you just
pour the goop in about 28 hours before
lunch and let er rip now these gave the
scientists about 11 hours of life time
depending on which of the four buses was
pulling power and that was all they
needed so the crew separates at about
four hours and then they only really
need about another hour or two of
tinkering to either send the rocket
around the Sun or smash it into the moon
if they want to get some seismic data
readings it really depended on the
purpose of the mission now we've got the
rest of the environmental control panel
or triple point device so-called because
it's got liquid solid and vapor all in
one spot the main pieces are as follows
you've got your cooling duct which runs
around the entire outside of the ring
this circulates conditioned air
pre-launch because it's pretty hot down
at the Cape then right before fueling it
switches over to nitrogen because oxygen
and rocket fuel is a pretty bad time
then you've got coolant pumps that pump
a liquid coolant to be clear not water
around to the anodized aluminum cold
plates that are distributed around the
ring and then pull this one really got
my inner cooling geek all sorts of hot
and bothered these two plates here are
part of what they call the sublimator
now if you've got up to 400 watts of
heat per cooling plate and we've got 15
of them around the ring you've got to
dissipate that somehow but the
keen-witted among you have probably
already figured out that in the vacuum
of space
conventional radiators don't work
there's no air to exchange the heat with
so the way the sublimator works is it
has a piece of sintered metal that's
exposed directly to space this reservoir
down here then is full of water and
pressurized nitrogen gas with a flexible
membrane in between that forces the
water through the micro pores in our
sintered metal now because these
channels are so small the water freezes
nearly immediately then because that ice
gets exposed to such a low pressure
environment it sublimates
going directly from solid to vapour
allowing it to dissipate about 9,000
watts so this is kind of like
conventional phase change cooling but
space-age literally this system allows
our coolant to stay between 50 and 60
degrees Fahrenheit throughout the entire
mission with only the volume of water in
the reservoir to fuel it next up power
comes in from the batteries to our power
distributors these are the high current
ones here that break out to sub power
distributors one at the top of the Ring
and the other one over on the other side
those ones go directly to components or
to further lower current power
distributors and the whole thing runs at
28 volts we'll get back to those a
little bit later
now all this distribution is actually
done with relays no semiconductor
switching or anything like that the cold
hard truth is that semiconductors just
weren't reliable enough yet so the way
that that worked was they got a signal
from the black box called a switch
selector so it's the one that's right to
the right of our tic-tac-toe box here
and that was tied to the computer so
when it's time to fire a retrorocket or
start an engine or turn on the cooling
system the switch flicks now we're
getting into navigation guidance and
control down here on the bottom of the
ring so this sphere right here in front
of me is full of pressurized nitrogen
gas and it feeds the gas bearing
remember we want as little friction as
possible to reduce drift for what they
call the guidance platform now it looks
similar to the nitrogen ball but the
insides are absolutely nothing alike
we've actually got a breakaway here that
we can look at to see the main
components three accelerometers and
three gyroscopes now the fixed thing in
the middle is called the stable table
and before launch they release it and
then courtesy of our X Y and z-axis
gyros it actually maintains a fixed
position so it's always in the exact
same orientation it was left in no
matter how the rocket is oriented or
traveling around the Earth now I said
exact but that wasn't quite what I meant
because for short missions this kind of
system is fine
but for longer ones it needs to get a
little more advanced because no matter
what you do even if you've got a
nitrogen bearing a gyro is going to
drift a little bit so if you're doing a
multi-month mission you need to build in
systems to allow you to recalibrate it
now the accelerometers which are just
gyros with a weight hanging off them
that torque them causing them to precess
use the degree of precession as a
measure of the acceleration that gets
sent to the computer which uses that
data to calculate velocity which I guess
brings us pretty nicely to our computer
so this small box here is the lvdc
or launch vehicle digital computer this
is a truly remarkable machine
the processing modules had transistors
that are actually big enough to see with
the naked eye and were soldered to the
compute chips built into these boards
using a predecessor to ball grid array
soldering and the memory well the nine
hundred and seventeen thousand five
hundred and four bits of working system
memory was actually hand-woven from
copper wire and iron rings that whole
system was double redundant for memory
and triple redundant for the compute
destined and I actually go into a little
bit more depth on this in the video on
his channel so don't miss it we're gonna
have it linked below the second box here
is the LV da or a launch vehicle data
adapter this contains a whole bunch of
stuff it's got power supplies for itself
and the LV DC and a bunch of interfaces
to other electronic components as well
as digital to analog converters and
analog to digital converters because
thing is not everything about this
system was digital so this cylinder
right here contains the analog computer
from the saturn v this is the one that
actually issues the commands to move the
engines and steer the rocket so the
whole computer here digital and analog
has no operating system but the thing is
you wouldn't want to run Windows or
Android on something like this anyway
consumer operating systems work by
queuing up inputs and processing tasks
and then executing them whenever it's
most convenient
it basically processes them in batches
well this is a real-time system and it
operates on a fixed two-second loop with
interrupts so if an input comes in that
must be executed within a given amount
of time where people could die it needs
to be able to handle that now let's come
back to these two black boxes again
remember these are our switch selectors
we've got a hundred and twelve lines
going out of them that carry commands
from the computer directly to components
or distributors telling them to power on
or power off so again for example let's
say the cooling vent if we go over our
temperature threshold it sends out a
command that says hey
open it up we need to sublimate some ice
now each stage of the rocket needs these
and that's actually what the wiring up
on the top of the Ring is for it's to
link our computer here two more of these
in the other stages although obviously
they're not attached right now while
we're up here this last quarter or so of
the Ring is for the telemetry package so
we've got our transmitters measuring rax
multiplexers and apparently the VHF
systems on here are pretty close to what
Apollo 12 would have looked like so this
is not an R&amp;amp;D thing that might have had
more telemetry stuff this is pretty darn
close to the real deal which I guess is
a pretty appropriate way for us to
celebrate the Apollo 11 missions 50th
anniversary yes my friends it has been
that long since humans first walked on
the moon if you believe in that sort of
thing which you should the view sonic
x10 4k smart projector features a native
4k UHD resolution lamp free projection
so it uses an advanced LED light source
and of course less energy consumption
again thanks to LED backlighting it's
rated for 30,000 hours of use so if you
use this projector eight hours a day it
will last you more than 10 years
it features screen casting support
allowing you to project a mirrored
display from your device using Wi-Fi and
you can use your smartphone as a remote
with the viewsonic app that's available
for both iOS and Android it features
Auto Keystone and autofocus it's
short-throw
allowing a minimum distance of six feet
to achieve a 100 inch screen it works
with Amazon Alexa and Google assistant
it's portable and easy to use and of
course it's got built-in Harman Kardon
speakers because why the heck not it's
small easy to transport and you can use
it both inside or outdoors although I
wouldn't recommend using it in the rain
and you can check it out and buy today
at Amazon at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
and a massive extra shadow for Destin
from smarter every day again go check
out his channel and to the US Space and
Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama for
making this entire thing possible they
really did keep the thing open late for
us to finish this video so they're super
awesome people here and if you're ever
in the area make sure
check it out if you guys dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
and the stuff we featured ok I mean if
you want to buy a rocket like it's a
pretty big endeavor but power to you I
guess also linked in the video
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like the one I'm wearing and
our community forum which you should
totally join that's our standard outro
because normally we feature a product
