brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX alright guys welcome to the
cherry booth where we will be checking
out the Cherry MX board 6.0 the juicy
details on this board are mainly in its
RK or real key technology the idea
behind this technology is replacing the
traditional digital scanning tech inside
of a keyboard with then actually even
older analog tech in the form of
something similar to an oscilloscope
cherry tells me that this technology
will take one sample in 0.4 milliseconds
then take another sample in another 0.4
milliseconds all while running
calculations on what keys are currently
doing something in order report out a
key press in 0.8 milliseconds but the
USB 2.0 standard bumps it up to a total
time of one millisecond cherry also
claims that today's keyboards have an
average reaction time of about 20
milliseconds with some boards going as
high as 45 plus milliseconds so it's
crazy freaking fast but what about the
rest of the keyboard well it will come
with either Cherry MX blue red brown or
black switches although they're not all
available right now and it will have a
magnetically attaching wrist rest which
features real rubber not synthetic and
an aluminum upper body which will be
coated in order to protect it from the
oils in your skin which could cause it
to wear away and look ugly over time it
has a nicely braided USB cable as well
with a hundred different brightness
levels for the backlight key caps I
would love to test a bunch of keyboards
reporting speeds on my own using
something like a beagle USB 2.0 analyzer
but this would be a lot of research and
a lot of work so let me know what you
think in the comments down below or on
twitter at luke underscore la AFR if you
want to see all the rest of our CES
content be sure to subscribe to Linus
tech tips thank you to Phantom glass for
protecting our phones and sending us
here this year also we have a cool video
coming with them very soon which well I
can't tell you much about it doesn't
have a beagle USB 2.0 analyzer in it I
know that much also thank you to HyperX
for sending us here this year check out
their YouTube page youtube.com slash
HyperX if they get a hundred thousand
subscribers on that gaming focus Channel
