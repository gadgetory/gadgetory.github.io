last video with my Frankenstein project
with the dual Borya sirs and the crazy
six core sub-zero coolant thing so I've
actually made a couple of changes since
then I've added another 5870 in
crossfire so along with the eyefinity
addition card there's a regular 5870 I
know the memory amounts don't match but
whatever for the sake of of my
experiment here I don't really need them
to so the good news is that I did manage
to get some slightly better overclocking
results out of this machine the bad news
is that it wasn't as much different as I
would have hoped so the highest I was
able to get to was about four point two
five gigahertz and that was without
really doing any tweaking on the bus
speed so I'm basically just boosting up
the multiplier increasing the voltage
until it's stable and so that was pretty
much as high as I could go but bearing
in mind too that I'm never satisfied
with an overclock until it's 100% stable
so I unless it's running six instances a
prime and it's not failing I'm not happy
with it so yeah I was able to post and I
was able to run limited benchmarks
slightly higher but to me that's not
really worth anything you can see my CPU
temperatures are 26 degrees it is hot in
this room - this thing kicks out a ton
of heat which brings me to something
else that I wanted to mention last time
which is that um yeah I think I
mentioned power consumption but then I
never actually showed you my power meter
so let me just show this to you so this
system is consuming at the wall over 900
watts under load so I'm running that fir
benchmark as well as 6 instances of
prime95 and so that's with 250 870s
going one six core CPU - Boreas is I
mean these two guys alone consume 400
watts but I guess that's that goes to
show you actually that even a fairly
beefy system I mean we're talking 250
870's overclocked quad-core I have an
overclock the video cards that mind you
but even with that kind of settings
you're only looking at about 500 watts
the wall which means with an average
80-plus power supply you're probably
only looking at about 400 to 430 watts
of load power consumption on a fairly
high-end system so thanks for checking
out my video today on my overclocking
results with the Benham to 1090 T and
don't believe what CPU said tells you it
is a 10-9 dt</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
