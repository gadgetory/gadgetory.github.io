not seem that interesting on first
glance but I assure you it is this is
the PNY micro attach a premium USB Drive
you can tell that it's a tache instead
of attached because of the accent and
because I am Canadian I know how French
accents work imagine that okay so let's
get this open first of all this is an
eight gigabyte USB thumb drive and like
I said doesn't seem like there's really
anything much to be said about it it's
doesn't even advertise a rated speed
because something like this is not
really about speed it's about how small
it is and you'll notice I have a knife
today check that I'm always forgetting a
nice for my unboxings and have to like
tear things apart or use a key or a pen
alright so let's see what the insert
includes it includes um seems to be
taped shutter oh it's glued shut look at
that aha there we go oh so it includes a
little security tag these are great
because you can like stick them on the
bottoms of people's shoes and then when
they walk around in the mall they'll
have the alarms going off all over all
over the place we'll be able to figure
out what's going on they include a PNY
catalog which has something about their
verto cards their accelerate cards these
are their consumer gaming graphics cards
and they have their quadrille camera
man's looking somewhere else entirely Oh
built to order us beef that flash drives
I didn't know they do that look at that
so many models and colors and sizes you
can pick a logo and I had no idea p and
why did that then we've got their quadro
graphics cards up here and then they
have memory upgrade solutions okay you
see what's on the other side we also
have USB 2.0 flash drive solutions then
we have compact flash and SD and SDHC
and SSD drives there that is the entire
catalog for PNY very convenient to them
to include that for us then we have
operating considerations and precautions
okay wow that's pretty much it and they
show you how to plug it in because that
is what is cool about this Drive this is
those tiny tiny tiny USB drugs that if
you didn't know how to plug in and I
actually I actually sent someone to
print photos for me at costco and i sent
them with one of these micro drives and
the lady at costco at the photo counter
said that they didn't they didn't have a
slot for this particular kind of memory
device and so um not knowing how to show
them how to do it i ended up with well
my friend didn't know how to do it
either so i ended up with my my dry full
of my photos just coming back to me and
i didn't get my photos that was quite a
disappointing experience but i am going
to show all of my loyal viewers see I've
been keeping this board next to my
unboxing station for a reason it's been
leading up to this moment and if you
believe that I have a bridge to sell you
so it plugs in just like that check that
out so it is like the lowest profile
possible USB flash drive the only way
you can screw it up is if you stick it
in this way because that way it'll go in
for sure but see the metal contacts here
won't actually make don't actually touch
the metal contacts inside the USB port
so there you have it that is the PNY
micro otash a eight gig thanks for
