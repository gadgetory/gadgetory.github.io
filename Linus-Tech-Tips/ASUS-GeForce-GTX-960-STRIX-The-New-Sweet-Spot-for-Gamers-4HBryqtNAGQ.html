welcome to our review of the geforce gtx
960 Strix from a soos and videos latest
attempt to hit the sweet spot $200 price
point with a card that delivers a great
gaming experience but have they taken
things to the next level like they did
when they launched the 8800 GT at $200
or is the gtx 960 and uninspiring
architectural refresh that will delight
gamers about as much as their favorite
cereal now with 20% more brand for a
healthy colon something that's certainly
a good thing but just not that exciting
cooler masters casemod world series is
your opportunity to show off your
modding skills and win great prizes
entries close February 7th 2015 click
now to learn more so we will have a
video coming up that examines the 960s
competitiveness when you run a couple of
them in SLI but today's focus is on a
single card config and the card we'll be
using is a Seuss's Strix design one that
we already liked from the GTX 970 and
980 iterations and we continue to like
here why do we like it you might ask
well for a number of reasons which I
would normally explained in the context
of how it compares to a reference design
but gtx 960 reference designs don't
really exist out in the wild so all I
can really say about it is that the card
itself features a soos is usual solid
build quality with special attention to
overclock ability wine reduction and
lifespan improvements and the cooler is
a beefy quad heat pipe aluminum finish
air with 275 millimeter fans and this is
our favorite thing about Strix cards by
the way that only need to spin when the
card is under heavy load at idle it's
silent and even under light loads like
League of Legends at 1080p the fans do
not need to spin now it should be noted
that with recent updates to third-party
overclocking tools like afterburner you
can do this manually now with a custom
fan curve but I still think it's nice
for the other 95% of people out there
that Strix cards do it out of the box
now for the tour of the rest of the card
as expected it features of PCIe 16x Gen
3 slot at the bottom a sick
pin PCIe power connector at the back
with a handy-dandy indicator LED to show
you you've plugged it in correctly and
that's the light connector at the top
this card supports up to 2-way SLI and
on the rear the standard Maxwell i/o
config with a dual link DVI connector
three native DisplayPort 1.3 connectors
and HDMI 2.0 connector that can handle
up to 4k 60 Hertz on compatible displays
and support via the underlying video
engine for up to five K displays or up
to quad 4k multi stream displays Booya
not that you can expect this card to run
the most demanding Triple A titles at 4k
60fps anyway that's kind of unreasonable
but let's take a peek under the hood to
get a better idea of what we can expect
from the gtx 960 it features the same
Maxwell architecture as the gtx 750ti &amp;amp;
GTX 970 that are below and above it in
the product stack so that means support
for dynamic super resolution easy super
sample anti-aliasing that can be turned
on in GeForce experience to get the most
out of older games MFA a Nvidia is
equivalent to standard multi sample
anti-aliasing with a smaller performance
hit that is now compatible almost across
the board with DirectX 10 and 11 titles
something we did use for our testing on
the basis of PC purrs excellent
investigation into MFA's visual
similarity to NSA a/v xgi a lighting
feature that I suspect this card isn't
powerful enough to ever actually use in
a game anyway some memory bandwidth
efficiency improvements thanks to Nvidia
third-generation Delta color compression
and finally enormous improvements in
power consumption that Nvidia figures
gives the 960 about two times the
efficiency of a gtx 660 which might seem
like a strange comparison on the surface
I mean why was Nvidia so quick to
compare 960 not to the card whose price
and position it's directly replacing on
store shelves the GTX 760 but rather to
the gtx 660 in their press deck well
because marketing names aside it's
actually a much more direct successor to
that card because it features a fully
fledged GM 206 Maxwell core at its heart
compared to the fully fledged GK 106
Kepler in the 660 the 760 was actually a
bit of an
a duck card and that it actually had a
GK 104 bass GPU same as the GTX 670 680
and 770 but with some additional
kneecapping so that explains the step
down in memory interface width from 256
bit to 128 bit something I'm sure NVIDIA
hopes to compensate for with higher
clocks and they're more efficient memory
architecture but enough for that stuff
how does it actually perform well it's
fine I guess as usual we're using our 59
60 X overclocked test bench with all
cards overclocked to the max check the
spreadsheet in the video description for
the over clocks we achieved we ran some
modern triple-a titles at 1080p and some
more casual games at both 1080p and 4k
to see how it stacks up and well it
performs better than the GTX 760 while
costing less both for the end-user and
for Nvidia and delivers much better
power consumption numbers than its
competition on the red side although
power consumptions not quite as
important to me as you know kind of
killer features and actually one of the
killer features that NVIDIA has lorded
over AMD for the last year variable
refresh rate gaming with g-sync monitors
is no longer an Nvidia only thing thanks
to free sync monitor availability being
right on our doorstep right now
although Nvidia still has game stream
and I still do use my shield a lot so
conclusion time who is this card for
built-in h.265 encoding and decoding
silence and power efficiency with hdmi
2.0 output for 4k 60 hertz displays and
hdmi 2.0 TV anyone makes it sound like a
great media center PC card and it's
solid gaming performance lands it
exactly in line with what you'd expect
to get for 200 bucks and change does it
light the world on fire it's a great
overclocker with our GPU reaching about
a hundred megahertz above the boxes
advertised boosts clock without us even
tweaking anything and then beyond that
with some slider tuning but beyond that
no not really but then if we were
expecting it to then the fault is ours
for not paying attention to Nvidia
strategy over the last few years and/or
the ever changing 20 nanometer and 16
nanometer manufacturing process road
maps from chip boundaries like Global
Foundries
and tsmc Nvidia was on
to give us a crippled xo4 class chip at
this price point like they did with the
700 series given how well those are
selling at 350 to five hundred and fifty
dollars so we went back to a fully
enabled x06 in this case GM 206 which
still manages to be very competitive
speaking of managing to be competitive
can you imagine a world where your
favorite anime titles were available as
little as an hour after they originally
aired in Japan with professional
subtitles
can you imagine paying only a few bucks
a month for the privilege of accessing a
huge streaming library of anime content
on demand with shows like okay I don't
even know how to pronounce I can call it
acute hires defense club love and full
seasons of shows like Naruto Shippuden
well if you can then you've either got a
great imagination or you've heard of
crunchyroll.com because they have all
that stuff and if you want to start
enjoying their service all you need to
do is head over to crunchyroll.com slash
