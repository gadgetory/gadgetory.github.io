stress this camera has caught me through
over the last six months I needed a
quick snack before I get started
one moment please the Ripjaws km 570
mechanical keyboards from g.skill
features full RGB a simple design Cherry
MX switches and more check it out now at
the link below now red cameras are
inherently difficult to review because
their modularity allows nearly unlimited
different configurations so I'll focus
on the bill that we chose for
flexibility today and easy adaptability
for more specialized rigs in the future
we ended up with more first-party
accessories than many users because my
personal experience and anecdotal
evidence suggests that third-party
accessories can lead to compatibility
issues down the road and at least if we
experience a device failure there's only
one contact we need for support
something we did end up needing more on
that later
as for audio when Linus did his original
unboxing for the weapon we had plan to
use the off Hollywood Oh mod but after a
few weeks it would be generous to say
that for twenty-five hundred dollars
it wasn't giving us the audio quality we
expected so when beach tech offered to
send us their new DX a cine and DX a
Alexa we were really excited to find a
solution that didn't compromise on
quality or workflow synchronizing audio
impost is fine for feature films but
it's a nightmare for our rigorous daily
release schedule the DXA Alexa is our
daily driver now thanks to its two full
size XLR inputs and phantom power but
the DXA Sena is smaller gives you the
same fun control with harder buttons and
is much less expensive if you're running
and gunning with powered mics like
Sennheiser AVX system or something that
doesn't need power like a rode videomic
go okay enough about audio let's talk
about the most obvious reason you want
to buy this camera the sensor in the
weapon body or brain as read likes to
call it their helium sensor shoots at a
whopping 81 92 by 4320 add up to 60
frames per second
but the benefit of this is not
immediately obvious to the average
person it's not about publishing a take
a for the dozen or so people out there
with a kay displays is about flexibility
impost
being able to stabilize and punch in
with a very minimal loss in image
quality is great and for VFX work ink
mean absolute godsend but don't take my
word for it hello probably wondering
what the heck I'm doing here my name is
Nico and I'm part of a channel called
corridor we shoot a lot of stuff on the
red camera and Linus and Brandon asked
me to actually talk about resolution
these cameras shoot up to eight k but
TVs only up to 4k
so why shooting a higher resolution if
no one has a display to watch it there's
actually a couple useful things that it
does or that enables a filmmaker to do
for example when you shoot 8 K footage
you can zoom into the footage reframe it
crop it pan and stand without any
noticeable loss of sharpness up to a
certain point of course but you can zoom
in 150% 180 percent sometimes even 200%
and you can't tell that it was zoomed in
David Fincher actually does quite a bit
on house of cards it's one of the ways
you can get those perfect symmetrical
compositions because in post they'll go
in and reframe the frame to make it
perfect another thing you can do with
the extra resolution is get better
motion tracking because more resolution
means more detail to track more details
attract means more points more points
means a better camera Saul so her visual
effects artist the extra resolution can
be nice and finally the thing that I
find most useful is down sampling so if
you're shooting an 8k and you're
delivering to a 4k television
well you down sample that 8k for K that
means that you take 4 pixels and average
them out to 1 pixel for delivery so it
makes your image cleaner for example his
underexposed or you had push the color
grade quite a bit it's starting to get
noisy that noise starts to disappear and
if you're delivering to 1080p and you're
shooting an 8k that's a 16 to 1 pixel
ratio so you're taking 16 pixels
averaging them down to one pixel for
1080 P delivery meaning you have a lot
more leeway with getting grainy footage
or pushing your color grade and maybe
it's not perfect but once you down
sample it that far it looks really clean
so there's a couple different perks for
a filmmaker to shoot in a higher
resolution and look just some of them
anyways I hope that was useful hope I
can help a little bit and I'll give it
back to Brandon thanks but resolution is
actually just a small part of the story
here much more important as helium's
impressive 16.5 stops of dynamic
the 10 years of work rhetta's put into
their color science and the
post-production flexibility afforded by
the proprietary red code raw file format
some of you might not know this but
outside of Linus tech tips I actually
spend a great deal of my personal time
shooting shorts webseries and pretty
stock footage that I mostly don't get
paid for but I do it because I love it
and I guess that's where the weapon
shines for me flexibility every time I
take it or it's a little cousin the epic
w out into the world usually with a
ferocious guard dog to keep us both safe
it puts a big smile on my face both
during shooting and while reviewing
footage later this gear was obviously a
huge investment for us as a company but
shooting a mix of our daily releases our
bigger project and my personal stuff
I've been hard-pressed to find something
anything I can throw it in the real
world that it can't handle and that's
ignoring the fun yes I find it fun of
grading the files in Premiere even at
high compression ratios which helps us
save space on Reds proprietary mini mega
SSDs
I am super impressed by how much
latitude there is especially when trying
to pull out details out of dark areas of
a scene even at a high ISO which is an
area where the previous 6k dragon sensor
struggled not to mention that as a
relatively new red user the ability to
change ISO or white balance after the
fact contribute a layer of flexibility
that I'm still getting used to
however this flexibility is not an
excuse for shooting incorrectly in the
first place like any piece of
professional equipment a red weapon does
not make you the next Roger Deakins sure
you can crank the ISO to 2,000 in an
effort to mask your lighting errors with
a high-quality camera and a lot of
people would never notice but to truly
get the most out of it you have to be
aware that a camera has a native ISO
where its dynamic range capabilities are
ideal and everything lighting makeup and
D filters exposure aperture shutter
speed everything needs to be balanced to
get the right amount of light on the
sensor if you want the highest quality
digital negative and that's important
because with red new image processing
pipeline even users of older red cameras
can go back and reprocess the red raw
footage with IPV to for a fairly
significant improvement in image quality
it's still beta but it shows the
dedication to support that I have to
admire ok so this is the dream
camera that everyone thinks it is right
smooth sailing right well actually like
any camera nerd I was more excited than
I had almost ever been to open a box
when it arrived but from day one until
now we've had such a laundry list of
issues with both of our cameras but I
don't have enough time to talk about all
of them so I'll just give you the
highlights our biggest consistent issue
has been with our 968 minimax I've heard
the arguments defending reg proprietary
SSD media it's more reliable and
therefore worth the high cost but any
SSD can fail and while we haven't
actually lost any footage between these
stress-inducing mounting issues and
having four of our 960 gig Meg's fail
over a span of six months I'm with Linus
on this one the solution to reliable
storage remember this is a camera that
might be used for a 50 million dollar
production or higher is not $3,000 mSATA
SSD no matter how much pixie dust is in
them the actual solution to reliable
storage is redundancy to Red's credit
they offered us a three-year warranty
upgrade for both of our cameras with two
free 960 gig Meg's as a way of saying
sorry your seven-inch display
mags weapon brain and epic W brain twice
had to be are made but just speaking
honestly as a customer it's caused
delays in our production schedule and
hasn't given us the warm and fuzzy
feeling that we should be getting when
we're buying the best of the best with
all of that said however Linus might
feel about the price tag we clearly
haven't boxed them back up for refunds
are they overkill for YouTube yes but
does that mean we will continue to bring
you guys videos shot in 8k anyway also
yes we aren't going to turn into fanboys
but the image quality and flexibility
have brought us into the red eco system
for the foreseeable future
one of the worst parts of being a small
business owner let's say you you're an
electrical contractor or something like
that is dealing with accounting it's
complicated it's time-consuming and it
doesn't have to be fresh books is the
cloud-based accounting software built
for how you want to work it's a simple
way to be more productive more organized
and get paid faster you can create and
send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds you can set up online
payments with just a couple of clicks
you can get paid on your terms including
taking deposits through the platform and
you can see when your client has seen
your invoice to put an end to the
