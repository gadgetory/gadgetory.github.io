quickie episode which you can check out
here on RSI also known as repetitive
strain injury one of the reasons he's so
familiar with this topic is because he
has suffered from it quite severely at
times through this process he has found
that certain gear works really well for
him for one reason or another one of
those pieces of gear a mouse to be exact
had a battery acid spill and it
destroyed some of the traces on the PCB
enter the silver conductive pen the
coolermaster Nova touched tkl utilizes
genuine Topor hybrid capacitive switches
and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
these pens are used to quickly easily
and effectively repair PCB traces or
make new ones entirely you know
everything from fixing a relatively
simple PCBs damaged traces like we'll be
doing today all the way to more
complicated stuff like automotive rear
window trace repair and prototyping of
small devices there are two main types
of silver conductive pens I really don't
think these different categories have
names but I'll divide them into squeeze
and push mechanism and the rollerball
mechanism the mg chemicals pen that I
have and similar pens from brands like
circuit works kegs laboratories and
circuit medic all fall under the squeeze
and push category I call it this because
to use the pen you were instructed to
squeeze the tube before actually
pressing the tip onto the PCB in order
to have the silver ink come out of the
pen when you pressurize the bottom the
roller ball pens like the electron ink
get it anyways they're super cool but
not really intended for use on PCBs you
may be able to get them to work but it
will probably be unsuccessful what they
are intended for use on is paper or
maybe even some forms of wood there are
a ton of fun to play with and may be
able to do quick tests of circuit board
layout design especially if you use
something like one-two-three design
because you can easily integrate
electron ink modules which will make
things a breeze anyways Tara and I are
going to try our luck with our mg
chemicals pen so let's see how this goes
well rested lightly on service use with
adequate ventilation squeeze pin barrel
adequate ventilation halation we can
open the door can we get a piece of
paper that I can just test this on Oh
oh hello okay well there you know you
lie down yeah so it's all be completely
closed okay all right I'm just gonna try
it right here if we've got that dead
laptop so you're going to want to
practice more I think on an actual PCB
because you might have to test this is
the one that we dropped during that
commercial
that's pretty good man yeah but it's
still a bit too thick I think you
wouldn't branch the traces that way I'm
gonna start over here
I might have created a bit of a bridge
there okay let's try to scrape that back
oh hey those are perfect yeah you're not
using an esd-safe tool sir oh okay I'm
not gonna blow why because that would be
dumb wouldn't it
uh probably yeah I've never worked on
circuit boards this integrated whoa tiny
thing is just not very precise yeah you
could almost do like painters tape style
like put down a teeny strip of
electrical tape and then take it back up
it's a little thicker than I would like
well maybe woah look at that that's
beautiful
okay do we only have one left yeah I
kind of think that one's still gonna
work I think you want to try that before
doing this run cuz it doesn't right Nick
oh try actually doing it right right
well okay so the issue that it was
having uh motion worked fine the
clicking of the left mouse button
however was milady worked with him
probably plan yes completely fine okay
is that bit Oh the batteries were
backwards wall oops
oh yeah it's clicking every time I think
we got it right yeah that seems to work
okay
we fixed it voila hopefully I was really
unsure about that
yeah like super cuz it just seems so
yeah well it's a like a like conductive
runs were really bad oh they were but
they're electrically conductive remember
the makey makey you could just plug crap
in it doesn't even matter so it totally
works and that's awesome there were some
troubles but for two guys who've never
done anything like that before
I think we did a pretty solid job
considering it works I wish there was
more simple roller ball style pens for
PCBs but as the obvious issues that
there are with a ball rolling on a
relatively low friction surface like a
PCB I'm not surprised
either way I'm very happy with the
results and I think it's great that we
can fix some things around the office
instead of just replacing them not only
is it more affordable but it's a more
sustainable choice as well speaking of
fine-tuning ting is an awesome mobile
carrier in the US and ting is focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction
first when you call their support line
you don't get sent through a gauntlet of
robots you get to speak to a real human
being right from the get-go ting users
will only get billed what each month for
the actual amount of talk text and data
that they use not some arbitrary amount
that they're all loud
or whatever the average tang user only
pays about $24 per month per device and
they want to prove that switching to
ting could save you money as well if you
head over to our link Linus Tang comm
and check out their savings calculator
where you can key in your usage for the
last few months as well as how much you
pay during those months you'll be able
to find out what you would have paid to
your ting for the same amount of service
so if all that sounds pretty good head
over to that link again that's Linus
ENCOM and when you sign up you will get
a $25 service credit or $25 towards a
new device let me know what you guys
think of these tinkerer inspired videos
I'd love to do more so your feedback is
greatly appreciated also while you're
here watching the video dislike like
share subscribe follow comment do all
those kind of things comment down below
or over on the forum if again you think
we should do more of these types of
videos over on the forum check out the
support us link so you can do things
like changing your Amazon affiliate link
and if you want a helpful way to do that
get the add-on the Linus tech tips
notifier add-on for Firefox or Chrome
and it can do it for you which is pretty
cool also become a contributor on the
forum there's a little link on how to do
that in the support us section it helps
us out a ton and you get a cool little
badge while you're posting and if you're
back on the video there's a link to buy
some cool shirts which won't have
minions on them but anyways thanks for
watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
