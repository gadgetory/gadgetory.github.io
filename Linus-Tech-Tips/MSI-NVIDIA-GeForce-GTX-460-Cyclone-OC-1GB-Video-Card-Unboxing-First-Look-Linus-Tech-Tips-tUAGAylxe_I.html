anticipated and has received fantastic
reviews across the web this is the
GeForce GTX 460 and this particular
version is not your run-of-the-mill GTX
460 now I've received a lot of requests
over the time that I've been doing my
unboxings and blog videos to take a look
at cards that don't feature the
reference and video or ATI design well
I'm finally doing it this is another non
reference card I looked at another one
recently so this features and the size
cyclone cooler it also has their
military-grade arm sorry military class
components so you can see here that
includes the high conductive capacitors
solid capacitors solid state chokes as
well as no buzz and this is a really
interesting thing for them to call out
because I've seen a lot of complaints
over the last few years with many
high-end cards that as soon as you start
to play a game you hear like a wine or a
buzz and that's from this style of choke
with a solid state choke a well-built
one and a well-designed PCB you can
eliminate that noise so that if you have
a quiet fan you get here
zero noise from your graphics card so
that's something I'm definitely going to
take a look at when I actually get this
video card out of the box and running
they are also talking about MSI
Afterburner which is a terrific utility
co-developed by MSI and rivatuner it's
my overclocking utility of choice you've
probably actually seen me use it in a
couple of videos even featuring other
brands of graphics cards because it
works great and then let's have a look
at what else we've got
- ok cameraman wants to look at that for
a while you can pause it if you want to
read that I suppose you know what let's
start getting the card out of the box
and then I can talk about some of the
other bullet points that make this
particular one special and the side does
include a three year warranty with their
graphics cards and so just fine my box
fell apart look at that hopefully they
have a warranty on the box - hahaha Wow
like I unboxed it like more than usual
huh ok well there you can click the box
and it's all of its glory just like that
ok so let's get the card open here
in terms of accessories we've brought
pretty standard fare we have a DVI to
VGA adapter a DVI to HDMI adapter we've
got two molex to 6-pin PCI Express power
adapters and then we have a graphics
card now this is an odd one Oh No there
it is I was gonna say there's no driver
disk I don't have to tell you not to use
it to throw it away but there it is
thrown away and then we've got a quick
users guide so that's going to show you
how to install your graphics card tell
you a little bit about it show you how
to install the drivers okay and then the
last thing we have here is something
about the 460 GTX series so installing
MSI live update okay so this is their
automatic driver update feature MSI live
update so they're just giving you some
instructions on how to use that let's
take it out of the anti-static wrap here
and have a look at this very highly
anticipated card so here we have it this
is the MSI GTX 460 this is a one gig
over factory overclocked card featuring
their cyclone cooler so the cyclone
cooler here's an interesting that I
noticed about it and I actually talked
about this in my other GTX 460 unboxing
is you see the shape of this cooler I
called out that it looks a lot like a
stock intel reference cooler and what I
didn't realize is that why Nvidia is
probably using this in their reference
design cards is because MSI has been
using this exact cyclone heatsink for a
couple generations now and it does a
really good job now the difference
between the cyclone and the stock cooler
is a the cyclone doesn't have a shroud
so you actually get slightly better
performance that way because
everything's exposed to the open air in
your case and the second thing is that
it actually has a couple of heat pipes
in addition to the to the fins on the
bottom that carry up to a couple more
fin banks that are going to benefit from
some of the incidental airflow from this
fan so it's going to blow down but it's
also going to have a lot of air going
out this way and that's going to take
away a lot of the heat that these heat
pipes carry out to the fins on the sides
there
cameraman is having a nice look at the
cooler I mean the cyclone cooler is
really one of the big talking points
about this card because and I'm going to
do some testing on it but MSI's claims
are that it is up to fifteen point seven
percent quieter under load and also that
it will cool much better at that same
quieter level that was really awkward
okay cools better and is quieter there
that's easy it has a 90 millimeter fan
so a nine centimeter pwm controlled fan
so that means that even at very low
speeds it will manage to start itself up
which is the problem with non pwm fans
it has yeah I think that's pretty much
everything else I wanted to say about it
okay let's have a look at the card
itself this has a PCI Express 16x
interface it is sli ready so you can use
up to two GeForce GTX 460 cards in SLI
and let's see what we've got four output
options we have two DVI ports and one
mini HDMI port on the back of the card
so that means that you do have support
for up to three monitors in SLI mode it
does support 3d vision surround okay and
then okay I'm just going to take that
right off in terms of power requirements
it's not nearly as power-hungry as many
of the other ferny series cards but it
still does require two PCI Express six
pin connectors on the back so if you're
going to run SLI make sure that you've
got four of these babies and I think
that pretty much covers everything I
wanted to say this is the cyclone cooled
version of the okay I don't know what
camera man is looking at he wants to see
the back of the card okay camera man's
looking at the back of the card I hope
you're enjoying this that's where the
GPU is you can deduce that from the fact
that Samsung I'm running out of things
to talk about here you can deduce that
from the fact that there's a bunch of
components on the back of the PCB and
also that that is where the cooler is
positioned on the front of the part
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the msi n 460 GTX cycle
own one gig Oh see video card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
