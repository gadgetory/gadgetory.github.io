follow-up to the antec dark fleet 85 and
here it is I spent some time tonight
doing a build inside it so I've actually
put my my 3d vision surround rig which
was on my high speed pc tech station and
i went and put it into the dark fleet 85
so there's a couple topics i didn't
really cover in enough detail when i did
my initial unboxing ah the first one of
which is these these are not a very good
idea because it's just a random door
that you need to open in order to get
your cd-rom drive like it's not
automatic or anything you can't just
press the button and then like it'll
open it's just yeah I'm pretty amazed
that that made it onto this case um one
other thing that I didn't talk about
before that I had wrong was that you
just push here in order to open the
fleet swap days I was kind of forcing
them but yeah you just push on this side
it releases this latch right here that
is how to get them open another thing
that I should have showed you before was
the fan filters these are pretty clever
so they just go right on to each fan you
pull out the little tab right here pull
that out pull it up clean it out and
then you just slide it right back in so
that's a pretty cool feature of this
case one other thing I didn't really
talk about enough was the fleet swap
base so here I'm going to go ahead and
open up all of the all the doors and I'm
going to look inside and I hope there's
enough light for you to see in there but
gate ouch my cell phone fan okay so here
are the fleet swap back planes here and
um there aren't a whole lot of places
you can put them unfortunately the spot
sort of the bad news because anywhere
next to these video cards actually i'll
talk more about that on the side I guess
so fleet swap base so in theory I guess
you could install if you bought more of
these or if you just slid hard drive
straight in you could install up to 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 hard drives which would be
a pretty
tremendous capacity but then if you come
around to the side you run into a bit of
a problem just going to go ahead and
pull the side panel off the case looks
great with the red lights by the way
looks really good I mean no product is
perfect though so the problem you run
into here is that the fleet swap base
add so much bulk to the drive cages that
you can install them anywhere near the
graphics cards I mean these aren't
terribly long graphics cards these are
gtx 480 s they're only about 9 inches
long there are cards that are longer on
the market and already they'd be right
up against these SATA interfaces on the
fleet swap pace and actually I mean
because you have to route four cables to
it to say to data to say to power you'd
end up with most of it being blocked by
the 24-pin connector up here and this is
the top slot and then even down at the
bottom you'd end up i mean i'm using a
modular power supply but it has a fair
number of pre patch cables and you've
end up with kind of a clutter here and
then on the other side these are so full
of cables that you wouldn't be able to
slide hard drives in there anyway and
then you can't use any of the ones in
between so the fleet swap brackets are a
bit of a Miss I think but the good news
is that you can install hard drives
without them you just slide them in and
then you gain that extra inch in a bid
almost of space and you can just plug
the cables directly into the backs of
the hard drives just like with the antec
1200 so what else did I want to talk
about on this case I really like the
fans they haven't really changed the way
the fan management is done versus the
1200 you can change all of the fan
speeds around here at the back with that
little panel up there next to this fan
so you can switch them from high to low
and vice versa and i believe the fans
actually get brighter when you change
the switches i'm having trouble finding
one that gets brighter for me but they
do they do you can install a fairly long
power supply you can see I've got a
Quattro 1200 in here and what else did I
want to talk about a fair number of
front panel connectors you can see I've
got them routed through that hole right
there fits very very tall
you heat sinks that actually got a co
gage arrow in here right now and even
with the heat pipes sticking up right
there you can see we've still got maybe
a centimeter or centimeter and a half of
space left once we closed a side panel
so that's pretty good what else do I
want to talk about on this case yeah I
wouldn't have minded seeing a little bit
more in terms of cable management on the
back right now you don't really have a
whole lot of options as the bad news
because I mean basically everything has
to come from it's going to lose the
strap here it is make it hard for you to
hold the camera basically everything has
to come from this hole right here and
you've only got about well here you've
got this much space between the
motherboard back plate and then where
the side panel goes on so it's not even
like if you compare the thickness of a
24 pin power connector to the thickness
you have here you can't you can't even
really route any cables behind the
motherboard tray and expect to be able
to close the case so by the time you run
an 8-pin up to the cpu a 24-pin over
here some say two cables up to your
optical bays potentially some say two
cables over to your fleet swap some
molex to your front fans some molex to
your rear fans you run all of your front
panel connectors including your USB your
audio you kind of wind up in a little
bit of trouble and what I wish had been
included because you see all this space
here like this is quite this is quite
deep the space behind the hard drive
cages I wish something like that could
have been turned into a place to hide
cables because right now you see there's
actually there's no gap here there's no
way to bring cables from the power
supply up into here everything has to
has to pass over this this lip of metal
here we're really there's not enough
space to close the panel over top of it
so that was one of the challenges that I
ran into with this case one thing that I
did like though was that the back cpu
cooler access is very well positioned
for my motherboard here I have easy
access to the the back plate of the CPU
cool
I'm using right now and I'll be able to
easily swap that out if I should so
desire anyway thank you for checking out
my more detailed look at the antec dark
fleet 85 I've got my SSD installed here
and since it's just a direct say to hook
up it's obviously running at full speed
so I've got windows running and yeah I
think that pretty much covers everything
oh yeah there's the front slots so we
got reset free USB 2.1 USB 3.0 front
audio and power oh yeah yeah I should
show you how to hook up the USB 3.0 USB
3.0 behind the motherboard up here okay
up here under the video cards and then
out the back panel through a little
plate that may provide okay so you can
see it right here and then I just
plugged that into the USB 3 port on the
back of the motherboard that's the way
all USB 3.1 plement ations work right
now because there is no standardized pin
out so you pretty much have to run a
standard USB cable plug around to the
back your case there's no other real way
to do it right now thank you for
