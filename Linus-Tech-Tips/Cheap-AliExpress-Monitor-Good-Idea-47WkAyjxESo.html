on Aliexpress one of their appears like
this monitor so we ordered this what
like a month ago or something like that
it was cheap there's only 200 bucks and
the reviews for it are fantastic
oh wait if you look closely err those
reviews are from Amazon and they're not
even for a modern therefore am
understand so wait a minute what even is
this thing is it any good and can you
trust Aliexpress at all it doesn't look
promising but what we can promise you is
that this video is brought to you by
thermal takes a 500 has a modern
minimalistic design brushed aluminum
panels and dual hinge wing tempered
glass doors check it out today at the
link in the video description
so we already did the very cheap feeling
external power brick made by judging
hdmi cable that is actually really nice
to see included metal stand full sheet
metal stand this is really cool this is
you know what functional I like it
having the screws already installed
where they go is handy
I do wish that they weren't quite all
the way in oh it's curved it's curved
baby 3,000 R that's interesting so it's
got actually yeah quite a tiny curve on
it
another thing you notice is uh this is
not the brand name that was on the
product page and this appears to be just
spray-painted oh this is straight yeah
but is it okay so that's about no that's
clearly for no it is not in fact level
it goes it goes down this way so you got
your stereo speakers HDMI VGA that's it
baby
power in know DisplayPort literally the
very worst kind of on-screen display
controls the kind that's on the back
you're supposed to have one tactile bump
and the stupid part is it's not even a
cost-saving measure because it's not
like they took one button and then just
reuse the molding for it there's one
molding for the entire back panel of a
monitor so it was just a stupid decision
it's like this is what happens when you
clone a product without understanding
why they did it on the original product
so they probably saw a button that had a
tactile bump read or review somewhere
that was like yeah a helpful tactile
dump on the button and we're like oh
well they cheap go they only put one
tactile dump we're gonna do five so you
reach around behind the monitor and you
don't know what button that is you know
what though
major kudos for them having a vase
amount even though I have absolutely no
idea how exactly you would put a
backplane hundred there's your screw
again now watch how this works well the
table you gotta lift it lift it there
you go
here I'll hold up for ya alright
incredibly light this is scarily light
okay in fairness to it in spite of the
cheap stand the tilt adjust that it does
have actually feels really solid like
it's it's really firm
first impressions not very strong it's
only 1080p yeah it's fine if the whole
thing crooked hmm yeah that's like 83
but this is way off it actually has a
bit of like a screen door effect I'm
just looking at how there's like there's
a mesh there's a grid that you can see
just on a gray background but like text
looks like hot garbage
oh wow this menu graphics which one are
we on right now and what do the buttons
do Oh No so it changes part of the frame
according to the parameters you set here
to look different from the rest of the
frame what even is this why what is this
feature who could want this when I click
the right side it goes to the left like
this it goes this way through them and
when I click the left side it goes this
way warm use Oh green is what I think
they should call that one that's custom
though srgb okay that seems fine cool
normal and hence full Full Sail here on
what the hell
it must be maybe you don't see it when
you have vested no no I can see it both
hands off full enhance oh it's like
saturating it yeah it's not treating it
ever so slightly uh-huh what the hell
what is this demoing for a second I
thought maybe it was demoing like on or
off for your color boost but it's not
it's demoing if your monitor was
actually broken versus if it was saved
maybe it's meant to be you put like a
before and after thing so it's like this
is us inferior monitors look like this
an arm
looks like that that's not even remotely
close though like you can't even look at
this exactly the competition pales in
comparison like this is this is like
what three bit color lately you know
what I mean like when you because you
can see a big difference in like banding
and in being able to see the
discrepancies between the shades of gray
if you go from like a 6-bit to an 8-bit
panel or a 10-bit panel right so this
what what monitor are they simulating
here where you can't tell the difference
between these colors in black does just
that was fell by the wayside that's a
low priority I mean there's only two
inputs so by this point it's pretty
clear this monitor is terrible but you
guys can keep watching for just more
pain train here I think so csgo demo
mode yeah yeah what even it's all up
here
like happy I think it's all in here oh
my god it is we can't even see the menu
dishonest sales tactic mode it's like do
you want to lie to your customers press
this button to return the dumb one what
off now I give this thing a fair shake
all right let's do it let's do it you
know I don't actually feel a discernibly
large amount of input like like I you
know if we without the makey makey or
something and measure it it might not be
poor which is what I did it's not
terrible are we gonna be able to show
these side by side because this one's 4k
and that one's super definitely not I
don't actually know if we can clone
display a game like that we might have
to run this one at 1080 okay so they're
both 1920 by 1080 they're both
hundred-percent okay is it gonna clone
but actually I don't remember ever
trying to do this cool it's not working
yet
it's dull or lifeless let's be more fair
let's be even more fair let's be as fair
as we can let's try some different
loads or something okay cuz we're in
srgb mode which is not like the most
vibrant mode or anything oh my god
they're all awful
that's just pink go to normal very green
okay so we're resetting this to factory
defaults I'm getting pro so yeah it's
pink it's a pink monitor you can really
see it's not bright at all like the
contrast is so low like this is brighter
than this this is darker here which is
what you want and then this like these
bright spots where it's supposed to be
bright white it's just dull it has no
punch to it so to be clear we're
comparing two monitors that would both
have obvious differences between the
image on their screen and a known
subject like someone you've seen in
person many times well you can see the
actual and the drawn or rendered color
right there right we're looking at it on
these monitors but we're talking an
average Delta II of five point five four
and seven point one six so it's
considered indiscernible to the human
eye when it's sub 2
so that's fascinating so you wouldn't
use out of these four color critical
work but I think if you're just a
regular gamer movie watcher normal stuff
you're not gonna really care about
either of those values but meanwhile
actually using it you hated this it's so
dim and it looked so green yeah I hate
it here's the thing just because the
panel is made by a reputable
manufacturer doesn't necessarily mean
that they are to blame for a crappy
image on it because the electronics that
drive the panel the tuning of the panel
the calibration of the panel all of
these things affect the final image the
quality of the backlight the quality of
the intermediate layers there's really
not much benefit to finding out who's
responsible for the actual panel itself
I guess there's just an additional
appreciation for that most monitors
that's bad okay there's one more thing
we can test though sure if you remember
we hated the speakers on that thing yeah
we were happy that it came with them I
guess they were really bad though yeah
could these speakers be worse it's my
tone do I really need any more than the
windows test tone to know that this
sounds horrible he's not a good tester
with me bear with me no just come over
here just come over here and listen to
it it's obviously bad already that's
pretty bad okay let's try the other one
it's not picking it up I think the
NVIDIA audio streaming output thing can
only do one at a time so see if it picks
up this one you are you are you just
messing with me no you think they're
just grills there's no real speakers in
there they're not picking up I don't
know if I ever heard them are you
messing with me right now
no not are you sure could they be fake
I'm pretty sure the product page also
says it has speakers though all right so
we're giving it another shot
oh my god there aren't speakers in it
well speaking of good ideas ending this
video now because realistically you guys
are no more likely to check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description then you were
three or four minutes ago
and this video is brought to you by mass

back design for a nice natural sound and
better stereo imaging and those drivers
actually come from the same family as
the HD 5 9 8 and HD 600 series

at
link in the video description also down
there starch has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join seriously I'd
recommend anything in this video more
than that except with the exception of
maybe the amazonbasics gaming keyboard
that's not very good toss up there no no
it's better than this it's just I'm not
really recommending it
this is cheaper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
