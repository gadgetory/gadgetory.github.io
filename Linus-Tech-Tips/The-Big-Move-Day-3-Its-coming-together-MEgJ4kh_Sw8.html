exciting and crazy man if everyone else
is as tired as I am and we're all pretty
tired so stay tuned I've are we've
already done the first load this time
from my garage where we had things like
fire extinguishers and OH
cleaning supplies coat hangers all kinds
of amazing stuff also Tarin's editing
rigs you will no longer be working out
of the old office everyone has moved and
we don't have a router here yet but our
ISP has arranged to dropship us one
today so you should have internet soon
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster check out
the link in the video description to try
it now for free
fire sting we had those at the old
office we even had a first aid kit or so
I'm informed so all these systems will
now live on our new camera we actually
have two of these which is funny cuz
that's not that was never the plan but
we got two and I think might improve the
workflows we had people grabbing things
cataloging them and then putting them
away that seems super stupid now in
retrospect so you and I should probably
just walk past this is what it is this
is where I'm putting it and someone's
just dedicated to that area I agree
because a lot of people don't know what
the product like the model number is
there's a lot of so that's kind of what
I want to do so as soon as John's done
moving that shelf out of the way for the
thing to drive back there then I think
we should just start doing that okay
yeah so I am working on getting our
galactically large numbers of stuff into
our inventory system everybody knows
there's snacks over there by the wine
show couch why don't you work with me on
finding things for John to enter into
inventory rates okay so basically
everything on this side
what do you mean this side this side of
the building only the things on the
racking over there in inventory okay so
basically teryn pick up anything that
you know what it is and tell John what
it is
and tell John where you're putting it is
there a mute button for you mmm if there
was I'm sure someone would have found it
by now where the power supplies go okay
I think they go on shelf five seriously
I did somebody move stuff from shelf
side wondering where your power supply
yes did you move them ones that have
been here the entire time
oh I remember figuring that out before I
think that's enough of making fun of
Terran for today all those boxes on
eight on the top shelf or the throne
with the Xbox those are all empties
those are all Lente's and all the ones
on top or empties okay so for now we're
doing shelf numbers for inventory
systems eventually we'll probably have
what individual shelf it's on especially
for like Brandon's camera gear when
there's a billion things on one shelf
but for now especially with how fast
things gonna be moving we're just going
to do shelf I'm like okay I think I'm
going to start entering too because I
think John's the holdup right now is
people waking up behind
I'm the holdup did you hear that
you're all I got talked you around here
hold up hold on one second for
everyone's convenience I've put every
pair of scissors I could find carabiner
them to the shop along with our roll of
tape seems inconvenient it's more
convenient than losing them and not
being able to find them and just never a
lot of favor no no no do you see this
place do you see this place can you
imagine trying to find a roll tape in
all this no tapes right there recked
bracelet drags read their use just be
more organized I have one shelf where
I'm using for inventory and that's
number six another no because I don't
need another shelf and I've already put
all of my stuff on this shelf and then
Terry decided to it monitors on the top
of my shop well taking also removing
some of the stuff that I had already
organized on the top of the shelf is my
I have one shelf how do I show your show
all the way those reflectors bungeed to
the shelf I don't I don't know what's
more obvious like my chair John I don't
know what to do my chair has been like
like bogarted yeah I don't know what's
happening
now you guys have to lift them from the
bottom half or they might settle
so basically we're trying to figure out
how to account for inventory that is
assembled onto something and we guess we
need another column for it or something
so we're gonna have to start checking
out hardware when we need to use it
longer term because right now it's just
chaos no one knows who has what and
where it is so basically we want to keep
the inventory system clean and when you
need something you should be checking it
out as opposed to just take it and go
I like being organized that's a goddamn
lie
I do what if we're talking about
anything it wasn't your fault not
entirely sure anyone's fault whose fault
was it that the camera shelf in the old
place was messy oh that was Brandon's
fault
Brenna's fault it was totally at
Brandon's shelf is Brandon's shell
that's why we call Brandon shelf like
hey what's this what does it say on the
label oh okay I labeled all of our
camera crap for this exact reason now
I'm making it very clear this is
Brandon's bullshit on this shelf Wow
Sennheiser and Logitech stuff yeah dawg
that's for all the new editing
workstations we are all doing it up
except the people who requested MX
masters and didn't get them they'll just
have to you know slum it with g4o twos
and g5o twos I feel so bad for them
please no wheeze or we requested like
seven but they're selling so well that
they just couldn't even send that money
is this an m40 or a 1045 these are from
my personal mouse - I can tell because I
stole all the m-40 S&amp;amp;M 45s unless it's
the one with the crappy right-click it
is not in fact that might have been an
m60 or something
ha Salvage guys well here this one looks
really good have a Mixmaster yeah
absolutely
thank you yeah I seriously thought these
were like stolen those our girls are
they weren't stolen come here no
apparently not no they were just like
regular girls I thought those were girl
glasses thank you bro did you say Taryn
yes no sense of style no no no I'm not
pointing out your sense of style or lack
thereof I'm pointing out your ability to
see ones I'd better go back at I can I
agree completely
yeah yeah okay guys are punished so
dennis is pretty um gullible so he's
gonna be the new guy to prank and uh
it's not gonna be me anymore
Edie it won't be me anymore Oh
the youth last you hole a little bit
more delayed than we had originally
expected
so finish up behind this careful are you
kidding me you know how much in here why
are you naked Ness because I'm too hot
yeah
it's hard here it's like can't be make
it out here that girls naked what point

literally never used it but like gave it
to people in the office I never use it I
like one person that what don't even
think I want it back I only know one
person that's used Brandon this stuff is
