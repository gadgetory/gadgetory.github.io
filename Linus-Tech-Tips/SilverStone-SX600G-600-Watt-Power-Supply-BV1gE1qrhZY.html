power supplies like that ax 1500 I that
we checked out a while back before
throwing it off of a roof to allegedly
test its packaging or something but with
computers trending towards being smaller
and more efficient all the time is the
age of the massive 1200 plus watt power
supply that's cooled by like immersing
it in oil or something over by the way
make sure you're subscribed because our
oil-cooled pc build blog is coming soon
but um you can go now back to this what
about building physically much smaller
power supplies that leverage modern
technology to deliver enough power for a
high end rig without overdoing it this
is Silverstone's SX 600 G a 600 watt
fully modular SFX power supply with
80-plus gold certified efficiency pretty
sweet the cooler master Neptune 240 M
features an exclusive pump design and
their new Silencio fans to provide
impressive near silent performance click
now to learn more so here's the unit
it's s FX which means that it's designed
for small compact cases like the
Silverstone ml l7 that I have in front
of me here and it's got the same kind of
specs that we need expected to find in a
high-end full-size ATX power supply only
a few short years ago except that it's
absolutely tiny hidden away in there
we're talking 80 plus gold efficiency a
fully modular interface with these sexy
easier to cable manage black cables a
single 12 volt rail capable of
delivering a maximum of 50 amps so the
entire capacity of the power supply can
be used to feed a graphics card an
intelligent cooling fan curve with a
silent mode where the 80 millimeter fan
doesn't even spin under 45 degrees
Celsius and both of them is that not
enough for you so because we lack the
gear to do detailed full power supply
reviews I thought why not just approach
it from a different angle and give you
guys some inspiration by
building the most heavy-duty power
sucking machine that we can in an ITX
case so we started with actually using
one of Silverstone's own CPU coolers
here you can see that there's not going
to be a whole lot of wasted space in
this build with CPU memory built-in
sound card and not all a whole lot of
room for much of anything else here
building them this system is very
similar to the RV vo1 so Silverstone's
raven oh one case because the internal
chassis is the same she pulled the drive
cage and GPU bracket thing there's a PCI
Express riser so that you can install
the graphics card you pull up the power
supply and mount and it uses a
pass-through cable so that you plug it
in at the back of the case just like
normal but there's actually an internal
AC power cable that plugs into the back
of the power supply now this is a
benefit of a modular power supply that a
lot of people don't really think about
when you're working on a tight build
instead of having to have the cable come
out of the power supply and then put in
the motherboard and then try to plug the
power supply into the board you can plug
into the board first when you're in a
situation where there's really not going
to be a lot of room to access it later
then you can leave those ends loose and
plug them into the back of the power
supply later on so it's pretty pretty
tightly packed in here we can have a
look at where the power supply gets its
ventilation from the backside of the
case here just like that you can
actually put feet on the bottom so you
can lay it down like this and it still
won't suffocate and then exhaust is
actually out these holes in the top
right here we actually found that it
stayed extremely cool even under the
most intensive loads that we could throw
at it using this system
speaking of intensive loads we went with
an r9 290 from gigabyte it's got a wind
forest cooler on it so we're basically
torturing this system by putting one of
the highest power consumption cards that
we could and then overclocking it to one
point one four four gigahertz in order
to do all of our testing but first here
is just a bit of a look at the overall
finished build how compact everything is
there you can see the graphics cards
pulling in nice fresh air from the
outside the CPUs pulling in fresh air
from the outside power supplies pulling
in fresh air from the outside and other
than that
everything else is just passive exhaust
on this case so what's the conclusion
here is there a conclusion well yeah
there is because we went with a 40 60 70
K we overclocked the stuffing out of it
considering the compactness of our CPU
cooler so we got that up to around 4.6
gigahertz we overclocked our GPU as high
as we could go without artifacting we
fired up prime95 small FFT and far cry 3
and the most we could get sustained load
was about 480 watts from the wall which
means that the actual power supply was
even then only working at just over 2/3
of its total capacity and wasn't getting
very warm at all in fact we took our
thermal probe and aimed at the inside of
the power supply as best we could it's
really hard to get at in there and the
highest temperature reading we could get
from there was around 29 degrees Celsius
pretty darn frosty Anette idol that fan
never even turned on so that was at
about a hundred watts load very
impressive and I'd love to hear your
guys's comments under the video do you
really think there's still a place in
the world for power supplies that are
like these 1500 watt monsters or do you
think something like this makes more
sense for your next gaming rig and going
with something more compact I just want
to hear your guys's thoughts like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment under the
video letting me know the stuff I just
asked before also check out the link in
