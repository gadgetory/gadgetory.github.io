times stock mounts on the wall it
doesn't go on the desk and Venice

things rethink how you're going to mount

encroaching on this person's wall there
is no person there
you're pretty obsessive with your post -

there's not quite enough space I know
he's I can see that's why I was telling
you I can't like I can't I can't would

date no you do so lean further yeah
now that's what it's going to look like
okay well there's that one I guess you
just got to be careful there you go
we should almost just put this one up
for Brandon I'd be pissed if somebody
put my poster on especially they put
into their own spot it's for a good fit
Brenda's poster up in the relic squad I
thought would piss me off yeah yeah but
but no no see that's too obvious
so what looked all the way no you give
it a little job you look at like three
inch of day okay three inches and then
just slightly cook it bring brick one up

don't know where you want though I was
gonna put it like above my bonnet oh I
already know we didn't actually put the
fender I like that Ravi choked up each
other something wouldn't put my know

Oh and then that pin is not actually in
there we cut the tip off and try again
reaction the evilest thing of course I
was very they're the best there's no
story in the news I don't know what I
was actually hopeful okay not just opal
with you time someone someone else
missed the memo about not having ball
instead of what else is that what going
to be creative
technically the middle person does have
the most wall space now that the middle
person didn't even manage to put
anything on the wall that I mean the
middle person is lazy look at we faked
put up Brandon's poster I'm like ridin
oh yeah
we're about good water doesn't say that
I cannot put this on my dance so I had
to find a friend that helped me to make
this and I major it is the size so I can
fit this in the middle this is Taipei
101 building yeah just exactly so then
you want the cable behind the posting
the poster stove yeah it's a terrible
pencil well and that was not nearly as
smooth as I expect us okay there you go
that's it oh that's okay but it looks
like it's good now what are you trying
not to match optin home
oh yes I can I can see oh you can't
okay that's good okay I'm just gonna
hold this you go get a hammer you're
holding a hammer super weird there you
go just be gentle

colors match the building oh that's
pretty good Dennis mission
so Brandon's going to iron this flag
that he has which is Game of Thrones and
you know because I don't know how some
fascinating television right here
Brandon is changing the heat setting on
the iron hope what I do odd you know
every time somebody says don't put this
in the video you put it in the video
exactly and then kind of just love tap
it in
oops don't love tap your own finger
should go right up this is just this is
a breeze it's a breeze hey don't ring
for my client and yeah there we go
yeah oh wow you were really far off you
saw how many LMG employees does it take
the hang of hose how much is this
costing me per minute you know that we
have tax rate
I suppose I'm gonna put something
through it how much did you spend on
that poster
yes 200 don't look like 50 quid $65 Oh
65 it wasn't like it's not it's unique
that's an already hand right no
meanwhile what about adding it to the
space picture I think that posted when
you like see more one yeah yeah I think
that looks a lot better yeah that's good
we go with that
I missed fun I got the most things for
my money I think actually you did too
yes good looks good though I think it
looks pretty good too and you know what
else looks good tunnel bears VPN service
it takes all the hassle on port
forwarding and all that nonsense that
quite frankly even if you did feel like
teaching your mother how to do she'd end
up calling you over and over again
asking how to do it again and again and
again you'd be like mom I just took this
install total bear and then that way if
you want to browse the Internet as
though you're from the United States or
Britain or wherever else they support up
to 20 different countries all you got to
do is hit the dial and you appear as
though you are from that country they
use encryption they make it so that your
IP address gets abstracted from the
websites or services you're using and
they give you access to websites and
services that you otherwise would not be
able to access just because of the place
you live I mean come on is that right in
today's connected Internet world and the
best thing about tunnel bear is that it
is absolutely free for the first 500
megabytes then plans start at just a few
bucks a month for unlimited data just
like that they've got an application for
Windows OS 10 Android iOS they even have
a Chrome extension so pretty much you
name a device you can bear tunnel
through it which I'm sure it made sense
to someone somewhere and if you're
having trouble with tunnel bear they're
friendly support bears really happy to
