you by D brand the D brand grip cased is
super grippy and protects your phone and
their prism screen protectors well those
protect your screen and they're pretty
darn impressive check them out at the
link below
five years ago Nvidia announced their
g-sync variable refresh rate gaming
technology which promised to eliminate
to persistent bugbears of PC gaming
stutter and tearing that is as long as
you were willing to pay a significant
premium to the tune of 200 to 300
dollars for your display and of course
it was only available to gamers with
GeForce graphics cards well today or
rather I should say January 15th when
the driver drops that all changes okay
you'll still need a GeForce graphics
card that's not going to change but
NVIDIA is finally joining AMD and Intel
in supporting adaptive sync the open
variable refresh rate standard that was
added to DisplayPort 1.2 a three years
ago and that is basically exactly what
it sounds like
so you can take any old adaptive sync
variable refresh rate monitor so this is
one right here from Samsung there we go
you can plug your GeForce graphics card
into it go into the Nvidia driver and
boom turn on G sync and it gets even
better NVIDIA has already gone through
literally hundreds of these monitors
with the intention of testing every
existing adaptive sync monitor on the
market and actually gone as far as to
certify the dozen or so of them that
they feel meet their standards and
enable G sync by default as soon as you
plug it in and this is at zero cost to
both the consumer and the monitor
manufacturer in fact one of the
certified once was part of AMD's initial
wave of free sync compatible displays
three years ago it's crazy right now
there's no support for TVs at this time
because G sync doesn't work over HDMI
and
so I guess uh NVIDIA has got to sell a
handful of these BFG DS once they're
finally released later this quarter but
they aren't ruling out HDMI support in
the future either so we're gonna have to
see how that develops now I'm sure the
question on everyone's mind is so - what
happens then - the original G sync with
you know the module and everything and
what about G sync HDR contrary to what
you might think they are not going away
see there's one right next to the
compatible ones and the non validated
ones
so while NVIDIA acknowledges that some
of these adaptive sync displays do
deliver a pretty good experience they
have found that the vast majority of
them will exhibit undesirable behaviors
from ones as obvious as blanking out
occasionally to ones that you might not
think of like just having a very narrow
hook look at that
to ones that might just have a very
narrow variable refresh rate window
that's not actually practical for
delivering a good gaming experience so
they maintain that an end-to-end
solution all the way from the graphics
card to the driver to the display module
to the validation of the panel is the
best one so regular G sync with the
module stays the way it is and gsync HDR
becomes G sync ultimate and honestly
this makes sense to me when the display
has in videos module in if they're
involved in its creation from start to
finish working with both the panel and
display manufacturers to test and tune
every aspect of its image quality and
performance and through this process
they can achieve some things that I
haven't seen elsewhere like adaptive
pixel overdrive across the variable
refresh rate range backlight strobing
for very little motion blur with
variable refresh rate and very wide
adaptive refresh rate windows down to as
low as one Hertz I mean nobody actually
wants to game at one frame per second
but it's one of those things where like
hey if you can do it then why not but
the big question everyone's mind right
now has to be why why why now well the
marketing spin is
we just wanted to make gaming better for
gamers everywhere but okay come on now
I'm here in the Nvidia booth so this
might not be a popular thing to say but
I have a hard time believing that this
is some kind of benevolent effort to
make gaming as a whole better I mean if
that kind of a monumental shift in in
videos business had taken place
I'm sure the Linux gamers virtualization
enthusiasts and folks like us who are
trying to save output list mining cards
from ending up in an e-waste pile
somewhere would have been the first to
notice rather what this looks like to me
is exactly the sort of shrewd power play
that we have come to expect from Nvidia
by opening up monitor support they are
eliminating one of the key reasons that
users turn to AMD graphics cards to get
variable refresh rate gaming which when
done well really is a better experience
without paying the g-sync tax which
kills the deal in a lot of cases as for
the longer term
Nvidia won't discuss licensing and
certification or any other fees that we
know exist for current g-sync branded
products like the regular old
DisplayPort displays on g-sync notebooks
but to me this also looks like Nvidia is
opening the doors in the future for
creating a similar program to what they
have on notebooks for certified desktop
displays now I doubt they're just gonna
turn around and start charging for a
certification that they just did and it
was a lot of work for free they
generally take a more slow boil approach
from my experience so here's the way I
see it going down they start taking
requests for certification for
manufacturers earlier in the process now
that everyone knows about it they reject
the ones that aren't good enough they
point at how much better the certified
displays are moving out in the market
and then they offer to be more involved
in the development process of your
monitor next time around for a fee now I
could be wrong of course and Nvidia
could be purely motivated by delivering
a better gaming experience to gamers but
the good news is that it actually
doesn't matter
oops I didn't drop that I wasn't over
there
whatever
the good news is that whatever invidious
intention was this really is a great day
for gamers it really is a better
experience speaking of better
experiences our CES coverage is just a
better experience with D bread D brand's
grip cases super grippy and features
Lynas proof impact protection in
characteristic D brand fashion it's got
precise cutouts for everything from your
fingerprint sensor to your camera and
it's got their trademark super clicky
buttons as for their prism screen
protector this thing is really
impressive it comes with an applicator
that makes it easy to get a perfect fit
every time it's feel is very glass like
even though it offers impact protection
that simply wouldn't be possible with
tempered glass like this thing is
unbelievable you can literally take the
screen of your phone and hammer a nail
into a block of wood not that I'm
necessarily recommending that you do
that you can peel the prism off and your
screen well mine anyway okay your
mileage may vary I don't want to be held
liable or whatever like don't nail
hammer nails in with your phone but my
screen was still in pristine condition
absolutely unbelievable so check out the
V brand grip and D brand prism at the
links below and thanks to D brand for
sponsoring our coverage of CES 2019 also
