I've got for routers I have a zyxel nbg
5715 I have a d-link amplify a 1000
whole home router I've got a linksys
e4200 and I have a trendnet TW 692 gr i
am going to be doing a range test with
these for high-end router so i'm going
to be using a reference this is an old
netgear wireless g router so don't judge
netgear based on their performance in
this particular test that's just as a
reference so for kind of if you have an
old middle-of-the-road router but it's
kind of old than that to be a good
reference point alright so what's unique
about you to these routers let's do a
quick summary so the zyxel one has a
feature that's called beamforming to
support extended coverage what that
basically means is it uses its three
antennas one two three in order to focus
focus the transmission to where your
devices are and extend the effective
coverage now the d-link whole-home
amplify branded router is uses six
antennas and D links patented version
called smart beam which allows it to in
theory according to dealing provide
pretty much the best coverage you can
get this is a 300 megabit per second
router this is a 450 megabit per second
concurrent dual band router the trendnet
one here the 69 to gr doesn't have that
smart beam stuff so that's going to be a
reference for a high-end dual-band
concurrent 450 megabit per second router
that does not have that technology and
finally we've got the cisco efore to 200
which is well ok links to see 4200 which
I mean come on it's cisco it's their
high-end router right now let's see how
it compares what I'm going to be doing
is I'm going to be taking this tablet
right here and I am going to be walking
around to three different reference
points in around my property and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take readings I'm gonna it's going to be
approximate a little bit guys this is
not perfect science I'm going to take
readings on both the 2.4 gigahertz
wireless network as well as the 5
gigahertz wireless network and let you
guys know how it's going to go for all
the routers on using their maximum
transmit power I'm going to be using
channel 64 wireless and 2.4 gigahertz
and there's a reason I'm doing that the
reason is there is one other network in
my neighborhood using channel 6 we're
going to see how it performs when
there's one low signal strength network
that's interfering a little bit these
are both me I have two routers on right
now don't worry about be doing that
during the test and then channel and
then five gigahertz I'm going to be
using the default which is let it find
its own frequency and see how well it
can perform at five gigahertz with no
interference letting it pick its own
transmission speed so i'm going to show
you guys all the different places where
i'm going to test from and yeah let's
see how this goes alright the routers
have their firmware is updated so here
we go we're going to do the baseline
first that is the zyxel ma are the the
netgear model and so baseline reading
shows us that yes the netgear router is
very strong i also want to talk a little
bit about come on focus please i want to
talk a little bit about the rating
system here so we can see these are
rated in decibels from minus 42 minus
100 with this being better so every
approximately three decibels represents
a halving of the transmission and
receiving power ok guys so if it falls
down to minus forty three one two three
here that means it's about half as
strong as minus forty if it falls down
to minus fifty that means it is
one-tenth as strong as minus forty so I
want you guys to bear that in mind minus
fifty is one-tenth as strong as minus
40-60 is a tenth as strong as that or
100 as strong as this minus seventy is
another tenth of 60 s 80 s of 70 and so
on and so forth so 10 100 1000 10000 a
hundred thousand million so this is
actually a million times less strong
than that according to my quick math
which might be wrong but you guys get
the point okay so it's a factor of 10
every time we go ten of these all right
let's go to baseline reading a media or
away from the router is obviously good
let's go to the guest bedroom and I'll
show you guys where I'm going to put the
tablet when I take my measurements in
here alright so I'm going to put the
tablet right here and fire up Wi-Fi
analyzer now this test isn't going to be
perfect you guys are going to have to
rely on me to approximate in a way that
is meaningful and representative of the
facts because here's the reality of it
when we look at the netgear router here
you can see it moves around a lot so
between minus 70 here and minus eighty
has already occurred which means that
that's that's a ten times difference
just between those two lines so all my
other routers are off these are just
neighboring routers that are interfering
right now all of my neighbors are off so
that means that um actually this one of
my neighbors is stronger than the
netgear one through about four walls
between my guest bedroom and the
computer room there so this is where the
tablet will sit when i take this
particular reading and I will not stand
between it and the router I'll let it
stabilize a little bit and then I'll
probably provide a range so based on
looking at this I would say somewhere in
the you know what it might just be here
now that I'm not standing in the way
anymore i can probably just say minus 70
for that fatigue climbing i might do a
range sorry guys i know this is kind of
dragging on yeah i'll probably just say
minus 70 for that or minus 72 minus 65
our next test the location is going to
be down in the garage because that is
somewhere that i often use my tablet we
got some interesting props being made
down here right now for the NCIX
christmas party ok moving over here ok
in the brush go over here going over to
my racket stringing machine where I
often put a tablets like mush videos so
this with me standing right here because
there's not a whole lot of other room
for me
this is where it will go for the garage
test and so I'm just going to do the
reference score for the netgear router
here let things stabilize a little bit
wow there's a lot of different a lot of
different potentially interfering Wi-Fi
networks down here so that will help
evaluate the routers in some way I would
imagine okay so since we've been down
here for this one I'm probably going to
say something like let's maybe late for
one or two more tix here but this one
looks an awful lot like minus 60 to me
yep we're gonna go with minus 60 for
that one all right we're off to the next
destination and that is outside yes the
great outdoors gamers worst enemy unless
it's like beautifully rendered directx11
outdoors okay so we're going outside and
it's raining so let me just get my
umbrella going here okay there we go so
we're going to go all the way out to the
back of my property you guys aren't
going to be able to see a freaking thing
for this part of the video but that's
okay you'll just have to kind of trust
me see the pretty graph although i'm not
going to hold the tablet out there too
much because uh yeah it's raining and
stuff and right now i'm holding a camera
a tablet my notepad and an umbrella and
trying not to drop any of them because
they're all valuable and stuff ok so
we're oh yeah let's go to the shed
that's perfect because that way i can
actually put the tablet somewhere so my
house is over there ok that's the guest
bedroom right in the middle of the frame
right now you guys so that should give
you some idea how much further away we
are now it's probably about another mmm
i'd say we're about another 15 metres
away so maybe about 45 feet for the
Americans in the audience ok here we are
drop to the umbrella so I'm gonna put it
right on the corner of this
workbench and we are going to see haha
so we saw what happened to the wireless
signal as we moved away from the house
and we can see that for all intents and
purposes it's pretty much crap from here
which is actually exactly what I was
hoping because this is meant to be our
reference and then we're going to see if
powerful new routers can punch through
the distance and space between my house
and my shed and deliver a good wireless
routing experience so we're gonna call
that about minus eighty five now that
I've actually put it down and watched a
couple ticks so what I'm going to do
guys is now I'm gonna take these
measurements for all these different
routers and I will present the results
at the end it'll be time consuming but
you guys are worth it so I'm going to
try and keep this reasonably short but
it's going to be pretty difficult let me
start off by saying that I beat up this
sort of old I call it old a lot of times
this netgear router at the very
beginning of this but so what is this
the wgr614 v7 okay so this little router
you know showed up showed up for the
fight and in spite of its one antenna so
this is a three antenna model three
antennas six internal antennas no idea
but it's got internal antennas and
according to linksys they're pretty
beast d router so this is an N 452
megabit concurrent dual band 450 megabit
concurrent dual bend for 50 / 300 dual
band and a 300 megabit single band
wireless g single band ok let's go
through some numbers here so computer
room guest bedroom garage and backyard
shed those are my four columns ok so the
netgear router gave us baseline readings
of a vote let's okay remember higher
numbers are worse the lower number the
better the reception was ok guys so that
means that minus 40 here that's kind of
a baseline ok so then we're somewhere in
the 65 to 70 range 60 in the garage and
85 at the backyard shed at the end of it
all this was actually one of the best
scores posted in the backyard shed the
linksys e4200 actually you know what
let's go computer room
let's do it that way we'll go column by
column so in the computer room the
strongest baseline reading was the whole
home router from d-link actually no it
was the 69 to gr from trendnet all only
on its 2.4 gigahertz band though what's
weird is it was significantly worse on
its 5 gigahertz band and this trend
continued throughout the entire test so
that's the only consistent scorer that
was best was the whole home router at
minus 25 the linksys e4200 was at about
minus 48 minus 30 this trend also
continued the whole time the 2.4
gigahertz band not performing nearly as
well on the e 4200 as the 5 gigahertz
band so the winner in the computer room
I'm going to go ahead and give it to the
d-link whole home router remember that's
the one that has the multiple antennas
that detect where you are and then
orient their wireless coverage to best
suit you in the guest bedroom the far
and away winner was the whole home
router from d-link the dir 6061 hold on
614 or something like that 645 the dir
645 so remember minus 54 compared to
let's say the linksys e4200 s best score
minus sixty-two is almost ten times
better than minus sixty-two which is the
five gigahertz band and is a hundred
times better than minus seventy four on
the 2.4 gigahertz band to give you guys
some context for that number so all the
other ones are in that like one-tenth
the strength of the whole home router
here however when we get down to the
garage it loses that lead so about three
decibels is about double is double so
what that means is that the e 4200 2.4
gigahertz band and now scores double as
well as the whole home routers 2.4
gigahertz band remember this is a single
band router so there's no getting away
from interference so this might work
really well in a large home in like
suburbia but if you were in a condo this
would not be the best solution because
it doesn't have dual band so you're
gonna have to fight with all those other
people with their with their old cheap
routers or CIA keep eating this up but
it performed really really well look at
this it actually gave up the best score
and
garage so anyway yeah by old I just mean
2.4 gigahertz running on those same
frequencies that are very crowded so
that's what it'll have to compete with
and yeah as my okay might so my
hypothesis about this guy the 645 is
that at a moderate range it is able to
align itself to perform as you can see
here dramatically better than the static
orientation of their Wireless zones
routers however as we get further away
it really drops off one of the other
things I also did observe is that about
this number is that while this is a
little bit lower than some of the other
routers it was always very consistent so
we're with most of these routers I was
looking at a graph that sort of went
something like this and then I'm just
kind of taking an average line for you
guys here the whole home router was
usually like that very very steady these
numbers are one hundred percent absolute
at these locations which is very
interesting okay so in the garage yes
the big winner was the old netgear
router the g router however okay
something to bear in mind you're too
though guys is that compared to let's
say the the links to see 4200 where we
have got about half the signal strength
in the garage on the 5 gigahertz band
we're talking wireless-n 450 megabit per
second we're talking if your tablet is
wireless n this is probably still going
to give you better speed than ancient
wireless-g 54 seconds with a better
signal strength so just because you have
an old router just because you're strong
signals there your signal strength is
strong doesn't mean your data transfer
rate is actually the best that's
something I'll probably want to
investigate a little bit later that I
just didn't have time tonight so let's
go to the backyard shed the only router
that really the only routers that really
passed this test for the netgear router
and the dlink dir 645 the other routers
failed it on at least one of their bands
which means they dropped below minus 100
so the e 4200 just barely hung in there
on its 5 gigahertz band it managed to
hold a line at minus 95 and I was like
okay I guess you probably can't even
brow
the web at that kind of signal strength
and then the zyxel and the trendnet
routers on their 2.4 gigahertz bands
were able to achieve above minus 90 at
once again though these were people they
look like this you're probably not even
browsing the web at that kind of signal
strength so okay I'm going to go through
the graph one more time netgear linksys
d-link sykesville trendnet computer room
guest bedroom garage backyard shed these
are the numbers when I'd split the
column that means I'm looking at the two
bands separately two point four and five
gigahertz so you can see I've done that
so I just want the camera to go and have
up oh okay come look at me and then go
have a close look at the graphs if you
guys want to pause that and just kind of
look at it in detail I think there's
some interesting information here at the
end of the day though what we've what
we've come down to is that advances in
antenna technology or not really moving
that far ahead unless we look at
specific cases like the dir 645 we're at
moderate ranges and even at extreme
ranges we were able to achieve a much
more steady signal even though at when
we got to let slightly further away
distances it wasn't at it wasn't
necessarily a stronger signal than the
others just more steady so thank you for
checking out this little round up I hope
