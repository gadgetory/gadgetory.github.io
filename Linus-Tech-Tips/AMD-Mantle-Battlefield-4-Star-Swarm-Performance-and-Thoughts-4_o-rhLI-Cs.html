to create a new programming model to
fully exploit the capabilities of modern
GPUs to improve graphics performance
that's directly from their literature
the Coolermaster Glaser 240 L CPU cooler
delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more the idea is to give developers the
ability to have their game engines
interact directly with the hardware to
reduce unnecessary overhead to take
advantage of mantle right now you'll
need a GCN architecture AMD Radeon
graphics card with a mantle compatible
driver and a mantle ready game at the
moment the only game commercially
available is battlefield 4 but AMD also
has a benchmark called
star swarm that was built using the
oxide engine that you can download on
Steam now performance with mantle is a
bit of a complicated story it is
supposed to improve performance but it's
not that simple
so I'm gonna hand the video over to Luke
who has spent the better part of a week
testing multiple CPU platforms multiple
graphics cards multiple benchmarking
segments within battlefield 4 and
generally going on a voyage of discovery
about this exciting new technology from
AMD without further ado I'll let him
take it away the original purpose of
this video was actually to go on the
Steam Hardware survey and figure out
what a lot of people were running and we
were then going to benchmark those cards
and those setups to figure out what
tangible benefit people would get now
with mantle that didn't really work out
so well and I'll get into that more
later on but for now we'll go into what
actually we ended up doing to actually
get the results that we were hoping to I
changed from storming the beach on the
Singapore level like I normally do with
battlefield 4 benchmarks and went to the
broken flight deck this is a little bit
more CPU intensive than the Singapore
level is and a better representation of
mantle and we're trying to find better
representations of mantle in battlefield
4 so it kind of made sense the 39 60 X
to 90 X platform that I was running for
this performed quite well and with the
DirectX 11 to mantle comparison when
both of them were overclocked we got
about a 13
cent improvement going to mantle that's
very solid for just switching a settings
in your video settings but when we tried
something that a few people have been
trying which is underclocking their CPU
to see what kind of performance gains
they'll get then we moved the 30 - 60 X
to 2 gigahertz and saw a 20% improvement
which is a lot more solid although I
don't see this being that tangible
because the availability of really
high-end powerful CPUs these days is
making it so that not that many people
actually have weak CPUs the the price
per performance of CPUs is quite solid
so most people even in the budget end
are coming out with pretty solid CPUs
far above the 2 gigahertz range that I
set that CPU - so back to the steam
hardware survey I ran a ton of different
stuff based on the information that we
got from the steam Hardware servers so
that went from Radeon 77 70s 278 50s to
79 70s - r9 290 X's and then CPUs we
went from 39 60 X's to 46 70 Ches -
Kaveri CPUs I had tons of different
setups and mixes and stuff going on and
that felt as random and ridiculous as
the results I got from those setups
which didn't make a ton of sense now I
don't know where to throw blame at for
this there's a fairly new patch from EA
for battlefields there's a new beta
driver from AMD there's me testing on
different levels in battlefield
there's fraps and the built-in tool in
battlefield recording the FPS there's
tons of different stuff going on but
either way these results were not
properly representative of the platform
and I know that for sure because there
are certain setups that should have no
matter what been above certain ones that
they were not so these numbers were not
valid and I'm not showing them and
hopefully if you're watching this in the
future all of those things have been
resolved and that's why I'm not showing
them is because if you watch in the
future and I show all these problems and
they're fixed then it's not very well
applicable another thing to note if
you're running these benchmarks on your
own the best results are shown on GCN
1.1 that is the 290 series the 260
series and the 77 90 if you are running
on GCN 1.0 that's say the 7000 series
graphics cards you mental still works
fine you'll still see improvements in
especially the very specialized
situations like star storm which we'll
talk about later but it
we'll be quite as nice as the
improvements you'll see on GCN 1.1
another thing to note might be that
battlefield 4 isn't actually in my
opinion the best representation of
mantle to really show mantle off you
need a lot more CPU horsepower under
there pushing the CPU as hard as you
possibly can and with that enter star
form star swarm is an entirely another
beast this thing will punish your CPU as
much as it possibly can and that's
perfect to show off mantle so we tried
this out in a ton of different ways and
you can see in every different way I
tried it out the simple switch over to
mantle just completely destroyed it in a
way that is speaks more than just the
numbers this can actually unlock
different types of games people can
start developing things for mental that
they weren't able to develop before
maybe it's still an RTS but it's on a
completely different level because each
individual guy can have their own very
highly advanced AI and you can have
thousands of these little individual
guys imagine playing an RTS with there's
some of them out there but with
thousands of little minions but having
them all be very advanced AI that's
something interesting to think about we
even have games coming up in the near
future that are already planned that can
take huge advantage of mantle like star
citizen there's going to be huge amounts
of ships in one small area with AI
controlled turrets with a is it manning
different systems within your ship that
is in this giant system and it's gonna
be nuts there's projectiles will be
flying all over the place and mantle
will definitely help there as always
check out the sticky under the PC gaming
session on the forum join the
organization we're currently in third
place for total members and work it in
close to second so be sure to join and
just are you excited for this type of
thing are you excited for mantle are you
excited for the games I will be able to
come up with mantle are you excited for
the performance that mantle can unlock
for you
