special product from antec this is the
antec quattro 1200 watt power supply but
there's something a little bit different
and special about this one you see this
yellow stripe down the packaging that
says overclocking version well the
reason it has that on it is that in
aside from all the other features it has
just like the other Quattro 1200 which
means it's 80 plus silver and if I can
find a logo yep there it is it runs very
quiet as you can see they've got their
quiet computing logo on there let me see
what else you know what why don't we run
through everything else and then I'll
save the surprise of why it's an
overclocking edition for later so it
hits it is SLI certified and it better
be at 1200 watts it's designed to
support three GPUs and dual and
quad-core and six core now that those
are out so the packaging is a little bit
outdated computer industry moves so fast
let's see what else do we have 6 12 volt
rails that's hybrid cable management
which means it has modular cables and
then it also had industrial grade
protection circuitry to prevent damage
resulting from short circuits or over
voltages ok and then what else do we
have here you know it's funny that they
don't actually list one of the key
features of this particular unit which
is the power cash feature you can see
it's actually covered but by the
overclocking label power cash so that is
basically capacitors in line with the
power supply cables themselves that will
compensate for any little dips and
voltage from the from the power supply
and you're basically drawing power
that's stored in the capacitor rather
than while you wait for the power supply
to catch up and get back up to the right
voltage
now I should probably I should probably
mention at this time that this isn't
going to be just a regular unboxing this
is also going to be a giveaway we are
going to give away the 1200 watt antec
quattro power supply and there's a
special requirement we are not going to
give away this power supply which will
be unboxed at the time of giving it away
until linus tech tips my channel here
reaches 10,000 subscribers to tell your
friends to subscribe and once they do we
are going to do a random draw for the
antec quattro 1200 watt OC edition so
here it is the power cash a
high-performance capacitor delivers an
extra power reserve where you need it
when you need it most alright let's get
this box open if I can figure out how to
get the Box open and we'll have a look
at the power supply itself things like
the finish the cables that are attached
to it although I can tell you right now
the cables attached to it are going to
be well lots okay the first thing we
find is an end tech product overview
where they show you the power supply and
the cables attached to it and a bunch of
different languages next we have a thick
this is see if I can find it quickly
enough here to do this on camera oh okay
it's rated for 300 volts 14 AWG power
connector using the the non-standard
computer power supply connector so this
baby is designed to draw on a lot of
power modular cables why don't we have a
look at those in a minute after we've
gone through the the perma cables the
pre-attached ones okay do we have
anything else okay do not eat this this
is also in there don't need it it's not
a snack alright we've also got some
screws don't eat those either black
screws little touches like that I really
appreciate you know when you're building
a system with a 1200 watt power supply
I'm going to go out on a limb and i'm
going to say you might care what it
looks like about the little touches so
lantech includes some black screws so
that when you see the back of your case
you're not going to see little silver
screws and then a black finish on your
power supply which is just just awful
just saw okay so here's the power supply
itself we've got a red go faster set of
racing stripes on here with our 1200
markings which means that can go up to
1,200 miles per hour with these racing
stripes next we've got some vents on the
side as well as a stamped get that box
of the way stamped antec logo on there
looks like a serial number there we are
hopefully you can read that next we go
around to the front where we have some
grills so we got your standard honeycomb
grills as well as your modular connector
interface then we have all of our
standard attached connectors now while I
would sometimes criticized a power
supply manufacturer for putting so many
cables pre-attached on a modular power
supply I mean it's a 1200 watt power
supply if you're not connecting a few
things to it then I mean you'd better
reevaluate your build okay then we've
got the label here so hopefully you can
read all of those specs there i'm not
sure if you're going to be able to in HD
don't forget to change to HD if you
can't read them then we've got the
little overclocking sticker there so
let's get to what makes this
overclocking we've got our standard 80mm
fan all the Quattro series use that at
this time then we've got our power plug
our LED and two knobs so these knobs are
actually adjustable knobs so you can
adjust the 12 volt rail to be up to 12
point six or as low as 11.8 volts so for
some particularly extreme overclockers
who want to just have that much more
control over the output of their power
supply that's a very cool option it also
gives you the option to control the fan
speed so from minimum to maximum here I
actually didn't know what this knob did
until I opened it so I'm glad I did this
unboxing alright next let's have a look
at the cables that are attached here so
I'm going to get the power supply
sitting right there like a good little
power supply all the knobs kind of make
it hard to put down like that I mean
usually that won't affect the product in
regular use and it's only really going
to impact you with you unbox it when you
when you get it but I mean most people i
don't think do that I think most people
are not like me and they actually just
use their computer hardware okay well
first thing we've got is the 24-pin
connector we got a nice long cable on
here so you'll be able to reach wherever
you need to go and it also has a little
little booty on it not like like booty
but like boot boot around it so that's
to make it look a little bit nicer I
guess when you're bending it over to
where it needs to go gets rid of some of
the little multicolored pneus that goes
on on the 24-pin all right next we have
oh this is hard to this is hard to
organize actually in so many cables okay
next we have PCI Express yes so these
will be perfect for Fermi which was just
released yesterday so we have for PCI
Express connector so you can see without
actually attaching any modular
connectors we have four including the
power cash feature okay we have a six
plus two pin here and then attached
directly to it we have an additional six
pen 6 pin so if you're running any GPU
such as a Fermi that requires an 8th and
a 6 pin right together you only have to
run one cable to each GPU so that means
you could actually hook you can hook up
for Fermi's with up without actually um
wow that's that's Wow ridiculous so yeah
you've got a lot of expansion options
right out of the box with this power
supply without you making any changes to
it okay next we have also featuring
power cash a 4 plus 4 or 8 pin CPU
connector then we have just an 8-pin CPU
connector so you're going to be able to
plug in most any board that requires
well tons of PCI Express connectors tons
of 8 pin connectors and then
the pre-attached cables because you know
you never know what someone even using a
1200 watt power supply is going to be
using for SATA devices I mean hey they
might just be using a high-end SSD in a
blu-ray so we've only got three SATA
cables pre-attached we've got nice
spacing on there and kind of like this
saw what they've done with this leaving
here I wish they were using a sleeving
that's not so easy to see through but I
like these plastic caps that they
brought on them all right so why don't
we have a look at the modular cables
before we wrap this up okay here we are
so next we have a couple more PCI
Express connector seriously you're going
to be able to like single slot water
cool as many Fermi's as you can put on
that new EVGA what is it sr2 i think it
is super record too that that dual dual
Gulf town seven pci express slot
motherboard anyway so there that plugs
into the two red spots on the back of
the power supply and you have another 26
plus two and another 26 pins that's for
a total of he's got 12 PCI Express
connectors on here then we have some
more expansion options in terms of the
molex and SATA connectors so I've got
two more modular cables for molex each
of them sporting three molex connectors
and these are nice and long too that's
really good and then one of them
actually has a floppy connector just in
case you still need one of those all
right and then for save it seems you
have given us a little bit more in terms
of theta just because obviously it's a
it's an uber standard so yeah you can
see we've got three SATA cables of
varying lengths so they've given us one
that has just to sega SE two connectors
on it that's really handy if you don't
want to just randomly run extra cables
if you've only got two drives and then
we have two that have three so you've
got pretty much any options that you
would need covered by the modular cables
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and product overview on the
quattro 1200 watt power supply don't
forget when i reached 10,000 subscribers
you can have a chance to win the quattro
1200 watt power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
