at a sample motherboard that's too early
for packaging that comes with a driver
disk that looks like this evaluation 9-3
yes this is MSI's military class 3
answer to the AMD FM 2 socket and I
actually still don't even know what the
model number of this board is it's
actually not on here we'll be back in a
moment right so we found it this is the
a 85 X 8 g 65 from msi this is a
performance board based on the new FM 2
socket from AMD which comes along with a
few really cool thing so number one is
this supports trinity apu so remember an
APU is AMD's nomenclature for a CPU and
a GPU on one chip so basically a CPU now
since both of the majors TP you guys
have GPUs built in however AMD's AP use
have much more powerful GPUs built into
them then Intel's equivalent as we'll
show you in an upcoming video on the
NCIX tech tips channel you've got a
pretty bog-standard layout so you got
your CPU socket in the middle you've got
these beastly-looking drm coolers all
around here that actually look
outstanding so i'll get you a bunch of
different angles of those those look
awesome get slick to keep your threats
like sorry sorry it's not slick filming
today it's diesel so there's your a pin
CPU connector and the top left there's
your dual channel ddr3 compatible slots
on the right so this is pretty pretty
standard again OC Genie button for easy
1 button overclocking bond board power
switch on board reset switch v
checkpoints so if you're looking to like
break some overclocking records on the
FM 2 socket compared to other FM 2 users
then you'll use this to monitor your
voltages with a multimeter rather than
relying on software 24-pin connector
along the right-hand edge 8 say the
three six gigabit per second connectors
six of them are right angle and the
other two are your standard connectors
that
right out of the word and those are all
running off the AMD chipset unlike Intel
chipsets we have full support for SATA 3
16 bit per second our USB 3 header is
here for whatever reason that seems like
an odd place for it but I guess I won't
question it your clear CMOS button is
here which again seems like a bit of an
odd placement for it but not going to
question it do much front panel there's
all your front panel connectors right
there there is your front USB - here is
your front USB - with their supercharger
feature which allows you to charge your
tablet or whatever else in terms of fan
connectors we've got one two three four
pin fan connectors and two three pin fan
connectors so you can plug a total of
five fans into the board no problem
remember guys Trinity GPUs actually have
use for all these video outputs on the
back of the board so we got VGA dual
link DVI DisplayPort and HDMI you can
use up to three of them at a time so you
can drive three displays off of a single
onboard graphics card which is very cool
stuff for USB 2.0 ports ps2 I have never
seen a Gigabit Ethernet port this high
up on an i/o shield I've just never seen
that before no it's nothing it's just I
don't know it's just the placement stuff
okay optical audio out two USB 3.0 ports
and 7.1 audio out I think that pretty
much wraps it up now I'm gonna have to
remind myself thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the 885 XA g65 from MSI
don't forget to subscribe fly this tech
tips from unboxings reviews another
computer videos that we didn't get for
the PCI Express slots one two three PCIe
1x slots two PCI slots and then two PCIe
16x slots however this one is only wired
for 8x operations so if you were running
crossfire X you'd get to eight X slots
which is more than enough especially
given on a platform like this you'd
probably be running like 7800 series or
lower and don't forget guys using that
onboard GPU in the APU
you can add a low end video card here
and you can use them together in like a
hybrid crossfire type thing that will
allow you to get slightly better
performance versus running this alone or
the graphics card alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
