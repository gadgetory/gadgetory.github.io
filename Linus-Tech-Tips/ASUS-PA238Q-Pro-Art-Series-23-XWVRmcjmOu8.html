Art Series LED backlit monitor from a
soos that has been around the world you
can see it's covered in shipping labels
and packing tape and yes this is not the
first time this products been unboxed
but it is a cool product and it is here
in the lab so we might as well do a
video about it now I did do a video a
while back about the pro our 24 inch
monitor which we are actually still
using to this day for the very important
task of monitoring our filming while we
shoot so it's actually in there in the
tech tips room amps that's gonna go get
you guys and shove it it's there
trust me um so the reason we use it for
that is because PA series monitors come
factory calibrated for the best possible
out of box color accuracy so an IPS
panel helps with color accuracy but a
non calibrated IPS panel can be just as
inaccurate as as anything so that is why
for professional users a soos came out
with this line of product that comes pre
calibrated so that oh there's lots of
accessories in there so you know what
here bring it back there
hope it doesn't fall apart we're going
to cover the accessories so that
professional users who don't necessarily
have access to color calibration
equipment or anything like that can have
something that works out of the box it
is display part ready so there's a
display port cable that's included you
probably won't need that and maybe will
need that I don't know let's settle on
we might use that we have a power cord
we have a USB a to be USB to cable we
have a DVI cable a VGA cable which we
definitely won't need ok user manuals ok
support CD as well as ha the calibration
report so here it is this is the one
that actually
I was run on your monitor serial number
this test equipment this freescale
tracking gamma values and there you have
it so they guarantee an average delta e
of less than five that's what they're
going for and that is the Delta e values
for all of these different colors so
that is the point of this market
although what that's not to say that
it's not great for gaming as well a lot
of people ask me what's the best monitor
for gaming to which I reply well a good
monitor is good for gaming it's like
when people ask me what's the best
headset for gaming a good headset is
good for gaming when it comes to sound
and it comes to images I mean yes there
have been monitors in the past that are
just you know color accurate but
phenomenally slow and therefore terrible
for gaming um follow with the with the
headset example there's no such thing as
a headset that's terrible but but good
for gaming or vice versa
so while there vim monitors in the past
that have been pretty terrible for
gaming it's not really the case anymore
with most modern VA or IPS or pls
paddles so this is an IPS panel and it
has a 6 millisecond response time I have
personally used the 24-inch version for
gaming is a very satisfactory experience
to thumbs up and I personally find that
the improved color accuracy and and
vividness of the image is a definitely
an acceptable trade-off for any my new
difference in input lag or in response
time of the pixels compared to a TN
panel which if you guys follow me on
Twitter you know that I am NOT a huge
fan of TN panels anything but a TN panel
is sort of my philosophy so in terms of
inputs we've got a ton of inputs that
are supported in side by side or
picture-in-picture except you can't do
HDMI and DVI at the same time so you can
do VGA and DVI picture and picture you
know these are these these and these
these in these so DisplayPort HDMI DVI
VGA we've got an audio pass-through as
well as USB 2 in that support 2 off here
and 2 off here with the intern
hobb we've also got an internal power
supply in this monitor I do like to see
that and power switch alright
what makes part series special well it
is highly styrofoam resistant as you can
plainly see so is my shirt snowing in
the tech tips lab there we go that looks
a little bit better now okay has a
couple cool things this is called quick
fit so you got inches here and here
centimeters here and here and then you
can actually press the quick fit button
which is this guy right there and what
it does is it brings up a variety of
different documents or a variety of
different things that you might actually
have to scale something against which is
very convenient if you're creating
something that is intended to be printed
out a particular size or if you're
working on something that is going to be
an a4 document you can really preview it
in the actual size that it will be and
you can even have gridlines that will
help you line things up according to how
big you want them to be if you've ever
tried to like print a greeting card or
something on your computer you know how
frustrating it is if you actually don't
have any idea what the scale of it's
going to be like once you actually print
it out very robust and the pro our
series monitors have awesome awesome
stands so you've got all of this to
remember this is called swivel right
you've got height adjust up to here
again mark see you can measure how far
your head adjusting should you so desire
oh so there you go just like that you've
got um swivel tilt I don't know what
this is no this is until this is
whatever goes into portrait mode okay
that's that way like that you've also
got tilt this one's tilt
okay and it is very well built it's made
of plastic but it's not like made of
plastic it's just being of like pretty
solid plastic okay
got lots of ventilation holes here on
the back up once again you can actually
measure like how many degrees off you
are with the filters markers on the back
very adorable um I think that pretty
much covers everything I wanted to say
about it so what's the advantage well
it's uh it's got old Freight has a 10
bit temp it look
tables so what that means is that it can
actually produce a more accurate and
more smooth gradients of color so on
really horrible tan panels and I'm not
going to name any names over here but
we're actually going to go look at one
ah you know not naming any names but ah
you know what this demo isn't going to
work this time unfortunately because uh
yeah okay 3d 3d monitors tend to be the
worst worst offenders for this but I for
whatever reason I had I had a different
color scheme on the Start menu and you
know how the colors kind of fade along
towards the end of the Start menu I
could actually see blocks of color like
this like they didn't fade smoothly on a
monitor like this I mean that's an
extreme example the other one but this
is an extreme example in terms of like
not going to be blocks of color so
everything will fade very very smoothly
it can actually produce more colors in
addition to being accurate then a
standard monitor can i think i mentioned
the LED backlight already so it's
mercury free and therefore more
environmentally friendly and i think
we're pretty much done so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the PA 2:38
queue from a soos don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos yeah
it's a 1080p monitor in case you guys
were wondering 1920 by 1080 I don't
think I ever mentioned that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
