powered by the HyperX YouTube channel
check it out at youtube.com slash
Kingston HyperX also thank you to
phantom glass and lynda.com all right
guys I know you all expected the HyperX
video at two PAX East 2015 this year so
here it is fury ddr4 is now a thing and
a more affordable option than predator
at around $100 per 8 gigs ish although
pricing seems to be still fluctuating as
it's still actually hitting the scene in
terms of speeds you'll range anywhere
from 20 133 megahertz 2400 megahertz to
26 66 megahertz in cache latency timings
of CL 14 or seal 15 this is slower than
predator predator can get cast latency
timings down to CL 12 in certain cases
and speeds of 3000 megahertz but again
it is cheaper your voltage option will
be 1.2 volts across the board while
again predator had an option to get up
to 1.3 v for a little bit more
overclocking potential but yet again
this is a cheaper kit
moving on to mouse pads which they
quietly launched back in February they
now have soft fabric most pads instead
of their stick on most pads
there's four sizes of them in 11 by 9 as
they're small 14 by 11 for medium 20 by
16 for large and 35 by 16 for
extra-large which is freakin huge the
small and medium sizes are three
millimeters thick and the large and
extra-large sizes are four millimeters
thick
these pads range from 15 to 35 dollars
and while I didn't have a ton of time to
spend with them at the show because it's
not the right environment to test the
most pad ed Yago may be having a video
coming fairly soon which would be a
mousepad buyer's guide so stay tuned for
that thanks to our sponsors to bring us
