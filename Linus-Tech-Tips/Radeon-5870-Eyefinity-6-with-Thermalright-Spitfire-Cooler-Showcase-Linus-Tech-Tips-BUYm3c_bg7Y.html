follow-up video on the Spitfire six
graphics card cooler from thermal right
and here it is so I've actually
installed the thermal array fan that
they've given to me along with it this
is a 140 millimeter fan and I just want
to I just want to demonstrate the
ludicrous size of this cooler setup I
mean I love it it's terrific but so this
is a Radeon 58 50 Eyefinity six edition
so I don't think thermal right even knew
this yet but it actually fits it's
completely 100% compatible with this
special card right out of the box so
let's let's go over the installation
procedure that I used really quickly
here it's not nearly as complicated as
it looked when I was unboxing it I
thought there were all these screws and
brackets and all this stuff and I was
like oh this is pretty confusing but
actually it's really simple so the first
thing I did was I installed the vrm
cooler so all that was was one strip of
thermal compound off thermal interface
material so that's under there and then
you just put it up against the the
voltage regulators and you put in two
thumb screws with plastic washers from
the back that's it that's simple to
install that piece the next piece that I
installed was all of the RAM coolers so
thermal right includes an abundance of
RAM chip heat sinks so I actually used
twelve of these so I used all of the
regular sized ones but they also
included several long skinny ones as
well as eight or maybe it's six but it's
a few of the ones that are low-profile
so I installed four low-profile ones
down here and then I have another four
over here now something you want to make
sure you're doing when you're installing
any aftermarket cooling on a video card
is use isopropyl alcohol to clean off
all the memory chips before you try to
stick these ones to it because otherwise
you're gonna ruin the thermal pads that
are included on the thermal right ones
and I should also mention that the
thermal tape that they're using is
excellent I did not have any
difficulties with these falling off
after I applied them and I have run into
that before in the past so the next
piece that I installed was just the this
is a hold down plate right here that
goes over top of the GPU cooler itself
now you
install this both ways it is symmetrical
if you check out my unboxing you can see
that both of these surfaces are laps
flat so you can make it so that when the
card is installed the cooler either
towers up and up towards the CPU or it
can go down towards the other expansion
cards and then it actually doubles as a
cooler for all your expansion cards
because you can have the fan blowing
down onto all of your other expansion
cards as well so that's kind of a neat
perk to installing this so basically you
put the hold-down over top you put these
little thumb screws through and then on
the back you just put a washer a rubber
washer a backplate and then one more
thumb nut that was it that was the whole
installation procedure and once its
installed it looks just like
ridiculously massive I love it because
it's like the size of the video card
itself and I oh I wish I had the stock
cooler here just for a quick comparison
but the stock cooler just kind of is you
know this size and then this thing is
like huge
one other benefit actually that I should
mention is that assuming you're not
using a knife in a t6 Edition card and
you can actually get a single slot PR if
you want we're able to get a single slot
PCI bracket thermal rate has actually
engineered this cooler so that all of
the things that are on the surface of
the card are only single slot width so
if if you got rid of this you could
actually install some other expansion
card right next to your 5870 even though
with the default cooler it is a dual
slot card so thank you for checking out
my quick video on the installed Spitfire
6 and radeon Eyefinity 6 edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
