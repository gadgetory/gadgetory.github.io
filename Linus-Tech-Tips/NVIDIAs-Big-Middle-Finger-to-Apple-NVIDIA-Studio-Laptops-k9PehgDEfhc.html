at the show is not necessarily a product
per se but rather an initiative from
Nvidia so what we're looking at right
now is the a su Studio book which is one
of 17 of what they're calling our TX
Studio laptops in what appears to be a
clear shot across the bow of Apple and
the perception that MacBook Pros are the
ideal portable computing device for
creative professionals so what I'm
looking at right here is one of their
new super slim and super sexy Quadro
r-tx 5000 notebook designs where they're
showing off not just the performance but
also the flexibility in terms of your
workflow that real-time ray tracing
along with their tensor cores and all
their AI features enables so with a
device like this instead of moving
something into the scene and then
waiting around for a render I can
evaluate in real time how doing
something like you know duplicating my
couch here or like yeah there we go
duplicating my couch affects the the
lighting of the room here let's let's
make a bunch of couches look at that ah
oh that's awful we covered up our light
with the couch surely that won't do
let's move our couch over here no one's
ever gonna hire me to design their room
here not much is sure but with a laptop
like this I could certainly try for our
last demo here again with the obvious
comparison we've got red cine X now this
is something that's a little bit more
applicable to us and the claim here is
check this out decode debayer and color
6k red video on a notebook in real time
now obviously we're not able to do that
using CPU decoding on the MacBook you
can see once we use up our buffer here
the playback is simply not smooth by
contrast the GeForce r-tx studio laptop
using CUDA is able to handle it
very comfortably now something that you
guys might have noticed by this point in
the video is that these studio notebooks
are not obviously different from similar
gaming models so what exactly is it that
sets them
well there's a couple of things one of
them is that in some cases the specs
have actually been tweaked so instead of
a high refresh rate lower resolution
panel you might end up with a higher
resolution lower refresh rate one in
this case we're looking at a 4k OLED
panel on this arrow 15 OLED from
gigabyte another thing actually comes
down to drivers so instead of delivering
like 20-plus game-ready drivers a year
these studio or these creator optimized
notebooks are expected to get somewhere
in the neighborhood of five to seven
that have been validated not just with
professional applications but with
professional workflows so this one right
here is running Photoshop Maya and
substance painter in this case all at
the same time this is a Quadra 5000
model that they had task manager pulled
up specifically to show that it is
sucking up 15 point 4 gigs of GPU memory
but anyway the idea is to make sure that
these drivers are going to be stable not
just with one application but with
multiple ones running at once so that
people's workflows aren't gonna get
disrupted so we're not expecting these
to come cheap particularly the Quadro
5000 based ones with the 16 gig frame
buffer but what's clear is that if your
work revolves around needing a powerful
computer and you want to be able to be
mobile this is about the most compelling
option that we have ever seen speaking
of compelling options our sponsor for
