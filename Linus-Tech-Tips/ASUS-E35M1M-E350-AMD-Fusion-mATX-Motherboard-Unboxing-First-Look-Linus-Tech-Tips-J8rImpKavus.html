product to unbox I already unboxed one
Mini ITX board but this is a larger AMD
fusion board so this is a micro ATX
motherboard from a soos it's the e35 m1m
pro and i'm going to show you guys what
asus has to say about themselves with
respect to this board so they've got
their protect 3.0 technology which is
about ok protecting the earth which
means it's eco friendly and i'll tell
you right now AMD fusion is definitely
eco friendly it uses very very very
little power
ok protects your devices apparently it
has anti surge protection which detects
over voltage conditions and prevents
voltage surges from spreading in real
time and also protects you so they say
they have special low radiation design
shields that a special low radiation
design that shields you from harmful
electromagnetic exposure by eliminating
50% of radiation so that's their protect
3.0 they've also got serial ata 6
gigabit per second that is say two three
six gigabit per second as well as USB
three solid capacitors on this board a I
sweet 2 which is their software as well
as an EFI oh interesting it's got an EFI
BIOS neat ok so here we go integrated
dual core AMD is a kate that cat is a
kate sure we're gonna call it as a kate
18 watt processor the chipset is AMD
hudson m1 and we're gonna find out all
the rest of that stuff about the board
once we open it up it does feature HDMI
says that's there and let's see what
we've got in terms of accessories so the
first thing we find is a SATA cable a
rather two SATA cables for total so
these are are Seuss's SATA 3 6 gigabit
per second cables which are identical to
say 2 to 3 gigabit per second cables
other than the white mark on them so
there's two right angle and two straight
we've got an i/o shield we've got a user
guide and we have a driver DVD which as
well as a masseuse sticker so you should
throw this away download the latest off
of the assist website inside we find the
motherboard itself and a cat
okay so let's take it out so this is a
very small micro ATX motherboard you can
actually tell from the fact that it is
not really very square at all so here
I'm gonna get directly over top of it so
you can see that the like the
proportions are more like an ATX board
in that it is quite a bit longer than it
is wide whereas an MN ATX board would
normally be more like about here it
would be more square but it is a micro
ATX board so it only has the mounting
holes for micro ATX and it has four
expansion slots instead of the seven
expansion slots that are standard on ATX
in the middle of the board where I would
normally expect to find a CPU socket I
actually find only a heatsink so this
CPU is actually pre soldered onto the
board we've got a nice passive heatsink
on here so you can see the overall
design of the heatsink it's got a lot of
fins on it now sue says for the sake of
branding thrown a little a sous label on
the top of it although that looks like
that would come off fairly easily if you
wanted to get slightly better cooling
out of it you didn't care about the nice
little asou symbol on it okay we've got
what appears to be a three-phase power
design with our four pin power connector
in the top left location it's ideal
location we have a CPU fan connector for
reasons unknown well I guess if you
wanted to just you know we'll slap an 80
mil fan on there you could plug it in
there and then it would be controlled by
the CPU fan options in the BIOS we've
got to do ddr3 slots so those are going
to support up to 8 gigs of memory
we've got turbo key 2 up here we've also
got a 24 pin power connector at the
right-hand edge of the board in its
ideal location and 5 it seems like an
odd number but I'll explain why in a
moment
5 say 2 3 6 gigabit per second ports
here's our clear CMOS as well as our
BIOS chip moving down we've got our
front panel connectors 4 USB 2.0 front
panel headers firewire as well as front
panel audio the expansion slots on
this board look fairly optimal so we've
got a PCIe 16x if you were to use a dual
slot graphics part although I can't
imagine why you'd want to do that on a
board like this it would cover up this
PCIe 1x slot and leave to PCI slots
however if you were using something more
normal like let's say let's say you
wanted to use this for a low-power
at-home server and you wanted to throw
like a 24 24 Drive raid card in here or
something then you'd still have access
to these three slots I really can't
imagine any reason you'd use a dual slot
card in there on the back of the board
we've got 4 USB 2.0 we've got a ps2 port
cat attacking my leg which is
distracting to say the least
we've got optical audio out HDMI out DVI
and VGA are also other video options we
have available to us we have firewire
eSATA 2 USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet
and 5.1 audio although remember guys 5.1
audio with three jacks as if you're
using 5.1 you will not have access to
the microphone in so bear that in mind
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the azuz e 35 m1 - M actually hold on
hold on that's not exactly the MA the e
35 m1 - M that's correct and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings and reviews and other
videos don't forget this is an APU so
that is a CPU and a GPU in here it is a
DirectX 11 GPU and a dual-core CPU
thanks for watching subscribe go do it
now don't be lazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
