adventure was inspired by a post on the
forums one of our users Dredd core TV is
apparently considering buying a couple
of 45 drives for inators - mine burst
coin a cryptocurrency that is mined with
spare storage space rather than by using
computational power from a cpu GPU or
ASIC what this video is brought to you
by I fix it
I fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics

okay so jake has been bugging me to use
the inactive half a petabyte project to
mine bursts coin for a while now see
this one right here is actually off but
I've been putting that off because the
main benefits of the Seagate enterprise
drives that are in here are their
performance which bursts coin doesn't
benefit from and their long-term
reliability which the burst coin
community says shouldn't be affected
much but while mining burst coin is not
as taxing as like a heavy load
consisting of lots of Rights and lots of
reads having the drives powered at all
is worse than having them sit idle until
I actually need to spin this box up for
storage and if I had to replace even a
few of these drives at hundreds of
dollars each plus any maintenance
downtime for my video editors that's
just vomit frosting on a moldy cupcake
then it hit me I've got a spare story
inator with like nothing in it that I
haven't even touched since lime tech was
validating 4k native sector drives with
unread and that's working now so it's
sitting there doing nothing and on top
of that I've got literally boxes of old
hard drives that I mean I don't want to
throw them away cuz like their hard
drives that would be a waste but I
wouldn't trust them with any important
data because they are old hard drives
and that would be crazy so this is
perfect how am I gonna get out of here
okay so let's get started then if you
want a mind burst coin there are a few
things that you need to know first one I
alluded to this before but I'll say it
explicitly now high-performance hard
drives like this Barracuda Pro are not
required with that said though it is
recommended to choose ones that are
rated for 24/7 operation like this WD
red and it's also recommended that you
disable any sleep features because in
this application they can cause
additional wear number two you want to
avoid bottlenecks but you don't
necessarily need a dedicated SATA
connector for each drive so a SATA or a
SAS back plane with a multiplier would
work great or failing that some users
are even hooking up multiple drives in
external USB 3 enclosures with success
number three a decent CPU or better yet
a GPU will reduce the time that it takes
to provision space on your drives for
burst coin mining so it is strongly
recommended to install a reasonably
modern graphics card for the initial
space provisioning called plotting after
that you shouldn't need it and four hard
drives require cooling now you don't
have to run like a server chassis like
this because investing in something so
pricey is going to negatively impact
your ROI time since it contributes
nothing to the actual mining speed but
don't just stack up drives or run them
without active cooling they'll be
susceptible to damage from vibration and
they will heat up both of which shorten
their lifespan which is a really bad
thing if you plan to resell the drives
or use them for personal storage down
the line okay so it's actually been a
few weeks since my last update it turns
out that update number one
that wadding drives takes forever so in
addition to my many core test bench I've
actually had like hard drive docks
connected to all available computers to
finish the process and while apparently
a GPU plotter that doesn't require
optimization does exist by the time I
was made aware of it I had already
plotted most of my drives and update
number two I had reached out to 45
drives remember they were the
inspiration behind this video in the
first place about doing up a custom
version of their excel 60-story inator
with support for an extended ATX dual
socket motherboard and it's here so this
combined with some of the hardware that
I've dug out of mothballs should make
for the ultimate the our ultimate first
coin mining setup look at this thing I
mean if the size of you was correlated
with the size of your storage server
mine would be a lot bigger than it
really is I don't think this was
specific for us no just I we can just
screw children okay thank you that was
the easy part
now we got to go get the other story god
this badminton is great for back strings
floor
thank you so by combining what's already
good about the store Nader Excel 60
which is the low-cost I mean relatively
speaking and compact relatively speaking
design that gives us 60 direct-attached
drives with additional hardware capacity
here in the back for check this out a
large e ATX motherboard this gives us
room for an absolutely spectacular
amount of Hardware in here so 44 CPU
cores that's a total of 88 threads for
plotting nonces we've got 256 gigabytes
of memory because well because we can on
that particular one we've got for LSI
SAS 12 gigabit cards so these are each
quad connectors each of which gives us
four drives and then of course now it's
time to transplant over all of the
drives that we had and the other one
this'll take a little bit I really like
that they've done with the new tool this
mechanism it's got these kind of soft
pieces here and here so that you don't
feel like you're just kind of mashing
the drive against metal it also guides
it in a lot nicer
so the question burning in all of your
minds right about now is probably okay
Linus with all this effort and time and
hardware that you've put in to burst
coin mining
is it worth it and I'm gonna have the
answer for you in just a moment here
let's get our freshly transplanted
drives fired up in our Opie system and
check this out in the last about months
or so with an average of about a hundred
and fifty terabytes of storage we've
mined four thousand burst coin which at
today's price is a lot less than it
sounds like point three point two cents
US per burst so with I think we're up to
about a hundred and sixty hundred and
seventy terabytes now with the capacity
we have and the average we've done over
the last little bit weed mine about a
hundred dollars of burst coin per month
so what that means is if you've got some
drives lying around with nothing
actively being stored on them or you
find some you know wicked killer deals
on Craigslist like I did with these
drives right here thanks to its power
efficiency compared to CPU or GPU mining
it might make sense but if you were
actually looking to get an ROI off of
like a ballin storage device like a
store inator and a bunch of new you know
helium-filled drives opening up your own
cloud storage services probably a better
bet speaking of running your own
business fresh books fresh books is the
cloud-based accounting solution for
small business owners and freelancers
fresh books lets you be more productive
more organized and get paid faster it
lets you create and send
professional-looking invoices in just a
few seconds you can see when your
clients has seen your invoice putting it
into the guessing games
they've got fully featured apps for
Android and iOS allowing you to take the
fresh books experience with you on the
go track your hours expenses all that
good stuff and the best part is you
don't have to take my word for it you
can try fresh books including their 24/7
customer support for 30 days for nothing
just go to first books comm slash tech

guys I hope you enjoyed this little sort
of side quest in our mining adventure it
ended up being a much deeper rabbit hole
than I had initially thought I had
intended for this to just be like an
afternoon project and it ended up taking
weeks but I definitely learned a lot I
had fun with it which is the most
important thing in all of this if you
