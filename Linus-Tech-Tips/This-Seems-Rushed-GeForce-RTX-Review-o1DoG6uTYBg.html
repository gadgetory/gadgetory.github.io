pre-orders are apparently going
gangbusters and I get it
some of you out there have had literally
two years to save your pennies and
frankly not a lot of exciting PC
hardware to buy in the interim but come
on giving away your money without seeing
any performance data is a bad way to
make purchase decisions besides making
matters worse is that the marquee
feature of the RT x-series real-time
ray-tracing it's basically a my a today
so all we're left with is how much the
geforce 20 series improves performance
over last gen in traditionally rendered
games and some discussion about
invidious generally bass-ackwards
approach to this launch
speaking of bass-ackwards not using a
VPN do you have private internet access
VPN yet if not go get it at the link
below and if you do well go get it
anyway makes a great gift give the gift
of internet security
so before we start there's a term that
you need to understand rasterization
without getting too deep into it your
graphics card uses this technique to
turn a three-dimensional scene into a
flat 2d plane of pixel similar to a
photo many times per second since the
days of wireframe and flat polygons
we've added lighting textures
post-processing and more to the pipeline
but they all still only apply to the
screen space versus the whole scenes
world space TLDR rendering a game today
isn't fundamentally different from how
Star Fox was rendered on the Super
Nintendo in 1993 ray tracing meanwhile
is fundamentally different so it's a
simulation of light interacting with the
world space acting sort of like an
eyeball in Reverse so instead of rays of
light coming in rays are actually cast
out from the camera position where your
screen is and then everything is
calculated from there the more rays you
have and the more times those rays are
allowed to interact or bounce around the
scene the more detail you get and it's a
superior method in every way to
rasterization except for one speed up
until now ray tracing has only been
available in rendering software that can
take hours or even over a day to
complete a single frame on a high-end
workstation so how the heck Ben is
Nvidia pumping out many frames per
second using this tech well the new
enthusiasts tear turing architecture
cards the 20 80 and the 20 80 TI include
what they're calling arti cores which
for RTX enabled games render a
simplified ray traced scene in parallel
with the standard CUDA cores raster
rendering so the result is a
traditionally rendered scene with ray
traced lighting occlusion and
reflections so that high
rendering as nvidia calls it gives you a
lot of the benefits of ray tracing
without the massive computational cost
and without game developers needing to
completely re-engineer their game
engines and there's more the Titan V's
tensor cores are back as well for
GeForce these are being leveraged for
invidious new deep learning super sample
anti aliasing which Nvidia claims can
achieve near 64 X super sampling with
less performance impact than traditional
AAA which they've achieved by pre
training data sets for each supported
game and then pushing those results out
via driver updates there is a catch
though
just like our TX real-time ray tracing
it has to be supported on a game-by-game
basis so now you know but knowing is
only half of the battle we also need to
see it which unfortunately is easier
said than done
because we could have the most epic test
benches in the world like this one I
have here in front of me right now that
you're stuck ow anyway there are no
actual are TX games to test so we can't
very well measure its performance versus
not our TX then can we well we'll get
back to that in a minute first let's
have a look at some normal gaming
results and you know what they are
pretty good all across the board the
twenty atti average is in the high 50s
or higher and remember guys this is at
4k Ultra with the 20/80 seeming to be
content with the traditional let's meet
the performance of the previous
generation TI card level of performance
frankly all of this is a massive relief
given in videos refusal to talk about
traditional gaming performance in their
keynote as for productivity well we were
a little disappointed when blender
refused to run on the new cards compute
capability 7.5 doesn't have a kernel yet
but if the rest of these results are
anything to go by it's gonna be good
because these numbers just crush the
1000 series cards and the 2080 even
to match AMD's vega 64 in lux raised
OpenCL rendering that was a huge gap to
bridge so turing GPUs are gonna make
really good workstation cards I can't
wait to get my hands on the quadrille
versions of these guys so overall then
the 2080 performs kind of like a 1080 TI
cool and the 2080 ti performs kind of
like a Titan v a much more expensive
niche product also cool well it's sort
of cool all this performance comes at a
cost
and I'm not just talking about the much
higher price tags than last gen now the
manufacturing process has shrunk 25%
from 16 nanometer to 12 nanometer but
with over 50% more transistors so that
means massive dies with higher overall
power draw and thermals hence the
overbuilt not to mention extremely like
shockingly heavy twin fan vapor chamber
cooler and the beefy power delivery on
the founders edition designs this time
around you guys should let us know by
the way if you want us to dive into
overclocking these cards in a future
video in the comments below
speaking of future video surprisingly n
bank and DNC got an update so text is
now more readable and there's less
blocking than the 1080 TI to be bought
perfectly honest to us it looks very
similar to if not better than x264 on
the fast preset so it looks like game
streamers or anyone else who relies on
high quality stream capture no longer
needs to choose between quality and
speed and there's other cool features
baked onboard as well like the new VR
link connector that handles both power
and high resolution video over a single
USB type-c cable for VR headsets alright
then so what about DL SS and where are
the r-tx on r-tx off comparisons well
that's actually a really good question
so battlefield 5 was delayed until late
November shadow of the Tomb Raider which
is out and is an RT X title is
apparently getting the functionality
added in a post release
but that's that that's it then right
wrong we weren't gonna give up on you
guys that easy so we reached out to a
developer directly with a game in the
works that supports both technologies
and they graciously agreed to come over
and show off their beta exclusively for
you guys originally they did anyway so
this is we're showing off our shiny new
hardware ends and the criticism begins
so they were forced to bail they
couldn't give us any details but if you
want to know what I think I think it's
that Nvidia and more accurately r-tx
isn't ready yet I mean to put the rushed
last-minute nature of this launch in
perspective we got our card and it's
driver at around noon on Friday the 14th
of September this video goes up early in
the morning on the 19th that is at best
2.7 working days to evaluate the biggest
graphics card launch in two years and
other publications that we've spoken
with have confirmed that they were in a
similar boat so like why are they doing
is this someone high up in the chain
having an executive moment is this them
not wanting us to spend much time
digging into these things what purpose
is served by rushing this launch I mean
the thing to to consider is that it's
not like AMD has anything to compete
with the 1080 Ti let alone its successor
so I guess this is open letter to Nvidia
time guys people ordered this thing on a
promise and yeah it's it's early days
maybe things aren't quite polished yet I
get it but you're clearly not ready to
deliver and frankly this is the kind of
shit that gives PC gaming a bad name
shiny badges on the sides of boxes that
at best are supported by a small handful
of games or at worst flat-out don't do
anything and that's what our TX is today
it doesn't do
anything so that's that's what I have to
say guys I can't benchmark goals
I can't review future potential I mean
honestly given your track record
RTX will probably be pretty cool but
this whole situation is a ridiculous
cell phone here like outside of hopeless
fanboys when they buy something people
expect it to actually do what it says on
the tin or they expect to at least be
able to get a glimpse of what they're
getting that hasn't been run through
your own PR department as it stands
right now the only tangible things that
we can show our viewers which are your
customers are then very much curated in
video special DL SS build of the Final
Fantasy 15 benchmark and then a couple
of ray-tracing demos that tell us
nothing about the real world before and
after performance impact I mean we can
stare at them which is like wow such
excite so like it looks like it works
and maybe maybe this is what these
features will look like in actual games
but who can say for sure when we can
only test in a tightly controlled
environment so you're letting us run
benchmarks but you're still making it
really hard to recommend this thing for
the function that is right in the name
of the product because nobody without
that speak about it and will cut off
your balls NDA actually knows how well
RTX works so bottom line for you the
viewer then these cards are strong
performers and that's really good both
for them and for the upcoming lower
Entering cards that won't have our tea
or tensor course but we can't draw a
real conclusion because this review is
incomplete just like the RT x 2006
but you know what's not in complete
thermal takes 20th anniversary it's like
complete which is why they're
celebrating with their level 20 case
series they've got 4k styles to choose
from the VT the XT the GT and an updated
version of their triple chambered full
tower case they
got a sleek modern design with rounded
front corners and tempered glass
they've all got ample room for cable
management and radiator mounts for water
cooling and they also feature USB type-c
connections check out the link to get
yours now at the link in the video
description check out the link to get
whatever check out the link to get yours
it's down below you know where it is so
thanks for watching guys if you disliked
this video then you can hit that button
but if it was awesome you can hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description but we're not gonna go we're
not gonna go full-on do buy it how much
of your life do you want to look back on
and not have had ray-tracing because the
reality of it is whether you buy it
today or you buy it in two weeks it's
gonna be the same amount of time because
you don't have it yet even if you own
the hardware anyway i'll also linked in
the description is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join like infuriating you know it's like
it's like when you get like it's like
when you buy a new cpu but the
motherboard was out of stock and you're
just like this does nothing this does
nothing until I have the rest of the
pieces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
