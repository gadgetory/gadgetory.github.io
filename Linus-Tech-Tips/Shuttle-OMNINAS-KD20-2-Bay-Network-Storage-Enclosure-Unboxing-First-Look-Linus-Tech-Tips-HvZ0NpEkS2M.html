the shuttle Omni nas which is your own
private cloud it gives you mobility it's
cool it's stylish dual core and ease of
use this is not a this is a grammatical
anomaly because these should all be
these should all be kind of the same
thing so it should say mobile cool
stylish powerful and easy to use or it
should say mobility coolness style
stylishness I don't know whatever ok
don't worry about it
this is the KD 20 is a tube a NASA
support single or dual three-and-a-half
inch hard drives up to a total of 8
terabytes and Beyond raid 0 raid 1 j-bot
and single hard drive modes are
available performance is 75 / 55
megabytes reads and writes remote access
from iPhone iPad and Android devices it
has a media server a print server and an
iTunes server auto copy feature for USB
3 and card reader that's handy actually
Bluetooth downloads without a PC no way
it has bluetooth on it oh I didn't know
that ok cool
Omni Touch hot swap button connectors 1
USB 3 2 USB 2 an SD card reader and
let's open this bad boy up so what do
they mean by your own private cloud
well they mean that through the apps
that are included are well not included
obviously you can't include an app but
you could make it available on the App
Store and on Google Play so through the
apps that are available for the device
you can access your files and your
pictures and your music and all that
kind of cool stuff on the go much like
you could if you started in the cloud
however instead of relying on a paper
use cloud service or you know something
where you have to upload all your files
to someone else so you don't know and
don't necessarily trust you can build
your own cloud for the cost of an omni
NAS and a couple of hard drives
here are your hard drive mounting screws
here is your Gigabit Ethernet cable here
is your power connector and here is the
cord that goes with it so you get plugs
into there I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do
it wait for it I'm gonna try to do it
oh just like that okay they also include
a Quick Start Guide user manual and Omni
Nast finder utility these can be handy
these finder utilities because sometimes
stuff just doesn't show up until you use
the finder utility like it's so stupid
my Netgear switch I have a smart switch
could not find it without the finder
utility now the finder utility doesn't
even work good thing I configured it
already alright Quick Start Guide shows
you how to quickly get started
installation of drives is as simple as
screwing in a drive and sliding in the
whole thing but we'll show you that once
we open it up power button yeah okay
this is all stuff we should be able to
figure out relatively easily plug the
thing into the thing and the things into
the other things okay powering on the
system press the power button to power
it on these are like instructions for my
mom which is good although you know what
I really still don't think she could
handle it and I hope my mom's not
watching this video because she thinks
she's tech savvy alright so there's the
power button you can tell from that
symbol my mom still can't figure that
out to give you some idea she'll be like
oh the power buttons not labeled I'm
like ma that with that symbol that means
power on everything USB 3 I do I love my
mother I really do just she can't do
that
SD card reader so you must be indicator
your hard drive activity indicators for
hard drives 1 &amp;amp; 2 the push here is
clearly labeled although you know what
she could probably figure that it okay
and then you can easily pull out the
trays where you can screw in the hard
drives very very easily I use these ones
right here not compatible to half inch
drives although most people aren't using
those for storage at this point in time
you can see the SATA interface at the
back you can also see everything is sort
of well perforated so you shouldn't have
any trouble of ventilation in here
however I would like to there you go
pretty straight port I'd like to check
out aha we have a 60 ml cooling fan in
the back so that'll take care of keeping
things cool DC and Kensington lock
Gigabit Ethernet two USB 2.0 ports more
events down here and something that I
haven't brought up yet and that is the
very gorgeous
aluminum check that out thick anodized
aluminum piece that goes
all the way from the bottom to the top -
or rather to the side and then to the
top and looks just outstanding so this
will look great next to you on your desk
or under your desk it will be durable or
whatever else you need to do with it and
yeah love those nice little touches
because it just sets it apart from all
the cheap plastic Nazz boxes that are
out there because it's made of aluminum
it's also very cold very soothing so I
think that pretty much covers it this
isn't rocket science it's an ass it's a
tube a knives it's not unreasonably
expensive there's apps that go along
with it thank you for checking out my
