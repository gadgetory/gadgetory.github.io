another weigh-in show how's it going
hope your days been great we got some
news for you such news Intel invest a
billion dollars to meet 14 nanometer
demand this year billion on us also the
Amazon anti-union video has leaked they
sent it to Whole Foods or something
controversial Elon Musk getting sued not
by did some little backyard yokel either
by the SEC Securities and Exchange
Commission cuz you know he's been
fraudulent yeah we'll get into that no
sex no drugs no violence no money from
me then uh on Apple's streaming service
we'll talk about that later as well
sorry the UH truck
what they got a sandwich
but remember sound porcelain
so I do
I do remember sound board prank calls
yeah remember they sounded so bad to the
people who are getting involved if you
have the sound board you're sitting
there you got your computer speaker up
to the phone you're just going hi how
are you I'm a cop you idiot and the
person you're losing it
you're losing it the person on the phone
is like huh it sounds that like a
terrible speaker I used to love what was
it called so there was the Ventrilo
voice service I used to love Vint real
oh is that like or type in and it speaks
out no no no this is like like before
discord
I think teamspeak I don't know if
teamspeak was around when the trio was
originally around but like they
eventually became like the two platforms
for a while many people kind of left
entry low and it was teamspeak for a
while and then sky parents other kind of
stuff came around and that discord
finally got rid of Skype oh my junk but
back in the day mmm there was Ventrella
the name is ringing a bell and just
don't know and one of my favorite things
used to be because you could bind keys
on your keyboard to sound bored to play
through that so it totally got rid of
that like quality issue that you were
just talking about yeah and people I
guess I could have a levels issue still
you could but if people like tone and
animal like and stuff and there was
people who would do Ventrilo pranks oh
yeah that's oh wait is that the one
the Duke Nukem one yes yeah yeah yeah
this was amazing
yeah yeah it's real harassment yeah
that's what they call it Duke Nukem
style you know put that on your screen
put it up yeah there's a Ramos one and
Chula pranks this Duke Nukem style one
was huge ahh okay the person he's
talking to on that one is it nine
million views and this was uploaded in
2007 is that a boy or girl this was big
that he's talking to you I did I always
thought it was a young boys well I think
it's a girl we can't you know people
knows people is is there a name for the
person like Debbie or something I don't
know
whoa all right we're not gonna play it
I'm gonna chew gum I love that everyone
should watch that person's angry but
there's there's some really good ones
one of my favorite one is just someone
has a sound board of this like random
girl just talking about nothing
important
and it was my fear because he would just
jump into channels and you know like the
classic nerd like oh my god girl yeah oh
and it would just be like yeah like on
Fridays sometimes me my friends will
like go to the store and I'll like buy a
chocolate bar and if one's like oh yeah
that's so cool I've heard that one time
we were prank people with the sound
boards and we're just about done and
then my friend goes one more one more
one more and he dials it in and we're
using a sound board from the movie phone
booth okay yeah it was a keeper southern
movie with Colin Colin Farrell right so
this name Will Ferrell Colin Farrell no
not chrome doesn't do from Pride and
Prejudice anyway don't know there's a
dude in a phone booth and then the guy
he's talking on the phone it allegedly
has a sniper rifle pointed at him so he
stays in the phone booth the whole time
yeah so there's a sound board based on
that and it's a creepy sound board and
that we call this person and it's a
woman who answers and then the sound
board is real creepy it's saying like
Cohen Ferrell yeah I have a 32 caliber
or like some of our sniper rifle pointed
directly at you it like oh goodness I
obviously got nuts I don't know guns
like that's like stats are wrong or
every but it's really bad like you've
gotten a lot of trouble for this and I
saw okay it's like mildly funny we
practice personally hang up a little
while later so as soon as I tell you
what happens next you're gonna
understand what happened but I didn't
understand for weeks a few weeks later
or a while later my mom was like like
your friends tell your friends not the
call here or like someone some creep
called me and told me all this stuff
smells like shut up mom what are you
talking about and then I was like my
buddy I pranked my own mom my friend
typed in my mom's number and I didn't
even I remember
I remember when she picked up thinking
like but I didn't actually recognize the
voice and yeah I pranked my own mom and
then I didn't even realize oh there's so
many points in the story where I could
have realized that's hilarious that was
pretty bad anyways actual topics if you
want to go down an awesome hilarious
rabbit hole on YouTube and you don't
mind some bad language because sometimes
the the people react and get pretty
angry
check out Ventrilo harassment really
funny some of them suck but some of them
are really funny but here's the other
thing about my mom she thought it was
real she didn't know was the soundboard
like everybody else
mmm she's like she may not have thought
that that was actually happening to her
but she thought that she was talking to
a person not a write on sound board so I
remember being like alright anyway real
dude yeah my favorite one if you guys
can find it is a guys talking in WoW and
one of his friends records him talking
over venturi low and just plays back
himself talking just to like mess of
them and there was one part where he
goes like I think it's like three
strengths like three strengths three
strand leather belts and then goes like
good and the guy recorded like that
weird his like weird voice thing at the
end and his statement and just
constantly played it back to him just
drives my hilarity no you say that it
all makes sense I have a friend who used
to say those words all the time and I
never knew what it was from another belt
things yeah yeah hilarious this is like
a decade ago it's I haven't heard it in
probably yeah like 10 years so I don't
know the exact line but it's something
like that
there's all those you ever have those
weird memes like you say for years and
years and you don't even like I I'm not
even sure if I saw this video but one
thing I still say once a while is oh my
god I love the map dust it's just like a
same deal but from CS level 18 for
strength to Stan leather belt yeah there
we go
heck yeah I love it anyways the Intel
they invest a billion dollars to meet 14
nanometer demand Bob Swann HL CFO and
interim CEO if you want
previous wine shows you'll know that the
CEO left the company issued an open
letter to the company's customers and
partners today in the letter he
addressed
light-tight Supply on some of the
company's products mainly their lower
and entry-level stuff they admit it
outlining the set of actions until it's
taking to tackle this problem
he said these that there is a surprising
return to pc tam or the total
addressable market like the amount of
people interested in buying as far as I
know there's there's yeah there's
there's PC Tam growth which there hasn't
been since I believe yeah 2011 it's
modest growth modest like in his letter
he cites all these different stats of
like our cloud computing business grew
25 percent this year or something else
grew 43 percent but then they don't say
what the PC business grew they just say
think modest growth I think the point
isn't necessarily that it's like it's so
huge it's that it's growing at all we
haven't had any PC Tam growth since the
20s so for like the last 7 years so
that's that that is a pretty big deal
regardless and it wasn't expected as it
hasn't happened in seven years
and a lot of speculators have been
saying that it wouldn't but they're
thinking that it's just it's fairly
natural it's from the interest of people
into gaming and all these other things
well the spin that he puts on is that
like they're doing such a dang good job
that people are so interested in the new
CPUs that everybody wants to upgrade
totally man yeah that's definitely it
maybe it's just that everyone's 2600
case or just finally getting too old
maybe that's it there's also Intel is
also prioritizing production of Xeon and
core processors to serve the high
performance segments of the market we'll
get into why that matters later and
supply in general is tight particularly
like we already said in the entry-level
PC market Intel believes they have at
least the supply to meet the full year
revenue outlook expected in July which
was 4.5 billion higher than their
January expectations
so this reassurance that he issued
everybody apparently has inspired
confidence because their stock price
went up like between 3 and 5% at the
same time that AMD's went down
so it appears to be a zero-sum game so I
guess Intel went from like forty five to
forty seven dollars and then AMD went
from thirty three to thirty or something
like that last time I checked it was a
few hours ago though so I guess it since
it's good people believe the Bob Swan
well why don't we break down this
exactly what's happening here from a
manufacturing perspective so when you're
running in a fab there's a certain
amount of wafers of CPU cores you can
make or dyes you can make per month
essentially that's your output is how
many of these wafers you can put out per
month and a CPU that has way more cores
on it is like literally gonna physically
take up more of that wafer right so if
they want to run away for is gonna have
fewer dies on it if they want to have
these bigger CPUs which they are because
they're worth more money to them where
they get more profit and there is an
increase of demand for those CPUs I
think AMD has done a great job of
marketing CPUs with higher core counts
which is great because that's awesome
because I think everyone wants that and
people are jumping on board and wanting
Intel's version of those kind of high
core count CPUs as well which is
increasing demand and taking up more
space on these wafers right you also
brought up something earlier which is
where like if you take up like like you
need a block so if you take up a corner
yeah it's like if you had a bucket and
you're filling it with Lego and you had
those giant Lego pieces you might only
get like eight of them in your bucket
yeah but if you have the same like
weight of Lego blocks but there are tiny
pieces you could they would all just fit
in so much more nicely which is why
they're gonna mix like there's the
binning process and they're gonna mix up
like they're gonna have some of the
smaller ones edging out corners and the
bigger ones and stuff but as you put
more of these bigger ones in you're
reducing the over amount so you overall
amount of real estate like the absolute
number of of course you can put on a
wafer is reduced when the die size is
bigger but there you're saying they're
gonna mix them up you ever seen one of
those cross-sections I used to work at a
place in forestry and they had a poster
on the wall that showed a cross-section
of like I guess it was like a lumber
inish
industry poster Oh like how they log
like how to log down and they show it
all the little like two-by-fours a
two-by-four go go there and a 4x6 will
come out of the middle yeah that might
be relatable to you I love those like
explosion things yeah well when you take
like a car or a lot oh yeah or whatever
and you explode it you pull all the
parts apart so you can see like where
everything is let's go I think I know
what poster you're talking about I think
I've seen the same thing oh yeah every
kid yeah that on their wall we're all
from like forest land so yeah each each
way for kind of multiple TV uses we're
saying this is just a bunch of what we
were just saying yes so all of that is
on on the 14 nanometer die so they are
trying to impress allocate yeah yeah the
14 nanometer node I should say and
they're trying to get as many of the
fabs on the 14 nanometer node to produce
these high-end koruna and Zeon 28 core
chips what happened because of that was
that the low end of the market like the
what is it the HC L 3
yeah no H 3 10 C Jesus that a lower-end
chip caught the shaft because it's on
the same node but it's not getting any
priority because it doesn't make them as
much money so in order to meet demand
for that they made it a completely new
node a 22 nanometer version just to get
the supply up of that meanwhile they're
still trying to focus on the 10
nanometer node which they say they're
making gains on I don't think that
they're gonna they can't afford to not
spend money on that yeah so this new
this new billion dollars that's just on
top of it's on top of 14 billion that
they already they already put out for
cap expenditure in 2018 so this total of
15 billion is actual record and this
billion dollars can be put into the
various fabs in Oregon Arizona Ireland
and Israel that produce on the 14
nanometer node is it crazy how much is
that gonna make a difference is it a lot
no one knows how they're spending the
money yeah that's the thing yeah and
where is the money coming from
is it just in their own coffers I mean
probably they do you think they had just
enough like revenue kicking around do
they have to take or shareholder
dividends
I don't it do this is probably allocated
from a different well just we'll just
drop a cool billion boom
yeah I'm sure they've got money in
reserve and if they're like hey we need
to crank up production because we're
just gonna make a ton of money because
we'll sell everything that we make if we
crank up production with a billion
dollars then that's a pretty safe bet I
guess if they're like we are not going
to be able to produce enough it's lower
attached supply yeah exactly and then if
they're and if they're like hey we can
spend a billion dollars and that will
make it so that we can produce enough to
match the demands then they're just like
hey well we just get to sell a whole
crap ton more CPUs yeah and make up the
money they must have the money sitting
around because if they if it was the
case that they had to like dude how much
I'll back their own stock then you would
have seen the stock price dip and that
didn't happen so it can't be that you
know this is one of my favorite things
to look at you're googling what are you
googling how much money does Nintendo
have in the bank that's only as of 2015
now so we can see what you're looking at
no I know I just want to look up the
number so like one of my favorite things
to talk about every once in a while is
Nintendo because Nintendo
I suspect compared to Intel they're a
relatively small company in terms of
capex or our market cap market cap
capital expenditure as well for sure
probably even literally just like
employees I don't know but I'm assuming
they're a much smaller company we can
look this up yeah but people will always
talk about like during the WiiU phase
yeah and Nintendo is very spiky and
during the WiiU phase people were always
talking about like isn't it turned out
we even going to survive but they've got
so much money in the bank
what like yeah you can see my jaw
dropped is intended way bigger no
Nintendo had from the fiscal year 2010
to 2018 Nintendo okay Nintendo had a
total of fifty five hundred employees
5500 employees dude cactus Club has five
thousand employees and no one in the US
even knows what that is okay yeah like
they're they're a pretty lean company
and they've got billions in the bank and
people will be like oh we use doing that
isn't in time they're gonna die it's
like no dude I can't rember what the
stats are but there's something like if
Nintendo just immediately stopped
selling everything now and keeps their
capital expenditure at the same amount
and just makes no money at all they
could survive for like a hundred years
or something it's like she seems like a
natural fit because their products are
always so bold and risky like they don't
when they reach when they launched the
Wii they have no idea if people are
gonna like it or not yeah and same the
switch it's completely out there it
seems like you better have some money
for a rainy day yeah you can they do and
then they've done really well enough
times they've just got all this money
that you can sit on and keep taking risk
which is cool it's one of the reasons
why I love an attendant that is cool so
with tactic Club
what is cut it's just a cactus Club it's
just a restaurant in Canada well now I'm
gonna get the numbers I'm on Wikipedia
now and it confirmed 5,500 for
Nintendo's employee number until 106,000
yeah so that sort of said like like
drastically different style companies
and even Nintendo could drop that
billion and be completely fine
I think iBM has no three underneath
380,000 which is that means there's more
people in the world working for IBM than
holding Icelandic passports there are
fewer Icelanders than IBM employees
there might be some overlap there I
wonder how many Icelandic IBM employees
there are hit us up on super chat yeah
you're an Icelandic IBM employee toss us
some of that old school computer money
hey give us then that model and money
yeah from the north are we are we done
this topic yeah okay we're gonna move on
so did it I think did we talk about the
22 nanometer stuff yep and the stock
change yep cool yeah thank we're good
yeah moving on
Amazon has an anti-union video that has
leaked allegedly because they're only
sort of
leaked it's sort of leaked so Gizmodo
broke the story okay
and they say that they obtained a video
from anonymous sources they posted
screenshots that gives motive but they
did not post the video themselves
because they say that the quote they
post the video that it would compromise
the people who leaked it so they have
made themselves have reached out to
Amazon to ask Amazon to publish the
video that's correct
and also it's kind of fishy because it's
kind of like political then because
amazon has its enemies oh yeah like in
business and in politics so that's okay
let's get it that's just unwrapped yeah
what this is new site gizmo has obtained
what it calls a 45-minute union-busting
training video so Amazon uses training
videos all the time like cartoon eyes
animated videos to Train management and
lower level employees and everything
yeah
allegedly this video was produced I
think by Amazon and then sent to team
leaders of Whole Foods last week and
Whole Foods of course is owned by Amazon
now they sold them or Amazon bought
Whole Foods for 13 billion last year
13.7 billion dollars who less than
whatsapp was worth to Facebook yeah that
was 16 so the the videos narrator states
that the video is specifically designed
to give you the manager of Whole Foods
the tools that you need for success when
it comes to labor organizing so it all
well I'll go over some some of the other
stuff that it also states it also says
we are not anti-union but we are not
neutral either
have no idea what that's supposed that
means you're anti-union yeah pretty much
we do not believe quote-unquote this is
not me saying this quote-unquote we do
not believe unions are in the best
interest of our customers our
shareholders or most importantly our
associates meaning employees yeah
associates our employees our business
model is built upon speed innovation and
customer obsession things that are
generally not associated with union when
we lose sight of those critical focus
areas we jeopardize
everyone's job security yours mine and
the associates so the video provides
some background on the neighbor are the
national labor relations act as well as
showing some like different warning
signs so if you are a manager at this
Whole Foods and you see any of the
following you might have potential Union
not like unfolding in your hands or
about to erupt so a warning signs such
as use of words like living wage and
steward distribution of petitions and
flyers associates raising concerns on
behalf of their co-workers mmm that's
big one-oh or even more blatant wearing
Union t-shirts hats or jackets workers
who aren't normally connected to each
other suddenly hanging out together
won't make frank's with people that
you're not already friends with okay any
other associate behavior that is out of
character that's a little police state
II that's I try to like I try to make it
so that people at full plain are friends
because I want everyone to be friendly
maybe I'm doing the wrong thing well if
it comes from the top then it's it's not
a warning sign okay the video then ask
managers to listen to ten hypothetical
employees and select whether their
remarks constitute a warning sign or
interest interaction so they sit and
then they talk about what you're allowed
to speak so what are you're allowed to
say to employees that is legal
so apparently basically anything goes
there's nothing really unlawful that you
can say in regards to unionizing but
they still give you some guidelines such
as you would never threaten to close
your building just because associates
joined a union but you might need to
talk about how having a union could hurt
innovation which in turn could hurt
customer obsession which ultimately
could threaten the building's continued
existence potential organization are
supposed to be escalated oh yeah so if
you see this happening at your store
you're supposed to escalate this to
human resources and general managers
immediately quash it nip it in the bud
the video itself does not appear to be
publicly available online as we already
yeah I tried to go live leak and stuff
like that it might
now this was like five hours ago but
yeah it doesn't appear to be available
Gizmodo like you already said amazon
publish this video and yeah basically
the rest of it is just what was already
spoken about so you have a you have a
hot take I have some problems with this
okay
okay full disclosure first unions are
awesome
whose lights just died sometimes they're
really really important when you need a
union you need a union
I'm not anti-union at all but I'm also
not pro Union it depends it depends in
an ideal world to be no unions because
in an ideal world every employer would
treatment would would it would treat
their employees really well now the fact
that this story when you read about it
like I had to really scrutinize this
article to to figure out like oh this is
actually talking about Whole Foods it's
not talking about Amazon because it's it
only says that like in one place near
the top and one place near the bottom
and the rest is it talks about Amazon's
track record it's like people peeing in
bottles or Amazon yeah there's been some
pretty brutal news out of Amazon yeah
and everyone knows Amazon sucks in that
way or has and yeah that they dodged
paying taxes and that they kind of
strong-armed the cities that they
operate in to give them a favorable like
subsidies and tax exemptions and stuff
like that so they're really focused on
having a on benefiting the customer
they're obsessed with the customer at
the expense of other things like
employee happiness yes but this is about
Whole Foods and Whole Foods has its own
CEO and you know I guess I'll sensibly
like its own practices and stuff I don't
know how entangled those two companies
are but that's just one thing I want to
keep in mind obviously it would it would
definitely be the case that Amazon just
like other big retailers like Walmart
whoever Target who have been screwed as
for this in the past it would be really
bad if they had their workers unionized
I don't think it would be that bad for
Whole Foods it'd be worse Ramazan if
they got you their workers got you yeah
I think a lot would have to change I I
have only ever personally been in one
union I thought you're gonna say in one
whole
I think that might also be true there's
a like nature's Fair near here which is
essentially the same thing I've been in
there budget times that's like local all
right yeah how did you like working in a
union no I freaking hated it but I may
have that my problem is that I've only
worked in one mm-hmm and my case was
relatively unique I guess where I worked
at a bread factory I worked at Canada
bread factory you're a wholesome guy
very holy oh yeah we made some of that
by the way basically all the bread and
somewhere like Walmart all comes from
the same spot and is made the same way
and just gets put in different bags it's
great anyways I used to work there we
were all in a union it was a multi
whatever union where like it oversaw a
bunch of different types of workers yeah
like where we live there's the BCG you
it's the biggest union and then that
covers like everyone from prison guards
to firefighters yeah yeah yeah this this
wasn't that one but it was a different
form of a similar thing where it's a
bunch of different disciplines and our
union guy I guess the steward from
reading this for our factory was a
expletive I hated that dude you hated
him with everything of God I had to pay
union dues when all I'm trying to do is
make money to go to school and this guy
was just a big jerk and none of the
people I didn't know a single person
that worked there that liked him and
there was nothing we could really do
about it the people above him in the
Union that we tried to contact wouldn't
get rid of him so we had like the same
problem that you would have with like
some jerk boss just within the Union and
I had to pay him to be a jerk to me this
freakin sauce the union's ever go away
like once they know I don't know I don't
know enough about it I don't really
personally want to comment too much on
this because I really don't know enough
but I just had one singular bad
experience and I haven't been in a union
outside of that so I really don't know I
do know from like history that there's
been multiple times where unions were
absolutely necessary completely to solve
a compliant major problem but
do they ever go away after that that's
the that's the thing I don't I don't
know I know quite a few people that
don't like them I know quite a few
people that do like them I know my
experience sucked yeah I worked for a
union and it was sweet for me because I
made more money than I should have and
no that was great
cool I have a friend who's in a union
again he actually is a corrections
correctional officer okay prison guard
and it sucks for him because the pay
raises are completely just like
regimented it's not like you kicked a
lot of but this year and you're gonna
get a sweet pay raise it's like well
you've worked here this long and we're
renegotiating the union agreement this
year and we're all gonna get a 6% raise
and that raised by the way that we're
fighting for isn't for your particular
job it's for like what you said a
cross-section of different industries
and everyone who fits in this buckets
getting the same raise even though
you've got to deal with people stabbing
each other and stuff I like my one of my
problems was where where I worked we
knew when you got hired they had to do a
super basic math test and the super
basic math test was good there's 24
slices in a low blow but basically
they're trying to see like how how smart
are you because there's like there's a
position called bun Packer that was
great where you you pick up stuff off a
conveyor line you grab it you turn to
the right you put it down you rotate
back grab it you turn to the right and
you put it your body get all dolled up
that's the whole job for eight hours a
day oh so like that job can be done by
anyone but then there's like the mixer
who has to like put any ingredients and
that's a little bit more specific and
there's a people who like pack the
trucks and you have to put the right
amount of carts of the right amount of
stuff on the right trucks and there's
like slightly more advanced jobs so so
you're a bun packer
well everyone starts there regardless of
how well you do
did you ever leave that bun back I did
yeah I got moved up really fast and the
Union head didn't like that because the
the non-union guys got to pick where you
worked but the Union guys picked your
hours so because I went up in position
really quickly the Union had just
screwed me not in terms of he gave me
really low hours but he would just wreck
mmm like he'd shift me at like the worst
possible times and he'd always have me
as like the emergency call guy he'd be
he'd be like be there in 15 minutes
and he'd call me as I was trying to go
to bed because it was purely on call and
I was just like oh and you made my life
hell for an entire summer so I don't I
don't like that hole and then they have
all those things like like a promotions
based on seniority and so yeah like all
these in your twenty years because you
saw there's nothing else he has no other
prospects everyone else good left so
yeah I don't know I think there are
situations where it can be bad I think
there's situations where it can be good
and I have no idea for Whole Foods okay
well here's my one last this is my
tinfoil hat hot - yeah can you get the
screen shot up from that article yes so
if you open up the Gizmodo article
they've got some embedded screen caps
from this alleged video just go to the
first one just just go through it we're
gonna go on a journey here actually
that's the screenshot that I want I'm
just gonna go here so everybody's we'll
give them living wage grievance contract
representation is that what that last
word is I want to go to the tips one
tips yeah there's this this one okay
tips remember remember managers tips if
you see someone trying to organize just
remember T IPS threatened interrogate
promise and spy I have a hard time
believing that any company that sounds
so fake that is so egregious and
outrageous that if that's true that's
crazy but there's it's just so
outrageous that that can't be true and
then I see that I'm just like is this
whole thing fake does this video even
exist because that is just over the top
threaten and interrogate come on as if
promise promise what so like and are
they telling you to lie cuz what is yeah
I promise I guess that's what that means
but promise is the nicest word in there
but can you imagine telling like like
all this executive executives are
telling the management like sitting down
the team leaders at home
foods which is like threatened and
interrogate your employees yeah exactly
there's no way they said that doesn't
sound real come on so I think it's fake
news I wonder if they got sourced
something that seemed super legit and
they just believed it it could be men
the Russians that throws me off a lot to
be honest because that sounds really
really you know this interrogate thing
made me think of one of one of my
employees how's it going AJ he was
mentioning in French the question mark
it translates to interrogation mark Oh
interesting
well there's a smile he'll say
interrogation mark when you say about
question mark I'm like that's so intense
there's an obscure form of punctuation
that is a mix but you know how when you
wanted to ask a question intensely and
you use a question mark and that
summation point yeah well there's a one
unified really like notation it's called
an interrobang I have heard that phrase
but I didn't know that yes there's
actually a really good episode of 99%
invisible about it
Tarot bang there's like it's 99%
invisible it's is awesome like design
focused podcast yeah you you should show
everyone looks pretty cool
it does look cool I'll bring it up
there's this dude who like championed it
and like tried to make it happen really
hard wait so it's is it a thing or no
like is it officially recognized
notation interrobang I guess it's well
it's on the keyboard it ain't real
and it looks like a really powerful P it
could be an alt code thing though
interrobang alt code it has a Unicode
yeah boyee and tur begging is not a
standard punctuation work Wow a few
modern typefaces or fonts include a
glyph for the interrobang character to
standard interrobang is at unicode code
point you plus two o3d blockers
what is that is that Pink Panther
that's oh Sam's jerky
hey oh yeah gave us some oho jalapeno
hot sauce can I hold something for now
cuz that's almost certainly gonna come
home with me and never come back you say
Moho
mojo no it's not mojo jalapa no i said
mojo forever and then we got very much
corrected but it switched at and they're
apparently correct I looked it up
what does the Moho mean Spanish I don't
know I'm gonna look that up I know what
slow ho means what's he mean I mean that
temptress twirled Moho Spanish
pronunciation mo X oh well I'm not going
to try that yeah yeah just means some
type of sauce okay we have ghost pepper
buffalo sauce and sriracha bacon and
original jerky here and he's got Momo
jalapeno which is so far my favorite
jerky from savage jerky in sauce form so
I'm super excited to try that at home
because I'm definitely gonna steal it
it's not coming back unless someone
tells me to bring it back in which case
it will immediately come back their
jerky is made with the best ingredients
without nitrates or preservatives with
the goal to create a snack that is full
of flavor and spice and isn't bad for
you all at the same time they have 13
different flavors which goes on top of
the ones that we have here I left this
world for a second there they also
include things like sriracha bacon which
I have here and maple buffalo bacon and
many others they also make barbecue
sauce hot sauce and spice rub like the
hot sauce Moho jalapeno that we have
here their Carolina Reaper hot sauce
uses one of the hottest peppers in the
world which is pretty crazy we don't
have I've tried the jerky and it's
pretty brutal it's an experience I think
I did the last show that lioness was on
I ate one just nonchalant without
telling him and he didn't notice so I
was pretty proud of that because usually
I like sort of die
when I when I eat it I remember it's on
it was the first Blanche I was ever on I
tried it and I tried to play real cool
and you're sitting there and suddenly
like your pupils fill up with blood
coming out of my ears one thing from
coming from someone who enjoys spice I
like spice but to a limit like once it
gets to his pet once it gets past my
limit it becomes not fun that's everyone
in the world dude
no they just enjoy the paint oh there's
absolutely people have enjoyed this many
masochists I think my dad is one of
those people because my dad will eat any
hot sauce ever he will like taunt people
at restaurants where like you know
there's like like Indian heat you order
something spicy as it why people spicy
yeah yeah you're like very hot they'll
be like all right I'll give you a medium
he'll like taunt them yeah so that
they'll like intentionally spike it even
harder and he just loves it but then if
they come out and he's sweating and he's
like dabbing and he's like huh then they
win but he also wins like he wants that
my dad's crazy you also like what got
his a break he'll also just pop
jalapenos and not react at all because
he's just a machine
but anyways his mouth is just dead he
has calluses for everything else I've
lost all sensitivity enough it makes me
cool that's like everything that's an
acquired taste it's bad coffee cigars
olives whiskey Olaf's is an acquired
taste it was for me okay a lot of people
don't like olives I like him now and I
get him and nobody eats him I got
parties and stuff i we're getting off
switch off this for a second I love
olives and to like a point where it's a
character fault
almost when I was a kid my mom used to
buy canned olives and like the neighbors
and my brother and I would like the
neighbors kids and my brother and I
we're all sit down and like play a board
game or something and I just grabbed a
can of Olives just eat the entire thing
then when I was done I would shrink oh
and it drove people insane but I didn't
do it for that reason actually just
really liked it but
anyways wait I have an olive story okay
I had a party once we're all eating
olives and and then this one friend of
mine was like we're just commenting on
olives and blah blah blah and it was at
the stage where I was just getting into
them and wasn't sure if I liked him or
not yet and my friend was like this
sounds so hardcore
he was like yeah and he was like I think
eating all this is like kind of erotic
and then silent it was like okay like
I'm not holding it against him like no I
mean Navy is whatever I just hadn't had
that thought and it was it's a very non
offensive thing to be into in that way
but like geez anyways moving on okay I
mean if you want to like sell olives or
anything else like services or anything
for that matter
you could use fresh books it is a super
simple to use invoicing tool that
actually there's a lot more than help
you create and send slick-looking
invoices which is a great feature on its
own it helps you track your time with
their timesheet function manage your
expenses and it keeps track of who owes
you what also has a feature that tells
you when your clients look at your
invoice for the first time which is a
big deal and their mobile app has all
the functionality of their desktop
version which is cool so you can take
fresh books wherever you go and not lose
any features which is super annoying if
you have any questions feel free to
reach out to their support staff where
you'll speak to a real human being
no phone tree no escalations no return
calls just just straight-up answers
because it fresh book Stockholm slash
win and enter win and the how did you
hear about a section when you sign up
for a free trial very cool at least
honey
mmm honey honey you reminds her spa I
don't know the next line and you got me
wanting you I do I use honey all the
time actually personally that isn't even
like I don't have to say that I just do
it's pretty sweet the ingredient or the
sponsor the sponsor the only time I ever
use honey the ingredient is in like
chamomile or ginger tea because I'm sick
but anyways moving forward
you've probably heard
talk about honey before cuz we they've
they've been a sponsor of the show
before but if you have it it's a free
shopping tool that finds the best promo
codes whenever you shop online at
specific sites so like when you go to a
site and you're in the checkout section
when it finally shows the box to type in
a promo code honey will be like hey I
think I might have a few codes for this
every time you read out this spot I'm
like why don't I have this you should
probably try it it's so stupid and you
just press the button and it goes
through an automated thing trying a
bunch of codes and sometimes it'll be
like hey none of them worked sorry and
sometimes you'll you'll get a pretty
sweet code I I've saved a very notable
amount of money I don't know exactly
what it is but it's like I've saved a
decent amount of money using honey
that's sweet like if you think about it
if you've ever gone shopping for
something and you get to the checkout
section and you see a promo code box and
you spend like five minutes on Google
going to a bunch of sketchy websites
I've done that trying to get promo codes
I've done that and then I typed them in
and then they'd never ever expires with
honey
it actually works quite often yeah you
don't have to do any of the sketchy
stuff it just goes all there for you and
you don't have to copy and paste a
million codes it just chugs through them
as fast as it can way better and it's
gonna know when the codes fail for you
and update its central stuff try to
always have up-to-date codes as everyone
attempts differently the service cost
tons of money though Luke it's free for
those of you that like try it out it's a
free browser extension available on
Chrome Firefox and Safari save you time
saves you money when you shop it over
30,000 stores
honey works on Amazon eBay new egg
raiser Best Buy Walmart and more
including skip the dishes I've had it
worked there quite a few times honey
gets a small amount of commission from
sites where honey saves you money
there's also quite often
honey specific discount codes oh yeah no
that's how that will work nice and
they'll get like a affiliate style
partnerships there so they make money
off of the places that you buy stuff
from not off of you
which is cool get that honey money and I
understand why they explain that because
I think that helps with some of the
skepticism because it sounds too good to
be true and then you're like oh
okay they're just making money like
travel a different source yeah yeah
that's a pretty good it installs in just
two clicks which is sweet
it says Colton Brandon and a few others
here at LMG have used honey to save
money shopping online and yeah do what
Corey does go to honey calm slash Linus
and you got it done here's a fun thing I
did today yeah this one um so there's a
new Facebook vulnerability that Facebook
announced Facebook engineers have
discovered a security issue affecting
almost 50 million accounts attackers
exploit a vulnerability in Facebook's
code that impacted a feature called view
as and that's one of those features
where you look at your page as other
people see it so like LinkedIn has that
kind of thing it's actually a super cool
feature because it lets you see sorry I
thought I saw someone in chat but it's
someone with like a parody name of them
it lets you see your page as that person
so if you're trying to hide things from
people you can pick someone who fits
within a category yeah of your privacy
settings check it out make sure it's all
hidden properly yeah so there was a
problem though because so what happened
was it's like an interaction between
multiple different features in the
Facebook code so it stemmed from a
change of Facebook made to their video
uploading hello yeah which affected view
ass and that changed the video uploading
flow was in July 2017 that's a pretty
long time ago that sucks so Facebook
issued this like this post that they had
fixed availability and informed law
enforcement including the FBI and they
said all these things that they like
here's what we did because we care about
your security so much they reset the
access tokens of the 50 million counts
affected the acts of access tokens are
like those they're like digital keys
that allow you to not have to type in
your name and password every time your
browser or now to get around and so this
this exploit that got the keys so people
could screw you and so
Facebook they reset the access tokens to
like 50 million accounts that were
affected and then they took the
precautionary step of resetting access
tokens for yet another 40 million that
we thought like they could they had been
subject to a view as the past year yeah
I so I have heard from a person I
haven't talked to many people about this
yet but in the small group of people
that I have talked to I have heard from
a person that they had to relog into
Facebook on all of their devices well
here's the fun this later yes this is
the fun thing I did today because when
you here's what I did I went to my phone
and I went Facebook and I got this and
Facebook messenger as well session
expired please log in again which means
I either was compromised I'm either one
of the 50 million on one of the forty
million yeah and I don't know which one
and then it says that once you log in
again you will see on your newsfeed a
notification at the top that explains
what happened damn it yeah I didn't get
on anything
Dameon Instagram as well though Facebook
has yet to determine whether these
accounts were misused or whether any
information was accessed they don't know
who is behind the attacks they don't
know from which geographic region the
attacker is hail I mean you can probably
guarantee that in some way it was
misused like they're gonna try to
harvest some form of information I don't
know what it's gonna buddy what if they
just made funny posts like they just
made Luke Luke status oh well I talked
to this goes count there's Luke status
don't you hate when your finger punches
through the toilet paper
everybody Luke TMI why would you post
that I did it and I have that like
extension on my computer so I can't see
my newsfeed with that oh no but I like
the idea no it's great and it puts like
an inspirational quote where the
newsfeed is or where the I don't know
what is even called the feed in general
that is only news because it's your
friends post and stuff but yeah I only
I exclusively use Facebook for chats and
groups yeah that's awesome so i just
banned the feed so i wouldn't even know
if I have that on mobile no but I just
don't go to the Facebook app on mobile I
just only use messenger yeah they'll be
awesome they should get it for Instagram
but then that would get rid of the
entire app god is great
I guess you could see like stories and
PMS instead of a inspirational quote
they should give you an I list mean just
a direct feed from the Nilus Arby's
Twitter it just be inevitable end of the
universe it's heat death nothing bad
it's nothing nothing that you do matters
because it will be deleted by the Sun
anyway so that's that's scary if you got
logged out of all your stuff joseph'
heads-up so you may had access to your
account Nathan pwned like me yeah on
Facebook by the way says you don't need
to update your password as it was access
token based not yesterday's so they
didn't have to do anything
they didn't Forge the key to the lock
they just walked around the door that's
how I described that security style cool
because some people talk about like oh
like I have a password that's a hundred
characters this account is invulnerable
to everything no because if they find a
way to just not have to use the password
or if you give it to them or that yeah
did you follow the the Disney Fox
comcast thing like pretty much not at
all we've talked about it a little bit
let me give you a 10-second err sure
okay like it's it's been evolving over
the summer there's these really big
players that are all trying to trying to
acquire each other because there's a
giant race for streaming platform and
where you're gonna watch your TV next so
let me give you the TLDR fun Zeke d-did
a super chat sorry I'm new to this stuff
I don't know the YouTube streaming stuff
he said you guys are awesome oh that's
us that's us yeah yeah did thanks man
yeah nice also rip headphone users
floatplane for the win
I appreciate it man thank you very much
appreciate you yeah by the way Zeke
floatplane has a new payment system
which is cool and there's now a big line
though nobody know Bitcoin no Bitcoin
and there's now discord integrations
from floatplane calm to discord what
does that mean
you can have your account sync up so
this is it's a general thing any of the
creators can do it
I haven't told tech deals or bit wit yet
the browser we're still testing things a
little bit and making sure that a little
bit more cleaned up but theoretically
they could turn it on any time but
there's there's still some work to do
before it's perfect and it makes it so
that if you join that creators discord
you get a special role saying you're
like a subscriber to full plane oh yeah
and you can get granted access to a chat
I don't know how the creators want to
decide is it they get to implement the
perks as they want yeah so much freedom
the land of the free is flow plan
seriously it also has a notification
feature so it can like post links to new
videos as they come up into the discord
and whatnot that's cool
yeah just hanging on discord anyway yeah
anyway here's the timeline from the
whole like thanks auction drama there's
a ton of auctions to buy stuff it's
actually kind of interesting okay Fox
furs for sale like 20th Century Fox
alright is that different in Fox I have
think that's a subset of Fox I'm gonna
cut you off for one quick second we got
another crazy super chat no idea what
this is worth but it's 1,024 SEC is that
that's not Singapore is it what is SEC
currency you said all of review channel
and floatplane
heck yeah dude oh it's Swedish Krona
nice nice how much was it 1,024 from
that's 150 bucks Rules Canadian holy
geez yeah okay sorry let's let's get
back to the Fox which for sale Disney
wanted to buy it
Disney's making a streaming service and
plus they also own a large part of Hulu
so buying Fox gives you a lot of sweet
shows over the years like Family Guy and
all sorts yeah that they could put on
the streaming services so Fox wanted to
verify so there you go Disney wanted to
buy Fox Comcast was competing with him
to buy Fox and they had like a bid
more and in the end Disney one and they
acquired Fox but meanwhile Fox owned 39%
of this european network called sky and
all of us lee both of these companies
Comcast and Disney even want to be in
Europe because they want expand globally
so while Fox was for sale and being bid
on by Disney and Comcast Fox itself
which is owned by Rupert Murdoch was
trying to get 100 percent stake in sky
or at least a majority stake in sky her
weight was no no Fox own sky her own 39
percent of sky and yeah and Fox was
trying to own it wholly so that when
when it was when Fox was bought whoever
bought it would also get all sky so in
the end between Disney and Comcast
Disney won they spent more than they
wanted to and they they got Fox but they
didn't end up getting sky because when
Comcast did not win the bid to get what
let go when Comcast did not win the bid
to get Fox
they started bidding on sky and they
actually outbid Fox on bidding on sky
this make sense okay yeah so now
so then Comcast owns part of sky and
Disney because they bought Fox they
owned part of sky and in the end Fox was
just every way no Disney didn't get it
wasn't it ended up not being part of the
deal and then Fox just like screw it
comcast you can have all the sky so now
the at the end Disney on Fox Comcast on
sky there's no more partial ownership
okay
there you have it that was a mess not
your explanation just everything that
happened there was crazy it's it's
pretty amount of back-and-forth little
dance there I'm surprised they surprised
Disney gave up on that because they've
been just chomping things lately
surprised they were just like no we're
taking that 39% I don't I don't know how
that works I don't cuz the Disney deal I
thought was just going through so much
earlier that I don't know if this had an
affair
but that they ended up changing the
price that they pay for fox because they
thought that sky was gonna be part of
the fox deal crazy hold on what's the
sale price here okay hold on you guys
need to recheck the caption on the
amazon Gizmodo article you got the tips
picture wrong people are flipping out oh
really
let's look into this thanks for the tip
oh don't want to report the wrong thing
no Bob swine Bob pond that's okay we're
navigating back now we got to go to the
original source though yeah
gizmo dude what does the he says the
caption that's right under it tips are
the tactics Amazon advises pretty big
important difference
so mm okay okay well now I'm just gonna
shift blame to Gizmodo well okay because
that that screenshot is really
incriminating and de flam Ettore but
they don't actually I don't believe they
address it in their article except for
this little caption so I think that's a
little misleading but yeah let's own up
we didn't read the caption yeah
obviously they don't they don't want
people interrogating spying how's it
going dude it's hard but sometimes we
did two super chats cool cool ins
yelling at us are we supposed to do you
how many crona's we're getting we're
rolling Cronus over a thousand whoa yeah
Swedish Cronus look that up cool yeah I
don't see any like main oh my god I like
the look are we still streaming did
someone turn oh God remotely through the
app please that that the the squid the
squid dead
so that means the cameras off oh my god
okay whoa
anarchy are we streaming we are we are
streaming and the cameras on you can see
that you wouldn't be able to seize it oh
oh I like that interesting we got a
little bit alike I like this low-key
look Thank You Zach F for the heads up
I don't personally I don't want to yeah
I don't personally see them really talk
about this tips thing in any of their
mainline stuff but we absolutely should
have read the caption Oh makes a lot
more sense
don't threaten interrogate or promise or
spy on your employees that makes sense
because they were we did talk about how
they were talking about things not to do
got a phone call from the dentist here
nice just gonna let that one ring out
don't have a voicemail anymore
that's a little update I don't know if I
ever talked about that Owen Shaw but I
talked to Linus about it because he was
saying you know how you get these
notifications for voicemail and they
just don't go away you can't clear those
I hate that I absolutely hate it and
then you go to check your voicemail and
if you're someone like me who doesn't
pay an MSP until like cuz it just comes
off your tax return anyway so there's no
reason and anyway I always have a full
voice mail and then celina said that he
had a colleague in the past I think at
NCI X who said his voicemail was
literally hi this is the voicemail of
blah blah blah do not leave a message
here email me or send me a text do not
leave a message here and I thought that
sounds like an okay thing to do but my
voicemail is always full of scams and of
MSP who's gonna leave a message anyway
so that was gonna work so I just got it
completely removed my life is better all
right there you go I I just do direct
withdrawal on MSP yeah cuz I don't want
to think about it
ya ever do that before I think whatever
I like your style too though I think one
of those two are probably the way to go
evade
yeah pay it or a Dodger no you're still
paying it as a paid yeah
yeah you still paying you have to
anyways yeah so sorry about that
inaccuracy thank you for checking us on
that thank you very much but I'm happy
that's I'm happy that's fixed now
was there more super chefs there it'd
probably are we like how much yeah I
guess we've been going for almost our
allotted time I don't know how to check
the super chats though can you talk to
me about this PlayStation cross-platform
playing fortnight's the first game you
can play a cross-platform from your
Playstation yeah so here you talk about
that I mean try to forget super chats
okay well I'll give the notes but I
actually want to hear your like your
take on I will comment on it well so
finally so any interactive entertainment
says it has identified a path towards
supporting cross-platform features for
third party content so the first step is
going to be an open beta which is on now
for the game fortnight of course that
will allow cross-platform gameplay
progression and commerce across the
PlayStation for Android iOS and in ten
dos which Xbox one Microsoft Windows and
Mac operating systems ah I think I think
this is weird like are you just gonna be
a poem by people with keyboard and mouse
uh I think to the certain to a certain
degree I think people almost don't care
but in this gain a battle royale where
like if you're the third one left alive
and then you get rekt and you're you
just came back by you're gonna rage
quitting your guy definitely as a
keyboard mouse yeah what if there's a
way to q cross platform and a way to
queue not cross by forum if that makes
sense yeah I I wonder that as well but I
my name information on that cuz I would
still like to be a little ability to
play with my buddy so like if my buddy
has a ps4 and I for some reason wanted
to play fortnight I'd like to play with
him I think it would probably make sense
if we had to queue for the PC q yeah I
think it would be segregated because
you'd have to bring up the
I don't know how to say this you're not
as tactile experiences yeah like if you
wanted to Gotham yeah well not you'd
actually have to hurt them or nerf the
other one yeah because you wouldn't it
would be it would be kind of brutal I
think to bring a PC player into a
console only environment yeah by
inviting him to your group but if you're
gonna have to go the other way oh yeah
it would have to bring up someone it's
like it's your decision to queue with a
PC player so you have to go play yeah
you see people you know what I mean if
you want to play mobile fortnight I
don't know if this is a thing probably
it is if you want to play well no but if
you wanna play mobile fortnight with a
PC player yeah I'm just gonna get so
wrapped so and the thing that's
interesting is that the game developers
are pushing it for this role sorry I
have no idea what like the fortnight
cross-platform queuing stuff is I'm just
saying that would make more sense to me
gaming developers not just a fortnight
but of other games I have one o'clock
cross-platform for a long time because
they just want more and more people to
play our game but obviously the console
makers like Microsoft and Sony they have
the opposite incentive they want people
to be silo siloed so I wonder if you're
playing and you're getting rekt by
something with the keyboard and mouse
and you really care about the game at
you're thinking well I got a switch to
PC cuz I want to kick ass with a
keyboard and mouse do you think there's
a 49 will already queue keyboard and
mouse apart from controller unless your
group of friends so their dream is so
you can be on your PC on a controller
well yeah but the game recognizes that
and that's how they that would make
sense I think because there's no real
advantage there yeah a little bit of
framerate or like hurts like refresh
rate yes sir
but yeah okay that's cool but do you
hear I'm saying like if I'm playing and
then someone reacts me to the mouse and
I'm like why am i playing on console I'm
just gonna move to PC and then I'm no
longer a Sony PlayStation customer I
don't think that's really gonna happen
because if they're already splitting the
queues for controllers and keep my mouth
unless you're in a group then the only
reason why you're bringing being brought
to play with other people with keyboard
a mouse is because you're playing with
one ear
yeah and the amount of people that are
gonna be in that niche group and then
also care enough to buy a whole nother
platform yeah it should be really small
you've also already got the sunk cost of
you bought your places already so maybe
on the next-gen you don't buy the
next-gen you lied PC and said maybe
and I think PlayStation is making so
many people happy with this change and
is honestly they might open the door for
a lot more people to buy Playstations
because if if one if someone's like yeah
I only play on freakin PC because my
friends play on PC and I want to play a
bunch of the really good single-player
experiences on PlayStation like God of
War horizon zero dawn spider-man all
these really good single-player
experiences they could buy a Playstation
and still play with their friends it'll
be an optimal experience or you're
playing on mobile and you want to get
more into it but you can't afford a
gaming PC get a console yeah still play
through mobile I think it's a very good
move for PlayStation we don't know right
now what the future holds for other
games other than fortnight getting this
they haven't announced that at all so
people are also bringing up that you can
keep wearing us on on PlayStation yeah
to go through some super chats someone
asked is LTE I'm not going to go through
all of them by the way but I'll do but
we will thank and acknowledge all of you
thank you yes thank you very much you're
super I'll go through some notable
questions that I can actually answer is
LTI it's going to be around mid July
next year I don't know exactly I don't
want to say a definitive thing but I
suspect roughly yeah I suspect would be
somewhere around that area
I don't know that should be mid July but
like yeah some if you're booking off
time yeah if you're booking on time
don't we don't even know which country
it's gonna be in right now yeah to be
honest no but like it'll probably be the
summer ish awesome thank you very much
Pat myself on the back for that all of
her view all overview heck yeah alright
almost my dudes I'll be doing that it'll
be well put it on Steam
we'll make an uncensored erotic story
game about olives so I said Luke any
plans for mobile apps for floatplane
absolutely there's there's some other
stuff for us to tackle first but yes I
think that's about it ah we're gonna end
the show there thank you very much for
showing up we'll see you next week on
the LAN show and that's it
