materials of every drone or quadcopter
being flown above the mountaintops or in
the remote wilderness but what you can't
see unless you look really closely is
the gigantic Pelican that was used to
carry it there and don't get me started
on the whole enjoy the thrill of flight
as you soar through the air they always
leave off the bit about on a tiny little
screen with so much glare you can't see
jack well all of that ends today
DJI sent us one of the first early units
of their first person view flight
goggles and a Mavic Pro the fully
featured drone that's small enough to
put in your pants if you're into that
sort of thing
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops featured Intel 7th
generation Core i7 processors check them
out at the link below
I haven't actually reviewed the DJI
Mavic pro yet so before we get into the
experience of using the brand new DJI
goggles I feel like it deserves some
attention when it comes to features
there's nothing especially
groundbreaking about it on paper it
could almost be summarized as a
miniature phantom for the arms for the
front motors fold out from the side the
arms for the rear motors fold down from
the bottom and like a Falken you'll need
to remove the hood before you fly and
that's pretty much it you're ready to go
even the quick-release rotors can be
left in place during transport and will
unfold themselves once you start the
drone
it comes with a surprisingly economic
and compact controller that can be used
independently or with a real-time feed
from the camera that's much lower
latency than before thanks to occu sync
by plugging in your phone with the
included cables it's got microSD
expansion with the ability to save a
backup copy of the streamed video to
your device
it's got ultrasonic sensors and dual
downward facing cameras front-facing
cameras for collision detection that
works great as long as the thing in
front of you isn't glass the onboard GPS
enables a handful of different
autonomous modes but there are still
some issues from my perspective
neither the mode that attempts to
recognize you based on a short setup
process nor the one that tracks your
location based on following the GPS
signal from the controller is capable of
changing height relative to you so if
you go up a mountain or down it it will
run out of ground or lose sight of you
point of interest though is solid for
getting smooth footage in a circle
around an object but manual control is
pretty much where it's at
from my perspective the Mavic smaller
size ends up being both a pro and a con
its agility not to mention the much high
quality of its metal and plastic
construction our strong points that
enable it to go into areas that might
concern owners of larger more fragile
drones but even in the much higher
performance sport mode that can go up to
65 kilometers an hour it's not the
fastest out there and it's a touch more
susceptible to gusts the with that said
in normal conditions once again I've got
to hand it to the engineers at DJI
you've got to speed up the footage to
make it feel like anything but a tripod
in the sky the 4k camera can be
evaluated two ways from a professional
standpoint I could discuss how the one
in 2/3 inch sensor doesn't handle
low-light as well as the higher-end
phantom 4 pro or how the recording
compression makes 4k off the Mavic look
more like 1080 off of a good camcorder
but from a consumer or even prosumer
standpoint all of that really goes out
the window if you're just looking for
dope AF aerial footage of whatever cool
thing you're doing you're going to
absolutely love this thing but will you
love it from a first-person perspective
the DJI goggles as they're calling them
put you right in the cockpit of your
drone after a very short setup process
using the onboard touch pad or the
controller once you've paired it to
register your fpv headset you just lower
the blast shield and you're dropped into
what is effectively a gigantic movie
theater full of where you're flying and
impressively thanks to DJ eyes use of
dual full HD displays their goggles have
got to be the best-looking virtual
theater I've seen yet with almost no
discernible screen door effect where you
can see gaps between the pixels so I
spent most of my time in the mode that
moves the camera gimbal according to
your head position and the new
fixed-wing mode that kind of flies where
you look like a like a head steered
airplane would and if you're an aerial
sights here who has never done fpv
before like me you're going to be
absolutely blown away the latency on the
connection
while not low enough to keep me from
getting a little nauseated if I stood up
or tried to move around while I'm flying
made the controls super intuitive to use
and the video quality whether you choose
720p at 60 FPS or 1080p at 30fps was
sharp enough that I never once found
myself thinking you know this is okay
but it would be so much better if I
popped the microSD out of the drone and
then into the goggles after the fact to
watch the full quality clip and I guess
yeah that's kind of a cool thing too you
can watch movies in your private theater
using the onboard speakers or headphone
jack if you want to but now we have to
talk drawbacks
thanks to their omnidirectional antenna
array in the headband their battery
their dual displays etc DJ eyes goggles
are heavier and less comfortable than I
wish that they were and there's also
significant light bleed around the nose
I'd prefer something that has more of a
strap like system to hold it against my
face but that's honestly far from the
biggest thing preventing me from
recommending that you run out and buy a
pair right now for four hundred and
fifty bucks
you may have noticed that in all of my
footage using the Mavic Pro and the
goggles I've got somebody with me well
this is mandated by law in the US
because you're legally required in most
areas that I'm aware of any way to
maintain line-of-sight with your
aircraft something that's obviously not
possible inside an enclosed helmet so
the DJI goggles like many things in life
I guess are best enjoyed with a friend
to keep an eye on your drone for you but
that's tough for people like me who
frankly just don't have any friends
further complicating matters for
recreational drone users Canada's latest
batch of restrictions makes the
operation of a UAV like this one illegal
basically anywhere but the wilderness
which is why some of our footage which
was taken before these regulations were
added to the Criminal Code
near our office and some of it was taken
in the middle of corn beam nowhere after
the rule change I mean some of what
they're doing does make sense to help
keep people safe but a lot of it frankly
feels over restrictive so I guess if
you've made it this far in the video
thinking wow this thing looks awesome
that thing looks awesome but I don't
even think I'd be able to use it in my
area then I guess what I have to say is
get some discussion going in the
comments and reach out to your local
representation because experiences this
cool shouldn't just be for people who
have a you know a getaway cabin in the
woods somewhere
