in as little space as possible it'll be
a gaming rig sir and graphics card at
CPU rate we've got an X 99 motherboard
that's
ITX that's how this whole thing happened
now I remember why we're doing this
the coarser HX 1200 I power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power and corsair link
digital for advanced monitoring and
control click to learn more so I guess
let's do a quick run through the parts
we've got the highlight of the show is
definitely the ass rock x99 e ITX AC
this is a surprisingly I guess I might
as well just open it it's not like we're
not going to do this this is a
surprisingly fully-featured x99
motherboard considering that it's an ITX
board the socket actually takes up a
significant portion of the total area of
the board like check this out guys the
x99 LGA 2011 3 socket is massive now one
thing you might notice about it is that
the socket actually has non-standard
mounting holes so we are going to be a
little bit limited in terms of what
cooler we can use although thankfully
asrock does include a cooler in the box
so hopefully that will fit in our case
so we're going to be using a silverstone
Sugo SG 13 this is a new case we're
actually going to have a review coming
probably based on our impressions from
this bill long it's small yeah
a fir Ram we're gonna be using not an
entire quad channel kit of ddr4 because
the ask for rock board only supports two
memory slots so we're gonna be running a
dual channel which means we're going to
be limited in terms of both capacity and
bandwidth however if you checked out our
memory video which you can click on
Luke's face or behind the whatever the
picture over Luke's face now to learn
about we determined going from dual
channel to quad channel and ddr4 on even
an extreme edition processor doesn't
make a difference these days finally
we've got an ax 760i power supply which
I have no idea if we're actually going
to be able to use because we haven't
vetted the compatibility of this build
at all yet we'll try it but this power
supply would work with cable mod cables
which look freakin awesome which is why
we chose it so so we're going to try and
hopefully it works so who actually
really knows for a processor we have a
59 60 X because it's just kind of
badass and we're trying to build a small
badass rig so it just kind of works we
have an Intel 730 series processor we
can't use their 750 series because yeah
we actually don't know if it supports
nvme but I'm gonna go with no I don't
think so
and then we have a Titan X because it's
the fastest single GPU card at least for
now we'll see when that new AMD stuff
comes out but at least Ram it in there
yeah yeah like in the the box it looks
small and then you take it out and it
looks even way smaller
it's a Titan ax even gonna fit and I was
wondering about that
it's seems you're gonna do from the
outset of what you know what won't make
it work I mean we could probably eyeball
OD needy it depends how they've laid out
the inside guts here oh this thing is
pretty bare yep well there's not a whole
lot of room for anything but the parts I
guess so there's that the way the Wi-Fi
card installs in this thing is janky as
all balls you just slide it into this
slot hmm
little things no can we cut it wait yeah
yeah look look there's a gap
Brendan look look at the gap look at the
gap yeah yeah I think it can get in
there but that is some tight business oh
yeah that's in it works alright we're
gonna put a tight necks in here we are I
have a surprise oh the 59 60 X was a
throwaway or a red herring or a Trojan
horse or whatever it was a trick in my
pocket oh I have something else entirely
which will make this the most powerful
mini ITX gaming rig ever this is a 2699
v3 18 core 36 thread processor it turbos
up to 3.6 gigahertz so you're still
going to get that gaming performance
when you need single threaded
performance and it is able to run 18
core sustain that's something in the
but I think it was 2.6 gigahertz or so
so it absolutely cleans the clock of the
59 60 X both in terms of performance and
in terms of actual physical size you
wouldn't even look at them and think
that they fit in the same socket would
you look at that it actually overhangs
the edge of the socket with extra heat
spreader area because they got to put
all those cores somewhere oh yeah does
this look like it fits an H ATI it says
specifically in the Box specific cooler
types check this out
it looks like asrock thought of this so
this plate does specifically fit on this
is this is an H 100 I because I don't
think we're going to get an H a DI in
here either way we're not using a stock
thing at this point anymore well you
know we can try the nvme set up okay
this is ready but I'm not actually gonna
install it yet just so it isn't in the
way I wanted to see if we could fit this
thing in super Genki and like some crazy
angle or something oh not going to work
yeah I do you want to figure out the
power supply's gonna fit I think it will
um will it fit with a thick rad cuz if I
could just use an H ATI then that would
make my life a little bit easier sure
culture
there's a white 860 I in the in the
sub-zero build the build where the
storage CPU and power supply all changed
within like 20 minutes cooling don't
forget cooling also cooling hey we're
good on the power supply okay found it
in your office
cool and I found an H Adi
must be 3.1 then that's crazy I don't
think this is into - actually maybe
maybe maybe so if we went tubing this
side check this wacko hold on I'll put
it put it back in actually yeah um and
then if I have a lamp so if we can fit
the 24 pin then we're probably fine
where is it at the bottom it's at the
top okay hold on new idea for RAM I was
saving this surprise for later but to go
along with my Xeon CPU I also have 16
gig sticks of Kingston singin sticks ECC
memory Oh 32 gigs of ram in here look at
all those cheetah module layout did it I
thought you know just line up the RAM oh
my god that's your job
I'm not sure yeah I don't think we're
gonna make it yeah no it's not gonna fit
the threads on this router no good so I
was going to pull the block off this one
and put it on to a single read we have
we have single rads like horribly
tangled so I wanted to use one SATA
power cable and it almost fits no see
it's pulling it out of this one
Oh nicely be doable I think okay my hold
down actually can go on any orientation
that I want which is nice so the other
ones that are really going to be hard is
audio okay so Bad's on remember the fan
has to be here the power supplies here
we're going to cover up a fair number of
the connectors on the power supply but
we still need a fan okay so the 24 pin
is going this way okay so we don't need
to do the get a month yeah yeah Wow okay
I think it can make it alright then
let's get the power supply out of here
and try to more properly note since
those yeah if I can find something
threaded correctly that I can just screw
into the backplate do you think you have
anything like that
I have no idea okay so here's the random
screw we found you've been yes totally
worried before no but it doesn't matter
all the rest are fine good cool I think
cooling is gonna be a trick in a system
like this let's put on some nice fresh
fresh coupe oh wow okay Oh where'd the
mat go huh ah ba ba ba SATA cables I
can't find the washer I mean just to use
a nut in each corner and that can go all
the way down now
oh there's two other SATA ports if
they're easy yep okay front audio
harddrive led is bottom-left para ladies
top left okay well okay so that's ready
now we're graphics card oh oh this is
going the wrong way
why because they've no grill
you know what I'm actually going to put
all four in know about it is yeah so we
get the same real quick it's not great
but like there's this yeah yes what kind
of King exactly
okay you know we're gonna discover
something yeah yeah yeah wait are you
you going in backwards
no derp Maria good call I was not pay
attention to cars my oh you had a slide
and I'm not privy to and it's
fantastical not a small power spot oh
nice more um that doesn't work - drew I
think we should do two drives can they
fit on the top of the power supply there
might just be a little bulge there might
be a little bulge but if we're doing it
yeah let's just do it go go wait uh oh
that is gonna add additional to a lot of
it you know what um my super low profile
double-sided tape strips that I
collected a bazillion years ago
so we'll go just like that oh I'm happy
we have these cables yeah they shouldn't
affect airflow at all
no and actually any of the places nope
there that's pretty clean
I like braided it could we bring these
further back and make it work okay these
ones right yeah oh I don't
yeah there you go
I have to try and get this front panel
and somehow I wanted one no I just I
have to get all the wires like in there
as opposed to around the edges there you
go there's screws that that front panel
needs to got it what an impressive
little case better than either of our
computers and like less than a fifth of
the size of either of our computers
we're done that was fun and it like
despite the incredible amount of things
that we oh no that's from me popping out
the things a little bit Raddatz you're
gonna have a little bit of bulge on the
top but it's not bad it's not very
noticeable and considering how much
hardware is in here I don't know if
Silverstone could have made it anymore
it's basically like I love the case I
don't mean this in a bad way but it's
basically a frame yeah it's a shoebox
and it's it's it's a nicely logically
laid out frame but it's yeah it's a
shoebox with holes and we filled those
holes yeah so now all that's left is to
find out does it actually work so well I
mean what else should we test we got
throat we got to find out power
consumption yeah
the power consumption we'll do a bunch
of games out throw some synthetics at
the CPU cuz that's fun
we got a seat amps on you on everything
everything no I mean it should be fine
like if you guys look it's intake on the
side for the graphics card exhaust right
out the rear with some supplementary
exhaust at the top here right there I'll
do some like spot thermal testing sure
figure out where some zones are the
entire front of the case is mesh so
that's going to take care of cooling
your CPU which is going to be liquid
cooled and then the power supply itself
is going to take heat away from the
motherboard area and push it out the
back we should actually have reasonably
balanced airflow I'm really curious to
see just how loud this sucker is as well
yeah I don't think it's going to be that
loud if we were smarter we wouldn't have
had to put SSDs on the top and I'm not
too
SST would have made a lot of sense and I
major we could have also there's enough
space here that we might have even be
able to just stack them right there
right on the side instead of them being
on the top but what's I think it looks
really cool let's cool on the top yeah
so uh yeah well here you go all right
wow that weighs a lot more than you
expect performance time all right so
let's start with thermals it's always an
important question with a small powerful
contained system like this one
I mean loads of people buy full tower
cases just for the juicy airflow and we
have a lot of power under the hood
including a Titan X which is a hot
running card the Titan X performs pretty
much just as expected in terms of
thermals which was really hot the Titan
X is normally quite hot and not much
changed here to be completely honest as
it was able to breathe fairly easily
through the side of the case but the CPU
on the other hand was a little more
surprising yeah we already knew it was
pretty low temperature running processor
but it really didn't have the card
stacked in its favour overclocked a bit
and with next to no air to breathe
due to the confined space the fact that
it went under a full-size power supply
and cables running freakin everywhere
etc I honestly wasn't expecting much but
it pulled through at a very low
temperature under load which was damn
impressive and made me believe in this
setup just that much more speaking of
overclocks our Titan X had its core
cranked up to about 1375 which is about
the same as we had it when we reviewed
it if you want to see our actual review
of this card click here the processor
had a base clock increase of 3 megahertz
and no voltage increases across the
board this little black box of Awesome
crushed our 4k gaming benchmarks for
Crysis 3 BioShock Infinite and grand
theft auto 5 running all of them without
a hitch and getting well over 60 frames
per second despite the 4k setting and
never having any of the presets below hi
pretty badass for a machine that you
could easily fit in a backpack but this
didn't really flex the muscles of the
CPU I mean it barely even has to try
they see if you use utilization
throughout these tests was pretty crazy
low so let's take it for a spin
first up we've got Cinebench r15 a good
standard for CPU benchmarks and as
always I'd like to give a show
- the awesome Cinebench community on the
Alana's tek-tips forum our 36th red
power house was very fun to watch as
I've never seen that many little yellow
squares racing around the picture
anyways as expected it crushed but it
wasn't done there w prime a
multi-threaded benchmark that calculates
super crazy numbers that take a long
time to calculate the idea here was to
show the difference between the
ever-popular fourth red CPU and a 36th
red insanity CPU so I set w prime to
four threads and 36 threat obviously the
36th third processor smashed through the
benchmark and I know you're probably not
going to be sitting there all day trying
to calculate crazy numbers with your
processor so it probably doesn't matter
to you unless your name is whaler
underscore 99 or happened to be a member
of the best day and folding team in the
world on the Linus tech tips forum
