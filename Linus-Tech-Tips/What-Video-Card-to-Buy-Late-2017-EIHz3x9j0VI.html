time of year to spend your hard-earned
money on gaming upgrades manufacturers
know this well and the last quarter of
the year is typically so chock-full of
new products and promotions that it can
become impossible to keep track of them
all so with all the different options
out there how do you figure out which
car delivers the best value for your
dollar well you could spend a few days
compiling the mother of all benchmarking
data spreadsheets or you could just
watch this video because we kind of did
all the work for you
just like toddle bear does all the work
of setting up a VPN for you to try on a
bear for free go to Tunnel Bear comm /l
tt we've got that linked below
if you don't feel like watching the rest
of this honestly that's fine
we've got recommendations for 1080p
1440p and 4k 60fps gaming linked in the
description below if you want to learn
about how we got to those conclusions
then watch on just like last year we
need to start by defining value value is
not determined by price alone but by how
much performance you get for that price
so we might recommend expensive cards
that you wouldn't consider affordable
and still be able to call them a great
value next we need to ensure that for
every recommendation in this guide the
real-world performance that you'll get
will actually be enough for the
resolution you want to run your games at
if we just looked at value by itself we
could end up telling you to go buy a
seven dollar el cheapo graphics card
that gets two frames per second that
would be fantastic FPS per dollar but a
terrible gaming experience so what would
be the friggin point on that subject we
are going to be focusing then on three
main categories of gamer all that high
detail settings 1080p 1440p and 4k which
is why you actually won't then see any
budget card recommendations they weren't
able to meet our minimum performance
requirements regardless of how great of
a value they were so our methodology for
finding the best values out there was
pretty similar to last year now due to
how cards clock speeds are determined
these days with heavy emphasis on
automatic tuning that's done through GPU
boost we will not be focusing on the
minimal performance Delta's that might
exist between vendors gtx 1080 and then
their Em's GTX 1080
because even a factory overclocked 1080
GPU on the fancy gigantic card is going
to end up a lot closer to a normal
Founders edition 1080 than it will to a
like 1080i something
a completely different GPU and this
general rule is true throughout both AMD
and NVIDIA line ups as for which GPUs we
looked at we limited ourselves to ones
that are actually available for purchase
brand-new directly from a large
reputable seller so we picked the three
lowest priced models of each one from
Amazon and Newegg then averaged them so
that we could be confident that you can
actually go buy something at about the
pricing we're using in our value
calculations we specifically left out
used hardware and the reason for that is
because while an older gentleman and
deliver decent performance at the same
time it won't be covered by warranty in
all but a few cases and not everyone's
comfortable with that and we've actually
run into situations before where we've
gone and recommended some second-hand
hardware only to see the demand and
therefore pricing shoot up shortly after
we published our video ok with me so far
now let's talk about our performance
metrics obviously testing over 40 cards
and three resolutions in a wide enough
variety of games to give solid
recommendations wasn't going to be
feasible so instead of trying to find
the actual frames per second of every
card in every game like last year we
used one card that was very likely to
show up on performance charts at all
three of these resolutions from
reputable sites like guru 3d and PC
perspective and then we logged the
relative performance of any of our cards
that we could find
compared to that reference then we used
that relative performance to extrapolate
what the expected FPS might be now in
some cases we had to extrapolate from an
extrapolation and then everything got a
little fuzzy for a while and I think at
some point we were visited by the
spreadsheet fairy but anyway the point
is it is imperfect we know thanks to the
amount of data we collected including
benchmarks from FPS RTS and RPG games
we're confident that after applying a
common sense
filter like we ignored products outright
that will obviously thermal throttle
we've got a pretty clear picture of
which cards will perform consistently
better and which ones will perform
consistently worse so at 1080p there are
only really a couple of choices for Team
red the RX 570 and 580 were far and away
the best there little brother the RX 560
did manage similar FPS per dollar
numbers but it wasn't able to
consistently deliver a high quality
1080p experience as for team green never
thought I'd hear myself say this but if
all you want is 1080p you can actually
save a few bucks
the 1063 gig is less powerful and has
less video memory which hurts it at
higher resolutions compared to AMD's
offerings but it met our performance bar
and on average we were able to find it
for forty to fifty dollars less moving
up to 1440p the RX 570 and 580 once
again deliver along with the 1063 gig
the highest FPS per dollar by a
significant margin
unfortunately for team green they're
offering just doesn't have enough raw
power for us to recommend it here now
with that said we aren't saying that
higher end cards are a bad idea at this
resolution the gtx 1070 and 1070 TI are
our recommendations if you want much
higher frame rates and fewer stutters
and you're willing to pay a bit of a
premium for it finally for the ballers
among you if you want a game at 4k at
high details 60fps there's really only
one choice the GTX 1080 Ti anything else
other than a Titan XP though it's FPS
per dollar would be obviously worse
since it performs about the same as a
1080 Ti would require you to turn down
your in-game settings turn down your
resolution or turn down both in order to
reach 60fps obviously there are other
factors to consider when you buy a
graphics card like in videos excellent
shadowplay game recording software that
obviously isn't supported on AMD cards
or Polaris's efficiency for
cryptocurrency mining if you want to
make a couple
with your gaming rig when you're not
busy gaming on it and then as to
individual cards well the design of the
board and cooler the length of the
warranty and any game bundles should
also weigh in to your decision but as
I've said before to narrow your search
you can find in the description of the
video
three solid choices for each resolution
