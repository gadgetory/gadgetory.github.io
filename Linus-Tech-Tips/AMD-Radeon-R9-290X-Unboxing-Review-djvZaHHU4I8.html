gets featured on the windchill bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it welcome to my unboxing and review of
one of the most anticipated graphics
card launches in recent memory this is
the r9 290x from AMD it is their new
ultimate performance flagship single GPU
card it features the same GCN
architecture as the last gen 7000 series
as well as the Wii U and the ps4 and the
Xbox one but with some performance
enhancements as well as some feature
tweaks so let's start with a quick
rundown of the specs the GPU core inside
here is clocked at 1 gigahertz which
considering that it is a fixed billion
transistor GPU core is nothing short of
very very impressive it has 4 gigs of
512 bit gddr5 memory it's got 2,816
stream processors so yeah there's more
performance and it's four gigs of gddr5
memory are running on a 512 bit bus
meaning there is massive memory
bandwidth and a ton of memory available
to it and there's a very good reason for
that it is optimized for greater than HD
gaming compared to the last generation
7970 gigahertz Edition it has twice the
pixel fillrate performance almost and
nearly double the geometry performance
so that basically means it's made to
take what the last gen could do which is
kind of two and a half K gaming amp it
up a notch and deliver that kind of
performance at 4k resolutions on the
front of the card other than the
upgraded industrial design there's not
much to talk about other than this right
here the fan has been significantly
altered versus previous generation
products so the fan profile the software
that controls it is able to ramp up and
ramp down the speeds much more slowly
making it sound less aggressive to your
ears this ties in very nicely with their
new upgraded power tuning technology so
think of it kind of like GPU boost 2.0
for AMD they're not really going to want
me to say that but let's face it so it's
taking four pillars so that is voltage
clock speed power and temperature and
then balancing the performance of the
GPU against all of those things in order
to squeeze as much performance as
possible out of the graphics card now
what AMD says is unique about their
implementation is that the voltage
control is incredibly granular and it
can switch voltage steps and around ten
microseconds meaning that it is always
pushing to squeeze as much perf as
possible out of the card now power tune
comes dialed in at 95 degrees Celsius
however you know some folks are not
necessarily comfortable with their
graphics card running at 95 degrees
it'll run at that temperature all the
time because of the way it's designed
don't worry
power tune is fully customizable so if
you decide you have a different maximum
fan speed you want or you have a
different maximum temperature you want
to see it'll adjust all the other
parameters that is clock speed therefore
performance in order to keep in line
with your expectations
now Nvidia ships their cards dialed in
at 80 degrees by default but it should
be noted that it was only a generation
or two ago that in video was also saying
it was fine for GPUs to run at 100
degrees slipping around to the top of
the card we find where the plastic
shroud is joined to the metal yoona sink
that provides cooling for the RAM and
vrm components we also find cross-market
no no crossfire connectors AMD has
tested the card in fact they left the
contact points on the PCB so that they
could actually get a wire one up to make
sure that it doesn't make a difference
and they tested it down to PCIe 8 X 2
cards running an 8 X Gen 2 and saw no
performance difference between putting
the connectors on and not putting the
connectors on so the crossfire connector
is gone on this card we also find the
power connectors so there's an 8 pin
PCIe and a 6 pin PCI II plug and finally
is the bios which has made a return so
by default it comes with uber and quiet
fan profiles in two separate biases and
you can flip between them as you want in
by default the quiet mode is closer to
the i/o panel so naturally we have gone
and put again uber mode on the rear i/o
we find ventilations so this is a blower
design card so while some air is going
to come out up here most of its going to
come out the back of the card and be
exhausted from your case as well as for
all digital outputs all digital you
might say Oh DVI to VGA no no adapter
the analog signaling is not there MD has
made some other tweet
to this though as well so check this out
two DVI ports one HDMI camera and
Eyefinity off of those reports whoa hey
now you can you can run three 1080p
monitors off DVI DVI and HDMI you can
still use DisplayPort 4i Finity but it's
totally up to you matching DVI monitors
no big deal in HDMI to DVI cable will
take care of that with no conversion
they've made some changes to the way
that they allocate resources in order to
make that possible which is very very
cool DisplayPort you can also get some
commercially available DisplayPort hubs
now which will allow you to easily run 6
displays off of this card so there is no
need for an affinity 6 Edition card
anymore now speaking of the HDMI port on
the back AMD was the first to implement
sound over HDMI on their graphics cards
a couple generations ago and they are
throwing another first status with this
card this is the second card on the
market to implement AMD's true audio
technology so that is a programmable DSP
that is built right onto the card that
is dedicated Hardware just to process
audio that means lower CPU utilization
better surround affects less pledgie
approximations of environmental effects
using reverb as well as generally more
immersive sound it does rely on support
from middleware developers as well as
from game developers so given that
there's only a couple cards in the
market right now that support it maybe
it's not going to be a huge thing yet
but in the future thumbs up AMD for
implementing that flipping over to the
back of the card we've got the GPU
itself so that's clocked at up to one
gigahertz and then we've also got ya
countin 16 memory chips so Andy has
opted to mount all of the memory on the
front of the card where it can be cooled
by that Yunis ink and because of its 512
bit memory interface it actually needs
16 memory modules in order to function
so there you go guys quite the
engineering feat cramming all of that in
there while we're back here I want to
take a moment to talk about zero core
technology so when your computer is
idling and your screen turns off MD
cards can actually almost completely
turn off the graphics card so it uses
almost no power we've already seen this
before but just a reminder guys zero
Core is a thing and it does help save
power if you're not the kind of person
who always puts their computer to sleep
or turns it off when there
using it next up we've got mantle which
is a potential game changer it's going
to be supported by this card and all GCN
architecture cards it is a new API that
allows more direct communication between
the game engine itself and the hardware
inside your graphics card rather than
going through DirectX which is an
intermediary layer that doesn't allow
for the same kind of bare metal
programming for an individual graphics
card architecture it's not the same as a
next-gen console even though they use a
GCN architecture but AMD is hoping that
because of the similar architectures
some of the principles that developers
are using to optimize on those consoles
can be used through mantle to get better
performance on AMD cards it will rely
heavily on developer support so
battlefield 4 is going to have mantle
support coming in December and at their
developer conference in November 2013 we
are expecting to see announcements from
a lot of other developers based on the
rumors that I've heard chirping around
now before we get into performance
numbers I want to talk about
overclocking we run all of our cards
overclocked and overclocking is very
different on 290x so instead of the
traditional clock speed slider and fan
speed slider now you set a maximum fan
speed and you have a little heat map
grid within AMD's overdrive utility that
allows you to see how the settings
you're applying and it's a percentage
based overclock now not a plot speed
based overclock affect both the clock
speed as well as the temperature and the
power targets and how all those things
work together so you're going to want to
spend a little bit of time learning
about that before you go and try and
overclock this card now for us we were
running an uber mode we ran at 1080p and
then we did a special head-to-head
battle between r9 290x and GTX 780 at
two and a half K however we don't have a
4k monitor at this time an AMD informs
me that the 290x doesn't really stretch
its legs and show its mettle until you
hook it up to a 4k display without
further adue off to use like there has
been a ton of anticipation over these
numbers so I'm just going to go right
into it and something that a lot of
people are going to notice right off the
bat is that this card is not actually
topping our charts to explain we have
been running our graphics card tests for
quite a while now with everything
overclocked to the wall
and this test is no different we're
running everything overclocked as much
as possible and we found the 290x
actually comes out of the box quite
aggressively clocked and there isn't a
ton of headroom left now we were
interested when it started not being at
the top of our charts so I did a little
bit of Investigation and when the 780
and 290x are both at stock the 290 X and
the 780 often switched position the 290
X is actually usually on top but we on
all of our tests overclocked so moving
on another thing to note is that this
card is about $550 and a 780 is about
650 dollars maybe give a few more
depending on where you are now at about
20% cheaper in our 1080p benchmarks it's
only 10% slower jumping to 2560 by 1440
P we noticed actually that the story got
even sweeter at about only 5% loss in
performance that makes that whole price
performance thing even better we were
seeing 10% on 1080p and now we're only
seeing 5% that's great
moving up to 4k it's supposed to be even
better we unfortunately don't have those
numbers as we don't have a screen that
can support that though another thing to
note is that with star citizen
everything is kind of skewed that game
is not released yet that game is not
optimized yet and I can I think it's
going to happen but mantle is not on it
yet at all so those three things will
actually change the game a ton we just
wanted to include it because star
citizen no actual real logical reason we
just wanted to show how it's performing
right now just in case you're one of
those guys that's going to jump on the
hanger module that's going to jump on
dogfighting that's going to jump on
everything in the future because you're
big follower star Susan and we know
there's a ton of you out there if you
liked the video like the video if you
just liked the video dislike the video
and in the comments below what are you
going for are you going for that
sensible price per performance route are
you going for the hardcore I want to be
at the top of the charts with crazy
amounts of overclocking all that kind of
stuff angle what is your angle and oh as
