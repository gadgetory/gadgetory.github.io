machinery Miss Daisy
piecing yeah so today we're going to put
all of the actual hardware together and
put it all in there
so we'll be taking this out and mounting
everything onto the back of this so
we're not really doing a ton with the
actual tank yet itself speaking of
mounting will be doing the biggest penis
tease ever where we put everything in
there and then don't actually dump any
oil into it
yeah corsair gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more so I'll start on the hardware
here and then I guess Luke can get
started prepping the actual tank from
air pumping bubbles as well as rocks and
before we get started we need to be sure
your rocks are cleaned up good for good
alright then here we go oh yeah I guess
I'm yeah why don't you leave that in
there for now yeah well I need to be
looking at Saturday
I'll meet these very soon so I'll just
hold on to them the Predators because
I'm thinking send up the only predators
around here editor memory predator
sexual predators bestow some sort of
their memories yeah
predator man where he spoken like a true
haha I'm prepping what we're gonna have
in the bottom of the tank one thing
that's gonna make this a lot easier than
when I did it was my power supply was
being to the bottom and this one there's
nothing actually really against the
bottom because the power supply is going
to be coming from here on the actual
it's going to mount it in the top so
that would be nice because then you can
lift the entire system out without
having any issues whenever I tried to
lift mine up the power spot was hanging
about it will you know that's I was not
good at all and it'll help with just
space on the bottom having nothing
actually sitting there so we're going to
see I hope I'm pretty sure that these
suction cups on these are going to be
totally silicon which should be fine and
have nothing to do with rubber because
if they have anything to do with rubber
at all that'll be a big row so you're
saying that we're not going to use any
robert is like a serious issue it just
doesn't it just doesn't work
now EVGA is the only one with a with an
m ATX x99 motherboard at the time of
filming this so that was why we opted to
go with them for this particular build
because we wanted to use an oil cooled
pc tank that wasn't so big that it was
going to be basically impossible to move
it and huge it also said that this is
one of their this is one of their new
models so they wanted us to check this
one out as a postponements been around
for a long time so that's pretty much it
for cpu installation anyway that's why
that's why we went ahead and chose this
board now i'm gonna have to remove stuff
like this see these these could easily
be rubber these little these little port
covers so we're going to want to remove
anything like that on the motherboard
before we submerge this
boy like bolts or anything in this
baggie did we take anything out of it
did you clean them perhaps yeah and they
went somewhere it was drying it could it
be these ones over here on my shelf in
the magnet oh yeah well we did somewhere
safe so that's good
exactly where it's supposed to be on a
magnetic parts tray nothing can be lost
I'll tell you what I'll look at the
picture on the front of the manual yeah
it seems pretty self-explanatory
go like this
are you actually little Tiki
no I am not working I can't work yeah
this does not look like work yeah if
that qualifies as work then you're all
fired
I just don't love that eight heat pipes
Perseid sexy
hard now that's going on there
that is that is sexy even if you're not
into computers you have to appreciate
that the sector leaders for the Oba
known to I even know that's cool like
that that is looking good Hey
All Right see you later he's not allowed
to buddy what never mind
here's a pro tip for anyone watching use
your tip UGA gives you like super nice
included kibbles debris yeah no I've no
idea what phrases ok ok yes I mean
glasses I thought oh it's taller
is it quite a lot Wow yeah not bad yeah
okay so now is moment of truth time
you're a little bit down there you I
don't think that's gonna make anyway
you're right up against the card okay
just
I'll just calm down for a second I think
we might have to be innovative here
sometimes innovation involves surgery I
think we might be performing graphics
card surgery
yeah we're just cuz this is just plastic
shroud up till here right okay sure why
don't you do that then and I'll hold
another board back in because we got to
do cable management for the attempt
sensory power there's no way I'm going
to leave it hanging across that cross
everything like this is for the other
even with the kid I'd still say this is
an intermediate to advanced PC builder
finish oh my god oh wow you gotta get
over gun Oh what good it's a pretty sexy
card wow that is so baller oh my
goodness I'm so over help I guess if the
idea was for us to use like crazy
overbuilt components then we achieved
that goal we did in real good you guys
have to circumcise a graphics card still
functional too small yeah note that leaf
is are in the correct PPE this glove
doesn't fit look at where the knuckle
spots are
well this one takes some cleaning up but
is that so far I'll have to clean up
this because it like melt it over now
luckily because of rain it actually
looks pretty clean
all right motherboard in okay here we go
guide me goose oh nice you find this
Papa needs a video Wow that is
surprisingly clean for pin that's right
I am looking forward to powering this
bad boy everything is hard everything is
difficult about builds like this
so while Luke's indisposed finding if we
can use LED lighting and our setup here
I'm going to do a quick post because you
test the hardware of course before you
you know assemble it and then first for
a build like this it's a really good
idea to also do a test before you fill
it with oil so it's very important at
this stage to not plug in the pump
because if the pump runs dry which it
would be there's no way with water in it
then it will destroy it pretty much
instantly so our pump has not plugged in
all so we're not going to want to run it
for a very long time because if we were
to do that then the CPU would overheat
because it doesn't actually have a fan
on it so on board power button moment of
truth time is she work
apparently that postcode can be caused
by a loose neck oh oh I didn't plug
in the CPU connector well that would be
it wouldn't it I was all stressed out
postcode c4 EVGA means this EP we're not
getting any power there so we're gonna
go ahead and plug that there CPU power
in okay there okay that's that's more
like it this is more like what we expect
to see that's a good sign I guess I
shouldn't worry too much about to see
for you having overheated before rather
you getting any power we thought maybe
we do a quick post test hey wrong input
so I managed to not plug in the eight
pin and then have the wrong input on my
motherboard but the good news is that it
all worked out order and our system
house which is like super important yes
that's like three quarters of the battle
like this okay well we are just about
set up we're just about done here then
actually Debbie's 37 meter
yes sir oh oh thank you up in there okay
oh oh
are you okay I don't like DMX or
something y'all gonna make me light my
case ah like the least hardcore thing
you could say yeah
just put it in the way there that it
looks so good there you know so it's
good
hey well what's this warranty void if
remove sticker that's awful
no oh that's even worse
the warranty void if remove sticker is
ugly don't realize it'll be busy hello
hey maybe the canteen work that people
already feel a little bit you want to
hold it better yet another thing about
this build it barely needed let's do
this one first I just want to make sure
that these are in the right spot that's
all the King really did stage 2 is whoa
hold on we're plugged in stage 2 we
think is done there's the circuit all
XML please multiple set that is a really
nice oil cool machine it's not about the
back experience you know other than
looking at the rats I can show you if
you were to focus on the cheeks okay
well guys thanks for watching I like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment letting
us know if your feelings more
complicated than this
I'm as always check out the link in the

affiliate codes we get a small kickback
whenever you buy rubbing alcohol or
pliers for castles castles an entire
castle I'm building castles in the sand
