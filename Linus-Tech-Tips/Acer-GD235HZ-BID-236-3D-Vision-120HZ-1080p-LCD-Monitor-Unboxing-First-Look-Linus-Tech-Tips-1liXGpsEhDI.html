cameraman who is us he did in a very
comfortable chair I will be unboxing a
sirs 23 inch 3d vision ready monitor so
this is a 120 Hertz monitor it's
widescreen Full HD resolution but what's
special about it I mean more special
than the you know striking stunning good
looks orange accents and excellent
response times you know all that good
stuff is the 120 Hertz refresh rate so
that means that even if you aren't using
3d vision the 120 Hertz refresh rate
gives you the benefit of twice as many
updates on your screen every second as a
conventional 60 Hertz LCD so besides the
fact that you're able to run at HD
resolution you're able to run it sort of
with with twice as much information
going through the monitor as you would
otherwise have access to so it means
that every image that changes you're
gonna see it just that much faster than
if you were using a conventional 60
Hertz LCD so I'm kind of digging up some
of the accessories here and I'm going to
show you all of this in just a minute
this is a bit of a precursor to a video
that I'll be doing shortly on 3d vision
surround so if you actually you can see
if you sort of pan around here I've got
three of these bad boys that I'm going
to be using to run and videos 3d vision
surround setup I will have one monitor
in the center giving me my crosshairs as
well as whatever's going on right in
front of my character if I'm running an
FPS game and then with the two other
monitors I'm going to have peripheral
vision and there goes the stand okay and
so that's going to give me that that
immersiveness that is has not been
possible in the past with any gaming
technology unless you get out into the
really really extreme boutique stuff
that realistically the average consumer
can't afford so everything that's
included first we have an HDMI cable
next we have an audio cable so there is
actually an audio out jack on the bottom
of the monitor
next we have a dual link DVI cable and
the reason you need a dual link DVI
cable is that when you're running even
at a 1920 by 1080 resolution if you're
running at 120 Hertz versus 60 Hertz the
computer has to send twice as much data
to the monitor so you can't use a single
link cable next we have a VGA cable and
then we've also got a power cable so
let's have a look at the monitor that
I've already assembled over here rather
than waiting for me to assemble it
although the assembly process is quite
simple all you need to do is take the
base which you can see comes on on metal
stand with little rubber feet so that
it's not going to move it's got a little
clip on the back you just drop the
monitor right onto the base the monitor
itself has ah here we go
it has tilt adjustment but no other
adjustments so you're not you don't have
any pivot or any swivel or anything like
that but let's have a look at the
overall back in the monitor so I've
already got a couple things plugged into
this one but you can see we've got a
pretty good a fair number of options for
input so we've got VGA in as well as DVI
in so that's the one that I'm using DVI
dual link and then we have HDMI in so
you can use any one of those three then
we have one audio out port as well as
the power in the back also features a
vase amount so if you are lucky enough
or wealthy enough I guess to buy three
of these monitors you can also have the
option of buying a triple armed stand so
then rather than having them all sitting
on their little stands here you can
actually just have one stand on the
center monitor have an arm reaching out
to mount each of the monitors on their
sides I don't actually have the benefit
of one of those unfortunately but that
would be a very very cool way to mount
these monitors in terms of the on-screen
display but the on-screen display is
controlled by the power button here as
well as one two three four five buttons
positioned just under the monitor they
are a little bit recessed and maybe I
can lean this back so you can have a
look at there they are
so five buttons indicated by little dots
so you can find them quite easily and
other
that I mean really what I what I like
most about this monitor personally is
the striking styling so it's got C this
is how it's done right actually I want
to sort of harp on this a little bit you
see so many companies releasing LCD
monitors that have like a black in some
color they're adding like some kind of a
design element to the bezel and while I
appreciate sort of a style and and a bit
of flair put into a product I like it
somewhere where I can ignore it or even
cover it up if I don't like it so while
I do like the orange accents on this
monitor particularly actually here I
want to show you the base here this one
is actually made of metal here it's got
kind of a brushed looking finish on it
it's quite shiny looks great these ones
are plastic but they still look alright
to I could just paint over these if I
felt like it and then it becomes a black
monitor whereas a lot of the time you're
not really left with the option of
covering it up somehow if you don't like
it so I really like that about this
monitor I think one thing I haven't
mentioned yet is that ad has a two
millisecond response time and that's
part of what enables it to refresh the
image completely every 120 times per
second so please stay tuned on my video
blog I'm going to be doing lots more
updates on these monitors as well as
Nvidia surround gaming without 3d and
then additionally with NVIDIA surround
gaming with 3d so thank you for checking
out my video blog don't forget to
subscribe and that's all for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
