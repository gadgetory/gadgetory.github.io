unusual video for us
I guess I'll jump right into it this box
of stuff is from printer Studio dot CA
we do want to have a merchandise store
for Linus tech tip stuff at some point I
Cafe Press doesn't look that feasible
because it's extremely expensive
obviously stockpiling a whole bunch of
shirts in like you know a house doesn't
make a whole lot of sense and you'd have
to deal with all the shipping and
logistics so we were looking for someone
that can do high-quality printing very
quickly and is able to ship worldwide
with reasonable rates and so it turns
out that printer studio CA is run by a
relative of an old co-worker of mine so
I got the hook up on a test order so
that I could have a look at some of the
stuff so I actually let my wife do this
which is why you're gonna find playing
cards with my son on them as well as
playing cards with my cat on them and
playing cards with she and I on them we
also got some greeting cards so these
are with the baby I think the thought in
her mind was we'll use these to send two
people to one see him and don't have
facebook or something I don't know
whatever she ordered whatever she
thought was she thought was right at the
time overall the printing on them looks
outstanding it was reasonably quick so
we are definitely considering going with
these guys in for us like some kind of a
merchandise store I think there's
another another different card design on
the back there you also include
envelopes with the cards I wanted to see
what it looks like when they print on
things that are not not playing cards
and not not cards not necessarily paper
although this clock was was actually a
paper design it turned out so it ended
up being paper but there's a bunch of
different pictures again of the baby
because my wife did this what we're
probably going to do now that this has
gone well as we're gonna do another test
run of maybe designing some - tek-tips
merchandise and doing a test order of
that but there you have it guys
printer studio da da looks like they
might be a partner for us
their configurator is reasonably easy to
use so you go there's a bunch of bunch
of pictures of that on a little clock
you throw a battery in there and it's
good to go
I would recommend checking it out if you
do want to get anything done that's
completely custom and I will also be
giving away on the Linus tech tips forum
so head over there and stay tuned for
this
it'll be shortly after the video goes up
so I'm gonna have a couple of fifty
dollar gift certificate for our members
order from them and then let us know how
the service you get is and and how the
quality of the merchandise looks because
that's gonna affect our decision to go
with these guys in the longer term here
so here's a little diaper bag that has
again a picture of the baby on it looks
outstanding actually the the printing
looks really great very vibrant the
blacks are quite deep you can tell
because you can compare it against an
actual black material right here and
yeah good and then I think the last
thing here is a an apron like I said my
wife ordered this stuff I didn't pick
the stuff but here's the apron I think
it's supposed to be actually a kid sized
apron but actually I don't know what
it's supposed to be but same thing
printing actually looks outstanding so
I'm look forward to hearing back from
the forum members who get us that
feedback and you may have a viable
option here so again guys that's printer
studio dot CA they do ship worldwide and
I'm happy to support sort of my friends
