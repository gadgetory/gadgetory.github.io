from CES 2017 learn more about their
rise and processors at the link in the
video description so behind me is the
sony xperia projector they're not giving
us a price they're not giving us any
concrete specs but they are telling us
how it is intended to work now I've seen
projected touchscreen interfaces before
there was kind of a weird keyboard like
take your keyboard with you anywhere
thing but it didn't really work that
well this is a whole other level this is
a full-fledged Android experience that
is projected simply by putting it down
on a table onto a 23 inch display with
10-point multi-touch and it's got a
bunch of other cool stuff in it as well
dual microphones for okay Google stereo
speakers it's got an infrared sensor on
the bottom that's how it handles
multi-touch it's got NFC Bluetooth Wi-Fi
it's got a 13 megapixel camera which
I'll talk a little bit more about why
you would want a block in the middle of
your dining room table with a camera on
it later
and finally it's got a built in battery
that's going to have a capacity
somewhere in between unplug it to move
it somewhere else without rebooting it
and actually watching a movie on it so
use case number one is pretty simple
let's say you're in oh I don't know the
kitchen being able to sit and read the
news or plan out your day while you're
eating your cereal without getting you
know milk all over your phone your
tablet I'm liking this what about
cooking now you've got a 23 inch display
that you can interact with and see your
recipe and once you've you know gotten
everything all messy like I know I do
you go ahead you cover the infrared
sensor wipe it up freakin fantastic love
it moving over to the dining room table
multiplayer gaming on Android yeah it
sucks doesn't it why does it suck not
because there aren't games actually but
the fact that the screens are so small
means you're really not having a very
interactive experience or you're bumping
heads it gets a little too interactive
so they did a demo where I'm playing
this game head-to-head against one of
the Sony reps and it actually feels like
sitting and playing a board game
freaking cool so whether you're looking
at like photos or you're you know
collaborating on a document or something
I'm liking that too but you flip it up
now you're in the living room I like
this one best so by moving it 25
centimeters away from the wall you can
get up to an ATM
screen is it competitive with a
multi-thousand dollar projector come on
get real yes it's a laser projector but
no that's dumb but if you're in a dorm
or something like that you've got some
friends over
it is absolutely an acceptable way to
watch a movie and if you want to play
games they've got Italian with
Playstation so let's say you live in a
multi-screen house someone wants the TV
you go okay well I'll just grab the
projector head over somewhere else and I
can play off the PlayStation remotely
over the Wi-Fi likin that - last but not
least let's get back to the camera Skype
calls cool right okay the Wi-Fi in the
hotel sucked so we couldn't actually
perform a Skype call but you can see in
the preview here that the wide-angle
view of us on the couch actually looks
pretty darn good by on a couch I of
course mean huddled together behind the
tripod so there's a couple use cases for
it but of course there are going to be
more so let me know in the comments guys
if you can think of what you would use a
little kind of flexible pocket projector
like this for so thanks for watching our
content from CES 2017 guys make sure you
hit that subscribe button and make sure
you check out our sponsor for this video
AMD they've got a bunch of information
about their new Vega GPU architecture
you can head over to Vega VGA we'll have
that linked in the video description but
this is a whole other way of handling
graphics we've seen it running Doom at
4k 60fps absolutely maxed out settings
live and you are going to want to get
all the details because you're a big
nerd like me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
