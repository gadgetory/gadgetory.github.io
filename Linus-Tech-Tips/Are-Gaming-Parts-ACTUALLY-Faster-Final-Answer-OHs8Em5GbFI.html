dreaming has been slapped on pretty much
everything at this point I mean we're
talking from stuff that makes sense like
mice and video cards all the way to
glasses or chairs but does using gaming
components actually make your pc better
for gaming well we built these two PC's
and tested them head-to-head to find out
and we're going to tell you after these
messages from total bear total bear
thinks the Internet is better when
everyone can openly access the same
content try total bear for free at total
bear comm /l TT
so our methodology was pretty simple we
started with a well balanced machine
core i5 8400 16 gigs of RAM GTX 10 70 m2
SSD etc then we replicated the exact
same config as closely as possible
except that to the best of our ability
we replaced every single component with
a gaming version of the same thing so if
it didn't have something about calling
up your squad or just gaming right in
the product name it was out it actually
ended up being a lot easier than we
thought so we have not only easy ones
like gaming graphics card and gaming
motherboard but also a gaming SSD gaming
power supplying gaming a i/o cooler even
our case fans are all gaming doubt we
look at this look at this packaging
according to these blurbs from the
manufacturers their hardware will
deliver upon us a new era of gaming it
will bring a real body blow to your
opponent's weak point for massive damage
and even enable one to master the
decisive moments and succeed in all
attacks wow that sounds great let's fire
up some synthetic tests - oh no well
this can't be right what what all these
numbers are within 3% of one another
whatever in the world could be happening
I was promised a new era of body blows
and decisive moment mastery success
maybe to have the amazing gaming
experience advertised on the box
I have to play real games no no again
this is consistent with what we got
earlier on just what in the hell is
going on here okay in all seriousness
though let's talk about what happened
here many of you probably saw this
coming but it turns out that slapping a
gaming moniker on a product and adding
some RGB and fancy styling does not make
it magically perform noticeably better
the only things that affects the
performance of a PC are its actual specs
the clock speeds of the given products
inside it and potentially cooling for
example when we clocked our reference
non-gaming gtx 1070 graphics card to
match the speeds of the gaming version
the results equalized so why is everyone
putting gaming in their product names
well our first guess was that they
wanted to charge suckers more for it but
while your mileage may vary depending on
the particular models you choose and how
much you're willing to drop on
additional enhancement elements like RGB
lighting and custom power supply cables
our gaming machine ended up costing
about the same as our vanilla one and
actually included some tangible benefits
first up our GPU came with a higher
boost clock out of the box which it was
easily able to maintain thanks to its
enhanced cooling gaming class cards also
tend to come with extras like multiple
temperature sensors or OC switches that
make kicking them into a higher gear a
one-click affair second yeah we have to
bring it up style our gaming machines
looks immediately tell us what she was
built for some manufacturers like isus
even enable you to sync your system and
graphics card lighting via their
software with that said more and more
these days even vanilla parts like the
Asus
I'm Z 378 in our non-gaming machine come
with RGB capabilities so some people
like a nondescript box tucked under
their desk churning out dem frames while
others prefer the other this one is
clearly subjective but we had to mention
it bringing us to number 3 gaming parts
often come bundled with game codes or
paraphernalia like do not enter I'm
gaming door hangers and gaming related
stickers and that's it that's about all
we came up with our 2 systems cost about
the same perform about the same and
their quality is about the same soul
then why dump so much money into the
development and marketing of these
products if they perform the same why
does ROG even exist well because even
though the base level of these gaming
branded products do actually cost about
the same what these brands do are a
couple of things number one is they
allow companies to create halo models
that do sell for a lot more for the
people out there who value bragging
rights above performance per dollar and
then number two is that even for that
regular stuff that doesn't make more
money as marketing strategies go it
seems to be working really well when we
did our last audit of orders through our
Amazon affiliate code we actually found
that even for a category like video
cards which never used to have gaming in
the name since I think the manufacturers
figured it was implied gaming models
were out selling their non gaming
counterparts significantly so there you
have it
Gaming doesn't make it faster but it
also doesn't necessarily make it slower
so I think the real takeaway here is
um come to think of it what did we learn
