has two million views it looks like crap
time for an HD remake and it's not just
a pure sellout move to capitalize on an
idea that we already know works because
a lot more has changed since that video
then our production values around here
in particular AMD's high performance
not to mention huge and hot 180 watt
thread Ripper CPUs are pushing the
limits of all types of cooling systems
in ways that we haven't never seen
before so what's the ultimate cooler for
the ultimate CPU we have the answer
the white dark bass pro 900 from be
quiet features a modular design to
support a variety of layouts and
configurations check it out at the link
below we'll be testing six coolers that
on previous platforms have delivered
comparable results three air and three
liquid four water coolers MD helpfully
provided an ASA tech compatible TR for
mount in the CPU box so we're able to
use our existing stable of compatible
course our H series a iOS which is cool
because that means so can you we've got
120 millimeter 240 millimeter and 280
millimeter radiator versions with all of
them featuring the same ASA tech design
CPU block and in the H 115 eyes case a
slightly more powerful pump in a stroke
of either luck or AMD foresight the
blocks are just big enough that even
though the heat spreader sticks out the
heat producing die area for thread
Ripper is covered so while these are
mainly meant for more square cpus we
have no reason to believe that you
should worry about it as for our air
coolers well due to their wildly varying
shapes and mounting mechanisms not many
of them have been retrofitted with
support for socket tr4 yet which is
where naktu as new line-up comes in
they're visually and for the most part
functionally identical to their non tr4
cousins but when you turn them over you
are immediately greeted with plates big
and shiny enough to host a fancy dinner
party this huge mount is common on each
of them right down to the 92 millimeter
Nhu 9 because Noctua
decided to bake in support for AMD's on
socket mounting points a good idea
because well let's just say that taking
this apart isn't a good idea now to
testing while our old standard death
version of this video discussed
performance with different
and configurations inside a case our
video today will focus on the
temperature differences between the
coolers themselves right out of the box
so it should then be noted that you
could get slightly better performance
out of these AI OS by adding more fans
in a push-pull configuration and the
same can be said of the two tower
coolers another trick up our sleeve this
time around is that we're going to be
running our thread Ripper nineteen fifty
X in both stock and overclocked
configurations furthermore this time we
are in a climate controlled twenty four
degrees Celsius environment not my
garage during the winter so our results
should be more comparable to what you
can achieve at home but enough talk
let's do the results starting off then
with our H Adi GT and Noctua n hu nine
we're seeing some pretty ok numbers for
stock performance with similar low
temperatures and package power
overclocked on the other hand shows
again similar numbers but markedly lower
package power for the H Adi GT meaning
that it's throttling more to maintain
that same 87 degrees so in the
lightweight category air cooling comes
away with a clear victory the next step
up is the NH u 12 s and H 100 IV two and
again we see almost identical numbers
between these guys at stock speeds
looking now at the overclocking results
we've got a much narrower lead for the
Noctua fan over the corsair AIO as far
as package power goes meaning that
they've throttled just about evenly so
we're gonna call this one a tie bringing
us to the main event the Nhu 14 s
weather versus the h 115 i've rhaegar
both of them lasted all 12 rounds
maintaining maximum performance in both
the stock and overclocked tests and this
is incredible considering we've got all
16 cores pinned to 3.9 gigahertz but
this kind of a match isn't about pinning
and the knock - I ran a few degrees
cooler so we have to award it the win by
technical knockout of course performance
is only part of the equation aesthetics
and physical compatibility are key
considerations as well water coolers do
come with an additional mechanical point
of failure the pump but they look sexy
and it's becoming more and more common
for small form-factor cases to have
mounts for 120 or 240 millimeter
radiators but not enough clearance for
comparable air coolers and it's also
worth considering that large AIO coolers
like the h 115 i are generally far
easier to work around inside a chassis
than a larger air cooler especially
where ram slots are concerned with that
said price is kind of a big deal - and
not too as solutions even though they're
not the cheapest air coolers out there
generally come out ahead of the water
cooling equivalents by a significant
margin here so TL DR then if you're not
planning on overclocking thread ripper
it's actually a relatively easy beast to
tame but overclock it and you'll need to
set aside some budget for a beefy cooler
also if your priority is performance
you'll reach for an air cooler or custom
water cooling but water cooling is a
great choice if a more compact easy to
work in and subjectively better-looking
machine is what you're after so then as
always the answer is it depends if you
haven't already now's the time to try
