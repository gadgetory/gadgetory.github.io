Ubiquiti Networks bonded logic TRENDnet
and proto case to give this place a
complete makeover
we are partnering with antlion audio to
give away three mod mic fives and a
high-five in addition s mod mic combo
enter now at the link below it's modular
theoretically in here is everything that
we need literally as you lean all the
path all the patch cables so many patch
cables all you have to do is invest
$5,000 up front and you can make little
cable doodads saving yourself all
whopping 20 cents each every time you
print one next step don't wait filament
also cost money
3:40 it's the future because it sure
isn't today this side huh this oh crap
well that's fine cuz I had to add to
move it anyway I was just that yeah I
was doing a test that's right I was
testing to see if you were paying
attention I one is from oh let's go said
okay okay everything's good everything's
fine
how's the comb-over look oh I like it
that looks so organized it's almost like
we care what do you think of putting in
the PDU now yes this thing is pretty
cool basically it has two separate power
plugs and then it has two separate sets
of outlets so I'm hoping one of these 40
amps total is enough but just in case I
bought another one that we can return if
we don't need I'm just gonna like you're
just gonna whack it on everything
because you know Yolo oh you're opening
up the instructions you're weak Donnie
you're weak Donnie I'm warning not a pry
bar or chisel
you know what we could do is we could
align it using a power cable like if we
just throw a power cable and I know that
won't work that's really stupid okay so
we can plug these into the the UPS then
everything is fine huh just ah
everything's fine I'm fine
don't I seem fine wait what oh hold on a
second so this bad boy can go yeah and
this bad boy can go yeah oh wow
I'm fine thank you for asking yeah
hatsan what the hell
prop 65 warning handling the coded
electrical wires of this product exposes
you to lead good thing we're taking
those labels off putting on our own
labels okay so the next piece we need is
the router then right yeah okay so we
have to transplant its guts into a new
case stew it don't include this in the
video so I realized something I didn't
specify that I wanted a redundant power
supply so the one most critical
component of our network only has a
single power supply I mean it's probably
fine it's probably fine Oh what we need
to get we have to get the surveillance
VM up tonight so you want to do what you
want to get Wanek up tonight because you
want everyone to have internet yeah okay
so that means we need to change out the
rails so these are the Wanek rails it's
coming okay
oh you know I was just saying I'm gonna
slice myself open on a server rail at
some point it finally happened I better
call my wife this is the point where I
make the spousal phone call yeah where
I'm clearly not coming home on time
tonight time is it it's 5:45 everything
is fine and I am calm I'm relaxed
I just need two SATA cables everything
is fine these are known good SATA cables
nothing can go wrong
got it everything's fine I got it okay
Dennis pull it out Dennis wait wait hold
on hold on hold on okay Dennis did you
leave Dennis take the weight of the
front if you can how much do you have
don't bend your back so hold on let me
pull it back out
oh wait Dennis okay my sides in these
rails they Jam when I'm trying to get
them out there's a but that's okay I
found a solution check this out oh
butter smooth
so next order of business new wireless
access points these are the new HD wave
to Wi-Fi ones from ubiquity so we're
going to need all of this mounting I'm
just kidding we're just throwing them up
in this
Hey okay that feels good
oh I just hit the electrical box the
original plan was to replace the
explained access point over there but we
couldn't figure out a way to get at it
with the b-roll set constructed so new
plan we are cutting the cable putting on
a keystone and putting our new access
point here and that one that one will
just stay there forever
whoa it was not marked whoa which one
was Brown that seems pretty secure right
yeah yeah yeah sure okay okay
he survived
whoo
theoretically if I got in I should be
able to get out right okay cool
watch out hella here we come whoa here
we go
clover server oh well what the crap was
that
okay well that strategy might not work
let's tighten it up a little bit here
okay I need something to hammer it over
now let's go with the wine show table
then people ask why I want a crappy
table it's like you might say Linus this
is just like a an OCD thing that it goes
you know the last half an inch into the
cabinet but I mean what about what we're
doing today isn't a server room OCD
thing oh I'm so excited I'm so excited
for these to finally fit in properly
it was never the back it was this
so you've got a badass parts list here
x99 deluxe 269 50 X 32 gigs ram okay a
couple of refurbished SSDs for the boot
drive it's okay raid 1 all good and a
gtx 980 so let's get this show on the
road we're using the ram from the LMG
build it's gotten a little chipped
ok so let's find out then if I'm going
to get away with one with this cooler
here this looks really really tight oh
not a lot of clearance there um
seriously
come on I have enough problems right now
don't need PCIe plugs not going in
okay we're making awesome progress the
front looks amazing if I do say so
myself so going to be a couple more
story eaters here and then I will fill
in the blanks later on down the road but
as you can see the back could clearly
use some work and just having you look
good in the front is not good enough for
us today
so that is where the split loom cable
management stuff from cable organizer
comes in so I've got a bunch of
different colors here so that I can run
all my different types of cables
color-coded together all my fingers fine
just I'll sacrifice my fingers so the
idea is that with these cable management
things in place is that all that's it we
can pull them out and push them in
without causing a tangled mess or
causing anything to unplug because these
will keep it from catching the system
works I'm fine hey dick can you pull
these tight
should be one more you gotta pull this
one yeah okay good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
