not I actually had the ax 1000 the 850
and the 750 all at the same time but
it's taken me until now to unbox the
af-s ax ax 750 sorry about that
alright so this is the ax 750 this is an
80 plus gold Professional Series power
supply from Corsair is a high
performance power supply it's also a
very silent very efficient power supply
so I'm not going to waste too much time
looking at the box and what not
cameraman seems to be doing that for me
anyway and we're just going to open this
guy right up because he is pretty
similar to the ax 850 and the ax 1000 in
many regards the key difference is well
100 or 250 depending on which one you're
comparing it against so how many watts
of power it can help there we go finally
alright so first thing yes 80 plus gold
as I mentioned before it's also got a 7
yes 7 year warranty from Corsair which
is just outstanding on a power supply I
mean think about that in the year 2017
this power supply will still be covered
by warranty that's like having a power
supply you bought back in 2003 that
still has warranty today that's just
amazing so here is the power supply in
itself and I'm still got a couple more
stickers to break here and we'll show
you what it has attached to it in terms
of cables there it is Corsair really
does a terrific job of packaging so
you've got your nice closed cell phone
that stuff is durable no matter what you
do I use this awesome packing material
to make sure it's gonna arrive at your
house safe and sound even if you're
getting it shipped and I set a x1000 I'm
so sorry I meant ax 1200 that is a 1200
watt power supply so the difference is
actually 450
not not 250 okay so here we go we have a
power cable next we have some zip ties
as well as a powered by Corsair sticker
we have four black thumb screws little
nice touches that's what course there's
all about little nice touches black
black it's gonna match your case it's
gonna match the power supply because if
you bought them from Corsair they're
probably black alright we've got our
modular cables here so why don't we go
through those really quick first
actually and then we'll be the power
supply itself so the first ones we find
are here the next ones we find your here
and so this is a fully modular power
supply which means we've got this cable
is for the 750 ax and the 850 X only
that is your 24-pin power cable you will
pretty much need to attach that no
matter what kind of a system you're
building pretty much all right this I'm
going to tuck away for just a moment
okay here we have a four plus four pin
so that means we can either plug in
single four or we can plug in both four
eight pin power so that one you're
pretty much going to need to attach as
well next we have another four plus four
pin okay so you can actually plug this
into certain EVGA boards as well as some
other some of soos motherboards will
actually use dual 8 pin connectors so we
have full support for that next in terms
of PCI Express we have two modular PCI
Express cables and you can see these are
optimized for high end graphics cards
which means you've got two cables coming
off of each individual plug on the power
supply that means that if you're running
high in graphics cards you're pretty
much running two PCIe cables to each
graphics card so it saves you some
wiring okay so you've got support for up
to two high end graphics cards off of
this power supply next in terms of SATA
we have one two so there's just open ok
we've got a few different options here
so we've got two dual SATA and then we
have 2 quad SATA cables so you can
decide you know hey you know you want to
run a dual one up to your optical drives
you want to run a quad one down to your
hard drives where you're running a raid
10 cool you've got lots of options
that's the whole point of modular power
supplies which a lot of people seem to
have or a lot of companies seem to have
forgotten in there
design process somewhere that's what
Corsair does for you they give you
options alright then we have 2 quad
molex and then we've also got 2 molex 2
floppy adapters so that is your entire
cable complement for the ax 750 next
let's pull the cat the camera pull the
power supply out of its nice little bag
which you could keep your gym strip in
if you wanted to if you were in high
school and you still had gym strap all
right we have a 120 millimeter fan on
the bottom of the power supply it looks
like it's just built like that's
probably a panel or a Pabst or Delta or
something I actually don't know who
makes that fan but it's a very very
industrial looking fan you can really
tell with some of them that they're
built a little better than others on the
side we've got the corsair ax 750
branding here then we move around to the
back we got another ax 750 looks like
it's intended to be installed this way
up rather than the other way although it
doesn't actually matter we have a power
switch as well as our power input then
the honeycomb grill at the back which is
pretty much industry standard then we
have another Corsair brand inside here I
don't know which side I showed you
before but they're both the same but
here's a clever touch look at this so if
I install it this way in my case it's
gonna be right side up as a bottom
mounted power supply and if I install it
this way in my case at the top of the
case if I have a top mounted power
supply it's also gonna be right side up
how neat is that oh I didn't even
mention this yet this is a single 12
volt rail power supply so you can
provide up to 62 amps off that single 12
volt rail so you don't have to worry
about when you're you know plug in one
cable in here and one cable in there
well how much stuff do I have running on
each rail how much stuff do I not have
running on other rails don't worry about
that at all because it's all coming off
the same 12 volt rail this power supply
is also capable of providing nearly its
entire 750 watts that is 744 Watts off
of that single 12 volt rail outstanding
last but not least here is the modular
interface at the back of the power
supply so you can plug in let's just do
a quick rundown here so you can plug in
your 24 pin and that's going to go here
and here you can plug in your let me see
where's the where are those 4 plus 4 so
where do those go the 4 plus 4 go here
and then where else do they go I don't
know actually they do here huh
can you only plug in one of those that
can't be right
I'll be back in a moment okay I get it
yeah they actually have both have
slightly different connectors on them so
one of them plugs into this guy so this
is a dedicated four pin connector and
then the other one whoops well you gotta
plug it in the right way the other one
you have to make a choice so you can
either plug in a 4 + 4 all right and you
can use up one of these 2 slots here or
you can plug in one of your dual PCIe
connector so what Corsair is basically
saying is they don't want you powering
like a crazy board that has dual 8 pin
connectors like you know a dual socket
board off this motherboard in addition
to two high end graphics cards that's
the the limitation that they're putting
on you here which i think is more than
fair for the 750 watt unit because you
should probably be springing for like a
1200 watt unit if you're doing something
like that now in terms of other cables
you can plug in up to 5 other things so
that means you can either go with the 2
quad molex and 3 Sata's or you can go a
force or rather you can go with ya for
Sata's and then one quad molex or
whatever it is that you need so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Corsair ax 750 that is an 80 plus gold
highly efficient a highly silent power
supply and don't forget to subscribe to
