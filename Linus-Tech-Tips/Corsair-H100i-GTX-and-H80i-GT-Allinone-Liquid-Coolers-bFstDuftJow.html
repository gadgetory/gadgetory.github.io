for us from there H series of all-in-one
liquid coolers yes don't be fooled
despite the addition of GTX and GT at
the end of the model names this was not
a collaboration with Nvidia but jokes
aside these coolers promise a number of
performance improvements and some
interesting ecstatic changes as well so
stay tuned to see how they stack up and
stay subscribed to our Linus tech tips
channel to see a future video on the
megahertz myth where we take a look at
old versus new when it comes to
processors running at equal speeds
should be pretty cool
the Coolermaster no-touch tkl utilizes
genuine taupe or hybrid capacitive
switches and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
let's kick things off with a physical
overview of both units the H a di GT and
the H 100 GTX have both received fairly
substantial makeovers they now feature a
more angled look with gray accents not
only on the pump but on the radiator as
well on the H one hundred-eyed GTX and
other feature d TX models the great
design plates can be removed and swapped
out for a variety of different colors
though at the time of writing this
review not even coursers own website
have anything to say about when those
came out and none seem to be actually
available at this time although a little
snooping on the product page did reveal
what looks like a red replacement plate
lucky for us though I have the inside
hook up and have been informed that they
should be coming out sometime around me
both units feature an RGB LED on the top
logo area of the pump which can be
adjusted in the courser link software go
on is that little snap-on over the pump
magnetic mounting bracket that came on
previous generations of aged Series
coolers but now they have a kind of
hardware mounting solution which is pre
attached for Intel and has a general
twist on twist off mechanism for
swapping it out if you need AMD overall
the mounting block is fairly similar to
previous al cooler setup so the standard
backplate standoff thumb screw setup
which should be easy enough to install
the tubing has also received a bump up
with some very nice and clean looking
sleeving that has no gaps or bear
threads to gripe about which in my
opinion is pretty amazing overall the
aesthetic improvement compared to the
bare black tubes of old is pretty cool
in my opinion
the tubes also go straight into the pump
block which results in a very clean
looking finish although it doesn't feel
as flexible as the rotating arms of last
gen the included fans are the exact same
as before they cool alright at low rpms
and they can get really loud at high
rpms but they do manage to shove quite a
lot of air through your read when they
do you can configure them however you'd
like and through of course they're
linked so pick your poison the fans
aren't exactly square so they don't form
a perfect seal to the radiator but they
do manage to
their overall static pressure quite high
regardless we're going to the tubing for
the coolers the H Adi GT and h100 I GT
X's tubing runs are both quite long and
stiff resulting in some issues with a
few of our cases this might be less of a
problem for a full tower perhaps but the
tubing runs are so long it's dirty that
closing the side panel can prove to be
difficult in a few of these cases and a
little awkward if you happen to have
fans installed inside panel as well the
sturdy overall tubing plus the sleeving
does have the awesome benefit of being
very unlikely to kink which is pretty
great for people who are just trying to
avoid issues the final gripe is the
fittings yeah they can swivel and socket
which looks incredibly great and very
very clean but they don't have the
rotator arms of the previous generation
has as I brought up earlier which in
combination with the stiff tubing can
again make installation a bit tricky in
a few solutions but it does look sexy as
hell once you get it in place properly
and when you sit back and gaze upon what
you've created
it makes the fairly minor installation
issues seem entirely worth it now that
we got that out of the air I can finally
talk about how it performs and stacks up
against the rest of its competition we
had some issues getting the default fans
to run at our standard testing speed of
1100 rpm hence why they are listed at
1500 rpm on the chart do keep in mind
that they do perform well at that speed
but have a much louder overall noise
profile that being said the H ATI GT
with its thick single 120-millimeter
design had a hard time keeping up with
our super hot test bench which was
expected as our setup often throws off
coolers in that range I may dial it down
a little bit in the future but it should
perform on more reasonably overclocked
CPUs we see the H 100 i GTX flex a
little bit with its new cold plate and
pump designs that it shares with its
little brother the H ATI GT this results
in a bit of a leap from the predecessor
and slotting it in as the best cooler
under 200 80 millimetres that we tested
this time around in conclusion of course
their step their game up improved
aesthetics across the board with sleeve
tubing and cool replaceable logo plates
which can match your color scheme
improve performance through their
improved cold plate and pump design
efficiency but is it enough well I don't
think anyone who already has an H 100 or
H 100 I should run out and replace their
cooler anytime soon if it's still
working fine but anyone that wants a new
240 millimeter cooler for their build or
to replace a malfunctioning cooler this
would be a fine option and it performs
pretty damn well to boot what do you
guys think let me know in the comments
down below or over on the forums
personally I don't mind the stiff tubing
I don't think I'll really have any
problems with it and I'm totally willing
to make that sacrifice if you want to
call it that for the awesome-looking
sleeving and all that kind of stuff but
yeah let me know what you guys think
