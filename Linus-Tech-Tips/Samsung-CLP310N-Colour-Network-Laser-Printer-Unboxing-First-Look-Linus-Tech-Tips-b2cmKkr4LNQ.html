had to buy I needed a printer for a
while I don't live at home anymore so I
can't use my parents printer and I can
only print out so much stuff at work
before I get in trouble so I needed just
like a value printer I don't believe in
inkjet to be honest unless you must
print out photos at home I can't think
of a good reason to buy an inkjet
printer the nozzles dry up if you don't
use them and you know a couple months
and then you go and replace them and you
can refill them but that's a pain so I
got myself a cheap color laser printer
this color laser printer is under two
hundred dollars it's a samsung CLP 310 n
it is network ready so that means that
you don't actually have to plug it
directly into a computer you can just
plug it into your into your switch or
your router okay I actually don't know
much about it beyond the fact that it is
a cheap color laser printer so what I
can probably do once i get it setup is
share with you the results um in terms
of printing I mean I guess we can look
at the specs although i'm not a printer
expert so it does up to 2400 DPI that's
dots per inch it is ultra compact and it
operates quietly all of these are very
good things for a home use that side is
not in english this side appears to be
in english ok so its high-speed know it
uses high speed USB to point out rather
it's not high speed at all it does up to
17 pages permitted in black four pages
per minute in color that's letter size
and wow that's all it really says okay
well since we're not really going to get
any more information about this printer
from the box why don't we open it up the
reason I like lasers because compared to
ink toner is well similar in price and
compared to ink toner lasts a lot longer
so yeah you're not going to get this
printer for free with your you know
digital camera that you buy or whatever
you do actually have
to pay for a printer but the usable life
span of it will be much much longer
because you'll probably get through
years with maybe one or two toner
refills assuming you don't do a ton of
printing at home all right included
cables we have I'm just going to sort of
like do this because it's easier one
power cable so that's your standard
computer power cable okay that was it
and then we have a little thing in
French actually has no English funny
okay said something about registering
your product second read French okay
then we have a quick start guide that'll
be useful because I will want to get
started quickly and I have a box open so
naturally there are investigators who
would like to see what's in the box okay
stop before returning this product to
the store please contact support okay
you know what other documentation there
is a disk with the driver on it don't
install that download the latest from
the samsung website there is a random
piece of foam okay so let's go ahead and
flip this right over and have a look at
the printer itself you know what's a
rating I'd like to see on the outside of
printer boxes how many pages per part
Twitter cartridge I think that would be
a good thing to know because I would
actually buy like a different printer i
buy one printer over another one based
on more more pages with one cartridge of
toner that would be useful
so this printer actually uses four
separate charges cartridges it uses one
for black one for yellow one for blue
and one for pink think it's magenta cyan
and something else fails me like i said
i'm more of a motherboard and ram and
cpu expert than a printer expert i just
kind of press the button and i hope that
something comes out of it that's the
extent of what I know the reason I went
with a samsung printer I don't know if I
mentioned this already but this is
something that I did have to buy so many
of my own boxes are not products that i
paid my own hard-earned dollars but this
is one of them is because i do use a
samsung black and white one at work and
I get some ml 1610 it's been incredibly
reliable I've done a ridiculous amount
of printing on it and I've never
actually replaced the cartridge so in
here we find I guess if you need to
unjam something you would lift this up
okay so that's where the paper comes out
presumably there you have a little flap
so the paper can come out on there in
here we will find all of our toner
cartridges so you can see that the black
one is clearly larger than the colored
ones because they're going to assume
that you do a lot more black printing
than color printing they have a little
instructional thing on how to replace
your cartridges right here and let's see
if we can figure it out really quick
okay so you pull on it oh that was easy
okay so there's the black toner
cartridge remember that when you buy a
laser printer or an inkjet printer they
usually come with starter cartridges so
um yeah they're usually not actually
full well what's this oh weird so this
has like some yellow gunk in it I have
no idea what bats for so I'm going to
actually have to read the user manual if
you can tell me what this is for then
please do anyway I'm going to go ahead
and put my toner cartridge back in all
right let's see if we can find some
other features of this here network
printer
this appears to be the paper loading
tray there we go so we load in our a
four letter paper it looks like it takes
a variety of different sizes depending
how you want to adjust it and then you
just go ahead fold it over and tuck that
in there it goes in a little easily then
it seems like yeah there we go all right
and wow what is this I don't know ok
well here's more access to the inside of
guts of the printer just in case you
need it here's our interfaces so there's
your power button power input uh ten
hundred Ethernet like you need gigabit
on a printer and then you've got a USB b
connector for data if you do want to
hook it up directly to your computer
here you have that button but it's
basically the something went wrong but I
fixed it button so if you run out of
paper it'll probably flash some kind of
light you put in more paper press the
button it should resume printing if it
works like my printer at work does
instead oh here it has a lift handle
because it is quite heavy so if you are
going to lift this printer you should
lift it by the lift handle so I'm going
to go install it now thank you for
watching my unboxing of the CLP 310
color 310 n rather color laser printer
from Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
