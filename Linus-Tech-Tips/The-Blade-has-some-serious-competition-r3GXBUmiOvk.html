you to buy the corsair lap dog it lets
you use a full-sized mouse and
mechanical keyboard on the couch also
thank you to msi so first off at the
gigabyte suite i'm going to be checking
with the Auris x7 dt this laptop will be
looked into in much more detail by linus
in a little while so i'm not going to
cover it in its entirety but i do want
to cover some major changes that were
asked for by linus and a few other
people in the past one the keyboard is
no longer just orange backlighting it is
RGB backlighting and it has a wicked
amount of different modes in the
software don't pay too much attention
into the individual tones of the colors
whoever's because they are still
tweaking that the touchpad has also
changed is still glass but it appears
and feels quite a bit different the logo
is still going to be on it I know it
isn't on it here but it's still going
under some changes it'll be fine but it
is much more matte texture too not as
slippery which I think people will like
the screen has also changed the bezel
instead of coming to like a single thing
now has two one on each side of the
center point and the screen itself has
changed a little bit is still g-sync but
instead of being 4k it's now 1080p 120
Hertz with 5 milliseconds of delay so if
you're going for something like the
shooter games on your laptop that would
be quite ideal for the rest of the
details on the x7 DT tune into Linus's
video which will be back in the office
and more in depth later on for now let's
check out the arrow 14 the air 14 is
equipped with a 970 or 965 M NVIDIA GPU
and on the processor side you have a 6
generation i7 the one right here is a
6700 HQ so you can go pretty high-end
there as well in terms of memory you've
got 8 gigs or 16 gigs but it is
expandable there's 2 slots and you can
go up to 32 gigs the screen is a
beautiful 2560 by 1440 P IPS panel and
you have 2 m2 slot so I can go all the
way up to nvme that is up to 10 hours of
battery life in productivity mode and
even then only weighs 1.8 9 kilograms
with the battery installed for wireless
connectivity you have wireless AC and
Bluetooth 4.1 le for connectivity on the
right hand side you have USB 3.1 type-c
connector a mini DisplayPort connector
to USB 3.0 connectors and AC power in on
the left hand side you have an HDMI 2.0
port a USB 3.0
a headphone / microphone port an SD card
slot and the Kensington lock yes as you
may have noticed there is no Ethernet
port but that is actually fairly
standard these days and it's optional
but I think it's going to come with most
of them there's going to be a USB to
Ethernet adapter and then as you can
very obviously see beside me on the
table that I've been crouching next to
it comes in orange black and green
thanks again to Coursera for sponsoring
this episode if you like gaming on the
couch check out their lap dog it lets
you use something like a full-size
keyboard like their k70 or a full-size
mouse to game on the couch also thanks
to MSI they're showing off their new
aigis X desktop and their new GT X 1080
gaming x 8g we'll be checking those out
later on in the show so stay tuned for
that and stay subscribe to Linus tech
tips for all the rest of our Computex
