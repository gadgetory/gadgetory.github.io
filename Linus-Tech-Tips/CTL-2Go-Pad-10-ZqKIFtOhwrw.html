playing around with you to go pc tablet
and my overall impressions are that well
it's not perfect like it's definitely
not perfect I mean look okay compared to
you know what I'm considered like more
like the Cadillac of touchscreen devices
okay so here's the rotation feature on
my phone here's the rotation feature
need to go PC yeah it's not quite as
slick it's functional yes but the Polish
isn't quite there they've also got there
included easy bits quick menu thing here
which seems like the kind of thing that
would benefit a lot from an SSD as well
as a slightly more powerful GPU I keep
watching this ezza oh whoops yeah this
is a home network okay do that but go
away so when I try and browse this it's
not like it doesn't have that snappiness
to the GUI that something like an iOS
does wear when you're navigating around
things and you're looking at stuff you
know it just has that that feel to it
like it's all you know meant to work
that way you see that leg eNOS I think I
think a lot of that is accessing the
hard drive right now or when the overall
choppiness is probably GPU related um
you know what the keyboard is actually
not bad so you know here why don't we go
to so if I want to access the keyboard I
just do that and then I can okay that
was my fault i missed but okay so we'll
go to Google oh I missed again no that
was totally my fault i know i'm making
the touchscreen looking at here right
now but it's not okay so Google then I
close the keyboard it goes off to the
side as soon as I do this I can either
touch there or I can touch here to get
access to my keyboard again you know so
I could look for dogs with
hats for example and then I could easily
do my internet browsing on my little
tablet so i can scroll around now
zooming doesn't oh oh it does work I
look about okay I didn't even figure out
it worked before so you see zooming
isn't really perfect it's quite choppy
compared to once again we'll go back to
the iphone as an example of mazuma ng
should look like so I'm going from one
application to another one here here's a
good one exotic cats calm move on 3g
right now but you know here here's what
suming should look like you know here's
what zooming looks like on this tablet
that I accidentally minimized the window
so we want to see dogs with hats again I
kind of bit of a delay there okay so
it's not perfect yeah the GPU needs to
be a little bit more powerful blah blah
blah but watch this this is a flash
video this is me putting it in full
screen mode and this is me watching a
flash video do that on your iPhone or
your iPad thanks for watching don't
