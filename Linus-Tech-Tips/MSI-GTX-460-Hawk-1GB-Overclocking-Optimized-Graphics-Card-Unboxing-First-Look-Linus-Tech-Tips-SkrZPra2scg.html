that there's been quite a lot of buzz
about because of some screenshots that
have surfaced over the last few weeks
showing this GTX 460 running at 1
gigahertz on air with stock cooling
stable so there's been just a ton of
buzz about what makes this card so
special that it is able to achieve that
kind of overclock without any liquid
cooling or any any you know voltage mods
or other tricks so let's have a look at
what MSI has to say for themselves on
the inside of the box first of all
you've got triple over voltage support
so you can adjust the voltage of the GPU
memory and PLL just using MSI's
outstanding afterburner software next it
has a seven plus one phase pwm design so
that means it's capable of providing
loads more current up to 120 amps of
current then the reference GTX 460 which
uses a 4 + 1 @ phase PWM alright so
there's a couple things it has going for
it so obviously it uses a custom PCB
that's why it took so long to launch you
don't have to come in and out so much
you can just mostly look here for now
also it features emphasize military
class components I mean there's a whole
bunch of stuff in here that has to do
with it's cooler and more reliable but
to me the biggest advantage of military
class components is the fact that you
don't get coil whine coil whine sucks
it's loud so even if you have a quiet
fan it's like a little
noise when you're playing games it's
just stupid I hate it so any MSI cards
that I've used that feature military
class components I have not once
witnessed coil whine on them which is
terrific also you have V checkpoints
this is shown up on quite a few MSI
motherboards and their little built-in
points where you can connect your
multimeter and you can monitor the
voltages of the GPU memory and PLL using
an actual multimeter instead of relying
on only software now it does feature
twin froze or two thermal design so
means you got dual eighty millimeter PWM
fans you have a nickel plated copper
cooler it uses heat pipe direct touch
multiple heat pipes and a high-density
heatsink and the Cyclones up to 18
degrees cooler and 8.1 decibels quieter
than the reference cooler and that's all
while still achieving these outstanding
over clocks and all of these extra
voltage modification features it's just
this is this is a pretty cool ski I've
been really waiting for this one so here
we go the hawk itself it is over factory
overclocked although that's not really
even all that relevant for something
like this it comes with a couple of
molex to 6-pin PCI Express adapters here
are the little v check adapters so you
plug those into the into the card and
then you plug your multimeter into this
so you got three of those included I
guess they're gonna go ahead and assume
if you're buying a hawk Edition card
you've got a a DVI oh okay don't look at
that that's apparently a little note to
thank me for evaluating it it has passed
related testing
okay Oh neat I've never seen one of
these before okay accessories I found
more accessories there hiding there we
are
so it has adapters okay we have a DVI to
VGA adapter we have an mini HDMI to HDMI
adapter we have a driver DVD or CD throw
it away download the latest off the
Nvidia website we have a little Hawk
series brochure showing you how to use
MSI Live Update showing you where all
your V check points are showing you the
actual layout of the bare PCB card
that's kind of neat I've never seen that
before included with a video card a
little quick installation guide all good
things must come to an end including
that manual okay and then we have a
quick user's guide here as well now
let's look at the card itself because
this is the moment we have truly all
been waiting for I did mention it comes
factory overclocked it comes at 780
megahertz although that is not even
close to what msi claims right on the
box
you ought to be able to achieve with
this particular card it has I think I
mentioned already it has one gig of
memory ok and let's just take off the
little plastic covers that come on all
the connectors so that we can take a
closer look at the card itself so in
terms of layout you know what I wish I
had a regular GTX 460 to compare it
against right off the bat here because
it does look a little bit longer to me
but I can't actually tell without having
a direct comparison you can see on the
back of the PCB this is a black ish PCB
card it's got a little bit of brownness
to it but that doesn't really matter it
has an SLI connector up here on the top
it's got a PCI Express 16x connector
down here at the bottom the heatsink
attaches via four screws so it looks
like it would be quite easy to remove if
you did feel like putting on a a GPU
water block or anything like that let me
see what this is so this is the GPU V
switch
PWM clock tuner you know what they don't
mention that but those could be pretty
cool buttons depending what they do
alright let's move around to the front
of the part so you can see the dual
eighty millimeter fan Twin Frozr cooler
this is the same cooler except with with
nickel plated copper heat pipes and bass
and aluminum fins that we saw on the msi
geforce gtx 465 golden edition so it's
that same twin frozer design but this
one is copper and aluminum so that means
you see the same innovations carried
over the heat pipes that move further
away from the GPU or actually thicker so
that they can carry heat more
efficiently so that means that you're
able to make full use of the entire
cooler surface with these two fans and
I'm gonna look for those V checkpoints
here they are so you've got two PCIe six
pin connectors here and there are your
three v checkpoints where you can
monitor the voltage of your GPU memory
and help me and PLL using an actual
multimeter here on the back of the card
you've got vents in the back so okay
here here's how this heating is gonna
work some of the air from this fan is
going to be exhausted directly out of
the case but quite a bit of it is going
to be exhausted in your case so if you
want to get the best GPU temperature as
possible you want to make sure you have
good airflow throughout your case
okay so then we've got two DVI
connectors and one mini HDMI connector
remember you can only use two of these
at once and in order to get surround
surround support you have to have two of
these bad boys so then you'd plug in two
monitors here and then one on the third
card now does support CUDA 3d vision as
I mentioned GeForce surround if you have
two cards its supports 2-way SLI and all
the other usual Nvidia features physics
there's another one and thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first
look at the GeForce GTX 460 Hawk from
MSI</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
