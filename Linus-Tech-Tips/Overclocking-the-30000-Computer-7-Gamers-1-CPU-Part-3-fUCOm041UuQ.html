$30,000 computer running on raid as an
operating system and using it and some
really cool open-source virtualization
technology to run seven discrete gaming
virtual machines at once all fully
capable of like high performance gaming
so I was cool thirty thousand dollar
computer
two thumbs up very awesome ten @ @ n IG
and etc then what we did was we showed
it off at CES okay so we got that out of
the way the world was able to see it in
person then after that we brought it
back to the office converted our entire
conference room here into a LAN Center
and had an interoffice gaming
competition complete with taran being
terrible at video games yes the very
worst one here except he did kill me
once and you can check that video out
here so you might be asking yourself why
is line is still milking this damn thing
what could possibly be left to do and
the answer is of course we're going to
overclock it
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their core i7 6700 K and Core i5 6600 K
processors check out the link in the
video description to learn more
so the first step anytime you do any
performance tuning is to get a baseline
measurement because if you don't then
you have no idea if the dials you're
turning are doing anything at all so I'm
going to introduce you guys to the
benchmarks that we're going to be
running Cinebench r15 is going to tell
us what we need to know about cpu
performance we are going to be using
crystal disk mark to tell us what we
need to do about our SSD array
performance I 264 cache and memory
benchmark is going to be interesting
especially once we run it on all
machines at once more on that later and
we're going to be using fire strike
extreme to see how our GPUs are doing
some of the stuff that's open is just
temperature monitoring and stuff like
that and finally we're going to be
having a look using our handy dandy wall
power meter doodad here at what kind of
power consumption we see when we're
hitting the whole system at once but
let's start with a single VM baseline
with all the other ones sitting idle and
I'll show you guys on screen hopefully
right now how I plan to go through this
entire test suite and show you guys the
scores so here we go we're getting a
Cinebench score of around 600 we're
getting crystal disk mark scores in the
area of sort of you know two gigabytes
per second reads and around 400
megabytes per second writes to our array
our memory scores we're seeing about 5
gigabytes per second so on average reads
and writes to our quad-channel ddr4
memory and our 3d mark firestrike
extreme score is 61 48 so the next test
and this one I will need some helping
hands for is going to be to hit all
seven VMs at once for our baseline score
to see what happens when they have to
actually share resources which
especially for things like memory it's
not very pleasant sometimes
okay so I've assembled a crack squad of
helpers whose intelligence and physical
coordination I'll lead me to believe
that it is probable
nay likely to both kind of the same
thing that they will be able to perform
the skills that I set out for them today
tasks actually not skills don't worry
too much about that basically what you
guys have to do is all press a button at
the same time not gonna work
okay Colton you're fired again thank you
okay
so two of you will have to press two
buttons at once at the same time Johnny
you got this okay
Johnny you're on machines one and two
you've on you're on machine 3 Colton
you're here Nick you're here and I'll go
over there and I will tell you which
button to press and you will all press
it at the same time you're going to
click the button that says run next to
CPU in the Cinebench r15 programs
everyone got your cursor position ok so
I'm gonna say that don't do it yet I
guessed Aaron's not here I don't have to
give instructions like that ok 3 2 1 go
ok so you can see here with our seven
instances of Cinebench running we are
actually pinning the entire CPU here at
100% usage that was exactly our intent
and will tell us without any extra turbo
boost for only activating a couple of
cores at a time how all of our VMs can
run in a worst-case scenario where they
are sharing as much resources as
possible okay so we're scoring around
500 points which is about a hundred
lower than we did when we were just
running it on a single VM fascinating ok
everyone ready 3 2 1 go ok so this is
interesting on the read side of things
really there wasn't much of an effect
from the numbers I've looked at so far
but on the right side of things some of
our VMs were so starved for disk time
that they actually timed out on their
sequential write benchmark very very
interesting this isn't something we're
gonna retest after we overclocked
because we can't overclock storage but I
just wanted to have this as just a for
my information sort of number I 264
cache and memory benchmark it's a gray
window this one I'm really interested in
because desktops really don't care much
about their memory bandwidth the
today's I mean dual-channel quad channel
ddr3 ddr4 it's all fast enough but if
you're trying to hit something with
seven VMs at once I'm expecting the
performance to be affected somewhat it's
this is really interesting so you can
actually see the systems are running the
benchmarks at different speeds mix VM
over here so this is player number five
is actually still running the memory
benchmarks or at least it was before I
and mine is almost done running all of
the level 1 and level 2 cache benchmarks
so it does seem like their ability to
even run these tests is affected by the
fact that we're hitting them all at once
here we go last one position your cursor
over run three two one fire strike
extreme thank you clickable random times
like okay I guess that's it three to
load final exam okay you guys are
dismissed for now thank you I'll call
you back once I overclocked the system
so check this out this is what our
memory and cache benchmarking looked
like this is what our benchmarking looks
like in firestrike extreme so with seven
instances of it running you're actually
getting up near 100% utilization closer
to like 90 here
okay very interesting so 3dmark scores
not affected much by our cpu and ram
sharing because 3d bark is mostly
dependent on the graphics card in each
VM has its own r9 nano so all this left
now to do is to record our scores so we
can create some average score graphs for
you guys and establish our baseline so
that we can find out if our overclocking
helps
now most server motherboard makers do
not have any overclocking features but
this is a soos and this is technically
AWS or workstation board so in the AI
Tweaker menu we've got there AI
overclocked tuner which has two settings
neither of which I have played with at
all manual and OC tune so I'm just going
to go let's OC tune it level three and
find out if the system works there's a
very good chance it's not going to work
I have not tested this at all
so this is actually a really bizarre
quirk of this system it starts up here
oh if it turns on at all it starts up
here oh wow yep that's not posting let's
clear seamless and then we will go from
there
let's see if that does anything oh that
was it I need this bar to get past like
me here
well that wasn't it
like I
I know what it is because we did ASIMO's
clear that bio setting that I need the
4G decoding setting is not enabled so we
are not able to boot with all of these
PCI devices so maybe by unplugging all
the video cards I will be able to have
them not get picked up and I will be
able to get into the bios this is how
you remove the graphics cards from seven
gamers one CPU there we go okay they're
out so now can try again
okay so that was it a problem with
having a system that doesn't post in its
default configuration okay so let's try
manual this time um my understanding is
that on these types of boards you can
expect somewhere in the neighborhood of
like a hundred and five megahertz so
just for lulz let's try 105 and see what
happens I'm guessing not a whole lot and
that's what I got okay then okay so
after four attempts we're back in the
BIOS are setting did stick but obviously
didn't work so let's try a more
conservative 103 which would be a three
percent overclock okay so because we
have no video card we have to use VNC to
get into our VM and find out if
everything is working as intended well
that is not reporting correctly at all
so that's a pain so we're gonna have to
run a benchmark and find out okay I tell
you
vm's really screw up hardware reporting
both cpu-z
and i 264 are reporting numbers that
would indicate that our CPU is not
overclocked but Cinebench is reporting
that it is overclocked and even though
these scores are not directly comparable
because we don't even have any of the
other VM booted we're getting 900 in
Cinebench
which would indicate that everything's
working properly at the very least so
now we can proceed to the next step and
put our graphics cards back in okay all
our video cards are showing up which
basically means we can start the array
and fire up our VMs did it just do that
or did you do that Hey all right so now
it is time to overclock our video cards
now the r9 nano isn't really known to be
much of an overclocker oh but we're
gonna go ahead and increase the power
limit as high as it goes and we're gonna
increase our clock tonight I don't know
1050 and see what happens
hey graphics 1050 megahertz
just like that I guess water cooling
helps a little bit with the whole
overclocking Murai nano situation very
nice
he'll afterburner is detecting all seven
GPUs that shouldn't be possible because
we've passed them through two separate
PM's it's also detecting Wow afterburner
doesn't know what's going on so it's got
them all being used while we're running
the benchmark so it knows they're seven
but it doesn't know that it's only using
one of them and it's just cloning this
core clock graph which actually has the
card not reaching uh not reaching a
thousand megahertz anyway so I guess all
that's left now then is to run some
benchmarks and find out if we got any
benefit for our trouble everyone ready
overclock Cinebench benchmark what damn
it Nick I've wanted someone to just
start the benchmark early out of that
stared out please work
no no what that's good huh player
whatever it is so it's one two three
four five six seven and then you put OC
scores Cinebench what my keyword says
don't worry about that okay actually
that does seem to be faster yeah forty
points better on my everyone ready three
two one run it
please don't crash why it's okay give it
time
power draw 1600 watts so did everything
but next lunch okay so after much
struggling we managed to achieve
whopping over clocks of anywhere from 0
to 70 megahertz on our graphics cards
yielding fire strike extreme scores in
the very very close to what we were
already getting range leading us to
believe that this whole thing was a
terrible idea but I'm really glad that
you guys got to come along for the
adventure with us because that is what
we do on this channel that is what we do
this is a sponsor spot I have been
looking forward to for quite some time
we recovered a take on what they do is
pretty obvious they recover data and why
we're affiliated with them will be
pretty obvious if you checked out the
data recovery vlog which if you haven't
already is a pretty a pretty exciting
piece of content as far as they go on
this channel anyway they gave me some
bullet points to talk about and I will
do that but then I'll get into why
they're so special to me so first of all
they're one of the only data recovery
companies to invest in R&amp;amp;D so if the
technology to recover your data doesn't
exist they create it they're fast
they're tech savvy they have friendly
customer service available 24/7 and that
was indeed my experience their data
recovery guarantee policy means that if
they don't recover any data there is no
recovery fee they have worldwide
emergency data response options
including on-site remote and in lab
that's 24/7 365
they've got state-of-the-art equipment
utilizing today's most advanced
technology with proprietary in-house
developed tools they've got ISO for
class 10 and ISO 5 class 100 clean rooms
to enable them to provide a optimum
solution for a recovery environment and
basically what it boils down to for me
is they got my data back it was an
extremely complicated raid array not
recommended rate array so I had three
raid fives that were hardware raid fives
on separate LSI controllers and then I
had those striped together and raid zero
for an effective raid 50 so three raid
five stripes in Windows I thought it
should be pretty safe because I can lose
up to one SSD per controller before I
should run into any issues but what I
didn't account for is losing a
controller outright so one of the
controllers failed causing the array to
go into an unrecoverable state and we
recover datacom had me plug in all those
24 drives to a host bus adapter and they
were able to remotely using their own
Linux tool reconstruct the whole thing
allow me to copy it off and basically
save my turkey which thanks to those
guys and if you guys have a data
recovery emergency then check them out
