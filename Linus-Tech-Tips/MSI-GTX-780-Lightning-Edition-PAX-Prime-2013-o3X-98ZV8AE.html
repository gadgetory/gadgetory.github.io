brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries the star of the show
here at the MSI booth is of course the
GTX 780 lightning this is their first
non-reference gtx 780 fully
non-reference we're talking completely
redesigned cooling completely redesigned
PCB completely redesigned freaking
everything so the PCB is actually not
only larger than a normal gtx 780 but
they've got their GPU reactor on the
back of it which can provide better
voltage stability during extreme
overclocking they've got a dual BIOS
mode for the card that has got an ln to
optimized or liquid nitrogen optimized
mode or a normal mode depending on how
you're going to be using the card
they've completely redesigned even the
concept of their cooler so all dem
military class components are covered by
a back plate on the back a unison con
the front and then three fans instead of
two fans like you'd normally find on
their traditional twin frozer so that's
I guess they could call that like a like
a try frozer or something like that
they're still using their propeller
blade fans and they have their dust
removal technology meaning the fans spin
backwards on startup so that you don't
get dust and gunk all built up into the
heatsink it's got eight super pipes
which is Emma sighs branding for
basically larger than normal heat pipes
that are able to carry heat away from
the heat generating components more
effectively than regular pipes and of
course you've got all of the usual and
video technology so support for three
monitors and nvidia 3d vision surround
with an auxiliary monitor support for
nestle I up to four way although three
ways really the highest that we normally
recommend or two way for people who are
more concerned with performance per
dollar it needs to eight pin PCI Express
plugs and while I don't have the details
on what it's clocked at by default I
think we can all agree that whatever
it's clocked at with the cooling
solution that you've got on here it's
going to be running at that speed all
the time because GPU boosts two point O
depends on keeping the card cool in
order to get the best performance guys
don't miss any of our packs coverage
remember our trip to the show is powered
