right now okay I have had a fairly
terrible last couple of days I have been
fighting with my my tape drive backup
thing that basically doesn't work on the
PC properly and the guys that make it
are like yeah the truth of the matter is
that the driver situation from IBM on
down just isn't that great on the PC and
it works better on a Mac so then I've
been trying to get a Mac working with
ten gigabit and so I was using the
MacBook Pro and thank you to it land to
be clear so I was using the MacBook Pro
and I ran into the road remember when I
called you earlier this week yeah asking
if you had the core X yeah yeah so I
thought so I managed to have three
external PCI Express docks for ten
gigabit network cards a variety of
cables and I still couldn't manage to
get like I even got down to the point
where I had a thunderbolt chipset that
Apple hadn't specifically locked out
because we don't support it yeah I
managed to find one that didn't have a
thunderbolt chip that was locked out so
the enclosure worked on the Mac and I
even managed to get a 10 gig Ethernet
card with the exact same chipset that is
already in use in the iMac Pro but that
still doesn't work because there's some
stupid beta of Mac OS that you have to
like update from an older one too and
then it will flash cards that are not
like Mac approved to be Mac approved and
then and then they just work because
because the drivers are for the hardware
not for like the stupid vendor ID that
actually doesn't matter but with Apple
it's just anthony's way of putting it I
think is great it's magic numbers it's
not about whether it should actually
work or not it's about making sure it
has the right magic number that's
actually one of his theories about the
the whole throttling issue with the
MacBook Pro did you see this you hear
about this the big thermal throttle I
know yeah yeah yeah an Apple fixes it
with an O a Mac OS update that they said
was firmware but doesn't seem to be
firmware because it doesn't fix it in
Windows yeah so so it must just be like
a mad
number like a magic magic number detects
the CPU correctly now no it doesn't
behave stupidly oh good yeah yeah
thank goodness for a genuine Apple
approved hardware and nothing else
working at all don't hear my great story
and then and then I've spent the last
four hours dealing with this do you
think is gonna be done by the end of
Wayne I hope so it's at 84% and it was
that by 54 when I heard now so I think
we're I think we're getting close I'm a
duck out of when and just finish this is
the last thing I'm waiting for I just
want to run Cinebench sorry sorry
everyone I'm just I'm having a rough day
I just want to run Cinebench and I can't
if Windows Update is sucking back 25% of
the CPU in the background right I just
want to know how much faster it is in
last gen and I was thinking maybe I'd
compare it to the surface go since that
arrived today tried to livestream the
surface go turns out another video
project were working on which is really
cool by the way basically we're given
the we're given the this to Google oh
but in a way that's like not just to
spite them it's just we are abusing
their services oh yeah I know in a way
that's really cool well it turns out
we're also abusing voice within the
terms abusing the CPU of our router yeah
so it looks like that killed our stream
earlier we were we literally Oh like
overloaded our router CPU and remember
this is not some this isn't some wimpy
BS rack-mounted road this isn't this is
an edge router pro from ubiquity oh it's
not some hundred thousand dollars stupid
or like Cisco thing or anything like
that but it is not an insubstantial
piece of networking machinery I love
this I love this you sit and wait for
hours for it and then it's got this
friendly hang just hold on for a sec you
got some updates for your PC no no you
had updates for my PC four hours ago
minutes yeah at this point what Dennis
don't hear my story I need you here from
my story so I want to get up we're done
this we do the intro first sure okay
let's just do whatever there's tech news
or some stuff next-gen and
roadmap leaks also Google oh my goodness
engine there's rumors about the trillion
dollars boom crazy
I'm hating on
later
Oh cuz you've got Linux fanboys in the
mix - no that's FreeBSD yeah whatever
um actually anyways okay so remember at
the end of last stream how I revealed
how I finally bought a new chair yeah uh
what now so so the story of my chair is
someone sat on the arm and it broke the
like middle support so basically my
chair was tilted like this for four
years in defense of your chair that
someone was very likely to break that
chair yes yep yep in fairness to your
chair yep
I mean but to like to compensate so I
was looking straight at my monitor I
basically sat like this for four years
and then recently went to physio and he
was like wow you need a new chair you're
an idiot
so I did a whole bunch of research took
like a month over a month for the chair
to show up it's supposed to like keep
you in a specific spot so that your
spine is like correctly aligned it's not
supposed to be super comfortable it's
supposed to keep you in the right spot
right it's kind of like a racing chair
except not for a car so it actually
makes sense for going fast on your
computer yeah anyways the XP ends up the
expected delivery date was August 6 you
might noticed it is not that day yet I
have had the chair for a while on I
believe the 31st of the 30th I don't
remember if it was this Monday or this
Tuesday I would get some lunch I had
finished a relatively major milestone
you know I was like you know what I'm
gonna I'm gonna reward myself with a
booster juice so I decided to go outside
and get some boosters as I'm working at
cost as much as a meal but then you have
to pay $4 yeah but I was like yeah I'm
good I was it was very happy like I go I
go I go walk outside as I'm walking
outside I was like whoa there's a giant
cardboard box in the lawn that's weird
and I just keep
walking and then I'm like I should
probably like bring that inside just in
case it's like my upstairs neighbors and
I go and I look at it closer and I see
Herman Miller plastered on the side of
it and I'm like what they just left it
on the lawn they just left it on the
lawn no notification text message no
notification email I had no idea I still
have no idea how long it was sitting
there when I moved it there was very
much an impression in the grass so it
had been sitting there for a while
possibly all night because sometimes I
don't leave my house for a while
so I have no clue how long it was there
super-expensive chair big logo on the
side of the box just left in the front
lawn for who knows how long no
notification that was there nothing they
didn't knock they didn't even notice
they didn't nothing happened so I'm
immediately pissed off I bring it inside
I go get my food I come back I go to
open it first of all there's like it's
the worst cardboard box as the outer
shell that I've like ever seen and
there's there's like rips where the
handles were because the guys handling
it and like I don't even blame them
because if you try to pick up it just
rips it's just a terrible cardboard box
right but I'm thinking in my head like
oh it's there'll be an internal carton
right no big deal I open that up nope
not only is there no internal carton
that is literally the entire box for the
chair
there's also zero packing foam or
protection of any form at all in the
entire box so it's just the chair just
sitting rattle I was able to turn it
around while it was inside the box just
cuz I wanted to kind of try it out and
see how it goes like it was actually the
worst unboxing experience that I have
ever had that same day I like opened up
a box for a mouse and was like wow this
is a way better experience than the
ludicrously obscenely illogically
expensive chair that I just bought I was
so mad it's fine it like creaks when you
move around it's mostly made out of
plastic like it's it's really like that
the ergonomic chair market is insane
like it's if we want to open another
business we should just make organ Amma
chairs because you can just charged a
billion percent on what it costs to make
it yeah and everyone's just clamoring
all over you because
they're all generally terrible it also
doesn't really feel that great like it's
it's okay right but it's not that's what
yeah okay so yes that seems like a
really smart sale oh it's arms really in
sales pitch it doesn't have to feel good
it's ergonomic so it holds me in a
relatively good position so I'm probably
gonna end up keeping it because it'll be
good for my spine okay sounds good
the doctor dude says I like really need
to do something about that because my
spine is getting all weird because I sit
like this all the time so yeah sounds
good okay
yeah like nurse so okay I'm probably
gonna keep it except like the the base
isn't foam which is kind of cool because
it's breathable but they use these
plastic he spring things and that's
great in most areas except for where the
reinforced bar is right and you can like
super feel this bar but it's just under
you all the time have you tried the om5
is this the we had to like an orange ey
yeah we did a review of it so my problem
with that was it didn't lock the new one
locks well I might try that I can return
my chair oh you know what you should
come over maybe come over in oh holy
crap they have me quoted on their
website I should make sure what they're
saying isn't like Linus of Linus tech
tips says the om5 is the most
comfortable chair they probably could
have put some context around that I'm
sure I did let's have a look did they
link right to the time stamp don't think
so I bet they do I bet they do no oh no
all right well thanks for that guys yeah
I'm sure I probably said that I've tried
so let's turn it in what box-and-one
said in the chat sorry to cut you off I
actually thought about this if I
returned the chair I'm wondering like
like if it shows up damaged is it my
fault I have all of the original
packaging because it's a box so like
there's really not a lot going on there
like I but like who gets in trouble if
the chairs damaged when it when it shows
up anyway you should you should try wait
Oh actually I know I don't know if the
whole thing locks but the arm the arm
rests lock like there's stuff baby my
problem was if I sat back at all yeah I
would just fall backwards so yvonne has
new ones it has one of the new ones okay
so you give it a shot just to make sure
because I'll try one of my big
problems with buying these ludicrously
expensive chairs yeah as well this one's
not that bad it's 450 bucks that's
wavering is like you can't generally try
them anywhere yeah if you're in like LA
you can often go to a studio area and
try them out but like I get so I had to
go off of like a whole bunch at just
like and buying anything like clothing
clothing or economic based food or
chairs like stuff that has a personal
taste but yeah personalization element
to it online is really tough space yeah
like Yvonne ordered some flip-flops off
Amazon and she just like Bieber cheaper
than buying in store so that's cool so
she ordered two of them yeah
just assuming that one of them would be
a horrible fit because because that's
just the way it works and until we can
until we can 3d scan our site and submit
that model off to something to make sure
something's gonna fit for us there's
nothing we can really do but I mean I'm
actually perfectly fine with them having
that quote on there cuz it's still the
most comfortable chair that I have and
that I have tried I really like it so I
don't know yeah I and like see people
are people are recommending stuff in
here the problem is that it doesn't it
doesn't mean anything to me cuz I can't
try it yeah the only reason that I'm
even bringing it up is because I have
the newest one at my house and you can
come try it and like the only reason why
I got the chair that I have now is
because marques has it yeah Frank has it
and I tried it at seven aces streaming
area because it's his chair so I don't
want this to come across wrong but I
wouldn't necessarily buy something
because like let's just pick one of them
let's say because marques well know by
surfboard that's not because it's a good
surfboard because he's like he's a very
like he's he's very on point with like
what the coolest thing the last point
was the important one was so this has
the same chair and I sat in it for a
while right it was like okay this is
holding me in the right spot and that's
the same reason why he has it he's a
tall dude I believe he's slightly taller
than I am and it can hold his spine in
place
all right so sorry to hear that anyway
that was just yeah it was horrible it
was weird because I opened opened a
Logitech mouse yeah and a herb and
Miller chair right and I expected like I
expected the Logitech mouse unboxing
experience to be quite good it exceeded
expectations I expected the Herman
Miller chair unboxing to be way too much
and for me to be like this is dumb I
wish they didn't do so much packaging
because I could have saved some money
and then it was like wow I literally
don't think they could have gotten it to
me if I saved any amount of money on the
packaging because it wouldn't have made
it or it would have been like some dude
just like handing me the chair because
he had to like walk it from the front
rolling it yeah yeah I'm so so so
annoyed give it some time and maybe
Logitech will just acquire Herman Miller
and then you won't have to worry about
it just ladies our first topic blue yeah
Logitech has acquired microphone brand
blue but don't be blue I don't know you
might want to be blue about it and
honestly there's not gonna be much in
terms of changes as far as we can tell
from Logitech blog post anyway so well
okay I will also give them the benefit
of the doubt in the way that they have
not made very noticeable very large
scale alterations to any other companies
of it yeah like ultimately yours oh hold
on a second
there have been there's been some
frustration with harmony harmony harmony
remotes yeah oh that's all though isn't
it yeah but that doesn't mean that
people didn't get kind of oh no I hear
you but they might have learned from we
can hope they haven't made it as far as
we can tell they haven't made a lot of
changes to Ultimate Ears
it seems like this is kind of the thing
right now though is your your Corsairs
your razors and your Logitech's of the
world are just scooping up any brand
that kind of matters in the peripheral
space like I think we are we're so we're
we're on this weird trajectory right now
we're over the last I'd say five
so going back maybe a year or two years
ago and then five years before that we
saw this incredible burst in
diversification in the peripheral space
yeah so we went from you know like every
single person was making some form of
keyboard like mechanical keyboards are a
great example you had what like Philco
ducky I mean do you remember when Das
Keyboard mattered leopold yeah so you
had a handful of guys making mechanical
keyboards and then you had and there was
something more traditional brands that
dabbled like steel series had one
mechanical there - okay the 60 and the
7g and then all of a sudden you walked
around a show like CES or Computex and
you could find literally 50 brands josh
is still relevant to you oh I like to
ask people remember relevant is our is
is a they're still relevant but they're
not mainstream yeah they can be as
relevant as they want to a vary from all
number of people yeah but when you look
at the definition of the word relevant
it's it's relative oh so so they were
more relevant before yeah they were in
relative terms much more relevant than
they are now when you've got brands like
Corsair who you know for whom the the
the monthly sales of someone like Das
Keyboard would be a rounding error like
that would be that that would be the
samples they send out to to media when
they launch a new keyboard to make sure
that everyone and their dog has tried
the latest and greatest Corsair and
hopefully it's it's sitting in in places
yeah exactly
so so there's just there's this sort of
relativity to to relevant this relevant
Ness relevant 'ti I don't know I'm
trying which brings us to our first
sponsor for the show today I mean it was
just such a perfect segue I kind of had
to do it okay Corsairs strafe mark -
keyboard which you can learn more about
at the link right there it's a
mechanical RGB cube
Gordon is an update from the previous
fan favorite strafe now with all the
features you've been asking for well not
all the features you've been asking for
a few as me because I'm a big fan of
Cherry MX browns but it comes in either
Cherry MX red or Cherry MX silent
switches with the Reds offerings linear
smooth actuation while the silence
dampened sound by 30% which is great for
users who stream that's actually a big
deal keyboard noise so Cherry MX silent
definitely recommended for that it's got
a hundred percent Andy coasting with 104
Q rollover meaning even if you type with
your face all of your keystrokes will be
registered thank you Luke for that
demonstration it's got eight Meg's of
built-in storage to allow you to take
all your RGB configurations and macro
customization with you anywhere you go
and the top of the keyboard has a
built-in USB pass-through which I
actually love that's a great feature
that kind of disappeared for a bit in
the keyboard world and then is is back
now apparently which is terrific so
check it out at Corsair comm or the link
in the video description
oh I said the link was there but it's
not it will be it will be below the
video of Corsair comms that's okay

shall we do some tech news news about
tech sure next gen NVIDIA GTX the name
has apparently been settled
dun-dun-duh go ahead and share my screen
well I'm so surprised it'll be twenty
eighty and twenty seventy that's kind of
stupid I was expecting eleven eighty and
1170 we're gonna win the day
but I guess Nvidia is kind of going well
the rate at which we release new
generations of graphics cards has
significantly slowed down so in order
for us to keep having numbers go up at a
nice you know nice good take here we're
gonna have to chill out on the just
increasing the second digit kind of
thing yeah I think they're going with
like if you if you increase the first
digit instead of this where are we
reading from digit so we had two seven
eighty and then we skipped 800 series
because I don't know it's unlucky or
something who knows and then we had the
nine series and then we had the ten
series and now we get the twenty so when
we so when we go 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 do
we get the 100 series yes but then do we
get the 200 series and then are we back
to the 200 series that's gonna be
confusing so Anna
like 20 years or so Nvidia is gonna have
to watch out for that train coming down
the tracks pretty slowly and won't
happen for a while but that could happen
eventually well cuz we had a 200 series
already but that was a digit 200 series
this would be the 200 and 280 series the
2,000 gtx 2080 you think they might just
end up almost dumping that version and
go like GTX like alpha one
oh no Mike alpha two or they could go
straight to 300 because we never had a
300 series anyway manly technologies and
Nvidia 800 series was used in like
mobile and stuff yes
like om only or some manly technologies
a vendor for NVIDIA GeForce GPU is just
registered an ECC certificate with the
name GTX 2070 and 2080 included in the
mix the GPU chips also contain G a 104
and G a 104 400 both of which should be
ampere based going by the code name so
if you guys I don't know if you guys
ever noticed this but the second letter
of an NVIDIA code name is the
architecture so GP would be g4s Pascal
and then GF would be geforce Fermi so G
a should be geforce and peer 104 means
that once again we are getting not a big
chip yeah so 102 or 100 will be big
chips I forget how it works what's the
thing when when they had to spin it
twice I can't remember what was what was
580 GTX 580 you had to spin it twice
yeah so GF 110 ah crap a camera I can't
remember I can't remember but there's
there's one aspect of a code name that
tells you if they had to if the first
run was good enough or if they had just
vinegar oh it's not it's not terribly
important
so it's a real certification but it is
also still possible that the companies
using placeholder names in the actual
nomenclature is something else although
we are so close to when it is rumored to
be announced at Gamescom which starts on
August 21st that it is hard to imagine
that they're planning to do a switcheroo
at the last minute I'm with that said I
have seen packaging on NVIDIA cards come
in with like stickers over top of old
names and sometimes Nvidia will will go
so far to throw the industry for a loop
that they will legitimately charge their
customers so not like you the end-user
but customers like EVGA they will
literally charge their customers one
price and then the day of the launch
announced that it's a completely
different price and just issue a rebate
after the fact they have actually done
that yeah so those guys are like I
actually I mean I've said this to enough
people at Nvidia's faces that I don't
feel like I'm talking behind their back
but enough with the cloak-and-dagger
bullcrap you guys just just just just
release them release the product okay
just just chill it's just a graphics
card on boys like this is not no - we're
sending people to the moon
no Mars Titan okay you do the next topic
I think I'm not even I'm not gonna give
you the satisfaction gosh there's a
super long topic about a UK committee
trying to battle fake news that I don't
even want to talk about it oh boy
battling fake means a levy on social
media Wow
so this is kind of like via do you
remember that law we're gonna talk okay
let's do it well I was gonna talk about
the levy on blank CD's that we have here
in Canada what you don't know about this
no yeah when you buy a blank CD it comes
with like I don't know it's like a
couple cents or something like that but
basically it's steal that fund it's to
fund pyres funding by Canadian
government yard
oh my god yeah I know it's -
theoretically - to fund anti-piracy
measures or reimburse organizations that
lost money due to piracy or whatever
interesting because obviously you know
iTunes and Spotify weren't a better
long-term solution than charging a levy
on blank CDs so so what they're
proposing is a principle based is print
sorry principle based recommendations
designed to be sufficiently adaptive to
deal with fast-moving technological
defensible based recommendations from
the government literally buzzwords what
so it's a levy on social media and tech
giants to fund expanding a major
investment in the UK's data watchdog so
the body is able to attract an employee
more technically field engineers who can
analyze current technologies and have
the capacity to predict future
technologies okay
I mean so it's not like there aren't
precedents for this this is similar to
the way in which the banking sector pays
for the upkeep of the financial conduct
authority there's a code for advertising
through social media during election
periods limits to the most amount of
money an individual can donate and a
major increase in the maximum fine blah
blah blah blah blah blah okay so yeah
there's gonna be some interesting laws
over the next little bit sorry throw up
a little numb out there yeah and I was
trying to hold it in so that the poor
headphone users at home didn't have to
have burp sound like I mean they ended
up with it was like really I didn't
expect it to be so loud yeah it was very
it was as unpleasant to feel accounts
for you can't reproduce it yeah
Intel had some roadmap leaps which
ironically are over on video cards calm
until doesn't make video cards at least
not yet maybe that'll be their new for a
it is the Herod Roger cannery well okay
you just got rekt no no yeah okay hold
on dedicated colors the red it's not a
card is that it is candy Oh actually
yeah
I was just having some fun with him
they're actually making a physical like
PCIe card that's the plan yeah this is a
word on the street okay like it's not on
a road map anyways I knew I knew they
brought him on to help with the like oh
we're gonna have your like AMD or sorry
the Radeon group technology on CPU and
we want like whoa no yeah no I think
that I think that collaboration between
Intel and Radeon technologies might if
anything be more strained yeah we're
like I don't think AMD was super
thrilled about Raja alright do wonder
how much a Raja Kaduri costs like if I
wanted to hire Raja like how would that
even how would that even work like how
do you poach a guy like that and I
wonder Worley industry legend yeah yeah
yeah and I wonder what kind of like
benefit style stuff you'd have to bundle
in yeah you'd probably he'd probably
have to like he'd probably have to have
like you know like in it because you
can't just be money like it'd have to be
like in in like dogs you know they're
like well no I don't know like there
have to be some kind of like additional
benefit like you'd have to have like a
like a guaranteed like a staff like
you're gonna have two personal
assistants and this and that so it's
like it's more than just money you'll
have access to the the executive jet
from time periods x to y you'll have
this much sabbatical every two years and
like like that kind of thing like I I
would be really good stuff because
beyond a certain point not everyone but
a lot of people will stop caring at
least as much about money yeah and it
will take astronomically more to make it
really worth their while yeah so you
want to start putting in other stuff
yeah you have to start building like a
benefits package I've actually spent
very little time with people who I would
consider to be like real executives but
some I did spend some time with the
executive assistant of an executive at a
very large tech company a little while
ago I was I was at a dinner and I ended
up at the table with like kind of the
like the assistants and stuff yeah and
honestly the Congress
there was far more interesting than what
I would have gotten sitting with the
executives I think because it's all the
like but like scuttlebutt so there they
have rules like how often the executive
assistant has to swap out and that
position is considered like a really
tough position because you actually end
up doing like a lot of the executives
actual work but it's considered a
stepping stone because you just have all
this access to other executives yeah so
you get your name out there you get your
name out there and so they swap like
between balls everywhere you just only
you have like six months to like make
your mark it's more than that I think
it's like two years or something like
that but then you have to hire a new one
and then that person goes on to it
because remember that a lot of a lot of
large companies have policies and
programs in place where people can
change jobs quite frequently within the
company and it's a that's encouraged
yeah
just so that people won't stagnate but
so that they can retain their best
talent see my strategy for that is to
force people to work on things that they
don't want to work on so that when
they're done that they get to go back to
working on something that they want to
work on and they can be excited to go to
work just to go back to their regular
job thanks guys sorry AJ almost done
dude in other news here's that leak we
were talking about so apparently there's
some kind of new is he in chat oh that
doesn't work Luke he told me it did is
he lying to me because I'd love to know
watching for watching for AJ keep
misleading me oh boy does flow play and
even exist do you even work for us that
meanwhile meanwhile Luke's just been
siphoning all the money yep and AJ's
like what there was money flow plane
what's that
alright so ok ok this is this roadmap so
apparently in 2018 we are
a 9700 K okay according to the roadmap
leak and then sometime in q3 of 2018
there's gonna be something called a 9900
K which is gonna be higher end than the
existing core I nines or something
someone in Chad said siphoning money to
afford your chair technically I saved
for four and a half years yeah by that
she'd look at it that way yeah
technically I've saved for ten years to
replace my car so I should just run out
and buy a Model X then right oh boy
by that logic oh this one was like
highly recommended you know it's really
funny is I gonna return it I'm supposed
to be shopping for cars yeah as I have
made a commitment okay I was gonna say
when I drove up today like when it was
pink and stuff it was pretty bad you got
the dick buck dick butt on the mirror or
the on the back window is pretty bad
it's like it's like a different level it
actually looks like it has a disease I'm
actually tired of it now like it's the
only car that I know of that I've ever
looked at that I'm like that is
problematic like it's not even funny
no it's just a nice heart it's too far I
haven't been pulled over yet a binge of
daily driving it okay you know what
let's get through these leagues first so
the 28 core part that Intel teased back
at Computex is apparently gonna be a
brand new market segment with a
different chipset in socket I mean
anyone who knows anything would have
known that 3647 socket and then probably
some kind of cut-down version of their
c6 20 whatever chipsets there's gonna be
a basin Falls refresh November 2018 okay
glacier falls but in production later
blah blah blah blah blah okay so back to
the car so I have made a commitment to
my wife that I will replace it by the
time the next service period rolls
around wins the mixer now I committed to
that because my intention was to sort of
just keep driving it yeah
because there's gonna be an it was
another 8,000 kilometers it's about
5,000 miles left before it needed to be
serviced again
but I'm starting to come around to
getting on that a little earlier but the
stupid thing is that honestly I look I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna lie to you guys
I can afford a new car yeah obviously we
you know like it and I don't even mean
like brand new car like I can afford to
replace that car with something better
than that car probably most of you
watching could afford to replace that
car with something better than that car
you could buy something for five hundred
bucks and it would probably be better
than that okay shut up
be nice to my car it has served me well
no no no I look it has I'm allowed to
talk I'm allowed to speak bad we thought
it we're not we thought it was gonna do
haven't earned it we we we thought it
was gonna die in 2013 yeah we were
surprised it was still alive in 2013 so
so anyway so so I getting pretty tired
of it but my original plan was to just
keep driving it until that service and
then figure she'd probably have gotten
used to it by then and then just keep
driving it but she's not getting used to
it I'm not getting used to it when you
get your new car yeah
[Laughter]
remember how we use our I probably used
to have all those ideas of like getting
a computer in the trunk and having like
screens on the back of the seats yes
I've wanted to do that with the minivan
for a while the issue is we can't find a
sponsor oh yeah because we don't have
the expertise to like completely rework
the interior of a car to do it properly
yeah and so we'd want to work we want to
collaborate with like a shop that's
capable of that like doing a good job of
it and so there just be costs associated
and since it's not the kind of thing
that actually has much practical use
it's not the kind of thing I just want
to pay for in a pocket because it you
could actually do wireless for most of
it yeah like pretty much all of it but
power and mounting the monitors yeah
like I wouldn't want it to be janky so
there there are some possibilities and I
don't want to get too far into it but we
have some ideas okay
but what are you leaning towards a car
at all so that's the thing is I'm
supposed to be car shopping because I
have a greed butcher and I want to I
ended up spending probably a grand total
of about 40 minutes car shopping okay
and since then all I've been researching
is motorcycles there are some super cool
electric motorcycles so I've never
really had any desire I know I know
I know shut up I never had any desire to
replace my sv650 s it's a 2003 but
that's the first year that it had fuel
injection okay question is I sidebar
question does that baby be a good bike
ah no it doesn't cuz that like wasn't a
thing that blew my mind that's
apparently a newer thing on bikes ABS
yeah yeah yeah weird so yeah I know my
bike doesn't have EVs it's pretty
bare-bones but it's got the v-twin
engine which I really like it's got lots
of pull in the low rpm range it's it's
actually especially now that I'm more
used to it it's really light like it's
not light compared to a dual sport or
something but it's but it's it's it's
light its maneuverable and it's honestly
got enough power that unless you're an
idiot you don't really need more than
that like if you're doing anything other
than going in a straight line there's
not much reason to have much more power
than that at least on the road like on
the track the whole different story
whatever talk about your favorite track
bike amongst yourselves please but
there's there's there's this bike called
the lightning that zero-to-sixty
gonna roast me about a chair the artist
was like recommended by a
physiotherapist because my back has
problems and you want to replace your
car with a bike and you already have a
perfectly good bike zero to 60 in two
seconds how do you stay on
oh my goodness is this here so is this
your midlife crises the funny thing
about it is I've always joked with my
wife like that
I couldn't possibly have a midlife
crisis because I've been midlife crisis
in my whole life so so the thing that
the thing about bikes is that they're
cheap and bite you you're good I don't
mean that $40,000 isn't a lot of money I
mean that for literally the fastest bike
on the planet compared to literally the
fastest car on the planet but we're
talking in order of magnitude difference
in price yeah so for the price of like a
basic minivan which I recently purchased
you could have the fastest bike on the
planet zero to 60 in two seconds but you
can't even use it oh you can accelerate
electric motors dangerous take off if
your wheel spin I'd love to learn to do
a wheelie that's also and the 650 yeah
but on those on the road it's legal to
do it elsewhere they have like they have
like stunt riding courses and stuff like
I'd be a lot of fun shot yeah anyway
anyway so I'm supposed to be shopping
for a car I have actually spent the vast
majority of my time shopping for a bike
now with that said so would you sell
yours range on the lightning I think is
like 150 200 miles also someone of the
someone in the chat had a question what
is the mileage or kilometers on your
Lambo on the Lambo it's about 200 it's a
little over two hundred and twenty
thousand is just the wrong thing yeah a
little over two hundred twenty thousand
kilometers there you go what the crap is
this you know what's great is the mobile
version has
the mobile version of Chrome has a thing
where when you're stuck in one of these
back loops where it just keeps reloading
like it forwards you a few times so you
can't spam click back to get back yeah
on the mobile version you can tell it
don't let this page bring up any more
prompts but the desktop version doesn't
that's lame this one's a Lambo Oh
welcome to the party dude yeah sure
we're talking about my Civic it's a joke
it is a super limo joke yeah so this
this is this is the thing I've been
looking at that's a nice look and by
looking at I mean
drooling over don't don't look at don't
look at this Wow don't look at that kind
of okay see I'm just trying to remember
the range yeah okay so the 20 kilowatt
hour battery pack is 160 to a hundred
and a hundred miles range at highway
speed but there's different battery pack
options so they're probably talking
about this look how you knew that and
the basic ya know I knew they were
different better a couple of things I
still don't like it's pretty heavy it's
significantly heavier than mine yeah
it's probably mostly in the batteries
but so okay I haven't actually pitched
this to the wife yet but let me let me
try something out on you and see how it
goes okay first I need to know though
yes because this would be important for
her as well for sure are you selling
your bike sure I'll sell my bike I'm
gonna have anywhere to keep it and are
you then not replacing the car
oh no I'm replace the car so your can we
get this and a car okay just just shut
up shut up okay she's gonna think so so
pretty much everyone and their dog has
been like your tech guy got a Model S
that's boring okay right well that's
kind it's kind of my response to that
because the funny thing about the super
Civic is that it's horrible but if your
car is supposed to be a reflection of
something about you like your car does
say something about you the super Civic
for better or for worse is the Linus
mobile
so you want something rolling right past
em electric because you're super fast no
no that's no no it's not that it's not
that I just mean I mean it's been
interesting this is a reflection of your
participant in a hard for no no I'm not
talking about this right now I just mean
it's been hard for me to replace the
super Civic for multiple reasons one I
hate car shopping yeah - it's really is
such it is such a perfect fit for me not
now but it was it was before it got a
little - now it's too much it was the
soup it was the zero FS mobile yeah
super practical yeah reliable cheap
cheap standard super cheap standard
everything even Windows yeah that I
wasn't a fan of No well the windows are
okay no AC was a problem though yeah um
it's getting worse I really bad heat
wave recently sucked
um anyway so it's been like the me
mobile and it's been hard to find
something that says anything about me a
Model S doesn't know that's my issue
with the Model S yeah
the Model S says absolutely nothing
about Linus Sebastian the person other
than oh you're a tech guy get a Model S
okay it's also really expensive it's
also really expensive but but based on
that everyone's telling you to buy a
Model S I figure people won't be like
mad if I say look I haven't replaced my
car in ten years I'm getting a Model S
do you think people would resent that I
don't think people would be mad I don't
think it works for you I think it's
ludicrously expensive okay okay so so
let's assume that people you know and
there's no right to repair on Model S's
on Tesla I've heard a lot about this
recently oh right to repair on this is
like like Tesla and right to repair are
like not friends which this is I very
recently heard about this but that's not
a that's not so I'm gonna pitch
something here I'm gonna pitch something
here for the cost of one Model S I could
get a clarity plug-in hybrid and you for
the daily commute and a super bike that
doesn't mean you're supposed to spend
that much money it means that I could
but it doesn't mean that yours and it
would be the same as if I go to Model S
but you shouldn't have gotten a more or
less funny funny probably shouldn't do
that okay I want to hear from twitch
chat I need a second opinion of course
they're going
I need a second opinion second opinion
okay okay
people are like mkbhd you got a Model S
that makes a lot of sense don't know
about Linus okay I could borrow my
counter superbike means midlife crisis
dude dude what
okay Vaughan can I pitch you something
this is really important okay so so okay
we need a straw poll no no you got it
can you can you stop pull it up okay so
no no no no no she can just she can come
she can come sit with me
we're we're we're good friends here you
guys hang out sometime we can we're not
afraid of a little bit of physical
contact made pretty babies you know okay
ow all the keys in my pocket are killing
my thigh you're why are you still so bad
at this what killing my killing my lap
actually I also have like keyboard in my
pocket okay
I need to I need to reach the thing okay
so I'm gonna go question I run something
by you get it or don't get it because
okay so Model S costs okay so the Model
S costs uh why is it why don't they just
put loan what what is the difference
between lease and Loan
that's stupid like what is what is a
loan no alone I think is when you get
financing Oh financing why don't we just
say financing well that is what that
means okay so a Model S is anywhere from
okay the federal tax credit this is us
oh crap okay well whatever it's about
eighty five thousand Canadian plus
whatever I mean I would there's no way I
wouldn't get the autopilot upgrade and
stuff like that so let's say about
eighty to ninety thousand Canadian okay
so would I be allowed to get a more or
less okay so would I be allowed to get
one I don't know it just has to make
sense okay but could I could I make some
kind of argument that that would make
sense
no not actually okay why because it's
not practical it's not really sheet
seven it's not really you see seven a
minivan seats how many people and cost a
fraction of that okay yeah this much may
be true okay um I mean okay so so from a
practicalities at that point no okay if
it was just like I really want this okay
you could probably make that argue
that's all I need that's all I need okay
so now how about this how about a very
practical car that costs half as much
and a superbike that also costs half as
much how about that but it's a lightning
zero to sixty in two seconds two seconds
does that sound like a good thing for
the father of you don't want you to die
we have life insurance now all right
thank you I would say I should just do
it anyway oh I have to go no no we all
have to go actually okay I would say
that I should just do it anyway but the
cold hard truth is she completely
controls all the money yeah I wouldn't
be able to buy a hamburger without her
knowing about it like it's actually a
problem like I can't surprise her with a
gift or anything because all the credit
for the draw withdraw cash it's actually
yeah but if I was through cash it would
seem very unusual if it was any more
than like a hundred bucks here and there
like I like to carry a little bit of
cash because a lot of places in Richmond
only take cash yeah but that's the only
reason I carry cash so unless I like
flip something on Craigslist recently I
don't have a tongue I don't have a ton
of cash on hand so she saw like you know
a few hundred dollars come out of the
account should be like hey someone have
your card some have you been yeah like
no no well what was this what was this
what's wrong because it's literally her
job like actually her job every day to
keep track of all the money
yeah no no it's not like a control freak
thing she's just literally the financial
officer of both our family and our
company so yeah they'd be okay well let
me let me see the straw poll can I at
least see the straw poll results I
haven't even seen it okay what's what's
a URL here it's a case sensitive oh it's
pretty close hold on me / nobody got one
six two yeah zero six three yeah six
seven okay let's have a look here let's
share the results with everybody let's
get these real-time I mean I got a vote
I got a vote right yeah like you know
Obama got to vote for himself so I
should get to vote for myself get it
vote okay have a look at these these
here votes here there Wow straw polls
guy work on that there thing they got
Wow someone in the fee someone in the
building has already voted oh really
did you vote yeah I voted oh did you not
get to vote oh I'm sorry to hear that oh
what a big bummer that is Oh bummer
ah so bought it looks like you were
wrong 56% of people said do it yeah so I
mean this is Democratic Society um you
know my might makes right quantity in
numbers okay it's not the argument
got a lot of people telling me to get
the oddest forgetting me on the car sick
like the the like moon do that
popularizing this car like the first
like maybe I think was on VHS I was like
super in a drifting was from Japan and
he was driving a true no 86 okay all
right bye everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
