GoPro camera in the non waterproof case
in spite of the fact that it is
sprinkling a little bit because we're
not going to be going over a hundred
miles an hour yes we're definitely not
going to be doing that today especially
not in the super Civic which is my car
because it gives you better sound
recording in that mode okay so I want to
show you guys sort of okay here here
here first first let's let's go clip the
car so I'm supposed to attach it kind of
here right cameraman lower okay
cameraman says I should attach it lower
on the car so you can see how dirty my
car is I'm using a ShamWow to clean my
car okay so Vince would be proud there
we go
what about that yes it's dirty I know
I'll put it here okay you wants me to
put it more like up here okay so
cameraman can't make it his mind
apparently now my ShamWow is forever
ruined except I can just wash it and
it'll be just fine new again great okay
so I'm going to be taking the I've
actually extended this as much as
possible with the included mounting
hardware so if I loosen this one a
little bit I have all this flexibility
in terms of mounting I should go like
this I can go like here you can see I
can move it like this okay so I'm gonna
go ahead I'm gonna stick the suction cup
on press the button and it is suction
cup so in theory the camera doesn't fall
off even if I'm going along on the
highway so just undo this now you have
lots of other mounting options too you
have the chest tripod which is not part
of the mounting options that are oh
that's a bad sign okay just a second I
must have done it hold on hold on just
okay cameraman helps me get it on there
it's on there good now so yeah it's all
good everything is okay so there you go
right now I was gonna show you the other
mounting options so you've got little
double-sided curvy things so if I were
to mount it somewhere curved like say
for example here I'd put that there and
then I can mount the GoPro on to there
or there's a flat one so five minutes
somewhere flat like say for example up
here I can put it there or
right you've got a couple of different
arms that'll clip directly onto those so
if you were to put it say for example on
the roof of your car
and you might just take this one put
that there and then you can clip the
GoPro in like this and it will you can
ever things there you go then I'll sit
on top of your car like that so you have
different options but we are going to be
using the complicated option because
that is what we do we take the most
elaborate possible way of doing things
and we do it okay so my car's gonna look
really stupid with this one clean spot
on it now but whatever that is not
camera man's concern apparently okay so
we're gonna go ahead and screw this bad
boy in here almost in almost in all the
way there we go okay so the camera is
attached we can adjust everything then
we're gonna go ahead and fasten
everything pretty good so hopefully this
is sort of pointed in the right
direction when we actually start driving
the vehicle now okay well cameraman's
going to get the manual right now but
I'm pretty sure that I've got it figured
out I think I'm recording in 1080p and I
think that it is working so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna put it into the
little keys now bear in mind that I'm
turning it on before I put it in the
case but I don't think that it's
necessarily even more surest way to do
it I think you can actually turn it on
after you put it in the case because you
that's what the buttons are here for so
the button on the front is for turning
the unit on as well as changing settings
and then the button on the top allows us
to cycle through the settings to change
and then it also starts recording when
we're ready to do that so let's get the
car started up here and see if we can
catch cameraman coming out of the
building with the instruction manual
oh that's something he didn't think of
mounting it on the door let's see if
I've opened the door all the way no it
won't quite match the GoPro against the
size of Park
so I should probably do a text
disclaimer as well but yeah you know how
the caption usually says professional
driver on a closed course do not attempt
this blah blah blah this was an
unprofessional driver and a completely
unauthorized area do not attempt this so
this is just me screwing around in the
Yugo Civic do not try that we're just
gonna turn the GoPro off here and then
we're gonna go ahead and remove it take
the suction cup off of my car now you go
and actually just gonna turn the unit
off so that's with the front button here
so the LCD displays all kinds of useful
information actually I guess I don't
really need to take it out of there for
analysis hold a suction cup off the car
and head back inside as if nothing
happened so thanks for checking out this
episode of Linus tech tips about the
GoPro don't forget to subscribe for more
computer videos it's hard to call this a
computer video but whatever you guys get
the point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
