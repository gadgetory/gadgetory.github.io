something that I personally feel pretty
strongly about if you guys have been
watching me for any length of time you
probably are aware already that I'm a
bit of a silence freak when it comes to
computers and very few things get my
motor running to the same extent that
fanless power supplies do so this one
right here is from roseville which is a
brand you've probably never seen me
feature on this channel before but
there's a first time for everything and
this is the silent night 500 watt 80
plus platinum fanless power supply so
the idea is that you could actually
power a gaming grade machine with even
something like a gtx 680 3570k a couple
SSDs off a power supply that actually
doesn't need a fan to run it comes with
a five-year warranty it has modular
cables it uses him let's go ahead and
flip over onto the back a single strong
12 volt rail that is capable of
providing almost the entire 500 watts of
output so this is pretty common to see
on very high efficiency power supplies
like 80 plus platinum because most of
the time they are using a 12 volt 25
volt and 3.3 volt converter a dc-to-dc
converter in order to achieve those
other rails so that's why the 12 volt
rail is capable of the entire output of
it so comprehensive protections with
your overcurrent over-voltage oh under
over power under voltage sure took a
protection all that good stuff and me
remember guys roseville doesn't actually
manufacture the power supply it's more
to do with them finding an OEM that's
able to achieve all of the safety
ratings and design requirements and then
they are bringing it to market so
multi-gpu support with 4 x pci e 6 plus
2 pin connectors this is something that
I have never seen on a silent power
supply normally you're lucky if they
include two PCIe connectors so inside
here we find a user's manual which
basically says all the stuff that's on
the packaging already nice closed cell
foam so you don't have to worry about it
getting damaged and shipping look at
that they include both thumb screws and
regular screws for mounting it into your
case depending on what it's compatible
with just very helpful so
zip ties as well as a standard power
cord a little bit thin power cord but
honestly it's a 500 watt power supply so
I don't think it's an issue then we have
Z power supply itself whew this has a
really nice finish on it I'm actually
super super stoked on that check this
out that is right up there with the
Strider gold evo I believe it's called
from Silverstone with that sort of
textured black finish not only does it
make it look outstanding but it also is
much more durable than a than a flatter
fish so what they've done is in order to
make keep it from just being shiny
they've textured it but it's a glossy
paint so velocity paints are inherently
more durable than flat paints because
they have more resin and less of
whatever the other things in paint are
but what that means is it will be it'll
be more scratch resistant while also
just looking awesome so there you go
you've got lots of ventilation now
fanless power supplies are intended to
be installed one way and one way one way
only so right here you've got
ventilation holes all over on the
outside and then here you've got what is
a heat sink so presumably internal
components are connected to that somehow
I actually can't see how they've done it
yes there we go so there you have heat
sinks coming up from the bottom up to
the heat sink on the top and then it
also acts as a passive exhaust so you
can see that so some of the air is going
to be just passively waft it up through
the top of the power supply and that'll
be in taked to take it in along the
sides now in terms of pre-attached
connectors we've got a fairly basic
compliment so this is what I would
normally call a semi modular power
supply where it has your basic stuff
that you'll probably need ninety-nine
percent of the time pre-attached so
there's your 24-pin connector there's
your four plus four and then there are
26 plus 2s so that will power one
graphics card and then the rest of it is
all done with modular cables so they
include a nice little rose bowl pack
that has everything else you'll need
they're not expecting you to hook up a
bajillion things to this so they only
include I would have liked to see to
Santa harnesses
and oh no this is a mixed one okay
that's not so bad okay that's kind of
clever okay so they've got a three molex
in one floppy connector one they have a
2 Zeta and two molex connector one so
this would be really useful if you have
a case that has like a basement like
something like a TJ 07 where you want to
have sort of a couple drives down there
may be a water cooling pump or whatever
else you're going to have a mixture of
what's connected to it and then finally
a quad sada harness that you can run to
your drive cage or wherever else that
you're actually going to plug in a bunch
of drives and last but not least you've
got another dual 6+2 pin connector so
that will take out all four of the
modular interface connections on the
back of the power supply giving you the
total potential to install six SATA
devices six molex devices and for PCI
Express six plus two connectors so
that's up to two high-performance video
cards with that said I wouldn't go and
start throwing duel gtx 690 this thing
okay use your common sense it's a 500
watt power supply so make sure that so
what I really say is like two mid-range
cards in sli or a single high-end card
and make sure that whatever case you're
using with it actually has some space
above the power supply because passively
cooled doesn't mean it doesn't need
cooling it just means that it is able to
as long as it has some airflow around it
it is able to be cool enough without its
own dedicated fan thank you for checking
