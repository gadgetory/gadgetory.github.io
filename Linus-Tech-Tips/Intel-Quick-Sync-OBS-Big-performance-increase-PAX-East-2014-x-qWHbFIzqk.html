2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys so Intel Quick Sync
with OBS what does this mean it allows
you to use the GPU part of your CPU on
Intel to encode things so instead of
using a h.264 encoder or whatever else
you're using to do all of your encoding
you're able to move that off of the CPU
part of your CPU and onto the GPU which
would otherwise be doing nothing if you
have a dedicated graphics card in your
system this is great because it's
allowing you to squeeze more performance
out of your computer that you otherwise
would not be able to do my other
favorite thing other than just the
performance increases of this is the
fact that anyone with an Intel processor
that has quick sync right now is able to
use this this isn't like a future thing
not only people that buy future CPUs are
gonna be able to get this is anyone that
has a processor that can run quick sync
tonight's value add for those of you
that already owned the product and I
really like seeing companies do that you
know the set up for this is quite easy
all you have to do is go in and change a
radio button in your OBS settings from
whatever you have using the encoder
right now over to Quick Sync and you're
done wham bam that's it you get a huge
perform an increase and that's
absolutely fantastic if you liked this
