test bench that I'm going to be using
over the next little while here for an
upcoming tech tips project you can see
I'm using all of the the best and latest
stuff sort of thing I've got an EVGA
classified x 58 4 Way SLI board I mean
the video cards not exceptional it's a
gtx 260 but I've got the OCZ vertex
limited edition in there as well anyway
I came across something that I thought
was sort of worth mentioning and it's a
new Intel stock cooler so you can see
that this cooler is is a heat pipe
design unlike previous Intel stock
coolers it has four heat pipes that each
run down through the base one two three
four and then up to the top and you can
see it's got like a nice little intel
cap and another thing that it also has
is it has quiet versus a performance
mode on it much like their old Extreme
Edition cooler which actually do need to
do if I go over to my work PC I have one
of those in my in my work PC so you can
see that one is blue LED fan and it has
a little switch right about there that
allows you to turn the RPMs up or down
and let me see if I can
not sure if you could hear the
difference in sound but I have it in
quiet mode for the most part anyway
let's go back over here so anyway this
is taking a while to focus here let's
see if it can do it come on
there you go okay so it has what appears
to be a 92 millimeter fan for pin pwm
design and unlike previous Intel stock
coolers this is the best part I think it
actually uses a backplate to mount to
the CPU so rather than relying on those
pushpins we've got it's a plastic
backplate so there's nothing
particularly great about it it's it's
gonna flex a little bit but that's not
going to matter because the most
important thing is just that we're using
thumb screws which push through to a
backplate rather than relying on plastic
pushpins I think that pretty much covers
everything I wanted to say about it but
there you have it that's uh clipped on
there the new Intel stock heatsink oh
and I should do the obligatory like
finger shininess shot here so you can
see the bottom is lapped to be very very
very shiny so you can see my camera now
another interesting thing I noticed
about this cooler and I apologize in
advance for the terrible lighting that's
going on right now just blew a breaker
and the light above me is is actually
out but another thing I noticed is like
a lot of aftermarket heat sinks these
days you can see that the new Intel
stock cooler is bowed you can tell by
the very bare patch in the middle where
the CPU heatsink is making very very
strong contact with the processor itself
so all I did was tighten the thumbscrews
down as far as they go which as far as I
can tell us what you're supposed to do
and you can see I got very much more
build-up around the outside and in a
very very good contact patch right in
the middle very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
