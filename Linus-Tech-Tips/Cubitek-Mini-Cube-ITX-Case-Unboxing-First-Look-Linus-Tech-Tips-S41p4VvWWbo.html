the cuba tech mini cube this right here
is a little mini ITX enclosure that is
just over nineteen liters in volume
inside so their claim to fame with this
guy is that it can accommodate VGA cards
that are up to 280 millimeters and it
has cable management in the back of the
motherboard tray so they are saying that
this is the first mini ITX enclosure
with cable management now I wouldn't say
that this is quite you know factual
because something like an FTO 3 mini
from Silverstone does have cable
management but it doesn't necessarily
have the same kind of a form factor as a
more traditional PC case so let's go
ahead and find out what's inside so cube
attack uses all aluminum construction so
I'm expecting it to be a fairly basic
case in terms of the sort of like you
know no plastic pieces you know
injection molded this or that but what
we will find inside is quality
manufacturing so they use like brushed
aluminum finishes and nice lightweight
design and here's the manual fairly
basic fairly straightforward nothing
really out of the ordinary there in fact
what I should be doing is showing you
the manual here so that we can use our
b-roll camera for that we don't have a
second camera operator today
unfortunately so we're just going to
have to make do without also here I have
all of the included accessories so they
come in just a plain ziplock baggie so
that'll be all your mounting screws
motherboard standoffs a bunch of rubber
grommets that appear to be for
presumably mounting yep heart there's
your hard drive rubbers what else we got
your buzzer I think they mean speaker of
all so hello I got to go through all of
them now your m3 l6 screw that one
wasn't fun your number 632 screw no fun
o m5 okay sure well that was that was
all the fun ones anyway we got to the
fun ones right at the beginning there's
your standoffs
and then we get to the case itself so it
comes packed in a soft foam as you guys
know soft foams are my favorite foams
it's fairly thin but guys this is an ITX
case so the expectation from the
manufacturer and from me for that matter
is that you actually wouldn't be you
wouldn't be putting you know like a
triple radiator liquid cooled triple SLI
machine in here because it simply won't
fit so you don't have that much weight
to worry about now I am going to go
retrieve myself some lumps which I will
use to handle this case and I would
recommend that you do the same because
brushed aluminum finishes look beautiful
but the problem you run into is that
they're very easy to stain and once you
stain them then they are not as
beautiful so I'm just going to show the
b-roll camera with the side panel looks
like here again there's that brushed
aluminum on the front we just find a
cubit eclogue Oh as well as a power and
reset button
here's your indicator LEDs and then on
the other side
hopefully the that camera can see the
indicator LEDs and the power and reset
switches on the other side we find just
plain black aluminum and on the back
there is room for the i/o shield two PCI
expansion slots so you could install a
single graphics government or I TX only
has one expansion slot so you can
install a single dual slot graphics card
for example and then there's your
standard ATX power supply an 80 or a 92
millimeter fan mount and finally we've
got the i/o on the top of the case here
we find two USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0
ports a headphone jack a microphone jack
and that is pretty much all she wrote
now there's no tool list opening for
this guy so we're going to have to grab
a screwdriver we'll be right back now
once we open it up we find out what they
meant by mini cube they meant a mini
case that is in fact in the shape of a
cube so here on the back we find all
those hard drive mounts so you can do
either for two and a half inch or two
three and a half in
with all these different hard drive
mounting options here now I let the oh
there we go
nope there we go I let the instructions
get away from me here but they actually
show you on the back how you can use the
various holes actually okay well I guess
I should do this how you can use the
various holes to mount either two and a
half inch or three and a half inch
drives they also give you the sort of
recommended order in which you install
things which i think is actually quite
important because this is going to be a
very small case once you've got a
motherboard that goes to here a CPU
cooler that goes here and then a
graphics card that potentially goes all
the way across here now you can install
sort of the first question I asked when
I saw the initial the layout of this guy
is where do I put my intake fan where
does the intake fan go because the front
of the case is completely clean the top
of the case is completely clean as are
the side panels so you could potentially
intake from the top and then set your
power supply up as an exhaust so there's
a filtered intake on the bottom of that
but you could flip it over instead and
then have it draw air from the inside of
the case and exhaust it the other option
here is to install a 120 millimeter fan
in the front of the case so you can see
from the bottom there's either room to
mount a two and a half inch SSD there or
a 120 millimeter cooling fan so I would
probably go the cooling fan option
especially if you're putting in a high
performance graphics card now you hear
that other side panel rattling that's
not because the side panel rattles due
to some kind of a manufacturing defect
it is because I have pre loosened all
the screws so that I can show you how it
comes off so there's four screws one in
each corner and I almost dropped that
one so you just take all of those off
and last one there we go and now we get
access to the back of the motherboard
tray that's actually not bad oh yeah you
can see the side panels here quite quite
thick aluminum actually very nice so the
back of the motherboard tray has a good
inch of space back there that's
outstanding so you can see there's lots
of room for cable management as well as
holes cut here and up near the
motherboard and at the front of the case
that are also for cable management so if
I'm going to try and eyeball this that's
pretty tough but it looks like one here
one here and one here and one
here for three and a half inch drives
and then the two and a half inch spacing
must be there somewhere but it's pretty
pretty tough to eyeball so here's here's
what a two and a half inch drive oh no
those are two and a half inches there so
that's one two three four somewhere well
I'll take there I'll take their word for
it I suppose we'll be back in a moment
slick and I figured it out all right
so it goes like this one two three four
two and a half inch drives or three
three and a half inch drives so those
ones will go to do here here and here so
you have the option for what you want to
put on the back you could even do two
three and a half inch to two and a half
inch and then if you didn't install that
cooling fan then you could do an
additional two and a half inch here so
there's actually a lot of expansion room
so we're really excited to do a build in
this particular little chassis and I
think that pretty much wraps up the
unboxing don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for on boxing's reviews
and other computer videos and it's
extremely light in case you guys were
wondering about that oh yeah
front connectors I didn't even show
these so front connector wise you've got
your front USB three your friend HD
audio your front power reset all that
good stuff and front USB three so those
are all just done by one big panel up
here that then leads sort of
through the back and goes wherever you
need it to go probably out mostly here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
