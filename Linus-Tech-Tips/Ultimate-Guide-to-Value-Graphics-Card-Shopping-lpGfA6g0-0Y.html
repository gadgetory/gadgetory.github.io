on AMD's dual graphics or the ability to
basically run your integrated GPU and
your discrete GPU that's like an add-in
card in crossfire have you got an
unlocked Intel processor do you want
access to exclusive offers click now to
join Intel Club enthusiasts and get
started so we showed you the numbers
that we got in a couple of games with
AMD's latest Kaveri 7850 k apu alone
that apu running with a discrete
graphics card on r7 250 running by
itself and we showed you what it's like
when we pair them together in dual
graphics mode well you guys asked for an
expanded test so we've thrown two more
discrete graphics cards into the mix and
r7 260x and a g4 750 Ti and we've thrown
in more CPUs so we've got a 46 70 K
that's a core i5 from Intel that we've
run with discrete and on board a 6800 K
so that's AMD zone last generation APU
and an Athlon 760 K which is a very
inexpensive cpu from AMD with no onboard
graphics at all but based on the same
architecture as that last gen APU now
before we dive into this I want it to be
clear that Kaveri has other benefits
that are not being tested in this video
HSA or heterogeneous system architecture
allows the GPU cores on Andy's latest
apu to be utilized for general
productivity tasks much more efficiently
efficiently than previous architectures
allowed it can share system memory
rather than having data copied back and
forth between the CPU and GPU Ram over
the PCI Express bus which opens up a
whole new world of cooperation between
your CPU cores and your graphics cores
this enables today better performance
with some image filters improved
thumbnail creation and Windows better
performance in libreoffice and some
other things but HSA is mostly about the
future with some very exciting
developments such as open CL 2.0 with a
compliant driver expected in early 2015
and I'll add good stuff the bad news is
that we'll have to wait for software
development
but the good news is that application
developers and compiler writers should
if AMD is to be believed find it easier
to code for HSA systems which should
help drive adoption with all of that
aside if you're a value gamer and you're
looking for a system today what do you
buy well we saw your comments on the
previous video and on the forum and
science wins so I was let loose and I
was able to test almost all of the
things alright guys as these graphs are
a lot more compact with data than our
normal graphs I'll give you guys some
tips on reading them fairly standard
fare the CPU and GPU are listed on the
left-hand side so you can see what row
that correlates with to help you guys
differentiate between the rows I've also
color-coordinated each row with based on
its CPU not its GPU so you can see how
the different CPU combinations stack up
that way also there's a dollar value
right beside the name of the combination
and that dollar value is an estimated
guess based on numbers that I pulled
from newegg.com so these are American
prices if you're an international viewer
I would highly suggest when you get to
the dollar per performance graphs later
on that's the second set of two that you
base them based on numbers in your own
region also these dollar values do not
include the cost of the motherboard as
that can vary quite a bit and was not a
super important variable in these tests
I'm sure you guys will come up with your
own conclusions and let me know in the
comments below and on the forum and all
that kind of stuff but here's some
conclusions of my own that I gathered
from looking at my graphs after I made
them there seems to be a sweet spot for
both of these games in Far Cry 3 that
sweet spot is about seven dollars while
in Bioshock that sweet spot is about
five dollars that makes sense because
BioShock Infinite is easier to run than
Far Cry 3 therefore your dollar per
performance goes down which is a good
thing but you're going to need to be
able to run certain games so it all kind
of makes sense although to be completely
honest for most of these set ups the
price that you're paying you're getting
1080p on high at no problem so it makes
a ton of sense especially one last thing
personally I would not buy a solo 46 70k
for gaming by that I mean 46 MDK and no
discrete graphics card it does not
perform very well and personally I'd
rather pay less than a 46 70 K and get a
7 60 K and an r7 260x or pay $10 more
and get a 760 K and a 750ti and get even
more performance on top of that that
makes a lot more sense to me but again
just let me know what you guys think in
the comments down below and on the forum
so a main takeaway I would grab from
this is I going back a few generations
and grabbing a processor from that time
at a really low price and then buying a
nicer more powerful graphics card and
pairing those two together is an awesome
combination that you need a lot of power
for your price with that combination
another thing is that 1080p gaming has
been never this valuable at a price
point like this you can run games at
high at 1080p and get epic frame rates
that's really cool to see because value
gaming has always kind of been a shove
under the bus but now you can go with a
very nice resolution very nice settings
at a very nice price point and have a
really good experience and the word
console killer was brought around a lot
when the consoles were first coming out
and we all knew it would be easier to
surpass consoles later on down the line
I didn't realize it would be this fast
with certain setups that we have in this
video even and with 750ti 750 and 260x
now taking up bat it's really easy to
actually just beat the absolute crap out
of a console a lot of console games
aren't running at 1080p and they're not
running that fast and with a setup like
this you can run it at really good frame
rates at 1080p at high settings with AAA
on and all that kind of stuff so it's a
very interesting setup and I hope you
guys are going to take advantage of this
kind of stuff if you're building a
console build in the future just so you
guys know as well our star system team
is in second place and I know most of
the times I upload a video and call it
what place were in it's inaccurate but I
think this might be the first time it's
actually accurate so be sure to join up
we have a lot of fun and the dogfighting
module should be coming around sometime
around April 18th so Luke's testing
reveals a bit of a problem with the way
the term value gets thrown around to
describe inexpensive products value is
not the same thing as cheap I understand
that for some people they're going to
have 300 dollars to spend on a PC and
even if they could have something 10
times better for another ten dollars
that won't be feasible so they will need
to settle for the reduced price to
performance ratio of a cheap computer
for those folks who
do have the regular income that would
allow them to save a couple more
allowances or skim some money off a
couple more paychecks the advice I've
always given wait until you can afford
something decent continues to ring true
grabbing a Kaveri today and running with
on board then upgrading later with a
discreet graphics card does make a fair
bit of sense if you're impatient and you
don't want to wait to save up another
sixty to seventy dollars for the cheap
CPU and mid-range GPU upfront but make
sure that when it comes time to upgrade
to a mid-range GPU you are picking one
based on its individual merits not just
based on dual graphics compatibility the
r7 260x or the 750 Ti cannot take
advantage of the onboard graphics for
you know enhanced gaming the way the r7
250 can but because they're so much
better it doesn't matter this may change
in the future when the onboard can be
used for AI or something as a
coprocessor but we're still a fair way
away from that and if you're buying a
graphics card today for games you can
play now and you want the most for your
money then you're going to want to get a
proper discrete graphics card just like
has been the case up till now
sorry dual graphics you're just not the
most for my money at this point in time
speaking of getting the most for your
money we've got an exciting new sponsor
now I switched to an electric shaver
three years ago because I was too cheap
and more importantly too lazy to deal
with the bit of buying replacement
blades for my razor it does a decidedly
worse job of removing hair from my face
and to my dismay it turns out I'm still
supposed to buy replacement blades for
the thing I haven't replaced the blade
on it once so I guess it's time for a
new strategy dollar shave club you know
the our blades are great guys
their whole concept is that for a few
bucks a month less than the price of
buying brand-name razors and cartridges
with unnecessary like vibrating handles
and like built-in speakers and stuff you
can get fantastic blades shipped
straight to your door
by a highly skilled and diverse team of
people and bears the cost savings is
great but for me the appeal is really
the convenience
of having fresh bathroom stuff delivered
every month no more like you know maybe
I can get like one more shame out of
this element replica blame the BAM there
goes the jugular they've also got dr.
Carver's easy shave butter which is
clear instead of foamy so you can
actually see what you're doing and one
wipe Charlies which are basically bot
wipes for men with a peppermint infusion
I tried to say that with a straight face
but I couldn't do it so start shaving
time and shaving Money join now at
