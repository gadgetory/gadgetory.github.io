welcome to Linus tech tips today we're
going to be having a look at the H 90
and the H 110 from Corsair these are
their new 140 millimeter radiator
coolers so I'm going to take the H 90
and I'm going to compare it really
quickly here to the H ATI so while the H
ATI uses Corsair Lincoln has flagship
features like 3/8 inch tubes as well as
their new magnetic mounting clips so you
can see the actual blocks themselves
there are quite different the H 90 has
the advantage of using a very dense fin
arrangement and a larger surface area
radiator the H Adi is also a little bit
thicker that gives it an advantage in
performance versus other 120-millimeter
products that are thinner so the H 90
has a lot of surface area compared to
the H ATI the H 110 similarly has much
larger surface area than the age 100 so
we wanted to look at how this translates
to performance now this is something
that's really important for these
coolers because the H 90 and the H 110
come with fans that aren't really
anything special in terms of their
radiator optimization whereas the H ATI
and the H 100 I come with Corsair
well a derivative of course there's SP
series static pressure optimized fans so
these the the larger radiator versions
are going to get a bit of an advantage
in our testing compared to what you
might see from other guys because we run
a test bench that uses standardized fans
so we actually don't use the fans that
are included with any coolers because we
want to find out how the performance of
the coolers themselves compares to each
other so we only use n ff12 pwm fans and
I think what are they nf a 14 FLX fans
so that's a 120 millimeter and 140
millimeter pressure optimized fan design
from Noctua these are quiet fans we run
the 120 mils and the 140 mils at around
a thousand rpm so it's a very quiet
solution
so in a consistent that I would consider
to be quiet enough for a
high-performance gaming system these
days because there's no reason for them
to be loud this is how these coolers
will perform we have a 3930k that's
overclocked and over volted so we're
able to deliver a lot of heat to these
coolers so you can really separate the
performance from each other in this case
we also run a 580 graphics card so it's
a GTX 580 and we run combustor during
our load test to simulate what it would
be like if the cooler had to work inside
a case that's actually full of hot
components as well so it doesn't
necessarily just you know work on an
open test bench and get to suck fresh
cool air through it no this is how it
will actually perform in a system that
also has other components that are
generating Heat we close up both side
panels during our testing and we let the
coolers reach equilibrium before we take
any of our measurements and we measure
the ambient temperatures at the intake
of the case here using an H age 506 are
a multi logger thermometer that allows
us to make sure that whatever results we
deliver you once we correct them 220
degrees are going to be easily
comparable from one cooler to another
because we're able to we can't control
the ambience in here but what we can do
is we can monitor them monitor them and
then correct for that so I think that
pretty much wraps it up in terms of the
the prologue to this so oh yeah so we
have the H 110 in there if you guys
wanted to see it this is a Corsair C 70
so the H 110 is I guess I'll spoil the
surprise a little bit the highest
performing CPU cooler that we've tested
it's absolutely enormous and fills up
the entire top of this case so in spite
of its quarter inch tubing and less
advanced design compared to the H H 100
I come check out the performance so load
corrected to 20 degrees Celsius for the
H 110 in a pole configuration is only 66
degrees now we have a bit of an anomaly
in our data and that's that the kraken x
60 doesn't perform as well as the h 110
in spite of the fact that we're using
the same fans but there might be an
issue with our kraken x 60 either way
the h 110 performs exactly the way that
we'd expect so the h 90 actually puts up
a pretty good showing as well performing
only about 4 degrees worse than the h
100 i and then the
yeah the H 110 just kind of runs away
with it it beats the H 100 I by about 5
degrees so this is on a 6 core processor
so guys what you can do is you can
download this chart you can actually
click the link below the video
description if you want to check out at
your leisure and we're going to keep
updating it we're going to keep adding
any notes that we have on our testing
methodology and you notes we have on the
cooler so many future coolers that we
test are all going to be on this master
chart this is our test bench for the
foreseeable future so you guys will
always know what to expect when you get
a cooler and especially if you're going
to upgrade to your own pressure
optimized fans I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video I don't have anything
to hold and point at hi yes about the
performance of the H 90 and H 110 from
