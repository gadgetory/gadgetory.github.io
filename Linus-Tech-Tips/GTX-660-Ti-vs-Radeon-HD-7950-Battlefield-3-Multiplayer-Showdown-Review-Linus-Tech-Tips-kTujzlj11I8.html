asking me forever for multiplayer
battlefield 3 benchmarks and since I
suck at video games I'm getting slick to
handle this for me so he's basically on
map first firestorm thank you and he is
going to rip along the same path in this
Jeep and hope he doesn't die for a two
minute run he's going to sort of head
into some more intensive areas than just
being out in the desert I hope at some
point uh yeah he's heading over to like
some yeah stuff's going down now see you
can see he's gonna like smash into a car
you have to hit that car again next time
I hope you know that oh if you can hit
the same mind again next time then we're
okay so let's trying again he's sort of
saying that maybe the Jeep wasn't the
great oh yeah three to the point of this
video is for battlefield 3 multiplayer
users who are want to know whether to
get a gtx 660ti or what by our reckoning
is the most equivalent card the Radeon
HD if I can find it 7950 so this guy
right here so we're just going to be
doing a head-to-head showdown of 660ti
power Edition from MSI vs sapphire 7950
OC with the dual fan cooler these are
going to be running at their stock
overclocked settings so we're not
overclocking them further but they are
going to be running at a slightly
overclocked settings so slick is doing a
two-minute run in a tank since the Jeep
thing didn't work out very well for us
in order to give us some real gameplay
sort of ah is that normal under attack
okay so yeah I haven't played
battlefield anything really much at all
and he's apparently getting pwned in
some way maybe you should just do this
on foot this time we're going to go in
the tank for a little bit and then
slicks going to get out
just go on foot in order to infiltrate
the enemy base because we haven't gotten
anywhere near the enemy base yet
apparently the mine was something to do
with their base he's nodding but I don't
believe him so fire the cannon like not
what people do in video games we're
trying to have like gameplay footage
here we're not footage but like you know
real world gaming performance of this
graphics card so we're recording with
fraps this is going to be a really long
video just due to all the epic failures
that are in it but I don't know you're
probably going to get pwned again here
unless you can see see you're gonna die
you might die you basically die now
every moment you stay alive is one
minute closer to death okay you kill the
guy that's good you got 100 points
that's probably more points than I have
on my battlefield 3 account so we're
going to do shoe runs one with this card
one with the other card and we're going
to bring you the results incidentally
this is a very full server so this will
give us a realistic idea of how our
3930k and these video cards will perform
with 16 gigs around in battlefield 3 in
a real game if we can ever get the
benchmark done if slick and stay alive
for two minutes so slick took so long to
manage to runs where he didn't die that
I got food if you can call that food so
basically what we concluded is that in
battlefield 3 multiplayer at 1080p at
all maximum settings Ultra presets is
that the gtx 660ti achieves well I don't
know if it was their goal or I don't
know what they were trying to do but add
stock speeds it comes in and eats the 79
50s lunch they're very very close they
both have exactly the same minimum fps
in the game doing approximately the same
run with nice full servers and the 660ti
is cheaper so there you go also you get
support for all those Nvidia
technologies like 3d vision as well as
physics which this game doesn't care
about but some of them do such as
Borderlands 2 or Batman Arkham City or
whatever else and I think that pretty
much wraps up this video so slick you
want to give them a nice good view of
the graph where you can see the
approximately sort of 3 percent
some performance between the two cards
showing you that the 660ti is pretty
much a beast don't forget to subscribe
to latest tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
cross fly no I'm just kidding it doesn't
work like that but when it does work
like is results for you guys so slick
did finally managed to get some
benchmarks done and what we discovered
is that the 7950 and the 660ti are
basically neck-and-neck when it comes to
battlefield 3 performance so there you
go thank you for coming along with us on
this wild ride of learning which one
actually performs better multiplayer you
know what I didn't do is I didn't
compare these results to our single
player performance because I've had
people complaining better to me bitterly
to me that I only benchmark single
player performance and that multiplayer
is much more demanding and much more
different so the 7950 was within a
couple percentage points and the 660ti
looks like was within a couple percent
so in future I will continue to
benchmark battlefield 3 using
single-player and you guys will all like
it don't forget to subscribe to life
tech tips from on boxing's reviews and
other computer videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
