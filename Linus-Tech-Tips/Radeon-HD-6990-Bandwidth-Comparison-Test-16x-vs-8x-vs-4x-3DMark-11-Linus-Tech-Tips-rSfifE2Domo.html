where I took to GTX 580 s threw them on
the gigabyte g1 gorilla motherboard and
I tested in dual 16x mode in SLI and
dual 8x bandwidth mode in SLI I am going
to be taking an even higher and even
more demanding card the Radeon HD 6990
I'm going to be running it in a single
card configuration in a 16 X slot an 8 X
slot and finally a 4x lot to find out
what difference there is in terms of
performance I'll be using 3d mark 11
extreme preset now please note that the
extreme preset will not show as much of
a difference as one of the lower quality
presets such as the entry or performance
presets but what it does give us is a
more realistic real-world scenario
because most people are not going to be
using a 6990 to run quake 3 at 1024 by
768 so you're going to be turning up the
details you're going to be turning up
the res so that is the scenario that we
will be looking at something to bear in
mind before I get too far into my
testing here is that the top slot at 16
and the second slot at 8x are both
running off the PCI Express controller
integrated into the Sandy Bridge CPU on
this board which is clocked at 4.7
gigahertz by the way to eliminate any
CPU bottlenecking
or as much as possible the bottom slot
actually runs off of the chipset at 4x
speed so it has an additional
disadvantage that is not shared by the
top two slots so just bear that in mind
take the results with a bit of a grain
of salt but I don't have another
platform handy where I can show you 16 X
8 X + 4 X where they will all be equal
so my 16x result is a score of 3330 so
I'll be back with 8 X + 4 X results
shortly now this may look like a stupid
configuration I've got my 6990 and a GTX
580 here but the reason I've installed
the GTX 580 which won't affect my
benchmark scores in any way is to force
these PCIe lanes to go from 16 X - 8 X
so you can see here within gpu-z the
6990 reports as running at 16x and while
that may be true because it's running
internal crossfire where each CPU is
getting 16x bandwidth from the from the
lane splitter that's on the PCB itself
the actual lane splitter itself is only
getting if we look here at the GTX 580
so you can see that the actual bandwidth
to the slot is only 8 X because it is
correctly split at this time so my
benchmark results are 3312 3d marks so
we have seen a difference in performance
between 16 X and 8 X 3 3 1 2 very small
very small and I will be back with PCIe
4x results very shortly so at the end of
the day this video becomes more about
how if you internally bottleneck a card
according to the computational resources
located on the card that the amount of
PCI Express bandwidth you supply it with
is actually going to make very little
difference in terms of performance now
something to bear in mind too about this
particular testing setup today you can
see I had to nudge my motherboard over a
little bit to get the 6990 to fit into
that bottom slot on my tech station but
so I've got it in the PCIe 4x slot now
think about it this way basically I've
got two GPUs I have on a 69.95 2 6970
GPUs okay so so bear with me here so
by the comparison I did the other day
where I was comparing 16 X 16 X and 8 X
8 X SLI this is basically running it on
this motherboard this card in 16s mode
is pretty much like running two cards
too high in single GPUs at 8 X 8 X 4 X 4
X in the 8 X slot and then at 2 X 2 X in
that 4 X slot at the very bottom that
that's essentially the amount of
bandwidth we have available per GPU and
we still see very very little
fluctuation in terms of the overall
score so what I may have to do in the
coming next little while is do an
updated video about this where I find a
slightly less GPU speed bottlenecked
benchmark and demonstrate might be more
of a more of a typical or worst-case
scenario for how much the PCI Express
bandwidth affects single card
performance so thank you for checking
