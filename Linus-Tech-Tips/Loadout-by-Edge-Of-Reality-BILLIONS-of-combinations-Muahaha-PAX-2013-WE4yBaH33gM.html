brought to you by western digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys we're here at
the Indy mega booth checking out loadout
and as far as I can tell this game is
about insane amounts of customization
and just mad amounts of insanity is
there anything else you can add about
this game oh yeah well I mean that's
that's the basic thing yeah it's
completely mad so uh the big thing about
it other than that is that a lot of
player empowerment in terms of like
being able to invent your own weapons so
we've got a modular weapon crafting
system there's billions of combinations
you put pieces together and you invent
whatever weapon you can invent with the
pieces you got and there's some crazy
combinations out there really up to the
player play style and what you want to
do with your weapon and when he says
billions of combinations he isn't
exaggerating there are actually billions
of combinations so if you're the type of
person that wants to tinker with things
and make your own thing that's unique to
you you can actually do that with this
game you were describing something to me
yesterday which was a sniper rifle that
shot rockets that blew up and heal
people that's right yeah that's got
Kerry Wayne that when the key thing
there is you also put the proximity
detonator on it so that you can fire
sniper grenades across the level they
stick and then when people need healing
they can run by them and the proximity
timer goes off and it heals them in like
a cluster of flak now all of those
pieces are that's a like I just
described like eight different modules
that make one gun you could change any
of those like you could change it to
fire and now instead of being healing
it's an unfriendly surprise to the enemy
yeah it's that sort of thing there's no
classes and load out so you really
define your class by the weapons and
your play style which is very cool
because a lot of people like I just said
earlier a lot of people that like the
customization part being able to make
something is unique to them you can that
can be brought to the most ridiculous
degree in this game everything about
this game like I said earlier insanity
the amount of everything in this game is
insanity what's your favorite part about
this game is it the customisation ok so
the favorite my favorite part of the
game is the fact it because of the
customization you can play any role you
want so I am not good at the enclosed
fighting like I die a lot of the time so
I play more of a support role and I do
two things with that one is I've got a
healing gun that lets me stay at medium
range and heal people so I can stay out
of the battle but still heal and the
second thing I do is I like me in a
sneaky
Eric and so I've got a remote control
rocket that I can fire all the way
across the level and blow people up so
between those two I'm like this
interesting long-range medium-range
support guy and I don't ever have to get
into close quarters battles right now
I'm going to lose that's interesting
because a lot of people will complain in
games in like similar to this style that
say someone will go sniper and they find
they're not very helpful to the team
even though they might be whatever it
goes back and forth but that sniper
could shoot healing bullets we just at
that point in time he's now helpful it's
exactly yeah you in back you could even
have two weapons one's your sniper
headshot killing and the other is your
sniper healing and now you're this weird
sort of like combo sniper if that's the
role you want to play that your class
that you've made do it you know that
could very be very effective something
that you described to me yesterday again
was the guy that made the he would shoot
out grenade mines things that would
follow him around and then automatically
go on a laser target and that's and
that's part of the hell of balancing
this game we've had a great community we
can gather a lot of data on what they're
doing what's effective so we can balance
basically with their help one guy made
he made a laser-guided missile bouncing
missile so he put down see on the
missiles and then he would shoot out a
whole bunch of mall at once and then he
had like all these bouncing minions that
would follow him around the level and
then because he was on laser-guided
whenever he wanted somebody to die he
would just point a laser at them and all
the missiles would suddenly leave him
and jump on that guy and blow him up
which is pretty awesome strategy we had
to nerf it a little bit but it's still a
viable thing to do that's very cool and
it's nice to see that you guys are
actively responding to different things
that people are going to create because
you think balancing more simple games is
hard imagine having billions of
combinations and trying to balance that
so I definitely understand it's still in
beta correct we are currently in early
access so it's a closed beta early
access on Steam we're going to be going
open beta pretty soon here and of course
it packs we've been signing up a bunch
of people bring him right into the
closed beta so we can grow the community
that sounds good so if you guys want to
pick up load out check it out on Steam
try and get your early access if you
liked our coverage of load out if you
liked our coverage of the indie mega
booth if you liked our coverage of packs
