our vandalism project on the NCIX tech
tips studio now I've actually got my my
neighborhood vandal fixing up some of
his work here and you can see that we've
made a lot of progress since the last
one so before all we had was a couple of
bricks the gray background some tape
outlining the letters whereas now you
can see we've actually filled in a lot
of the different colors for the
background you've got these green
accents on here the lettering is all
filled in in multiple colors and right
now he's actually if you want to have a
look at what he's working on there he's
just working on touching up some of the
white highlights to give the characters
more more pop so next week he's going to
come back and put a tek-tips logo up
here and make some changes to the way
that the sides built because you can see
right now they just end at the edge of
the wall and we're gonna have some kind
of effect put in here so actually I'm
very pleased with the overall result and
I think the cameraman likes it too so
there's our latest in progress update
and I'll definitely give you more
updates once it's closer to completion
or done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
