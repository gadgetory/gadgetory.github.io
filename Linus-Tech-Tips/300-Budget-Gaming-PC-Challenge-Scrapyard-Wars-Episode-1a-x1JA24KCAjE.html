where Luke and I try to build the best
computers we can with a set of
guidelines and a fixed budget so this is
our first episode where I'm looking for
a lot of feedback from you guys about
what we can do to make these fun and
interesting in the future but for
today's challenge we are keeping it very
simple $300 cash the very best gaming
rig that we can build with a few rules
so number one is no monitor or other
peripherals required we only have to
build the tower no worker research can
be pre done so you can't like go on
websites or Craigslist and try to find
things before or in-between each
participant gets a total of eight hours
to actually find everything and then
four hours to build it tune it and
benchmark it cuz I'm not paying any
Overtown on this so we are staying
inside those guidelines no leveraging
friends social media contacts co-workers
or anything of that sort overclocking is
allowed we'll be measuring performance
of the machines using 3d mark firestrike
Tomb Raider 2013 and dirt three and
along with the new peripherals thing
it's just a tower that you need no
operating system or anything like that
so let's get to it shall we
retro floors
yeah yeah we know
you have exceeded your daily transaction
limit please take your receipt I see
declined okay then i'ma go inside I have
the cashola alright let's go shall we
good luck I should have known he'd never
fall for that I'm fairly sure he's going
to waste time going back to the office
I brought a laptop with me so I will
begin immediately I really hope it's
charged there's a store somewhere in
Vancouver
I think it's called reboot it's a
non-for-profit little store thing that
kind of refurbishes computers and sells
computers and does kind of cheap repairs
and stuff for people that need it and I
think if I can participate in this
contest and support a company that tries
to like they do really cheap computer
repairs and I know they try to like I
think they do some charity giving
computers to people and stuff if I can
help them out get a cheap computer from
them and participate in the contest then
that's doing many things well at once so
I'm gonna try and see if I can do that
I'm going to contact them figure what
their hours are and go from there now
we're rockin yeah Jesus
[Laughter]
all right so should we started on red
flag deals used to be used to be a haunt
for me I used to find a lot of good
stuff there the Linus tech tips buy sell
trade that Craigslist you want me to
call Anthony ah oh oh that no we're not
allowed to leverage friends and this is
where the like montage music has to come
in
don't don't buy a laptop
that might be the best we can do and
then this guy also had a hard drive for
20 bucks oh he likes it does he okay
good
excellent that means literally nothing
so an intel core2duo with 80 gigabyte
hard drive Oh God and two gigabytes of
RAM for 50 bucks though so it leaves me
$250 to get a guy off his card let me
give them a call
this is why we don't make TV shows there
seems to be a pretty significant drop in
price once you get to court you do
arrange so I'm looking for that because
I think that'll be fine for most of the
games it'll fall behind a bit for sure
on tomb raider are they gonna come to
concede defeat are they going they're
not allowed to take out more money oh
they're trying to film things better
than just pointing the camera at me in
the car cutsies
whoa this could be Oh is this that same
freakin guy well he has a case he has a
CX 500 power supply - if I hear back
from this guy I don't think Luke's gonna
think to check Kijiji okay 45 and then
this is a combo and then this is a combo
whoo computer cases with power supplies
and other hardware phone calls only
please all right here we go
hi hi you have a Craigslist listing for
computer cases with power supplies and
$10 or something so do you have anything
reasonably new with a 24-pin power
supply and compatibility for a micro ATX
board like some kind of standard board
or is it all gonna be non-standard like
Dell HP stuff that's an Athlon oh okay
that's a little older than I need I'm
looking for an entry level gaming PC if
you can just tell me what CPUs the
system's that you have I'm very familiar
with the ha I'm very familiar with the
hardware I know what I'm looking for I
just need to know what you have oh okay
that that might actually be very helpful
my name is Linus
what I'm trying to accomplish is today I
want to find my platform so everything
I'll need and then tomorrow essentially
I want to spend the entire time finding
the best possible price that I can on a
GPU it's like my whole plan tomorrow
pick up I I just found another computer
same price but it's actually five
dollars cheaper has a 450 watt power
supply that's probably fine 4 gigs of
ram so that's a slight improvement there
4 gigs around that's probably good
enough and then any 8400 again kind of
surprised he hasn't just tried to like
leave and go into some little computer
shop and get them to give him a deal
because of who he is
that was my full expectation the whole
time and then he put up the rule that we
can't use our influence I was like wow
because that's exactly what I expect
you're going to do mm-hmm so now I'm not
sure how he's gonna cheat I just know
that he's going to you know what we
should do is we should look really
excited when we pull out and and we
should look like we're heading somewhere
ok we'll give them a little little
farewell beep beep you know I don't even
know how to use Craigslist first stop is
going to be the Salvation Army thrift
store this isn't a computer
how was bad that was really bad
I hope lionesses time is not not going
better I just throw the car under us and
he will be ok we can afraid we could
afford judgement at the end of the at
the end of the contest when we have no
computer because there's no computers at
thrift shops and - magically found
something on Craigslist I'm hoping that
they don't have like computer savvy
employees so they might undervalue a
certain Tower compared to another one
like that my price to them at the same
price and one of them is actually
clearly better fingers crossed
is this literally a clothing store now
hi hi I'm actually contacting a few guys
that are selling computer parts may I
ask which one Dilbert
uh yeah that's right hi I'm just
generally looking for everything right
now I don't have any of the components
locked in and I need to get everything
by about midday tomorrow it's a birthday
present what would we be looking at for
something like a Q 6600 and a bored
still leaves me needing case power
supply do you have any like super cheap
Oh stupid stuff yeah case and power
supply
okay I'm not worried about the case
looking great he doesn't see real well
you know what look I will call you back
before the end of your shop time today
so I'll call you back in the next hour
or so and I'll let you know if I'm gonna
come by tomorrow morning and pick this
stuff up sounds like this might be the
deal that helps me out here all right
thank you very much
take care maybe it was worth while to
listen to that life story after all we
might have just gotten everything but a
video card with a hundred dollar budget
for a graphics card left over okay that
might be like plus tax
well let's hope it's not I got an email
back from the guy that I actually wanted
to respond the most this was the guy
with the 8,400 that had four gigabytes
of ddr3 as well and the 500 gigabyte
hard drive it's not the greatest price
but that's an option he's available
right now which is good so I need to
figure out if I can get a what I can get
for a graphics card for 220 bucks if I
can get something good enough which I
think I can I think I'll go with it -
mica
yes I did okay I got it I got to be
upfront with you
I can't leverage being me as a
negotiation strategy so you have to
pretend that I'm not who I am so I don't
need a water-cooled card I need an
air-cooled card which means that since I
I don't have any budget left over for
the rest of the system I pretty much
have to get an all-in-one liquid cooler
for $100 - whatever I pay for your card
so that's where I'm at I have got no
leads on an all-in-one liquid cooler and
I have to have this done by the end of
the day tomorrow is bear now Israel I
see that yeah can you do 80 okay
can I pick it up can I pick it up today
or tomorrow
can I come tomorrow morning you're in
Richmond correct you're in Burnaby I
think I'm gonna be in Burnaby anyway
like I'm doing a bit of I'm doing a bit
of computer hardware pick up stuff
tomorrow so I will be I'll be around so
tell you what why don't you just pick
somewhere somewhere safe near wherever
it is you live like a Starbucks or
whatever and then just let me let me
know you've got my number so if you just
text me the address and what time works
for you I'll be there tomorrow morning
okay all right thank you
that would be no problem all right take
care okay we have secured a GTX 580 for
$80 if they can get a slightly faster
CPU than us like maybe an 1155 core i5
quad core something along those lines
even if they have a slightly lesser
video card they might still come out
ahead if they get a similar video card
better CPU then we're in real trouble
but basically this is gonna I need to
make sure our power supply has support
for GTX 580 that's a pretty power hungry
card
hopefully spinning their wheels finding
nothing all right
so I got the computer everything works
he booted it up for me I got to inspect
everything it's fine
I didn't haggle him down anymore so I
got it for 80 bucks which i think is
fine we'll have to see what Linus got
but that seems like an okay deal for an
8400 computer to me the inside is really
nice and clean so I was happy to see
that it looks like he took good care of
it or at least took good care of it
right before I got there yeah not
entirely sure which one but anyways kind
of baller Ram I didn't expect of it okay
maybe not absolutely baller but it's
gold plated well not really gold plated
gold painted ocz memory which I thought
was kind of funny there's the e 8400 the
fan CPU fan and everything is in
immaculate condition which is great let
me get this back in here one quick
second I thought it was kind of funny
the optical drive isn't even hooked up
but I wouldn't use it anyway so the
power supply though is kind of like the
most sketchy balls thing ever it's a
power link 450 watt but yeah I don't
know
no PCIe power whatsoever there's two
molex as those so I can adapter off for
that so I don't know we're just gonna
have to see so this will be my base
platform I'll see if I need to get a new
power supply and then
yeah this is really awkward because I've
just made appointments with our GTX 580
water-cooled card and our cooler for it
which are totaling $100 but someone just
accepted our offer for $100 on a 79 50
so I'm gonna do a little bit of research
into overclocking the 580 and
overclocking the 7950 but I'm gonna feel
like a real bad dude but I might have to
bail on those guys and take the better
offer the problem is that now I have to
go get it tonight which means I might
have to take like the kids with me so
save on select Intel Core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more so did we decide
about going to get things tonight I
can't well that's very interesting then
I have a call to make
I'm not cheating replying to a message
there wasn't okay I had to I had no I
had to do other stuff I've been back
here for a bit I had to like record a
voiceover and stuff no have I been here
have I been working Wow
dicks sorry I can't come down to get
anything tonight so I might have to pass
if anything changes I will I will give a
call tomorrow to to let you know if it
comes to that then if it's not too much
to ask maybe take the card out with you
and I could come to you wherever you
happen to be because it's a bit of a
scavenger hunt situation I've got going
on
Thanks my number is 3 10 10 10 Pizza Hut
good night there I'm done for the night
there it's all I'm doing tonight
next time on scrapyard wars linus gets a
tetanus shot Luke gets mugged and Nick
fights a demon God none of that actually
happens or does it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
