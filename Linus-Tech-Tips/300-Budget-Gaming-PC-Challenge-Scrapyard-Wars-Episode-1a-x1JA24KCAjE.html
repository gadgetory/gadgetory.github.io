where Luke and I try to build the best
computers we can with a set of
guidelines and a fixed budget so this is
our first episode we are looking for a
lot of feedback from you guys about what
we can do to make these fun and
interesting in the future but for
today's challenge we are keeping it very
simple $300 cash the very best gaming
rig that we can build with a few rules
so number one is no monitor or other
peripherals required we only have to
build the tower no worker research can
be pre done so you can't like go on
websites or Craigslist and try to find
things before or in between each
participant gets a total of eight hours
to actually find everything and then
four hours to build it tune it and
benchmark it cuz I'm not paying any
overtime on this so we are staying
inside those guidelines no leveraging
friends social media contacts co-workers
or anything of that sort overclocking is
allowed we'll be measuring performance
of the machines using 3d mark firestrike
to Radar 2013 and dirt3 and along with
the no peripherals thing it's just a
tower that you need no operating system
or anything like that
so let's get to it shall we red mark
yours
yeah here we go
you have exceeded your daily transaction
limit please take your receipt I see
declined um okay then I'm go inside I
have the cashola here you are thank you
alright
let's go shall we good luck I should
have known he'd never fall for that I'm
fairly sure he's going to waste time
going back to the office
I brought a laptop with me so I will
begin immediately I really hope it's
charged there's a store somewhere in
Vancouver
I think it's called reboot it's a
non-for-profit little store thing that
kind of refurbishes computers and sells
computers and does kind of cheap repairs
and stuff for people that need it and I
think if I can participate in this
contest and support a company that tries
to like they do really cheap computer
repairs and I know they try to like I
think they do some charity giving
computers to people and stuff if I can
help them out get a cheap computer from
them and participate in the contest then
that's doing many things well at once so
I'm going to try and see if I can do
that I'm going to contact them figure
what their hours are and go from there
now we're rocking yeah Jesus
all right so should we start on red flag
deals used to be used to be a haunt for
me I used to find a lot of good stuff
there the Linus tech tips buy sell trade
that Craigslist you want me to call
Anthony ah oh that no we're not allowed
to leverage friends this is where the
like montage music has to come in
don't down down down apply a laptop
that might be the best we can do and
then this guy also had a hard drive for
20 bucks oh he likes the Jathan does he
okay good
excellent that means literally nothing
so an intel core2duo with 80 gigabyte
hard drive Oh God and two gigabytes of
RAM for 50 bucks though so it leaves me
$250 to get a graphics card
let me give them a call
this is why we don't make TV shows there
seems to be a pretty significant drop in
price once you get to Core 2 Duo range
so I'm looking for that because I think
that'll be fine for most of the games
it'll fall behind a bit for sure on tomb
raider are they gonna come to concede
defeat are they going they're not
allowed to take out more money oh
they're trying to film things better
than just pointing the camera at me in
the car having a vapor hat seems
unnecessary whoa this could be oh this
is that same friggin guy well he has a
case he has a CX 500 power supply - if I
hear back from this guy I don't think
Lou's gonna think to check Kijiji okay
45 and then this is a combo and then
this is a combo whoo computer cases with
power supplies and other hardware phone
calls only please all right here we go
hi hi you have a craigslist listing for
computer cases with power supplies and
$10 or something so do you have anything
reasonably new with a 24-pin power
supply and compatibility for a micro ATX
board like some kind of standard board
or is it all going to be non-standard
like Dell HP stuff that's an Athlon oh
okay
that's a little older than I need I'm
looking for an entry level gaming PC if
you can just tell me what CPUs the
system's that you have I'm very familiar
with the I'm very familiar with the
hardware I know what I'm looking for I
just need to know what you have I can't
comment oh okay that that might actually
be very helpful my name is Linus
Gaming power program you need the you
need a motherboard you need fun
processor but you realized what I'm
trying to accomplish is today I want to
find my platform so everything I'll need
and then tomorrow essentially I want to
spend the entire time finding the best
possible price that I can on a GPU
that's like my whole plan tomorrow pick
up I just found another computer same
price but it's actually five dollars
cheaper as a 450 watt power supply
that's probably fine 4 gigs of ram so
that's a slight improvement there 4 gigs
around that's probably good enough and
then any 8400 again kind of surprised he
hasn't just tried to like leave and go
into some little computer shop and get
them to give him a deal because of who
he is
that was my full expectation the whole
time and then he put up the rule that we
can't use our influence I was like wow
because that's exactly what I expected
me to do so now I'm not sure how he's
going to cheat I just know that he's
going to I never cheat at all you know
what we should do is we should look
really excited when we pull out and and
we should look like we're heading
somewhere ok we'll give them a little
little farewell beat beat you know
I don't even know how to use Craigslist
first stop is going to be the Salvation
Army thrift store this isn't a computer
I'm screwed that was bad
that was really bad I hope minuses time
is not not going better
NASA fetes throw the car under a semi
we'll be okay we can avoid we should
avoid judgment at the end of the at the
end of the contest when we have no
computer because there's no computers at
thrift shops and - magically found
something on Craigslist I'm hoping that
they don't have like computer savvy
employees so they might undervalue a
certain tower compared to another one
like they might price two of them at the
same price and one of them is actually
clearly better fingers crossed
is this literally a clothing store now
hi hi I'm actually contacting a few guys
that are selling computer parts may I
ask which one Gilbert uh yeah that's
right
hi I'm just generally looking for
everything right now I don't have any of
the components locked in and I need to
get everything by about midday tomorrow
it's a birthday present what would we be
looking at for something like a Q 6600
and a board Oh still leaves me needing a
case power supply do you have any like
super chief Oh stupid stuff
yeah case and power supply okay I'm not
worried about the case looking great he
doesn't see real well well I can throw
the plain cake thank you for the 200 um
you know what look I will call you back
before the end of your shock time today
so I'll call you back in the next hour
so and I'll let you know if I'm gonna
come by tomorrow morning and pick this
stuff up
sounds like this might be the deal that
helps me out here all right thank you
very much
take care maybe it was worthwhile to
listen to that life story after all we
might have just gotten everything but a
video card with $100 budget for a
graphics card left over okay that might
be like plus tags cuz this is oh well
let's hope it's not I got an email back
from the guy that I actually wanted to
respond the most this was the guy with
the 8,400 that had four gigabytes of
ddr3 as well and the 500 you buy hard
drive it's not the greatest price but
that's an option
he's available right now which is good
so I need to figure out if I can get a
what I can get for a graphics card for
220 bucks if I can get something good
enough which I think I can I think I'll
go with it
- speaking
yes I did oh okay I got it I got to be
upfront with you
I can't leverage being me as a
negotiation strategy so you have to
pretend that I'm not who I am
so I don't need a water cooled card I
need an air cooled card which means that
since I I don't have any budget left
over for the rest of the system I pretty
much have to get an all-in-one liquid
cooler for $100 - whatever I pay for
your card so that's where I'm at I have
got no leads on an all-in-one liquid
cooler and I have to have this done by
the end of the day tomorrow is there now
Israel yes there's the one guy with the
$20 on medically for the 580 I see that
because that would be just like an extra
dog like 20 bucks on top of my card
right yeah can you do 80 oh sure yeah I
guess I could yeah okay can I pick it up
uh can I pick it up today or tomorrow
can I come tomorrow morning uh you're in
Richmond correct actually you're in
Burnaby yeah you mean like we're working
you mean actually I think I'm gonna be
in Burnaby anyway like I'm doing a bit
of a I'm doing a bit of computer
hardware pick up stuff tomorrow so I
will be I'll be around so tell you what
why don't you just pick somewhere
somewhere safe near wherever it is you
live like a Starbucks or whatever and
then just let let me know you've got my
number so if you just text me the
address and what time works for you I'll
be there tomorrow morning
sure okay all right thank you
just wondering that would be no problem
all right all right take care
okay we have secured a GTX 580 for $80
if they can get a slightly faster CPU
than us like maybe an 1155 core i5 quad
core something along those lines even if
they have a slightly lesser video card
they might still come out ahead if they
get a similar video card better CPU then
we're in real trouble but basically this
is going to I need to make sure our
power supply has support for GTX 580
that's a pretty power hungry card
hopefully spinning their wheels finding
nothing all right
so I got the computer everything works
you booted it up for me I got to inspect
everything it's fine
I didn't haggle him down anymore so I
got it for 80 bucks which i think is
fine walk to see what Linus got but that
seems like an okay deal for an 8400
computer to me the inside is really nice
and clean so I was happy to see that
looks like he took good care of it or at
least put good care of it right before I
got there yeah not entirely sure which
one but anyways kind of baller Ram I
didn't expect it ok maybe not actually
baller but it's gold plated well not
really gold plated gold painted ocz
memory which I thought was kind of funny
there's the e 8400 the fan CPU fan and
everything is in immaculate condition
which is great let me get this back in
here one quick second thought it was
kind of funny the optical drive isn't
even hooked up but I wouldn't use it
anyways so the power supply though is
kind of like the most sketchy balls
thing ever it's a power link 450 watt
but yeah I don't know
no PCIe power whatsoever there's two
molex as those so I can adapter off for
that so
we'll just gonna have to see so this
will be my base platform I'll see if I
need to get a new power supply and then
yeah we'll go from there
this is really awkward because I've just
made appointments with our GTX 580
water-cooled card and our cooler for it
which are totaling $100 but someone just
accepted our offer for $100 on a 79 50
so I'm gonna do a little bit of research
into overclocking the 580 and
overclocking the 7950 but I'm gonna feel
like a real bad dude but I might have to
bail on those guys and take the better
offer the problem is that now I have to
go get it
tonight which means I might have to take
like the kids with me so save on select
intel core i7 processors and 730 series
SSDs with instant rebates during
Valentine's week February 14th to 21st
2015
click now to learn more so did we decide
about going to get things tonight I
can't well that's very interesting then
I have a call to make also you can't do
any more Craigslist thing stuff you have
for 6 I'm not cheating right now
replying to a message there was it ok I
had to I had no I had to do other stuff
I've been back here for a bit I had to
like record a voiceover and stuff no
have I been here have I been working is
there is there actually I don't know oh
wow
dicks - turns got that big 4k monitor
can I have that now this isn't worth it
that's not 4k oh sorry I can't come down
to get anything tonight so I might have
to pass if anything changes I will I
will give a call tomorrow to to let you
know if it comes to that then if it's
not too much to ask maybe take the card
out with you and I could come to
wherever you happen to be because it's a
bit of a scavenger hunt situation I've
got going on
Thanks my number is 3 10 10 10 Pizza Hut
good night
there I'm done for the night they're
tall I'm doing tonight
next time on scrapyard wards Linus gets
a tetanus shot Luke gets mugged and Nick
fights a demon oh you bloody ding God
