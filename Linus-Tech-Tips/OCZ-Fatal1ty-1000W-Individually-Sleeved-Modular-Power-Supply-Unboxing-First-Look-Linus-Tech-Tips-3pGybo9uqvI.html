very high-end product with the Jonathan
fatality Wendell branding so we've seen
our fair share of fatality products that
the positioning is like yeah they're
pretty good but they're a little bit
expensive for what they deliver or they
don't do anything particularly
differently from their competitors such
as you know remember the old Zelman
fatality heat sinks where the fatality
one had a red LED instead of a blue LED
and it costs significantly more well
this fatality product is a legitimately
awesome product of its own right and it
just happens to have the Jonathan
fatality branding which I mean doesn't
actually look that bad because this is
like a cool logo and red as long as it
goes with your color scheme is pretty
good it wouldn't fit with my system
because I'm going for a blue and black
color scheme but if you have a red color
scheme or no color scheme at all then
this should work pretty well say for
example if you have a republic of gamers
motherboard actually before we open it
up let's get into what exactly is going
on with this product so one is it is a
1000 watt power supply it is modular
although not fully modular so I'll show
you what that means once we open it up
it has a 5-year ocz power swap warranty
which basically means as a five year
warranty it's 80 plus gold and according
to oh here here's on the side so if you
guys want to know the absolute goods as
far as power supply performance goes
maybe not subjectivity maybe not you
know the look or whatever else but
that's less important when it comes to
power supplies check out Johnny guru com
they do the best power supply reviews by
far according to them the performance of
this unit is outstanding and it does
meet the 80 plus gold certification so a
lot of the times in fact huh a funny
story I don't not going to name any
names but one company submitted a power
supply I believe this was back when 80
plus silver was like the sexy
certification and they submitted it to
the 80-plus organization with shorter
cables then the actual retail unit had
and that little bit of extra a little
bit
extra resistance and the longer cables
was enough to knock it out of 80 plus
silver but they got the certification
even though the unit they delivered to
market wasn't actually 80 plus silver so
this one is actually a plus cool what
else we got here continuous output rated
at a demanding 50cm bein temperature
though the hundred percent Japanese low
ESR and 105 degrees centigrade
capacitors single 12 volt rail which
means that you can easily plug things in
wherever which way you want without
worrying about any over over current
protections compliant the latest ATX
standard large temperature controlled
load temperature and load controlled 1
40 millimeter double ball bearing fan
with a red LED 80 plus gold ok active
power factor correction and better have
it if it's a high end power supply these
days heavy duty protection circuitry ok
carib queda ok five your power so
extremely cool and quiet yeah let's go
ahead and open this up I'm actually
really excited about this product
because it is the first to market with
individually sleeved cables out of the
box so yeah it's a little over 200 bucks
so it's not cheap this is not a cheap
power supply but it is a 1000 watt power
supply it is 80 plus gold it is modular
and it has individually sleeved cables
now individually sleeved cables whether
you believe that is a selling point or a
disadvantage is up to you personally I
believe it's a selling point I think it
looks slick I think that as far as a
value proposition goes when you compare
this power supply to one that doesn't
have individually sleeved cables but
maybe has a kit available like with
corsair or if you use those up here let
me see if I can find one I should have
hope sorry I should have one lying
around with it yes there we go or if you
buy these extension cables in order to
you know hide the not individually
sleeved part of your cable and then you
know wrap this around where you actually
see it that is going to add up pretty
quickly in terms of the cost of your
power supply so you would be better off
to buy the one that already comes with
it and presents a good value by doing so
now the disadvantage of individually
sleeved cables is they do make the
cables quite a bit bulkier so these are
here there we go so this is what
individually sleeved cables love bear
actually using a very reasonable quality
sleeping on here i'd say the heat shrink
might be a touch on the long side but
it's not the end of the world here's
what but here's what they look like so
yeah
decide whether that aesthetic is for you
sorry when that's plugged in then it
actually won't move at all and you can
you can you'll have to you'll want to
cut these off and then get things
arranged really nice get them running
really flat behind your motherboard so
they do make them bulkier but i believe
where you see them they actually look a
lot sharper especially in places like
graphics cards where you can run the
individually sleeve cables you know they
plug into your graphics card like this
and then you have them you know wrapped
out like that it's better than seeing
any color you don't want to see any
color to the cables and these these
definitely prevent that from happening
another cool thing about the
individually sleeve cables is if you're
running one that takes an 8th and a 6
pin you go ahead you just clip this off
take these to run them somewhere else
entirely and you don't have to have that
extra two cables are that extra two pins
just kind of randomly hanging off of
your video card comes with a beefy power
cable comes with few black zip ties as
well as for black screws for installing
your power supply I did not mention the
instruction manual but there you go it
also comes in a little fatality wendell
plastic and you know paper bag and comes
with modular cables so right this is a
setting modular power supply not fully
modular which means that it has some
cables pre-attached and some that come
in a baggie and look like this so let's
go through the pre-attached ones first
the pre-attached ones are your 24 pin
cable which looks like this next you've
got a 4 plus 4 so that is an 8-pin
connector for your motherboard next you
have two PCIe 6 plus 2 pins so you have
everything you need if basically if you
are buying a 1000 watt power supply and
you are not using at least these four
cables you're probably doing it wrong so
I have no problem with them attaching
these cables although you see some semi
modular power supplies as i like to call
them that have like a bunch of weird
stuff attached like i have one semi
modular power supply that has 28 pins
and a 4-pin cpu connector all
permanently
to the power supplies ridiculous I mean
what kind of system are you installing
an 850 watt power supply in that needs
three CPU connectors because you're
using a server motherboard so soft stuff
like that I would like to see it be
fully modular rather than pre attached
to the power supply now let's have a
look at what we have in terms of modular
cables so let's find all of our saitta
then we got to helping them you get some
bollocks we got space yeah II got some
more piece yet we got another 8-pin CPU
and then we have a couple of molex too
floppy adapter doodads look even those
look sharp look it up it's fantastic I
love it not everyone does but I do so
let's have a look at our SATA cable
these again individually sleeve they
look thin tasmac so they got four
connectors on each of our three cables
let's just make sure they will still
have four yes they do yes they do you
can see how sharp these look very nicely
terminated in there you can see they've
actually put the heat shrink on from
what I can tell purely for decoration
because these SATA connectors bite right
into the wire so they probably just are
running a single continuous piece of
sleeve all the way down the the
individual wire here and then just just
putting these on for looks because you
can see this leading actually runs right
right through which makes them very very
very sharp looking and that is the
reason why someone might want to buy an
individually sleeved power supply so the
next one we've got here is our 8-pin cpu
connector so we've got another one of
these so this guy will plug in right
about here okay that matches the other
one so if you did happen to have a power
supply that needs a couple of eight pin
connectors you would be covered and the
power supply does have enough excuse me
well those are kind of tight there we go
does have enough modular connectors for
up to okay remember we've got to six
plus two PCIe form or six plus two PCIe
for up to three way 3-way SLI or
crossfire then we have another one for
the 4-pin CPU as well as the
pre-attached one so
8-pin CPU some pre types one we can have
up to two of those and then up to five
peripheral connectors so that is the
Sato ones as well as the molex one so
molex wise we have two of those each
with four four pin peripheral connectors
once again these are terminated very
very cleanly you can see they're
actually using black wires as well so
that's why you can't see any color
whatsoever through the cables and
finally let's have a look at the PCI
Express cables that are included so
length on these looks pretty good you
can see that they've put these little
these little zip ties on all of them
just to help you I guess to help you
route them the first time around
personally I just take them all off and
then just do as clean a job as I can of
routing the cables they look really
really sharp when you get them sort of
tucked away just right so that you get a
nice bundle coming out of whatever
component that they have to happen to be
plugged into looks really really really
nice so we've got four of those as well
so you can plug in all of the modular
cables that come with the power supply
but you don't have to because it's
modular so let's have a look at the
aesthetic of the unit so there you got
your silhouette of Jonathan Wendell I
think that picture was taken like eight
years ago but he still looks pretty
similar I ran into him at CES last year
thousand watt power supply ocz
technology all pretty standard fare got
a little fatality logo going on here as
well as one hundred and forty millimeter
red LED lit fan you can see how nice
touch actually hey like that even the
PCB inside is red can you see that down
at the bottom rib PCB down at the bottom
oh yeah there you go okay mariya you can
see correctly oriented they also have
the fatality logo over here so you can
see if I turn around this way it's
upside down that means that leather your
case mounts the power supply on the top
or the bottom your logo will be correct
side up very nice finally we got yet
another sort of fatality looking logo
here there's the close-up of the modular
interface and then at the back we're
gonna find things look pretty standard
with the honeycomb grille as well as a
nice big on and off switch and our power
in overall spec of the unit you can see
it can deliver up to 990 6 watts of its
total 100 1000 watts of continuous power
on the 12 volt rail
which means no matter what you load this
thing up with unless you are sucking
more than 110 watts from the wall you're
pretty much not going to run into any
difficulty let me tell you making a
configuration like that wouldn't be easy
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the fatality
1000 watt 80 plus gold power supply with
the individually sleeved cables which I
personally think is a huge selling point
although not everyone might agree but I
think it's awesome and don't forget to
