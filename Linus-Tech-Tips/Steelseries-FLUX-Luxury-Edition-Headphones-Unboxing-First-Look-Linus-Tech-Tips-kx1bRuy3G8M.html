the SteelSeries flux luxury Edition dun
dun da so SteelSeries is becoming more
and more focused I mean like okay I
talked about this again and again and
again I love the 7h it's a gaming
headset that's actually legitimately not
just good for like you know rattling
your skull because it's an actual audio
headphone aside from being a headset so
they're becoming more and more about
different kinds of audio solutions so
this is their mobile audio sort of their
mobile headphone although it's
SteelSeries so it's got a mic included
with it anyway just in case you wanted
to use it with your phone or your well
your phone or your computer or whatever
else you want to actually use it for I
don't know Skype calls or anything like
that so it does have an integrated
microphone but it's mostly for the the
out-and-about experience listening to
music these guys have 40 millimeter
drivers which means that you can expect
them to actually be able to deliver some
bass in spite of the very very
lightweight sort of construction and I'm
just gonna open it up like the
headphones that you can buy at your
local big box store that are sort of
overpriced and sort of you know look
nice but actually sound like crap they
look nice so my expectation for a
product like this from SteelSeries from
a brand that I actually trust unlike
sort of no-name brand on the shelf at
you know Best Buy or wherever else is
that besides being sort of that fashion
statement lightweight mobile headphone
it'll actually sound decent as well so I
haven't tried them yet although I will
before the Sun box things over but first
I want to show you guys what we have in
terms of accessories included so the
cables are a stylish orange although
what's cool is you can configure it the
way you want if you order from their
webshop so you can actually swap out
things like the courts the side plates
on the headphones themselves so you can
swap these out and you can even swap out
the Christians they're actually made to
order so severe
so the luxury edition like I said comes
with an orange cord so this one right
here you can see includes a microphone
and plugs into the bottom with a
detachable cable so you just plug that
guy in right there and there you have it
the other one that's included is a
straight four pole to hold on just a
gosh darn minute we'll be back in a
moment and we're back so sorry about
that I did get a little bit confused
it's very straight forward so in line is
a single button with a microphone for
the one that is 4-pole for your phone so
that single button can do a number of
things that can answer calls play pause
depending on your phone it can do things
like pressing it multiple times for fast
forward or rewind or whatever else this
one right here with the split connectors
plugs in here and whatever it plugs in
there and then has two separate prongs
for your for your input and your outputs
for your mic and your headphones
this right here is it just an included
three-and-a-half inch extension cable
because the PC one is not actually
necessarily an appropriate length to
reach onto the back of your computer so
you can just go ahead and plug these in
here in order to make sure that you can
actually reach the back of your PC so
that's all fine and good now let's get
into some of the really cool features so
this is this is awesome so their whole
marketing thing for this is go flux
yourself which is I think amazing so it
shows you all the different
customizability that you can so there's
all the different cable colors and
headphone colors and your muff colors
and all that good stuff okay really neat
stuff number one is padding wise so
these are just rubber pads now my
initial impression when I put them on
was oh yeah these these seem like
they're optimized for someone with more
of a square head like they sit kind of
flat on the top of my head and then they
don't they don't really hug the shape of
my head there's a reason for that all
you do is you take the flux and you
gently bend them and you go kind of 1:1
bend at a time and you are able to even
that's better already you're actually
able to change the shape of the headband
to get it to fit you just right which
means that while it doesn't have a soft
cushiony padding it does have soft
rubber and if the shape is perfect on
your head it's actually not a bad
experience the next thing check this out
so you've actually got two three and a
half millimeter jacks when I first saw
that I got a little bit confused but
once I sort of encountered this little
manual rate diagram right here that
shows no it's not for two different
input sources it is for okay you guys
you guys are gonna love this if you and
if you have a friend who also has a pair
of headphones and you want to sit on the
bus and share the same music or you want
to sit and watch a movie together on a
tablet or something like that guys if
you have a girlfriend then you know that
this stuff happens if you don't have a
girlfriend and you're probably watching
this video right now instead of spending
time with her sorry that's mean you can
actually output to a second set of
headphones it's just a standard
three-and-a-half millimeter steel series
hasn't built in any proprietary
connectors or anything like that so you
can easily use the flux headphones to
share your content with someone else at
the same time so input here output there
very very cool feature love it I also
haven't shown the carrying case yet so
there's just a little like nice carry
bag that you can put the flux headphones
inside and they also include these are
magnetic replacements for the stock ones
that come with it so you can actually
put black ones on and you can swap them
out to something else later on down the
line if you'd like but I personally like
the ones that come with the luxury
Edition here they do fold so there you
go you can just fold them up like well
like that apparently put them in there
and I think that pretty much covers it I
think I mentioned the forty millimeter
drivers I think I mentioned the travel
friendliness detachable cables nothing
proprietary I mean for me the killer app
is being able to customize the fit the
fact that they aren't like sort of just
those stupid fashion headphones that so
they're actually worth a couple bucks
compared to what you normally buy in
this kind of a category oh yeah I
haven't shown the sort of the softness
of the ear cups at all so there's that
and being able to share my music or my
movie or whatever else it happens to be
with someone is the killer app for me
that is outstanding thank you for
