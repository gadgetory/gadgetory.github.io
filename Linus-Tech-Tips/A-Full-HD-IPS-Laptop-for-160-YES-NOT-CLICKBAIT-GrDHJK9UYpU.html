of commodity hardware really blows me
away with its pricing the last time it
happened with a notebook was the Acer
Helios 300 and at $1100 one of its whoa
big selling points was a 1080p IPS
display well this year fusion five
laptop also has a full HD IPS display
but for only a hundred and sixty bucks
Tunnel bear fur teams makes it easy to
secure your Wi-Fi on any network and
comes with priority support and easy
team management try it for free at the
link below unboxing the fusion five my
initial impressions I was actually
pretty impressed the build quality is
not amazing or anything but the i/o is
adequate with two USB type a full-size
ports though full size SD and HDMI would
have been nice but for a hundred and
sixty bucks like this thing has a full
version of Windows 10 for a hundred and
sixty dollars damn anyway yeah so for
the price the plastics feel okay the
screen is rigid enough and the bottom
half of the clamshell is pretty okay too
even if it rattles enough that you could
offer it to a bandmate who forgot our
snare drum that day and that's before we
get to the real star of the show here
the screen hours did come with a dead
pixel but aside from that I'd consider
it stunning for the money compared to
our $200 Dell laptop the screen on the
fusion 5 is in a whole other League the
blacks are blacker the whites are whiter
the colors are color and the viewing
angles are angler however we may have a
small problem here can the fusion 5 even
playback 1080p content rockin an Intel
Atom quad core 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of emmc storage this laptop plows
through tasks like a plow but not that
plow this plow I mean to be clear it can
do stuff and even delivers smooth
playback with high bitrate HD web
content like that found on floatplane
club first root core and the screen
folds out 180 degrees for easy viewing
so if you're looking for a cheap little
machine to watch YouTube and Netflix on
it's actually pretty compelling if
you're looking to do much of anything
else you probably want to stay the hell
away
first of all you will need headphones
for watching videos since the speakers
are worse than a mid-grade smartphone
and video calls no with this webcam you
won't have a good side but really Linus
a bad webcam that's your deal-breaker
oh ho no the real deal breakers come
when you start trying to use it for any
kind of productivity for starters typing
on the fusion five laptop is a slog the
keys are spaced so close together the
tactile feel is best described as damp
and adding insult to injury keystrokes
don't always register making typing even
this simple paragraph a churn see do you
see what I'm talking about
and these problems also mean that you'll
be regularly reaching for the backspace
key conveniently located right
underneath the power button I mean don't
worry you can turn off tap to sleep but
like then why even have a power button
now Alex normally writes an entire
laptop review on that laptop to get a
really good feel for what it's like to
work on it but this is the first time
that the device is rubbish keyboard and
wicked case of narcolepsy forced him to
give up and having used it myself for a
little while I admire that he even got
this far now you could say yeah but
Linus that little handheld thing you
checked out recently had a bad keyboard
too but yeah it had super pocketable
portability on its side
and it still gets worse I mean moving
down from the keyboard there's this
really small trackpad which is only part
of the problem because the fact that
it's finished in the same way as the
wrist rest means that there's very
little noticeable feel when you move
outside of its bounds something that's
frustrating it's noticeably laggy but
then that's hardly even the worst issue
when it regularly registers a single
click as to
or even three and clicking-and-dragging
to highlight words or resize windows is
an exercise in futility it cools it and
unfortunately or fortunately if you like
ranty reviews of terrible products the
problems don't stop there while we were
charging the device the battery got
hotter than the creamy melted center of
a delicious hot pocket that you know
what kind of hungry I'll be right back
sorry that's better
oh not hot but here's a positive point
the left side of the keyboard gets so
toasted during youth there you can
actually use it to keep this warm in
between bites more bad stuff though the
battery life is ok but the power supply
that's included is so weak that when
using the laptop while plugged in it
actually slowly loses charge if you're
doing anything too intensive and it
takes over five hours of it being
plugged in and powered off to fully
charge so in a nutshell I'm encouraged
by the fusion five I mean sure it's a
bad experience and you shouldn't buy it
but I like the prospect of in the coming
years uh starting to see some really
impressive screens trickling down into
budget options like it oh hey no way
we're doing a spot for the Corsair one
it's the fast quiet and compact gaming
PC from Corsair it's built with premium
bead blasted aluminum and highlighted by
subtle ambient lighting effects it's
powered by an Intel Core i7 7700
processor and runs GeForce GTX graphics
from MSI the base model is air-cooled
while the rest are actually liquid
cooled and it uses standard sized
components to enable the user to upgrade
it in the future
it's quiet producing just 20 decibels at
idle and you can learn more and buy one
for yourself at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you disliked this video you can hit
that button I don't have any of these in
years but you liked it you can hit that
like button get subscribed maybe check
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also linked in the description is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join why they're hot
though when you uh from RAL Mecca with
for starters typing on the fusion five
laptop is a slog shut up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
