RGB one man risks it all to show five of
the most insane cases that money can buy
and it's brought to you by I fix it I
fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics
repair challenge visit ifixit.com
forward slash linus at the link below to
get yours today
okay don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan
of the understated monochrome aesthetic
with maybe a sprinkle of color here or
there but today today is about the
outliers the biggest the boldest and
arguably subjectively the beautifulest
monstrosities that you can actually buy
for your next PC build so no one offs
let's kick things off with the deep cool
Oh try stellar to make something truly
unique you basically need to step out of
the standard form factor I mean all
boxes look somewhat alike do they not so
deep cool amongst others here today took
that challenge very seriously as the
name implies the Tri stellar has three
isolated chambers arranged in sort of an
arrowhead style with a metal hub in the
middle that serves to route cables
between the compartments the exterior
panels have a rough kind of like
gunmetal finish that gives them a very
industrial look and feel and they just
slide off whenever you need to perform
maintenance so each chamber holds
something different so starting at the
top you've got mounting for your GPU via
a PCI Express extension and up to three
SSDs with some sexy tempered glass to
show them all off then the left chamber
holds your power supply an optional two
hard drives and a five and a quarter
inch bay if you still live in 2005
finally the last compartment contains an
ITX motherboard with either a
low-profile CPU cooler or a single 120
millimeter liquid cooler thanks to this
fan mount now each of the wings comes
with a 90 millimeter fan in the front
and is designed to act like a mini wind
tunnel so I would probably stick with a
blower style GPU cooler in this case
that is if you can afford one it is 350
bucks now for our next trick the
thermaltake tower 900 may actually not
feature an overly unique form factor but
it's still more than earns it's insane
designation thanks to the sheer
magnitude of both its capacity and size
which are sort of the same thing this
thing is so big that my wife can
literally fit inside of it with the
motherboard tray removed I couldn't make
this stuff up anyway
the white version that we have here in
the office has a powder-coated steel
exterior and more tempered glass then
you have probably ever seen on a single
case at least for now and this robust
construction lends to its over 50 pound
dry weight I mean you seriously need two
people to move this thing around once
it's full of hardware lots and lots of
hardware the Tower 900 can hold 2 quad
140 millimeter extra thick radiators
like what we've got here and even has
adequate room for fans on both sides of
it if you're a total airflow nut the
motherboard tray fits up to an e ATX
board and quad GPUs although that last
ones not really a thing anymore at least
for gamers and surprisingly the 900
actually costs barely more than it
weighs at 220 dollars following in the
size matters footsteps of our last case
is the also by Thermaltake core p7 now
in its default form here you can see it
just looks like one of those fancy
showcase cases that's just kind of like
a slab of metal that you put a bunch of
stuff on and then a tempered glass cover
in front for effect but no my friends
this case has much more to offer it can
be upright like a test bench it can be
on the wall or in its final form which
we're calling panoramic mode you just
install these extra included panels and
the case turns into this crazy open
concept set
thing that you can you can choose for
different angles for depending on what
you like to change the look of your case
and your bill I mean customization is
king right
the p7 also has a ton of radiator
mounting let's face for three quad 120
millimeter radiators in panoramic mode
here and you can even vertically mount
your GPUs yes that is GPUs plural but if
water cooling or our fancy GPU mounting
isn't really your thing the case also
has plenty to offer for normal people
with space for up to eight hard drives
or SSDs and of course like the tower
nine hundred full e ATX board
compatibility this one will cost you 300
bucks
alright so you've likely seen part one
of our course err slate build and don't
worry we will be finishing that up soon
TM but the slate fit our insanity
descriptor so well that we needed to
include it here and I know it's
fundamentally just a big black box but
what makes this case crazy is the
ridiculous amount of tempered glass this
glass it's gonna be huge
it's curved and you won't even believe
it and it's no slouch when it comes to
hardware capacity either in fact it has
the most capacity out of any case we've
looked at so far the most you can mount
eight SSDs five hard drives five
graphics cards two motherboards two
power supplies to quadruple 120
millimeter radiators a triple 140
millimeter radiator and 24 fans to cool
it all off oh and did I mention that it
has RGB front i/o because yeah it has
RGB front i/o now sadly this 40 pound
behemoth is not on the market yet but we
are hoping to see it sometime soon and
hopefully for under 500 bucks because
damn it Corsair the world needs this
bringing us to our final case
but okay the most insane case nay the
most insane thing I think I have ever
seen meet the Zadok 511 Helicarrier we
aren't sure how many of them exist or
how many will be made but it is
technically a production model and
therefore qualifies for this video so
all right where do we start with this
thing not by opening it that's for sure
so it did include toy jets you know yeah
but it didn't include instructions so
we're gonna have to take their word for
it that it contains a 69 50 X and an
asus strix GT X 1080 that actually that
story doesn't really check out at all
because this is an MSI motherboard and
you know what whatever I'm sure if you
order one you can get it with whatever
you want inside let's focus on what we
can see from the outside the entire case
is plumbed up for the integrated liquid
cooling system with coolant lines
visible on the sides here and over here
and it's got four single 120 millimeter
radiators here here here and here the
whole thing is made out of machined
aluminum and plexi and weighs so much
that it requires two people to move it
io is fairly standard and positioned at
the back but don't be fooled into
thinking that you can just put it on
your desk and fire it up the power cord
can only be inserted into the bottom
once it's mounted on the included
display stand but once you get it in
there you can power this thing up by
sliding your finger down a capacitive
strip at the front whoa is that a thing
of beauty or what so it lights up these
LED lights down both runways and also
add some blue accent lighting to the
bottom now I wouldn't blame you guys for
having decided by this point in the
video that you need one of these two
which all I can say is
frickin bad cuz unless you've got a cool
$20,000 burning a hole in your pocket
you're just going to have to live
without it
