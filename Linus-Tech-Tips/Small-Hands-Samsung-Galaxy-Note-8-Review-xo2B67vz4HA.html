incredible step forward for Android
phone design as a whole that I like many
people couldn't help but get wrapped up
in a whirlwind romance but like the bad
girl who likes your world on fire then
lights your house on fire our
relationship was over as fast as it
began so is the note 8 a note 7 with the
arsonist tendencies removed and is that
even enough a year later
let's find out
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops featured Intel 7th
generation Core i7 processors check them
out at the link below the most
immediately obvious feature of the no
date is the same nearly bezel-less
design and eighteen and a half by nine
aspect ratio OLED screen is the galaxy s
8 but bigger indeed at six point three
inches this is the biggest screen
they've ever crammed into a note device
and I want to get this out of the way
very early in the video whether you
prefer the default more vivid color
profile or the more true to the original
content developer mode sRGB tweaked one
content consumption on this device is an
unbelievable experience if you love
scrolling vertically then whether it's
photos or text you'll be seeing more of
it and bigger than ever before and I'm
not sure if they planned it this way but
the perfect black levels of the OLED
screen makes 21 by 9 content up here as
though it has a perfectly even frame
around it that's super small it's it's
less like watching a movie on your phone
and more like holding a movie in your
hand unfortunately you'll also be
holding the audio in your hand even
Apple has finally implemented earpiece
assisted stereo sound so what's the
excuse Samsung is this just a courageous
move to assume that most users who give
a crap about sound are using Bluetooth
or headphones at this point that's
possible but it still really detracts
from what could be what I would describe
as the near perfect mobile movie
watching experience let's talk about
handling I praised the note sevens hold
ability with my fun-sized hands and some
of the same economic tweaks returned
here notably haha the two-sided curved
glass
very similar 75 millimeter width with
nice flat sides that give you a little
bit more edge to hold on to but the
taller screen comes at a cost here the
note eight weighs so much more than its
predecessor that even though I haven't
held one of those in months it was
obvious to me the first time I touched
it and it hurts accessibility of both
top of the screen UI elements like the
compose button and Samsung's SMS app and
the rear-facing fingerprint sensor from
a natural holding position which is
another disappointment every note device
has had something noteworthy about it
that has set it apart from the s-line a
balls-to-the-wall CPU epic expandability
something with the note 7 it was the
iris scanner which is back and it's
pretty handy when I'm not outside and it
works but what I was really hoping for
was the rumored under screen fingerprint
sensor to bring that back to the front
of the device and instead of that I got
I don't know what what did I get well
compared to the s8 plus it's the same
ten nanometer CPU same GPU we got six
gigs of ram versus four on the microSD
expandable 64 gig storage version and I
guess we got a dual camera system so it
better be a pretty amazing camera then
right well I'm not going to complain
because the s8 and iPhone 7 are already
as good as I feel is reasonable to ask
of a cell phone at this point anything
else is icing and to be clear it's
better Samsung's colorscience still
isn't as true to life as Apple's but in
a way that will probably appeal to lots
of mainstream folks and I definitely
appreciate the easy configuration and
advanced control options available in
their app finally as a daily Samsung
user they're lightning fast double tap
camera launch continues to allow me to
capture precious moments with my kids
and pets that I would otherwise miss
it's just that I'm not an artistic photo
taker meaning that they're
post-processing blur effect on top of
looking unnatural next to true bokeh
doesn't do much for me I super
appreciate the 2 X optical zoom and the
optical image stabilization on both of
the 12 megapixel rear cameras but
overall a dual camera system wasn't
enough to sell me on the iPhone 7 plus
so it's not enough here and in Samsung's
case the photos from the zoom camera are
significantly softer than the wide so a
fair bit of the difference can often be
made up with digital zoom anyway okay
then what about the stylet excuse me
s-pen well what to say about that it's
cool you can highlight text for
translation sketch or jot down difficult
to input things like math formulas more
accurately and with less latency than
ever before and they've added a whack of
cool features for it including notably
the ability to jot down up to a hundred
pages of memos without ever turning your
screen on thanks to the always-on OLED
display I just personally find that not
all but much of what it does can be
easily accomplished with my fingers in
the time that it takes to remove the S
Pen from its holster adjust my grip and
start using it it's certainly not
something that I would personally give
up 200 milli amp hours of battery life
for it if given the choice which is a
drag because getting back to our s8 plus
vs. note comparison that is one
difference along with price that favors
the s8 plus battery life on the phone
that can do it all is just not that
impressive
something Samsung seems to be aware of
given that it ships with a battery
saving resolution downscaling tweak
enabled by default raising the question
of why they bother putting a 29 60 by
1440 screen on it in the first place and
speaking of things I wish they hadn't
included a non reprogrammable dedicated
button for their digital assistant
speak let's say for a minute that I love
Bixby let's say I was blown away by the
way that you can basically execute
macros on your phone I would still
understand the point of view of people
who think that a computer vision based
shopping feature that can't recognize a
bloody iPhone doesn't need a dedicated
button and I would still lobby Samsung
to look past their own arrogance to the
demands of their customers a significant
percentage of which have gone out of
their way to download some janky
third-party app in order to be able to
remap the thing
so then nutshell time I still mostly
like the tweaks in the latest iteration
of TouchWiz screenshot and clipboard
management is epic and Samsung's
keyboard prediction is actually better
than ever but especially at this price I
can't help but notice that Samsung
played it really safe this time no
squeeze input no dolby atmos no built-in
sundial no quantum leap forward in
industrial design the note 8 is not bad
it's arguably the most versatile phone
on the market it does everything it just
feels like for some reason when Samsung
removed the fire from the note 7 the
spark of our love went out to one thing
I probably should have mentioned in the
main video is how freaking slippery the
back of the note 8 is without a sexy D
brand skin it's just something that
didn't really occur to me until I was
shooting this D brand integration after
the fact with D brand you cannot only
protect your device from incidental
scuffs and scratches but you can make it
look better and hold better too I
personally recommend their dragon skin
but they've also got a wide variety of
different vibrant colors and textures
that are all authentic 3m vinyl the best
part of D brand site is that it takes
out the guesswork you just go through
their configurator pick out the skins
that you like they ship it to you
affordably worldwide not to mention
extremely quickly and the whole
installation process just takes a few
minutes
so go check them out at the link in the
video description and skin up your
device today or like in a couple days
when it arrives so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucks you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
