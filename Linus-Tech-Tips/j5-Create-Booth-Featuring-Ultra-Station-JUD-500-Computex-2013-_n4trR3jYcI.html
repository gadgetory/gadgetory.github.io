XCOM hey guys we're here at a booth
called j5 create and there's something
that really caught my eye they have
these things called Newports wormhole
and ultra station technologies when I'm
mainly interested in is the J UD 500 now
I haven't been briefed on this but it's
pretty easy to figure out
so there's DC in and a host USB at the
bottom so you plug the host USB 3 into
your computer plug DC n into the wall
and then that gives all this
functionality up here to your computer
so as you can see along here there's USB
3.0 charging point port here standard
USB 3.0 port HDMI VGA audio mic Ethernet
USB 2.0 and wormhole switch and I'm not
entirely sure what wormhole switch does
maybe if I can catch someone and get
that explained to me we will figure it
out later
sorry guys we're having a few problems
with our camera here if you are someone
who has a business laptop or gaming
laptop or really just a laptop and no
desktop and you want to bring it home
from wherever you are and you want to
increase your functionality you can have
this thing set up you can have already
everything plugged in that you need you
can have an additional monitor plugged
in through this you can have your
keyboard and mouse and everything
plugged in drop your laptop down plug it
all in have dedicated Ethernet
everything so it makes it very easy just
one cable plug in from a USB 3 and you
basically turn it into a desktop of
course it's not going to be as fast in
multiple ways because it's not a desktop
for one and two because you only have
one USB 3.0 Lane going to your computer
and you have all this stuff coming into
it but it's still very very very helpful
if you're not a super power user this is
a very cool idea to get all that more
functionality out of your laptop so
thanks for watching hopefully this is
something you're interested in and you
want to see all of our kinetics content
