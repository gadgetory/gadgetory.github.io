Russian laboratory this is and I don't
know if you guys know this but my
original courser dream machine in the
800 D which is the same case we have
here today is one of my most viewed
videos ever
and that was featuring an X 58 platform
so that's all old crappy now right so
now we have an updated Corsair dream
machine elite this is what Intel's
latest x79 platform so we're using these
soos g9o 79 pro motherboard we also have
an Intel Core i7 3930k unlocked
processor this will be pre overclocked
although the final clock speeds are to
be determined we want to make sure that
whatever clock speed we validate at we
validate it in a case with the side
panel closed to ensure that our
customers are not going to have any
issues with their pre overclocked
machine it also has some other stuff
that's fairly new as well you know what
let's finish up with the outside before
we get inside so you can see it's got a
bit of a blue and black overall color
schemes other than those two video cards
that's 2 Radeon HD 7950 so the reason we
went with 279 50s we went with a 3930k
we went with 16 gigs of ram we want the
pro level motherboard so this is all the
highest possible performance sort of
scaled back one knotch
within reason so you're not paying that
huge premium for getting the halo parts
like the Extreme Edition like the
Republic of gamers board the 79 70's but
you're getting that sort of 85% of the
performance at you know 65 percent of
the price sort of rule that tends to
apply to stuff like that so we've gone
with an 8 X 10 50 yes the ax is a
higher-end power supply but this is also
fully capable of powering machine like
this so it looks great performs great
but it's going to come in at a price
that I don't actually know what the
price is gonna be yet but it'll be
hopefully less than you think so why
don't we just finish up on the outside
here so on the outside you guys have
seen the 800 D before we've got a
blu-ray player
we've got USB 3 so the 800 D has been
updated to include USB 3 now although in
the Lighting's very
we'll hear how good that is in here we
find some cool stuff so there's a three
terabyte storage drive hard drives are
finally starting to come back down and
pricing a little bit as well as the
latest Intel 520 series SandForce SSD
now this is going to be kind of cool
guys we're using a different kind of
lighting it's fully customizable
lighting with this system and when I
take this off it's actually going to
unplug one of them so I got to be a
little bit careful here but we are using
these cool there we are these cool LED
strips from BitFenix see here so there's
LEDs spaced out here you can actually
use little adapters to extend them if
you want to run longer chains of them
see just with these four little plugs
here that's all you got to do you can
actually cut them at the pre marked
places so they're marked on the back so
you can do little short ones here if you
want to get some extra lighting there
these are really really cool these are
pretty similar to the Lee and Lee ones
that I looked at a little while ago or
although they're somewhat cheaper and
there's a wider variety plus they have
that extension ability which the Lee and
Lee ones did not have so you've got the
cable for not running through here other
than that this is a fairly standard
course our case except for the upgraded
fence so we're using Spectre Pro LED
fans for the 35.3 right yeah yeah for
the three 120mm fans in the top we've
got an H 100 cooling the CPU we have a
140 millimeter specter Pro fan here and
then finally we have another 120
millimeter here and I don't know if they
upgraded this one I suspect I didn't
know that's the stock fan that looks
pretty quiet anyway cuz it has the
shroud on it and you can't see it so it
doesn't really contribute anything to
the looks I already mentioned the HX
1050 so you can see the wiring is nice
and clean there's almost nothing you can
coming out at the power supply and then
we're using the included cable routing
options in the 800 D in order to make
things look as clean as possible inside
now this is something that probably a
couple people are gonna comment on the
79 50s are very close together the
reason for that is that a sous doesn't
include long crossfire bridges with
these motherboards so it's something
where if you wanted to source an
aftermarket crossfire bridge you could
move it down to the bottom PCI Express
16 X slot I
it's not the end of the world because
during gaming yes the fens will ramp up
no they do not overheat and then when
you're idling but these cards produce
almost no heat at all anyway so it's
definitely not an issue during just
day-to-day usage so yeah it's not
perfect but it's a solution that we can
live with you're in the PC a laboratory
I think that pretty much covers it you
know I mean we might as well show the
overall IO options available on this
motherboard so we do have Intel Ethernet
which is cool for USB 3.0 ports eSATA we
have their BIOS flashback feature bios
flashback is cool because even though it
comes pre overclocked if you decide to
keep tweaking it you will and and you
run into issues where you corrupt your
BIOS so you update the BIOS and you
corrupt it that way you can actually
flash it back just by putting a BIOS
file on a USB disk putting it into the
corresponding port all this infos in
your motherboard manual that you'll
receive with your system and then you
can reflash the BIOS just like that so
that's actually really cool as well now
there was something that I was sure I
wanted to mention oh yeah okay well
there's obviously the fact that while
this is sort of not quite balls to the
walls
you know 16 gigs instead of 32 gigs
around 79 50s instead of 79 70s new
extreme edition it can be upgraded to
add all of those parts and the
aesthetics will still be awesome last
thing I want you guys to see is actually
be turned on you can see the brightness
of these LEDs up there so I think that's
cool can you see that yeah it's like
almost like too bright like if I like
cover here a little bit maybe I don't
know I don't know how to like show how
bright they are without like blinding
the camera so thank you for checking out
this PC laboratory update the Corsair
dream machine elites updated 2012
edition will be coming out soon don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews
behind-the-scenes updates here in the
lab and other great stuff like that also
this SSD is awesome I know I haven't
done a video about it yet but it's like
