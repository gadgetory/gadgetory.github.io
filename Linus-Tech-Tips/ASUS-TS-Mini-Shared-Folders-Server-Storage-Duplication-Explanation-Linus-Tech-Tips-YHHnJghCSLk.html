separate video how to set up the user
accounts on windows home server as well
as I have covered how to configure
computer backups computer backups are
probably one of the biggest killer
features of elm server let's talk about
the next killer feature of home server
the shared folders and what all of that
means so there are several ways to
access the shared folders you can either
access them through the regular network
PC navigation so you just go onto TS
mini and then you can browse all the
folders available on the home server
there the setup wizard also creates a
shortcut on your desktop to your shared
folders on the windows home server and
then the last most common way is to
access it through the icon in the bottom
right so you just click shared folders
so once that's open you can go ahead and
browse all the full all the folders that
are automatically created by home server
and find your way into the user folder
so I'm in the Linus folder where right
now there is nothing but I'm going to go
ahead and show off the speed of windows
home server now bearing in mind that
home server is running on a feeble atom
processor so this isn't exactly a speed
demon computer here home server does not
need a whole lot of resources to run
wicked fast for file serving so you can
sustain about 80 70 to 80 megabytes per
second with large files so i just copied
how much is this 467 Meg's to my home
server in just a couple seconds there
which is a pretty nice feature so let's
do another 360 bags and yeah so that
took about four or five seconds which is
terrific but that's not all but wait
there's more right here you can see I
have duplication enabled for the Linus
folder so what duplication means I'm
going to go ahead and go into properties
here so here we go here is the name of
the Linus folder the description for the
lioness folder and enable folder
duplication I have two hard drives right
now in my windows home server if I go
into the server storage I can see right
here I have two identical 500 gig drives
and what duplication
is you can see right here the shared
folders are 137 Meg's and duplications
137 Meg's what it does is it takes
everything in a duplication enabled
folder and make sure that it is always
on at least two physical drives within
the home server that means that if one
of my drives dies or is removed or is
struck by lightning or whatever happens
my data will be safe now that doesn't
mean that home server is completely
immune to things like virus infected
files it's not going to fix problems
that you caused but if you are in danger
of a physical failure causing you to
lose your data windows home server will
protect you in ninety nine percent of
cases now the duplication is not a
hardware RAID solution it is more like a
software raid solution so that means it
is not real time but it's fairly close
to real time that actually had several
drives died in my home server which I
have about six hard drives in right now
and I have never lost an important piece
of data that means I've never lost any
data in one of my duplicated folders now
I did set certain things like the public
folder to not be duplicated and I have
lost files from there but I don't care
about those files so that is the other
huge huge feature of windows home server
you can also add other folders like you
could say oh no I'm in users whoops you
can add folders like let's say this is
the expendable folder okay I'm not going
to enable folder duplication because I
don't care about this data I can
configure it so that any guest has full
access and Linus has full access to this
folder so this is just going to be some
random folder that means that the data
in the expendable folder will not take
up double the space because every magg i
right to Linus is going to be actually
written to megs to two separate drives
expendable will only write one meg 21
drive so it means it takes up less space
but it's also less safe thank you for
