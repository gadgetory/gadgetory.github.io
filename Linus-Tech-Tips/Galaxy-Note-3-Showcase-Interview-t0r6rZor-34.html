fully private click now to learn more so
we're here with ken price from Samsung
Canada who's going to be showing us the
Galaxy Note 3 which is their latest and
greatest tell us what you guys have done
to improve this over the well legendary
at this point galaxy note 2 sure I think
what people will find it slightly
narrower slightly longer has a larger
screen size we've been more efficient in
terms of the use of the bezel all the
hardware's updated processor 3 gigabytes
of onra onboard memory 32 gigabytes of
storage that's standard and it's also
though in many ways familiar for samsung
folks a you know a product that we've
put a lot of thought into the into the
design otherwise you're still able to
get inside of the device even though it
has this nice sort of luxurious feeling
kind of leather background with leather
feeling background but in fact it's
still the same flexible light casing
that we've always had NFC supported
through the battery 3200 milliamp
battery able to add external storage 13
megapixel camera and for those that have
been following along this is a device
that borrows a lot from the galaxy s4 in
terms of its functionality but it's also
able to take high-end video more so than
any other device from Samsung now you've
covered spec a little bit here so it
does 4k video and also 1080p video up to
60fps which is pretty awesome but tell
us what else what do you mean by latest
and greatest hardware inside sure so I
think that well I think actually the
other functionality that I wanted to
cover is more related to the stylus
itself where we're kind of bringing
forward the use of the pen because what
is signature about the note more than
any of the device in the family is the
fact that we have this option for folks
who want to use a pen as part of the
natural functionality if it'll just come
out of here just like I rehearsed it
right so the first thing you'll notice
is that there's an Air Command feature
so this is using that hovering
technology that we first saw on the gal
on the note too actually and then also
extended on the galaxy s4
see that in fact I'm able to call up
certain commands just by hovering the
screen and then i use the the button
that's on the pen itself to fire up some
of those commands things as simple as
being able to take an action memo so I'm
able to take a quick note or I can
create a new window inside of the inside
of the device and also it's able to sort
of navigate now without having to put
the pen down and that's the biggest
advantage of the no.3 show us that
window that window feature sure so for
example if I if I invoke this pen window
functionality you see that I just click
that quickly then I draw a square and
then I'm able to run certain utilities
or programs inside of that window so
what's I wanted to do so this is sort of
replicating you know I'm taking notes or
I'm doing something else on the phone
geez I need to make a quick calculation
how can I sort of call that up or I want
to see a quick video or do some other
functionality and being able to take
advantage of this sort of advanced
hardware with it without having to
disturb what I was doing otherwise so
obviously one of the big stories with
the note 3 given that it's launching at
the same time is integration with the
galaxy gear smartwatch so tell me how
these two are a match made in heaven in
your eyes sure well I think that there
are as powerful as smartphones are and
there are still some transactions that
you might have that are more immediately
served by something that's more intimate
to you so for example being able to take
a quick picture or get a notification
that I'm responding to rather than
seeing that on the device I can have
that in a place that's actually closer
to me there's a piece of software that
actually is tightly coupled to the use
of the of the device itself which is
called the gear manager which is how you
would actually use the two devices
together so what would you expect to do
using the gear versus actually pulling
your massive phone out of your pocket
sure well you know a couple of examples
might be taking a quick picture because
it still takes some time to you know be
able to take the camera out and set it
up and so on and if you wanted a
high-end picture that's great if you
wanted a quick snapshot to take a video
memo almost that it might be better
served with something that's more
closely a hand or get notifications that
are are sent to me while the devices
let's say
or in my pocket or something like that
without actually having to respond or
even take a call which I could do
without actually having to ironically
take out the smart phone and use it I
could actually just take that call right
from the actually the galaxy gear so
convergence is dead then and it's where
we're now we're now taking the phone
functionality out of the phone and
putting all the other functionality into
the phone well I think we've recognized
that mobile communications is now the
hub of what this is doing and that's a
much more powerful idea than just
emailing and phoning there's a number of
things that people are going to do in
terms of running applications so then
the question is is that you know how can
we improve the convenience of how a
mobile communication device works and we
think that having something close at
hand and on your wrist is going to be
part of that answer awesome thanks very
much Ken and without further ado I'd
like for the viewers to direct their
attention to some nice glamour footage
of the galaxy note 3 which if you're
into big phones is very likely to be
your next badly
