our attempted reassembly of our 8k red
camera so I took it apart what's that
face for I don't want to be responsible
for this so I took it apart a long time
ago and I the intention was to water
cool this camera the problem that I ran
into though is that I never did any
before readings so we would go in water
cool the camera but then we wouldn't
have any baseline to compare it against
and so the realization was that I needed
to put it back together so I enlisted
Alex's help and we are gonna put this
camera back together summer break just
started but it's never too early to
start looking for a new laptop for back
to school every words in PC laptop is
ready for whatever games or school
projects you're gonna tackle and you can
check out their special deals at the
link below
so let's start by having a look at
what's in the bin here so every one of
these is oriented exactly the way that
it needs to be in here so that the
screws that are taped into place don't
fall out because they're all kind of
semi looking with just subtle
differences between them and if they
weren't sitting in the slots where they
go it would be really hard to not
accidentally put a screw that's too long
into a place that's too short and dead
camera yeah that's a really easy thing
to do
in my experience taking apart and
reassembling laptops so I can't even
imagine for this yeah so let's go ahead
and start taking pieces out carefully
carefully there bud so because it's been
six months since I took this apart I
have no idea how to put it back together
but fortunately we actually if we first
heard from these guys like what two
years ago we first years or something
like that so a company called less pain
software normally when you ingest red
footage it's its raw footage so you end
up with these are 3d files that are
split up into four gig chunks so this is
one long video clip that you're looking
at here but it's in these like three
chunks and as you can see there's no
thumbnails or anything like that so the
only way to really find out what's in
them is to open them in red player which
is pretty tedious or you can use this
program called red cine X Pro which is
free well that is to say free for anyone
who buys a red camera and then you can
navigate to your folder and
is that what's in here whatever it sucks
and it's not it's not great for like
browsing media so that is where Chi know
comes in so with chi know this card we
should be able to take our read
disassembly here we just drill down and
there we have it that's all the clips
and we can browse them and move them
around if we should see fit and wow
that's a lot of video footage so video
is good pictures are good both is best
okay so I guess we start at the end yeah
so I even recorded some short video
clips for ourselves okay so there you go
Andy
passed Linus has our back that's the
screw we're looking for you got it now I
just have to find it how about this one
I think these guys okay what was the
same screw yeah yeah we both came to the
same food you just almost drop it yeah
the rest of the video goes this well so
you're putting that heatsink back on
how's that going for you
I'm just loosely putting the screws in
it seems like that this one right here
is not correct okay you know that's a
through-hole there you go that's why
okay and what board is that this is the
board with three chummy's coming off of
it three chubbies okay those seem to
have worked okay so we're good yeah you
know that er we screwed in the wrong
ones we'll find it later okay see that
okay it's kind of wedged in there so is
that what we did it also seems like that
we need some sort of a standoff right
there
I don't think so
it's got it so this comes like up a
little bit and I think it goes on in
there
seems like stuck on there when it came
out there like that uh yeah it's not
look great yeah some short enough
um yeah I'm calling that good okay soul
is this tighten it down or no no but
just be careful so then I wonder which
screw goes in the left there okay said
that one goes down all the way oh yeah
that one goes down all the way okay cool
it's either this one or this one
oh and ones long and one short yeah okay
that's fine
addendum that's the so the short one
goes here yeah okay so we're so so we've
we've put one thing back in yep so
here's the nightmare thing it looks like
all this is on there correctly so this
heatsink basically screws directly into
like the chip and that's on there so I
wonder if there's something that was
supposed to go like between these two
things nope no no this is the picture of
having removed it it's not good yeah so
the orientation is wrong so here I'm
gonna put it back leg of that there's
this weird gasket that is presumably
going to come into play at some point
and this other one but yeah all this
looks like stuff that we actually have
not altered so that's the cooler for the
actual sensor so that's gonna be the
most important thing for us to water
cool yeah as we're making our way
through the rest of this project given
that's like pretty penner I think that
we can beat it pretty easily yeah it's a
matter of like getting it in there
though that's the problem okay so we
need this board which is presumably the
other side of this board those are gonna
fall out all of them oh yeah good call
yeah so have this follow me yeah okay
I've got these all right so that's
confusing that do you see anything that
looks like that is that it oh wow thank
you passed Linus sometimes you're not
this goes through here and then through
that but this isn't threaded so nothing
else is gonna have to go on the other
side of this wholly crapballs that's
terrible news
I think the screw that we put in here
might not be long enough just look it
barely comes through but wait no though
it's fine
no no it's fine because see this one is
raised yes yes okay so that is exactly
fine and presumably that one right there
it goes through that so we've put the
cooler back on whatever that was and a
bunch of RAM chips ah should we tighten
it down sure ah two down lots to go so
that does look like this but like what
the crowd oh yeah it does how would that
work
okay hold on don't panic I'm not
panicking I'm not even oh well I think I
think I this goes in like here okay guys
at home ladies gentlemen however hard
this is for you to watch know that it's
that much harder for us to be a part of
theirs it's a two-piece here no geez
what does that give it us enough room
yes oh cool so then we'll just have to
slip this back in alright that is a very
big piece of metal it's not seem right
what doesn't seem right there no it's
straight ish do I use my spudger nope my
spiders not good enough really just crap
my spider is identical to your sponge no
my spudger has we have history don't
think of my spider is like think of it
as seasoned okay hey good work like
high-five not while you're holding that
yeah this photo is really not great
so we know that okay all the screws are
do seem to still be in which is good
yeah
I'm starting to have flashbacks now I
think this is where she has got real so
this goes here does it looks like it's
way closer in that picture or like no
there's a bottom piece there's a bottom
piece that I think looks like here this
one this is the bottom of the camera
this isn't that a 90 degree turn right
here yeah yeah no no it's like this here
it was like that yes like vanish and
this goes right here yeah okay it's not
that look Dwayne oh yeah this is by far
the most expensive puzzle that I have
ever taken apart and put back together
so it was loose actually it was loose
when we were still taking off this piece
so it's not unreasonable for this whole
middle thing to just not quite attached
yet yeah okay sorry I'm gonna watch a
little faster here so here I'm taking
off that matte plastic plate that is on
your right there so here's where I take
off the gasket alright here's where I
point out the gasket move screws that
hopefully are still on there so right
yeah that's where that sticks up okay so
here we go
so that just falls away what are those
little rubber chums
we don't know oh it's this it says okay
it's not right there yeah yeah okay so
see this
it's just loose okay
yeah so here I'm just checking the
orientation of this so this guy is in
here like this yep so that's just like
there but also just doesn't matter right
now and then we can put our plastic
thing on that's the one okay so we
should take all the tape off first hey
yeah here actually here can I hand you
this piece of tape and can you remember
the orientation oh wait that's crew just
stayed in okay what I can't quite tell
oh wow that was really painless okay
this needs to go under here yeah okay so
we're looking for three ribbons the LSB
that looks promising right there
that looks very promising yeah that
looks like it okay alright continue
nervous laughter that's what the
captions should say I'm so unfortunate
to drop screw in through here please
don't I'm gonna try not to it really
doesn't help that these are all
non-ferrous screws so they don't stick
to our screwdrivers did you tighten all
those up yep look or I didn't tighten
all of them yeah let's let's I think
we're good to tighten those up and then
I believe the next piece is that but on
the other side and this one also has all
the screws in place we actually did a
pretty good job of keeping all this
stuff together like this is going better
than I probably expected yeah same okay
time for the other side I think let me
consult the footage so this right here
is that where is red one right here is
here now where does that go
is this the board for this side it
doesn't like it would go in there yeah
but it also looks like that that would
go happily that goes there that goes
there that's definite okay yeah oh yeah
let's consult the footage shall we we're
halfway there
according to the footage anyway looks
like that this goes great here yeah I
want to do it in the same order though
Justin get someone we have to put
sexually it looks like yes we're doing
that that one yeah so here do you want
me to just hold on to those for now
that's probably a good idea yeah I just
took the screws onto my hand yeah there
we go okay yeah I'll just they're all
the same so it doesn't matter Wow that's
all in what is this good question
this is probably this yeah that seems
likely okay wonder where the other side
goes presumably the board that good no
that goes on the other side I'm guessing
I'm guessing okay oh this chip right
here is probably what goes on that Rando
heat pad yeah okay let me just check the
order here I just don't want to do this
out of work ya have to what board am I
looking at here this one okay okay so it
looks like the next thing I'm pulling
off here is actually the fans I don't
know if that makes sense
had I already remove the PCB from the
other side have a look here put these go
like right here oh okay no I did the
other PCB like way earlier so yeah it
looks like we're yeah is this the next
thing that I do
okay fan one fan - I'm guessing it
doesn't matter which one plugs into
which oh I see what's going on okay so
this little wireless guy yeah that
connects to right here you know what we
should plug them in first I guess do you
want to plug them in and then we'll
manage them after which one do you think
is the oh that looks like he goes there
okay okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna hold all the tension off the cord
and then you put it in yeah okay so
you'll have to line it up and make sure
it's actually on there I think it is
though yeah there we go
so these must be external screws that
must be I would say it's those big fat
ones yeah I'm guessing these yeah sure
just go for it all right
it's got to be nothing else has
threading that even it's closer and it's
also the one that has the most crap on
it
it isn't a stopper on these holes it is
amazing how tightly this is sandwiched
like I am holding this together this is
one compacting machine
okay oh it's kind of starting to look
like a camera again it's none of a
bucket of parts Oh No
so I oh so I disassembled it in a really
weird order okay so I think even though
that's not the order that I did it in
last time we should put this PCB on now
all right okay so where did the screws
for that go
oh these must be them at their foreign
finding channel 5 fine please laughs yep
perfect
now there will be no extras updated 0 X
0 extra screws we are professionals we
helpfully past Linus helpfully put all
the screws where they go for us it's
starting to really look very Camry you
know yeah wow that's a lot of screws on
this one yeah but then again this is
where all the weight of the camera and
the entire rig is going to be resting
okay so it one screw left okay wait oh
yeah Oh what is this that looks like a
super-special screw yep store lock screw
Oh warranties find out lordy
door locks crew what does the lockscreen
look like so Jake just explained what
the back focused locks crew does you use
it to lock the sensor in place if you're
transporting the camera or something
like that so you don't technically need
it in there I mean it's probably ideal
but it also is not necessarily like
marked like that because it's dangerous
to have it out or something like that
it's marked like that so it's easy to
find because it is intended to be user
adjustable okay alright so you just want
you to keep learning put this plate on
yep okay you really want to put that
plate on okay now we put this chill on
seems fun let's make sure you have it
lined up because there's that don't
connector down okay that seems pretty
we're really close yep so this I don't
know where does this look like it goes
kind of looks like it goes here that
doesn't make any sense other way around
maybe yeah yeah yeah good call I'm
guessing that this is it this one yeah
one might has three holes or three
screws all right where that goes then
probably along this side that's my guess
I just don't see where oh and less this
covering up a weight is that an extra
screw Fadden hmm I think we found it oh
wait no because we're too short
oh okay so let's hold on to that for now
um and then this guy he's gonna go wait
what the crap what if this is
orientation agnostic I feel like it is
we have two extras oh dang okay so we
went and we put all the screws in but we
didn't realize that there was just a
little thing that goes on here that was
already preloaded with all the screws
that it needed under it okay back focus
lock screw found confirmed there it is
Bob okay
fun fact Alex um all of these black
skinny screws are not the same oh that's
fun
yep some of them are threaded more
differently than the other ones come on
out baby yeah I get out thank you
so I need one of the thicker ones for
this that's probably why I had two of
them in tape separately
alright that's maybe they are all the
same then I don't know I can't tell it's
time to say this one looks kind of
longer isn't it wait clothes are hex as
well I should really start if you really
start using a hex driver for this so
wait this one right here is definitely
Torx though which one this one oh well
that's interesting because that's
definitely hex there's a torque susan's
of torques torques hex
so I have two hexes I think they're all
torque says no this one's hax well that
one's hex but what what these other ones
down here one stork stork storks you
said torques three times but I only see
two screws yeah no I just said that an
extra time okay I mean at this point do
we just give up and just throw it yeah
they're all the same length like ours
okay so I guess we're either done or
disappointing yeah
last screw ladies and gentlemen and this
is the one that I think the things we
just stripped okay whatever yeah okay
not gonna not gonna care about that cuz
it's all here good enough okay
hit me so this guy just screws onto here
and then do we have a display right oh
so you just want to see an LED wow you
have very little confidence in this
project hey David okay um are we ready
yes that button on the right side okay
here we go ladies and gentlemen we've
got the fans on till we intake where's
the LED squish to be okay we've got
power
oh oh yeah I want to see an image Jake
show me that beautiful face it's gonna
be the first thing this camera ever sees
okay so we have no reason to believe at
this moment then that it doesn't work
that was stressful all right
now we need to water cooler yeah just
completely disassembled it yeah yeah but
we need to do some pre-testing first so
Brandon what I was kind of thinking is I
would like you to do some pre
benchmarking on it and I want to know
how loud it is both at idle and under
more strenuous conditions we want to
know how hot it gets and then we also
want to have some test footage
ideally in highlight so some with with
adequate lighting and some in our
low-light scenario that we can then
compare against our image when we are
done

linked in the video description do we
have like a red camera down there I
don't think we have enough red affiliate
link yeah we got P ia we got the ltte
store so yeah check out some check out
some merch we got the brand new hard
drive shirt down there uh looks pretty
sick if I do say so myself
not that I designed it myself for
anything and then of course stealth
hoodie we're probably going to sell out
of the first shipment of them fairly
soon we did get more ordered but if you
want to make sure that you get one right
away then head to LT t store comm I
