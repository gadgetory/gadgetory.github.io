Taiwanese internet cafes brings up stuff
like stabbings deaths and other
horrendous conditions we decided to come
to Taiwan and check it out ourselves to
see if those things are absolutely kind
of true or if the internet cafes are
nicer and cleaner and more entertaining
let's check it out cooler masters master
case maker five features the freeform
modular system allowing you to customize
adjust and upgrade on your own make it
yours at the link in the video
description down below
welcome to Li Guang cyber cafe housing
200 computers equipped with 160 NVIDIA
GTX 960 s 40 GTX 970 s 200 intel core i7
2670 fa in all of Taipei and it is the
only one in all of Taiwan that has
NVIDIA certification which is only one
of three in the entire world let's go
check it out membership is cheap as hell
about 30 cents in US Dollars and then
for actual game time if you spend 15
bucks you get about 22 hours after that
naturally the more you spend the more
bonus hours you get competitive online
games foster an electrifying atmosphere
of frustration intensity and
surprisingly often victory
the fourth floor is covered head to toe
in NVIDIA branding and there's 255
competitive rooms which can be used for
many different tournaments and booked
for different teams to house 'scrimish
azure practices or whatever they would
like li hua hua has been open 24 hours a
day for 15 years but is it too old to
innovate they're constantly trying new
things to see what works for their
customers like mechanical keyboards and
3440 by 1440p ultra wide monitors and
you need never fear for going hungry
they've positioned themselves as a
restaurant as well and you can call for
food at basically any time by just
clicking something simple on your
desktop after you die in League of
Legends because you're a noob and the
food is actually surprisingly good and
they have a lot of it their menu is huge
so you'll probably be able to be
satisfied with at least something on it
and you never have to leave the comfort
of your leather chair I love it here the
food the environment the games it's it's
all great it makes me want to grab for
friends former competitive team and try
really hard probably get rekt because
the caliber of players here is very high
but it would be fun anyways this place
is great but it's really high-energy
what if you just want to be laid-back
enter queue time at about $3 for a
membership and about a dollar an hour
after that hanging out at queue time is
pretty freakin cheap but that also
includes stuff like tea various other
beverages and unlimited ice cream if
that's more your game if you're not
really into the tea stuff moving on that
price also includes a room so we're to
hang out with if you have two
like-minded friends so at least three of
you you can get this room my favourite
one jumping inside there's an upstairs
bunk we have to climb a ladder which is
just fantastically fun a downstairs bunk
where you can hang out a big nice TV
little bit subpar computer it's got a
760 Intel processor GTS 460 and four
gigs of ram not time to phone home about
but you might be able to play Warcraft 3
or something in here you have a smaller
room you could be in here by yourself or
maybe with your partner or something
you've got a computer a TV and a couch
to hang out on to keep your company
while you're relaxing they have near
endless amounts of manga and novels and
comic books movies and you can even
borrow an Xbox one or Playstation 4
all for free and then if you need some
extra stuff you can pay a little bit
more and use something like their
laundry machine or even their showers I
like it here and while it might not be
my first choice compared to the more
gaming inspired cybercafe I understand
the appeal its relaxing and comfortable
someone's literally asleep right now you
can do that the age range of people that
come here is more like 18 to 85 instead
of the cyber cafe which was like 15 to
35 it's quite different let's talk to
one of them to see what he thinks
what did he been that's a bit a suti
samarco yo gangjae and sue I can tell
y'all some of you someone you've been
cheating dividend sending so quickly
that that I totally got into searching
how which intent of it when you pair the
strengths of these two cyber cafes
together you get something pretty cool
you have two different options to create
a home away from home somewhere to game
somewhere to relax you don't have to be
at home to do those things you don't
have to have the stuff that these places
have in order to do them that's pretty
cool both internet cafes or cyber cafes
or whatever you want to call them we're
uniquely attractive entertainment
options for ridiculously low prices I
see why people go and considering the
amount of people that go to these things
I'm not surprised that there happened to
be some deaths yes it's a horrible thing
but a lot of people die watching TV to
ting is the mobile carrier that is
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction first don't speak to a
robot get pushed directly through to a
person potentially like the guy over
there with the muscle car or motorbike
or whatever that loud thing is and pay
only for what you use the average ting
bill is a
only $24 a month per device if you're
stuck in a contract and switch to tang
they'll even cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks so head
over to Linus 10.com and try out their
savings calculator to figure out how
much you can well save when you sign up
with our link you also get $25 in
service credit or 25 bucks towards a new
device you can save more money to spend
on your gas guzzling vehicle if you guys
