centimeter fan to cool your gaming
notebook and it adds a four port USB hub
click now to learn more often I look at
an external Thunderbolt Drive and I
can't really see any reason why it had
to be thunderbolt a great example of
this would be a single drive external
drive that's bottlenecked by the drive
performance rather than an alternative
less expensive interface like USB 3
another example would be a large multi
drive array device that I'd really
rather see using a network solution like
10 Gigabit Ethernet let's get going on
that standard huh but my passport pro is
an exception here though it has two
internal drives that can be run
independently in raid 0 or in raid 1 and
it legitimately benefits from
thunderbolt running in raid 0 we were
able to achieve consistent read and
write speeds like sustained of about 200
megabytes per second better than we've
ever been able to achieve on any USB 3
solution and because Thunderbolt is
capable of outputting more power than
USB it is also able to power up both
drives without resorting to an auxiliary
connector or wall power adapter
something that will be a major advantage
for anyone working on the go
in fact it not only doesn't require a
separate power Knable
that is to say a connector and a cable
integrated it also doesn't require you
to cart a Thunderbolt cable around with
you the cable is integrated and wraps
around the drive for storage there is
one trick with this drive though our
physical inspection of it reveals that
our 4 char byte model is extremely thick
for an external hard drive it actually
uses a fan for active cooling and as we
get a closer look at that cable by the
way this is how it wraps up and that's
about how long it takes to wrap it up as
we get a closer look at that we see just
that cable there is no alternative
connector such as USB 3 which would have
added additional cost and bulk to the
solution the My Passport pro only works
over Thunderbolt which is something that
will be a deal-breaker for many but
given how focused this product is on Mac
users of course they have Thunderbolt
who are creative professionals I mean
the drive utility program is only even
available on Mac I doubt most people
looking
this drive will even notice and anyway
using diskpart to manually delete the
factory created Mac compatible
partitions then creating our own
structure gives us all the same
functionality on a thunderbolt equipped
PC you'll just need to import the
foreign Drive configuration in disk
manager whenever you plug it into a new
PC piece of cake
now I mentioned creative professionals
before I guess that leads pretty well
into the who is this product for segment
of the video creative folks who are on
the go this thing was practically made
for us when shooting raw video footage
or even ProRes sometimes we can easily
fill up our dual 512 gigas SD reporter
solution and having something that can
offload very quickly using a notebook
without needing to fuss about with power
adapters or whatever else something with
a lot of capacity is a huge boon the
sooner we can get back to shooting the
better because you've got actors and and
helpers just sitting there when you're
offloading footage eSATA would have been
just as good for this and I really wish
it had taken off as a standard but due
to its specialized storage only nature
non-powered standard configuration and
fragile connector it was not meant to be
so Thunderbolt will have to do the trick
alright so far so good on the dual drive
pro but what about the other solutions
out there this is by no means the first
dual external drive in fact we have an
angel bird SSD to go twin that's
fulfilled a similar need for us safe
fast portable storage for almost a year
but there are some differences while
it's less likely be damaged in transit
it's extremely expensive lower capacity
and doesn't support trim so performance
is actually gotten significantly slower
since we first started using it which is
something that can be addressed by
secure erasing it but it's not always
convenient when you got footage on it
from this project and another project or
whatever else there's also the sinner
raid CRH 212 enclosure which is only
about 50 bucks plus the cost of drives
or something that's functionally pretty
similar so it is less expensive but it
only uses USB 3 so performance is lower
it needs to be plugged into two ports
for adequate power and it lacks the
cooling solution used by the WD drive
and they're also in the Amazon reviews
also some complaints about the overall
build quality of it and this one no
complaints whatsoever so the only thing
left now is the conclusion and
for that I'll give you the rundown of
how my team plans to use this raid zero
and a portable drive is just plain
stupid in my opinion yeah I ran some
benchmarks for you before but in my mind
that's only really useful from a
theoretical standpoint the raid 1 speed
reality check kind of sucks when you've
been benchmarking raid zero but for a
drive that's intended to be checked into
a gear bag and carried around and
jostled around with other equipment no
matter how well it's built the
likelihood of failure is so much higher
than a drive that sits in your computer
tower and never gets moved but that is
really how I would recommend actually
using it that way you've got two
terabyte load with the four terabyte
model you've got two terabytes of
overall safe storage that's going to be
there even in the event of a hardware
failure which if you're backing up a
project for samples canopy something
that's pretty darn important so thank
you guys very much for watching this
video like it and share it if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it you can
support us by checking out the support
us link in the video description got all
kinds of great stuff you can buy
t-shirts you can give us a monthly
contribution you can change your Amazon
URL so that it includes our bookmark or
whatever those things are called so it
includes our affiliate code I think
there are other things I say as always
don't forget to subscribe I didn't write
it in my script today and that's how
reliant I've gotten on the teleprompter
it's a sad state of affairs we should
see if I can do a video blindfolded to
see if I can even function without the
teleprompter we'll just go like
electricians tape thank you for watching
this episode Linus tech tips without me
being able to see for the last ten
seconds of it this hurts
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
