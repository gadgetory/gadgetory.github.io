simple goal number one build the gaming
PC for the 1% the fastest off-the-shelf
gaming rig that money can buy
goal number two don't completely f it up
like last time that's fine too
so let's start with what's gonna be the
same as our last attempt that you guys
will never see because it was awful
first a handful of you
we're probably thinking to yourselves
while eivin and i criticized every
system integrator on the planet could
you guys even do it better so we are
actually going to be trying to build a
system better so we're gonna be doing it
together today and we are sticking with
the core i9 9900 k-8 core processor we
are sticking with dual GTX 2080 tird
Strix cards from Asus these are the
overclocked versions and we are sticking
with 32 gigs of our ddr4 3200 memory we
know that's not quite the fastest memory
but okay that's the one thing that's not
fastest give us a break so this is the
dark base pro 900 we have upgraded our
power supply to a 1000 watt dark pro 11
and perhaps most importantly because
this was our biggest problem we have
changed our motherboard instead of
trying to get away with three slots of
spacing between our xx atti graphics
cards by the way pro tip for you guys
those things run freaking hot we have
gone with a motherboard that will allow
us to have quad spacing and this was
actually what necessitated the case
change because this is one massive z3 90
board it's actually larger than standard
ATX but not quite EA TX it's kind of in
that in-between land what the hell is
going on here is this like an OC dial
yet lets you turn off your gaming to 11
it's madness how much is this thing look
at it it has two regular USB threes two
of the new type C ones you dot two three
m dot twos that's not all of them there
is X expansion card for I believe two
more inside I mean I think that's their
flagship and it says godlike right on it
it has a quarter inch headphone jack it
even has an infinity mirror up on this
that's what it is oh my god okay anyway
let's build a ring shall we
Shh so as usual we're gonna start with
our CPU so we've got a core I 999
hundred K is it the best value for
gaming no is it the fastest for gaming
yes there is a small asterisk we did run
into some weird issues with minimum FPS
with hyper-threading enabled seems to be
like a window scheduler thing now round
these are pretty memory slots I actually
haven't used an MSI board for a buildin
quite some time I think we have orange
this is being covered by the heatsink
pretty much entirely even CID however we
do have the orange gift oh really yeah
check check over here I'll check
upstairs okay okay just put in white
some tried and zroll for lulz oh yeah
this is 4,000 pound it it's okay we're
gonna go try to 0l anyway it's so far
over the top
oh man look at this oh I mean come on
there's a certain point where once you
go tackier it gets pretty you know
having so much fun right now I've never
had this much fun installing Ram look at
this CPU cooler next n all right
let's do it I think I lost the English
manual but they got German in the
Russian which one you want to go it
looks like you're you're doing the
heatsink then okay German are this fine
what no but do you don't read German do
you know you don't I don't even pick a
Russian would take the Russian one we
can see the coolly romantic brutal midok
out that cooler so here goes our first m
dot 2 device it's a 960 Pro I know we
actually have a 970 Pro over there but
like this already has an OS on it and it
really doesn't make that much of a
difference our second m dot 2 device is
going to be a 32 gig obtained memory
module to accelerate our 12 terabyte
hard drive that way we can have a great
big library of games
well one can say theorem the to get
shorter than you are
screwed what no no no one is saying that
with your idea to have me in the videos
now I know how all the ROG rigged reboot
kids felt just these jokes and these
references I can't I can't take it
anymore so our power supply here is 80
plus Platinum certified comes with a
mostly modular interface so the one
cable they have pre attached is the 24
pin ATX connector you'll probably need
one of those and it uses one of be quiet
very quiet fans which which one do they
use on this one actually I believe it's
723 this is a silent Lynx 3 oh that's
pretty nice
we are jerman it is exactly 135
millimeters we don't care that everyone
else calls it 140 so we need for this
motherboard to eight pin connectors for
our video cards we need to do late pin
PCI Express connectors and then for our
hard drive need a couple of SATA
connectors for that so I'll grab one of
these in case your stock does
manufacturer's opinion aka the manual
over here oh I've no I was about to
actually acknowledge that and full marks
for like being built like a tank but the
armor is preventing me from inserting
the power supply I am going to figure
this out without the manual yes
alright so power supply goes in here we
got our nice filtered air intake for it
bippity Boppity done check out the thumb
screws this power supply comes with and
they ship 5 just in case when is bad I
guess that Ram is really tight so I'm
running the dual 8 pins that we're gonna
need for the top of our motherboard
right now so I can run them straight up
the back here that's not bad so I'm just
by measuring the distance between the
card hahaha
what wow that is really tight but what's
nice is check this out so I'm gonna
bring the other one over real quick here
unlike our last kick at the can we can
put our second card right there giving
both of them ample room to breathe
I really would not want to be a PCIe 1x
card installed in between these we're
just finishing up a little bit of cable
management here so we've got both of our
fans running off of the CPU fan one
connector here we're just kind of trying
to tuck this man I already tried jamming
it in so if I couldn't fit you obviously
won't either oh that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me I think I can be
happy with that you can still spend all
right some motherboards going in someone
used to hold the case how about you put
it in the hold it so it doesn't tip over
it's just really heavy get it Linus tech
tips ok this is my life ok and judge man
this is looking good though here's the
thing I think we should actually install
the upper cover because see how tight
the clearances the right one I think is
not fully and there's a gap
oh they disconnected all right I said
now is it ok cards good this thing it's
like thicker than my accent all right so
that's in like frickin barely this whole
system is nuts so we're almost done most
of the standard wiring just connecting a
USB 3 header here but there's some
interesting stuff about the case at the
back so we've got we can have
performance or silent configured along
these 4 or these 4 ports we're going to
go straight to performance based on our
experience last time then we've also got
the ability to plug in RGB for our
included LED strips right here you can
connect the fan controller to PWM and
then you can use the included fan
controller so if you move it all the way
over to the left it just lets the
motherboard control it and then if you
move it over then you've got completely
infinite control so no steps completely
stepless control from either what is it
400 to 1100 or something yes and then
the performance mode is like 600 to 1400
suite
alright so let's do it I'm gonna
the RGB connector in a single most
important connector in this entire
building and we're getting close here
aren't we so one thing that's still left
for us to install aside from our second
graphics card is our hard drive now we
can actually install hard drive cages in
all these guys up here and they're all
included with the case but frankly these
two that's it under the shroud are
enough for I would think most people
anyway
I mean who installs like seven hard
drives in their systems anymore and I
just rather have the cooling from these
fans rather than a bunch of hard drives
here especially with these graphics
cards never a dull moment if you're into
PC's being built okay what the hell what
just I can't get this back together oh
ok well that back together are you doing
ok alright we are getting really friggin
close here this is exciting this is
where I start singing come a little bit
closer baby alright here we go so this
is it this is the this is the PC
building money shot really when you
insert the second graphics card do glue
take off the protector and I did you
think I knew you know in Japan have this
expression that even dogs run into
telephone posts where is their TX bridge
because you should not fasten it all the
way because remember who might have to
move the cars there on your but you're
right I remember in the old studio when
you had like power wiring to the
server's running under a faucet and it
wasn't the rain disconnected yes
look I'm not proud of it see this one
looks a little bit like us like a
Starfighter yeah like a three slot one
would be fighting a dog fighting a quad
slot one which one would win and video
because they're just competing with
itself
okay that's not bad wall there okay no
seriously give me a hand operator okay
like I'm I'm gonna have a heart attack
like see you got to respect the hardware
like and he's a gem sit in there son
yeah good yeah it's beautiful look at
this thing I mean if you're gonna be the
fastest system you might as well do it
in style right oh wow I can't reach the
peel
yeah the tab for the peel came off but
not the oh man zero zero out of ten
worst peel oh come on look he's he's
bitching me out about this yes because
like you know you need to hear the
proper building practices thank you
their mother it's like every town barber
right I'll make it pretty
say no more fam where else do you know
who carries a 24-pin are inches freakin
pork at all times all right so this is
it we are basically their back of the
system as cable managed enough and the
front looks absolutely fantastic so I'm
gonna clear the desk Ivan's gonna grab
our one-percenter gaming peripherals and
we are pretty much ready to go
okay so our keyboard isn't quite one
percenter but I think this G 703 shirt
will call that it's pretty alright just
making sure it looks good for the moment
of truth
you want to hit the power button at the
back so on
look at that memory oh good this is like
full swagger and we got a post on first
attempt one can say that you've got mail
get both nope
aren't there ninjas fighting on that
screen on the motherboard and that is
the favorite part of my of this build
look the dragon defeats the ninjas while
freaking dabbing all right we got to
close up the side panel because if we're
gonna believe that this thing doesn't
thermal throttle we have to actually
push it can you please stop calling this
machine an it okay it's a she it's a she
all right stress test this is for Kings
okay one ready for oh my god yeah
so we're back at defaults there's just a
couple things we need to do we need to
change the SATA mode to raid / octane
mode and we are going to enable our XMP
profile to see what happens hopefully
that'll work
I thought friends don't let friends
enable XMP profiles generally they don't
but come on we put 4000 megahertz ram in
here let's see if it can do it and it
crashed
hmm is this where I get to told you so
about XMP I remember having the craziest
conversation with someone from a soos
when I was like yeah I hate XMP and
they're like why I was like maybe why
cuz it doesn't work most of the time
overwhelming majority of the time it's
also possible that was just some random
glitch because this didn't have any
hiccups so far you know there was no
such thing as around the right even
random number generators and what yeah
here we go
its Soviet Russia right it's just like
you think over by K alright just just
cut maybe he'll stop this is kind of
incredible man like I think I've seen
one or two dips below 60fps a guy I've
never seen this benchmark run this
smoothly so we're gonna get the score
any moment now and the goal is that this
is the PC for the 1%
it's over 10k over 10k well over 10k
what no oku pius alive 98 the 2% there's
probably a little more we can do here
let's go increase our power limit to 125
I think this core is good for about plus
a hundred or so what's it
we had a profile Oh before oh yeah
there's our profile let's try again to
try again
2% you know that one graphics card in
there is worth more than my entire PC
setup
did you know that one graphics card in
there is worth more than my entire PC
setup this is looking higher and no
crash yet and we just broke 11,000 time
to compare online show me that 1% baby
here
98% come on okay what if you boosted the
CPU clocks a little bit behind you guys
make a difference on this simulation all
right all right all right all right
let's do it
okay so we're going to 4.8 gigahertz
we're gonna try and keep our memory at
3,600 and that's a lot of things to
change in one go open up all settings we
reset to default values
goodbye extreme memory profile hello
maybe gonna boot we are now running at
4.8 gigahertz locked across the course
across all course let's fire up the CPU
z
all right here we go
those lights time temps still very
comfortable that was like 11 point oh
come on
well I'm not expecting this to be any
better because why would you but
whatever there it is 98 okay fine we'll
push your last 15 megahertz here and see
if that makes the difference if this
doesn't do it we don't have a lot left
in the tank what 30 more points or
something I doubt that's gonna be the
difference here and it isn't now let's
try some actual games shall we so what
do you think shadow the Tomb Raider
graphics oh trap with motion blur off 4k
120 Hertz s maa
let's see where we end up here before
that though I'd like to share a computer
joke with you what happened to the PC
enthusiast whose side panel got all
scratched up he lost his temper I don't
get it
damn that's smooth we might just have to
run the benchmark though but like holy
crap I just noticed the oppressors
playing graphics you got going what the
hell oh whoa okay never mind yeah you
can what 4k and this is fully maxed out
with except no motion blur because most
are bad yes I don't think I've ever seen
a counter break two digits I'm holy here
I feel all sacks that is unreal no this
is a tomb raider what do you see that
cracked 200 F not for long but we
cracked 200 FPS for a sec there I've
never been so enraptured by this
benchmark run and they're up tchard yeah
it's a wood yes oh well no that's not no
no that wasn't my okay I wasn't I wasn't
making jokes I was I was serious it
feels like this is unreal
and 28 FPS at 4k I mean this makes me
feel a little better about you know not
being in the 1% with you mark and what's
really cool about this is that we
actually did experience reasonable like
not amazing but reasonable sli scaling
across a variety of titles so once
you're cranking it up 4k ultra you've
got your envy link bridge dual r-tx 20
ATT eyes yeah it's a gaming experience
unlike any other it was still a lot of
fun to build something that slab
engineering in our defense though we
knew that wasn't gonna stay there we did
again okay so we didn't achieve our goal
top 1% 3d mark times by extreme but it
was still a lot of fun just being
hands-on with just experiencing the best
of the best of what exists today this is
an absolutely phenomenal machine even if
it's only on the top 2 percent of times
by extreme and something to bear in mind
is that the top 2 percent of times by
extreme is well within the top 1 percent
worldwide anyway so that's what I'm
gonna tell myself to make myself feel
better so a big thank you to be quiet
for sponsoring this endeavor we learned
a lot like that you definitely need the
additional spacing between r-tx 20 ATT
eyes so that was fun and thanks to you
