gentlemen this is a bit of a tail in
between my legs show and I'll be talking
about that in a little bit more detail
later but we made a video that you guys
didn't like very much and I feel like I
need to address that YouTube also rolled
out some new stuff new copyright claim
system and new monetization efforts
which is cool and there's some other
kind of general you know Intel's doing
some rumery stuff and entender switch
light was announced and other fun things
we've actually got a lot of great topics
for you guys today
jonno did the land show document and
well he also did it last week which is
part of the reason that we didn't really
didn't have anything to talk about last
week that's okay because I gave him some
coaching this week and you checked in
with me about the topics ahead of time
and I think there's actually some some
discussion meat in here there's a bit of
a non controversy which to me in and of
itself is kind of controversial so AMD
said that PCI Express Gen 4 would not
work on previous generation motherboards
and then asus went out and published a
list of previous gen boards that it'll
work on and it's it's a funny thing
because I think that AMD fanboys aren't
really gonna like my take on this but my
my feeling is that if the same thing had
happened with Intel people would be
shrieking about it and now that it's
happening with AMD it's like oh that's
pretty cool
so let's get let's get to them first
let's go ahead and roll the intro and
we'll chat about these topics in a
little bit here all right
ah okay is it just one kind of looks
like it was just wine and back to us
okay so um why don't we jump right into
the video that we uploaded today so this
is something that I've actually
addressed on the land show in the past
I'm just gonna fire it up on my laptop
here hopefully my my screen sharing is
working here there we go value noise
cancelling headphones so there were a
couple of things that went wrong today
I'm watching it you can do yeah thank
you appreciate that so a couple of
things that went wrong today first of
all oh yeah
the video went up with entirely the
wrong title okay yes we see that there's
a little bit of lag on the YouTube
stream we are now sort of way beyond I'm
not having an explanation for it because
the entire windchill PC has been swapped
out there's a CPU GPU yeah and it's even
we used to be on x264 encoding and now
we're on n bank actually be any
different than it is now we are back on
the old Ethernet cable yeah also the
like retransmitting server that's at the
splitter there was like some a little
bit of funky there but that's all been
updated and fixed and working and was
tested for the last half hour on a
separate account yeah so it's starting
to get to the point where Robert by the
way know you're super chat is not
pre-recorded so it's starting to get to
the point where it's just like not
really funny anymore yeah we're just
gonna have to power through the show
here though guys realistically twitch is
probably better so you can head over to
twitch and watch there we still have no
explanation for why that would be yep
anyway so I'm gonna go ahead and pull up
the video that we did today so this
video was called and this was mistake
number one it was called why is
everybody buying these headphones which
was actually just one of those complete
bonehead errors and I'm not going to
throw anyone under the bus but I think
we can all guess who it is that usually
makes those particularly egregious
errors
the channel and never actually does get
fired because I love him so much anyway
someone grabbed the wrong title I have
no idea where it came from I actually
did see that that title was on the
pre-release video file but I didn't
really think anything of it I thought
maybe just one of the editors was
confused about it and named the file
that and that like the file name is not
generally interesting to do with the
actual name of the video once we go live
but somehow it ended up with the name of
a series that we run on the channel
why is everybody buying this ex that has
never been sponsored before whether it's
sponsored by the retailer that we got it
from or sponsored by the the products
that we featured it has never been
sponsored before by either of those two
parties like third-party sponsors sure
you know your savage turkey or whatever
the case may be so that created
initially a ton of confusion and a ton
of upset because all of a sudden we had
a sponsored showcase video to see
whatever corner it is right there
sponsored by Tao Tronics that seems to
be disguised as editorial content
something that we actually work really
hard to not have happen which is why
thankfully at least at the beginning I
actually I'm not sure I believe the word
showcase was already in there but it is
supposed to be so if there's a video
that is just like here's information
about a product but it's sponsored by
that company or by that product or by
somewhere to get it it is supposed to be
clearly displayed in the title of the
video so that you know and in the video
as it is down in whatever corner I'm
supposed to oh it's not even there that
way my corner sponsored by tow truck
okay so that was problem number one that
people had with the video as soon as
Nick was actually the one who spotted it
as soon as Nick saw that the title
wasn't right he had it changed this is
what it was supposed to be value
noise-canceling headphones sound surge
46 showcase okay
oops you know so that one's pretty
straightforward whoops are bad the other
one is a little bit more difficult to
address and I feel like I'm almost gonna
to do a complete video talking about
this at some point in the future because
there seems to be a lot of confusion in
people's minds about the way that we
handle our sponsored content so we made
the decision it must have been about a
year ago now to start doing what we
called showcases which are essentially
what most of the rest of the industry
that is YouTube personalities is doing
where essentially there's some product
or some service and there's a
sponsorship involved and you're
basically given a bullet point list of
things to say about it
so our way of reconciling that because
obviously that's not editorial content
that's not you know my opinion the way
that we reconciled that was okay here's
the deal
audience we're gonna do these but we're
gonna do them as extra releases so the
you know just this video went up on a
Friday so instead of the Linus tech tips
channel getting six normal videos plus
wine show for a total of seven that's
one every day it was actually six normal
videos Plus this 1 plus wine show so
there were a total of eight videos so we
didn't want these sponsored showcases
this sponsored content to interfere with
our regular upload schedule we didn't
want you guys to feel like you were
getting cheated and you were missing out
on an editorial or a project-based piece
of content because we had decided to do
one of these showcases so that was
number one
well you didn't want it to affect the
volume of content that you guys get that
is our usual type number two was we
wanted to separate our opinion which
cannot be purchased from airtime on our
channel which can be purchased so when I
talk about buying air time you are in
much the same way that you would sponsor
a podcast or a radio show you are paying
for the host to read your talking points
be at about savage turkey Ridge wallet
the elgato stream deck or you know any
number of other other
brands and products that have sponsored
our show yeah LT acts so the distinction
then is you can pay for words to be said
but you cannot pay for an opinion so
that's where I feel like people are
really allowing the waters to get
muddied in their minds between reviews
and sponsored videos so a lot of the
complaints about this video aside from
the ones about the title being wrong and
it really was that was absolutely our
mistake and we're sorry that's our bad a
lot of the complaints are that we didn't
give an opinion this is this is a you
know I could hear I'm just gonna I'm
gonna scroll down and find something
here because I'm sure it won't be that
hard okay here's one that I pinned
because I did respond to him
so what other than the requested
sponsored talking points can you give us
anything of your own or are you just
reading off their marketing material the
answer is I am reading off their
marketing material and when it comes to
any of their sponsored piece of content
so are they that's how it works
anytime I were to give you guys an
opinion in a sponsored piece of content
I'm not talking about like picking it up
like so here's a ridge wallet you know
it's made of carbon fiber feels pretty
solid I'm demonstrating that it's solid
yes I'm saying it feels pretty solid to
me or whatever but that is that that is
a demonstrably objective fact it's it's
really well built that's not really an
opinion even though it's being presented
in the form of an opinion and so anytime
we are giving and if we were to give
opinions in our sponsored content then
we create a really awkward and a really
dangerous crossover between a review and
that is a word that we use very
carefully a review cannot be sponsored
by the subject of the review because
there is an inherent obvious conflict of
interest that prevents any information
in that review from being taken
it's face value so we keep a review
separate from a sponsored showcase
because yes that is exactly what a
sponsored video is now some sponsors in
fact taotronics was one of them do allow
us to give you guys useful information
we did mention some of the more negative
points of those headphones in the video
and in fact we've run into this a lot of
the time especially brands that where
they're their big kid pants and are
willing to take criticism will even
allow it in a sponsored video but what
you guys need to understand is that
every brand taotronics Cisco Intel AMD
Nvidia anyone that we've ever worked
with over the years has a say in a
sponsored piece of content so anything
that is in that finished video and this
goes not just for us but any channel
that you watch at least the ones were at
least they disclose it any channel you
watch that does a sponsored video the
brands that sponsored it had to say and
if there was something they didn't like
it was probably removed depending on the
contract I would say with 98% certainty
that would have been removed I mean
there are going to be creators out there
that have more power that have more
weight to throw around say no this is my
artistic vision it stays and we've been
able to throw that weight around a fair
number of times but sometimes it doesn't
work or the contract isn't favorable or
whatever the case may be so clear about
it not working just because I feel like
this could get misconstrued in some way
if it doesn't work the video just
doesn't come out it's not like he'll say
something that he strongly doesn't
believe in and release the video anyways
just he's like well they strong-armed to
me the video just won't come out and the
contract will not be made and that has
happened yeah
like has 100% happened yes so then so
you know addressing a few more of the
most up voted comments here because I
feel like this is a really important
topic not just on our channel but in
general it's something that's really
important for you guys to understand so
why is everyone okay knowing yesterday
that was about the title it's super this
is an ad with no actual content WTF yes
that's why it says sponsored by tell
Onix and that's why it says okay
in the title because at the end of the
day that's basically what it is and the
WTF is this was an extra piece of
content we labeled it with showcase
after the fact and I'm really sorry
about that we labeled it with showcase
if you don't want to see it don't watch
it that really is our stance on them
something I want to throw in personally
as a technically outside person on this
is I hadn't watched this at all sat here
and watched part of it before the show
there are parts of the video where you
criticize it I know you mentioned this
earlier people are saying there's
literally no points that aren't in the
sponsor spot there's like no way that's
true because they're not gonna put in
the sponsor spot hey this button is I
don't member exactly how you word it but
not great and takes a little bit getting
used to that's not gonna be in the
sponsor spot so that yeah I hear you
guys but so this is this is another
really great example right here of
exactly the mentality that we need to we
need to kill
I don't mind sponsored videos but this
was just a 4-minute ad there was no
review or anything if it's sponsored
there is no review period that's not how
these contracts work and you don't want
them to work that way no you don't you
want reviews to be really really clearly
separated from anything that is
sponsored in a way that could create a
conflict of interest absolutely that's
like very important so yeah I mean most
of the complaints probably the most
blatant clickbait title I've seen nobody
not a single soul - everybody is buying
it and that's that's fair coz the
original title is crazy I I will throw
another defendant that yeah - Media
Group has published like what thousands
of videos at this point there's gonna be
up season titles every once in a while
it's so bad this one is particularly so
particularly bad it wasn't just it
didn't sort of it didn't just violate
our own standards for what constitutes
clickbait yeah it violates our our
editorial oh it's bad all I'm saying is
people will make mistakes so we're clear
that it's bad oh it's bad it's really
dumb but like I wouldn't and pointing it
out
you know what solid because it needs to
be pointed out so that it gets change
etc etc etc
but like I don't know I'd measure your
pitch for goodness because it was
changed quickly Oh surprise Lucas
defending LMG well no crap I think it's
also very reasonable there was a mistake
they understood it was a mistake to
change the title these showcase content
has been happening forever there are
legitimate criticisms within a showcase
video which in my opinion is marginally
above and beyond
I mean there were a couple of things
that we felt were really important to
mention yeah like the fact that you know
what they sound pretty darn good I'm not
being sponsored right now say whatever
the hell I want they sound pretty darn
good but not at full volume someone
mentioned that in the comments in that I
hadn't seen that part of the video but
yeah someone mentioned that in twitch
chat that you guys said that as well
like that's there there was extra stuff
added onto so we we mentioned the main
drawbacks of them like to be clear
they're fine we wouldn't have taken the
deal if we thought they were a bad deal
also there's a bunch of content
especially earlier on when if you
watched Lance's videos from quite a long
time ago when we used to do more
headphone coverage obviously unboxings
he's mirroring the same comment these
are opinions he's had for a long time
not that opinions shouldn't be able to
change over time but like a lot of the
things that you said we're not
surprising to me as I remember holding a
dinky camera and listening to you say
the same stuff now I have had people
upset particularly about the fact that I
didn't Rahman it for having a micro B
USB port so I can explain why that would
be the cost to implement USB type-c is
significantly higher not just in terms
of the actual solder connections because
there are more of them and they're finer
but in terms of the Rd because it is a
more complex standard by complex
standard I mean it is like many
different standards many of which don't
necessarily work properly with each
other building a device that charges
over a USB type-c is not trivial and
there's a reason that even large
companies like Logitech are still
shipping gaming mice with USB micro-b
connectors now with someone like
Logitech I have less sympathy because
Luke has personally visited their R&amp;amp;D
facility
I think they can figure out how to put a
USB type-c connector on yeah they're
kind of amazing actually
with taotronics given the price point
and given the fact that what is a device
like this would not have as clear a
benefit from type-c as some others would
like a mouse in particular now Logitech
mitigates this somewhat by putting
reinforcements around their type-c
connectors at the end of their mice so
it doesn't put as much strain on it but
with a device like a mouse where you're
actually moving it around while it's
charging sometimes there's a clear and
obvious reason to use a more durable
connector like a type see this is a pair
of headphones that you'll probably
charge once every few days for a span of
a couple years until you lose them or
whatever so micro-b yeah it's not as
good but it doesn't need fast charging
over type-c like it doesn't need you
know 30 watt charging or anything crazy
like that it would be more convenient to
not have to carry an extra cable but
they are a value option as opposed to a
you know 199 or $2.99 pair of active
noise-cancelling headphones so I was
willing to be I was willing to not ream
on it and there's no way again remember
this is a sponsored piece of content
there's no way I was going to be able to
ream on it hard because this is a
sponsored piece of content so why wasn't
it in there because given the context I
was willing to not ream on it and I
wouldn't have been able to ream on it
anyway all right well I think that's
pretty much all I have to say about that
yeah oh speaking of all I have to say
about that I ate at Bubblegum's for the
first time ever yesterday public gums
yes oh Donen okay yeah yes I actually I
and while I was sitting there I just I
was down in LA for a meeting that was to
do with VidCon but I wasn't at VidCon
because I left before VidCon started
that sounds like the best way to do
VidCon yeah hands down it was kind of
amazing I had like the best meeting ever
I'm so bad with names and I'm really
embarrassed and so this sucks but CGP
grey was there Tom Scott was there
youtubes head of search and
discoverability was there
which was really important and there
were definitely some key insights that
this is not the kind of meeting that I
can go and like make a youtube video
about and tell you guys all about but it
was it was really good to just be able
to have that kind of open discussion
around the dinner table there was a I
think her first name's Rebecca she's
absolutely huge
she does kids content I forget their
last names a mole oh it's a Malo
something like that there was a guy who
has a really cool channel that's like
tips for creators there was the guy who
did the the arcade arcade tricks are
like arcade cheats or something like
that
arcade hacks cheats or something
what's his what's his name shoot Rebecca
is em all oh yeah yeah that's her
so she's it's not the kind of content
that I think you folks would necessarily
enjoy but she's super popular yeah dang
it I can't I can't find I can't find him
right now
nobody is nobody is helping me in the
chat mark Robert Mutt mark Robert mark
Robert he was okay arcade scam sciences
yeah so he was there
so it was like honestly I felt kind of
Buist but I think I got an invite just
because I cornered one of their execs at
at the top creator summit and was like
asking a bunch of questions and he was
just like we're thinking to have it like
a dinner I'll come to that and talk to
these people directly so it's really
cool I'm finally getting to the point
where we have a real relationship with
YouTube actually one one of the people
who was there got to launch a popular
product for the first time in pretty
much forever and that leads really
perfectly into one of our topics for
today oh so the head of Content ID was
actually at dinner oh yeah this is cool
yeah okay yeah so the original article
here is from the YouTube creators blog
and he was really excited about this so
content ID now requires claimants to
provide more information and provides
better they're going to displace hey
that's the benefit of durable aluminum
wall hangings you can trip and throw
them all over the floor and they'll
still be okay alright are they bad okay
cool no no that's fine yeah it wasn't it
wasn't that bad anyway so better so
better tools to resolve manual Content
ID claims so this actually would have
solved that drama problem that we had a
while back yeah where our Content ID
system through our MCN was claiming
anyone's video that had I think it was
either Unigine Valley or Unigine Heaven
benchmark in it because we had lots of
videos with that first apparently and
then other people uploaded footage and
it went that's Linus Media Group's
content and then they had their videos
Content ID claims which to be clear is
not the same thing as a copyright - yeah
and is actually no big deal once you get
it resolved there's no long-term lasting
damage you don't even lose your adsense
anyway now it's way easier to resolve
these things so in the past the
copyright claim system had been abused
and used to extort creators in some
cases so manual claiming is a tool
within Content ID that allows you to do
things like go hey YouTube's automated
system didn't find this six notes of our
song and you know automatically flag it
so we're gonna go in we're gonna
manually say hey that's from our song we
actually had this happen a while back
with a monitor video we had like a meme
and it was basically like data and like
it was really that short and the owner
of that song came in they've created
their own tools for combing through
videos they came in they claimed our
entire video based on this like six to
eight notes of music or whatever it was
the way that a copyright claim works is
that once someone else claims your video
the video stays up you lovely folks
still get to enjoy it but all of the
money that gets made through Adsense on
that video goes to that copyright holder
even if they had nothing to do with
99.5% of the video content that it was
just that all of the money goes to them
which is obviously not a perfect system
but I also understand why it would be
that way because you know you can't just
you can't just grab like you know an
iconic song like ac/dc highway to hell
or something and use you know five to
ten seconds of it in every one of your
videos and expect that that's okay
because you didn't create that that's
not yours it doesn't work that way yeah
and you also can't just tell ac/dc
well hey these guys put three hours of
black frames at the end of their video
which makes you effectively Oh point
zero two percent of the content so here
0.02 percent of the absense that's not
fair either because clearly you the
creator felt you were significantly
enhancing your piece of content by
stealing someone else's work or you
wouldn't have included it I mean in that
case you definitely did sorry you
definitely did but if you put three
hours of black frames oh yeah yeah
you're definitely you're significantly
enhancing your content yeah so so anyway
to combat and so this is this is a move
in the creator's direction after a lot
of previous moves that appeared to be
designed to help copyright holders
enforce their copyright to a degree that
I as a youtuber felt was unfair we ended
up having to edit that video and
re-upload it without that meme in it
because giving someone else all the
adsense from a video that we spend a lot
of time and money creating for their
couple seconds of music doesn't make any
sense to us so now here's what's here's
what's going on so Content ID can work
automatically by scanning a blah blah
blah okay so
umm-hmm okay jaw nose notes on this are
not amazing but basically starting today
and I think that's two days ago three
days ago they are requiring copyright
owners to provide timestamps to indicate
exactly where their content appears in
the videos that they manually claimed
which is nice this was a big product
story like in that video I watched
through the entire video without
actually realizing what the problem was
all I could see was that it had been
claimed by some music conglomerate and I
was like what are you talking about so I
iMessage to our editor I went yo WTF
what happened here aren't we using all I
think we were on Warner Chappell at a
time like aren't we using all licensed
music that we we have rights for and
they go yeah and then someone finally
clued in I think it was actually a
comment on the video that alerted us to
this that that that meme was from a song
like that little portion of it and so so
it wasted a bunch of our time when the
claimant could have just said hey this
is the problem now they don't want to do
that because that's not actually the
outcome thereafter think about it from
their perspective would they rather have
you quickly edit their crap out of your
video or would they rather take your
money in the they get 100% of it kind of
scheme they definitely just want the
money beam is definitely the right word
here yeah so they have to provide
timestamps now for exactly which part of
your video is manually being claimed and
YouTube is providing their editing tools
to remove the content claimed manual in
your video which will now automatically
release the claims this isn't gonna
solve all problems no but it should be
way more helpful than what they have now
yep so right now you've got a few
different options you can mute all sound
when the claim song plays you can
replace the song if you don't want to
mute the audio entirely so you can
instead swap out the music with one of
they're free to use songs from the
YouTube audio library although it might
not necessarily be a perfect solution we
actually had some lame a YouTube audio
library song once because the
performance was licensed by YouTube but
the actual original sheet music was
still copyrighted in Germany
of all places anyway or you can trim out
the content so you can just cut it out
and then an edited version will show up
on YouTube after the fact and they are
still working on improvements like
having an explicit trim option in the
video copyright info page that will
allow you to trim it out with just one
click and remember of course that the
same tools from before where you could
dispute these claims do still exist if
you think the claim is incorrect or
covered under fair use or just
completely irrelevant like those Unigine
Valley and Unigine Heaven claims you can
just say hey this is invalid here's the
reason I think so and we've actually
found that most of the time like when
show we've been flagged on when show a
lot of times back when we used to show
game trailers yeah we've been flagged by
the game trailer owners and I'm kind of
sitting here going you effing serious
mate so dumb you're gonna take our money
for promoting yours are we advertised
yeah sorry for the free promotion
dumbass so we've actually disputed those
in the past saying I'm sure this was an
accident no one in their right mind at
Nintendo would be mad that I showed
their trailer Nintendo definitely gets
salty about that I actually do think
that Nintendo was one that did not
release it and I'm sure they were I'm
looking at it going like you guys are
just idiots because we are just never
ever ever going to talk about one of
your new games again they're giving a
job lightly better at this over time
you're getting slightly better but like
wow yeah yeah it's like how stupid do
you have to be to get mad at someone for
promoting a trailer for your car this is
an awesome looking game check it out
flagged we might not have said it looked
awesome
we probably did it's a Nintendo game we
probably did well they're basically all
awesome yeah on the subject of Nintendo
one more topic before we do our sponsors
light yea or nay yea yea absolutely you
know what you know what I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna tempt the gods we'll see if
his shoe takes the whole video yeah
we'll see what do you think do you
discreetly um I don't I I wasn't
listening I was busy
I said yay you said yay yeah why it's
considerably cheaper it's a hundred
and it's effectively a 3ds replacement
okay which like they weren't gonna keep
going with 3ds and we've known that for
a long time okay so I'm gonna say it's
complicated okay I see we're going here
okay so go ahead yeah these prices are
all over the place for one so I'm not a
hundred cents sure what's going on there
the one that I saw that's price
competitive with the switch light and I
would be concerned about use switches
are a little bit sketchy that's true
green
they could be blacklisted you have an
exposed screen yeah it's fairly likely
for the screens to be scratched
especially if people were not very
careful careful with docking them yeah
and that's gonna be something that might
be a little bit visually hard to tell in
an eBay ad it has a not very easily user
replaceable battery yeah so I would be a
little bit concerned about that and I
don't think the fact that you can eBay
something that is used for a comparable
price that a new thing is like null and
void no but maybe an enthusiast can take
it factored in a purchasing decision for
me I'm not gonna purchase a switch light
okay I think it's cool that it's on the
mark here's my other main problem
yeah that's bestbuy.com so that's u.s.
pricing sure so to me effectively what
Nintendo has done here is they've
knocked $100 off the price and you're
getting the same gaming hardware so
you're gonna have the same gaming
experience that you had at least on
mobile anyway the battery life is a
little longer is it as far as I know
it's an updated chipset I think it's a
new tiger chip I believe so the battery
life is a little bit longer the
controllers are fixed so they're stuck
on the side and I believe the screens a
little smaller I don't know about the
screen I'm not sure but okay so here's
my problem is they dropped $100 off the
price yes that's nice
but you are giving up a lot we have TV
docking and removal controllers some of
it you have the ability to get back like
for example there are games that you
cannot play on the switch light like
mario party for example mario party
requires joy cons so if you can connect
the joy constitutes which late of course
you can for $70 oh yeah okay but you
said you cannot play
so now you've spent two hundred and
seventy dollars it is another $30 thirty
bucks to get the one that just has all
the functionality that's where i run
into trouble this is a this is a console
that is a switch no but it doesn't offer
all the same experiences it's more like
a gameboy it's not really a console yes
it doesn't talk I know you can't play it
on TV I know I know it's not really
designed I here yet it's not really
designed for Mario Party for thirty
bucks
look I've I've played more Mario Party
on the switch portably than I have on my
TV oh that's kind of weak on the plane
why do you play Mario for Alan you
played Mario yourself no well someone
with someone okay okay okay yeah I
played a party a fairly small use case
okay that's an issue I don't disagree
with you but but there I mean there's
other getting the Nintendo acknowledged
in their announcement that you can't
play one place all of them yeah yeah
like there are games it won't play
you've got to check the back of the game
you got to see if it supports a handheld
mode and if it doesn't you are the
quantum fast majority of games are gonna
support it yes special party Mario Party
is a good one to call out because that's
a fairly made I don't know how many
party game it's a lot of fun yes I don't
know how many people are into one to
switch yeah kind of a trash game no
Mario Party is pretty major yes I will
give you that if I have to run out and
spend $70 on top of the facts so here's
another problem that I have first party
Nintendo games are freaking expensive so
when we're talking about the price
difference between a switch and a switch
light we're talking one and a half games
yep but at the same time like if you're
a kid that one and a half games might be
too much yeah that's a man you should
probably go buy a you should probably go
try to very much snipe
good deal on a used switch somewhere
else I do agree with that not everyone's
gonna do that a lot of Mom's fine use
I'm not gonna buy you a use which a lot
of mom's not comfortable buying you
stuff for their kid who you know even if
they're like a like I'm you know I get
this story all the time like hey Linus
my mom won't let me buy a used GPU on
eBay because she says it's it's it's
sketchy I know it's a good deal it's
like it it's it's one of those brands
that still have that has a user
transferable warranty it's literally
still under warranty help me convince
and I'm like look dude there's nothing I
can do to help convince you I couldn't
convince my parents you're not gonna be
able to convince yours I bet yeah my mom
was pretty cool with that we my brother
and I raised money and she drove us to
buy ass nests from some dude in a
parking lot when I was like 11 or
something but like but not everyone's
down with that yeah I don't think it's a
smoking deal I don't think it's amazing
I think it has a place though right a
lot of people aren't gonna buy you some
people might want to just play fire
emblem and smash and literally nothing
else but if you're good okay
people will buy a device for that
conscious mobile you don't want to dock
it people will buy a condo well Russia's
invalid Brandon please come on okay okay
so Brandon you're a bit of a smash
enthusiast yes I like smash okay so
we're talking switch versus switch lay
right now okay so do you know okay so at
$100 Delta okay is the switch light a
deal I didn't say it's a smoking deal I
said ahead of place I think it had yeah
I think I agree with Luke I think it has
okay so if you were someone who's only
gonna play fire emblem and smash yes is
it not worth the extra hundred dollars
to be able to dock this isn't fair
because Brandon has a suite I literally
bought a switch like last week when
for this which light came out now
thinking back to that decision that I
made last week I'd still make this I was
gonna say I think you'd buy first but
again he has a nice TV yeah and a really
awesome couch a lot of people don't have
long you don't need to have a TV jeez
your monitor you can absolutely sure
there's so many monitors but a lot of
people are just gonna want to like chill
in bed play only thing I see they do
they not have for a lot of kids don't
have a valid question it's fair but like
I smashed by themselves sometimes that
hundred-dollar Delta will be too much
that's you overcome but then I stand by
my argument that you should go buy a
used foot some people kit because you're
gonna you're okay you might not need joy
cons eventually but okay here's another
thing to like if you want to talk resale
value the switch so we're gonna hold its
value it's gonna hold some of that value
when it's time to flip it and get a
switch to be fair basically all Nintendo
products hold value very well and and
the accessories the weird
so accessories for original wheeze I
know I was picking no some of them not
bad
like the tennis racquet things okay no
no not that's that's what I'm talking
like wiimotes yeah we motionplus
wiimotes still hold values yeah the Wii
U I was picking up a Wii U a little
while ago because one of our wheeze like
was having some kind of issue and I was
like I you know what forget it let's
just get a Wii U anyway and then I can
do that
data transfer thing and then I don't
have to worry about the Wii dying and
taking all my you know classic arcade
whatever this virtual console games with
it and all that kind of stuff so we got
and I was like shocked at how much a Wii
U still cost because because because of
the way that Nintendo manages their IP
and they have these unique games gaming
experience with your tablet controller
still feels amazing yep so they've got
these unique experiences that are
available their consoles hold their
value I would make the argument that a
switch light is going to go like that
compared to a switch which will still
hold some down comparatively I still
think we'll hold this value better than
a lot of things yeah but yeah I do agree
with that in general I think I do think
like I think you're maybe under
estimating the hundred-dollar Delta yeah
I think for a lot of kids that's a
really big
it's big my problem is potentially a
year but it's gonna bite you later it's
been only when you need joy cons it's
gonna bite you're also going to
eventually go on sale get combo'd with a
game okay like that okay now that's a
different conversation if it comes with
Fire Emblem and it's like 229 now we're
talking a two-game difference in price
but right now it is a one and a half
game right now but it's the I think
that's still significant enough to make
people accept these sacrifices sure yeah
they are they are sacrifices in a lot of
cases the increased battery life is
really nice and that might be enough for
some people because charging the switch
is actually a huge pain the switch being
fully mobile is actually very annoying
it is yeah how's it a pain charging the
switches its battery life he's not very
good yeah it's very life is tariffs yeah
but I mean okay so maybe yeah maybe I'm
a unique case but now you're throwing in
a surprisingly expensive battery banks
hold on a second I fine okay so let me
think for you know what though one thing
I use my laptop charger so I carry one
USB type-c yeah
I carry my razor blade stealth laptop
charger which does my phone my switch
and my laptop and they all last for long
enough that I don't even know there's
three of this kid that was barely able
to save up for well has a razor blade
with a USB C charging I'm just tired
I haven't found charging the device to
be a problem yeah it's a little awkward
a lot of people who buy a switch light
are not gonna go along and also buy a
lot of the stuff that you need to make
like that could make the switch to TV
version better that's true button so
like switch light is a good solution
because they they're not gonna spend
like because I think I I spent like
another hundred dollars on little things
SD cards and like like pro controller
yeah that's the thing when you buy
switch for your TV you're buying a lot
of other stuff on top of that yeah a lot
of the time over time and like I switch
like you just kind of just play right
away somewhat bridge the gap alright
thanks Brendon by buying some of those
things like additional controllers and
stuff and I think you have to assume if
you're going for a switch light you're
probably buying
nothing in addition other than games all
right well that's fair enough
so you're in you're the plan is to
invest a lot less than the ecosystem and
if I was a parent maybe I'd get my kids
to switch light so that they don't have
to ask me for a pro controller honestly
that might sell a bunch of these if the
people are educated enough in the
ecosystem to go like okay yeah it can't
connect to the TV it can't do all these
other things or if I don't want my kids
on my TV or that so okay all right I
think it has a place I don't think it's
a stunning value I don't think people
should run out and buy it right now
because it's amazing I think you're
interested I would probably wait until
like it's bundled with a game with a
game yeah with a game okay without a
game I think it's a I think it's a tough
sell for me I don't think it's a great
deal
I don't lightly it's interesting I don't
like saving a dollar so that I can spend
too later okay but a hundred US dollars
when you were 13 yeah it's a lot of
money but what I know you probably would
have been I was not on the same thing I
bought low sold high I was flipping
stuff on Craigslist like I was hustling
yeah so I had a joke like I don't feel
bad yeah for people that can't raise
$100 because they're like right young
Ted because again I had a job but I can
understand why they might want to buy
now to be clear I just said just now
could sound very out of touch to be
clear I don't feel bad for like suburban
lower to upper middle-class kids yeah
that can't scrape together $100 if you
came from where we came from yes
then you should be able to yeah but if
you're someone who is in a situation
where like you can't you don't even have
time to go to school because you are
like working to support your family at
12 or whatever that's a completely
different since I wasn't supporting my
family with my job oh yeah buying
EverQuest subscriptions and so I just
want to make sure that that's really
clear yes thank you just just for those
of you who are tuning in late we have no
idea why the stream is lagging on
YouTube it's fine on twitch it is
literally the same stream so actually
still lags a little bit on Twitch but it
is considerably
okay so yeah we'll have to figure that
out later yeah we think it's haunted
just wanted to run through small sirs
for you guys holy crap we are 45 minutes
into the show and we haven't talked
about Anthony did you want to jump in
with something you see worse to kind of
standing there patiently right so okay
yeah Luke said that oh it is smaller
yeah okay yeah it's small it's less like
much smaller like my joy Kahn's don't
stick really well anymore okay so it's
quite a bit smaller but it's okay so
it's still like sort of pocketable yeah
you need a pretty epic pocket no I don't
think so
ah maybe it takes my entire hand yeah
you probably up to like monsters for
today see sonic see Sonic's yes we're
doing it Nick see sonic has lots of
fantastic power supply products
featuring features like wow these are
really confusing things okay so I have
up to 80 plus titanium efficiency the
highest lower is this a specific SKU
we're talking about yes it is but it's
not in here dang it you guys
where's this is it here okay I don't
think so I blame John oh and Colton so
some there's some product from see sonic
baby plus I think um efficiency so
that's between 91 and 94% efficiency at
all times it has their lambda noise
level a plus plus so the noise output
stays below 20 decibels during operation
it's got a fluid dynamic bearing fan
with premium hybrid fan control so the
fan actually turns off when it's under
very low load it's got their micro
tolerance load regulation it comes with
a 12 year warranty and you can check it
out at see Sonic's website or at Amazon
the link in the video description is
Johnno looking for it are you looking
for the power supply that is the sponsor
for today oh we used it for a video the
link okay see sonic prime titanium 850 I
went through the link and found it
alright also sponsoring the show today
original oh that's funny I was talking
about how rich well it might be a
sponsor and then they were I guess
that's why it's sitting here I thought
maybe someone just left it here No
so the ridge wallet lets you stop
carrying pointless garbage around in
your pocket receipts old hotel room keys
spent gift cards all that kind of stuff
if you don't have the space for it then
it's a little bit easier to break the
habit so the ridge wallet is designed
with two metal plates that are bound by
a strong elastic band to keep your cards
tightly together but still easily
accessible they've got a belt clip on
them or you can just slip it into your
pocket it's actually pretty smooth so
you're not gonna have you know I'm gonna
find it like getting caught on things if
you decide not to use the clip and they
are lifetime guaranteed they're also
RFID blocking so you they can't people
can't use like those card skimmers in
order to grab your data out of your
pocket but I will say I'm gonna
interject here for once again if you
need RFID to access something yeah the
way that your well no no the way the
reject cards is actually really simple
and if you just put that card on the
edge hmm you just shove it out with your
thumb tap
shove it back in you're done it's
actually faster in my opinion then than
many normal they come in different
materials like aluminum carbon fiber and
titanium and they're a great gift for
Father's Day which is a month ago so you
can use a fur coat ltte at a Ridge
wallet don't calm slash ltte and you can
save 10% on your very own Ridge wallet
cash clip oh that's a cash clip well
whatever I would I've used it as a belt
clip and it works in other news savage
jerky is also sponsoring the show today
and actually still have a little bit of
sriracha bacon left over where are you
going oh we've got the hot sauce showing
their other fantastic product their
jerky is made with high-quality
ingredients without nitrate
or preservatives with the goal of
creating a snack that is full of flavor
and spice isn't bad for you I was
actually doing some research on nitrates
they're really bad yeah I haven't really
thought about it much before but so
nitrates make it much faster to aged
meat and get that desirable delicious
looking color but there are carcinogen
which is cool what also we have a lot of
meat well actually no sorry just to be
clear then the nitrates are not the
carcinogen it's the reaction between the
nitrates and something something that
creates a carcinogen so they've got 13
different flavors of jerky like their
sriracha bacon and their maple buffalo
bacon which I love Allen's got a little
bit more kick than maple Buffalo I kind
of went down the wrong pipe
I'm good though they also make barbecue
sauce hot sauce and a spice rub and I
love their hot sauce and their hot sauce
is amazing it's like really good you
guys should check it out
use offer code LTTE to save 10% on all
their products at the link below
all right do we have any other important
topics today I kind of feel like we
covered all the like really important
stuff the major things the Google
employees see all this thing end thing
is pretty interesting yeah we don't talk
about the the PCIe gen for compatibility
drama I want to throw anything for this
really quick at some point okay so
Google employees secretly listening and
we don't really have to go into this too
deeply in my opinion there's Google
employees that are listening in to
Google home data and listening to
conversations including conversations
that were definitely not intentionally
triggered I'm sure this is happening
with all of them I was talking a wendel
at Computex we talked about a ton of
stuff Wendell's an amazing person was
very fun hanging out with him but one of
the things we started talking about is
there's someone has designed or a group
of people I don't remember sorry I
didn't remember the story until I saw
this this exact topic but they designed
this 3d printed housing that you can put
on I believe it was for an Alexa but you
could probably put it on a you could
probably modify it to go on a Google
home as well that like covers it and
then has a little I believe if I murkily
it has a little speaker in it that
constantly blares noise at it and it's
called a brain it's playfully called a
brain slug
because that plays on to something from
a show that I don't remember and people
can get really mad at me but I think
it's Rick and Morty so basically it's
constantly blasting like white noise
that Futurama future might be oh I think
it sweet Ram yeah
it's constantly blasting white noise and
the brain slug is now listening for you
but it's all local stuff it doesn't call
out to external servers so if you say
the key word the brain slug wants to
hear the brain slug will stop blasting
noise and then you can talk to your
automation device Wow and that's
actually awesome that is next-level I
think that is so cool and I've wanted to
make one for a while even though I don't
run these devices I just want to make
one so I think they're cool and I
probably screwed some things up and I'm
sorry Wendel and whoever made that
project but super cool so this is pretty
funny Google's defense of this behavior
was that only 0.2 percent of all audio
clips are being used that's a lot that's
a huge amount that's one in every 500
that means I garand like not technically
guaranteed but it is extremely likely
that I have something in here of me
going set a reminder for but you know my
herpes appointment or whatever but
that's the thing highly recognizable
voice so yeah say that he did set an
embarrassing reminder something like
that even if he was intending to talk to
his assistant yeah it's a personal
assistant yeah not a hey I'd love for
someone in in a data center somewhere to
really like listen to this and go wow
that lukla from here the conversation
with Wendel came up because I was
talking about how I don't like these
services because I would love to have
something local and how a long time ago
I had spun up this project to try to
mesh together a whole bunch of
microphones in my house and have them
dictate to a file that I was going to be
constantly reading to see for my own
keywords and triggering events on my own
or all this kind of stuff but it was
quite a long time ago and he actually
said there's a bunch of projects that I
would be able to use to accomplish it a
lot easier now which is very cool again
talking to Wendell is always fantastic
but that's how we got onto this thing
because these are so they're so creepy
Nick you've been standing here very
patiently
you want to talk to the LaLanne show no
I haven't yet
that's the top-selling t-shirt
above hard drive I actually like hard
drive better okay yeah so there you go
processor t-shirt it's for sale it's
really nice I really like it though
there's also this one you can also get
the elemental shirts which I don't sell
very well
this shirt exists yeah check it out
alternatively we're gonna have those to
4:30 at LTX hard drive is hard drives
pretty awesome I really like this one
what else is there to say we're out of
stock it's most of the sizes of stealth
hoodie are we out of all of them there's
only one there's one still there's one
stealth hoodie in stock well it says
sold out online so they'll be back next
week and hopefully by next week we will
also be launching our underwear oh yeah
yes I've already totally I think I think
you'll take anything free oh yeah yes so
can I pitch you something crazy okay to
promote the launch of the underwear yeah
we do the show naked but where where are
we like standing you can't see them
anyways that's fine are we gonna banned
from twitch I don't know
well you how does that work your table
for so we could pay we could pay phone
we could live that's a whole sectional
you could wear bras oh my god we could
wear bras we could wear bra okay but
hold on a second I I need to know how
this works is actually important because
you're a twitch partner so if you show
your nipples on someone else's channel
Oh does that affect your channel yeah
yeah okay so if like doctor disrespect
showed up on - tech yeah em was like
streaming in the bathroom or whatever
that's on him not me temporarily banned
for it all right yeah all right just yes
just clearing the air here just clearing
the air so bras
alright so bras might be the answer I
think actually oh you're not here next
week okay next week then we'll find a
time um yeah all right
Seuss publishes expertise and be 450 Jen
for compatibility chart so let's see
what this was posted by CB forum member
on the Linus tech tips forum and
basically AMD's official position about
PCI Express gen for compatibility has
been that only X 570 and their rise and
third gen processors together give you
the capability to run PCI Express Gen 4
which is double the speed of PCI Express
gen3 at the same link with however a
soos actually just published a chart of
their motherboards so we've got this
here on hexxus net showing that some of
their last generation x 470 and even
their more value oriented be 450 boards
have PCIe gen 4 supporter or capability
so ironically none of their rog boards
have Gen 4 16x support so you know
that's pretty funny but some of their
prime and tough series boards actually
do so you could plug a PCIe Gen for
graphics card into your system and get a
Gen 4 link if you have a rising 3rd gen
processor installed in it and actually
quite a lot of the board's support PCIe
gen 4 for the m dot 2 slot which in my
opinion is actually a little bit more
important because PCIe Gen 4 16x is so
far beyond what a graphics card needs at
this point in time outside of some very
specialized workloads that faster
storage is probably a more practical use
for PCI Jim PCIe gen 4 at this point in
time now what I actually don't have any
clarification on at this point because I
haven't actually read the article is how
this affects the link between the CPU
and the chipset I would imagine that
still a gen 3 link because the chipset
itself is not Gen 4 capable to my
knowledge but for the rest of it the way
that it works is your CPU is just its
PCI Express
pins are just connected to those slots
or to that m2 slot so as long as the
signalling quality is sufficient it can
negotiate a Gen 4 link on these boards
as long as the device on the other end
is PCIe gen 4 it's just it's just copper
like that's what it is it's copper now
the way that they route the traces has
to be better for PCIe Gen 4 so that you
avoid interference and that's why asus
is saying well hey look these boards
aren't going to handle it because of
whatever reason or if you had something
like a PCI Express switch or something
if that doesn't have Gen 4 capability
you're not gonna you're not gonna be
able to necessarily handle actually I
don't know how would a PL x chip be
affected by that I would think it would
have to be natively Gen 4 don't quote me
on that maybe I'll have to get back to
you on that anyway the point is it looks
like there are some boards with PCIe gen
4 capability from the last generation
which kind of eliminates the one key
benefit of X 570 especially cuz a lot of
them are passively cooled ok so I'm
gonna bring you back a little bit yeah
please because you just talked about how
it's very interesting but something you
mentioned at the beginning of the show
was the controversy problem where a lot
of people are going oh cool but you
think if it was the other team they
would be getting really mad yeah so
Intel had something similar where they
had a line of chips that I'm gonna screw
up the code names coffee like so they
had a line of chips that could have
worked on their z170 and z2 70 boards
and intel decided to say no they're not
compatible and because while some boards
would have worked and that was proven
enthusiast members of the community got
coffee like chips working by spoofing
IDs or masking pins or doing whatever
funny things that the community does I
love you guys so much you're amazing
so they actually made coffee like chips
work on previous generation boards and
so I guess this is just so I said that
at the beginning of the show but I'm
actually not sure that I agree with it
anymore doesn't really feel the same
yeah there's a bit of a difference in
the way that they handled it so AMD
still has
time to pull an Intel on this and lock
it down like manually lock it down which
is what Intel did but the stance that
AMD is taking here is not actually that
different where they're saying look
because we don't want to create
confusion be in the in the marketplace
we're just gonna say X 570 yes
everything else no that's it and that's
exactly what Intel did because there
were previous generation boards that
wouldn't work with it either because the
vrm design wasn't good enough for any
other number of reasons they said well
then nothing because our compatibility
matrix cannot be that complicated
because you gotta remember and this is a
little funky you would kind of expect
top the line rog boards to support it in
the fact that they don't is weird and
kind of confusing yeah the fact that the
lower end ones the fact that the like
tough and prime boards do is like okay
so by keeping the message simple hey the
new gen works the old one doesn't you
avoid ticking off the customer who just
spent $400 on a crosshair whatever and
now has less functionality today than
the B 450 guy then the B 450 guy that
saved a buck last time which like I mean
that's great and it's cool that they
have support but I totally understand
why this would be confusing and it's
like the inverse of what you'd expect
and keeping the messaging clean can be
the best bet a lot of the time because I
mean a perfect example of this is
giveaways you guys might have noticed we
don't do a lot of giveaways on our
channel the reason for that is that for
every one person that you make happy you
piss off 10,000 oh yeah and so for
someone like an intel or an AMD for
every one enthusiast that they make
happy by enabling this feature and
obtain was another one where it could
have been back ported to older
generation boards but they didn't
because they didn't want to make it
confusing for every enthusiast that you
please out of the last generation you
are going to create a bunch of confusion
with normies who don't understand why
their stuff doesn't work so I get it but
I also think AMD so far has been better
about this in that they are at least
allowing it to work rather than
nealy locking it off yeah so something
interesting have you talked about like
enabling things can sometimes to be bad
doing giveaways sometimes to be bad
interesting random little tidbit we
added casting to the app but it was in a
known somewhat buggy state but it would
probably work for a lot of people and
we're like oh we can release this
version it says that it's an alpha every
single time we release a new version of
the app there's a big pop up talking
about everything and we say specifically
in their casting might be buggy average
ratings for the app went down when we
added casting as a feature because
people were like hey casting doesn't
work BAM
get rekt instead of people going like oh
five star it'll be cool with more
features come now they're going like
feature got here didn't fully work even
though you said it might not get rekt
and it's like it's interesting I'm not
complaining it's just an interesting
observation yeah that sometimes giving
people something is not actually great
because if it doesn't work properly or
announced or if someone else doesn't get
it or whatever it's gonna create
animosity and that makes sense it was
just it was a really interesting
observation so you can the app I'm gonna
throw this in here really quick iOS app
is like very much on the way it just
takes so much longer to do anything in
relation to Apple than it does with
Google holy crap our app has to be
manually reviewed by like a person and I
have to like give them a write up
explaining the app and how it works and
all this kind of stuff that they have to
read before it can be test flighted for
like not even actual release and then we
have to do that and then we're gonna
have to actually release it at which
point I believe it has to be manually
reviewed again but I'm not certain on
that and it's gonna take like a few
business days to get manually reviewed
so it's coming I don't know exactly win
cuz it's kind of in their court but it's
all in the way yeah all right play some
video games yes do it
alright so foods here yeah yeah all
right so right into the lounge
goodnight ladies and gentlemen see you
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
bye hey wait you're going to do
something next week should people be
like look
for you there I'll be I am Chicago yeah
yeah so Luke's gonna be there Intel
sponsoring you yeah if I recall
correctly so I don't I think I'm
building a computer or something cool so
guys check him out he's gonna be at I am
in Chicago don't miss it if you're gonna
I am in Chicago yeah otherwise I'm not
gonna say like get on a flight to see
this guy because if you're gonna do that
come to LTS yeah I was literally just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
