lying around and not sure about the
proper way to dispose of them here's
your first hint as much as you may or
may not have enjoyed that silly little
bit that we did there that was not it
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup check out the link in
the video description to learn more now
it's no great secret that to reduce your
consumption or reuse that which has
already been consumed is better in terms
of ecological impact than recycling it
but sometimes it happens that you might
have an unfortunate run of bad luck that
causes oh I don't know three
motherboards in a row to spontaneously
die through no fault of your own or
here's another scenario you've got
devices that technically still work but
have come to the point where absolutely
no one not even your weird uncle who
keeps milk crates of electronics in his
garage is willing to use them so the
first question I usually get is why
can't I just put my old CRT TV or
motherboard or harddrive in the garbage
and the answer is that while you
actually technically can because most
garbage collection services frankly
don't have the time or willingness to
dig through your trash bin to see what
you put in there there are a lot of good
reasons why you shouldn't number one is
that it keeps chemicals and heavy metals
managed correctly a waste can contain
mercury lead cadmium arsenic lithium and
a wide variety of other harmful or
dangerous substances number two is that
precious material such as aluminum from
casings copper from wiring or even gold
from contact points can be recovered
through the disassembly of old
electronics this lessens the need for
harvesting new raw materials from the
finite supply of resources that is our
planet Earth and number three even if
you're not a tree hugger or whatever
this should matter to you if you're a
taxpayer is that it keeps these items
out of landfills which means landfill
space is conserved lowering the cost of
your local waste disposal services and
in the long term even the costs
associated with things like increased
water filtration if any of these metal
and up in the water supply so then okay
that sounds great Linus why aren't
people doing this then great question
and the answer is pretty simple it's
time-consuming and tedious work to
safely disassemble these products to the
point where they can be reused in place
of raw materials which means it's
actually quite expensive to do so here
in BC Canada we have what's called an
environmental handling fee that gets
charged on items that can be returned
for free recycling and while there's
plenty of debate to be had about a
mandatory fee at the time of purchase on
all items I'll leave that to the
philosophers but is quite possible your
region has a similar program that you
can take advantage of and even if it
doesn't you may discover some random and
unexpected ways to dispose of this stuff
as well
bottle Depot's for example in my area
are the returned point for most a waste
and IKEA of all places has their own
in-store drop-off for household battery
and light bulb recycling go figure
and if your area doesn't have anything
like this there are services like think
recycle comm that do charge for the
items that they can't get any value out
of but can actually pay a bounty for
some other items and they'll do things
like refurbish toner cartridges and
they'll accept and even pay by the pound
for phones iPads and laptops even if
they're completely non-functional all
you have to do is put at least fifteen
items in a box and ship it off to them
if you have enough of the acceptable
items versus complete junk they're even
willing to provide you with a free
shipping label but wait if this video
has inspired you to run out and
responsibly dispose of your electronic
waste there are a couple of things you
should do first number one see if it
still works hey we've got a local
program called free geek that is willing
to take a lot of old computer and
electronic stuff and distribute it to
people and organizations that need it
like I said at the beginning reuse is
better than recycling and number two
while you're at it thoroughly wipe any
personal data off of your devices before
or recycling them while most people
don't even want to see that selfie sex
tape you made that night after
graduation or whatever anyone who does
want to see it you probably don't want
them seeing it so do your due diligence
and on the subject of digital security
it's fairly common knowledge among the
tech savvy that even in a perfect world
text-based passwords without additional
authentication factors are just not very
secure and there are a lot of companies
out there trying a lot of different
things to improve this which leads us to
today's episode sponsor true key by
Intel security
it's a password manager that removes the
hassle of passwords across all of your
devices computers phones and tablets
with support for Windows with chrome and
ie support iOS and Android you can log
into apps and websites with your face
fingerprint or by swiping a notification
on your personal smartphone and it
always knows that you're you with
multi-factor authentication only a
combination of being on a trusted device
passing facial recognition and/or
swiping a notification on your
smartphone can unlock your passwords and
you can add extra factors to pass words
you'd like to really lock down or fewer
for websites that you'd like to access
faster and that don't hold any valuable
information your true key account syncs
across all of your devices so be sure to
download it to your phones tablets and
computers you can find a link for where
to try it out in the video description
