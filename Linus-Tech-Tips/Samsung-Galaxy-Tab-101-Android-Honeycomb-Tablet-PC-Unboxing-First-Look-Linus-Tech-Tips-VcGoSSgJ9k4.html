Android side of things what I would
consider to be the closest equivalent to
something like an iPad 2 in terms of the
form factor the sleekness of the design
and in terms of the well really the the
look the style okay so the Galaxy Tab
10.1 here we go so it's obviously a 10.1
inch screen it's a 1280 by 800
resolution which is pretty much par for
the course 16 by 9 aspect ratio it does
use the NVIDIA Tegra 2 chip which means
that you do have support for games that
require Tegra to the something that says
dual-core processor 1 gigahertz x 2 but
it also has a fairly powerful GPU on
there as well so that's a good thing to
note ok it uses a pls display so just in
case you were wondering what kind of
display type it uses the Osoyoos is an
IPS panel this uses a pls panel we've
got Intel Adobe Flash Player we've got
HD video capture and playback so it does
include a 3.2 megapixel front camera a 2
megapixel back camera in terms of their
photo taking capabilities and claims
that you can capture HD video does
support video chat and it has a seven
thousand milliamp hour battery although
that doesn't tell us anything about the
battery life itself
I wouldn't expect battery life to be
quite as strong a point for this one as
some of the bigger tablets because and
this is important to note the Tab 10.1
is actually the thinnest tablet on the
market by a whopping 0.2 of a millimeter
compared to the iPad 2 so here we go
there's the tab itself let's put that
aside for now and let's see what Samsung
includes here do you want to just go
back where you work there we go so
Samsung has what is this is this on you
looks like a manual
okay all right then maybe this manual
wasn't meant to be read there we go
finally got it open all right so the
manuals of information okay that sounds
fun go you tab health health and safety
and warranty guide okay why don't we
find out what the warranty is I'm just
curious
probably a one-year warranty that's
pretty standard these days page 40 for
one year there you go cases 90 days
tablet one year batteries one year cool
okay next we have sign up now this
customized your Samsung phone experience
okay next we have what looks like
probably a QuickStart guide so shows you
where all the buttons are shows you have
the basic functionality how to charge it
you're gonna have to charge it using the
included adaptor because like many
tablets it does require more power than
can be provided out of a standard USB
port although some motherboards do
include features that allow you to
charge tablets and higher draw devices
out of some USB ports so keep an eye out
for that if you do have a tablet and
you're upgrading your motherboard that's
a pretty neat little feature it includes
a pair of headphones which have not only
headphones on them but also here left
right there we go also a microphone as
well as a single button so you can
actually press it once to play or pause
or twice to skip a track so that's kind
of a neat little function to build in as
well and finally we have a charging
cable charging slash dock cable so this
plugs into the bottom of the unit yes
plugs into the bottom of the unit right
here and then plugs into a charger or
your PC alright so now it's finally time
to have a look at the unit itself and in
terms of the overall slickness of it it
feels really nice to hold its you know
what I don't I don't want to I don't
want to say it cuz I'm not sure but it
feels lighter than most of the other
tablets that I played with remember
though a lot of how something feels is
actually the ergonomics more than the
weight so don't quote me on that because
I haven't
the particular unit but it feels really
really lightweight to hold on to for
some reason all right so on the front
here actually what I wanted to turn it
on really quick here is our power /
standby button right up here on the side
you can see that this guy is very very
slim you know I'm gonna pull out an iPad
2 for comparison give me a sec here guys
so there you go there's the point two
millimeter difference in thickness now
one of the other things that is going to
be far more comfortable about the tab is
the fact that it is later I can tell
almost a hundred percent the Tab 10.1
feels lighter than the iPad 2 which is
great because a lot of the time you're
not necessarily sitting at a desk with a
tablet in front of you watching it you
might be sitting on a plane holding it
you might be laying in bed holding it
like this whatever the case may be
having a lighter tablet is definitely
going to make for a better overall
experience now one of the other things
that really stands up to me about the
Tab 10.1 is the construction quality it
feels like it's worth the $4.99 price
tag which cannot necessarily be said
about every tablet that's in that price
range so even though it does have a
plastic back this is a very smart design
for a couple of reasons so number one
one of my biggest complaints about the
iPad 2 in terms of the build quality
outstanding it just feels great it does
it's true you can like it or lump it but
it's true ok but this aluminum back
every time I put it down I feel like I'm
breaking it you know I feel like I'm
damaging it which is kind of stressful I
mean yeah you can probably get like
covers for it but that defeats the
purpose of having a super-slim tablet
don't you think you go and wrap it in
like a big old case well why right do
you want something that covers the
screen on the front and the back should
be pretty much should take care of
itself so the Samsung Tab 10.1 has a
plastic back and it has a texture to it
so what that means is I can take it and
I can go like this and I don't feel
uncomfortable about that because even if
it gets a small scratch on it that's not
going to be very noticeable at all this
is the 16 gig version I have here today
but it's also available in 32 gigs and
let's cover a couple basic specs here
before I get into the locations of all
the
different things on the tab 10.1 of
which there are a few so we've got a
headphone jack here which you can
obviously use with the included
headphones and microphone right there
okay just like that and that also has
that media control functionality that I
talked about before we do have a
front-mounted oh I already talked about
the the cameras at night but you've also
got a flash on the tab 10.1 that is a
very handy feature I actually do use the
flash from time to time on my iPhone 4
and the reason is because if I'm trying
to find my way in the dark I'll just
turn on actually this is a really cool
little app I have a little flashlight
app just turn that on and I can find my
way around right so that's kind of neat
so having something like that is a cool
feature even if you don't use it for
photographs okay up at the top here
you've got the power slash standby
button you've also got a volume rocker
so that's down that's up you've got that
guy on the side you find a speaker port
on the bottom you've got your dock as
well as what appears to be a microphone
port although I have not 100% sure about
that that looks like a microphone port
and then on the other side of speaker so
what you don't have on the 10.1 and I'm
gonna assume that this is partly due to
the very very slim very slick form
factor is things like HDMI out okay that
is not supported on the tab 10.1 we also
don't see any support for a micro SD or
an SD card slot so these are compromises
that you are going to have to make in
terms of elegance and since I would only
consider the iPad to really equivalent
to the Tab 10.1 in terms of its form
factor then it doesn't have any check
boxes against it in terms of this
competition because the iPad 2 also
doesn't support external video app and
also doesn't support external added
storage now you can get a keyboard dock
but right now it's only available from
Samsung so you know I wouldn't listen
it's not like the transformer where the
keyboard dock is pretty much a
brain-dead add-on to it because it comes
with the included battery pack and the
extra functionality like the USB ports
but if you did want a keyboard you could
get that although really I'd reckon
just grabbing a Bluetooth keyboard and
pairing it to your Galaxy Tab because
what I've found in my experience I've
actually got a keyboard for the iPad 2 I
never use it I I very very rarely
actually do any serious email use on a
tablet so I'm mostly focused on things
like web browsing YouTube where you're
just typing a couple little things and
the keyboard is included with Android
the on-screen keyboards as well as iOS
are more than sufficient for that kind
of thing so this pretty much wraps up my
unboxing of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from one
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos actually one more thing it is
available in a couple of different
colors I went with the darker color
because I do believe it'll be a little
bit more resistant to grunge buildup and
for something as elegant and slick
looking as this you want to kind of look
elegant and slick six months down the
road so that is why I did decide to go
that route</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
