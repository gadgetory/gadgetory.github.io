the type of people who believe
everything you read on the internet
because whenever I've ranted usually
frothing at the mouth about what a
terrible connector USB micro-b is I have
gotten a lot of pushback from the
community defending it
you guys point out words you've read
like that it's rated to ten thousand
insertions and extractions which is five
thousand more than any of the USB mini
ports that preceded it and that it was
specifically redesigned to wear out the
cable rather than the device so your
fancy thousand dollar smartphone doesn't
turn into a fancy thousand dollar
paperweight but may I think that micro-b
especially the USB free variant that
showed up briefly on Samsung phones
isn't that durable I think this whole
thing is a lie propagated by big USB I
think in the real world micro B breaks
before it's been inserted ten thousand
times and I I'm gonna blow this thing
wide open
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel they're the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description
much like the prenatal development of my
children this video has been nine months
in the making
let's just hope it turns out a little
better so in order to conduct my tests I
asked Samsung to send me their older
portable SSD t1 to which they said no
start well first they said yeah sure no
problem then they said oh sorry we can't
do that so I actually had to buy one of
these and it wasn't that hard to find a
brand new one but I did brand new sealed
this is basically a similar idea but it
uses a USB 3 micro B connector then
because micro B is actually designed to
wear out the cable first rather than the
connector on the device I wanted to make
sure that in fairness I was sourcing two
brand new cables so I've got a brand new
micro B cable and a brand new type C
cable the methodology here is I'm going
to take these two SSDs this one is
brand-new never used to by the way I'm
going to unplug and plug back in let's
say you know fifty to a hundred times at
a time and then I'm going to check them
again
and see if they work until one of them
dies so that's how it all started in
August 2016 I set out on the expedition
of a lifetime I began with sets of 50
insertions making entries in my journal
between each set by the first 100
insertions both connectors had lost
their like new stiffness by 250 even
ignoring the orientation agnosticism USB
sees more forgiving positioning and
lower mating force we're making the
repetitions much faster and by 500 micro
B was actually the one that felt closer
to its original state with Type C being
looser
but neither connector was showing any
signs of giving up the ghost and I have
to say the tedium of the journey
B
again to take its toll but I persevered
until a thousand insertions by this
stage USB sees noticeably looser feel
made it a welcome break from the micro B
connector that seems to be grabbing more
stickily than ever before
and I began to think that maybe my bad
experiences with it had less to do with
raw cycle durability and more to do with
every day we're like sitting plugged in
for an extended period or getting
wiggled back and forth while being moved
around so with that in mind and totally
not because I just got busy and forgot
the devices sat connected but untouched
for six long hard throbbing months but
then we hired someone who isn't me
to pick up the torch and insert like
he'd never inserted before James still
took another three months to get to the
Big Finish but he gets full marks for
creativity he used the Yahtzee grip the
double hander and the ol pulling a
carrot out of the ground technique
logging his observations along the way
as well so by 2500 insertions micro B
actually needed a little coaxing to get
it in there by 3200 it had actually
learned to loosen up and relax for a
less friction full experience by 4500
type C's tight fit had noticeably
loosened while micro B had reached a
state of downright slipperiness by 6,000
insertions we made the observations that
B was more difficult to insert than C
but seemed to be more engaged during the
experience and that the man hours were
beginning to make this one of the most
expensive videos we had ever made with
no end in sight a 10,000 insertion
rating theoretically means at least
10,000 I mean it can go to 50,000 for
all we know
James begged me to allow him to build a
machine to do this for him but I bravely
told him no because that would remove
the imperfect human element of our test
so his journey continued unabated until
one day long after all hope for Humanity
had drained from his heart James
inserted the micro B for the 8,000th
time and nothing happened the machine
didn't recognize the device anymore
so then after eight thousand insertions
the USB type-c drive is working
perfectly with a connection field that I
would actually go as far as to still
trust but the micro B is toast at only
80% of what it was theoretically rated
for and we tried a brand new cable to
see if per the spec it was actually the
cable that died first the cable is
mangled but still works leading us to
the conclusion then this is a sample
size of one so apart from knowing the
approximate number of insertions
somewhere between seventy nine hundred
and eight thousand that it lasted before
breaking it's really not any more
meaningful than someone else's anecdotal
evidence that their connector failed
we haven't demonstrated conclusively
that micro B is overrated but I feel
like what we have added some strength to
is that on top of its reversibility
extra pins for added functionality and
yes excellent durability Type C is truly
a worthy replacement ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction I know
it's crazy but for real you call them
and you talk directly to a person and
the bills are even cheap you only pay
for the data and voice service that you
actually use with the average ting bill
coming in at about 23 dollars a month
per device they'll even cover 25% of
your cancellation fee if you're stuck in
a contract and they have
or mobile data rates than ever at just
$10 a gig beyond the first gigabyte
every single tin customer will get to
reap the benefits of this new change
even existing once and if all this
sounds too good to be true well you can
validate it for yourself head over to
Linus ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator enter your last few bills and
how much you're paying and it'll tell
you if ting will save you money and if
you sign up at our link you'll also get
25 bucks in service credit or towards a
new device so thanks to Samsung for
providing at least one of the drives we
used for our testing actually the
surviving one the other one we had to
buy thanks to you guys for watching if
you dislike this video you know what to
do but if you liked it hit that like
button get subscribed maybe check out
where to buy the stuff we featured this
is Samsung's portable SSD t3 at the link
