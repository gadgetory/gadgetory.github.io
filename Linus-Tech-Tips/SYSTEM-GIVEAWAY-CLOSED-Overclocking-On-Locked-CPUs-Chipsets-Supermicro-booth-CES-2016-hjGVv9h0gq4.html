to CES 2016 this year check out their
link in the video description down below
alright guys before we get into the
giveaway which I know you guys are
probably a little antsy for I got to
talk about the supermicro H 170 this
board is pretty crazy because it allows
overclocking on non overclockable CPUs
the non k-series CPUs and it's using an
H series chipset which is a non
overclocking chipset but you can
overclock that lands its price kind of
somewhere between what you would expect
from a standard H 170 and a standard Z
170 board they accomplished this
overclock ability in layman's terms by
having a custom bios with some nice
little algorithms in there and by having
an external clock generator outside of
the CPUs platform this allows them to
completely bypass Intel's currently
locked overclocking clock speed
generator and have their own this
requires some upgrades to what you would
normally see on an H 170 board you need
an expanded vrm you need expanded
cooling you need that kind of stuff but
that's where the cost is not in the
chipset but you get the same
capabilities pretty damn cool for
example they have an i3 6100 te here
which normally runs at 2.7 gigahertz
it's a two core for thread processor and
they have it overclocked to 4.1 which is
pretty ridiculous not really a thing
we're used to and very very very cool
and then finally on the back for i/o you
have two USB 2.0 ps2 DVI hdmi
displayport optical for USB 3.0 gigabit
ethernet and a bank of 3.5 millimeter
audio connectors finally to the giveaway
details we got some more to talk about
after that but first I need you guys to
like subscribe do that then go down
below and comment let me know what you
think about overclocking on a non k cpu
and an h series chipset if you win that
will get you this whole system that's 16
gigabytes of predator ddr4 a 256
gigabyte fury SSD from hyperx a PNY
reference 980 TI at 750 watt seasonic
power supply the i3 6100 te that we
mentioned earlier which does come pre
overclocked to 4.1 gigahertz just in
case you're worried about doing that on
your own
and obviously the supermicro H 170 and
super micro s5 special edition as well
also if you didn't notice it comes with
the nice little add-ons like the custom
red extensions leavings and the red LEDs
that go around the case and last but not
least we have the c7 Z 170 oce this is a
green stylized motherboard which is
actually super cool because it's not a
ton of people that are doing that right
now this also features the overclock
ability for non k-series CPUs that the
previous motherboard does but this is a
Zed 170 chipset so if you have say a
6700 you would be able to overclock it
unlike normal where you'd have to
overclock on a 6700 k you may be able to
save some money that way pretty cool in
terms of i/o this one has a ps2 port two
USB 2.0 ports optical hdmi displayport
DVI two USB 3.0 s a USB type-c gen2
connector two gigabit connectors and a
bank of 3.5 millimeter audio jacks thank
you guys for watching stay subscribed
linus tech to see all the rest of our
CES content and make you to Squarespace
for bringing us here this year if you
need to make a website for whatever i'm
honestly running out of ideas for these
so if you want to make a website about
ideas about why you would make a website
you could do that with squarespace using
their template engine and you could sell
your ideas with their commerce module so
there i guess i'm still not out of ideas
just quite yet if you're having troubles
with that they have 24 7 live chat
support and email support and if you buy
a year of Squarespace you get a domain
for free Squarespace build it beautiful
thanks for watching we'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
