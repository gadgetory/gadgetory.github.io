computer on the wall well I could say it
helps with cable management or that it
helps with cooling or that you know what
forget it
there's only one good reason because it
looks bull now your garden-variety wall
pewter is a rectangle shaped but here at
LTT we are all about pushing the limits
of college dropout engineering so our
residents love proposed that we make
ours in the shape of the land show logo
with hard line tubing spelling out LTT
however since he's barely touched power
tools let alone built a fully custom
wall case before we well essentially we
needed an adult so we cast for Imperial
small globally which didn't work
obviously so we packed up our set and
drove down to their shop in Seattle
instead
since the machines frame would be built
in VF mods is top-secret facility in
Washington State before final assembly
we needed to ensure that all the
dimensions were relayed correctly we
started with a to scale 3d model of the
machine using Sketchup and the built-in
objects library
they took our model added a few
suggestions made an offhand comment
about amateurs then rebuilt it from the
ground up to account for their CNC
machines capabilities once that stage
was complete we loaded our pre tested
hardware into the company SUV and sent
Ivan and Teller down south at the border
crossing I'm sorry you're doing what
with all this expensive looking
electronic crap well the guard ended up
disappearing for what felt like forever
and then came back saying he watched
some of our videos as proof that we were
who we said we were hopefully he
subscribed and we were on our way then
while in the middle of zero cell
reception know where our shifter broke
forcing us to abandon the van at a local
shop Ivan got hit on by a middle-aged
passerby on the side of the road and our
trailer got carted away by an
overzealous view hall employee laughs
half full though these delays only cost
us a day and nothing actually fell out
of the rental truck that one time
time to build first things first we had
to get the most important stuff done and
peel the RAM then we laid out the key
components to check if the real world
would align perfectly or if some of our
holes would need to be wood threaded 630
to insert screws coupled with standard
standoffs were used to mount our
motherboard on to the frame with
radiator inlets elongated with
female-to-female extenders to reach
through the board our graphics card slot
dimensions were a little off so rod
engaged the safety squints and extended
it with a router next we removed four of
the backplate screws from our hybrid
cooled Asus Poseidon GTX 1080p I replace
them with two millimeter
threaded standoffs and use the highly
advanced color the tips with white pen
technique to mark our drill holes before
mounting then we use the total of 1.3
meters of thermaltake PCI Express
extenders to connect our graphics card
now it's a sense if expect that you
cannot achieve maximum performance
without Mucha RGB so to that end we yet
again term to thermaltake for both their
RGB water cooling fittings and ring plus
fans even going as far as to replace our
stock power supply fan with an RGB one
course their power supply plus
Thermaltake fans equals Corsair take
thermal fare whatever it is it didn't
survive the procedure so Ivan had to mod
our backup one and Chiz allows the
through-hole by hand looks like he's had
some practice with that movement then we
was done to keep whole and beginning to
a minimum every single fan and RGB
fitting got deep end using two pairs of
tweezers of all things because someone
didn't have a proper deepening tool rod
so with the slab occupied rod fired up
his parts Pro 4896 CNC router apparatus
and cut out the back panel for the frame
this piece is important for both
mounting to the wall and providing
structural rigidity to the front once
deepening was done through holes were
drilled to route the cables and pump and
res fittings through and then the whole
shebang had to be repin on the other
side shockingly though all the fans and
fittings lit up on the first go of
course the machine had to be shamelessly
branded so we added a cnc'd
semi-transparent hexagons that would
later be lit with side firing LEDs then
came a challenge rod can freehand been
hard line tubing nor prepares but with
our goal of having the bends for the
tees run parallel the
mission was made to design and CNC out
custom jigs while these were being
manufactured
I've been finished wiring up the
backside and then ran soft tubing along
the back to all the ports to minimize
the use of elbows to improve water flow
unfortunately our first attempts didn't
quite line up it took the CAD guy some
time to figure out the issue and because
of the delays during the inbound trip
our time at the shop ran out while we
were discovering that pulling the
silicone inserts out of our 3d bent
tubes was going to be a two-man job so
the machine was picked up and loaded
into the van as is to be finished in our
shop our tubing and paint both needed
some improvement but hey we had a whole
day and a half left until it would need
to make its debut at LT X what could go
wrong guys well I'm glad you asked the
backstop on the Poseidon could have been
not tightened fully and spring a leak
flooding the card power supply and the
paint job and speaking of the paint job
the dust in our warehouse could settle
on the frame within hours making matters
much worse but an isopropyl bath and
some touch-ups later and the Machine
ultimately made it to the event where it
was gloriously displayed above the dick
pot application area mission
accomplished
most guys this isn't funny guys so here
it is in all its glory we settled
eventually on an Intel Core i7 7700 K on
an ASUS Maximus 9 code with 64 gigs of
corsair dominator Platinum special
edition memory to accompany our asu's
rog poseidon GT X 1080 Ti cooling was
courtesy of ek water blocks those guys
do gam fine work and thermal take there
were certainly some hiccups but
hopefully it was all in the name of your
entertainment and were proud of the
results so much so that we're actually
planning to keep it
display in our vr gaming room here at
the office which was actually why we
chose the 7700 K so thanks for watching
