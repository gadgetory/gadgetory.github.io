normal components we could stick to the
convenient list of known compatible
parts and we could stay safely within
the boundaries of modern technology we
could do reviews of stuff like smart
baby monitors and stack Chua okay what
we do have on that note we do have a
video coming about the MIMO smart baby
monitor so make sure you're subscribed
so you don't miss that but that's not
what we normally do no today we're going
to be building a 48 terabyte storage
server with 64 gigs of RAM eight
processing cores an 80 plus gold power
supply and ample cooling all in a case
that's not much bigger than a couple of
shoeboxes welcome to insane compact Nazz
2014 corsair gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision cherry onyx RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more so I was first inspired to do
this build when silverstone showed me
the ds3
80 a case that they boasted featured
support for an ITX motherboard eight
three and a half inch hard drives and
for two and a half inch SSDs or hard
drives to which I replied well ok but
what the heck hardware are you expecting
people to put in this thing storage
geeks on a budget are going to buy
twelve or sixteen portrayed cards and
put them in an ITX machine are you mad
and they said no no no no there's a
perfect motherboard for this thing the
asrock raksi 2750 d4 i server slash
workstation board with a passively
cooled until avataan 2758 core cpu
support for up to 64 gigs of ECC ddr3
memory dual intel i 210 network cards 12
SATA ports 6 8:03 from a pair of
marbella controllers and six from the
intel controller two of which are state
of three and the other four of which are
SATA to a PCIe 8x expansion slot that
you can use for raid
our expansion or in our case a 10
gigabit NIC card and some really sweet
server grade remote monitoring and
management stuff that I've never really
had the pleasure of playing around with
before including power controls and even
a display output preview that runs in a
little Java plugin in your browser so I
said heck yeah man now this board is
cool in general but it's most important
feature for this build was actually kind
of hidden in that massive spec list and
it wasn't hard drive support but rather
RAM support we're going to be using
freenas which calls for some base memory
about eight gigs and then one gig of ECC
so that's error correcting ram per one
terabyte of raw storage space so given
that we're planning to use 8 6 terabyte
three and a half inch drives in ZFS -
it's about equivalent to raid 6 and that
two drives within a Vita can fail out
right before any data is lost but
otherwise not necessarily that similar
well we're going to need a whole lot of
RAM aren't we 64 gigs is possibly
slightly overkill but since the options
are going to be 32 gigs in you know a
regular four dimm motherboard or
doubling it to 64 gigs in this
particular motherboard well we're better
off going a little bit overkill rather
than risking losing data because we
didn't have enough RAM so we've got four
sticks of intelligent memories 16 gig
dims that we're going to be using to
keep our data nice and safe there right
on the approved hardware list for this
motherboard so feeling pretty good about
our chances which leads us to the
storage drives we're using just about
the bad assets storage drives on the
market right now see gates enterprise
capacity drives they're designed for use
in large storage appliances and the most
demanding possible environments data
centers where vibration from nearby
drives all around them needs to be
compensated for and performance cannot
go down and failure is not an option and
I mean not only do these bad boys come
prepared for a 24/7 or always-on
workload with full Drive Encryption
support and a huge 1.4 million our mean
time between failure but compared to
sigue
zone consumer Nass drives their ratings
are based on ten times the workload or
550 terabytes per year with a five-year
warranty to back it up sug
feeling pretty good about these two but
obviously these drives what we're using
as a small business isn't necessarily
going to be practical for everyone
and these enterprise capacity drives
might not make any sense for the typical
home user but for you guys there's the
regular Nass Andrade drives that are
perfectly good options for a one to
eight day storage device and cool little
tidbit but I wasn't actually aware of is
the Seagate sells them with a data
recovery insurance plan now that they're
calling Seagate plus rescue that
includes shipping both ways a
replacement drive that they send the
data back to you on and no deductible or
limit to the cost of the recovery
service what about a 90% success rate so
that's maybe something to consider I had
no idea that was there until I was
researching this build now for the rest
of the hardware I had originally
intended to install the eight three and
a half inch drives from mass storage
with four SSDs for operating system and
a large SSD cache but further
investigation revealed that unless
you're free Nass is going to be used for
a database workload or like a mail
server you may not benefit from an l2
arc or SSD cache at all and even if you
would benefit you want to keep the size
relatively small like 128 gigs or 256
gigs in those cases so I decided to
change gears and use my one terabyte
SSDs for dedicated shares that can be
assigned to individual video editors to
use as high speed storage for scratch
disks this server will have up to a
twenty gigabit per second link to the
rest of the network so it should be
enough to keep everyone's storage snappy
even if they're accessing SSD storage
over their own ten gigabit links then
for power I've gone with a silverstone s
FX 450 watt module or any plus gold
power supply so this is actually the
first time I've ever been thankful that
a power supply has a removable eight pin
CPU connector since this board doesn't
require one and there's not a lot of
space for cable management in this case
so the set up process for freeness once
you read the highly recommended by the
'we 60-plus page PDF written by cyber
jack from the free NOS forms is actually
surprisingly straightforward burn a disk
and put it in the system with only the
drive that you want to use for your LS
installed in my case an old 80 gig intel
X 25 M gen one and the whole thing
pretty much does itself once you boot it
up shut er down to install all your
drives or don't the ass rock board has
full support for hot swap and then you
pretty much boot up and you're dumped at
a command prompt where actually things
for surprisingly straightforward it
might look a little bit intimidating if
you've never really dealt with that kind
of thing before but it's it's really not
you're just going to select which
Ethernet interface you're going to check
the IP address that was assigned to the
system via DHCP from your router and
then you're going to go to some other
computer on the network enter that IP
create a password and that's pretty much
it you can do the rest of it if you're
not getting into the more advanced
features of freenas through the web
interface so then Linus why FreeNAS with
a ZFS filesystem for this build great
question um initially I just kind of
wanted to try it since I've never played
around with it before and I heard it was
great and I thought I might be able to
save some money since the three mixed
controller setup on this ass rock board
will not support a large raid array
across all the different controllers and
I'd need an add in hardware RAID card
which would add expense and limit me to
the onboard gigabit networking ports in
teaming mode well after doing the
necessary research I discovered that due
to the ludicrous RAM requirements both
in terms of the amount you have to buy
and the necessity of ECC support you
won't really be saving any money if you
want a really high capacity server like
ours anyway and I discovered that
FreeNAS is surprisingly limited in terms
of how you can expand your arrays and
whatnot but I decided to go ahead with
it anyway just so that I could try it
and so that I could salvage my lightning
fast networking something that will be
important if we have multiple editors
working with 4k ProRes footage off the
same array at the same time where lots
of sequential performance is going to be
key so at the end of all that how did it
perform then well here you go these
numbers are
for a 10 gaben SSD based workstation to
our server so while it wasn't cheap
there's no doubt that when it comes to
what we were after which was sequential
performance for multiple users we ended
up with a pretty rockin and compact
little storage box here speaking of
multiple users team.com
mobile that makes sense that's their
tagline and unlike most smaller carriers
because you might be sitting there going
well I've never heard of ting before
they probably have like a like cell
towers made of like you know pretzels
and paper clips and like clothes hangers
no no it's not like that they're
actually running on the Sprint network
but the key difference so as long as you
have good sprint service in your area
then you'll get good ting service the
key difference is that they're buying
wholesale from Sprint and then they give
you guys a very very different sort of
deal so you're not locked into any sort
of a contract you pay only for what you
use their average monthly bill per
device is only $21 and what's cool about
it is you can kind of go oh well yeah
but the way that I use my phone you know
my locked-in plan where I get a thousand
text messages in this many minutes and
this many megabytes of data it works
perfectly for me every month I use
exactly that amount we'll go ahead and
test it because they have a savings
calculator that lets you plug in all the
numbers from your last three bills so
how much you paid how much airtime you
use and all that stuff and then it just
runs a little calculation goes Bing you
would have saved this much on ting or
hey maybe you wouldn't've it just runs
the calculation for you so they think
you're 98 percent of Americans would
save so it's probably worth it to check
it out and if you do use our link Linus
ENCOM to get $25 off a new device or $25
in service credit pretty cool stuff so
thank you for watching this video you
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment letting me know what you would
have changed about the insane compact
Nazz here I'm actually genuinely very
curious you know what you guys would do
for an ass cuz you know there's a lot of
variation and as always check the link
in the video description you can buy a
cool t-shirt like this one you can give
us a monthly contribution or you can
change your Amazon
marked one with our affiliate code so
whenever you buy hard drives we get a
small kickback all that stuff helps us
out a lot thanks again for watching and
