to the Wynn show we've got a fantastic
show planned out for you today at least
I think we do I wouldn't know I had
nothing to do with the planning right
hooray but in all seriousness we've got
a couple of guests one of whom is
another creator that we have actually
never collaborated with before so that's
pretty exciting
and the second is someone whose final
day here at Linus Media Group is today
we are doing oh yeah I guess you
probably didn't know about that we are
doing a I don't know they were coming on
yeah yeah we are doing a farewell
farewell stream for for one of our one
of our staffers who's been here over a
year now actually Laos amazing how time
flies yeah so we got a bunch of great
topics lined up for you including
Intel's ten nanometer delay Intel is I
mean it's like the first time in how
many decades that Intel hasn't been at
the bleeding edge of process no tech
it's gonna be really interesting because
they might be in trouble um
abital Apple to move touch digitizer and
what does that even mean
that called cuff oh oh oh apples
ditching 3d touch wah-wah-wah Jim Keller
joins Intel this is big news if you
don't know who Jim Keller is basically
he's like CPU design like hey Zeus I
went with hey SUSE to make it like not
sort of offensive did it help at all no
okay well so we got Windows 10 redstone
five gets telephony api's hinting at a
surface phone which I thought I thought
they learnt their lesson already on that
one but maybe you know second time take
your time give it give it give another
shot all right so speaking of giving it
another shot let's give another shot at
rolling this intro
Oh does it matter that I move to this
window is that a problem I have no idea
like are we using like screencap they
capture that I think from a different
thing though
okay I think it's okay so hopefully all
of that is fine I'm getting a bunch of
messages hopefully that's problem oh we
forgot to we forgot to do a tweet the
land show is live this video brought to
you by LTI and private engineers all
right so I gotta do a thing real quick
here like that thing and also this thing
but with Twitter like totally finds this
stuff so does YouTube so does Facebook
and they just super bury it yeah every
week will tweet the same thing right hey
our show is live and those platforms
will specifically go out of their way to
be SuperDuper sure that no one would
want to know that and what is going on
right now why are you calling yourself
how am i calling someone i it's not and
hangout crashed so hangouts is crashed
it's calling someone and somehow have
you seen me take my phone out of my
pocket
this phone not not the iPhone from my
back pocket no no
somehow it was awake so far I think this
is the the like smoothest start to a
Windows Phone incredible ghost phone
there's nothing I can do about these
kinds of things my fault can't be it's
also incredibly hot in here yeah Wow I
think you can see it like my face is
glistening that I don't think that's
like a lighting problem no me too I'm
sweating it's only April and it's
already getting to be like summer
weather here all right yeah so why don't
we jump into our first topic here and
why don't we just invite our guests
let me see if I can rip these out how to
do it and look on the thing click on the
thing other thing and wrong thing
hey look it's us hi so welcome to the
show Jason how are you doing ah
we are fantastic a little frazzled and a
little warm yeah but otherwise fantastic
how are you it's Friday uh TGIF
I know right as if it meant anything
wait you don't get the weekend off oh
yeah I know well you're you're not
exactly new to the YouTube game so there
shouldn't be much of a surprise to you
so uh yeah we've all we've we've already
got we've already got people being like
holy crap never new tech deals a name in
our twitch chat yeah Jason who's
actually a lot of that going on right
now so why don't you do a quick intro to
yourself or anyone who hasn't stumbled
across your videos over on the tube my
name is Jason I run a YouTube channel
called tech deals and I do basically
tech deals I do tech reviews and the
best deals and builds and all sorts of
fun stuff just just picture me as a much
smaller younger version of Linus like
five years ago Wow
I mean with all that with all the shade
that this guy was throwing even before
the show started I was worried we're
gonna have to bring in some more light
so you wouldn't even be able to see our
glistening forehead and he's keeping it
up so you can find this channel over
here five things to consider when buying
an SSD is the what do they call that a
channel trailer now whatever they call
that the featured video on your home so
giveaway in review eighty plus power
supply 1050 vs 1050 Ti 2018 update okay
why does that need to be updated because
people like that stuff because people
want to know how like the new games play
far cry 5 and stuff like that huh
um I used to do similar content to that
you're like what is that back in the
garage
I'm busy RG being Thanos RG being things
today if your brain was just a little
bit younger
it would have been malleable enough to
remember that now you what is this like
a tack lioness show kalanchoe
well you answered the question
artificial you answer the question of
where he could be found with a youtube
link instead of mentioning the new thing
ah yes so I totally screwed up and it's
it's totally my fault that especially
Luke is going after me you have a hero
fix it mind you oh okay just don't have
a thing right alright you can find in
there okay okay so this is this is
pretty cool so the thing that we're
announcing here is that Jason is going
to be the second non lioness Media Group
creator to show up on Flo please
my spective spit altra and write their
tech deals is now live on the platform
and obviously we've had a look at some
of the stuff you've got up on YouTube
but what do you have available now for
people to check out over on flip lane
we have got some early access videos
over there the May 2018 unboxing is
already there with more than a dozen
cool things unboxed there's some
additional testing of VRAM requirements
there's a couple of behind-the-scenes
videos that are exclusive to floatplane
just some interesting videos that you
just won't see on youtube so cool stuff
holy crap you've been really busy you've
only had access to the account for like
two days
that the gallic said that Galax is the
first time I've ever tested a galaxy
card
cool huh sheesh alright well that's
fantastic okay cool
alright so why don't we actually do
something that we rarely do on win show
here and actually get into a tech topic
oh wow
so the this was originally posted on the
Linus tech tips forum by Sam C and the
original article here is from Tom's
hardware but basically this this is
absolutely huge Intel's 10 nanometer
technology is and the headline says this
is pretty pretty savage here actually is
broken and apparently delayed until 2019
now if the rest of the industry were
going through the same challenges this
wouldn't even really be that newsworthy
except that the word on the street is
that AMD is already in the prototyping
stages using seven nanometer technology
from their partner global boundaries
yeah yeah yeah the and this isn't to add
a little bit to this isn't rumor mill
stuff I often complain like I don't like
rumors this was from a I believe a
shareholders call
yeah so during their quarterly earnings
call now this was yesterday Intel
basically was like yep this is a thing I
go and it's not too surprising they've
been like a lot of the news lately of
like oh this person has been hired for
Intel has been like them poaching from
other companies pretty aggressively so
it seems like they knew there was a
problem they've been trying to pull
people in to solve it I mean Jason do
you think they were trying to bury this
new somewhat under an extremely strong
quarter on earnings they were I mean
they had great earnings but they're
their desktop businesses flat it's their
services business that's up and it looks
like we're gonna be getting yet another
iteration of 14 nanometer beyond coffee
like believe it or not oh I mean this is
kind of does this feel really similar to
what started happening with GPUs right
around the 28 nanometer time yeah when
is the last time
AMD had the chance of having a CPU at a
smaller production process than Intel I
don't think I've been a computer
enthusiast long enough for AMD to have
even been on the same process note as
Intel and I don't mean where they like
Intel when it went ahead and then AMD
caught up and then until like I mean for
AMD to have like launched at around a
similar time with using the same
manufacturing processes Intel so just
for those of you who aren't familiar
with what this means there are a number
of things that make a CPU or GPU or any
kind of processor inherently better so
adding more cache for example adding
smarter cache that is as long as it's
not suffering from Specter or meltdown
related issues minor problems increasing
the clock speed all of these things help
so architectural changes to the design
of the chip and how its logic works
these help performance and can
potentially help efficiency but the kind
of freebie that for decades
we've pretty much taken for granted is
shrinking the manufacturing process so
the size of the transistors with a
couple of notable exceptions this
inherently makes the chips more power
efficient and smaller allowing you to
increase the complexity I mean that's
why a CPU today can have in excessive
like 20 megabytes of cash whereas back
when I was getting into this stuff
I mean having 256 kilobytes or 512
kilobytes was considered did he just
take jerky never mind you know having
256 kilobytes or 512 kilobytes was
considered pretty darn good so AMD by
manufacturing on a smaller process
inherently has an advantage in terms of
power consumption and chip complexity
that Intel has just taken for granted
for the last what 20 years yeah pretty
much it's given them their huge
advantage that's incredible so I mean
there's a couple other just sort of
housekeeping items here they're shipping
cannon Lake and low-volume haven't
pointed to specific customers or
products and basically they're multi
patterning processes generating too many
yield reducing defects to produce ten
nanometer cost-effectively so that's
another thing that the layperson would
not necessarily be aware of when you're
manufacturing it's not just about can
you make a CPU Intel could probably make
a CPU at ten nanometer or even a node or
even two nodes below if all they had to
make was one CPU and it could cost them
six million dollars to produce or
whatever the case may be but for them to
make it cost-effective enough that they
can bring these ten nanometer products
to market and actually sell them at a
price that would be acceptable to
consumers and competitive with their own
40 nanometer products well for that you
have to have a significant amount of the
wafer actually be usable and they can
accept small defects and you'll offer
see that in the form of something like a
core i5 or a core i3 welder will turn
off some cash or turn off a couple of
course that's perfectly acceptable but
for them to not ship at all means they
are not getting enough even usable dies
to productize the thing well we may
actually see AMD pull ahead and
performance then for a change cuz Rison
is awesome but it's still perk or not
quite as fast but what if that changes
by next year so one thing that's sort of
a a potentially sub AMD sleeve is that
we've seen second-generation Rison and I
mean whatever the hype train might have
said you know our thoughts on it we're
okay I mean yeah it's it's more better
for the same price I'm certainly not
gonna say no yeah you know send it back
make another towards the improvements
but there was nothing revolutionary
about it what we haven't seen from AMD
yet is something that they have clearly
indicated is on their roadmap and that
is n2 so that's an actual architectural
improvement to Xen that's more than just
okay we shrunk the nodes note a little
bit like at like a fraction of the node
down and we've reduced power consumption
a little bit even though it ended up not
actually amounting to much and we've
increased clock speed so can you imagine
what the world looks like where AMD
outperforms Intel
I like uh it's kind of exciting because
I think it'll light a fire under Intel
again and we've been saying this for a
long time it's gonna be weird consumer
wise because even if MD is a head of
Intel in that way it'll be interesting
to see how fast or even if the market
really shifts that much because people
have been ingrained to just buy Intel
stuff for so long now I'm gonna go ahead
I'm gonna say something that might be a
little unpopular with the AMD fanboys
out there I don't think it's going to
affect consumer choice very much at all
that's what that's where I was kind of
going with that is I think people are
still going to buy it
I think game yeah I think AMD's gonna
raise prices and the people who are
gonna by AMD are gonna buy em deep cuz
it's a good choice and the people who
buy Intel are gonna buy Intel well that
was kind of true back in the Pentium 4
days when you had Athlon XP yeah and in
particular I mean the Pentium 4 wasn't
even the worst because the Pentium 4
legitimately outperformed the Athlon XP
I mean us AMD people you know I had a
2500 plus and I overclocked it to a 2.2
gigahertz which would have made it a
3200 plus by bumping the frontside bus
from 333 to 400 ok no no crap no it was
from 266 2 3 3 whatever whatever it was
it was very confusing because AMD back
in those days would actually have
multiple models of the same processor at
different frontside bus speeds and then
just look like different multipliers and
because of board compatibility with
because remember that was back when
third-party chipsets existed yes right
remember via chipsets oh enforce faster
in the past I know right so so anyway I
had a 2500 plus and I had it overclocked
to a 3200 plus which AMD very
optimistically would compare to Intel's
3.2 gigahertz but if we're being honest
with ourselves I was one of those people
who was like you know what hyper
threading is not real processor cores so
you know what did my 32 Hydra plus is
like as good as your 3.2 gigahertz p4
but in actuality hyper threading was a
good thing and this wasn't something
that I actually discovered until dual
cores were sort of the norm and
enthusiasts circles and I got my hands
on a p4c 2.4 gigahertz so this was a
Northwood see and this was an m0
stepping this was a cool chip this is a
2.4 gigahertz chip that was capable of
like 4 + do people hunt that stuff as
much as they used to a P force a P for
800 seed a P for P for C 800 - EE Deluxe
that's an asus board from back in the
day that was actually the board that I
had that I was playing around with this
m0 stepping on and that m0 stepping was
out of like a salvage system someone had
given to me when I built them a new one
I was like oh you had no idea what you
had here I mean dual-core spur obviously
still better but I was like Oh
hyper-threading worked this is cool and
overclocked man that thing was fast
anyway
what am I talking about again right a p4
c800 a deluxe those still go for a
hundred bucks on eBay I look really I
looked at it last week because we're
planning like a blast from the past
machine and we want to overclock the
snot out of it and if you want to
overclock the snot out of a p4 see a
Pentium 4 C then you really do need a p4
see 800 e deluxe and so we are probably
going to pay $100 for a 10 year old
motherboard in the near future that's a
crime
$100 all I remember is that the pentium
threes were good and then the Athlon
scam out and I skipped most of the
Pentium 4s because frankly yes you could
get a Pentium 4 that was faster but it
costs so much more money than an Athlon
that's true
the board was more expensive the chip
was more expensive to get the most out
of it you need a dual channel memory
which back then was Lane you remember
that Rambis room crazy expensive yeah
Rambis room
I actually there's a gap in my PC
enthusiasm in between the Pentium 1 and
the p4 post Rambis so I never had to
deal with roundest memory you've never
had Rambis I have never had Rambis in
fact I don't think I've ever even talked
about it so feel
free to tell our audience for maybe the
first time they've ever heard about it
because they're if you if you listen to
our haters they're all kids so they yeah
go ahead and allege I wouldn't I
wouldn't want to put a hat on or
anything but basically Intel wanted a
piece of the RAM market oh did I say
that out loud so they wanted to get
everybody off of DDR Ram and they wanted
to go to Rambis because they had
royalties and patents on it it was
supposed to be faster and it was but it
had higher latency and other issues or
vice-versa
but essentially they thought that their
market clock would force everybody and
you could buy an Athlon instead which
used the cheaper DDR Ram and cheaper
boards and yes Pentium was ten twenty
percent faster but you paid double
triple the money for ten or twenty
percent speed its bacilli that would be
a tremendous video standards that intel
has pushed over the years that died got
Rambis we've gotten BTX we've got what
what else just like off the top of our
heads could we uh do you guys remember
five VI IV no oh man oh it was epic we
had this we had this like like demo kit
at the NCIX headquarters that I don't
think literally was ever taken out of
its box I've seen this logo yeah yeah
here hold on I'm gonna ha here here's an
Intel pressroom technology brief I'm
just gonna show you guys with my screen
on my screen here here it is yeah baby
Intel vibe maximize your home
entertainment experience
this is Intel's brand for in home
entertainment pcs designed to transform
how consumers manage share and enjoy a
broad and growing assortment of movies
programs music games and photos oh man
look at this look how like delightfully
2000s all of this looks I recognize all
the logos but don't remember it at all
it's probably cuz it's home theater and
I didn't care well the other thing too
is that it didn't matter at all because
anything was vive it was just kind of a
meaningless late
that you could put on an HTP see without
like it was like the multi p multimedia
PC standard back in the 90s V already
yeah like look at all like look at these
performance benchmarks they're like yes
a vive technology oh by the way it's a
pentium d processor and then they
compare it to just a p4 not vive and
they're like oh yes vive is much more
better but it actually is just like
better CPUs like here's a Core 2 Duo
versus a p45 71 what is the point
exactly that you're trying to make
would you consider Intel's Itanium to be
them trying to control 64-bit um you
know what I don't know enough about iti
tannic to really comment on it like in
an in-depth technical way because it was
server tech at a time when we did not
dabble in server tech at all
so what's your take because I feel like
you wouldn't ask me if you didn't have
an opinion well they were trying to move
the industry off of their traditional
x86 which of course AMD had a license to
and the idea was that they would have
something that they could have exclusive
and I'll bet an awful lot of people
today don't realize that the 64-bit
technology we use today is in Intel's
it's AMD's that Aniyah was Intel's
attempt to get everybody off a legacy
platform and sort of taking they've
tried multiple times over the years to
try to retake control of the of the of
the CPU business from AMD yeah it will
be considering all the stuff that
happened 15 years ago with pentium 4 and
am in Athlon if rise in 3 ends up being
7 nanometers before Intel gets there are
you adding this to like no no but I will
definitely I'm doing this during the
show no no I don't think you'll forget
that would be so that would be so much
fun so on the subject of all of this
lighting a fire under Intel's but I
think we've got time for one more topic
with you and I think
this is probably the best one Jim Keller
is joining Intel so this is posted by
num lock 21 on the forum and the
original article is WCC EFT XO whatever
you might think about them you can keep
it to yourself because this is like a
confirmed thing so just chill out but
basically I mean this is not even this
is not even this doesn't do justice to
to the guy's resume but it says AMD's
Zen and Athlon 64 CPU architect so
pretty much the only times that AMD has
built anything competitive with Intel in
the last ten years the architect behind
them Jim Keller has joined Intel so this
is after stints at Apple where I believe
was he working on CPU or GPU at Apple
dude dude do you remember no no I can't
I can't remember either and then he also
did did some time at Tesla so he left
AMD for Tesla most recently and then he
was at Apple in between AMD and AMD
again I think can't remember exactly but
basically the guy is a legend in the CPU
design business and so now he and Rajat
koduri who was the head of Radeon
technologies group under AMD are now
both at Intel so if there was any doubt
that Intel is making a big push here you
can put that to rest it's gonna be just
well he's he's he's he was essentially
played a key role or responsible for the
good CPUs that AMD frankly has ever
designed because I don't know if you
ever played around with the old K 6 and
K 5 chips back way back in the 90s but
they really struggled when they lost the
ability to copy Intel's designs I mean
all the way through the 386 and whatnot
they could copy Intel but then they had
to come up there k5 was late k5 was slow
competing with the Pentium and then k-6
was ok but then the k7 was Athlon and so
basically he did Athlon athletics he all
the way through until they switched over
to phenom and FX which he
wasn't involved with and then he did
rise and so basically he's done every
good CPU and he's ever done I mean
that's one way of putting it yep
and so he's joining as a senior vice
president leading the company's silicon
engineering which encompasses
system-on-chip development and
integration so he did a oh yeah okay
this is all in my notes did a multi-year
stint at Apple between contributions to
k-8 and coming back to work on Zen at
Apple he led the design team to build
the company's class-leading mobile
processors so in 2015 he left AMD to
join Tesla where he's been leading the
company's AI chip design teams to date
so if Tesla produces some kind of chip
design that is like freakin awesome in
the next year to for he will basically
definitely have had a hand in that I
mean what what does this mean for AMD
like they're gonna have a couple of good
years here because one of the things
that mr. Keller did I don't know what is
doctor I don't know I've never never
seen I mean it seems like there's a
pretty good chance anyway yeah one of
the things that Jim Keller did at AMD
was he set out a roadmap for Zen like
this is Zen one and then here's like
future generations of Zen like here's
here's it's all plotted out for you
but after that what do they do where do
you find another rock star like that
find good people and let them do their
thing
I mean it's become very challenging
though I mean in the early days chip
design was simple enough I mean
obviously it was already very
complicated but it was simple enough
that there could be many people
qualified to work on it as time goes on
for you to find someone with the
knowledge to work on current technology
and the experience of everything that's
come before it something that does have
a value and has a value more and more so
as the technology progresses to find
those people is going to become more and
more difficult and when you're AMD you
are competing with
Intel to attract those people and we can
see who is winning that battle right now
yeah it's not like he's retiring right
away that's one thing I was going to
look into is like is the old start gonna
be retiring but he's not quite at that
age yet so no we can keep leaning on
these guys that's gonna be interesting
alright well we got to jump into our
sponsors Jason thank you so much for
coming on the show we are absolutely
thrilled not just to have you on but

like breaker like it's it's insane
oh oh but just like in their house in
their house that they I think they have
Wi-Fi it like one of the cafes in the
city
really yes so you're going from complete
immersion in technology to like your
phone is basically a fancy Apple branded
decoration yes Wow how long are you
staying there a few weeks to a month
yeah so yeah wow that's exciting have
you given much thought to your plan
beyond that I feel like I'm interviewing
you I might as well ask you know what I
might as well ask some of some of the
questions that I'm sure people have on
their minds guys go ahead and post in
the twitch chat if you have any
questions for max I will do my best but
we're not gonna have a ton of time
because it's 559 and so officially in
one minute she's super doesn't work here
anymore and definitely doesn't have to
listen to me am i trespassing at that
point yeah do we have to like do we have
to escort her away no already taken all
my keys but you're a visitor okay so uh
favorite video project you worked on
while you were here oh I don't the one
at your house I forget which one but you
dressed up as a grandmother and tech
then versus now yeah that was that was
pretty fun that was pretty fun so we
were talking about sort of retro tech
and sorry so we were talking about sort
of differences between technology when I
was a kid and when my kids were a kid
and I guess technology from when I was a
kid was funny to you I suppose also it
involved a lot of costumes that was a
lot of fun a lot of cross-dressing
worst project where's this project I
already think I know what you're gonna
say and it was fun but it was also
pretty horrible go ahead you can say
yeah I mean I just I think I know what
it was I see if I get it right
well now I'm trying to think of what
you're thinkin oh no don't try to think
of anything and try to think of the
worst project you worked on the whole
time you're here
ah okay yeah I don't know CES was pretty
tough it wasn't the worst project but it
was like really really tough San
Francisco as well the AMD factory tour
that's what I was gonna say okay yeah
yeah Alan that was a little rough yep
like we flew out very early morning
didn't we we were up at like three and
then we worked cuz yeah it was like a
6:00 a.m. or like a 7:00 a.m. flight or
something stupid like that and then we
we landed and worked all day and then we
had another like 6 or 7 a.m. flight home
yeah I remember getting back I remember
getting a hotel like 9:30 or like 10
o'clock or something like that and you
were like set your alarm we're up at
2:00 a.m. and I was like okay and he
came back to the office I only lost him
too like we got there got here at like
10:00 a.m. yeah I think you stayed in
for like another 3 or 4 hours
yeah and like I didn't even ask you to I
thought I had to oh right yeah well like
okay I stayed cuz I didn't have a choice
like I had that whole trip was just kind
of a cluster
yeah because AMD sprung it on us at the
last minute and they were just like well
we're gonna have like the most exclusive
thing ever
it's a supercomputer made of Vegas and
we were like yo we have our LTX this was
a year ago holy crap so we were like
yeah we have our LTX Expo like like now
we need to know that we would need to be
there and back in one day and they're
like yeah we can make it happen okay
people are asking if you got fired
because you dropped the testbench you
know what I think it took Linus about a
year to think it over and then he
brought me into softens and you know
what I can't get over it no no we're
actually pretty chill and if I had to be
honest I don't think we've ever
addressed this publicly but if I had to
be honest about it that was at least 40%
my fault
get I'll take it I was the one who
propped it up like that that was me not
max you know what I said that doesn't
look like the best idea she did say that
however I did say max can you hold this
while I answer the door
and he trusted me during my probation oh
this is great
it is 6:02 I'm no longer your boss you
can answer honestly okay hold on let's
soon okay is Linus a good boss I don't
know someone else it's going like super
it's going super fast yeah you don't you
don't have to lie you don't have to lie
anymore
there's no pressures ya know like heat
ya was a great boss I know it's over
all right what else we got here um
pregnant remember everyone's to
everyone's touch what people are asking
you think I'm leaving cuz I'm pregnant
no I don't think you have to answer that
question someone has a question oh why
isn't your hair blue
I saw I've been wondering that I saw a
15 year old girl at Walmart and she had
literally the exact same hair as me um
it was really she was like following me
around like there was no way she needed
to be in the cereal aisle the same time
I was in the cereal aisle and so she
just like I don't know I felt really
stressed out and I had a hair
appointment the next day anyways and I
was like so we gotta get rid of this and
she's like let's just do it now and I
just blacked out woke up blonde hair
really mm-hmm
it was time did you feel old oh yeah I
get no it's just that I didn't want to
identify as somebody that has the same
hair is like a 15 year old so you felt
oh then yeah so whose time oh wow
I wish I'd asked before that's fantastic
twitch chat thinks all girls are
pregnant that's that's apparently why
that came up I don't I don't know I
don't spend enough time on twitch to uh
let's see if you want to take one more
question yeah okay sure let's do one
more
seventy-five is the answer um what's the
best part of the job here I don't work
here anymore I can't answer that I don't
know every thing it's pretty chill I
don't know I get totally hang out with
cool people and nice cameras it's
definitely not a desk job which is what
I had last time and wait so that was
really cool being able to totally do
different things every day and like walk
around be creative right yeah I think
some of your finest work was actually
one of the last things you shot here
this video right here is not up on it's
not up on YouTube yet but it's on
floatplane so I'm just gonna this one
yeah here we go and I believe you did
all the lighting for this didn't you so
at in the in the early in the early
parts of her tenure max relied on
Brandon a lot for help in terms of not
operating a camera necessarily but in
terms of lighting shots and and the
composition of her shots and all that
kind of stuff and she actually did this
whole video which I thought was
absolutely fantastic when I when I
watched it the other day including like
the sort of the black backdrop there the
the pedestals here this this is really
cool so in this part right here I'm
gonna walk from sort of an early model
end to a newer one I hope I have this
muted right now yeah my god muted right
now and we this was really janky the way
that we had to do it because we don't
have the proper equipment for it but I
thought it was really creative and just
really well done in a cool way
so yeah I don't know it kind of felt
like a fitting last project actually
because I
videos I think that we've ever done so
it was all James's idea I said do we
really have to do this well he goes yeah
let me see if I can just find one of the
spots where we have one of the the
movement bits it's ok here we go there
we go this is the part that I wanted to
I wanted to show you guys that
interlacing that wasn't that beautiful
yes so I put down the keyboard and with
a little bit of post work do you want to
tell them how this was shot because it's
yeah horrendous what are those things
dolly is not a dolly it's a handy mover
yeah it's like a handy mover so we had a
tripod with a red and a prompter and
like a little audio module that like we
had a boom plugged into and like we
sandbagged the tripod on to this handy
mover and we had we basically like the
way the Handy mover works you need to
move in one direction or else it like
gets all weird so I don't know I had it
like this I had one hand on the Handy
mover one hand on the handle at the red
and I just pulled it back and we had
Edie on the left side of me with just
like a soft box on wheels and he was
holding it back and then we had Dennis
booming and he was just walking back and
we had James as well like kind of a side
me with a bounce and he was walking back
with us and Linus had to do this while
reading off a prompter and like putting
a borrowed keyboard back on a pen so
carefully yeah not my keyboard like two
hundred three hundred dollar keyboard on
ebay because they're very rare a lot of
a lot of fun though okay last question
is for me Oh Kate are you going to ask
me for a reference huh I'm just I'm idly
curious I have not considered looking
for another job yet so haven't gone to
that point annoyed
maybe all right sounds good
well I think do we do the handshake
thing really
all right and on that note thank you
very much for all your time here and
have a great weekend of liberté I'm
gonna yeah or a month's Wi-Fi yeah have
a great life
all right see you max on that happy note
I return hey how's it going yeah
speaking of people who don't work here
anymore
Wow yeah actually no one was on the show
with you this week that works here yeah
how interesting you know what I'm gonna
call that a solo Rancho and I'm gonna
give myself an extra gold star for doing
a great job of the land show by myself
that's not how that works all right so
we've got other tech news I think but
honestly we actually don't have a ton of
time we're in we're in a negative time
yeah should we start - just like burn
through stuff pretty quick here by shirt
might
oh just putting your coffee away okay
well bye neck clinic you're not leaving
forever you might go crazy yeah Croatia
yeah sure whatever
have fun with no internet buddy gonna
enjoy that yeah I'm pretty sure no no
Wi-Fi no no it's just it's just no no I
understood what she meant they just
don't have like an internet line into
her grandparents house I think it's what
she's trying to say yeah yeah all right
okay
so Windows 10 redstone five gets
telephony api's telephony telephony oh
yeah thank you hinting at a surface
phone ready Microsoft might not have
learned their lesson but the API is
cover support for a range of typical
phone features including dialing numbers
and contacts blocking withheld numbers
support for Bluetooth headset
speakerphone mode etc there looks to be
some kind of video calling support
suggesting support for 3G or LTE video
calling I would love to see like this is
something I haven't been able to figure
out for the longest time this doesn't
necessarily mean they're gonna do a
phone again it could just mean they're
gonna add phone functionality to surface
devices which is hopefully what it is
like the for people that would care
about the other option yeah like I don't
like sorry good night disappointment
nothing person yeah their amount of
disappointment is not worth it
other good Microsoft News they rolled
out the Xbox April update which gives
you free sync over HDMI hmm
support for 1440p which paired with that
free sync support some free sync is on
all and 1440p is on the One X and the
one s means that you could be looking at
a significantly better gaming experience
if you're like living in a dorm and you
know on your monitor and you've got like
a cheap Korean monitor off of ebay or
whatever because there are ones with
free sync we actually did check one out
recently that was a fantastic value um
it's got support for Auto low latency
mode which will tell your television
that you're playing a game so it can
switch the display mode I didn't know
that yeah that's pretty cool
updated mixing mixer streaming service
to include the ability to share control
of a game with a user on mixer calm
that's actually pretty sick
unfortunately with all of this there is
no there's still no end game for a CEO
fees so what you want to do this one
wasn't posted by sc2 Mitch on the forum
go ahead what does that even mean I'm
posting this in the twitch chat but
apparently Finland is if I'm tripping
over myself
what is literally what does this mean
okay finland classifies eSports as a
traditional sport apparently there's a
quote that says eSports is now being
treated as a traditional sport in an
administrative sense okay though we
don't want to outweigh the importance of
traditional sports it's still but I
don't know what in an administrative
sense fools so there's some good stuff
here basically if if an eSports ee
athlete wants to come into the country
to compete an event for a good reason
obtaining visas as well so there's some
good stuff it'll help teams obtain
government funding if they're based in
the country and
tax benefits for athletes as well EF
Li's you know what a so that's cool I'm
never gonna do it I'm sorry but I'm
never gonna call them athletes I'm okay
with this they're you athletes okay it
takes an extremely high degree of skill
and precision and all this kind of stuff
but it's just a different form but it's
not athleticism it's a different form
and there can be benefits to that
extreme control from being at like an
athletic person and different being in
good athletic cardiovascular shape yeah
they're just not the same thing yes um
whoa if you were wondering if the mining
craze has reached the plateau and is
coming down
Taiwanese graphics card makers to see
shipments plunge 40 percent in April so
this includes gigabyte MSI and Toole
many clients have suspended taking
shipments in response to the drastic
slowdown in demand for cryptocurrency
mining machines many mining farm
operators are apparently awaiting the
rollout of a theory of mining machines
by China's bit main in the third quarter
of 2018
don't duh there's a rumor that Apple is
working on an 8k x 2 VR headset an 8k
display for each eye that would be
fantastic
I don't know how big this thing would be
the box would be powered by a custom
Apple processor that's more powerful
than anything currently available and it
would act as the brain for the headset
in its current state the box resembles a
PC tower but it won't be an actual Mac
computer there's a few things that I'm
really surprised aren't in the dock and
I don't have notes on it obviously but
to like stepping-stone you guys on to
looking at it to yourself there's
apparently a huge lawsuit going on right
now over Ram pricing that we just got a
bunch of news about there's a Eric
Lundgren is possibly going to prison for
repairing or for burning freeware onto
discs that isn't here and then oh it is
okay so that was posted by Ken blue 24
on the forum that actually is really
important to cover
let's go ahead and so an e-waste
activist gets 15 months in prison for
selling Windows Restore disks yeah so
these were downloaded from I don't know
if you guys are gonna remember this to
be completely honest but back in the day
you would get restored discs with your
laptop or your PC your desktop sorry and
now you can download them and burn them
yourself or put them on the flash drives
or whatever and he would charge as far
as I know he would charge 25 cents see
this charging footage is essentially
essentially disc yes like the physical
medium that he put it on - yeah
there are a few additional problems that
not a lot of people are putting light on
one of them is that apparently they were
labeled as like Microsoft Windows which
causes a big problem that's a big
intellectual property problem but that
was not the focus of the court case
right the focus of the court case was
apparently selling the software when
clearly the software is available for
download and cannot be activated without
a license a license key is what actually
matters here and he wasn't selling
license keys he was selling he was
selling helping people who had lost
their recovery disk get windows back on
their computer with their existing
lights in a really nice way because he
was helping you do it yourself and he
was doing it for 25 cents the cost of
the disk that doesn't doesn't properly
in my opinion clewd
labor that's like taking some business
away from him directly and Microsoft
apparently as far as I know went after
him for the perceived value so I think
it was like $20 a disc yeah so saying
that it was worth like almost
three-quarters of a million dollars and
apparently their problem with all of
this is that it is causing lost sales
but that is a very frankly
argument it's completely untrue because
those people already have a license for
Windows so we shouldn't be trying to
sell them another license for Windows
because they already have one and that
is what is known in the industry as a
dick move
so there's a couple of problems here he
did break the law he did sell
copyrighted material which is wrong and
bad and illegal but this kind of
behavior the intent because I'm a firm
believer that we should look not at the
action so much as at the intent like if
someone's like your dick that's
obviously really different from you know
what you're a really nice guy yeah so
there's what you say but there's what
you mean and in this case yes what he
did was technically incorrect and
technically illegal but it's the kind of
thing where I think a letter probably
would have done the trick and no and
like yeah it comes down to the the
basics of does the punishment match the
crime and this is right extremely not
the case if someone was driving down the
road at 200 kilometres an hour and they
blow through a school zone they would be
unlikely to get 15 months in prison in
spite of the fact that okay maybe no-one
actually gets hurt but they could have
really dangerous easily like you know
hit a rock at that kind of a speed in a
residential area and this thing this
kind of stuff happens they could have
easily like hit a rock and flown into
someone's house or like run over a bunch
of school children or whatever work they
hit they will fire it out and nail
someone they will not get 15 months in
prison and here we're talking about in
with as far as we can tell a good
intention
someone printing these discs and making
them available to people who are not
tech savvy enough to download them on
their own and we're putting this person
in prison for 15 months this really
doesn't make a ton of sense to me
someone in twitch chat was like right to
travel and honestly I don't blame the
courts for this I don't blame the law I
don't blame the court system I blame
Microsoft Microsoft should not be going
after this guy they should have sent a
strongly worded letter told him not to
do it and ideally created assist
where people can download these recovery
discs far more easily because as much as
the disk does usually say on it don't
lose this or you won't be able to
reinstall that's BS - there's absolutely
no reason why physical media it is 2018
there's no reason why physical media
should prevent you in any way from
installing and using your software that
you have a valid license for so I guess
that's all I have to say about that
there's there's yeah there's there's
legitimate issues with the use of yes
but they took it too far they should
have said don't use our logos that's
like someone uploading a meme on the
internet with my face in it and that's
immediately going straight to a lawsuit
rather than being like you know yo
you've crossed the line there you
actually can't use that we usually like
memes yeah we love it so go ahead please
do it I saw one with you and it recently
where it was like the four panel one and
you like run into an Apple store with
money in your hand have you seen I
posted that on Twitter it the loss means
yeah yeah it's fantastic so far nobody
sent that to me you know how I found it
for the first time ever read it I was
bored
oh I don't remember the last time I was
bored you got so much when you put my
kids were doing something and I like
needed to supervise them and I kind of
be there but like so I went to our /all
and I made it four pages in and I was
like holy crap that's me because it
wasn't in like pcmr or like any of the
places that I would normally pay
attention to where was it I'm gonna have
to check Linus Mac lost me right at that
I should bring it up ah no um Wow yeah I
don't think I'm even like mentioned in
it though yeah I can't even like I can't
even find it now I'll have to go on our
Twitter and like find our post of the
reddit page but like oh yeah cuz I
didn't send it to you because I had
noticed that you had posted it
No or was it your personal one no no it
was on the accompany one I figured it
was on topic enough yeah I think so
there we go no found this out okay for
crap I didn't I didn't I didn't say
where to read it dang it
that was funny my Mac loss rated iMac
loss nope yep
can't find it I'm sure someone who's
supposed to dit in twitch chat by now
yeah there's no twitch chat is full of
people complaining about reddit search

my summary of the Linus tech tips
controversies on it No oh wow that's
that's interesting the show is brought
to you by private Internet access
spectrum and LTX
and also this is weird I haven't even
fact I've never haven't even seen this
there is so much discussion of this I
think even more than the tampon thing I
love house on how stupid that is yeah
the top comment this is interesting it's
not like they were asking Apple to fix
it under warranty he said he was willing
and expecting to pay for it here's the
biggest issue
he's voided the warranty in a
spectacular way it doesn't matter even
if he pays double the cost of the Mac
just to fix it which would be super dumb
because you could never pay more than
the cost of the Mac to fix it
Apple then has to give a warranty on the
repair then that puts them in all sorts
of poo if something else is broken due
to his tampering no because nothing else
could be broken because the entire thing
would be brand new that's not how this
stuff works it's just you know what mom
will make a video later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
