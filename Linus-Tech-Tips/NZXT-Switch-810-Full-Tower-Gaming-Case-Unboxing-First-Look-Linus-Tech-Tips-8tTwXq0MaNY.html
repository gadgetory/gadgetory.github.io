this is one of those by popular demand
unboxings because there have been a lot
of requests for this unboxing and I can
see why because I've never seen it yet
in person but we're going to open it up
but NZXT seems to be fairly confident
about this guy
welcome to the pinnacle of chassis
design switches and epic good I'd like
to square around that word epic hybrid
Caseville for the hardcore pc enthusiast
this full tower chassis introduces a
first-of-its-kind concept for more
versatile and adaptable to any
configuration which is not grammatically
correct at all but I think we get the
point it can be modified for superior
water cooling or superb airflow through
seamless operation also doesn't really
need anything but I think we get the
point as an enthusiast you will have
full control to customize all the
features of the switch based on your
preference so what are these features
well first of all let's go through the
basic spec which is that we have four or
five no quarter-inch external base we
have six internal three-and-a-half inch
bays we have nine expansion slots so
this is a full-sized XL ATX chassis
meaning you can install even ludicrous
motherboards like the gigabyte g1
assassin which is nine slots long it
comes with it then it did the four 140
millimeter fans it can accept up to a
whole bunch of 140 millimeter fans but
you know what if you guys don't mind let
me get this out of here first because
it's kind of heavy and then we'll keep
going the switch 810 uses a hard foam
although it uses a very thick hard foam
which means that it's unlikely to get
damaged in shipping it's also not as
heavy as one of the cases that I really
harped on recently for using a hard foam
for packing which was the cosmos 2 which
weighs about 50 ah wait does it weigh 50
pounds yeah I think it weighed like 50
pounds before putting any hardware
in it the switching Tenley is somewhere
between 25 and 30 pounds before you put
any hardware in it which means that it's
less of a risk for damaging the packing
material during transit
so let's start having a look at all the
nifty features that drives NZXT to
proclaim that this is an ultimate case
let's start with the outside so at the
front we find ya you can stay over there
fine I'll just move the case around we
find four five and a quarter inch base
we've also got access to our front panel
connectors and just going to tilt that a
little bit so it's got some light 2 USB
2 2 USB 3 and SD card reader that's
handy love seeing that integrated right
into the case headphones microphone
reset pal and an LED switch interesting
so where's the power button ah the power
button is up on the top so that LED
switches for something that I'm about to
show you guys a little bit later that is
actually phenomenally cool ok we've also
got the power button up here so we saw
that just a moment ago the while we're
on the top this is really cool so check
this out you can open this up all the
way close it all the way so you can
actually choose between optimal air flow
and optimal silence which is kind of
neat we can also take the whole thing
off just like that and now we can see
the liquid cooling options that we have
so the radiator goes up here the barbs
stick down through here and we can
install up to a triple radiator in the
top of this case without even taking out
any of the spaces inside other than
leaving the default fans where they are
so you can either do triple 140s triple
120s or you can throw a radiator in
there either air or liquid cooling
doesn't really matter the choice is
yours so I'm going to go ahead
and there we are I'm going to put that
in silence mood so now let's go ahead
and have a look at the rest of the front
of the case so we've got a hold on how
does this work
look at that front accessible bottom fan
filter now there's an innovation because
I had I've sort of started complaining
about cases that have a bottom fan
filter but it's only accessible from the
back this is even easier to get at than
the ones that do it from the side so
that's very very cool the front comes
off pretty easily here we've also got a
removable fan filter here although it is
held in with screws it's fairly
accessible so you shouldn't have you see
that huge gap there you shouldn't have
much trouble blowing it out from the
back and then just giving it a quick aa
quick and blow from the side to get rid
of the dust bunnies we've got space for
dual 140 s or dual 120 s in the front it
comes with one 140 millimeter fan so I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to put
this back on it just uses a hold on
there we go little click ease in order
to hold it in place so I think that
pretty much does it for the Oh check
this out - a cool okay so let's turn the
round remember that toggle switch I
showed you guys next to the reset switch
I'm going to show you guys what that's
for that's very cool check this up
there's a light right here there's an
LED light that toggle switch turns it on
so that you can easily see the i/o on
your computer even setting it up at a
dark land party or in a dark room or in
the dark pretty much and what's neat
about that is it shines all the way down
so that you can you don't have to fumble
around and try and figure out what
you're doing now this one is accessible
from the back so once again not my
favorite although what they've done by
having one in the front one in the back
as we made it a lot shorter the problem
I have with cases like an 800 D is the
fan filters this long which means it has
to be this far away from the wall in
order to get it out this is actually not
that bad at all bottom mounted power
supply water cooling grommets which I
can't imagine anybody using in a case
like this that has proper support for a
triple radiator inside so but they're
but they're there in case you want to do
an external external radiator pump sort
of setup
if the urge strikes you so let's go
ahead and get this opened up NZXT has
traditionally done a very good job of
matching their whites on their plastic
to the whites on their paint finish I'd
say this one isn't quite as close as the
centum but it's still very good so I'm
not gonna take any marks off for it
let's go ahead and take this off nice
big window love the nice big window I
mean I know it's kind of fashionable to
change the shape of the window
dramatically or make it small or arrow
shaped or whatever the case may be not a
big fan personally if I'm going to want
a window if I'm going to have Hardware
inside that's window worthy I'm going to
want a nice big window so now that we're
inside here we go this bad boy supports
everything you can see all the different
standards on here ATX micro ATX mini ATX
flex ATX SSI CED SSI ee b so what that
means is we've got support for large
large motherboards even extended ATX
motherboards as well as XL ATX
motherboards so those ones aren't
actually even on here but with nine
expansion slots XL ATX is no problem and
you can see this width over here with
the e on it even though yeah yeah so
that's pretty much a e-atx so very very
cool CPU cut out gives us the ability to
change the CPU cooler without any
difficulty this has become pretty much a
standard feature these days the back
fans are cool because you can either do
a single 140 millimeter or see these
slots here you can actually change up
the configuration of the fence so you
can do dual 120 s by using the inside
slot can you do dual 120 s I think you
can actually give me a sec here guys
sorry guys my dad it's not dual 120 it's
single 120 or 140 but what these slots
allow you to do is position the fan
according to how thick the radiators and
fans you have installed in the top are
where your CPU socket is so where you
want the heat exhausted from so that is
a very very cool little feature now in
terms of cable management you can see
we've got umpteen bajillion cable
management holes depending on where your
motherboards position you're going to
want to run these differently there's
also a ton of space on the other side so
you can run 80
Eck's cables multiple pci express
graphics cables whatever it is that you
want without any hassle and these are
all using very high quality rubber you
can see that I can easily bend them
really far away and they go right back
to covering up the hole we've also got a
gap up here for the eight pin or eight
pins that go into your motherboard which
means that we're pretty much managed in
terms of which cables we need to be able
to run we've got another intake down
here so this is what that front filter
was for you can see the filters meet up
right about here that's what makes the
back one not too long and we can install
either 120 or a 140 millimeter intake
here we've got little rubber off a
little rubber feet that hold up the
power supply so whether you have a short
power supply or a long power supply
whether you mount fan side up or fan
side down it's not going to have any
problems getting all the air it needs
from either a filtered intake or from
the inside of the case let me see so you
can see the top from the inside that's
where the radiator goes what's also cool
about this is that you can install fans
all the way over here without
interfering with your top five and a
quarter inch bay so you've got the
radiator up top the fan here and your
first five and a quarter inch bay right
here so yeah it will perform quite as
well as these two but at least you don't
have to I personally I find it not very
aesthetically pleasing to put my first
optical drive in the second day so you
won't have to do that in this case they
did think of that we've got a hot-swap
SATA cage here which is very cool and I
didn't even notice the first time around
let's go ahead and pull that off there
we are
check that out just like that you can
install either a tune a half inch or a
three and a half inch drive solid metal
construction so no worries in terms of
any kind of durability issues that you
might you know potentially worry about
with some kind of hot swap with some hot
swap mechanisms also this looks like a
straight pass through so I hope there
won't be any compatibility issues now
this is cool check this out guys two one
is that these cages are completely
removable so you just go ahead
and remove the thumbscrews and check out
these episode oh sorry sorry still held
in I mean this will allow you to install
an unlimited length graphics card in
here per notch but I'm sure you'll still
want some hard drive cages oops
ohh slicks giving me a whole fan is
plugged in ok well hold on a second guys
and I'm going to show you removing the
side panel correctly this time the last
time I took out all three screws you
don't actually have to do that
you just move this screw down after
you've taken out the top and the bottom
and the side panel comes off just like
that let's go ahead and unplug that fan
which is going to be somewhat
challenging because I they are all cable
tight neatly back here for me so I'm
just going to pull out my trusty knife
hoping that I don't slice any of the
cables while I'm at it because the knife
is crazy dull and out there we go and
we're gonna go ahead and pull this guy
out of the integrated fan controller
which I didn't even know was back here
check that out
one molex power goes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
fans ah ah ah very very very cool while
we're at the back here we might as well
look at what we've got in terms of cable
management so you can see the side panel
goes all the way out to here which means
that by the time you get up to this
level you've got that much space for
cabling which is pretty much unlimited
as far as as far as those things go so
with these 7 you can do two in the front
three in the top one in the back one for
your CPU and have the whole thing
controlled it's tucked on with double
sided velcro so you don't have to keep
it if you don't want you can reposition
it if you want which is a very very
thoughtful thing some cases have
built-in fan controllers but they don't
allow you to reposition them so you're
stuck routing cables to maybe somewhere
that's inconvenient for your build this
allows for more customization than that
from this side you can see the tool
lists hard drive slits so these are
three and a half inch or two and a half
inch whichever you prefer we've got six
of those now plus the hot swap one here
you can also see the tool the size of
the five and a quarter inch base so you
can put screws in here
but you absolutely do not have to and I
think that covers it for the back other
than that we've got lots of cable
management loops here you see all these
loops these are going to allow you to be
much much tidier than a lot of cases
about routing your cables don't
underestimate the importance of these
they're very very cool so now let's
switch it around to the other side where
we left off with me trying to yank a
cable out of somewhere not here so got
my handles here those snap back into
place what's cool about these is that
not only do they hold hard drives but
check this out all year so I've got a
little plastic piece here so it doesn't
get scratched you can lock it in place
just by tightening the thumb screw and
then you can loosen it push it down like
that so what's the benefit of that you
might ask the benefit I'm just going to
throw this back in here there we go the
benefit is that if you're not as focused
in your build on beast graphics cards
you can actually reposition this for
better cooling more airflow for your CPU
just very neat you can actually position
this bottom one as well so you can point
these fans wherever you need the cooling
most in order to get the best
performance out of your system both of
these hard drive cages can be removed in
fact why don't we remove them just to
show you guys what it's gonna look like
with them both out so I'm gonna make
sure I have that
oh yeah there's no fan plugged into that
one right now so it's no problem there
we go one there one there so that's what
the switch 810 is going to look like if
you pull the whole thing out in fact I
would even speculate that by removing
these screws you could probably throw
another dual 120 millimeter radiator in
here with a little bit of work so that's
very cool yeah you can unscrew these
sleds as well so you can make the whole
thing out completely love seeing cases
that are less riveted and more screwed
because it means you can take things
apart more customized more and get your
build exactly the way you want it's one
of the reasons I chose my case because
the whole thing is held together with
screws
not a single rivet in the entire thing
there's our tool is five and a quarter
inch I actually like NZXT implementation
I can't for the life of me remember how
it works thank you push on this you
unblock it hold on and there you go then
you push on that snap it back in place
lock it into place just like that all
the screws that you need for your
optical drives just in case you are
going to ship your system around or
whatever the case may be are all
included here although there are a few
accessories in a box in a three-year
court three and a half inch drive cage
take it off and let's see what NZXT
includes with the switch eight ten
screws hey look at that an eight pin
extension very very well thought-out
and it's one of those cool individually
sleeved ones so this is a tall case
being XL ATX this is a very long
distance from your power supply to the
top so what this does is it buys you so
putting this through the back like this
down to approximately where it'll be on
your motherboard it buys you an extra
few inches on the back to make sure that
even if you have a cheaper power supply
that has shorter cables you're not going
to run into any trouble so thank you for
