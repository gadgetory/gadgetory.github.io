of scrapyard Wars J's not to be confused
with the rapper jay-z mentioned that LG
had a TV coming that they said was good
for gaming and I was like what the hell
LG I've been bitching about the input
leg on your TVs since we met why wasn't
I told about this and they were like oh
yeah so we have this nano cell TV that's
coming out and it has less processing
delay so I was like hook me up so I can
make a video and they did so I did
the Corsair one features a compact form
factor that is fast quiet and you
guessed it compact check it out through
Amazon or Newegg at the links below
first impressions of the LG 55 SJ 8500
it looks pretty damn good the bezels are
thin and the metal along the outside
looks sharp I mean it's hard to explain
exactly what makes a TV aesthetic work
but this design got the job done for us
and you know what else looks good
anything you toss up on the screen the
Grand Tour in 4k with HDR on Amazon
Prime video looks awesome car stuff you
can already tell Alex worked on this
video and the speakers are reasonably
loud and clear now to be clear our nano
cell TV had the misfortune of being set
up side by side with LG's w7 OLED
wallpaper TV and it's not as good as
that the black levels available on the
OLED TV are simply stunning and it is
physically impossible for any modern LCD
screen to achieve perfect black levels
like that
but at half the price of LG's least
expensive OLED it's a pretty compelling
picture
LG's biggest claim for their nano cell
tech which seems to be basically their
branding for quantum dot is accurate
colors from any viewing angle up to 60
degrees which from our testing actually
holds up pretty well what they didn't
mention though is that the contrast
isn't quite as good from a wider angle
from straight on black sir well black
but as you go to the side black areas of
the scene look more gray and less
detailed you won't encounter this on an
OLED anyway back to the original
question though is there any credence to
the claims that it's good for gaming
well the picture looks significantly
less processed in game mode suggesting
that well there might be less processing
going on but I still find this claim
confusing
as far as pure technology goes the OLED
pixels should switch much faster nearly
instantaneously so why would it be then
that a more expensive TV would be slower
than in any way is it possible that
these OLED pixels are harder to drive or
there's more processing left on in game
mode meaning that the LCD nano cell TV
might be able to edge out a win
well we fired up csgo to try them side
by side and see if we could eyeball out
a clear Victor and from this completely
non-scientific test it did seem that the
nano cell was offering a smoother gaming
experience movements felt quicker than
the OLED which sort of felt jelly-like
in comparison so to confirm we pulled
out the 240 FPS camera all right
so firing off around we wait the OLED is
faster we checked this over and over but
side by side the OLED was about eight
milliseconds faster even stranger the
nano Cell TV and our benchmark for true
haste the asus rog swift 258 q at sixty
Hertz for fairness were near to
identical to each other as well this
seemed a bit strange so we decided to
get pure input lag numbers using the
makeymakey
for this test when the two leads are
touched together the LED on the board
lights up and sends a mouse click to the
computer so we can measure the delay
between a click and an action on-screen
after consulting our footage we
determined that our OLED delay is about
32 milliseconds and the nano cell was
about 40 this actually maybe make sense
given the approximately 8 milliseconds
times of good LCDs compared to near
instant for OLED but that doesn't mean
that like a gaming monitor for example
can't perform any better than a TV our
ROG monitor managed a mere
16 millisecond delay once we turned it
up to 240 Hertz not to mention the extra
frames that it displays man that
animation looks good the point of that
though isn't to take away from the
result of the nano Cell TV
I mean sure professional csgo players
won't be using one anytime soon but I've
used TVs before with over a hundred
milliseconds of input lag that are
straight-up nauseating and forty
milliseconds is comparable to a 60 Hertz
gaming monitor we're not quite done with
this video yet though why did we
initially think that the LCD was faster
than the OLED well it turns out that the
crazy pixel response time on the OLED
can feel like a disadvantage when you
don't have vertical sync on the
divisions between the partial frames
getting sent to the display are very
obvious and it makes for a clear line
where the GPU was spitting out the frame
at that instant whereas the slower
pixels on the LCD make it a little bit
blurrier and less obvious so then the
solution Hey LG consult our recent we
designed the perfect TV video and put
freaking g-sync on the OLED display then
you can have your cake and eat it too
but until then TLDR the LG nano cell TV
is great for watching TV shows and
movies with the added bonus that unlike
previous LG TVs they're finally taking
gaming seriously so it won't make you
hurl when you boot up rocket league
