100 ish dollars at 97 motherboard
showdown this video got bumped back many
times from CES to getting sick twice and
the GTX 960 launched etc but enough with
excuses the show must go on
as with the previous two videos we will
be exploring the world of affordable
motherboards instead of top-tier
motherboards which are expensive and
don't really impact performance we are
doing this because we want to explore
the pros and cons and trade-offs of
boards people are actually buying in
this video we will be covering the UEFI
BIOS experience of each board things
like USB Drive peripherals Ram
compatibility all that kind of stuff and
other things just the usability of the
motherboard also stay subscribed for
part 4 where we will be covering the
finished system experience and the final
conclusion of this whole series cooler
masters casemod world series is your
opportunity to show off your modding
skills and win great prizes entries
closed February 7th 2015 click now to
learn more I was delightfully surprised
when each board not only worked with
every keyboard and mouse but also was
able to post with XMP for each Ram kit
what was expected and yet no less
incredibly frustrating however was the
issues that I encountered with flash
drive compatibility there are a few
things more frustrating than being stuck
with a board that needs a UEFI BIOS
update no optical drive and a flash
drive that won't detect but that being
said this may not be that big of an
issue as many of you probably have a few
old flash drives laying around which
tend to work a lot more often but
whether it's during an update or
something else what if your UEFI BIOS
gets corrupted how will you recover well
luckily the gigabyte board comes with
dual UEFI BIOS support so you can easily
just switch from your corrupted one to a
fresh new one in basically no time but
also noteworthy is that da soos board
and the
as rock board has swappable BIOS chips
which may be a little annoying is you
would need to contact a manufacturer for
a replacement but at least it gives you
the option of repairing your board while
MSI includes no actual other safeguards
now on to what I know a lot of you have
been actually waiting for the actual
usability of the UEFI BIOS but a few
disclaimers bus must be made here first
each one of these UEFI BIOS setups could
have easily taken an entire video
dedicated to them naturally I will be
focusing on what makes each of these
experiences unique instead at their core
they all provide the same general
functionality you can review core system
specs change your boot device set up a
password for system boot etc as there is
virtually no difference in the
overclocking capabilities due to Intel
moving more and more things onto the
chip every time this leaves ease-of-use
quirks and standout features as the
focus of this segment
another important disclaimer is that
many things that I talked about will be
my opinion but for your convenience I
will be including as much footage of
each UEFI BIOS as possible
so you can come to your own conclusions
well start with a Seuss the easy mode
start page is amazing to be honest
before writing this review I would
always skip right over the easy mode and
go into advanced mode right away but
once I actually looked at it it has
almost everything an average user will
need to access quickly system
information RAM SATA configuration easy
tuning boot priority and a boot menu for
overriding boot order if you need to one
off boot to something like say a flash
drive XMP settings irst on or off and a
dedicated fan control setting which
includes four different profiles manual
control which is fantastic in
granularity of seemingly 1% a PWM or DC
switch and a quick view for what fans
are plugged in and their current status
along with various helpful keyboard
shortcuts clearly labeled along the
bottom
moving on to Advanced Mode we have all
the detailed fine-tuning options that
you would expect out of an advanced mode
and all of these options are under
sensible headers along with a
tattled hardware monitor nicely and
permanently fixed on the right hand side
the hot keys are no longer against the
bottom like there were an easy mode but
you can find a handy list available in
the top right hand corner which will lay
them all out for you there's also a
favorite section which you can add
things to so if you know you're going to
commonly be tweaking something you can
add it there there's also the nice
additional functionality of an in BIOS
notepad if you need to leave reminders
for yourself of various feature
information also at any time you can
check what has recently been changed
which is great but even more helpful
than that is the details of what has
changed this visit which will pop up
when you save and exit from your UEFI
BIOS next up we have as rock as orc
didn't have a QuickStart page but you
can decide what page are you AFI will
boot into and that's quite handy and
there's a UEFI guide wait what what the
f is UEFI guide what first I thought it
was going to be essentially Microsoft's
Clippy but for you if I turns out I was
wrong
the guide basically gives you a tour of
as rocks UEFI and tries to tell you how
things work for complete beginners it
does contain some useful nuggets of
information but the implementation could
have been a lot better
it starts with please remain seated and
keep your hands away from the mouse and
keyboard at all times and I think to a
degree they were actually serious other
than pressing escape to abort the guy
doesn't have any real functionality no
paws no forward or back nothing so let's
just move on there's a favorite section
on the main page it's a selectable
button that you can file things under
not its own page like some other
implementations but to each their own
and there's no real hotkey information
list which I found a little annoying you
can find hotkeys associated by certain
functions by highlighting them but that
doesn't really help you unless you
memorize them especially since so many
different boards have different keys for
different things other than f10 which is
generally being save and exit one
unexpected feature is their dehumidifier
function that turns the computer on and
spins the fan if it detects excessive
humidity you can check out as rocks
video about this here
overall as rocks UAF I'd lay out feels a
little outdated and unexceptional that
doesn't make it bad it gets the job done
without a bunch of extra junk in the way
and that might be exactly what you're
looking for then we come to gigabyte
right off the top I have to say this
UEFI is aesthetically great overall I'm
happy to see that they included a
startup guide which is essentially quick
settings right when you enter the BIOS
although it could maybe do with some
more useful selections considering
system language system time security
load defaults and exit are over half the
buttons I think it would be more likely
to get used if it had some more commonly
access settings and additionally you
still have to click through these in
order to get to those settings anyways
as they are just essentially large
shortcuts which kind of defeats the
purpose of having a quick screen in my
opinion but speaking of defeating the
purpose and all that ranting aside you
can choose what menu type you want to
boot into by clicking on startup options
and changing the selected box now hold
up wait a minute you might be wondering
what is smart tweak mode and if there's
smart tweak mode what is classic mode
well before we went into startup options
did you notice those little gray lines
on the left and right hand side yeah
those ones well
they turn into arrows when you highlight
them the left one puts you into smart
tweak mode and the right arrow puts you
into classic mode classic mode is pretty
much exactly what you would expect it
looks a little old or should I say
classic everything is right about where
you'd expect it to be there's no real
surprises frills or gimmicks but your
hotkeys are nicely laid out along the
right-hand side along with any
additional extra information about
whatever you have currently selected
it's nice enough but a little boring so
what exactly is smart tweak mode smart
tweak mode is essentially another skin
for UEFI so yes there are two different
skin options for your UEFI BIOS and a
quick options UI holy crap anyway smart
tweak mode is the one I'd use it looks
wonderfully modern and it runs at up to
1080p on supported monitors and has a
cool high-res graphic in the background
and nicely detailed status information
wrapping around the outside of your
settings menus for some weird reason
that goes away when you select save and
exit tab which is a little weird
and your hotkey information is on an
unnecessarily scrolling bar along the
bottom which should really just stay put
so you can actually read everything
instead of waiting for it to come back
around but aside from some minor
weirdness everything seems to be fairly
logically laid out with the major tabs
being broken up into sub tabs that
mostly remove the need to scroll by
making it so that nearly everything is
above the fold which is a nice touch
last but possibly not least we have MSI
for whatever reason when I first moved
it into Emma sized UEFI BIOS I didn't
realize that anything in the top blue
ribbon was clickable it just looked like
static information at first that you
would change elsewhere in the UEFI
eventually I clued in to the very
obvious fact that you're able to
interact with this area in order to
change your boot order OC Genie and XMP
settings quickly and easily which is a
nice mix of adding a quick selection
menu but also not adding additional
clicks for a user that just wants to
actually get to what they needed because
they're more advanced moving on to the
extremely large clickable buttons we
find that the settings OC em flash and
OC profile areas are pretty standard
fare no surprises here but once you get
to hardware monitor and board explore
things get a little bit more interesting
starting with hardware monitor you have
manual control of all your fans
including four different levels of
control while you have them in smart fan
mode and one level of control when
they're not in smart fan mode you also
have the options to set all of your fans
to full speed set all of your fans to
the default curve or cancel everything
out board Explorer is a cool little tool
that will allow you to see a graphical
representation of what things are
connected to your motherboard you can
see what fan headers are populated and
how fast they're spinning what I always
filled on the back yard board and what
SATA headers are filled and the
corresponding drive that is connected to
them amongst other things one gripe that
I did have with Emma size UEFI
was odd most growing issues where I
would try to scroll down but
instead of the selection going down it
would keep jumping up to where my mouse
was or we're out scrolling making
navigation by scrolling rather
frustrating and resulting in relying on
my keyboard for everything other than
clicking on large buttons something that
I was hoping we would have moved on from
this far into the UEFI game so kudos to
you if you've made it this far through
the video the prize is the conclusion
because for the first time in this
series we need to declare a winner and a
runner-up some explanation is needed for
why we didn't do this before and that is
because the answer was well it depends
on whatever ports you need or what color
bets you're wearing or whatever things
are outside of our control but for this
one we wanted to assign an overall
ranking for non bugginess and general
ease-of-use my top rated board was a
soos with MSI as a runner-up both of
these boards worked with every USB
device we tested them with both of these
board had detailed and well implemented
fan controls and both of these boards
had a well implemented quick selection
menu although I liked a soos is a bit
more and a soos didn't have issues with
most scrolling which is why they took
home the gold medal today but in the end
mine is not the only opinion so let's
hear what you guys have to say about
these UEFI BIOS implementations let me
know what you like the most in the
comments down below or if you want to
have me actually read them answer over
on the forum
alright guys while you're down below
commenting on which you if I set up you
liked the most
don't forget to like or dislike this
video depending on the color of your
pants I guess favorite subscribe if you
haven't for some reason already done
that and share this video if you want to
help people pick a motherboard over on
the forum comment there so that I
actually read it if you want to get if
you want to get rid of ads because there
aren't any right now there probably will
be soon but there aren't any right now
become a contributor also we have
something pretty cool coming for the
contributors and other users of the
forum fairly soon so stay tuned for that
if you want to buy a shirt that isn't a
purple twit shirt but has cooler stuff
on it like keep on digging check out the
shirt description down below this video
and thank you for watching I'll see you
next time
oh my goodness that was almost really
bad this is not a shirt that you can buy
Linus thought it was a shirt you could
buy it's not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
