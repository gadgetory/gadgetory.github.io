for sleeper pcs so that's to say like
ancient junker looking cases with just
the most tricked-out water-cooled
overclocks of systems inside them that
can absolutely shred the latest Triple A
games while looking like they came
straight out of the 70s 80s and 90s so
what if we were to take instead of the
best components and give them the
old-school treatment the oldest
components and give them the new-school
treatment I mean tempered glass RGB
water cooling full cover blocks pretty
much the works so that's the goal today
but rather than just taking some
entry-level hardware and putting some
lights and cooling tubes on it instead
we put together my dream PC not my dream
PC today mind you my dream PC from when
I was in high school
2004 this was the best of the best and
we are gonna do it up with glass where
you can instantly see your current and
past network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Linus and
get 25% off glass wire at the link below
most of this stuff predates your PC
enthusiast today's yeah I was like 11 or
so when this came out okay fair enough
now in fairness to me I wasn't actually
that much older but I was definitely
getting into the custom PC scene and I
remember from being a kid this being
pretty much my dream CPU this was the
Pentium for Northwoods C revision that
means you've got an 800 megahertz
frontside bus on this puppy much faster
than the 533 of the north would be core
Wow it's 2.4 gigahertz which means yes
technically this wasn't actually the
fastest CPU on the block but wait this
is three gigahertz
yeah I specifically asked for a 2.4 C do
we have one we do moving on this is what
I was really after so yes technically
the 2.4 gigahertz chip was not the
fastest one but what it was was the
lowest-cost one that was overclockable
to well beyond the fastest thing you
could buy from Intel at the time so we
went out of our way to scour eBay for
2.4 C's with the m0 stepping these
things were known to overclock
well in excess of 3 gigahertz maybe even
over 4 remember this is a 2.4 gigahertz
chip imagine getting like an 80%
overclock on something today now the
performance still isn't gonna be great
because compared to a coffee like CPU
which does about what is it 32
instructions per clock single precision
this is sitting at around 8 and it's
only a single core hyper-threaded 32-bit
chip so Windows XP anyone should bring
it well I think now let's take a look at
our motherboard so this right here is
the biggest baddest motherboard that
ever existed for socket 478 it's got
pretty much everything you could want
you've got your AGP yeah 5 PCI oh yeah
that's SATA and in addition to say that
you got not one not two but three IDE
ports meaning this thing could support a
total of 10 hard drives
and a single floppy nice it even had
like fairly modern features like Gigabit
LAN coaxial audio out some of these are
less modern there's no USB 3 or anything
like that but who's paying attention
have you ever installed a socket 478 CPU
before I I think so okay you want to do
it sure
there's your arrow hold on 22 that you
lift up the plastic arm goes out and up
there we go beautiful
can you help I don't want you to break
it I don't need help
we have two of them that's fine that is
a terrible terrible approach I have a
look at the pins and make sure they're
not bad yeah I feel like one of them
might be yeah there's a slightly bent
one okay so there's a bit of a technique
for this you just have to kind of wiggle
wobble it okay okay do you have thermal
compound no one moment while he's gone
I'm gonna do a bit of a retro peel on
our OCZ
Platinum Edition enhanced latency dual
channel two gigabyte kit check this out
whoever owned these for all these years
never peeled the logo I actually still
love this heat spreader design it does
look really good
you could polish them up like really
mirror shiny I think honestly the only
reason that they don't still do it this
way is that it's more expensive like
these modules are heavy these are made
of solid copper oh wow that feels good
doesn't it
so these right here are 400 megahertz
kits the tips in them are probably TC
CDs so two three - gasps - at 2.8 volts
by modern standards also a lot of
voltage for memory I'm actually super
pleased with how good the condition of
all this is no leaky caps a little bit
of dust I'm so excited for this build
yeah I was a bit afraid going into it
that we have to like recap basically the
whole board before getting it
operational but no these look great yeah
so we didn't think we were going to be
able to achieve quite the modern look
without at least springing for a modern
case so we went with a fan text and
through we evolved tempered glass just
great kind of starting point for any
build pretty clean looking
this is gonna turn out really really
nicely so one question with hardware
this ol are going to have to have a CD
player and a CD player I think you mean
an optical drive is this the i/o shield
that we had for this really doesn't look
like it yeah I guess we're making one of
those oh man it is an extra slap in the
face though that they like included the
wrong one especially after how much we
paid for this thing yeah that was what
150 bucks something like that that was
with the CPU though not this CPU yeah I
didn't want that CPU though the only
other modern core component we're using
is a see sonic prime Platinum 1300 watt
cedi plus platinum it's totally overkill
but while we could go back and find
something like an N Tech true power for
30 watt or something like that
the odds of a power supply that old
being a hundred percent reliable are
significantly lower than just grabbing a
new power supply and using that and we
really don't want to break our hardware
you know what the crazy thing is though
all this cabling still actually works
like I don't even know why it is that
they do it this way but on this 1300
watt power supply the 24 pin connector
still breaks away to a 20 pin and the 8
pin CPU power connector still breaks out
into a 4 plus 4 try and think of like
something else that maintain inter
compatibility for 15 years my
grandparents yeah so that's actually all
we need for wiring we can go ahead and
put it in I really like these like power
supply you like do all the screws and
then you just slide it in all right our
boards wired up I think it's time for us
to move on so we did allow ourselves to
take some artistic liberties with the
actual year that the hardware came out
so this right here is pretty much as
good as it got for an AGP graphics card
this is the geforce 6800 ultra it was
built on the hundred and
30 nanometer process it's got to molex
connectors and consumed a total of a
hundred and ten watts for older games at
the sort of target resolution of 1600 by
1200 this thing was an absolute monster
yeah I was looking up some of the
reviews apparently it was like twice as
fast as anything that existed before it
yep well that was back when hardware
used to move it that kind of a pace like
pretty much every generation that came
out turned your previous investment into
complete garbage that's one thing I
don't miss mismatched PCB colors oh
maybe we could just take like the back
plate off of a Titan or something like
that
and smack it on well that could work
modding a back plate I like it
not even bought him he just double-sided
tape it on another thing that I read
about this graphics card is that you had
to be really careful about not using
molex that are on the same rail because
apparently could kill your power supply
yeah that was back when a high end power
supply was 400 watts total I think
though oh it has a game port is that a
thing oh yeah cool this port have HD or
AC 97 audio oh of course
how did we overlook this sound card
sound cards Wow yeah onboard audio was
just like throwaway anyway so why bother
having a front panel header for it you
know that this case doesn't actually
have a five and a quarter inch Bay right
well lots of cases don't have things
that can be solved with a bit of
massaging ah we could probably just
mount it like down in here like below in
front of the power supply you'd have to
like open the panel it wouldn't be
convenient at all what happens if you
want to load games on it that way I
think that's a hard no so this is a
Western Digital Raptor X and this hails
from a time when hard drives could be
cool so this is a 10,000 rpm drive which
decreased seek times and you can
actually see the seek head moving around
while the drives operating so we have to
find a way to get this mounted
in like a prominent like place of honor
inside the rig maybe with like some spot
lighting on it again this is a little a
little bit so let's be careful here
that's that's barely in as far as things
we don't want to drop in this build I
think that's number one this one would
be pretty hard to replace so we're we
really hooking this thing up to like a
modern gaming monitor yep
I guess getting our hands on an old like
aperture grille or shadow mask CRT it's
probably a lot to ask well so this is
just making sure that the core bits work
you want to do the honors
press it I'm kind of scared I hope it
works man back when stock fans sounded
like that
aftermarket cooling really made a lot of
sense for everyone
oh hey what what huh nice oh man look at
all these like amazing old overclocking
options it's beautiful huh
now I'm really excited I guess what
would you play on the system like Unreal
Tournament you could play as some do not
the recent do the other doom but not the
really old doom see this is why company
shouldn't call games the same thing it's
funny the AMD fanboys at the time of
which I was one we're all like hyper
threading it doesn't make much of a
difference and then it wasn't until a
few years later that I actually got my
hands on one of these combos that I
subsequently got rid of that I actually
tried hyper threading and I was like oh
oh yeah I know I made a difference it
was pretty common in those days to have
multiple different controller chips for
the different storage ports on your
board because Intel zone and AMD's for
that matter own chipsets didn't support
a ton of drives so with these fully
featured boards they'd go and they'd
throw usually it was promised for the
early say two days and did that just
boot yep okay cool that worked hey there
it is I can i connect to Windows Update
well you can try but you're not gonna
get a chance because we actually don't
have network drivers is a Seuss's site
this still live well alright its life
okay how about that oh thank you oh no
no I don't want to know I don't want to
download updates for search breath what
no this computer will no longer receive
blah blah blah uh uh Wow let's try it it
stalls team like this team even still
worked for Windows XP Nvidia your
website just doesn't even run on this
alright we'll grab the latest driver I
wonder what year it was 2013 hey that's
not that bad oh we seem to have hit a
bit of a stumbling block that really
does sort of bring to light an issue
with always-online DRM solutions like
any game that I bought on Steam in the
Windows XP days what I just can't play
it what if I couldn't upgrade my
computer what if it was an old game that
doesn't run on Windows 10 so what are we
gonna do for games like I have a couple
here that are just on the server alright
so what you want this is a doom 3 trial
sure yeah
ok so here it is we're gonna find out
for real running the doom 3 demo if this
rig is fully functional and we're ready
to move on to making our ultimate ricer
PC Oh what ultra quality was 1024 by
sunset I forgot how brutal this game was
on hardware back then oh ok really ok I
guess we're sticking with high quality
it looks really dark yeah that was sort
of an issue with this game yeah so
that's it I'm a little disappointed in
the performance I don't know why I would
have been expecting anything else but
like it does the trick guys let us know
in the comments if you have any
suggestions for particular things you'd
like to see us do with the rig but stay
tuned because sometime and I think the
next couple of months this is going to
undergo a complete transformation
speaking of complete transformations
Tinh is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction and with ting you pay only
for what you use
with the average ting bill coming in at
just $23 a month per device they have no
contracts and you can try it risk-free
and if you're stuck in a contract with
your existing carrier and you switch to
ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75
they've got nationwide coverage from
coast to coast in the USA and data is
now just $10 a gig beyond the second gig
they never block throttle or interfere
with your online access and you can find
out how much you'll save on ting by
going to Linus ting comm and trying out
their savings calculator we used their
voicemail to text service and published
our number one eight three three five
six five Elsie TVM to hear some messages
from our fans I unfortunately don't have
access to think here in the UK but I
would love to get it would save me
roughly around about ten pounds if you
were to convert it so I really hope
you're able to click over here it could
be UK so lower your phone bill Atlanta
staying calm and get twenty five dollars
in ten credit will have that linked
below so thanks for watching guys if you
disliked this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description I
think the only current things are this
power supply in this case also down
there's our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
