that is more exciting
due to what it represents in the future
than it is necessarily for its
practicality today for gamers this is
the magma express box 3 t-this is quite
simply a thunderbolt external enclosure
that has two PCIe 8 X and one PCIe 4x
slots inside of it it has a 250 watt
power supply and it is capable of
installing pretty much anything that you
would normally install in a PCI Express
slot inside your computer so right now
driver support is a bit of a challenge
it comes with a carrying case so you can
take it around with you on the road
think of this guy's laptops that you can
install up to three full size PCI
Express expansion cards in essentially
ok just mind-blown right
ok so comes with a blower that you can
install if you have something like a
Quadro graphics card that you want to
use to accelerate cuda applications
although right now you can't use it as a
display output yet and that's mostly
supported on on Apple at the time or at
this time here so it's a quick start
guide I've actually already opened this
and I've already tinkered with it a fair
bit so that's why there's like PCI slot
covers in here because I've already
installed cards in it but right so what
makes it more useful in the future than
it is today because for general
consumers you're going to find that
hardware compatibility is a bit of a
challenge with not just this one but
with all of the Thunderbolt PCI Express
expansion expansion bays that you can
obtain so here it is it's crafted out
it's very beautiful I mean it's very
Apple esque the way that it's
constructed it's got a nice matte
aluminum finish over the whole thing
with a simple magma logo on both sides
it's got a perforated front to the
enclosure that has a power indicator
it's a button but generally speaking you
won't even use it because it's
automatically activated as soon as a fun
durable
connection is detected and the computer
is booted up so you can just leave it
plugged in and leave it on all the time
and it'll automatically turn itself on
and off with your computer should you
desire that there's also a cooling fan
behind here it's an 80 mil cooling fan
so you can install power-hungry things
like graphics cards to go along with
that 250 watt power supply the bottom
again is quite simple you've just got
four rubber feet so that it doesn't go
anywhere and once you load this thing up
with expensive hardware you're going to
want it to not really go anywhere so
I've got three cards in here right now
one of them is an Asus zonar dense it's
a Zen sound card so this is for the
split out for more analogue connectors
I've also got a black magic capture card
that's an HDMI capture card as an
intensity Pro and last but not least I
have some random LSI raid card that I
decided to throw in here and see what
happened I tried a number of graphics
cards
it looks like the challenge right now is
that the graphics card manufacturers
need to release drivers that will
support running over thunderbolt so that
thunderbolt connection is 10 gigabit per
second and you can daisy-chain this
device for multiple express boxes or
storage devices or whatever else
remember thunderbolt daisy chains up to
six times and that gives you enough
bandwidth these are all pcie 2.0 ports
so it has there you go to a tech slots
and a 4x slot with one of those ATX
slots having an open back so you can
install a 16 X card so I tried a bunch
of different graphics cards geforce
cards Radeon cards
I even had a Quadro 6000 that I put in
but unfortunately on the Windows
platform I wasn't able to leverage that
but out of the cards that are in here
the Blackmagic intensity Pro worked
flawlessly so if you wanted to say for
example have a portable capture station
so you had like a nice powerful Ivy
Bridge laptop with a Thunderbolt port
and you wanted to carry one of these
guys around with you with it I mean it
wouldn't consume much power in that
configuration so you have a small UPS or
something battery backup that you run it
off of you could actually do multiple
camera captures all at the same time do
live to tape recording on set somewhere
so that's fascinating you could install
three of those cards capture up to three
sources at the same time very cool stuff
power is provided by two molex
connectors so you can adapt those to PCI
Express if you were running a Mac which
apparently runs completely driverless
you just throw the Quadro 6000 in there
you plug in the power so use a PCIe
adapter and you install it right there
so you get two of those and a 250 watt
power supply as I mentioned before the
raid card didn't really get detected and
the Zoners ence works it works but the
asus control panel wouldn't install so
what i've encountered is everything from
stuff that doesn't get detected at all
to stuff that detects and works
perfectly like the Blackmagic I even
captured video to stuff that works but
doesn't quite work so we're almost there
this is extremely exciting technology
because what I am waiting for because I
like notebooks I like portability but I
hate how gutless notebook graphics are
and how horrible generally speaking
notebook on board sound is how limited
the expansion options are now all of a
sudden through the magic of Thunderbolt
you could just sit down at your desk at
home plug in your notebook one cable hot
pluggable have a graphics card a beast
sound card and like an awesome external
rate like raid card that runs off to
like some storage array or something
like that and the whole thing could run
off your notebook you disconnect it you
go on the road and you're ready to go so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the magma express box
3 T I am so excited for the future of
devices like this right now they're also
quite expensive don't forget to
