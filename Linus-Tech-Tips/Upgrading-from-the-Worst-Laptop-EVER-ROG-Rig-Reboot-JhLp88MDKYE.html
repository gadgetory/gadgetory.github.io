many challengers approached only three
we're successful in this is one of them
Charlie say hi hi hi Internet hi mom hi
dad
no no your dad's over there so Charlie
Hales to us from where you from man
Florida Oh oh wow
so you were right in the heart of it
yeah so you have power to go plug this
into right well we have powers not my
finest Wow all right well that's pretty
lucky man well everybody you know safe
and cool yes rock on glad to hear that
okay
so today we're gonna be building a
rocking machine have you ever built a
computer before no no this is your first
time yeah well today that changes
welcome to the party let's get started
the asus rog Strix 1080 TI comes with
asus GPU tweak - which allows you to
monitor performance and helps you stream
it also features their game booster as
well as a free one-year premium license
of xsplit gamecaster learn more at the
link in the video description so what do
you want to start with motherboard good
choice so even though you've never built
a computer before have you watched a
build guide yeah a lot of them Alwine is
tech tips guides right
no have you at least watched a Linus
tech tips guide yeah I make a very
minimal oh wow so that's the kind of
video we're making
all right shots fired shots hit the
target let's all just wipe out party
faceny continue oh holy crap Corsair
yeah your system at home you were the
one with the laptop right yeah Super
Bowl and laptop that's great for gaming
no no not so much hey my computer is an
HP laptop it's a my little laptop and
then right next to it I got my little
$25 mouse I don't actually know what
brand my mouse is I kind of got it cuz
it wasn't really expensive pretty much
you know really you had like a Pentium
core with HD into integrated graphics
and tell me something HD Intel graphics
how high definition are they 720p is
good yeah that's what they'd like you to
think okay have you ever installed the
CPU before no all right even touched one
okay so here not yet
okay you can touch it no just kidding
okay you can touch it
yeah all right so you want to line that
up real carefully there's no force
required so all you get to do hang out
that was it all right push em down lower
the arm down you have officially
installed the CPU
okay have you done ran before I mean I
took grandmother's like a computer
fantastic
alright let's do it why am I even here
cuz I don't know everything
I memorized how do you do the
motherboard and that's pretty much where
it is haha so tell me then charlie what
was your plan if somebody ever did give
you a computer worth of parts you were
just gonna assemble the motherboard and
kind of I just go on youtube and watch a
guide and filled it with that you've got
all the answer kids today man so tell me
something Charlie what's gonna be the
first thing you do when the system
arrives at home message the RGB and then
I'm gonna go to the steam floor and buy
a games really good graphics so that I
can see those I'm just gonna end up
eating for the sake of thoroughness we
could pull the board out we could
relocate this standoff we could put it
there
mmm here's a Tim Boetsch work wait stop
we missed something really important oh
no you didn't do the satisfying plastic
peel off the RAM enjoy this I only get
to do it once
oh yes look how shiny it is now we also
have to figure out where our hard drive
is gonna go because this hard drive cage
can you say who's good up here I did say
that but let me tell you something about
adults charlie sometimes well they don't
lie but they say things without having
really thought them through or kids your
age allowed to use knives yeah yeah okay
don't decide I don't know
mine are like 5 and 3 so huge TV all
right now leave these fans because I
have something better
RGB fans it's gonna be lit that's what
the kids say right yeah when that RGB
lighting is giving you an extra 15
frames per second you'll thank me
I tell you man it is so easy to build a
computer these days and like have it
look awesome current to a thousand years
ago I can imagine it was hard since
thousand years ago to go to computer you
sure your name is Charlie yeah sure it's
not Alec oh I'm gonna confess something
to you Charlie mister I know so how come
you picked an AMD build cuz I like to
rosenbear plus it feels like to actually
care about prices even when he's not
paying for it he's going for the
perception of who's treating the
customer more fairly so you said this
machine is for gaming at school so
surely 480 gigs on your boot drive is
not enough for the library you want okay
well that's fine we've got you covered
2 terabyte drive then you got to make a
big decision here possibly the most
important decision of the entire build
do you want to put it on the bottom or
the top is there really a difference no
hey there's two on the other side then
we need that SATA data cable that we set
aside much much earlier and then
misplaced and then found go for it open
it up enjoy it savor it so I ripped it
those are all the good vibes oh I ripped
it again see I used to wonder why people
watch unboxing videos then I watched an
amateur open a box totally get it now
oh there's cool on top yeah it's a cool
logo this isn't just any oh yeah this is
a Strix 1080 TI Wow there it is that's
what's gonna run all your Minecraft and
there are Neopets believe it or not it
works as cool as
looks if you were to run cheapo games
like Minecraft on it believe it or not
these fans these fans wouldn't even have
to spin Wow because the heatsink on it
is so big this thing has like the entire
thing basically covered in aluminum fins
okay now the most important part of
installing the graphics card I'm not
dropping it okay okay the next most
important oh yes it's got a typo on it I
think
hey really look at this GT X 1080 TI
gaming it's kind of embarrassed it's not
gaming it's like it's like gaming yo so
line up your ports at the back hey you
can tell if these are yep you're good
did it I just autograph this card sure
did
and you started with the best graphics
fine
now this is cool your graphics card
actually includes an RGB lighting header
so we can hook one of our RGB lighting
strips that we have from cable mod up to
it okay alright cover your eyes okay
just follow a follow us out of my voice
okay okay this is the time for the big
reveal
don't trip over that big block in front
of your foot no I'm just kidding there's
no block because I moved it turn to the
right and experience 180 Hertz gaming so
that is what high refresh rate with
g-sync looks like so however many frames
your GPU spits out that's exactly how
many frames get displayed here so you
don't see any tearing you don't see any
lag so you don't even have to give kids
these days a game they'll just play move
the window around if you throw it high
enough refresh rate monitor at them now
let me show you something else that's
really cool we're on this side that's
nice RGB yeah that's a nice RGB and and
we'll get the utility loaded up but
check this out see this RGB logo here
and the logo on the back of the graphics
card it's synchronized with the RGB
strip across the top here I got one
other cool thing for you to really
listen to it that's going that streaks
for you well family won't get annoyed at
all well I'm sure they'll find reasons
to get annoyed because you're always
gonna be on the computer or bugging them
to go on the computer the day was
awesome actually it was really cool the
bill was my hair part and then it was
also fun at the end to test the computer
and stuff I was definitely not expecting
a 1080i so while Charlie plays around
with the RGB settings on the video card
which also controls the RGB strip along
the top I guess I'll bid you guys
farewell thanks for watching this
episode of our ROG rig reboot huge
congratulations to you but for winning
this whole thing rate the system you go
tell me out of 10 10 10 out of 10
perfect like your style then alright
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
