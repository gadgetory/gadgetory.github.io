seven gamers one CPU machine which you
can check out here by the way that we do
an LTE edition bill block not
necessarily because that one wasn't
black and orange enough but because
thanks to its cost it wasn't really
attainable for well any but the richest
oil princes so today we are going to be
bringing it back down to earth somewhat
with other than the lightest Tecates
edition not to offends every other part
of this the first LTT edition bill being
an off-the-shelf normal component
so it begins as always with the
motherboard unfortunately within a
Seuss's lineup unless you're willing to
paint their rog series x99 board there's
not much choice for a premium option in
anything other than white or red so I
decided to go with their WS which is all
black
I've been partial to the ws line for
quite some time
I like the no frills feature set
excellent compatibility with exotic
adding cards and rock-solid construction
let's mention ECC compatibility if
you're into the whole Xeon thing for the
CPU speaking of which I went with a core
i7 59:30 k-6 core the only reason for
this is that with an x 99 motherboard
the 5820k provides 28 versus 40 PCI
Express Lanes
so it can limit future expansion but if
you don't see yourself adding a bunch of
specialized PCIe cards to your computer
the 6-4 5820k is a fantastic choice to
go along with my six core CPU I've got
four dens of quad-channel ddr4 memory
and it's not an LTE edition build
without Corsair dominators with the only
problem being again that while
dominators are actually available in
orange the orange really doesn't match
what I'm trying to do here and it only
comes on this weird special edition low
capacity high speed skew I wanted 32
gigs of ram with the ability to move to
64 gigs in the future so I ended up
painting the top bars of a regular kit
of dominators myself it's actually
really easy to do it takes about an hour
of total time if you've got a convenient
place to spray paint the heatsink may
actually seem like an odd choice to any
of you a single tower heatsink with a
push-pull fan configuration lines really
but the rationale is actually pretty
straightforward I opted for a single
Tower over a dual tower for better
compatibility with tall Ram coolers and
over an a IO liquid cooler because
rather than a
points of failure water cools remember
our rendered useless if either the pump
or the fan fails at our cooler improves
reliability because with two fans on it
it can operate at near peak efficiency
even if one of them fails thanks to not
to his use of a static pressure
optimized fan design which isn't to say
that I left the original fan on the
blackened orange is a special LTT
edition of the NFF 12 that's only
available while quantities last at the
pricing and discussion link in the video
description for the case I wanted
something off the shelf but something
that I also really liked and the H 440
continues to stand out as a well-built
well-thought-out case and they happened
to have an orange accented version right
around the time that I was evaluating my
options for this build
be quiet silent bass 800 was also a top
candidate but I did a silence optimized
building it over a year ago
and I wanted something a little
different for the power supply I have
actually originally intended to use
something much more sensible a Corsair
RM 850 X so still high quality but not
to the point where I'm paying a huge
premium for 80-plus titanium efficiency
or enough wattage to run literally three
of these systems under load
unfortunately I misplaced my orange and
black kit of course they're compatible
cable mod cables and was only able to
find by EVGA ones and I gotta have my
black and orange cables man I mean no
ltte edition build would be complete
without them so the EVGA T 1600 makes a
return from seven gamers one CPU for the
case fan I mean do I even need to say it
the obvious choice for an LTE build is
blue LED gate looms from NCIX that it
now I went of course for the exclusive
LT t orange version of nock to us and F
Series so I popped three of them in the
front choosing to go logo side up and
deal with the cable management later on
and in the rear I used an LC T addition
NF a 14 honestly I could have gotten
away with just the one in the back since
the front fans will be hidden by the
three and a half inch bays anyway but it
just didn't
all right I went for the 100% complete
versus just getting to the ending
cinematic at this point it was time to
mount the motherboard and I found a
small flaw in my plan I had to pull the
rubber grommets out of the case to avoid
flexing the slightly wider than standard
ATX board then I used some fan cable
extensions and splitters to reach the
fan headers on the motherboard rather
than the hub on the back of the middle
tray I know it's worth it so that I can
set up a custom fan curve that responds
to system temperature changes in the
BIOS versus relying on a manual switch
then I ran all the wiring for the
motherboard drive video card and fans
with the intention of hiding as much of
it as possible the aged 440 lends itself
very well to the clean look with its
hidden power supply basement thing the
second to last component was the SSD and
I regretted my decision here I mean sure
the HyperX savage is a fine SSD and 960
gigs in lots of capacity no issues there
but I regretted not finding a better way
to paint this one to go back and do it
again I think I'd want to mask off a
pattern on the top or something but
still once it was mounted it ended up
looking okay for the final stage I walk
for a while about whether to mount the
video card in the top slot the
traditional way or to move it down a
little bit for better function or
whatever and I ended up putting it a
couple slots down it looks so much
better there and doesn't impact
performance anyhow so we're done what is
until Linus tech tips releases its own
motherboard case video card ram SSD
power supply and cables actually as
close as you can get to a fully ltte
Edition build thank you guys for coming
along with the ride and thank you for
joining me now for the moment of truth
ah yes oh yeah a last-minute addition
that we added cable laud RGB LED strips
with magnetic mounting which by the way
makes a whole lot more sense to me than
this
sticky-tape mounting that most of the
Meuse so thanks again for watching guys
