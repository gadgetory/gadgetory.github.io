us some really interesting laptops this
year most of which have been laser
focused on providing crazy performance
in a size we haven't seen before
gigabyte had a bit of a different idea
sounds crazy but they were like what if
you could just use a power efficient
max-q GPU in like more like a regular
laptop for maximum awesomeness
well what you'd probably end up with is
the Aero 15 X also maximally awesome by
the way is today's sponsor Sennheiser

description
the arrow 15x has a clean professional
look to it that actually reminds me of
older Dell or Lenovo business models
except with a carbon-fiber accent on the
back and RGB lighting on the keyboard to
keep it from getting too boring and
corporate it also has almost no bezels
bordering the display and the feel of
the whole laptop is really solid save
for a slightly wobbly screen hinge at
just under 20 millimeters thick and 4.6
pounds it doesn't quite qualify as a
thin and light but for the power that it
houses I would definitely call it
portable it's rocking an Intel Core i7
quad core 16 gigs of ram and a gtx 1070
max-q
making it suitable for anything from
heavy gaming to light workstation use
that is assuming that it's adequately
cooled and adding to the portability is
the fact that the i/o includes full-size
USB 3/8 ernet and Thunderbolt 3 so
there's no need to carry around any
dongles if you don't want to back to
cooling though obviously that's going to
be a challenge for a device like the
Aero 15 X with only the CPU loaded we
experienced no throttling though and
temps in the mid 70s with that said with
a combined CPU and GPU load like
gigabytes compact bricks gaming desktop
the Aero 15 X's CPU throttled down
significantly it seems though like this
is something that they could fine tune
with a future BIOS or driver update
because under full load we could hardly
even hear the fans gaming performance is
really strong though a max-q 1070 isn't
quite as fast as a desktop 1070 but in
this machine actually ends up within
spitting distance and given how slim it
is I'm willing to forgive it a couple of
frames here and there besides on its 60
Hertz display it won't be making much of
a difference anyway
which I guess leads us perfectly into
our biggest beef with the Aero 15 X it
hurts me to say this but 60 refreshes
per second at 1080p
really isn't enough it's not a bad
display at all especially if you're into
the gaming workstation angle since its
x-ray color calibrated out of the box
and in my opinion 1080p while not as
crispy as 1440p or better isn't too bad
for the size but with this kind of CPU
and GPU performance we should easily be
running at a hundred fps or more in many
modern games and right now buyers of
this device aren't getting the full
experience unless they hook up an
external monitor and I've got other
issues as well the webcam placement you
either get a view up my nostrils or if
we adjust it you get to stare at my
right hand oh right you're down there so
when is like I don't know a magnetic
like clip-on mic or something with just
contacts in the top of the monitor
coming that would be sick no bezels no
privacy concerns and no viewing angle
compromise moving down from the webcam
though is lots of good news on the
keyboard there's a pleasant travel
distance and a solid feel to the keys
with a fairly high actuation force so
fans of Cherry MX blue switches will
probably really like this one I found it
awesome to type on some gamers might
find there's a little more force
required than they'd like I could see
your left pinky getting a bit tired but
overall really liked it and then going
lower still we've got a perfectly usable
though somewhat unremarkable trackpad it
does what it needs to do with solid
tracking and a clicky feel where the
arrow 15x really shines compared to
other gaming laptops especially compact
ones is the battery life with almost six
hours of unplugged productivity it is
among the best battery life we've ever
seen in any gaming laptop especially one
with this kind of performance and
opening it up which is pretty easy if
you have the right bit reveals how
exactly gigabyte achieved this feat it's
beautiful manufacturers or at least
gigabyte anyway are finally listening to
me that
is a ninety four point two four watt
hour battery that is right near the
legal limit for what you can take on a
plane with you and I might cry a little
here because it's also got sockets for
adding more em to storage and upgrading
your RAM instead of soldered solutions
for either of those so that's all fine
and good but like all the other max-q
laptops we've seen it comes at a cost
literally this version here will run you
twenty two hundred dollars which means
if your wallet is tight and your
backpack is large you can get more
performance for less but while the Aero
15x doesn't give you the best bang for
the buck and really it doesn't excel at
any specific task it also isn't the
worst performance per dollar or for that
matter it's not the worst at anything
nothing else that i've seen yet gives
you everything that it does all in one
place portability productivity and
gaming highly recommended
great work gigabyte need to see a 120
Hertz display with g-sync next time
