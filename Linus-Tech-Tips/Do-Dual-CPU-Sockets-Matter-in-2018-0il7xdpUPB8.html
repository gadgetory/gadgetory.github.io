both called Zeon but these things are
really different one of them is
basically a core i9 with ECC memory
support and the other one is a server
CPU that I fangirled all because I love
super high-end expensive tech toys now
in the past you needed multiple CPUs in
one multi socketed motherboard in order
to handle intensive multi-threaded
workloads but is that still the case
today do you still need two of these
given that a single xeon Platinum 8180
is twenty eight cores and fifty-six
threads on a single chip well I don't
know what is the purpose today of a dual
socket machine like this one and how
much have single hike or count CPUs
eroded the market that they used to
enjoy let's find out shall we
after I tell you about today's sponsor
Mac Weldon Mac Weldon makes great
underwear t-shirts socks wallets and
more they believe in simple shopping and
if you use code tech tips you will get
20% off at the link below
all right there's a lot more room down
here and we are gonna need it for this
honking not to mention heavy test bench
on this test bench you will find the
Asus c6 21 sage this is a dual socket
motherboard rocking to LGA 3647 sockets
for Intel's Xeon scalable lineup of CPUs
and setups like this have actually been
around as far back as the 486 in 1989
with the resulting second-hand Hardware
giving enthusiasts the ability to get
multiple physical cores in their homes
over the years with the peak being
somewhere in the mid 2000s or so but
that was then and this is now now you
can get multiple processing cores in a
single chip so to see how far things
have come what we're gonna do is pit
this machine against the fastest single
CPU that we've tested today we're gonna
try to keep the number of variables to a
minimum in order to gauge the impact
that these extra CPU cores will have on
our setup though it should be noted that
there aren't many options when it comes
to aftermarket LGA 3647 coolers because
most of the folks selling these kinds of
systems would figure out their own
solution so that means that our dual
socket workstation will run a little bit
toasty but we didn't observe any thermal
throttling so it shouldn't affect our
performance let's start off then with
good old-fashioned Cinebench I mean
we've we've seen this run before but
it's always fun to see it finish that
quickly oh so in a surprise to no one
the dual socket machine is faster but
considering it's 50
six processing course not all of our
workloads scale in the way that we might
expect 7-zip for example shows a smaller
than expected gain over our core i9
Extreme Edition and why cruncher even
finds itself losing ground Asus real
bench demonstrates this though with that
said the encoding benchmark eats out a
lead over our core i9 79 80 XC and then
blender well here we actually get a
victory for our dual CPU system again
showing this platform's potential for
expanding render farms but what is
really going on here
well something you guys have to realize
is that there is more to a dual socket
configuration than just more cores do
you remember when AMD managed a three
percent improvement in IPC with second
gen Rison just by improving cache
latency so on this motherboard we've got
two separate CPUs with two separate sets
of cache and memory see these six banks
go to this one and these six banks are
wired into this one and that means a lot
of latency for compute tasks that
require the same data sets this latency
is a necessary evil in the design of
multiprocessor systems because of the
need for non-uniform memory access or
Numa for short that allows these two
processors to efficiently share
resources or as efficiently as they can
so the short version of this is that it
works by transparently allocating
devices and memory to each CPU which
means they can more easily avoid
interrupting each other while accessing
those resources this in turn reduces the
amount of waiting around that they have
to do for those resources to become
available so that's what we're seeing
during our testing like in Y cruncher
for example where both
us are working on the same data but it's
not really the intended use case for
this kind of thing what if we could use
different data sets then we should be
able to find this kind of setups true
calling and how better to do that than
to effectively turn this system into two
independent computing machines using
virtualization so let's fire up on raid
which uses Red Hat kvn as a hypervisor
to see what kind of results we get
splitting these resources into multiple
independent machines immediately we see
worse results from our VMs than our
original 56 core testing but look
closely at how much lower it is it's not
a whole lot in every test it's basically
the same story here and we are still way
out ahead of the core i9 Extreme Edition
particularly when it comes to blender
now if we consider the fact that we are
getting simultaneous work done that
gives us a good look at what an
optimized workload might look like I
mean or heck virtualization itself is a
legitimate task to I mean this thing
could be so many gamers in one PC but I
digress I mean nobody is gonna buy
something like this for their personal
rig anytime soon given the $10,000 per
CPU price tag which puts it squarely in
the territory of big the size of the
check doesn't matter business what they
care about is density the more
processing power a single computer can
manage the more processing power that
can be physically fit into a building
and this is perhaps most important for
data centers and render farms in
particular the less those guys have to
spend on setting up the electricity and
cool
management for a data center versus the
amount of performance they can get the
better so will multiple sockets make a
comeback in the prosumer space outside
of you know oil and gas exploration
where there are still workloads that can
benefit from this kind of thing the
chances look pretty slim if you ask me
but I don't necessarily think that it's
Intel's intent to sell these chips in
the prosumer space and for that matter
even in the enterprise space I don't
think they move a ton of them
for me I look at a product like this as
more of like a future crafting exercise
where it is available today but it's
more of a representation of what
actually might be attainable a
generation or two from now just like the
22 core processors that we were playing
around with a couple of years ago
nowadays those are much more affordable
and businesses are using them to power
your cloud computing services it's
making of services Dollar Shave Club is
the service that has all of your
grooming needs taken care of
they've got toothpaste body wash hair
styling products everything you need to
look feel and smell your best and
they're basically giving away their
daily essential starter set to new
members for just 5 bucks in the first
box you'll get their shave butter their
body wash and their one wipe Charlies
butt wipes and you'll also receive their
executive razor which includes their
premium weighty handle and a full
cassette of cartridges after the first
box replacement cartridges are sent to
you for just a few bucks a month so
check it out today at Dollar Shave Club
