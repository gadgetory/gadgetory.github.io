challenging to find a place to hang out
that actually caters to the activities
and environments that were into we want
to be comfortable we want to have stuff
to eat and drink we want to have
activities like games or other nerdy
things that we could do some privacy
options and some shops would also be a
nice add-on so enter Bellevue
Washington's mocks boardinghouse
mass drop is featuring the godspeed
custom si key cap set inspired by the
colorway of the original Apollo 11 lunar
module cockpit click the link below to
learn more immediately upon entering the
main door you're welcomed into the
inviting environment of the dining hall
with a menu mainly comprised of comfort
food items and a wide selection of
drafts and other alcoholic concoctions
you should be good to go in the
sustenance department but as you may
have noticed the tables are huge that's
because they want you to welp play games
as it says on my menu and not computer
games board games so when you play board
games and they're happy to provide them
everything from risk and Catan to
Scrabble or a fellow basically whatever
you want
now if the hustle and flow of the public
area is too much for you in your group
you're also welcome to book one of the
three private rooms first up is the
apakah fairy with a dark and evil
laboratory type of aesthetic up on the
wall you have vials of poisons and other
various ingredients and above your main
table are some really wicked looking
Edison bulbs then we have the more
mystical library which features a huge
amount of actually real books from a law
library just a kind of fun little tidbit
each of these rooms are $40 an hour not
too bad considering they can hold 12
people or by lifting this door 24 moving
on however is the coolest damn thing
here the third private room and it is
well right through here this is the
speakeasy and at $80 an hour it isn't
cheap but makes up for it in sheer level
of badassery a private bar with a
private waiter an occupancy of 25 people
and honestly easily one of the coolest
aesthetics of a private area I have ever
seen but you're more here for the games
right well they've got you covered with
a massive board game shop of the
ginormous selection sometime last year I
was here and actually ended up buying
the Civilization games with Barney
Cleese and a very nice offering from
Timmy tech TV and they also have a magic
card shop with over a hundred
thousand cards in inventory right now
and they'll buy yours too for value in
cash straight up or in-store credit plus
30% that can be used anywhere including
the restaurants you can turn your magic
cards directly into beer then they have
a warhammer and other large format
tabletop games area featuring these
beautiful geeks cheat tables the likes
of which you can see in this video of
some of our previous pax coverage and
you can even express your hobby in other
ways with a huge selection of paints and
other various painting accessories you
can make your stuff look awesome I would
completely fail at this but there's also
probably people here that you can give a
little bit of cash to to do it for you
and finally the main event the
gargantuan card game focused tabletop
area with even a castable table
featuring a bunch of cameras and TVs
above it set on Fridays they can stream
their big games playing games eating
food competing in tournaments and
consuming drinks mocks boarding house is
my kind of place but is it yours I know
there wasn't really any computer stuff
