NAB 2017 coverage learn more about the
Mk II two elements gopro microphone and

the link in the video description coming
hot off the heels of Dells announcement
of their 8k monitor at CES 2017 Dell has
revealed their very first HDR monitor
the U P 27:18 Q and HDR 10 standard
monitor that seems to be well spec to
meet the needs of many creative
professionals wanting a color accurate
monitor that has HDR capabilities the U
P 27:18 Q sports a fairly standard
layout of IO with two HDMI ports one
full size DisplayPort one mini
DisplayPort and two USB ports for the 4
USB 3 ports strategically placed around
the monitor the U P 27:18 Q has a peak
brightness of a thousand nits fitting
within the requirements for HDR 10 as
well as a wide range in its colour
spectrum and as a 10 bit panel with 100%
Adobe RGB and srgb coverage 100% rec.709
97.7% of DCI p3 and 77% of rec 2020 each
monitor will come factory calibrated so
there will be minimal fuss out of the
box
however the luck for the monitor can
also be changed to better suit your
personal needs through Dells software so
for those of you who are working
together in large teams on say a film or
large print project each monitor can be
guaranteed to be running the same color
settings workstation to workstation
ensuring consistency across multiple
users adding to that you can also
conveniently use something like the I 1
display Pro to fill in some of the
parameters that would usually require
manual calibration making the entire
process a little bit easier Dell teams
to be checking all the boxes necessary
for those of us who want to start diving
into HDR workflows though it is still
very early days for HDR s adoption and
even the folks at Dells booth admit that
HDR is a standard regarding official GPU
support is currently a tad bewildering
we can only hope the HDR adoption
becomes a little bit easier to
understand as time goes on so thank you
guys for watching let me know what you
think of Dells crack at their first HDR
monitor in the comments down below and
thanks again for Sennheiser for
sponsoring our coverage of nab 2017
