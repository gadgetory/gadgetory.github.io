adventures part 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
you've got your dank mining rig and an
ASIC or 2 and you are well on your way
to becoming crypto rich but how do you
keep those sweet bitcoins and alt coins
safe and for that matter if you're not
necessarily into buying a bunch of
hardware how do you just speculate on
the coins buying and selling them let's
find out but first let's tell you guys
about ek water blocks ek SMLC Phoenix
lineup is designed around quick
disconnect couplings and brings a
modular approach to connecting and
expanding your loop learn more at the
link below
so if you've already been mining you're
likely withdrawing your rewards to an
exchange be it G Dax crackin finance or
any of the other few hundred exchanges
out there or you might be using a wallet
on your PC
now most casuals will probably stick
with the former because being able to
sell without moving your funds from your
local wallet to an exchange can actually
save both time and money in transfer
fees however there are some serious
drawbacks to this approach first and
most importantly you are not in control
of your private keys what's the private
key ah I thought you'd never ask
ok so I'm gonna use Bitcoin as an
example in layman's terms a Bitcoin
address that string of numbers and
letters is kind of like a see-through
donation container at the local
McDonald's there's a slot in the top so
anyone can see how much is in it and
anyone who knows the address can put
money in but if somebody wanted to get
money out like to transfer funds to a
friend or to buy something they would
need the private key to open up the box
signing the transaction now there are a
couple of exceptions to this
for example Manero makes use of ring
signatures to hide balances and
transaction amounts but most crypto
currencies are fundamentally similar in
this way so then when your funds are in
a wallet on your PC the private keys are
owned and can be encrypted by you so if
there is a fork a duplication of the
existing blockchain with whatever new
and different features that the
duplicator may desire you can export
your private keys and then import them
into the Forks wallet to get access to
the duplicated funds if your funds are
on an exchange however support for Forks
is completely up to them because they're
in control of the private keys so let's
look at Bitcoin gold as an example of
why this matters
many exchanges chose to not support this
fork outright so many people missed out
on what was essentially free Bitcoin
gold because they were not holding their
own private keys at the time of the fork
huh now either of those approaches
though even with those drawbacks is
probably fine for casual miners who
aren't holding more than a couple
hundred dollars worth that is as long as
they can afford to lose what they have
more on this later for larger scale
miners and investors though something
called a cold wallet is basically an
essential tool now to be cold a wallet
cannot have an active network connection
this makes it nearly impossible to hack
now some people will just use a network
gapped computer so it's unplugged with
no Wi-Fi with normal software wallets
and then a system of either webcams and
QR codes or thumb drives to complete
their transactions but this method can
be kind of a hassle so many people with
large crypto holdings are using what's
called a hardware wallet these come in
the form of little devices with physical
security prompts like the ledger NAT OS
or treasurer once this device is plugged
into a PC you enter a PIN code open up a
companion app and then you go about your
business now it should be noted that
even the methods that we just outlined
do carry some risk but if you think
about it so does putting money in a bank
so you know your your PC's Drive could
die you could lose your hardware wallet
or in both cases you could forget your
password but as long as you backup your
wallet and you keep your backup codes
somewhere safe a safety deposit box in a
bank is a pretty good bet you should be
ok alright then so now that your Kryptos
are safe let's talk about buying and
selling though I really need to preface
this with a quick warning we are not
endorsing any of the exchanges that I'm
about to mention and I personally would
know
I recommend buying cryptocurrency unless
you know what you're doing and you are
comfortable losing literally all of the
money you spent like literally like this
gone all right there is a very public
history of exchanges disappearing
overnight or being hacked and losing
anywhere from a lot to all of their
users money so be safe with that out of
the way there are a ton of exchanges out
there let's look at one of the most
mainstream ones coinbase
it's fairly limited in features but
should work pretty well for casual
buyers the process is pretty simple just
hook up your bank account debit card or
PayPal account and you are free to buy
and sell cryptocurrency up to your limit
and you can raise your limits by doing
additional verification with the
exchange but this simplicity comes at
the cost of pretty high fees nearly 4%
for debit and credit transactions and I
should also point out that coin base has
a history of freezing trading during
high traffic times so take that as you
will some of the more Pro oriented
exchanges will charge a small fixed fee
of a few dollars for bank transfers in
and out and then cryptocurrency transfer
fees are typically dependent on that
currencies specific network fees so
Bitcoin will likely have a fee of a few
dollars while something like Zee cash
will have almost no fee at all these
exchanges like finance G Dax bit recs
Polonia X crypto Pia and BitFenix also
have crypto - crypto trading pairs so
you can actually take your Bitcoin and
then turn that into litecoin without
having to first go to a fiat currency
this helps you save some fees and is
pretty snazzy now if you're not super
concerned with getting the best possible
rate a market trade can be a pretty easy
way to go you just pick how much you
want to buy or sell and then the trade
will transact at the current market rate
just remember that especially for a very
large amounts
that rate can actually change literally
as your transactions are going through
so you might end up paying more or
getting less than you initially expected
now limit trades these allow you to set
the price point that you want your trade
to execute at meaning that you may
actually be able to get a slightly
better rate or if things go the other
way you might end up with nothing going
through at all some exchanges allow
what's called margin trading in this
situation you can auto magically borrow
money from the exchange to leverage your
bet based on a multiplier so let's say
you wanted to margin trade a thousand
dollars with a leverage of two to one
you would essentially be trading a
thousand dollars plus another thousand
dollars borrowed from the exchange and
then you would be charged interest on it
in most cases and the benefit is that
you could double your profit or the
drawback is that you could still lose
all that money and still need to pay the
stuff that you borrowed back so unless
you're a seasoned gather excuse me
trader we would recommend staying away
from margin trading in conclusion
trading can be a fun way to play around
with some disposable income but again I
think I've said this before but I would
caution against using any money that
could seriously negatively impact your
life if you were to lose it so be safe
and probably don't buy any
so yeah I fix it then you know those
guys really like to take stuff apart and
teach people how to fix things they are
leading the charge in the electronics
repair tools industry with their iconic
black and blue Pro tech toolkit and it's
only 60 bucks it's got tons of great
features the tool roll that makes it
compact and easy to store there's 64 bit
driver kit their wide variety of plastic
opening tools sputters and picks
not to mention suction cups with the new
fancy handle to help remove display
assemblies they've got all kinds of
stuff the Jimmy pry tool the ESD safe
tweezers and all iFixit tools are backed
by I fix its lifetime warranty so why
pay someone often more than $60 to fix
something for you when you can make a
one-time investment in a fully loaded
Pro Tech tool kit over at I fix it comm
slash Linus and fix your stuff forever
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it's awesome get subscribe hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description except don't buy the stuff
we featured unless you can afford to
lose that money yeah
also linked in the description is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join I think and
iFixit kits probably a better investment
than cryptocurrency all you have to do
is like a few device repairs for people
and you'll get that investment right
back several times over
where'd that money go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
