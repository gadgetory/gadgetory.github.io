computers are when you do something like
take a bunch of broken computers apart
and turn them into two or maybe one even
zombie computers that function quite
well or when I take something that
someone has officially declared as
broken and make it awesome
by either using it for something else or
fixing it myself
sure six to thirty thousand dollar
computers are farn and when someone goes
out and spends like two grand just on
water cooling their bill log will look
downright beautiful and props to them
I'm sure their rig looks great but the
build logs that will always grab my
attention are the scratch builds and the
builds work so what didn't have buckets
of cash but they made something unique
and awesome that's what I'm gonna try to
do today
until skull Canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more in the link of
the video description down below I
generally find that off-the-shelf test
benches are lousy sacrificed
functionality for looks not useful for
what you actually want to test hardware
or they cost way too much we like our
high speed PC taxations but there's
still 70 to 120 US dollars for these
ones a lot of money for essentially some
admittedly static resistant plastic and
a few screws even just buying a
motherboard tray in order to DIY
yourself a test bench isn't that cheap
and then you don't really have great
options in terms of component placement
for drives power supply and more 7s a
buddy of mine and prolific twitch
streamer of much lolz and many funds was
recently looking for a test bench of his
own and I couldn't recommend him
anything that I truly believed was a
good deal I even tweeted out to the
community asking what test benches they
thought were a good deal and the
response was to that question was a
resounding cardboard box that's lame and
sad and I want one that I can put drives
on I want one that I can actually mount
my motherboard to I want one that can
securely hold my expansion in graphics
cards I want one to cost next to nothing
or be free I want one to be
unapologetically made out of scrap
materials
so jokes about apples marketing efforts
aside let's begin first thing you need
is a donor case all it needs is an
intact motherboard and i/o tray and an
intact left or right side panel without
a window this is a spare case from
scrapyard Wars that we have no use for
and got for free it's best to tear down
the case as cleanly as possible and with
consideration for how the various metal
scraps can be repurposed things like
mesh could be used for radiator or fan
covers or something so don't just go ham
and risk ruining something that could
enhance your final test bench begin by
removing all the screws you can first
and take out anything they were holding
in then whip out the drill or a punch
and start removing rivets very few cases
are made entirely with screws these days
and those that are will probably be way
too nice to be repurposed this way so
expect to be removing a relatively large
number of rivets when you get up to the
front put aside the front ports activity
LEDs and set of power and reset switches
or even Diagnostics speaker if your case
happens to have one these can be used to
trick out your test bench or even just
store it away for future builds once
you've mostly stripped down the case
leaving the motherboard tray intact and
as a note here be careful because this
required leaving a couple rivets in for
me then it's time to whip out the
spinning wheel of death also known as
the the angle grinder there are a number
of ways you could do this but personally
I think this one worked out quite well
and sparks are cool decide at this point
how much of the motherboard tray you
want it's a good idea to leave in cool
stuff like attached hard drive mounting
holes but your case might be extended
ATX when you only need an ATX test bench
or you don't want those mounting holes
because just want to put your drives on
the bottom whatever it is this part is a
judgement call I decided to leave the
power supply mount up top for
convenience then I decided to axe
everything else
Sharpedo off my cut lines and got to
work doing this took some time but not
that much having a buddy to help you
would be great in terms of holding
things in the right places while you're
trying to cut through stuff so it
doesn't fall or bend or whatever safety
first wear your protective
goggles and gloves when working with
metal there's probably a few other
things that you should do that I didn't
so do those as well we did the cutting
with this angle grinder but I'd also
highly recommend having a sharp metal
file on hand in order to clean up your
edges of your test bench so that it's
actually safe for work and it isn't
going to cut your hand up whenever you
try to move it around because stuff like
angle grinders can leave really rough
edges next up you need to cut up the
side panel you chose earlier in order to
make it more or less match the
dimensions of your motherboard tray this
is pretty much the same procedure we did
previously I just put the part that I
just cut out on top of the side panel
Sharpie to round it then cut it up next
up I grabbed some spare two-by-four
chunks from our wood scraps bin and made
a set of legs and a set of feet I
drilled pilot holes and countersunk them
as well in order to make the feet flush
against the surface of the table and
then just screwed everything together
this resulted in a virtually free test
bench that I was able to construct in
under two hours that is sturdy durable
and very easy to mod due to its thin
metal and wood materials you can improve
upon it by spending like ten bucks on
some nylon motherboard mounting hardware
from something like mcmaster-carr
painting it installing additional
amounts for radiators drives etc adding
switches USB ports those things that you
harvest earlier and more it's your
platform and it was free do whatever you
want so this one's mine and I'm kind of
a functionality first kind of guy so
other than maybe a few switches this is
probably its final form so to speak but
if you guys decide to make one of these
scratch test benches on your own please
post on the forum the thread that's
linked in the video description down
below that would be awesome
I would love to see it I just love that
kind of stuff doesn't it seem like
they've got a subscription service for
pretty much everything at this point I
mean blue apron why would you need a
monthly supply of fresh blue aprons
well you don't because that would be
stupid what blue apron actually is is a
way to create delicious chef designed
recipes at home they deliver not aprons
farm-fresh ingredients everything you
need right to your doorstep in exactly
the right proportions there's
trip to the grocery store no extra
rotting food left in your fridge because
when else were you going to use you know
the six cloves of garlic that you had to
buy because you just needed one and they
offer a couple of different plans
there's the two-person plan and the
family plan recipes are delivered in a
refrigerated box of the ingredients will
stay fresh even if you're not at home
when your package arrives and they offer
a large selection of recipes and they're
always adding new dishes to the menu
every week there is no commitment you
can skip or cancel the service at any
time and each menu is between 500 to 700
calories per person all the meals can be
prepared in 40 minutes or less which if
you do the numbers is less than the
amount of time it takes to go to a
restaurant and come back you might as
well make something better for yourself
and it gives you an opportunity to
practice your cooking skills and learn
to make new recipes is available in the
USA and again it's at the link in the
video description and if you loved this
kind of stuff like the video get
subscribed if you hated it because
you're like don't use cases for
interesting things don't make things for
free screw you you can dislike the video
that's fair if you like our stuff in
general you can use our Amazon affiliate
code to shop at Amazon buy a cool
t-shirt like this one at the link video
description below join the forum
possibly become a forum contributor and
check out this video what video is that
ah no - OH - review there we go just
thought of one brand is laughing in the
background
don't know what that's about go check
out that video that'll make Brandon
laugh the more times you watch that
video Brandon will laugh more 100% no
