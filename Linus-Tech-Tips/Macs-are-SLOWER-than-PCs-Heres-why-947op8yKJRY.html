are just so much more expensive than a
PC but as we've demonstrated a handful
of times in the past in many cases it's
actually just as expensive to custom
build a PC with the same specs and
features as a given Mac the problem
though is that Mac's often don't perform
as you would expect given their
specifications so today's video is a
deep dive into what's going on and why
powerful yet small computer upgrade King
gaming desktops feature exceptional
cooling for near limitless specs like 32
core thread ripper or 18 core Extreme
Edition CPUs with RT X xx atti graphics
check them out at the link below
now as you probably already know Apple
designs their own computers and when I
say designs
I mean designs they're slim they're
lightweight and they've got specs that
make your eyes light up and go ooh but
in the pursuit of sex appeal they often
don't do those sometimes very impressive
specs justice the reason
thermals now this is a little bit
strange for reasons that we'll get into
more later but watch this I can fire up
quite literally any stress test
this is prime95 right here and within
moments I will have temperatures rapidly
approaching a hundred degrees the point
at which most Intel CPUs will throttle
back their clock speeds in order to
protect themselves from damage how can
they get away with this well apples done
a little bit of trickery here and
adjusted the voltage and fan curves in
Mac OS so that they can hit a higher
thermal threshold without throttling too
far below intel's advertised base clock
but even at room temperature it's on a
knife set and in boot camp those tweaks
gets thrown out the windows pun intended
which means the voltages are higher and
the threshold for throttling triggers
sooner making for a sluggish mess of an
experience overall this actually made
waves back when the 2018 MacBook Pro
launched because Apple accidentally
didn't have those tweaks enabled in Mac
OS meaning that the core i9 equipped
model throttled well below base clock at
a hundred degrees now they promptly
fixed it but is it fixed or is it just
software trickery to mask a bad design
to find out we designed a little test
we compared the MacBook Pro 2018 and the
Mac Mini
running the blender classroom rendering
test using their stock cooling solutions
at room temperature against the exact
same two machines inside a custom chill
box of our own creation that we held
well below ambient temperatures
and what's obvious from our test is that
in Apple's pursuit of sex appeal they're
leaving a significant amount of
performance on the table for their users
now the obvious retort might be yeah but
that's a totally unrealistic scenario
would a laptop PC achieved these results
and in fairness the answer in many cases
is no most notebooks PC and Mac alike
with Intel age K series chips thermal
throttle but many of them to a lesser
degree part of the problem boils down to
intel's delays in getting their 10
nanometer production going and this is
compounded by their recent pattern of
releasing processors with TDP s so this
is the amount of heat that they're
supposed to output that are SPECT much
lower than they actually should be
they've even done this with some of
their desktop processors essentially
what they're doing right now then is
stuffing more and more cores into the
same package size as before but with the
same transistor size meaning that
they're generating more heat that means
that the only way for a manufacturer to
rein in these chips is to test them
themselves then over build their cooling
solution which clearly can actually be
done it's just that Apple isn't doing it
and the thing is that even if you don't
care about getting every last drop of
performance out of your computer
this creates all their problems to a
computer any computer for a fact will
fail more quickly when subjected to
higher operating temperatures over its
lifetime and this can come about in a
whole host of different ways just ask
Louis Rossman or for that matter anyone
who's owned a 2011 or 2012 MacBook Pro
with a dedicated GPU not only is heat
bad for the chips themselves the ones
producing it it's actually also
unhealthy for the board that they're
attached to hot spots on a PCB can and
will cause flexing and warping as the
materials repeatedly expand and contract
which can
turn lead to BGA components breaking
away from their solder pads and that's
to say nothing of the health of any
surface mount components nearby like
capacitors or resistors all of which
would require either a time-consuming
repair or if you go the official route a
costly and wasteful replacement of the
entire board
so then what gives why would Apple do
this to their hardware well when it
comes to the performance question it
seems to be because for a large enough
of proportion of their customers the
looks and the status symbol of owning
the machine are just more important than
whether it's actually quick off the line
although on that note one innovation in
recent CPU designs that has masked
apples negligence is the advent of turbo
boost Intel's name for a technology that
dramatically boosts the clock speed of a
CPU temporarily during short bursts of
activity like while loading a webpage or
launching an application turbo boost
allows machines like their 2015 MacBook
to actually feel pretty snappy in day to
day use but require literal water
cooling to reach peak performance in
heavy workloads as for the reliability
issues honestly my best guess is that
they just don't care I'm sure like any
insurance company they've done the
analysis of their failure rates over
time to ensure that Apple Care customers
are covered by the policy that they
bought and then as for the ones who
didn't buy Apple Care but guess you
should have bought Apple Care it's not
like you can take your business
somewhere else if you want Mac OS the
real head-scratcher here for me though
is that Apple considers it okay for even
their professional-grade computers to
throttle like this but not for their
flagship iPhone you can run games or
benchmarks all day long on this thing
and never lose any performance to heat
compare that to competing Android
handsets and you've got yourself
actually a very compelling reason to buy
an iPhone so why this difference in
philosophy
oh sorry oh you were waiting for an
answer I actually don't have one but
what I will do is I'm gonna put that on
my list of things to ask my good friend
Tim Apple if he ever agrees to sit down
for an interview with me although I
sincerely doubt that's ever going to
happen because I'm going on the record
now saying that my next question then
will be why do you advertise your
products in ways that you know for a
fact are misleading the 2018 MacBook
Pros product page is a great example of
this so you can see 4.8 gigahertz touted
as the cpu speed up front but you
probably won't notice that further down
the base clock that this machine
struggles to maintain by the way is just
2.9 gigahertz a difference of almost 40%
that performance disparity is gonna take
the MacBook Pro from feeling quick and
snappy while surfing the web to feeling
sluggish and unresponsive the moment
that you start a render and it stops
boosting and that's not even considering
the dedicated GPU you run both the CPU
and the GPU simultaneously like in a
game or a hardware assisted video export
and you're in for a pretty bad time one
of the most frustrating aspects of all
of this is that they're blatantly doing
it on purpose in our recent video where
we used liquid metal thermal interface
material on the MacBook Pro we found
that even with better cooling
temperatures were the same so Apple took
advantage of the extra thermal Headroom
by keeping the fans low for as long as
possible instead of attempting to boost
the CPUs performance for longer I mean I
get it nobody wants their fans to ramp
up like a jet engine just because they
loaded a big file in Photoshop that made
the CPU work for five seconds but if
we're running an all core load we're
hitting 90 plus degrees for more than
that the system needs to kick its fans
into overdrive in order to protect
itself
as for why Apple doesn't just equip its
machines with processors that are more
suited to the form factors that they
target remember guys a slower CPU that
doesn't throttle is not slower than a
faster one that does we're not sure why
they don't do that
the only answer we can come up with is
low marketing but whatever the real
reason is the conclusion is clear here
Apple is specifically targeting the less
tech-savvy market with their promises of
magical high performance thin design
lightweight and low noise all with
stellar battery life but you simply
can't avoid the laws of physics and
there is nothing magical about what
they're doing hide your true IP address
