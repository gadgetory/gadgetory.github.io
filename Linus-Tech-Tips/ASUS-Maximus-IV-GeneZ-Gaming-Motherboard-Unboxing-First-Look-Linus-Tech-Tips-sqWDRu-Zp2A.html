of a micro ATX motherboard for the LGA
1155 platform that includes support for
SLE like it di cross by ATI crossfire
I think what they surely mean is AMD
crossfire X it uses the Intel z68
chipset so yes this is a version of an
m-80 X Republic of gamers motherboard
that uses a Z type chipset rather than
the P 67 chipset which means you have
support for Intel SRT technology which
stands for mix your hard drive go faster
using an SSD and then we've also got
support for virtue which is using the
lucid hydrologic software in order to
use the integrated GPU for things like
transcoding video and saving power and
using your dedicated GPU or GPUs in the
example here for running games and like
other baller stuff like that
okay so so premium FX X Phi 2 is
built-in so you got decent onboard sound
game first which is something to do with
prioritizing your network traffic Rajee
Connect which is kind of neat so you can
use a USB cable to plug in and overclock
your board using another computer this
is cool
BIOS print one-click easily share your
BIOS settings so you can print out your
BIOS settings very neat because this is
very helpful for helping other people
with their stuff GPU dim post is okay
this is kind of pulling named actually
because what they really mean is like
GPU and memory post Diagnostics and I
think they're trying to shorten it a
little too much because it's a cool tool
but they've made it kind of hard to
communicate exactly what it does so from
within the BIOS you can actually easily
diagnose which cards are plugged into
which dims if they're detected properly
or dims slots for the PCIe slots whether
they're being detected properly and that
will allow you to more easily diagnose
any issues that you're having with the
system so let's have a look at what
we've got included here's our ROG
connect cable we've got some
cable ties we've got an short SLI bridge
that's a flexible bridge I prefer to see
a black one or a red one on a board like
this but that's okay we've got front
panel connectors we've got an ad for
zone R sound cards which I definitely
believe are awesome I'm a big fan of
this guy right here the sense although
the essence STX is very popular as well
dense is what I'm using personally
though all right we've got six SATA
cables two of which are say two three
six gigabit per second right angle
cables and four which are say two to
three gigabit per second right angle
cables although any of them will
probably work for any of them okay we've
got our i/o shield our user guide
including a DVD which you should throw
away and download the latest drivers
from the Asus website Republican gamers
sticker which you cannot download from
the Asus website you'll have to have to
use that one hard drive label so you can
go ahead and label your your cables
label your cables on the tables before
playing all three tables but not on a PC
because Microsoft doesn't support the PC
the way they support Xbox which is not
really related to this motherboard here
is an ROG sticker there we go
all right things back in here the other
thing back in the other thing all right
this is the Maximus Ford Jean Z you know
ever since the original like okay do you
guys remember how hard it was to find a
performance micro ATX motherboard even a
few years ago like I remember back in
the unforce four days EVGA was the only
one the only one who went and released
an n force for sli motherboard in the
micro ATX form factor and even then it
wasn't a great board I mean ooh it had
all kinds of bugs I had one at one point
it was not a great board had like a
goofy color scheme just her
and then all of a sudden dfi started
this trend they released a performance
micro ATX board and all of a sudden
gigabyte and a zeus and msi they're like
all on this bandwagon a performance
boards now i think it's great because
the reality of it is this is all your
power and your cpu socket in your memory
and that's all the same size as an ATX
board here you've got enough room for
dual GPU so whether it's sli or
crossfire you can put in two dual slot
GPUs and since you've got decent onboard
sound decent onboard land decent onboard
everything else you could possibly need
I mean this this is this is now just a
smaller version of everything that you
can put on an ATX board you've got all
of that performance even things like
voltage check points and you save a
little bit of power by using a smaller
PCB fewer chips and all that good stuff
powering fewer slots and yeah it's just
smaller I think small gating boxes are
cool I built myself gaming box in an SG
oh one Sugo system was water-cooled I
took the top of the system and I turned
the whole thing into a triple rad and
then like put a little shroud around it
and put some grilles on so people
wouldn't like stick their fingers in so
yeah sorry the battery ran out I'm back
all right so let's have a look at the
overall layout of the board here's our
LGA 1155 socket which supports all the
latest core i3 Core i5 and core i7 CPU
including unlocked ones because this is
a z68 board
so all those overclocking features are
enabled we got some beefy looking heat
sinks here check those out from an angle
they look kind of like like 2d sprites
of something like a dragon
Jinxy check this out there's this little
eye and there's this little like mouth
thing and there's his wings right there
like that's his wing it's kind of like
his rump right there see you see the
dragon cool I think it's a dragon so our
eight pin power connector is up in the
top left corner of the board we've got a
couple of look at that two CPU fan
connectors see why does it take a Seuss
to think of simple things like that so
many CPU coolers have dual fans why
don't you have two CPU fan header as
well
asou thinks you do need two CPU fan
headers and I think they're right for
ddr3 dimms slots supporting up to
probably 32 gigs of memory it would be
my guess in dual time
because that is what is supported by
these CPUs we've got all of our V
checkpoints here including ground around
CPUSA io PCH I GPU CPU PLL CPU and an
additional ground our 24-pin power
connectors and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge we got another four
pin pwm fan connector one USB a 3.0
front panel connector there's your BIOS
chip if you care we've also got to say
two three six gigabit per second ports
and four SATA SATA 3 six gigabit per
second ports and four stated two three
gigabit per second ports got a chipset
heatsink here that's not cooling much
these days there's not a whole lot that
goes on in the chipset we've got our
front panel connectors so for your power
reset all that good stuff two USB 2.0
front panel ports another four pin PWM
fan connector they really do squeeze a
lot on to this tiny PCB post readout
start and reset switches that are both
built on front panel audio and then the
two x PCIe 16x slots although this one
is only wired for 8x so what you've got
essentially here is 16 X 8 X 8 X or 16 X
1 X 4 X 8 X 8 X 4 X that is what you are
looking at so here is yet another 4 pin
PWM and let's go ahead and count them
all so 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 pin PWM fan
connectors uh uh so let's have a look on
the back we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 USB
2.0 ports we've got a ps2 keyboard mouse
combo port we've got the that's the BIOS
reflashing nope that's clear seamless
look at that ok clear CMOS 2 USB 3.0
ports Gigabit Ethernet optical audio out
HDMI out which you're gonna want to go
ahead and use if you want to use the
Intel XI what's it called quick smart
smart response no hold on Smart Response
technology is the hard drive one quick
sync
I think it's quick sync the one where
you use your integrated GPU in order to
do video transcoding we've also got 7.1
audio out and those look like gold
plated connectors very nice touch so
