SD card and USB reader for your mobile
devices check the link in the video
description to learn more about the
adata dashdrive air AE 400 we've been
reached out to many times with people
asking how they can support linus tech
tips particularly the linus tech tips
com forum other than disabling adblock
liking on facebook following on twitter
watching more videos clicking on the
videos more and just generally following
our every moves at every possible waking
moment which not everyone wants to do
and we totally understand but that
doesn't mean that you don't want to
contribute in some way and there are
costs associated with running a
community forum such as the one that we
have on Linus tech tips com I find it
funny that Linus decides to bring up
cost of the forum when I sure hasn't
paid me anything but there have
definitely been a lot of costs to the
forum I pay you some not much Oh anyway
those of you who might remember the
forum started on a test bench under my
desk at my house hoping that it might be
able to withstand what was thrown at it
running a beta version of vbulletin 5
which was a horrible idea made by Linus
but it has moved multiple times is now
sitting on a rack in a data center and
has a plethora of other things that are
helping us keep it up if you're one of
the veterans who are around forever
again you'll remember the immense amount
of down time that we had we've mostly
been staying alive lately and that's not
cheap speaking of staying alive valve is
a bunch of geniuses because digital
items are apparently worth real currency
and our way to show your support for
something that you really enjoy so on
the linus tech tips forum we have
implemented a badge or pin system that
goes next to your posts now there are
some that you can't buy such as being a
member of the folding at home team or
being a moderator or other examples like
that but for the first time ever this
campaign will be running for a month you
can contribute to the linus tech tips
forum to earn an exclusive first blood
badge we're calling this the first blood
campaign because it's the first time
because that those aren't even words
because
this is the first time that we've ever
taken donations to support anything that
we've ever done so by being one of our
first supporters you will have one of
these badges no one else can ever get
one ever so there's four tiers of badges
and you can contribute whatever you want
but if you contribute at least ten
dollars you get a bronze badge at least
twenty-five dollars you get a silver
badge and at least fifty dollars you get
a gold badge now they have the right
corresponding backgrounds but the blood
on the color increases depending on
which bad you get and these badges are
designed to be more exclusive they
aren't that cheap but we don't expect
that many people to get them because
they are supposed to be like the first
time thing they're only available for
this month and like most starter and
IndieGoGo 'he's this isn't one but like
most of them they have that insane tier
thing at the bottom that like no one
should realistically by if they have any
amount of logic but it's there and- so
the logic process here was what could
possibly represent higher than bronze
silver or gold platinum you might say to
which I would reply no wrong the answer
is of course pink so for five hundred
dollars then that would be like we said
we weren't really expecting anyone to
buy this I will hand draw you as close
as I can possibly get in mspaint and
which will be terrible so let's set the
expectations where they should be we
will film the process and create a
dedicated video for you thanking you for
your purchase of the pink level badge so
it'll be hand drawn by me we're going to
video it we're going to call you out and
say thank you very much at the beginning
of one of our other videos and that's
what you get for for a
five-hundred-dollar contribution which i
I really don't think anyone's going to
do this if they do then Color Me color
me surprised speaking of colors guys get
your badges now click on the link in the
video description or check out the
banner on the top right of the linus
tech tips com forum and thank you very
much for letting us know what you think
of this idea because I'm sure even by
the time you've made
this far in the video you've already
posted a comment saying whether you like
it or dislike it under the video so
thanks in advance for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
