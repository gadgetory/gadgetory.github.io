I've been meaning to do ever since I did
my unboxing of the DCs 11:30
in fact I've had it set up in my living
room ever since then but I wanted to
show you guys the mydlink software which
is actually pretty cool so we can't see
a whole lot right now because Rumble is
standing right in front of the camera
Rumble c'mere rumble baby come here so
let's see if he'll move yep there he
goes he's moving he's coming towards us
there he goes he comes down so basically
what I want you guys to do is here I'm
gonna grab the iPhone and so hopefully
you guys can see this kind of like like
picture and picture here and then the
objective would be for one of the cats
to go up on the cat tree so you can see
how how smooth the motion is it's
actually surprisingly good
now it's streaming over Wi-Fi right now
but at about half of the frame rate of
hood frame weight frame rate of what
it's doing right now I can actually
stream it over 3G and I can monitor my
camera from work which is pretty cool
the mydlink software is available not
only as an iPhone app so you can see
here it's just a little app you log in
you can access all of your different
cameras at home it shows you which ones
are connected and yeah it's that simple
you just click it boom done and it's
actually you know here right here let's
fit listen let's do it on 3G right now
just so that I can show you guys since I
have the the cats cooperating and doing
what they're supposed to be doing so
Wi-Fi off and let's go on to mydlink
light here so you can see it's still
snappy still responsive boom I'm logged
in just like that I am on 3G now and I
can see the cat grooming himself right
there the frame rate is quite a bit
lower but what it does allow you to do
is at least see what is going on so he's
not actually moving
right now it isn't helpful rocket be
quiet okay well here hold on let's see
if we can get him to move I'll just kick
this thing a bit don't chase that please
here we go here comes rocket rocket jump
up there please come on baby Oh Grady
went down in the bottom oh there he
stuck his head out the front so you can
kind of see there's quite a bit of a
delay on 3G but that's about what you'd
expect on Wi-Fi it performs admirably
well and overall I'm quite impressed
with both the software as well as this
little camera so uh thank you guys for
checking it out and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and hey if
you want to see more videos of my cat's
rocket and Rumble you can also subscribe
to Linus cat tips I don't really give
any tips is mostly just cute videos of
my cats but see how cute there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
