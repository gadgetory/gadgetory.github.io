Microsoft Windows 7 now I realize
there's not really a whole lot to unbox
here there's a lot of text about making
sure that you agree to all of this stuff
before you open it so let's get started
basically Windows 7 what does it bring
to the table well we've got the Home
Premium Edition here today and there are
a couple other editions there's
professional and yet professional is
back folks it's no longer called
business and then there's also the
Ultimate Edition so with our home
premium here we get welcome to your PC
simplified this OEM software may not be
delivered under a blah blah blah unless
accompanied ok so we're gonna lift pick
up these there's your Windows 7 home
premium becomes in a dual case that is
sealed as per this so let's find out
what is in the documentation first so
then we'll talk a little bit about
Windows 7 itself it's uh it's about a
simpler PC from day one okay that's
great three easy steps let's get
personal
awesome so they're giving you a couple
little basics about how to use the OS
and they talk through they actually we
should show this I think we talked about
a lot of the stuff that they've done to
make things better so first of all the
taskbar has been improved you can have
multiple windows that just pop up to
show you all of the different things
that you have open in for example
Internet Explorer so you've got 3 ie
windows open you can preview them and
then click the one you want that's
pretty useful they've also got these
what are these called jump lists so that
gives you common tasks that you do
according to what you use this program
for so they're using Windows Media
Player as an example so you frequently
do this and then they're giving you some
standard ones as well
and then there's also the desktop
preview which is really useful so you
drag your mouse down to the very bottom
right and then one of the other things
that I really like about it is Aero
shake so basically all you need to do is
shake a window it'll maximize and then
if you shake it again I believe it
minimizes and if you use the arrow snap
you actually just drag a window to the
left to the right or to the top to
maximize so if you drag it to the right
it takes up the right half of your
screen if you drag it to the left it'll
go to the left half of your screen so
that's a pretty cool feature as well oh
here's the desk
preview one so it just makes all of your
windows translucent and you can see the
desktop if you click it then you'll go
to the desktop just like the show
desktop button on Windows Vista and
Windows XP so Windows Media Center is
one of the big features included with
Home Premium and let's talk a little bit
about the differences between home
premium professional and ultimate so our
disks looks like just our standard
Windows DVD it's a 64-bit edition here
you can buy it in 32 or 64-bit I'd
really recommend going 64-bit at this
point though Windows 7 Professional ok
Windows 7 Professional gives you a
couple of options that you don't have
with Home Premium first of all you get
XP mode so XP mode means that you can
run any xp application in a hundred
percent compatibility mode you do need a
virtualization ready processor so make
sure that you have that but it looks
like a really cool feature the other
thing you get with both XP Pro with the
XP Pro with 7 Professional and 7
ultimate is the ability to downgrade to
Vista Business Vista ultimate
respectively or to Windows XP Pro all
you have to do is install Windows XP Pro
enter any old serial you can find it
doesn't even have to be a valid one to
be perfectly honest with you then you go
to activate it'll fail you call out
Microsoft you say hey I'm downgrading
them you get your Windows you give them
your Windows 7 key they'll give you a
valid Windows XP key to use until you're
ready to go back to Windows 7 so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of
Microsoft Windows 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
