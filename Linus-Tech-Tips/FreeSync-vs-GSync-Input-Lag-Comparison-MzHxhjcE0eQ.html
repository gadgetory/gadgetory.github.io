refreshing on a hot day these guys
aren't a sponsor no today what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
taking g-sync so this is the Green Team
over here this green graphics card and
that black monitor with a red light okay
don't worry too much about it that's the
Green Team over there and then on the
red team we have the r9 fury X which is
actually inside this computer right now
and the BenQ XL 27:30 Z so I would
consider that in the rog swift PG - 7 8
q pretty much equivalent as far as a
g-sync versus a freesync monitor goes so
we're going to be doing something pretty
interesting we're going to be taking a
look at which g-sync or freesync both
with 144 Hertz displays offers the
lowest input lag so the least latency
between pressing the mouse and firing
the gun stay tuned
vote for turnip it's a shirt
I don't have one so we're gonna do our
best to demo what it looks like and this
is not what the real shirt looks like it
looks a little more like this but we
didn't have a sample to show you guys so
this had to do you can stay tuned after
the outro for bonus footage of the
creation of this masterpiece if you're
into that sort of thing so the first
thing I'll need to do is oh yeah guys
this just arrived today drop a like on
the video if you want to see the 3dr
solo taken for a test drive we've
actually got some pretty good ideas
Burkle who just about killed himself
recently on his mountain bike wants to
test the follow feature on his bike so
drop a dislike if you think that that's
a terrible idea
and we should actually go ahead and just
review it normally so the first thing
we're going to need is on my desk over
here now one of the better methodologies
that I found online and I love those
guys over at Blair Buster's they make my
job so much easier one of the better
methodologies i've found online is to
have an LED that illuminates on an input
to the computer so in this case we're
going to be using the makey makey which
has indicator LEDs on board and then
we're just going to go ahead and we're
going to do a mouse click that's going
to light up and then we're going to be
able to see how many milliseconds it
takes with a high-speed camera before
our muzzle flare or flash whatever the
bullet comes out of the gun so here we
go let's head downstairs and get our
monitors together
I like these vlog style videos because
this is basically what's happening with
every one of our videos except with this
style you guys get to kind of come along
for the ride as we go on voyages of
discovery in the labyrinth that is the
LMG headquarters to find the hardware
that we need in order to make whatever
stupid video it is we're trying to make
that day so I am only half standing on a
rotating sphere disc machine ball well
at least this isn't heavy
really fairly heavy okay here we go no I
got this
what don't turn don't don't turn don't
turn
okay and let's down never do that ah why
did I pack this monitor up I knew I
wanted to do this comparison all of what
we do is nothing without editing okay so
you got both monitors here all right
competitors lovers no one is sure what
I'm talking about
no that's okay that's fine that's normal
everything is fine for some reason it
started working I don't know why and I'm
not going to question it okay yes
victorious
yes okay so what made the mouse work no
device is detected what do you mean no
device is detected okay so now that my
stupid piece of crap windows 7 install
has completely itself and won't work
with a keyboard or mouse which I'm going
to diagnose later with my handy-dandy
ps2 keyboard and mouse I can install a
USB keyboard or Mouse trust me we've
tried we are going we've gone ahead and
switched to my Windows 8 test drive and
it is time to get the makey makey up and
running first of all so we've we've set
it up for click and ground and then
we're going to position this so we can
see the activity LED but look at that we
clicked well hold on hold on well I got
to put it somewhere useful okay ready so
you can watch the LED illuminate just
like that okay so that led is going to
be the indicator of when the gunfire
should start in Crysis 3 now the reason
we're using Crysis 3 is that blur
Buster's has already done the groundwork
for us those guys are awesome which I
think I already said once but it
deserves being said again and have found
that Crysis 3 uses a particularly not
leggy engine not as much as csgo mind
you but csgo requires some fiddling
around with max FPS settings within the
console that we're just not going to do
here so we've got our fury X on the
bench I've got the latest drivers that
just finished downloading we're gonna go
ahead and install those and boom we're
gonna find out how much latency between
click and display with free sync enabled
all right so the first thing we're going
to need to do is enable free sync now
this is not quite as cut and dried as it
used to be with g-sync because you can
also enable or disable vsync from within
game so we're actually going to have to
look at it four different ways we're
going to have 144 Hertz with three sync
with vsync on or off then we're going to
do G sync with the same thing with vsync
on or off and then have
look at how things go okay so we're in
our game we're going to target 200 FPS
for our uncapped scenario and then
basically all we're going to do is we
are going to fire them out our pal fire
the mouse I fire the gun like that now
this is our sony fs7 hundred camera and
what it will be doing is recording the
screen at 480 frames per second unless
we discover that 480 frames per second
is not good enough in which case we will
record at 960 FPS but the image gets
very grainy and very dark at that
framerate so it's a little bit harder to
work with so we're really hoping for the
best
here so uh let's get started where's
that damn remote it's not under the
motherboard that's good it shouldn't
have been there here it is so the
geniuses at Sony which I have clearly
demonstrated myself to be a more genius
then installed the remote IR sensor for
this camera in the back of it so the
talent may never actually use it you
know I don't know maybe like here and
like sticking out so it works from any
direction whatever so I use reflective
tape here and then I can be like Blau
bounce it and it will start and stop
just like that that way I will be able
to start the slow-motion recording which
only runs for four seconds I will be
able to take some shots not that kind of
take shots what kind of videos you think
we make around here and then I will be
able to review the footage start nope it
didn't work and stucked here we go 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and it's
probably done now
okay so let's check it out let's check
it out so here we go here we go here we
go
you can clearly see a delay and this is
running faster than the actual footage
will be exciting so let's come back with
some numbers so welcome to the next step
in the process it's actually been in a
head ended up taking me like three hours
or something like that
run all the numbers that I needed but
basically what it amounts to is I've got
my folder full of clips here so these
are all slow-motion clips of here we go
so check this out so you can see these
are at 960 frames per second so like
this you can barely you can actually see
the individual blades of the fan
spinning and then what you're going to
see here is a significant delay
eventually right here we go here we go
between the light and the actual muzzle
flash so that's not good enough what we
need to do is take this footage and dump
it into Adobe Premiere where we can make
an approximate equivalency of one of our
frames is about a millisecond and then
what we do is we actually find the exact
frame where the top LED begins to
illuminate and then we count 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 20 23 1 2 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 30 31 32 there we go
and then when we see the first hint of
the muzzle flash animation that's when I
make my mark that's when I put down my
result and we're already getting some
really interesting results which is
turning this into more like a regular
Linus tech tips at this point not very
vlogging with like grass and everything
but sometimes I'm just not in control of
what video I end up making I set out to
do one thing and then it's like all of a
sudden I'm making videos about Subway
sandwich napkins in the way that you
could actually use one to replace the
built in eraser on your dry erase marker
if it was too full of crap with just a
pair of scissors and a double-a battery
to help you also some tape ah yes a
knife it's covered in peanut butter oh
my god why am I sitting at Erin's desk
so I'm not sure if it's because they
think it improves their job security but
my asshole editors let me sit here for
an hour counting frames one by one
instead of just showing me this super
easy way to do it by changing this to
frames and then just marking in and out
and then getting a frame count right
here so that
a faster way to do that little do they
know that that does not improve job
security we just told you I'm going to
replace them all with robots these these
are the future video editing like that
so I feel a bit like every Linus tech
tips video is sort of like like life you
know you start out with joy and hope and
belief that the world makes sense and
then by the end of it you're this jaded
bitter soul that just what the hell is
going on here
so all right I'll put all the results up
on screen for you guys or more
accurately I'll have an editor do it
since as you obviously know I don't know
how to use Adobe Premiere so I'm at high
frame rate so that 144 F Hertz 144 FPS
remember we're using g-sync or free sync
regardless of what else is going on with
vsync or no vsync so with no vsync um
g-sync really does okay but freesync
actually comes out ahead at 1440p with
the excel 2730 looking like it's overall
a lower input leg chain along with the
iron.i in fury X so with vsync however
so this is G sink with vsync the way
NVIDIA intended for it to be used before
they eventually caved and allowed vsync
to be turned off now we see G sink
really come into its own with not only
really really low latency between LED
light illumination and muzzle flash but
also a really tight grouping of the of
latency here with free sync being a
little bit sloppier now when we move up
to 200 FPS you can see that no vsync
doesn't actually give us on G sync and
input lag reduction
whereas with AMD freesync now that we
have D synchronized we are actually
getting a proportional improvement in
our input lag this is what we expect but
this is where my brain explodes at 45
fps remember this is the sweet spot for
variable refresh rate gaming with vsync
disabled Nvidia just clean
up cleans house we're talking 72 to 73
frames with our camera that is
outstanding at only 45 fps that is an
incredible delay with free sync not only
much higher but also a little bit all
over the place in terms of the latency
then we turn vsync on and I just
retested this to make sure I wasn't
crazy
if we turn vsync on forcing it through
the driver or turning it on in game I
just retested it g-sync is actually as
bad or worse than free sync so
ultimately today we have raised more
questions than we have answered uh what
we do know is that at least on AMD
freesync you are going to if you're
going to exceed the maximum refresh rate
of your monitor then you are probably
going to want to go ahead and disable
vsync if you want that 10 millisecond
improvement in input latency it's open
like the responsiveness and on g-sync
if you're going to be playing in that 45
FPS sweet spot where I guess Nvidia
intended for it to be used then you are
going to want vsync off for some reason
but then if you're going to be playing
at a much higher refresh rate it looks
like vsync on that is the cat's pajamas
with g-sync
so let us know in the comments if your
interpretation here is is different than
my own and thank you for tuning in to
this little adventure I'm just going to
look at my calendar and it looks like
I'm supposed to tell you about mass drop
but I have no idea what their featured
product is so I'll film that at a later
time so thanks for watching guys like
the garb know I have a new outro dislike
the video if you disliked it you guys
know how to do that like it if you did
like it they'll also get subscribed
maybe even consider contributing to us
whether it's directly through our forum
by buying a t-shirt or by shopping at
Amazon with our affiliate code once
you've done all that stuff and you're
looking for something new to watch
apparently we just released I guess we
just release our fury X vs. 980ti small
form-factor you know uber gaming machine
showdown so check that
out and guess we're done here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
