tootinest roughest toughest battle to
ever take place between internet
browsers at least since google chrome
showed up on the scene a few years back
and gave everyone else a giant wedgie
err
whatever's going on in that picture with
its lightning-fast performance and
lightweight system resource usage but
that was then and this is now and now is
project Spartan or excuse me I mean
Microsoft edge the internet exploration
tool see what I did there that comes
with Windows 10 and wants your attention
but should you switch to it I guess
we'll be talking about that won't we
also I'll be pleading for your likes on
this video like on a like badger or
something look can we just get an
illustration of what a like badger would
look like thanks yeah like one of those
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their all-new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors click the link in the
video description to learn more so while
the focus in this video is going to be
on the speed benchmarks we performed in
Microsoft edge first things first
Microsoft ever claims that edge is the
fastest browser on the block so then
what does it promise to deliver that
other perfectly capable options
don't great question and we're actually
going to have a full video about this on
our tech quickie channel quite shortly
so get subscribed over there for that
but in a nutshell Microsoft has got
three main pillars for edge number one
is easy markup of web pages and then
easy sharing so I guess useful for
surface series tablet users and those
people who are freakishly skilled at
drawing with a mouse number two is
Reading Mode which sweeps the
unnecessary stuff out of the way it
allows you to focus on what your well
reading and number three is having
Cortana as a co-pilot who suggests stuff
and delivers instant search results with
Bing unfortunately but hey whatever
Microsoft I never wanted to actually
download anything that time when I was
searching for a thunderbolt driver
anyway man I hate Bing
how hard is this but anyway just like
you're not tied to edge on Windows 10
though they do make default browser
switching a little more complicated than
before you are not tied to being with
Cortana in edge if you wanted to pair
her with a stronger search engine which
I guess ties well into the unofficial
but in my opinion super important fourth
pillar that's coming a bit later proper
support for extensions like the other
two leading browsers from Mozilla and
Google but enough of that let's talk
performance John was the one who put
together this benchmarking set up for
this video and I think he did a bang-up
job
we used a core i7 59 30 K with 16 gigs
of DDR 4 RAM and a Samsung 850 Pro SSD
and all tests were run on a fresh copy
of Windows 10 64 bit with all the latest
versions of all browsers running vanilla
without extensions to ensure a fair
fight first up is browser mark which
analyzes both the performance and
standards compliance of a given browser
here chrome and opera remember it's
chrome based
away with the contest with an overall
score of over 6,000 each both edge and
Internet Explorer 11 get crushed next is
a variety of mostly JavaScript focused
benchmarks with some twists peacekeeper
also looks at performance of a 2d game
web expert looks at html5 canvas
performance and html5 tests as you can
well imagine dials in on html5
performance and this went pretty well
overall with edge only being badly
beaten in speedometer and html5 tests
and even pulling out victories in
SunSpider and jet stream for our next
test we wanted to take a look at RAM
usage because while it's all fine and
good to talk about performance on a six
core machine with 16 gigs or 16 memory
not everyone is running a configuration
like that so at idle Internet Explorer
11 comes out on top with edge coming in
second place then under what I'd
consider to be a fairly typical load
with an HD YouTube video playing Twitter
and Facebook open a long Wikipedia
article loaded up somewhere else the
Amazon homepage and CNN home page edge
falls apart managing even worse
performance than our second last
finisher Chrome a browser that is well
known for its RAM eating habits these
days we're not all about synthetics
around here though so in our testing we
also threw in some real-world stuff and
John whipped out the high-speed camera
to do some practical web page loading
tests edge was put up against Chrome
side by side on our 200 megabit
guaranteed fiber line and the results
were measured by analyzing the footage
to see how long the pages took to load
for YouTube videos Facebook and Amazon I
think it's safe to say that the
difference was fairly negligible to a
normal person but for CNN edge got
beaten by nearly a second bummer so the
conclusion here is pretty straight
forward edge isn't the fastest browser
out there which no one not even
Microsoft claimed it would be and it
still struggles with some compatibility
issues although that won't surprise you
if you've read any of the user reviews
out there on the net but the good news
is that it is a big leap forward
compared to Internet Explorer 11 which
came in last in all but two of the
benchmarks we ran so here's two
improvement Microsoft let's see if edge
can
continue to improve compatibility enough
in the next year or so to justify its
cool unique features speaking of cool
unique features Braintree Braintree
