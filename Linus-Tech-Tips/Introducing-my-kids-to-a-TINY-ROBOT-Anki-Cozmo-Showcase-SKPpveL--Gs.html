from Luke's tour of on keys lab where
they created it in October of last year
at the time it was meant to be a durable
toy and robot pet but over the last year
on Keys team of PhD roboticists
animators and game developers has been
hard at work making it more interactive
more expressive and more playful and
even adding a block-based programming
function called collab that is coming in
December
so when Hongki reached out about
sponsoring a video I figured yeah sure
why not
let's take a look at the progress
they've made but this time rather than
having the tallest member of the Linus
Media Group team take a look at it we
would change gears a little bit and have
the shortest one take a look
well why don't you sit Lister oh it must
be one heavy box the amount of grunting
and groaning it's a little robot should
we get the QuickStart guide out hey
darlin you're putting everything back in
the package oh you want to put it in so
we've got the Cosmo app right there
then we need to power up the Cosmo I
need you to put it right on here hold on
searching for Cosmo that console is prek
the cube on its own okay well done
console would like to meet you
what did it say eyes oh man it's a
little man grab any cute with circling
blue lights fake that cube unto its own
lights globe bright only press the cube
or conjure can see so he set himself
before we go any further do you guys
want to pick at red color and which one
do you want okay Who am I to say no you
can't have one red and one blue now you
press spark a trick so you can watch
Cosmo roll excu I think Cosmo is already
working on it so you have filled cosmos
play need each day you need to fill his
play need and you'll earn a play token
all right build the stack of cubes and
Cosmo will tip it over you want to try
different there so this shows you how to
set up the game and then you tap if the
colors match oh there you go
Cosmo gets pretty upset when you lose
and say oh there's a three color mode
that you unlock so whenever you win one
of these games it unlocks more difficult
ones tempt Cosmo to pounce on a cube
then pull it away before he did you get
it you got a point
is it teasing you oh no got it
so why don't we try the codelab now so
this is cold this is block coding but
with Cosmo Hey pick up the block and put
it over there you like yeah he does that
they're his blocks I wonder if it still
remembers me from when I first tried
this a little while ago
or trying discover sure use your
creativity to program Cosmo and explore
things you can do together let's blow
the world through clock oh oh this looks
cool so Cosmo has a 30 frame per second
VGA camera that it uses to look at its
surroundings so that includes looking
for these cubes as well as looking for
faces that it recognizes whoa check this
out
human hey you if you click see inside it
shows you the block codes it starts the
program then when the flag is clicked it
broadcasts a message message one Cosmo
asks for a question one message one
received then 19 curious animation so
constructor mode lets you create your
own stuff so you can pick some sample
ones so here when the flag is clicked
repeat for thrive 100 millimeters so
it's 10 centimeters at 15 millimeters
per second turn 90 degrees at 45 degrees
per second look at that so you can
program cosmo using code to do just
about anything do you want to make cosmo
drive in a bigger square so do you see
the one here that says drive yeah so how
many millimeters should we put in there
should we maybe put 200 millimeters 200
yeah cuz right now it's 100 like 200 so
now cosmo is gonna go in a bigger square
neat huh it's got all kinds of stuff in
here like pick random numbers set text
alignment the rectangle forms
crying mode when cubes are tapped when
faces are seen now this actually looks
quite powerful we added an animation
playing a tease music after the end of
each length of our square so let's see
what happens so it does this and this
and then it plays our music like all
good it's playing them on top of each
other
do you like Katie's music yeah do you
want to put cosmo on the charger and
then go get ready for trick-or-treating
yes all right so final points here cosmo
is secure it's actually a point-to-point
connection between your phone and the
robot itself so there's no data stored
in the cloud whatsoever or anything like
that code lab the really powerful block
based programming tool is coming
sometime late in December and I think
that pretty much wraps it up so thanks
to Anki for sponsoring this video you
can check out cosmo including the
limited edition metallic one at the
links in the video description and get
yourself a fun little toy slash learning
tool that code lab functionality is
actually a lot more powerful than I was
expecting I hadn't seen it until they
sent over the early access beta of the
app so go check it out at the link below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
