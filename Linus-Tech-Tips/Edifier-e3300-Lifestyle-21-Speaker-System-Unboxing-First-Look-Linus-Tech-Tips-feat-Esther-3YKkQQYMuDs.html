unboxing and the reason that I have to
do this while we're still in front of
the tree is the thing that I'm unboxing
is actually the Christmas present that I
gave to Esther and if she's on the ball
she'll be putting in an annotation so
you can check out her Facebook page she
also works at NCIX and if she could
hurry up and get her butt into the frame
then we'd actually be able to have a
look at the Christmas present that I got
for her Thank You Esther so let's get a
quick photo of the gift giving
presentation and our camera person
jumped the gun a little bit
there we go awesome okay no Esther
kindly is allowing me to do an unboxing
camera person come on in and let's have
a look at the Edifier a 3300 multimedia
speakers so these are a lifestyle model
of speakers so what that means is that
sound is a concern as it always is with
Empire they are a speaker company they
are a separate company coming closer and
the difference is that with their
lifestyle models you will need to be
able to appreciate style a little bit
more than you would have to if you were
just going purely for sound so let's
start with what we got here to start
with let's start with what we have the
start with you can tell I'm tired it's
been a very long very long Christmas so
here we go we have the multimedia
speaker system users manual so that is
going to show you what is inside the box
it's going to show you how to set it up
not all speaker so it gives you some
troubleshooting tips awesome thanks that
a fire okay the next thing we're going
to find is a oh this is a three and a
half inch to three and a half inch jack
audio cable so just your standard 35 mil
whatever your standard like headphone
jack audio cable computer cable okay
then you've got a power brick alright
that's fairly beefy looking so I'm
guessing that's how our speakers are
powered then next we find a control puck
and this is very stylish I mean that's
what their lifestyle series is all about
is maintaining that premium sound
quality while having like a stylish
exterior and stylish functionality so
here is your volume control knob and you
can see actually this is functionality
that I love I love having a headphone
port right on the front because it's a
quick easy way to switch between
headphones and the actual speakers and
that is a nice solid knob it's made out
of some kind of solid material feels
good when you turn it like it feels like
an old receiver rather than feeling like
a piece of plastic that's just kind of
stuck onto something so this plugs in by
serial okay probably to the back
but we'll find out more about that later
okay here you will find the speaker's
themselves okay so these are the two
speakers something that you'll notice
about Edifier speakers is that they
always feel weight heavier than the
competition in any given price range so
despite the fact that these are like a
lifestyle speaker and I realize I'm
using that word a lot but it should be
emphasized they are still quite solid
feeling so you can actually I believe
you can take off the front here but I
could be mistaken so I'll better not try
too hard okay there we go
so you can actually take the front
covers off these speakers and you know
are you supposed to do that hard to say
no I don't think you're supposed to do
that does that background there we go
okay so that snaps right back into place
Esther's looking looking on and shock
and awe as I do that okay so look at
that speakers close-up camera person are
you can you hear close-up really I find
that very surprising
okay so Bose plug in via three
thirty-five millimeter jack okay so then
we have our power cable that plugs into
our power brick and let's get further
along into the unboxing so all you're
gonna find at the bottom here is the
subwoofer
okay the subwoofer is a very important
part of any 2.1 system it is the point
one and that is what is going to give
you all of the kicks that you get out of
that speaker system so just get this out
okay blow it off okay so on the top
you'll find a metal stylized
power button okay so that's like a
brushed aluminum surrounded in a glossy
black alright then this is the front of
the subwoofer so you can see what the
whole setup is meant to look like when
it's all together so it's kind of too
slim towers and then like a triangular
looking subwoofer okay in terms of
connectivity actually why don't we start
with a close look down this kind of this
gap right here so you can see this is a
down firing subwoofer so there are
technical reasons for that although I
couldn't tell you exactly what they are
but it is supposed to produce a more
desirable sound as far as bass is
concerned and even some speakers
actually the Makos which I've boxed
recently use all downward firing
speakers on the back you have a bass
control knob you also have the port that
gets the data from the control knob and
then we also have a line in a speaker
out and a 1.8 volt in so that's your
power input thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the Edifier multimedia
3300 life styled speakers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
