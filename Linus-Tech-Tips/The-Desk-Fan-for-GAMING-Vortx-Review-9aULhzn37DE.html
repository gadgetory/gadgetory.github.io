more immersed in their games vibration
inducing bodysuits omnidirectional
treadmills headphones with pinpoint
location accurate sounds these gadgets
promise to take us deeper into the
worlds we love but there has never been
something quite like the vortex 4d
environmental simulator Wow I mean look
at this it's actually blowing air at him
like in the game so how is it Riley are
you immersed my eyes are kind of dry
okay
yeah let's talk about that
antlion audios new mod mic wireless
features low latency high recording
quality LED status indicators up to 12
hours of battery life and more check it
out at the link in the video description
so this curious device comes to us
courtesy of a company called whirlwind
FX and it's called the vortex it's
supposed to increase game or video
immersion by blowing air at your face
which may not be quite as stupid as it
sounds so to differentiate their product
from just a USB powered desk fan the air
stream actually changes in intensity and
even in temperature depending on the
audio and video playing on your PC with
the basic idea being that if you see
like a snowy scene you'll feel blustery
gusts of wind and if there's a fiery
explosion you'll feel a hot blast so uh
Riley how'd that work well so there's an
intake fan at the back air is deflected
with a plate to either pass through a
heating element inside or to avoid it
before exiting through this beautiful
front nozzle now the vortex has a
desktop app that uses what whirlwind
Effects calls the e^x algorithm to
monitor and analyze the audio waveform
which informs the intensity of the wind
blast the video meanwhile informs how
hot or cold the air will be the orange
and red in fire and explosions translate
to heat while bluish colors translate to
cold I mean that's really cool but you
didn't actually tell you does it work I
mean sort of you you should probably try
for yourself to be honest ok yeah get in
here alright I'm ready to get immersed
oh yeah get in Myrtle ok so this is what
kind of smells like electronics your
referee yeah I thought that would go
away really it smells like one of those
cheap heaters you know so this is not a
great first impression
all right I'm gonna I'm opening up my
mind okay I'm closing these earphones
and opening up my mind so this is their
demo video this is the demo video and it
works like as soon as you make something
fullscreen then the e ex algorithm will
start like okay now it's analyzed okay
so this is best-case scenario this is
best-case scenario according to the
makers of the vortex I've got to give
credit where credit is due
yeah does feel more like I am outside
right right and I watch this part watch
this part that slows down - slows down
in slow motion then it gets going again
oh oh wipeout sort of there is
definitely a legitimate difference in in
feeling yeah this should be blasting
past your heads oh yeah hugely like it's
just kind of a gentle breeze I mean a
gentle breeze is better than nothing
that's true very true in much the same
way that you know force feedback through
her controller was considered
revolutionary for gaming even though
obviously you know a slap shot feels
different from array you know it's like
it's blowing only at one side of my face
though hmm yeah yeah part of the problem
okay okay so clearly the solution is two
of them
my eyes are drying out though I've only
been here for like three minutes yeah
how does Batman fight Superman that's
stupid okay
Batman has and he's dead now he's human
yeah again it's not really picking up on
the correct intensity because yeah it
kind of relies on the movement of the
screen itself and it's just kind of
going yeah you're outside there's
probably a breeze I do hear can't try an
actual game yeah okay so I'm getting air
blown at me whoa some warm air blown at
me that lots of warmness yep I'm running
along there's some air blowing up okay
I'm standing next to fire starting in
the fire don't kill yourself getting a
little hotter do you feel like you're
actually fighting demons
he'll infested Mars the smell is kind of
distracting I mean it kind of smells
like burning I don't feel like there's a
strong connection between the airbursts
right the action on the screen and that
can almost make it feel like you you're
reminded that you're not in the game
world you're sitting at a desk with
pretending to be the doom guy you're not
actually the doom guy you know you know
my mouth I am the doom guy okay
hey that's fine man you live your life
so is this the part where you make fun
of my rocket League skills no there was
some wind Wow see that's kind of
interesting when when when the explosion
when you get your goal it's like it blew
a thing at me so watch this watch it a
little bit yeah love the vortex embrace
the vortex now it's time to really enter
the matrix states immerse yourself that
matrix reference is so so now and edgy
well what are you ready player ready
player one I'm just gonna I've actually
never played the skinny before um
yeah throw it yeah um grab that bat back
you got to go slower man go slower why
would I go slower because time moves as
fast as you do it's like a just
but there you go I can't believe I've
never played this game no the doodad is
not contributing in any meaningful way
whatsoever maybe part of it is that I'm
standing further than you were yeah it's
not mine but also you said you felt it
it's not super or hot and this is this
is consistent with what so in response
to my own question does the vortex
increase immersion well it does
something does something the first time
you watch a video or play a game there's
you're you're gonna have all whoa cool
moment or like maybe uh whoa warm breeze
moment and it's at its best when there's
a sudden change in scenery that's
accompanied by a blast of air and there
are more than one moments when it
actually works pretty well but the
issues that we found that while actually
gaming like not just watching the vortex
demo reel 2018 whirlwinds detection
engine just isn't smart enough to tell
the difference between stepping out of a
cave into the icy air and flipping on a
light switch so it mostly translates
into bursts of air being sent at your
head every time you move your view from
side to side which maybe makes a little
bit of sense there's like a little bit
of wind on my face my hair the issue is
that for every time the wind syncs up
with what's happening on screen there
are three to seventeen instances where
it doesn't like an event will occur
where you would expect to have a
corresponding blast of warm or cold air
and it's not there and then other times
you'll feel air on your face when you
shouldn't like when you're driving a car
flying an aircraft also I should hope
that you don't feel air on your face
when you're in a Starfighter because
then something is definitely wrong
because you're in space yeah so yeah for
the most part it just feels like gaming
with
like an oscillating fan that's blowing
at you from one side which can actually
cause a bit of cognitive dissonance when
the explosion is happening over on the
other side since the vortex is supposed
to make gaming more immersive I guess
one thing we haven't addressed yet is
motion sickness so the feeling of motion
sickness is apparently caused by a
mismatch between what a player is
experiencing in game and in real life so
Ansel one of our editors here gets
motion sickness from using VR normally
so we had him playing a racing game with
the vortex and his verdict it might be a
little better and then for comparison's
sake we hadn't played the game again
with a regular fan blowing at him and he
said that that was just as good bummer
looks like they probably could have
saved themselves some R&amp;amp;D now for the
sake of science since the vortex
apparently uses colors to inform the
wind temperature to a certain degree we
wondered whether we could game the
system by displaying full screen solid
colors so what we did what is just bring
up a full screen you know light blue
solid color but switching between light
blue and orange didn't consistently
change the temperature instead like
before we simply got a burst of air
whenever the screen changed so air
temperature does change between hot and
cold when an actual scene is displayed
so there does seem to be some aspect of
the algorithm that informs that change
other than just color so maybe that's
whirlwind FX's actual end game to use
the vortex as a development tool to
continue to refine their sensing
technology something that does have
potential like I've done this bird
simulator thing in VR where the changing
fan blowing in front of you really
affects the way that you perceive your
rate of movement through the air but it
should be noted that that's with a
custom-built experience like there's a
whole rig that you strap yourself into
with a game that's specifically built
for it and it's unlikely that we're
gonna see
that kind of integration with mainstream
games anytime soon
so should you get this for me I'm gonna
say no not unless you've got a hundred
and twenty bucks burning a hole in your
pocket and you just desperately need
some kind of air ejection device to put
it out Riley do you have any closing
thoughts no sorry can't talk I'm too
immersed right now I'm very immersed
