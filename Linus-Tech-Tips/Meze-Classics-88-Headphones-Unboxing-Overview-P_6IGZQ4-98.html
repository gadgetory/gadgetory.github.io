now to learn more welcome to an unboxing
of something I am super super stoked on
these are the meze classics 88 I got
them in the satin finish however they
are available in either satin or glossy
and much like the in years so those were
the Elevens these use a real woodgrain
finish in order to achieve what is a
very unique very well classic look as
well as according to reviews that I've
checked out so far although I haven't
had an extensive amount of time with
them yet at all
pretty darn decent sounds so it's one
thing to pick up a pair of fashion
headphones knowing what you're getting
yourself into
and that their fashion headphones it's
quite another to get something that
looks outstanding and also sounds really
great so it comes with a meze sticker
just like that okay
pretty straightforward comes with a
removable breakaway cable that also
includes a three and a half two quarter
inch Jack there you go so much for
metric right so there you go so it
includes either you can plug it in
directly two three and a half mil or you
can plug in the adapter it screws in so
it's nice and secure and then look at
this guy so even here on the three and a
half mil it's got a woodgrain finish
just like that so remember every one of
these is going to be slightly unique and
then they're on the other end you can
see again it's got a wood green finish
to it absolutely beautiful love it and
then the headphones themselves so
they're packed in a nice soft foam which
i think is going to make it pretty
difficult for them to get damaged in
shipping they've got a bit of a unique
sort of system for mounting to your head
one that I haven't really used
extensively before so you can see they
fit perfectly into there and that is
like this so adjustments are not really
something that you do with this so it
gives them a bit of a lightweight frame
so they just use two bars here that have
a metal core and then kind of a rubber
outside and then these guys right here
are
meant to sit on your head wherever they
will so they articulate here just like
that and then they also articulate right
here so the idea is that once you put
them on okay so they they kind of extend
and change the shape of the headset so
it should fit your ears just fine now it
kind of works for me one thing I notice
about them immediately however is
because it doesn't use a full sized
headband its squeezing in on my head a
little bit
however these pads right here you can
see that they use a very they don't use
like a memory foam or anything like that
so they use a bit of a harder foam so
what I'm expecting is a bit of a
breaking period before these really sit
on my head really nicely so my HD 5 v 5
from Sennheiser were quite similar they
didn't use a soft foam they used a bit
of a harder foam so upon initially
putting them on they weren't that
comfortable but once they break in and
once you're the only one who wears these
for an extended period of time that foam
is nice and thick and I'm expecting it
to sit there quite comfortably they're
extremely lightweight in spite of the
wood construction which obviously weighs
more than plastic which is what you'll
find on most headphones these days even
very high-end headphones which is a bit
of a bizarre thing to me it should be
noted however that wood does change the
acoustic characteristics of the headset
you can expect a bit of a warmer sound
they fit on top of the ears so rather
than actually even though they're
they're larger style headphones they sit
well ok I think I already said they sit
on top of your ears rather than
completely around them this is something
I'm not really used to but hopefully
I'll be able to give you guys my
impressions maybe on our weekly live
stream the LAN show at some point let
you know what I think of them once I've
really had more time to spend with them
but I want to show you guys just a
little bit more glam here of the
interconnect so here on the ear cup is
where you plug in the breakaway cable
very very nice finish to the cord to the
braids on the court as well so that's
not going to get snagged on anything and
it should make it reasonably cat
resistant I did have a problem with that
with a pair of Sun highs RPC 350s that
were destroyed by Rumble and he was a
kitten
anyway meze logos on either side and
then you can see that there's also
another articulation point here these
actually flip all the way around which
could be could be confusing if they're
both kind of like that and you don't
have the cord plugged in or whatever and
you're like oh well it is weird how do I
get it to actually face my ear well the
answer is like this so what we see
revealed when we move those away though
our airports up here so these are going
to be designed to optimize base response
so without any porting whatsoever you're
gonna find most headphones are not going
to deliver that that base that people
really do demand but I like what they've
done seeing where you can see that
there's a bit of a gap here so that
those ports aren't going to be totally
useless but they also haven't put them
on the bottom of the Year cups so
they're completely invisible and all you
really see is the gorgeous woodgrain
finish so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the classics 88 from meze

know what you think of these would you
rather have something that just plain
costs less and isn't made out of wood or
do you feel a little bit better having
you know a nice pair of headphones
hanging off of your headphone holder
next to your desk and do you like the
feeling of wearing something that's a
little bit unique just even if it's a
bit of a different woodgrain finish
versus anything else that's out there
