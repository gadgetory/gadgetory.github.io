Intel's new skylake processors and now
they're finally here which means it's
time for an overclocking guide so today
will not only be running through the
benefits and risks of overclocking as
usual we'll also be showing you some new
features of the skylake platform that
could make fine-tuning your shiny new
rig a little bit easier than ever before
you
so first off we need to answer that
question new PC builders and even some
experienced ones have been asking
themselves since time immemorial what
the heck is overclocking and why do we
want to do it well the idea behind
overclocking is pretty simple it's just
the process of tuning your hardware to
make it run faster than its original
specification many parts of a system can
be overclocked including the CPU video
card rant and even your monitor but the
most common target for people who want
to tinker is the CPU and that's we'll be
focusing on today but keep in mind guys
that overclocking isn't just a matter of
cranking up a virtual vial and expecting
everything to automatically run smoothly
there are some possible drawbacks more
power consumption and heat output system
instability a shortening of the lifespan
of your process or even but while there
are never any guarantees with
overclocking the benefits are that it
can substantially improve your
computer's performance particularly in
CPU bound programs which can include
everything from image and video editing
software to demanding video games some
of which are actually relatively CPU
bound and can see real performance gains
from a faster CPU with all that said
then let's get down to it today we're
going to be looking at intel's all-new
core i7 6700 k skylake processor running
at a four gigahertz stock speed with a
turbo boost clock of up to 4.2 gigahertz
and like other LGA 1150 whatever core
i7s the 6700 K has four physical cores
and eight threads with hyper-threading
you also get the standard complement of
PCI Express Lanes so you got sixteen
either sixteen individually or 8x8 X for
your graphics cards and then four more
that go through the new version of
intel's direct media interface DMI 3.0
that links the CPU to the chipset at
around four gigabytes per second twice
the speed of the last few chipset
generations but there are a few really
special things about skylake that should
be very enticing to both novice and
advanced overclockers first of all early
tests suggest that skylake provides a
much more
distant overclocking experience then has
well which had a reputation for varying
greatly from chip to chip so while
obviously not every skylake chip will be
exactly the same it looks like you may
not need to worry as much about losing
the silicon lottery as you did in the
past
second sky lik offers a much more
flexibility with a key setting that can
let you hit very specific frequencies
I'm talking of course about the
processor base clock in the past the
base clock affected the speed not only
of the CPU but of other system buses
like SATA and PCI Express which could
lead to data loss from your storage
devices when overclocked by more than
even a couple of megahertz not a
worthwhile trade-off for a slightly
faster SuperPi time well not so with
skylake if you're feeling particularly
daring you'll have much more flexibility
to play around with the base clock to
squeeze every last drop of performance
out of your system more on that later
third power efficiency has been much
improved to the point that higher
overclock should now be possible without
investing in a super expensive
motherboard in the past enthusiasts
would you know lust after boards with 8
12 or even 16 power phases what do to
skylights low power consumption a good
motherboard with this few as four phases
can give you a great overclock meaning
that you won't have to shell out tons of
money for the beefiest motherboard you
can buy instead focusing on buying one
that has the right features for you
things like onboard Wi-Fi for example so
with that out of the way let's jump into
it and have a look at the rest of our
test setup
remember that skylake primarily supports
ddr4 Ram so we're using 16 gigs of a
data xpg ddr4 memory running at 2400
megahertz
with a mere 1.2 volts our CPU and RAM
are sitting on the Asus e170 deluxe and
although it might lack some of the
eye-popping bells and whistles of the
rog series boards the deluxe packs
plenty of features some even designed
specifically for overclocking like a
dedicated water-pump header for total
control over your CPU cooling and the
ability to completely customize the
speeds of both your DC and PWM fans with
export in the BIOS including a new
setting that prevents rapid fan speed
changes which can be distracting mm-hmm
and for those of you who like a little
more flash you can also use the
adjustable RGB lighting on the chipset
cooler that can even change in real time
according to CPU temperatures or
whatever music is playing in your PC
there's also like key Express which
allows you to assign macro functionality
to normal Keys on a standard keyboard
was just kind of neat and yeah I guess
that's pretty much it solid board
rounding out our test setup we used a
cooler master Neptune to ADL closed-loop
cooler with dual 140 millimeter fans to
keep our shiny new CPU from overheating
when we're pumping the juice through it
and then finally a cooler master v6 50
power supply rated at 80 plus gold
efficiency and featuring us on the
modular power supplied so let's get
started power on your rig and start
spamming either delete or f2 to get into
the Zeus UEFI BIOS the settings that
you'll be working with are in Advanced
Mode which you can get to easily by
hitting f7 immediately once you're there
select AI Tweaker at the top of the
screen to bring up a buttload of
settings related to overclocking go
ahead and dial in XMP so that your RAM
will run at its rated speed and voltage
then have a look at the CPU core ratio
this setting controls the CPU multiplier
which is the most straightforward way to
overclock although it only works on
unlocked that is K or extreme edition
processors on the intel side and it's
usually the safest your cpu speed is
actually the result of multiplying its
base clock which is typically 100 by
default by a multiplier so for example
our CPU runs at 4 gigahertz in stock
with a 100 megahertz base clock and a
default multiplier of 40 for the skylake
core i7 i recommend starting at 4.5
gigahertz and working your way up so for
now select sync all course to make sure
that all of your processing cores are
running at the same speed you can also
assign different numbers per core later
but it's harder to stress test and only
really improves performance in programs
that use one or two cores it's kind of
like customized turbo boost alright so
once you've keyed in the multiplier that
you want
scroll down to CPU core voltage
and switch it over to manual mode for
stress testing an overclocked manual
mode allows your CPU to run at near
constant voltage but once you've
validated your overclock a popular
choice is to set it to adaptive mode for
everyday use so that you're not running
the full voltage through the CPU when
it's just idling which can reduce its
lifespan although most processors are
capable of slight overclocks on stock
voltage any serious overclocking will
require you to give the CPU a little bit
more juice or voltage our i7 shipped
with a stock bullet of around 1.2 volts
but your mileage may vary on that one so
have a look at what it runs at stock but
then regardless of that overclocking
voltages should be somewhere in the 1.2
to 1.4 range I would keep it below 1.4
for
wouldn't go much higher than about 1.4 2
volts so key in the voltage you want to
start with and press Enter when you're
all done save your settings and boot
into Windows from there you can bring up
the stress testing applications of your
choice so here at the office we use a
Sioux Cesaro G real bench and I 264 for
CPU validation I 264 also allows
real-time monitoring of CPU voltages and
temperatures which is why you want to
keep those voltages as low as you can
while retaining stability because the
higher the voltage the higher the
temperature and while real bench is free
I 264 is not after the trial so programs
like HW monitor and CPU Z are good no
cost alternatives to keep an eye on
numbers during your testing after you've
got your software up and running run a
stress test for about 15 minutes and
watch for any system instability this
will come in the form of blue screens of
death random shutdowns freezes or
sometimes your testing program actually
just telling you hey your system is
unstable and if none of those things
happen congratulations go back into the
BIOS and try pushing the multiplier up a
little bit further if your system did
crash though try giving your CPU a
little more voltage being sure not to
push it outside of a safe range once you
get the multiplier as high as it can go
while maintaining a reasonable core
voltage of course go ahead and run a
longer stress test to ensure stability
over the long
I mean you don't want to decide
everything is okay after a few minutes
only to have your PC crashed during a
crucial moment two weeks later it's also
a good idea to use more than one program
for validation we've had over clocks
pass stress tests in I 264 but then
crash within a minute or two in real
bench which can be it can stress in
different parts of the CPU differently a
good approach is to stress test on real
bench for at least four hours then I'd
say do at least a 24 hour validation on
Ida 64 or another program if you'd like
so don't plan on using your PC for a
while quick note though a lot of people
still use prime95
for stress testing we don't recommend
the newer versions of it there are
actually power viruses which are
programs that can push so hard that you
can actually damage your hardware so
keep an eye on that now other things to
keep an eye on temperatures I have
alluded to this but I haven't really
given a solid guideline for me
personally the comfort zone is anywhere
from the 80 to 85 degree mark once you
start getting there the long-term
lifespan of your chip can be affected so
that's why investing in a quality CPU
heatsink is so important for
overclocking now although we're using a
280 millimeter radiator all in one you
can actually get just as good results a
lot of the time with a large air cooler
just make sure that you're not using
like the Box heatsink or something like
that I mean maybe that's why they
stopped including them with k-series
overclockable chips outright so results
time using this procedure we were able
to achieve a rock-solid overclock of 0.7
gigahertz using 1.3 to 5 volts under
load our maximum temperature stayed
around 75 degrees Celsius and our test
system drew around 330 watts from the
wall during real bench's stress test but
even if you get good you know clock
speed numbers like we did it's a good
idea to run some real world style
benchmarks as well and not just stress
test programs like Cinebench pc mark or
even your favorite games can be very
useful for determining a if the system
really is stable like really really
and also how much performance you even
gained with your overclock if everything
looks good but you want to tweak your
speeds a little bit more tuning your
base clock might be the way to go as I
mentioned earlier with skylake you now
have the freedom to tune your base clock
to a much greater extent than you did
before so we were actually able to crank
our base clock all the way up to 200
megahertz which with a CPU multiplier of
23 gave us a very solid overclock of 4.6
gigahertz using the same voltage as we
did when we adjusted the multiplier only
and with similar thermals and power draw
do keep in mind though that playing with
the base clock is a little bit more
complicated because while PCIe has been
detached from it it still does affect
your RAM speeds so if you're
experiencing freezes and crashes after
overclocking your base clock go back
into the BIOS and have a look at your
memory settings certain memory dividers
are often inherently more stable than
others
and it's also important to pay attention
to ensure that your RAM isn't running at
a speed way beyond its specifications
after you adjusted the base clock
providing a little more voltage through
advanced settings called system agent
and VC C IO might be helpful in these
cases and but for our test setup we
found that keeping the RAM in its rated
speed of 20 400 megahertz gave us a
stable overclock without having to
really change any voltages and I
personally find memory overclocking to
be the most difficult to do stable e
because RAM errors can take a really
long time to manifest and show up at the
worst possible time so in general I
recommend just leaving them alone
alright to Linus you've thrown a ton of
information here but what if I don't
have the time to tinker with voltages
and validate for two days and all that
kind of stuff surely there has to be an
easier way
never fear most motherboard
manufacturers offer a more you know
one-click overclock option of some sort
and a soos is no exception head into the
BIOS and you'll find the easy tuning
wizard where all you have to do is
indicate what you'll be using your PC
for and what kind of cooler you have and
it will apply an overclocking setting
automatically the drawback is that you
typically won't get the same performance
as you would with a manual overclock as
the board will try to
apply safer settings that may be
necessary bar motherboard gave us an
overclock of just about 4.6 gigahertz
with 1.3 volts definitely not too shabby
but not quite as good as our manual
process alternatively you can use a
ceases AI suite which is available on
their website or on the disk that came
with your motherboard and selecting
extreme tuning and turning off frequency
and voltage targets will cost the
software to push the CPU as far as it
can go though when we tried this it
tried to take our skylight processor
past 5 gigahertz and then completely
refused to boot so and then set a target
of 4.8 which seemed to work but the CPU
actually ran below 4.7 K anyway the
point is we recommend the idea that the
manual the manual process and that gave
us the best results which pretty much
wraps this up so if you followed along
I hope you've gotten an overclock that
will be the envy of all your friends or
at least the ones who know what
overclocking is don't stop tinkering
