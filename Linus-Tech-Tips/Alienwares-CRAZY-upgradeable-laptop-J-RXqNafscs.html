D brand their prism screen protectors
and grip cases protect your phone that's
pretty much all there is to it check
them out at the link in the video
description so let me put it this way
this is the Alienware
area 51 m and in the words of our
Alienware rep which if he wasn't such a
nice guy who's very credible i would
find very hard to believe
yes linus it has a full in core i 999
hundred k processor in and I went really
because everything that I know about
size and heat and how much you need to
get rid of how much of it a ninety nine
hundred K would produce would indicate
that that sort of thing would be
basically impossible and that's even
ignoring the rest of the completely
over-the-top specs of this thing so it's
can be equipped with up to a an RT X xx
atti graphics card with six gigs of Gd
dr six memory that's GD r six right yes
it's got what I'm assuming dual nvme
boot drives in raid 0 do you have a two
and a half inch expansion driving here
surely not that's two and a half inch
drive in here okay it's it's cut at
1080p 144 Hertz panel which might not be
that impressive today but it's thin
bezel and there's a plan for later this
year to upgrade it to 240 Hertz and
they've done all of this within like I
would say a fairly slim desktop
replacement form factor but it gets even
crazier because while desktop
replacements are kind of a replacement
for the performance of a desktop they
have never been a replacement for the
upgrade ability of a desktop and that is
where they really surprised me they're
actually gonna allow me to open this so
I need my toolkit where to go got it
and they're gonna let us crack it open
to see how they have achieved
upgradeable graphics on this machine
actually we're gonna move over here
so a couple things jump out at us right
away that's a 90 watt hour battery so in
spite of the size we are still getting
right up against the limit to what you
are allowed to put in a laptop in order
for it to be able to be carried on an
airplane there's that two and a half
inch drive bay that we talked about
before they somehow managed to put four
dimm slots on the bloody thing even
though with 32 gig dims up coming that's
not even entirely necessary we've got em
got 2 expansion slot right here number
one and then I don't see number two
here's an MDOT 2.5 something label I
don't know what that's to do with but I
guess we'll find the other one a little
bit later and we've got cooling fans I
think we're gonna have to go deeper so
Dell says I actually won't need help
with that because they've provided a
handy-dandy little key here for all the
screws that I need in order to remove
this what what is this called again
ok the ribcage ok cool so we need 14 L
eights here we go one do okay so now
we're pulling off this back shroud here
that covers up the rear i/o as well as
these incredibly beefy looking heat
sinks so you can see they've got support
for their external graphics not that
there's anything much more powerful than
what's already in here external display
Ethernet dual power inputs because hey
that's the thing let's go ahead and
remove some more screws get that rib
cage off so we're just connecting the
battery now this is an important first
step so we just pulled this appears to
be what the display output for the
built-in display I don't know I'm kind
of guessing at this point but we're
actually getting very close to being
able to get a better look at where we're
going with this here
okay so these Wi-Fi antennas do I need
to pop these off it looks like I might
be able to hold on a second hmm this one
no this one's got to go shoot harddrive
okay this one we're good that's when I'm
getting caught but it's on with this I
think we're good on that this guy's
gotta go webcam oh we're getting close I
can feel it
oh this hard drive cable management
actually has to come out there we go
whoa these Wi-Fi antennas we may end up
needing to remove those but not a
hundred percent sure yet I think that's
all that's holding us in right now yep
okay well there goes the cable
management for that sorry guys if it
helps at all I feel really really bad no
I don't that was a lie there's lies
damned lies and then there's what I just
said then there it is so this right here
thank you so this right here is the
secret sauce so here is and this is not
a standard desktop socket did you guys
create this socket standard this is a
standard socket under here it looks so
low-profile you're sure right no yeah
the the LGA standard yes but this
retention mechanism this is not standard
it's a veritable bounty of exciting tech
things so first of all I don't know what
I was expecting
well I do know what I was expecting
because we've seen desktop processors in
laptops before and typically they have
just used the same mounting mechanism as
desktop motherboards because it's a lot
of work to engineer your own and Dell
actually the folks that I'm talking to
here don't actually know if they made
their own mounting mechanism but I can
tell you right now that that is not a
standard one and
so that would lead me to believe that it
is entirely possible that they have
actually created their their own hold
down for it here now the LGA itself so
that's the little socket that the CPU
sits into that is standard so
theoretically there is nothing that
would prevent someone from buying a
lower-end processor out of the gate and
then actually upgrading it down the road
a service that Dell plans to provide
either themselves like you'll have to
pay extra obviously but where they come
to your house and install it for you or
as a kit that you can actually do by
yourself this is a really different way
of thinking about laptops you're coming
out baby yeah you are you want to yeah I
got it all right here we go
I was totally wrong so it's just this
arm that's been changed I guess they
just wanted to save a little bit space
here so how does a standard desktop
socket and check this out so all these
thermal pads around here those are for
the vrm because as you can imagine
cramming the right kind of power
delivery for this is a like intel has 95
watt processors and then they have 95
watt processors cramming the kind of
power delivery you need for a proper
desktop cpu into something like this is
not trivial and of course you're gonna
need all of that cooled by the same heat
pipes beefy fans and beefy heat sinks
that you have for the CPU itself but
this this right here is the proverbial
money shot because I think that most
people over the next few years are not
really gonna need to upgrade a core I
nine ninety nine hundred K for gaming
but the graphics cards those keep moving
and that's where you're gonna see you
know a 30% or 40% uplift and performance
generation over generation that is as
long as Nvidia has their way and this is
the piece that Dell says they would like
obviously bad stuff can happen the spec
could change to such a degree that it's
impossible but that they would like to
be user upgradeable in the future now if
you're familiar with milk book graphics
you will already know that this is not
and mxm module so that was the previous
standard for upgradeable or modular
graphics and laptops but Nvidia in their
infinite wisdom is trying to kill it or
not trying to kill it they have killed
it so Dell actually leaned on the
engineering prowess of their precision
team to just go well if you're not going
to support the standard then damn it I
guess we'll do it ourselves so the idea
here is that you could remove this with
a couple of screws and not only you
remove this right here and not only
would you be able to change the
performance you could even change the
outputs on this thing so you could
support future display standards like
HDMI 2.1 for example pretty flippin cool
now all that's left is to leave you guys
to put this back together because I've
got another appointment thank you guys
and also to tell you guys about our
sponsor D brands B brand is sponsoring
our trip here to CES 2019 their grip
cases as you can imagine it very grippy
its line is proof because otherwise
realistically they wouldn't let me
endorse it and it's got their super
clicky buttons as well as their
trademark customizability so you got
your precision cut true texture 3 on
vinyl skins and pretty much any color
you could want
the other big thing this year is their
prism screen protectors they've got an
applicator so it goes on super easily
you got a perfect fit every time and the
impact resistance of this thing is quite
frankly it's you have to see it to
believe it you put this thing on you
hammer a nail into a piece of wood with
the face of your phone you take off the
prism you've got a dented ass prism but
you've got a pristine screen it's pretty
much unreal you can check them both out
at the link in the video description so
thanks for watching guys we are on our
way to the next suite here at CES 2019
