than once burn the midnight oil looking
at stormtrooper armor online and
waffling over the purchase
it's either quite expensive or it's a
lot of work usually both and one of
those things where you're unlikely to
make the decision lightly
with its factory tuning and data center
DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts personally I
couldn't justify it for cosplay since I
really just don't get out that much
which means that the wearability of the
armor was less of a concern for me than
the collectability of it but I'd also
feel stupid for buying a full life-size
kit of collectible armor that I can't
actually wear so in an ideal world I
would want both and the place I always
ended up at was original stormtrooper
comm which is run by Andrew Ainsworth of
shepherdson design studios yes the
makers of the stormtrooper costumes
among other things from Star Wars a new
hope they've got affordable stuff in
their battle spec lineup but the one
that I always really lusted after was
the original line the website boasts
that the original line is made from the
highest quality materials and is
suitable for display or for trooping but
most importantly to a collector the
original line is hand made by the
original prop maker himself
Andrew Ainsworth oh and they're signed
to so having spent a fair amount of time
on their site when those guys reached
out to me out of the freakin blue and
said hey we'll send you a full set of
everything armor helmet boots blaster
and all you have to do is film a guide
on how to put it on I just about crapped
my pants
which is nothing compared to my reaction
when it finally arrived something we
actually had the pleasure of capturing
live I can't promise that on that
occasion no pants crapping occurred so
having cleaned myself up and calmed down
a little bit I've collected everything
together and it's time to get started
now I've unboxed a lot of really cool
stuff in my day
but in spite of the DIY packaging this
was among my best unboxing experiences
ever
the meticulous care that went into
protecting each piece the discovery of
each signature as I went through the
packaging and even the manual itself was
an experience I mean do you guys
remember when manuals were one of the
most fun things about getting a new
video game
they'd have instructions some great
illustrations and concept art they'd
have some cool lore and maybe a note
from the lead game designer well this
one really took me back I think the
inkjet printing and hand bound
construction actually add to the
experience of reading about the humble
origins of the project and help you
appreciate the preservation of the
original molds that these pieces are
made from even more the armor was made
for a 165 pound 5 foot 10 inch person
but the website says it can fit anyone
from about 5 6 - 6 - I'm at the very
bottom of that range so I weigh about
145 pounds so we'll see how it goes
suiting up can sort of be done alone but
if you have a friend to help you it's a
lot faster and easier you start with the
black bodysuit and at this point I would
recommend laying out all of the pieces
where you can reach them easily without
bending over
if you're going to gear yourself up the
abdominal front and back have adjustable
straps that go over the shoulders and
cross over in the front with velcro
straps on either side for narrowing the
gap between them for shoes the pimp 50
model from Fantasma is popular because
Shepperton design studios doesn't
actually provide shoes and I'd recommend
putting these shoes on now
before the calf and thigh armor starting
with the calves for each piece open the
velcro at the back identify which side
of the body it goes on red dots for the
right green dots for the left then clamp
them onto your legs you should adjust
the velcro overlays for the tightest
possible fit the thighs are then
attached to the abdominal front with the
included snaps that hang down the chest
and upper back comes assembled in the
box so you just slide it over your head
then fastened at the sides with the
velcro straps the shoulder bail and
bicep molding are suspended from the
chest piece with two more snap fasteners
on each side again you're going to want
to make sure that you're watching the
color-coding or it's not going to fit
together correctly the forearms clamp on
like the legs but make sure that you're
optimizing the velcro here for comfort
as well as tightness the kit includes
gloves in my case rubber dishwashing
ones that have hand Armour on the back
but I think I'll get some leather gloves
to use for this instead in the long run
and the good news is that because
they're just attached with Velcro you
can easily swap the armor pieces onto
something else the shoulder straps can
now be adjusted to ensure that they
overlap the front of Domino's section
well and now it is time for the
finishing touches wrap the belt around
with the two hanging pieces down then
cover the overlap at the back by
clipping on your thermal detonator
canister the finishing touches are the
blaster and the helmet the blaster is an
authentic replica made in the same way
as the stormtrooper blasters from a new
hope it uses castings from sterling
submachine gun parts includes a power
pack and is personalized with a unique
serial number it's made from lightweight
composite materials so carrying your 11
around all day is no problem when you're
not keeping it on the display stand that
comes with the collector edition the
helmet is available in a few styles I
opted for the Hero version worn by the
leading actors that is handmade and
detailed and come signed by Andrew
Ainsworth but the other premium option a
signature regular trooper helmet that's
actually cast from the original molds
and also hand detailed is a fine choice
as well there is a more value oriented
battle spec one that isn't handmade or
signed but is able to be delivered at a
much lower price while maintaining
Shepherdsons quality standards but I
wanted the collectability so I opted for
the signed one time to put it on if you
have a large head you may find it easier
to put the helmet on sideways then twist
it into the correct position for me I
found the helmet very big and I had to
get a
a bit creative with some foam pieces in
order to get a more snug fit so this is
the part where I talk about the overall
fitting finish out of the box and during
the gearing up process
I was excited but I had a hard time
picturing how these pieces of funny
well plastic could really make me feel
like a stormtrooper once it all comes
together though it's hard to imagine
they were wearing anything else on the
set of the movies which you won't have
to because this is pretty much it I had
one complaint about my experience with
the armor and it was that for the first
time in my life you know I don't really
have any self-image issues or anything I
wished that I was about four inches
taller and that it fit me perfectly but
if I can't feel more like a stormtrooper
at least I can feel like Mark Hamill
getting burned by Carrie Fisher or
something like that that's all right by
me now some of the stuff I'm showing
here is extra like the bust the holster
the neck guard and actually the 11th
Blaster but that's the beauty of what
original stormtrooper comm is doing
their stuff is only to go together so
your battle spec line armor will still
color match your more expensive original
line helmet if you want to mix and match
if you do decide to take the plunge guys
let me know and post a picture on the
Linus tech tips forum if you can it up
in your Armour because at that point you
are a certified gink badass you can find
full pricing and availability for all
this stuff on original stormtrooper comm
and I'd like to extend a huge thanks to
the folks there for sending me this
amazing piece of memorabilia I will
absolutely treasure it forever and
thanks to you guys for watching the
video like it if you liked it dislike it
if you disliked it and leave a comment
letting us know if you think we should
do more stuff like this maybe it's I
mean it's a little bit less techy but
it's definitely geek stuff oh and we
have a new t-shirt design it's a holy
balls and it's got like cats on it stuff
so you should check that out at the
merch store in the support link below
