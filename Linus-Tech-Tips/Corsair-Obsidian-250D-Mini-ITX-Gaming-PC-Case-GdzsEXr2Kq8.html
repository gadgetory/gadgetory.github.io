welcome to my unboxing and review of the
Corsair obsidian 250d a no compromises
mini ITX case so it's obsidian series
you know it's going to be well packaged
gotta like that nice soft closed cell
foam it's going to have a clean overall
aesthetic so you're not going to have
any sort of like you know vengeance c70
army green colors or anything like that
and it is going to be expected to hold
the highest tier of hardware but unlike
other obsidian cases this one is a mini
ITX enclosure so it will hold the
highest end stuff that you could
possibly expect to run in a mini ITX
case so we'll start with an overall tour
of the outside at the front we find a
full size five and a quarter inch Bay as
well as a reset switch nice little
recessed one there and a power switch
two USB 3.0 ports microphone headphone
port and the front there you go which
has a nice brushed aluminum finish is
removable giving you access to that nice
also removable fan filter here in the
front so you just go ahead and pop those
tabs down there and then it comes with a
140 millimeter fan but I believe you can
actually install up to a 160 or 200
million anyway you can install a larger
fan should you see fit on the sides you
find mesh as well as removable fan
filters on both sides so one of them has
found mounts right next to it and the
other does not
there you go magnetized fan filters so
you can pop those off clean them and
then throw them right back into place
quite easily alright which brings us to
the top where we have a window that
allows us to look down on the graphics
card CPU area and that is pretty much
about it then the other side where there
are two 120 millimeter fan notes these
can be used for air cooling or you can
actually mount a dual 120 millimeter
radiator in the case so you couple that
with the fact that you could also Jam
another radiator into the front you can
actually put a pretty decent fully
custom liquid cooling set up in here
with dual
20 and at least a 140 millimeter
radiator without running out of
clearance so let's pop off the top there
that gives us access to the inside so
there's not five and a quarter inch Bay
there's the clearance for the included
120 millimeter fan as well as a radiator
even with this uses little mini ITX
boards that have the riser PCB portion
for the power delivery you're still
going to have enough clearance but it's
really really really tight and then that
pretty much does it for the top half oh
yeah GPU length so you can install
pretty much whatever GPU you could
possibly want with the exceptions of
some really long ones like the 7990 that
one does not fit at the back we've got
little rubber grommets for a couple more
sixty millimeter fans you probably won't
need those though as well as a full-size
power supply mount and this is the first
area where courser gets a couple of
marks off from me this is not the most
solid power supply mount that I've ever
seen you pull out two thumb screws yes
two thumb screws and then this plate
comes off so it's actually only held in
by two screws on the top once you have a
power supply in there it feels not bad
but it just seems like it wouldn't have
been that much more work to put a couple
more thumb screws on there also on the
bottom by the power supply we have a
removable fan filter so you can have
your fan on the power supply on the
bottom and then finally rounding out the
back of the case we have four thumb
screws that give us access to the
internal two by two and a half
millimeter and two by three and a half
millimeter drive cages so you can mount
up to two hard drives and two SSDs or
four SSDs in this case on the removable
sleds the way that you wire them up
there is no backplane unfortunately that
would be a really really cool but also
very premium and expensive addition to
this case is simply by opening up this
side wiring them up from here and then
connecting them to the power supply
itself speaking of the power supply
itself you can put pretty much any power
supply you'd want and then the wire
management is done in the front of the
case so that's why they included that
classic fan grill for that front 140
millimeter fan let's go ahead and have a
look at an actual finished case so I did
spend some time building up a fairly
high-end gaming machine in here so I've
used an H 100 i I've got two hard drives
and one SSD although I could have easily
put in another one I'm using an ASUS
Maximus vi impact so that's pretty much
highest-end MITx case our motherboard on
the market I've also got a full-size
blu-ray drive up here so that's not a
short length one or anything like that
and I went and threw a GTX Titan as well
as an ax 1200 eye power supply so you
can see there's lots of room for the
modular interface down here even with
this long power supply and then the
cable management is tucked up here in
the front GTX Titan we've got probably
about another half an inch or even an
inch of space here but that's pretty
much as big as you can get in terms of a
graphics card and then there's lots of
room over here near the CPU socket area
for just general cable management and
cooling and everything is actually quite
clean once you've got the whole thing
installed so there were only a couple
things I noticed while I was building in
it one of them is that you actually
removed the front bezel in order to
change out the front fan I think I
changed the front fan for an LED fan or
something like that when I was doing the
build and watch this case you can go
ahead and so if you pop off the front
bezel the legs actually come off so what
happens is the whole case falls down and
I actually almost chipped my table when
I did that so that's one thing to watch
out for it's not a design flaw it's just
a design decision they made and you're
going to want to watch for it when
you're actually building in it the other
thing is optical and the h100 eye is
super super tight because of the way
that the the tubing is positioned so I'm
going to go ahead and pop the optical
drive out there we go there's a tool a
slider right here in the top oh man this
thing's heavy
right there tool a slider and because
the tubes come out like right here at
the front bringing them under the
optical like this you can see if I had a
little bit more slack they'd actually be
sticking up and they'd be pushing up on
the five and a quarter inch base so it's
quite tight but it does actually fit
even with high profile memories so I was
using Dominator Platinum's in this
particular build here the cable
management in the front is not the
tiniest thing ever but that's your
mileage may vary if you're willing to
spend the time on it you could do better
than I did and I think that's pretty
much it guys thank you for checking out
my unboxing and review of the Corsair
obsidian series 250d no compromises min
ITX gaming case don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment and let us know what you thought
of the video if you have something that
is just too complicated for a thumbs up
or a thumbs down preferably and this is
something new let us know on the forum
because we're trying to be a little bit
more active there in the discussion
threads that we create for the videos so
I'm going to go ahead and leave a link
in the video description where you can
come and discuss it and I'll actually
try to hang out there for a little while
and you know answer your questions and
talk to you guys about this particular
case because YouTube comments are just
kind of a Wild West these days I have
trouble sort of sorting through them and
seeing what was actually recent or what
wasn't and and half the people I can't
even reply to them I love that when
people post a question and then there's
no reply button because they haven't
linked their Google+ or whatever else so
yeah post post on the forum guys I'll
leave a link for you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
