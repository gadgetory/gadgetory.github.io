1.5 gigahertz with 32 megabytes of cache
meet the Knights landing xeon phi one of
the most insane CPUs in the world how
insane well how does a theoretical two
and a half tariff lock sound got no
context for that don't stress it's like
it's like a lot like like like look how
big this thing is I could take over the
world with this sort of power but first
I need to pay the bills which is why
today's video is brought to you by
tunnel bear tunnel where makes it easy
to privately and securely browse a more
open Internet tried tunnel bear for free
a tunnel bear comm /l TT
so some background information is in
order here as this is no ordinary CPU
Knights landing is the current
generation of Xeon Phi Intel's version
of what's referred to as a mini core
processor which is exactly what it
sounds like
it's built around the idea of trading
off per thread performance for an
obscene number of threads and maximum
throughput with the theory being that a
simpler scaled-down core design can
dramatically scale up in number while
still utilizing existing tools so we can
actually trace Knights landings lineage
back to project Larrabee
first unveiled in mid 2008 as a GPU
designed around the x86 architecture
Intel even announced their intent to
release a consumer graphics card version
of it back in 2010 but since nobody is
talking about dedicated team blue
graphics cards today
you should probably realize that that
never launched so zeal and Phi is what
rose from the ashes of that project
first appearing in 2012 as a PCI Express
add-in card codename Knights corner and
it actually did end up getting used in
what was the world's fastest
supercomputer until June 2016 the newest
revision though Knights landing looks a
little different it launched last year
and unlike Knights corner it works
exclusively in the LGA 3647 socket that
high-end Xeon Perley CPUs also slot into
so adding support for avx-512 and its
many extensions gives Knights landing a
lot of flexibility in its target market
so then who's the target market I'm glad
you asked
uses for this include protein folding
simulation weather prediction AI and
neural network research and development
and molecular simulation with libraries
like tensor flow and the UI you see Zen
AMD being able to take advantage of it
as well as G
you acceleration okay then - so why do
you have one
I guess because Super Micro pulled a
rookie mistake and sent it to me I mean
obviously all I was gonna do was game on
it and I'm actually kidding about that
at one point three gigahertz I can tell
you guys right now without firing up a
single benchmark what the gaming
performance will look like like that as
for productivity though yeah right out
of the gate it fell flat on its face
coming in at under half of korah nines
and nearly a third of thread rippers
score in 7-zip and Cinebench cpu mark
and reel bench not looking much better
even blender a conventionally multi-core
friendly benchmark sees terrible
performance given the 19 hundred dollar
price tag for the chip alone so know
these results won't do it all xeon phi
is clearly unlike anything we've ever
tried to benchmark before you'd need
like a PhD or something to properly
evaluate this thing which is where dr.
King horn our friend over at Puget
systems comes in as a chemist and
mathematician dr. King horn is no
stranger to high-level computation like
this and agreed to remote into our
Knights landing workstation and do some
of the testing for us while also running
his own 14 core Xeon 2690 v4 workstation
through the same suite to give us a
point of comparison the results actually
pretty surprising in Linpack the higher
core clock of the traditional Xeon gives
it an edge in smaller problem sizes but
beyond 5,000 the tables turn
dramatically with the molecular dynamics
library NAMD things seem to scale
predictably with the number of atoms
being simulated and all the tests wind
up being far less favorable to the 0 and
5 the greatest gains in this benchmark
actually come from dedicated compute
GPUs so that is fine for the phi these
days since it sits in a socket
instead of taking up valuable PCIe slots
tensorflow neural networks bring things
back though into the Xeon Phi's
wheelhouse especially in batch sizes
larger than 64 so Xeon Phi takes a
significant lead over its traditional
Xeon cousin but it should be noted that
both of them get creamed by a GPU
further highlighting the importance of
large banks of compute DP use for tasks
like these though that doesn't mean that
Xeon Phi is useless it's dramatically
better performance than a standard Xeon
makes it great for supplementing GPU
compute in workloads like these which
brings us neatly to the conclusion then
not quite as good as a GPU for tasks
that can be accelerated far better than
a traditional Xeon though in most and
finally utterly worthless for just about
anything on the Windows desktop I was
actually surprised to see Windows even
installed we ended up needing a server
version of Windows to see all the course
but that is sort of irrelevant anyway
because this is intended for use in
supercomputers we're like massive nodes
of these things can all work together to
solve complex problems along with the
banks of GPUs that accompany of them I
mean you're almost certainly not gonna
be buying anything like this personally
any time soon unless you're like that
you like to science for funsies with
that said though you yes you are very
likely to benefit from the work being
done using hardware like this and we're
glad we got the opportunity to play with
it it was fun speaking of things that
are fun it's fun to tell you guys about
Squarespace and thank them for
sponsoring this video
Squarespace has 24/7 support via live
chat so anyone can create a beautiful
functional website in just a few minutes
if all you want is like a one-page
online presence that's their cover pages
feature and they've got tons of other
great features as well including their
logo designer the ability to publish in
the Apple news format and not to mention
that the whole creation tool is
cloud-based so it's always up you can
access it
anywhere in updating your site is as
simple as like dragging over some
pictures clickety-clacking some text and
you are ready to rock
Squarespace starts at just 12 bucks a
month and you can start a trial with no
credit card required by heading to the
link in the video description
squarespace.com /l tt and when you
decide to sign up for Squarespace
forever you can use offer code LTT to
get 10% off on your first purchase so
thanks for watching guys if you dislike
this video you can hit that button but
if you liked it hit like get subscribed
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff me featured if you like work
at a university or something it's like
I'll know that's what happened if like
you know 2,000 Xeon Phi's show up on
like our Amazon report or whatever
anyway the point is also in the
description is our merch store as well
as our community forum which you
shouldn't totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
