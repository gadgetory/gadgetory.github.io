Like, oh my god look at all this, they're homing, they're homing. You have to shoot them down.
You know when you're gaming at 4K resolution
It's easy to forget that under the hood of Microsoft's most powerful Xbox 1
Is little more than a low power AMD Jaguar processor
And an aging Polaris - based integrated graphics card
Oh and did I mention the mechanical hard drive.
See the truth is
if the Xbox 1 X ran standard windows with standard windows games
It would be dawg slow
But the other thing that's easy to forget is that
all of those parts in it
are fundamentally standard PC components
So what would prevent someone from building a faster game console?
oooh
Apparently nothing.
This
is the subor Z plus
A game console from China that we got our hands on
Lets uhh... lets take this baby for a spin, shall we?
Right after I tell you guys about GlassWire
Glaswire allows you to instantly see your current and past network activity, detect malware and block badly-behaving apps on your PC or android device.
Use offer code : 'Linus' and get 25 percent off GlassWire at the link below.
*Rad intro music*
Ignoring that then we've got two usb 2.0 type A ports on the front
and then 4 usb 3.0 ports around the back along with ethernet
twin hdmi ports though both of these are outputs
So there's no fancy cable blocks pass-through or anything like that
And three and a half millimeter jacks with audio
Along with a S/PDIF connector
On the bottom, there's this little latch right here and this is cool
It reveals two two and a half inch drive bays
Uhh should we fire it up and see what it looks like in action?
So this is a pretty bog-standard windows install
The only thing that really stands out about it out of the box is that
Everything that you see in the installed programs is stuff that we put on it, Its extremely clean.
The only preinstalled application is this uhhhh
What's it what's this thing called again
