disruptive we thought this is the phone
for the people we thought that's going
to explode on to the scene and force the
industry giants to lower their prices
and abandon consumer unfriendly
practices like freeloading bloated
Android skins and carrier locking their
devices but three years later nothing
has actually really blown up and it
appears to be one plus who is slowly
caving to the business realities of
competing in the smartphone market the
one plus five is still cheaper than
competing flag ships but the decision to
buy one is getting less and less obvious
let's take a closer look at it
CyberPower pcs lineup of gaming desktops
feature until seventh generation core i7
processors check them out at the link in
the video description let's get this out
of the way first I am NOT a huge fan of
the slipperiness of the new curved shape
and fine blasted aluminum finish on the
1 plus 5 but that's nothing a D brand
skin can't fix and their material
choices including two and a half d
Gorilla Glass 5 for the 5 and a half
inch 1080p AMOLED display and ceramic
for the lightning-quick fingerprint
sensor are difficult to question
internal highlights include a 10
nanometer Snapdragon 835 processor 64 or
128 gigs of non-expandable dual lane ufs
2.1 storage 6 or 8 gigs of shiny new
lpddr4 x ram lightning-fast wave 2 AC
Wi-Fi and dual sim support with very
broad mobile network compatibility
thanks to the process note shrink on the
CPU and GPU the lower power consumption
of this cutting-edge memory and some
software tweaks performance is better
than ever across the board and the 5
comfortably lasts me through the day
without delaying notifications from any
of my key apps and software overall
continues to be a strong point in
general for one plus oxygen OS is
lightweight responsive and almost as
clean as bone stock Android and where
they add things it makes sense
navigation buttons can be repositioned
and remapped at will and even moved on
screen if you prefer my mobile carriers
preference that mobile hotspot not be
possible to add to the quick settings
was rightfully ignored and swiping to
the right reveals whether a notepad
recent contacts and recent apps instead
of some bloated digital assistant but
the big highlight for me this time
around is
really the upgrade to gestures flip to
mute is for idiots unless you've got a
screen protector though thankfully
oneplus seems to be aware of this and
included one but three finger
screenshots with a single button to
press to auto scroll the rest of the
page I'm not sure how I lived without
that and the ability to map some canned
functions and any application launch I
want to five different drawing gestures
I have never launched Angry Birds on the
can so fast in my life
the double-click camera launch - is
among the fastest I've ever seen and on
that subject rightfully oneplus is
really proud of their first ever dual
camera solution in general dual cameras
can be used to capture sharper images or
more data like if they had separate
sensors for black and white and color
but oneplus is going after a shallow
depth of field effect for portraits and
this one made more of a difference to me
a built-in 2 X optical zoom overall I
would never know that this was a first
attempt at anything the 16 megapixel
selfie camera is pretty good but has a
very similar field of view compared to
the iPhone so I do wish it was a little
wider for group shots but I really loved
using the 5s rear cameras and unlike
some other devices I've reviewed in the
past I didn't feel for a moment like
switching to it during my review period
was causing me to miss out on properly
capturing precious moments with my
family the only reason that I personally
even care about having a high quality
cell phone camera and all the manual
dials and switches including raw capture
are therefore the photography nerds in
the native app - video recording is a
bit more of a mixed bag for me the
capture modes are limited compared to
other flagships so no 240 FPS slo-mo
there's no optical image stabilization
so 4k video isn't stabilized and 1080p
video has this weird
FPS character affected some people seem
to really like but I don't and there's
no obvious way to disable it and from a
usability standpoint I hate being forced
to switch to video mode when I open the
app before pressing the record button
rather than just having both buttons
ready for me on screen okay Celina sit
sounds pretty good but there's no
modular upgrades taller aspect ratio
screen retina scanner waterproof housing
stereo speakers pressure-sensitive
display or any other new standout
feature
why is this thing more expensive again
well as I alluded to before
oneplus has grown as a company solving
some of their initial problems like
their reliance on third-party software
and their limited product availability
though their customer service could
probably still use some work and they've
incurred the costs that go along with
this development so instead of coming in
at less than half the price of a
competing flagship they're now closer to
70% compared to the latest iPhone what
that means is that the oneplus 5 might
not be the clear and obvious flagship
killer choice for budget consumers but
we're also giving up less than ever
before which makes it a great choice for
a broader range of Android smartphone
buyers
how does deep brand do it every time
there's a hot new device D brands got a
hot new skin like Aldi brand skins it
features high quality authentic true
textured 3m vinyl and is cut with the
utmost of precision if you think it
looks great and you want one just like
it for your laptop phone tablet console
controller or more check out the link in
the video description and if you don't
think it looks great check out the link
anyway because their configurator allows
you to skin your device exactly the way
you want it so thanks for watching guys
