ever thought to yourself Linus is washed
up he's out of ideas or even I could do
it a hundred times better well today is
your chance to do just that we're
looking for two to three highly
motivated individuals to join our
writing staff and with their fresh ideas
and skills help us take Linus tech tips
from just barely tolerable to a handful
of people to the next level with
improvements to both the breadth and
depth of our content though of course we
wouldn't be able to afford any of that
if it wasn't for this obnoxious ad so
BRB
well Linus you're absolutely right
even our sales team is out of ideas so
if you want to support us you can buy
one of these shirts of the link in the
video description and it'll feed my
family and my wife and our cats so
please do that that'd be great
I'm gonna get right down to bidness
we're looking for individuals who are
able to help in the pre-production
process which involves researching and
requesting up-and-coming technology for
review brainstorming ways to tackle
existing technology from new or
interesting angles benchmarking testing
and validation of the above product or
ideas either by following our existing
protocols or building completely new
ones analyzing the results and forming
opinions documenting the entire process
and in terms that a lay person can
understand coordinating with our hosts
to ensure scripts can be written from
the notes or even writing the scripts
fully coordinating with our shooters and
editors to ensure the visual portion is
accurate and there are actually some
other thing we don't ask for much do we
there are some other things that we'll
be looking for as well aside from the
obvious great attitude good problem
solver works well independently or with
a team etc etc strong writers will have
the best chance if you're already
working for a tech publication you would
do well to include your portfolio we
will treat it with the utmost discretion
maker skills including experience with
programming CNC cutting 3d modeling and
robotics are a huge plus as always don't
bother applying if you don't have a
sense of humor you're gonna be working
with this guy for crying out loud and
this one isn't much better okay so
you're intrigued at this point and
wondering how to apply for this position
well we used to list all the things that
would disqualify someone from applying
like for example not having a Canadian
work permit and provide an email address
below the video for resume submissions
but this has proven to be too
complicated for some people in the past
so this time around there's a Google
Form linked under the video that we
would like everyone to fill out before
going any further once you answer all of
the skill testing quest
successfully you will receive further
instructions but the gist of it is this
you'll send a resume and cover letter
along with a portfolio if available and
additionally will provide some sample
scripts from our previous projects and
some suggested topics you'll pick a
topic to research and write about to
show off your skills note that you don't
have to use one of our sample topics and
a great way to stand out would be to
tackle something we've never done or
thought of before and you send them in
and hope for the best
now hold on a minute Linus we like yours
and Luke's approach to tech and Taryn
and Brandon are okay - what makes you
think we would like someone else's video
because this is already happening with
most of you probably not even noticing
some of the most fun videos that I've
hosted lately office makeover water
cooled ps4 ultimate DIY desk PC USB
typewriter and our DIY bomb cooler I
wrote or at least heavily edited the
scripts but they mostly weren't done by
me some of them weren't even my ideas
which doesn't mean that I am or anyone
here for that matter actually out of
ideas it just means that for us to keep
pushing the envelope and to do some of
the really cool stuff we have planned we
need more resources to dedicate to them
so be excited because whether you're one
of the successful candidates or you just
bought a rockin hashtag out of ideas
shirt you'll be part of a 20-17 that's
gonna be bigger and better than ever for
Linus tech tips thanks for watching guys
that this video sucks then like I don't
know what do you what do you want from
me we're it's a recruitment video what
am I supposed to do yeah by not gonna do
the look true</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
