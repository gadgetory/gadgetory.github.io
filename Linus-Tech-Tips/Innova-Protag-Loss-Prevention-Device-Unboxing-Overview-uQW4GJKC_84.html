card and USB reader for your mobile
devices check the link in the video
description to learn more about the a
data - drive air AE 400 now the irony of
a product that is designed to prevent
theft of your devices is that it comes
in the most like that proof packaging I
think I've ever seen you can't even open
the thing and now I've gone the user's
manuals ok though because we have
another one this is the Innova pro tag
so the idea of this is that it's a card
sized device so you can see it's quite
slim designed to fit in your wallet or
your purse or your passport holder or
whatever else that helps protect your
belongings and makes it harder for you
to lose your smartphone which I
personally think is a good thing alright
it uses bluetooth it's compatible with
Android and BlackBerry smartphones it
can sync to your mobile site ok why
don't we just do what it actually does
ok so the phone alarm rings when you
exceed the predetermined distance from
your belongings which is preset to 10
meters but can be adjusted and it allows
you to secure your mobile phone - you
can track down your stolen phone via SMS
if the SIM card is replaced new number
of details will be sent to you that's
very cool as well
so it has a hundred and fifty hour long
battery life and is chargeable via a
built-in USB cable so let's go ahead and
have a look at the actual device itself
so there's three different buttons or
things on here one looks like an LED
indicator the next thing says power
slash discovery and the last one says
distance it looks like that's how you
configure the distance over here appears
to be the built-in USB connector so you
can slide that out with a simple little
thumb slider right here
slide that in and out and you can charge
it for that 150 hour battery so let's go
ahead and fire this up there's an app
that you install on your phone obviously
so let's hold that down a little bit
know it's flashing blue and red so we're
going to figure out how to use this and
then we're gonna do a quick test here so
there's basically three main menu things
here so number one is the settings so
you can set it up to send an SMS to your
safe number when the sim change is
detected and then you can also do mobile
tracking with SMSing Pro tags based
password to your phone's to your mobile
number to track your phone's location so
there
default password which you can change
you can also change your alarm settings
whether you want it to ring on silent
and what volume you want it to use when
the phone itself is on silent next up
you've got adding protag devices so all
you need to do to do this is hold power
slash discovery until it flashes blue
and red so hopefully that'll happen
pretty quickly here there we go so blue
and red flashing then you click Add
device and it works like pretty much any
other Bluetooth thing where it takes a
second and then fires up so it takes
about 10 seconds and once that's done it
gives you a little pop-up showing you
how it pretty much works so you can
snooze the alarm if you go too far away
from the device so you can send a mount
of time don't bother me about this for a
little bit you can stop monitoring until
you start it again manually or you can
immediately continue to monitor and say
if you move closer to it and you're
ready to go okay so we've got Pro tags 1
&amp;amp; 2 so I'm gonna go ahead and call this
one I'm gonna change the little setting
here wallet okay
it helps if you spell wallet right there
you go so I'm gonna take this one and
put it in my wallet so just for
comparison this is three millimeters
which isn't quite the thickness of a
card but it's the same shape as a card
which makes it sort of something that at
least can fit in a wallet and I well
it's not that big but it fits in there
just fine
so the let's go through the rest of the
settings for our wallet device so
there's a last disconnected date and
time last known location which you can
check as well as a proximity ler so the
device is already within range and
connected delete this device and that is
pretty much it so let's go ahead and
let's go ahead and see how it works so
I'm gonna try and leave my wallet on the
unboxing table and I'll take this one
with me because so it's time for our
practical test now while this isn't the
sort of thing I'd see myself using
everyday it's the kind of thing that
maybe while I'm traveling would be
incredibly useful so you throw one of
them in say for example your luggage you
throw one of them in your wallet and
hope you don't lose your phone so unlike
the Kensington pr√≥ximo an alarm doesn't
go off because that one uses little fobs
that you can put on your keys for
example and that one has an alarm that
goes off on the fob
tells you if you left your phone behind
which is kind of neat as well but only
works on iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 whereas
this one is Android so there's different
sort of advantages and disadvantages
you've got away but I just want to show
you guys basically how long it'll take
for me to go okay wallets secured so I'm
gonna put that in the pocket where I
also have my luggage Pro tag then I've
got my wallet Pro tag which I put in my
wallet I'm gonna accidentally drop my
wallet my motorbike there's be rolls car
and oh there it goes so I can snooze the
alarm stop monitoring or reconnect so
you lost your belonging
wallet let's go ahead and go back there
I'm gonna try and reconnect and see if
it can see if they can pick that back up
for me there we go wallet is now secured
and on now that I have been reunited
with it thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the pro tag
