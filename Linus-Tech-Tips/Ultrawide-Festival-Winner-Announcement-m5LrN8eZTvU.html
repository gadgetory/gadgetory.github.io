on the ultra-wide Festival 2015 video
contest that we announced back in
September we got a ton of amazing
entries in no particular order here are
excerpts from a few that I absolutely
loved the system into the door and the
missile nuclear weapon attack
I make visual effects for short films I
am the fan of Linus tech tips I helped a
friend build his computer I learned how
to build computers from Linus tech tips
this is the rumor I was born on when it
came beautiful polygons well I made the
whole deal
Wow
so after picking 10 participants from
the first round to win an ultra-wide
34-inch Cerf monitor from LG a second
round of entries even better than the
last was created by the winners of the
first round and after much deliberation
I chose Ryland J to work with me on
building his ultimate $10,000 set up
around the monitor that he won in the
previous round and let me tell you
friends it is going to be a beauty we're
talking a 12 core processor 64 gigs of
ram dual dt x 980 TI s and sli new
camera new peripherals another ultrawide
monitor to match the first one wireless
earphones a new msi gs70 stealth laptop
I mean this thing is going to be sick
and this is cool the tower itself is
going to be built by none other than
yours truly I convinced Ryland to ship
the parts to me and let me share the
build with you guys while I do it so
stay tuned perhaps I'll even do a live
streamed build I've never done one of
those before in spite of you guys
requesting them several times so let me
know in the comments if you're into that
and thanks again so much to everyone who
participated in ultra-wide Festival 2015
and LG for hosting it I hope to see you
all again next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
