today well that won't be it no we still
have this thing this is the 64 core
computer and after all the testing we
did on it we never actually gamed on it
can you run games on a 64 core CPU that
was built for science we're gonna find
out for science
thanks to world of warships for
sponsoring this video world of warships
is the free online strategy warship game
from wargaming stay tuned for more and
an exclusive offer later on in this
video so if you think about it one
eternity later maybe this idea isn't
that crazy
you know gaming on a 64 core CPU because
believe it or not the CPU that's in here
is actually fundamentally the same thing
as that Intel graphics card prototype
that we did like an unboxing and history
lesson of a little while ago except that
instead of being on a PCI Express card
they've got like a whole motherboard and
it's like CPU socket and like exterior
memory slots kind of thing going on for
it so first things first we've got to
get this puppy somewhat reassembled
there's a hard drive in here for some
reason we've also got to put some more
RAM in we need to make sure we are
running it at its optimal 6 channels of
memory we need to chuck a boot SSD in
here so if I pull out all of these
ancient technology hard drive cages you
can kind of see where we jammed that in
and then last but not least we are going
to need a graphics card because
unfortunately the software development
that would have made Larrabee a
general-purpose processor that could run
DirectX code was never completed so
we're gonna start with a gtx 1060 i like
a high mid-range card just to see if
this is feasible at all before we move
on to something a little bit beefier and
investigate how much if any
bottlenecking occurs because what you
guys got to understand about gaming on a
you know heavily threaded multi-core
chip is that most games at best our
running with like for processing threads
and even in those cases it's primarily
single or maybe
we'll threaded with the other course
doing like little supplementary work you
know I had actually been meaning to do
this video as a precursor to the like
proper review like as like a teaser like
goofing around with it first and then
doing the proper video so yeah best laid
plans of mice and men and no comments on
which one I am
alright so trick number one is that we
have to run Windows Server rather than
regular Windows 10 and the reason for
that is that otherwise all 256 of our
logical cores will not get recognized
like I can't even
it just it actually can't even they're
just all percent signs brilliant like
beyond dumb but anyway that's not a
problem because as we demonstrated in
this video there's no difference in
performance between the different
editions of Windows they're all based on
the same kernel so it just comes down to
the feature set so all our hardware is
detected we've got the same GeForce
drivers that we put on the desktop and
it is time to fire up let's go let's
start with let's start with csgo is it
just me or is this steam update taking a
little long
so you didn't install chrome on this
thing Vegas this thing is taking forever
and like the stupid thing is that it
shows only one point nine percent CPU
usage but like but but think about that
of 256 threads each 1% would be only two
of them which would be half of one CPU
core am I getting this right ish so so
does that just mean it's single threaded
and it's relying on one of our 64 cord
because you got to understand not all
cores are created equally and these ones
are not high performance chrome yellow I
mean I clicked play a little while ago
but maybe it didn't take oh maybe it
legitimately didn't take okay there we
go this isn't so bad oh okay
there we go and remember friends this is
launching on an SSD imagine it with a
hard drive hey all right
pwned some noobs oh wow ok no no there
we go hey there we go alright so we're
not gonna ask too much from this thing
we're just gonna run it at 1080 I mean
the good news is that running that local
game server could be offloaded to
another core yeah
how long does it take to connect to a
server that is running on the same box
oh wow oh wow there bud oh boy no way
Bob Paul you shocked Oh bot chris is a
little better ok ok let's get let's get
let's get our 8k game on here oh I see
daddy's get out of the way Sean oh look
at the way those smoke effects just
destroy me oh my god - I am better like
this than I am with a proper computer or
them down oh dang I think you're messing
with me right now
in its defense this is the lowest end
Zeon 5 from this generation but it is
still an $1,800 process let's try Deus
Ex mankind divided I click for that
already by the way
ouch Anthony I'm not gonna bother
putting the tightened be in this thing
yeah really
this is ridiculous yeah well I'm sorry
man but this isn't even running in real
time anymore like this benchmark this
run is actually gonna take longer like
the physics of the gamer broken Wow oh
no I think this may be one of the most
exceptional bottlenecks that I have ever
seen which kind of think of it would
actually be a very interesting video we
should give that some thought
remarkably we're managing to get screen
tearing that's pretty cool
well I think those numbers basically say
everything there is to say minimum of
0.5 frames per second ouch all right let
it never be said that I'm not a sucker
for
punishment
one more game let's play fortnight on
this sucker like do you think I could
just take a nap on this table oh oh let
me know when the loading bar reaches the
top of my head you know they say I
watched pot never boils
I've got a new expression for them this
computer never loads anything I don't
know if it's gonna catch on oh no oh no
no no no oh no okay wait no I have no
time to talk about your new update stuff
what No remind me later what was that
boom let's do it yeah yeah okay play
people like me are the reason that you
need that loading area for a minute
before the match starts oh yeah look at
this the bus launched ten seconds after
I got into the game if I was any slower
I would miss the bus wow it's really
interesting seeing an online game try to
struggle with how slow this system is
because when you're playing online you
don't have the option of just slowing
down the physics of the game so I would
be curious to know if I am teleporting
all over the friggin place forever yes
okay so the point of these processors
obviously isn't gaming and they're
expensive because what they're useful
for is scientific work clothes like
tensorflow or neural networking for
example and actually in most cases these
processors do end up getting installed
in PCI Express cards like our Larrabee
prototype except without any display
outputs because they're not intended to
be used for any kind of graphics
application especially not like gaming
directly off it
as a card but this was definitely a fun
experiment in showing just how bad your
experience can be with expensive
hardware if it's not the right kind and
it's not optimized for the workload that
you are trying to perform now to be
clear not every Xeon is bad for gaming
this is a common misconception Alyssa
said oh and it's bad for gaming it comes
down to the architecture of the chip
this is a Xeon Phi this is fundamentally
different from a normal Xeon which is
usually pretty similar to a core i7 or
core I 9 just with fancy ECC memory
supporting world of warships is a
free-to-play historical online combat

every match plays a little bit
differently and every week there's
something new to experience with a
steady cadence of new missions game
