workshop and this is one that I've seen
a lot of times the post usually starts a
little something like this
so it's summer and in this tiny room on
my gaming computer and it is so frickin
hot when I'm playing games I think it
must be because my GPU is running at
like 80 degrees my CPU is at like 6070
degrees they got all these fans are
kicking out all this heat and I'm with
you so far so my plan is I'm going to
water cool the system to lower the
temperatures and make it so that my room
is a little cooler and more bearable
well hold on a minute I may not be a
fizzy Cola gist but I remember a little
something from my grade 10 science class
we did a unit on like that law of
conservation of energy that would
suggest that that approach may not work
to cool down the room but of course
we're going to investigate it today but
before you watch the rest of the video
vote in the straw poll below the video
let me know do you think water cooling
the CPU and GPU cooling them down will
make the room the PC is operating in
cooler or not
intel has brought ddr4 to the mainstream
with their core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more okay
so here's how we're going to conduct the
test inside the sanity closet here I've
got a sick gaming PC core i7 extreme
edition 128 gigs of ram gtx 980ti you
know the works this is a type K thermal
probe running into the room with my
thermometer that will be telling us the
ambient temperature inside the room so
right now we're just getting a baseline
reading to give us some idea of what
we're going to be working with
but next we're going to go in and
actually set up the machine to run
inside this room
okay so for our air-cooled scenario I'll
be using an octave NH d9l heatsink and
then I'll have a modest overclock just
one of the the one-button biosilver
clocks on the cpu and then for my video
card I'll be using a high-end gtx 980ti
in this case it's an amp edition from
ZOTAC I'll be running Unigine heaven on
loop and then I'll be coming back
periodically probably about every half
an hour to log the temperature the
ambient temperature inside the room
waiting for that rising temperature to
flatten out when it's reached
equilibrium with the climate-controlled
office that surrounds this tiny little
closet
okay so we've run into a bit of a
challenge in that I don't think we're
going to be able to just wait for it to
reach equilibrium because here we are
three and a quarter hours on the nose
later and we are all the way up to
twenty eight point two degrees without
any sign of that slowing down so what
we're going to have to do is check on
our results and then do a follow up
tomorrow where we take the same space at
the same starting temperature and then
see where it is that we end up after
three and a quarter hours let's call it
72 degrees will use that CPU temperature
as long as we use the same one then
we're in pretty good shape here and our
GPU diode is at a frosty 64 degrees so
that's with heav'n having been running
all this time the room is noticeably
warmer but of course we expected that so
all that's left to do now is swap out
these components so we're going to go
ahead and change that NH d9l out for an
H 100 I that's a dual 120 millimeter
liquid cooler so we should be able to
get those cpu temps down significantly
and we're changing out our ZOTAC
air-cooled card for one of these
slick-ass bad boys this is that MSI
Corsair collaborative hydro gtx 980ti
so with that out of the way we can wait
for the room to reach our starting
temperature again and then restart the
benchmarks
there we go friends we are officially
ready to rock so I'm going to go in
there and start it we're going to run
the test for 3 and 1/4 hours and see
where it is that we end up and I already
have a pretty good idea of where we're
going to end up but hey I could be wrong
so it's important to recreate the same
scenario again as before so we're going
to run those same benchmarks the system
stability test we're going to leave the
light on in the room I'm going to take
my laptop out of here and let's see how
she does
startsnow Wow I actually couldn't have
written this story better myself
27-point not 28.0 so after three hours
and 15 minutes on the nose the room
heated up the same amount in spite of
the fact that our GPU temperatures are a
frosty 53 degrees so let's pull that
baby up right there 53 degrees on the
GPU with the CPU sitting down at 40 50
degrees so both of them are cooler
running but the amount of heat that they
generate that needs to be dissipated
into the room is identical because the
thermal energy that's being output is
not actually necessarily related to the
temperature at which something is
running so there you have it guys if the
objective is to cool down the room then
the only sane way to achieve that would
be to water cool all the computers in
the room and put a radiator on the roof
of your building simple powerful
beautiful that's a really old slogan
