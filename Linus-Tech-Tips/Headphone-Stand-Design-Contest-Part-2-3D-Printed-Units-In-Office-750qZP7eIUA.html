a package that is to say a package in
the mail with a whole bunch of really
cool stuff in it what's that Linus
bubble wrap no this is my follow-up for
the Silverstone design a new headphone
stand for Linus competition so I have I
believe it is 13 3d printed headphone
stands designs from members of the Linus
tech tips community to try out today and
declare a winner that silverstone will
be using their manufacturing prowess to
turn into a finished product of this
quality so I am really looking forward
to this let's see how it goes
so you guys probably know cable mod
cables we've featured them in a lot of
our build guides and build logs well hey
now they have support for Coursera RMI
and our MX series power supplies check
out the link in the video description to
check that out ooh that one's cool so
while I'm finishing unwrapping these
I'll give you guys a little bit of the
history of the journey of how these 3d
printed headphone stands got to be here
we received literally hundreds of
submissions and I'm talking even if you
exclude the penis-shaped ones for this
design contest some of which were
excellent some of which were not as
excellent but the ones that you see here
before you are the cream of the crop so
my mini factory that's actually their
contribution to this whole thing 3d
printed every single design that was
submitted than it was sent back to us to
pick our favorite ones which were
printed in high quality at full scale to
be sent to me to evaluate and determine
which ones would be the which one would
be the winner because everyone whose
design is in front of me on the table
actually gets a copy of the winning
design but only the person who submitted
the winning design gets an anodized gold
color version of it along with the other
two colors of it so let's uh let's get
started here and figure out the pros and
cons of of each of these different
headphone stand designs all right so the
basic process that I'm going to be going
through is I will be finding all the
parts based on the original models
submitted on my mini Factory so you can
actually check this up something that's
cool is you guys can actually download
these and print them anytime you want
off of my mini factory comm if you're if
you're into that sort of thing so I'll
find the original models assemble all
the different pieces that go with them
and then I will be mounting them to this
board here and then using a pair of
headphones as a quick test to see kind
of how it is really functionally in the
real world so since I'm holding this one
why don't I start with this one from
wall-e hmm so pros and cons of Wally's
design the split construction means that
it's going to be relatively easy to
manufacture so you just build two pieces
and then join them with a screw in the
middle here making it also very compact
to package and ship the simple elegant
design I actually find quite appealing
and I think matches fairly well with the
design language that silverstone is
already using on their existing
headphone stand product the one thing
that I don't really like about this one
is something that's going to be common
with a lot of the other designs and
that's that there's no real thought
given to where to manage the cord
something that's less of an issue on a
desktop mounted stand where it can sit
on the table than it is on a
wall-mounted design where it simply will
fall down to the floor okay this is a
really nice design it looks like three
or four pieces to construct so there
will be some assembly required but what
I like about this one is the nice gentle
arch that holds the headphones the fact
that it has a lip to prevent them from
falling off if you know I don't know a
neighbor bangs on the wall on the other
side or whatever else you don't want
your headphones to come tumbling down
and it has an integrated knob for
keeping your cables out of the way even
the extraordinarily long cable on the HD
650 s here was able to be managed oh
this is kind of cool actually there's I
didn't even notice this before but there
is a little holder on the right-hand
side to actually route the cable cleanly
up to the knob as well so it doesn't
just kind of hang over the side like
that very nice so this design is from
Patrick Brower okay so this design from
Brian Pearson is a little bit different
from the rest of them for a couple of
reasons number one is points off for not
really giving any thought to the
mounting mechanism for it I had to just
use double-sided tape and I guess he
figured Silverstone would soar
that which is not entirely unfair but
definitely something that's nice to see
people consider but the other main
difference is that Brian's design seems
to mostly consider portable headphones
like smaller headphones like the kinds
that you're looking at here this is a
pair of sennheiser momentum 2.0 s now
there was some thought given to cable
management but I'm not really a huge fan
of the approach because it doesn't
really hold it very well and while I can
see that I think this is to hold the
connector right here it gives it a bit
of a messy look on the wall so I would
have liked to see a little bit more
consideration for that in this design
this next design from Matt selnick
definitely wins points for elegance I
actually really like the shield style
wallplate the support brace here while
not necessary when we're talking hanging
headphones off a piece of aluminum I
think looks really good and it'll be
appealing to folks who own both small
and larger headphones but the things
that I think are missing in this
designer that I'd like to see the
wallplate be a little bit bigger and I
would also like to see more thought
given to cable management yes a
recurring theme I know so this design is
from I'm gonna say yarn okay
I tried well either way there were a
couple things that I really liked about
it number one is it has like kind of a
Starship Enterprise esque look to it not
quite sure how that happened but
definitely the inner geek and me
appreciates that number two is clear
thought has been given not only to how
you can hang small lightweight
headphones looks great by the way but
also large heavier headphones because it
gets the holder far enough away from the
wall that it's not going to bump against
anything I also do like the fact that it
has an integrated cable management
system where you can wrap it around the
wall plate but there were a couple of
things that didn't appeal to me that
much as well I think the wall plate
could have been larger this would have
made cable man
meant a little bit easier and improve
the aesthetics and I think that the
support shaft really doesn't look that
great with larger headphones on it so
the design could have stood to be a
little bit beefier overall but this
one's are really really solid offering
so this design from Steven flavin
intrigued me more than anything else and
I really really had to see it in person
basically there's a couple of different
things going on here not all of which
are apparent when just looking at the 3d
model picture so number one is that with
a little popping thing here you can
actually fold it down in the event that
you don't feel like storing your
headphones on it and you can restore it
to its locked status here and number two
is that while it appeared as though this
bottom piece could be raised in the
model it doesn't actually seem to
account for that in the design so I was
kind of thinking it was a double layered
design but if you look at where it lines
up it would be it would interfere with
the top headphones anyway so while I
definitely like the sort of the folding
down concept here I think due to
manufacturing difficulties as much as
anything else this one's not going to be
coming away with the prize but
definitely like the idea this design
from Michael I actually I think I liked
it a little bit more in the renders it's
got kind of a cool contouring thing
going on very very artsy but in terms of
practicality
it doesn't have a very broad surface for
the top of the headphones to rest on so
it's actually going to dent the
headphone padding there a little bit not
much thought really given to cable
management but I do like I do like what
Michael was going for here in terms of
the look and how it'll look on the wall
when it doesn't have headphones on it in
fact I think I like this one better
without the headphones on it which is a
little bit unique
so our next design here is one that I
actually really like this one from
Matthew Vidal a lot of thought given to
mounting on this one so you go ahead and
you screw in the rear plate then the top
piece locks into place from the
top very simple design very elegant
looking headphones go on like so again
points off for no real thought given to
cable management but I love the
simplicity
I love the the lip at the edge so that
the headphones aren't going to slip off
by accident
love the spacing off the wall just right
to have the headphones like sitting
right in the middle and not banging up
against the wall really do really do
like this one from from Matthew here all
right so we got Matthews design here
which is a folding kind of this looked
better in the render but I'm sure
Silverstone would replace that with like
their logo or something but it's a
folding design that actually has the
benefit of being able to tuck the top
piece it doesn't go all the way in
because of the scaffolding of the 3d
printing but you can see here it would
basically go all the way inside when
you're not using it or all you do is
slide this piece through locks into
place and boom you put your headphones
on just a little something like that and
this is cool too you can use that space
in the top that you can store ah that
you can store the headphone holder in to
hold the cord whenever you're not using
it I actually quite like this one and
finally our last entry this one's called
model circular a and I really really
like this one I knew coming into this
this was going to be the one to beat
this is by henning Weber Weber Oh
either way basically the way this puppy
works is it's big and I can see that
being a turn-off for some people but it
brings with it a lot of functionality so
there's a slot right here to run your
cords through so you go ahead and just
kind of throw your cords into the into
the cable organizer pouch there then you
can put up to two pairs of headphones on
it personally I'm not a huge fan of the
way the second pair of headphones goes
on at the back but it's nice to at least
have the space for it since it is kind
of a bulkier design and then you go
ahead and you put your second pair of
headphones on the front what I like
about how large the little cubby here
for cables
is that you can also Jam some
accessories in there like two and a half
mil to three and a half millimeter jack
adapters for examples I'm going to go
ahead and pop this in here and we will
declare the winner well I think we might
as well I think we might as well declare
the winner now I'm really liking this
one so assuming that Silverstone can
find a way to manufacture it then I'm
going to go with the circular a design
right here and then I think I'm actually
going to make my runner-up in the event
that this cannot be made this puppy
right here so thank you to everyone who
participated remember everyone whose
design was shown off here today does get
a finished copy of the winning design
and the winner not only gets black and
silver but also a gold anodized version
of their winning design and I think
that's pretty much it guys and on that
