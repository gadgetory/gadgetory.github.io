the hype you've probably read about that
whole router debacle with the faulty
shielding but that's fixed now and
there's no denying then that the 27-inch
LG 27 MD 5k
ultrafine 5k monitor is one of the
slickest on the market right now but
does the fact that it's being aimed
primarily at Apple zombies it even
launched exclusively through the Apple
Store mean that it's a no-go
for Windows geeks I mean it's just a
monitor right it should be okay right
well let's peel back the layers of this
sexy little onion and see if she makes
us cry
synergy is the software that lets you
share your mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers check it out now at
the link in the video description the
experience of unboxing the ultra fine 5k
though not quite on Apple's level was
definitely more pleasing than what we're
used to from LG immediately apparent
upon unboxing the product and removing
it from its super cool shiny spacesuit
are a couple of unusual characteristics
of the LG v k's industrial design it's
got a sophisticated matte finish it's
disappointingly plastic rather than
aluminum like the apple cinema displays
of your but it still looks and feels
pretty good
it lacks buttons entirely so that means
no on-screen display for making
adjustments to the inputs or image
quality though at least one of those
isn't important as we'll see later and
the thickest side of the bezel which
would normally be on the bottom we'd
call it the chin bar is actually at the
top so did we call this like a like a
brow brow bar but this is interesting it
looks like they were making room for the
ambient light sensor that should be
enabled through a future software update
at some point and the only disruption to
the 5ks otherwise totally clean facade
the very nice-looking 1080p camera and
front facing microphone the base stands
out from the crowd as well it's solidly
constructed with a pleasing high-quality
vibe and offers both a generous degree
of tilt and near giraffe like vertical
reach and if that's not enough there's
actually a vase amount included in the
box which I guess brings us pretty well
around to the back the 6 foot power cord
attaches seamlessly Apple style to the
rear panel and would you look at that
i/o a single port type rules the entire
our panel whether you like it or not
this is probably a window into the USB
type-c dominated future that we are
headed for so these three are USB 3.1
five gigabit data ports each capable of
pushing seven and a half watts of power
so enough to charge your phone or other
USB device and this one which is the
only input on this monitor that's right
just one looks the same as the other
ones but has far more going on under the
hood it's a Thunderbolt three input
which allows it to not only carry the
data for those USB ports and the 880 to
million pixels per second from your
machine to the display but also to push
85 watts of power the other way enough
to charge your laptop that's right kids
this one cord solution lets you leave
your charger in your backpack because
the included six and a half foot cable
is all it takes to transform your
supported laptop into a full-on
5k workstation and they absolutely
nailed this whole experience with the
2016 MacBook Pro side-by-side everything
about the image looks just right from
the color to the eye piercing 500 nits
brightness on Macs to the very similar
anti glare glossy appearance to the
retina like astonishing sharpness of the
218 pixel per inch panel but we promised
this was a Windows users perspective
didn't we so let's plug it into a razor
blade okay there we go and wow that
actually looks really shot wait a tick
there's no five in that number why the
heck is windows capping the resolution
somewhere between Ultra HD and the
native 5k
the display supports Windows 10 can go
up to 8 K so what gives relax
tech tips Linus tech quickie Linus is
that you it sure is
so you remember that one cord solution
that you were all excited about a second
ago uh-huh
well it turns out that driving a 5k
display over one cable is an
industry-first all other 5k and up
monitors use to DisplayPort cables
driving 5k over one is only achievable
right now using special Apple
shenanigans why well a Thunderbolt 3
cable can actually carry two DisplayPort
1.2 ports worth of data but the
Thunderbolt 3 port on your Windows
machine can't send enough to fill those
8 DisplayPort lanes because of how it's
hooked up internally the reason you can
do this on your 2016 MacBook Pro is
because Apple implemented a special
controller that funnels the resources of
2 DisplayPort ports into that single
Thunderbolt 3 that's why if you were to
try to plug in to ultra fine 5 KS in
your 2016 MacBook Pro which you can
totally do by the way you have to plug
them in to opposite sides of the machine
for both to work the more you know right
this episode was brought to you that
that I fresh book hey where are y'all
going from here ok then so in a nutshell
the ultra fine 5k is more like the ultra
fine for in a bit k when it's used with
anything but the 2016 MacBook Pro and
unfortunately it actually gets worse
than that because there's no on-screen
display you're relying on integration
with the OS to control the monitor which
is fan
tastic on the mac but your mileage may
vary on windows we were able to control
the volume of the surprisingly decent
internal speakers but we couldn't manage
to adjust the screen brightness up or
down and it's not just resolution
difference and lack of control that are
iffy because windows relies on
applications to do all color matching
rather than doing it pixel by pixel on
the OS level like the Mac PC users will
never get to experience the consistently
awesome color accuracy enabled by this
factory calibrated display to be clear
it's still a very good 8-bit IPS panel
with AFRC to simulate 10-bit color and
it's got 99% coverage of the DCI p3
color space so even on a Windows machine
it'll be suitable for photo editing and
graphics work but at $1,700 you'd be
paying a premium for oomph that you
aren't receiving and this is especially
true when you consider that both Dell
and HP have 27-inch 5k offerings with
somewhat similar specs at lower price
points so while 5k at this size is
awesome I mean really I can clearly make
out objects in the backgrounds of
thumbnail sized images and the LG ultra
fine 5k will be arguably the best
display experience on the market for the
MacBook Pro until Apple challenges it
with their own upcoming cinema display
refresh on Windows the experience could
be better described as fine than ultra
fine synergy is a software download that
solves the problem of having two
keyboards and two mice cluttering up
your desk it allows you to share one
Mouse and one keyboard between two or
even more computers so you'll no longer
get confused which keyboard or mouse
goes for which
they've got a basic and a pro option
with a one-time payment for lifetime
access and features include things like
clipboard sharing between the computers
dragging and dropping files between the
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and more and what's even more amazing is
it works cross-platform
Windows Mac and Linux so use our link in
the video description to get 50% off
synergy today so thanks for watching
