in the video description it was just as
hard I think as I was expecting I might
die here I was gonna have to turn back I
was quite certain within about the first
half hour of the hike that I was not
going to make it
I expected a expedition where we would
be camping out at the top or on middle
of mountain and that it would be take
maybe two or three days I was definitely
was not disappointed when I found out
that was not the case and when I found
out about this I was really excited I
thought it would be a great trip and
whether it was an overnight trip or not
I was pumped I loved outdoors I love
hiking so I was just really excited
overall I felt somewhat ready I've been
training for a backpack that I'm doing
in about three weeks
so I'm in somewhat better shape than I
was maybe six or nine months ago but
still with the elevation with everything
I was a bit concerned I'm really glad
that I made it but it was just as hard I
think as I was expecting I didn't
prepare nearly enough the one thing I'm
really glad I did is at the very last
possible second and my doctor really
gave me a lot of heck about this is I
went in and I got a prescription for
some drug whose name I can't pronounce
that is supposed to supposedly help with
altitudes sickness up to an altitude of
around 8,000 feet of course the town
we're staying at is at around what
11,000 feet and then the summit is over
14,000 feet so I did not nearly
adequately prepare for the altitude
change the one thing I was really happy
with was my hiking gear even if it had
rained I think I still would have been
ok but I was I was pretty well set up
for that the real part was bringing my
shoes to the cobbler I have these really
nice hiking boots and the front flap on
one of them is completely destroyed and
the rest of its kind of fine they fixed
the back which had no real issues and
then left the front flapping I was like
this is not what you do at a cobbler
took them back to the cobbler to be like
kay I need you guys to actually fix this
they said oh yeah we close at 9:00 on
Saturday you can come pick them up
I googled them too and it said they
closed at 9:00 I show up they close at
6:00 I showed it for about 6:10 did not
get my boots back and then I walked the
whole thing in basketball shoes that I
borrowed from a friend the ascent below
the tree line was where I really got
worried about my team overall I had
realized by about
thirty minutes in that neither of my
camera operators were going to be able
to capture the ascent with their cameras
because they were at the very very back
of the pack also below the tree line I
had begun to experience numbness up to
from about my fingertips to hear in my
hand and cyanosis and the fingertips
meaning that I was succumbing to
altitude sickness I gave myself 15
minutes to have it subside and I went
pretty slow
- hopefully acclimate a little bit more
before I figured I was going to have to
turn back I was quite certain within
about the first half hour of the hike
that I was not going to make it having
never hiked anything ever before not
even like the grouse grind in Vancouver
which is the easiest thing in the world
because it's just stairs I went out and
bought shoes and went out and bought
like Clif Bar way to make lip bars I get
to the hotel and I carry my normal
luggage mic my clothing luggage and my
backpack up up the stairs and I almost
blacked out up the stairs the altitude
just knocked me to the floor like I
could not move without my head pounding
like I I was lying in bed just gasping
for air so when thinking about the next
day I was like oh I'm gonna die I never
thought I would do anything like this I
mean I do like walks and hikes and stuff
and not like up 14,000 feet on a
mountain so yeah I know I mean
especially not taking like keyboards and
laptops and the whole deal now I never
thought in a million years I would do it
but you know what glad I did it was
awesome I've done some 13,000 foot
mountains before in the past so I knew
it was kind of what to expect not in
Colorado out in California and I knew it
was going to be one of the hardest
things I've ever done in my life
so just mentally I felt like I was
respecting them out so they sent below
the tree line was it was the beginning
of the day full of energy I only got
maybe three and a half four hours of
sleep so once I got into the woods this
is like my home ground I'm originally
from Alaska
so going right back into this kind of
space and climbing up through all these
woods and jumping through these trails
was reminding me back when I was like 10
my scent it's pretty miserable I was
pretty horrified the entire time up I
honestly didn't think I was going to
make it within the first 15 20 minutes
of the hike I was so out of breath and
I'm
like I'm only like 5% of the mountain
and at this rate I'm gonna die before I
actually make it to the top but there
came a certain point I think it was
probably after the tree line when I was
putting you know more than halfway there
where I was like well I've been pretty
much forced into making it to the top at
this point I'm not going to just come
all this way and then turn around and
head back down that would just be a
complete failure it was just out of the
option so I just I hated the fact that I
knew that I had to finish the hike but
it was cool I think they had a little
bit more brawn than brain and they just
decided to like we're gonna do this and
they did it multiple people made like
kind of like wrong decisions like I
think Luke PI should turned around
earlier but he was like a monster he's
like I don't give a I'm gonna make
it to the top nothing is stopping me and
you would ask me are you okay like nope
I'm still going above the treeline the
ascent got much easier for me I actually
didn't experience any altitude sickness
related symptoms once I got past the
trees and aside from I'd say the really
the really tough part was the extremely
vertical Rocky and not very grippy slope
where your feet could easily slip out
from under you that was about halfway
between the tree line and the actual
summit that was the most difficult part
for me where we were basically taking 20
maybe 30 40 steps and then we were
sitting down and taking like a bite a
Clif Bar and then a drink from the
Camelback before we could keep going
being on the summit and actually
achieving this I mean we thought about
this over a year and a half ago and I
always say this is an excuse to work
while having fun at the same time
because I love doing this kind of stuff
actually being up there and doing it it
was I don't know kind of a weird feeling
it was I had this weird I didn't I
almost felt nothing and everything at
the same time you look around and it's
like this amazing view and then you're
like playing doom which is the game that
got me started on land gaming and the
game that got just about everyone else
started on land gaming and the game that
got land gaming started pretty much in
the first place standing at the top of
the 14,000 400 foot Mountain is one
thing standing at the top of a 14,000
400-foot mountain with a bunch of guys
with laptops and keyboards playing doom
on a land with the batteries that we
hauled up in the router that we hauled
up and we got like notebooks strewn
across rocks and we got keyboards in our
lap
some were all yelling because Kane is
killing everyone and so there's victory
cries from like that one spot and then
moaning from pretty much everywhere else
it was unlike anything that I've ever
ever experienced before in my life it
was absolutely stunning and beautiful
and yet I was looking at a screen but
not the whole time so I got to have both
of those outstanding experiences at the
same time you know it's funny that you
asked that because the most memorable
thing for me was actually not
necessarily the summit itself or the
view from the summit it was when I began
to realize how high up we were when I
was looking down on lakes and they were
getting smaller and smaller so it maybe
wasn't one image but it was hiking for
10 or 15 minutes and realizing how much
higher I was then I was even 10 minutes
ago and just marveling at what we were
achieving and the people around me that
were doing it to because I had people in
front of me that I was watching make the
climb and I had people behind me that I
was looking back at watching them come
over the same terrain that I was and
having that experience of progress was
probably the most memorable thing about
the trip for me
Oh hosting the Highlander flag was I was
unreal I mean what we went through to
get that flag made at the last minute
and then standing there having had so
much of our team actually make it to the
top I mean I straight-up didn't think I
was going to make it I was sure Brendan
wasn't going to make it and just being
able to all be there holding the flag
having it waving flapping in the wind
was truly once-in-a-lifetime experience
I'm so proud of Brandon when he came
over the top of the hill I was floored
because we crossed a small creek at the
very bottom and his foot fell in and he
barely made it across the logs and I was
like dude for like 15 minutes into this
you're not going to make it man and as
we were had all finished packing up and
we were at the end of the journey and we
were going home he comes up over the
edge and I'm like dude come here there's
no time for you to sign the book the
snow is coming down but I got the camera
you got to touch the flag that's at the
top I'm going to video it it happened so
I was I'm so proud of him it I was just
exhausted I was out of
I kept looking up at everyone else I was
in front of me and I wasn't I was like
I'm not gonna be able to keep up with
him how am I gonna how am I gonna do my
job because like as a camera operator I
have to capture what's going on and I
just I was working really hard and I
really really did not have any
confidence that I was gonna make it you
just have to keep believing and making
sure that you find a rhythm and
everything that don't get in the zone
where everything that you think is
pulling you down just make it leave your
head and and just keep on pushing
knowing I was so close to making it and
then just making the decision to turn
back I I don't think I regret it
couldn't catch my breath like even just
sitting there I was gasping freezing I
just had to turn back and I think that
is the right choice
so Corsair gives us like you know k95
and k70 RGB keyboards and I thought we
were gonna get a mouse so I know the
guys of course you were like huh we're
gonna carry this to the top I knew they
were laughing at us I just knew that
they were laughing knowing that we're
gonna carry these things to the top now
I cannot stand gaming on a laptop
because I just don't deal with the key
so I was I put it right on top of the
keyboard and I was really really happy
and I made sure that I grabbed the brown
switches because I like the brown
switches a lot so I like dug through the
pile another made sure I got that one
there was only like one or two of them
and I grabbed it so I was really happy
about that
and in the gaming laptop was completely
overkill because we're playing doom
right so we've got the Asus laptop it's
got the the brand-new 4710 in it so
we're just taxing the hell out of that
4710 with doom but it was a really sleek
laptop I do like the aesthetic of it the
descent was terrible I was fine all the
way up and then we started coming down
and I couldn't really breathe properly I
started getting seriously dizzy I had a
migraine and I think due to the migraine
I couldn't really see very well it got
to a point actually at one point where I
couldn't see pretty much at all I threw
up about six times which is the big
problem dehydration and stuff like that
and
it was it was bad once I got to the
treeline though I laid down for about
five minutes I'm in the trees the air is
a lot better there's a lot better in the
trees and it is even in town and sprang
back up and I was completely okay
everything was gone no vision problems
no more vomiting everything's fine
we start going down and then we realized
Jimmy's not really keeping up with the
pack and he's got a whole bunch of
problems with his knees and he's feeling
sick and all that kind of stuff so it's
on the way down I got past the steepest
part and right after the steepest part I
literally felt like I had no energy in
my body whatsoever and my knees were
starting to like hurt really bad because
I just had no energy and Austin and I
run back and shoulder carry him we start
rotating bags around I'm carrying Jimmy
Logan's helping and we eventually kind
of make it down right the point where
were rationing water because we have
basically none left we're eating tons of
different food we have no communication
with the Basecamp at this point in time
we know it's coming down at one point
Linus was anchoring me and then because
I couldn't see and he takes off he's
like I'm gonna go get some footage up
ahead I'm like okay and I kind of stay
there and then I see him sprinting down
the hill and I'm like oh so guess he's
not coming back thanks bro and then
we're trying to get down the last part
through the trees or messaging cane and
Ramez trying to message people and we
get a message back that's like some
quote from some frickin movie that I
don't even remember like thanks bro so
we're trying to get down this mountain
we have no water left people are
seriously dehydrated like having actual
issues we're carrying people like
ridiculous I get down to the bottom like
we all get down to the bottom there's a
lightning storm partway through we all
get down to the bottom I'm ready to
murder Linus I'm ready to murder Kane
I'm going to murder multiple people but
I'm just like I'm just gonna shut up and
wait and see what the stories are
everyone had good stories so it was okay
I didn't have to kill anyone
and then yeah that was that was the
design all by myself in the snowstorm
wearing a shirt and windbreaker I had
like this much of Gatorade left this
much of a Clif Bar left and I was
thinking I could actually die up here
I had bumped into a couple who were
making their way down there like hey do
you need some water or food I'm like
yes please okay so we kind of came
around this Bend and you come around
this Bend and then there's these last
set of switchbacks and you can see the
the parking lot down below but they're
still like another good quarter half
mile to get down these switchbacks right
as we come around there's some rain
starts falling and we start to hear a
couple lightning a couple Thunderbolts I
started counting as soon as I would see
a flash the first one is only maybe five
or six seconds still too close to
comfort but we just as soon as we
started hearing the first one or two we
started moving much much faster coming
around this one switchback is the most
vivid experience that I had I was
looking straight down I could see
Brandon and I was still in front of me
at that point Brandon and Luke were in
front of me and at the end of the
switchback where it turns back
just beyond lightening bolt just
straight down and no no delay at all
between when the lightning bolt went and
the Thunder so it's just like it's on
top of you at any moment you're thinking
if lightning hits a tree next to me
it could arc over to me and you could
just die or or maybe just get really
badly injured I guess but so at that
point we were fearing for our lives and
the adrenaline took us the rest of the
way down the mountain it was a harrowing
frightening and kind of terrible
experience but honestly very memorable
and in retrospect since nobody died I
guess good to some to some degree
let it be known to the world that Linus
is a litter bug you should be fun to
yourself we're in a beautiful place
there's food in here
shame you throw around threw it on the
ground you want to rest of the cake too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
