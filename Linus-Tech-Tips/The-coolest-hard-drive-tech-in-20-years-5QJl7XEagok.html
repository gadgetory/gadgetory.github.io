by D brand the D brand grip case and
their prism screen protector are a great
way to keep your phone safe check them
out at the link in the video description
so we're here in Seagate and we don't
actually cover hard drives every time
because let's face it they're really
really boring every year it's like oK
we've got some more capacity and like it
might go a bit faster who also we've got
green on our stickers now but this is
different
so Seagate's been working on a
technology called heat assisted magnetic
recording or hammer since 1999 and the
first time they built a drive using this
technology it lasted for a grand total
of one that sector worth of rights and
then it was destroyed so to call it up
concept at that stage is probably being
generous with that said they've been
hard at work on it for the last 20 years
and they are finally at the point where
they are ready to announce that hammer
drives will be shipping to customers
this year so how does it work then you
can actually see a live feed of a hammer
head totally intentional I'm sure so
that's the drive head and it's hammer
technology writing data to the platter
that is running live next to me right
here and every time it moves around
you're gonna see a flash that's the head
heating up the platter to approximately
450 degrees Celsius completely wiping
out any data that was already there and
rewriting it this allows them to get
better areal density to the point where
we should see if they stay on target 20
terabyte drives by the year 2020 so this
drive right here combines their hammer
technology with their shield helium
drive technology which gives us the
power consumption savings that you'd
expect from a modern drive as well
now reliability remember that story at
the beginning how long are these things
going to last so they have had tests
running in their lab for the last 18
months where they have individual heads
that have seen over 8,000 hours of just
constant rates going through them to put
that in perspective that's up
petabyte and a half of data that's been
written through a single head about
equivalent to the entire Netflix library
that is if the internet is to be
believed so who's it going to be
reliable well I mean I think that guy's
job depends on it so let's go with yeah
for his sake but hammer doesn't solve
all of the hard drive industry's
problems something that I've noticed in
Seagate has had other customers point
out to them is that as these drive
capacities get higher and higher and
higher
without a performance improvement to
match we're getting to the point where
it's kind of like what happened with SD
cards before they've got past you know
20 to 30 megabytes a second of write
speeds where you'd like get a new SD
card or a thumb drive and you'd be like
yeah so this is you know a terabyte or
whatever but it would take me literally
weeks to fill it with data like it's
it's not really useful anymore so to
address that there's Mach 2 and oh sorry
this is actually running oh it's like
warm and what Mach 2 is it's really cool
so they've got a glass top on this drive
so we can see exactly what's happening
but in effect in a multi platter drive
so most of the top ones here are glass
so you can see the two actuator arms
moving independently of each other so it
uses a single SAS interface which takes
advantage of Sasa's ability to have two
sort of virtual ports available for a
single cable connected to a single
connector so the drives firmware and
processor take the incoming stream of
data and split it between the two
separate heads this effectively doubles
the eye ops performance of this drive
compared to a normal drive which would
run off of a single actuator arm which
brings us finally to the most
controversial item here in the Seagate
booth I've had everything from eye rolls
to speaking directly to the person whose
pet project this is but this is the you
know what I forget the name so I'm going
to call it the hard drive zamboni and
what it effectively is is a like
fiberglass shell with like these tread
style you know
remover type you know treads on the
front that contains a for you server
rack so the idea is that Amazon has a
product called
what if they got they got snowball which
is a little one they've got snowmobile
which I think like a semi-trailer where
the idea is they've got these high-speed
interfaces where you pull these things
up to your data center offload
everything and like literally drive it
somewhere because it's faster than
trying to send it over the internet so
this is supposed to be like kind of like
the middle stage where you like load a
bunch of data onto it and then you like
drive it over somewhere and it could be
like battery power - then you could
offload it and that might be faster than
using a network so imma let you guys
decide the controversy for me is this
something the world needs more of or
something the world needs less of let me
know in the comments below
speaking of things - let me know in the
comments below let me know how much you
love these sponsor spots that we've been
doing for dbrand all show B brands grip
is there a new case that's super grippy
it's got extra clickable buttons and
precision cutouts for your camera
fingerprint sensor and whatever else it
is that you need it's also fully
customizable with the D brand skin and
their prism screen protector is well
well basically the demo kind of says
everything you need to know about it
it's got a great applicator so you can
put it on perfectly every time and the
impact resistance of this thing is
unreal like I was using a phone to
hammer a nail into a piece of wood
peeling off the prism and the screen is
still pristine you got to see it to
believe it which is why we put footage
of it doing its thing in front of your
face right now so your eyeballs can
capture that so check them out at the
link in the video description so thanks
for watching guys don't miss any of our
CES 2019 content by making sure you're
subscribed to lines tech tips and we
will see you at the next absolutely
nothing we're done now this one might
get released like earlier because the
editors I don't know how they do the
things they do so there might actually
be more coming but I'm done
peace of now and I'm on a plane in like
four hours hell yeah I mean I love
seeing yes sorry that's what I meant to
say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
