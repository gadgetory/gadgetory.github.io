something that we haven't done before we
are revealing the identity of the
cameraman it's this guy now I'm kidding
actually we're getting a microphone for
NCIX tech tips we're getting a proper
microphone that isn't a little weird
like Twinkie thing that I clipped to my
clip to my shirt this is a proper lapel
mic from sennheiser it's the e w 1 12 p
and it is a clip-on microphone condenser
omnidirectional okay so ill okay yeah it
includes a receiver a body pack
transmitter as well as a clip-on mic it
runs off for double-a batteries and it
has output cables 2.5 millimeter jack
and XLR i actually don't know all the
details of this the cameraman helped me
pick something because he is kind of the
expert on all of this stuff but we have
the g the PG 3 so pd3 here so we have a
setup that looks like this so that's why
don't we just open it let's just open it
forget this it doesn't even come sealed
I was very surprised for a microphone
system that retails for nine hundred
dollars I had expected it to like I
don't know have shrink wrap on it or
something but okay here we go wow that
is a heck of an instruction manual I
hope this isn't a lot of languages yes
it is ok so the languages are available
are 9 and let's see how long the English
section oh that's not too bad ok cuz I
was gonna say like an instruction manual
this long brown a plug in a microphone
that would be pretty bad ok so i don't
know this isn't English this is the
second language in there oh yes analyzer
of course it's such airman first ok next
thing additional information ok some
more additional information in German
and here it is our expensive new
microphone system so I'll have to figure
out what everything in here does then
appears to be a box inside you probably
put some batteries okay see if I can
figure this up yeah hey Dad arese there
they go okay so the battery is going
this way and then that way so this is
either the transmitter or the receiver
they both look the same so oh no note
they're not the same okay okay I got it
I got it I got I'm on this see computer
stuff unboxing is a lot more comfortable
for me because I already know most of
this stuff and I don't actually have to
try to learn on camera because learning
on camera is very difficult so okay here
so this one is the transmitter because
the mic line is here I can also mute it
or i guess the cameraman could run up
and mute me if you felt like being a
jerk and and we've also got the
microphone itself which is here so this
is what i'll be using now instead of
that horrible thing there's a little
clip as well as a little little little
cover for the microphone i wish i had an
egg oh oh wait I do have a knife oh yeah
I have another thing to reveal in this
unboxing I have a new toy I have a knife
on my keychain now look at that I got it
at house of knives probably spent way
too much for it there but it was kind of
an impulse buy I was like oh yeah yeah
how's the knives i need a knife so i
went in and i got the knife okay there
we go so they've got a little cover for
the for the microphone go ahead and plug
that in there or cover that there okay
here we go so it looks like that there's
my microphone and it goes in that little
clip somehow maybe we'll do that too
it's all made of metal and everything I
was expecting it to be plastic okay um
so and i don't know maybe this goes
through here no
oh I see so it has to go through this
twisted coil somehow I think you know
what I'll figure that out later okay so
anyway we got our mic plugs in here
there let's keep this simple there we go
Mike there now opened it even screws on
look at that all right and then on this
side we have the receiver which goes
like this yep and that goes into the
camera man's camera if he had a way more
awesome camera which he doesn't so we're
actually going to use okay don't screw
that before I try to unplug it there we
go so we're actually gonna use this one
so all it is it's just a normal normal
like three and a half mil headphone jack
so you go ahead and unplug it or plug it
in here and then plug that into the
camera man's camera and then in theory
we are going to have much improved audio
in our future episodes of NCIS tech tips
I can try and turn this on but honestly
I don't know how so yeah I guess I'm not
really going anywhere with this there
the announcement today we have a new
microphone for NCIX tech tips be excited
the audio quality will be much improved
we hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
