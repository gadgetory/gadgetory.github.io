our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate Technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Nexus as I'm here at the Thermaltake
booth checking out their chow series
headsets I'm gonna pass you guys off to
Kitty ready hey guys I'm gonna say that
I lost my voice so that's why I sound
funny like maybe like a 12 year old boy
but it's over that hopefully you guys
can ignore that so I want to show you
guys a new headset that we have from the
chow series it's our new chow Drako
captain and this headset is actually
with white rock this is my first headset
with him we did a mouse with him if you
guys know our products we did a Saphira
Mouse so this has said well this series
let me tell you a little about the
series first so our channel series is
geared more towards music lovers and
lifestyle we you know we obviously have
headsets geared towards gamers but this
specific line the chow series is really
about you know DJs and music enthusiasts
so what's really cool about this headset
it kind of like blends and combines the
world of music lovers and gamers so
these are 50 Mill 50 millimeter drivers
they're really big your ear cups as you
can see so they're really great for a
long-term use have a tiny head so it's
not really a great comparison actually
wigs it hasn't look huge okay so for you
there we go yeah yeah they actually fit
yes and if you know a little bit of a
child's eyes Chow series don't really
have mics you know they're like I said
it's for music lovers so they're really
focusing on just you know long-term
musically so it's our first chow had set
with actually a mic attached so it's
really cool yes like but another thing
that the chow
series does is that the ear cups
actually flip so for people who are like
DJs or listening music you can actually
flip it and once you don't have to like
move it to the side you can flip one
side so you can hear people so you know
your friends can't talk anything bad
about you
No and then the side you can listen so
you can actually get over the child
captains - so the Chow assets are these
ones are $79.99 which is our or the
regular child's and then our child
signatures are kind of the premiums you
know they have the gold-plated and the
cable is removable so with the new
challenge captain headset it actually
has pretty much all the features of what
they have sets and it's priced at $79.99
so it's really kind of competitive price
the only thing it doesn't have is kind
of like the gold plate but I'm a bigger
fan of that kind of sleek sleek matte
look and it actually matches the Saphira
Mouse if you're familiar that right this
is very interesting so first of all as
you can see when we start first started
we have all these these different colors
of the Saphira mice so really all this
is is we've expanded upon the Saffir
series because everybody really liked
that Mouse you know it was a favorite
for a lot of people it's a favorite of
mine so we're really offering more
colors this year and you know different
finish the original Mouse is black with
the matte finish and these ones are
cloth so we have it in red the combat
green white yellow camouflage blue
orange just a ton of colors just because
we want to offer your you know
personalization with this mouse right
pretty much that's it you know all the
other features of the same nothing too
new but we definitely want to expand
upon a lot of the products that people
really like and give them more options
this is our gala rue I feel like I'm
just playing with it already can I stop
okay this is the gallery and this is a
mouse abundant she's so basically a
really simple idea you know you have a
bunch of cables in the back of the
computer and sometimes you're playing
with the mouse and so get snagged on
like your monitor or the side of your
keyboard or it will just get tangled in
the back of all the other wires so what
it really does is it just manages that
and makes sure that it doesn't get
snagged on anything yeah and it's you
can actually collapse it's a magnet so
just pop it into place and it's really
easy to bring with you if you're gaming
anywhere else but you just put it here
and you can choose however much slack
you need if you're one of those people
were crazy and they go all over the mask
you just yeah you put in there it
doesn't come out unless of course you
know you
but so you can choose how much slack you
need you know some people need a lot
like this or some people have a little
but that's bit it's just basically cable
management for your mouth it was for a
piece $14.99 nothing more frustrating
than getting most huh great before you
kill someone I get really pissed and
sometimes I'm just like mouse okay pull
it and it will just snap out of the back
which is really bad
never good things that I solve that
problem alright I guess we can move on
over to keyboards over here actually
Mouse the mouse that we affectionately
play it's a new it's just its colors
different colors so you can remember if
you know if you know instead of numbers
we use colors and letters that's not
what we're talking about here today okay
so the Volos mouse really is more for
people who are MMO gamers or people who
need a lot of like macros or hotkeys
this one has up to 14 macro keys
adjustable waist as usual profiles that
you can store inside the mouse we have
memory inside and of course the weights
of course I show you I can take out the
weights there's weights in here so
everybody likes that no I'm actually a
type of person who likes heavier Mouse's
well complain though some people like
it's too heavy I can't move it a little
bit bigger than most of our other
Mouse's a few mice
that's a very cool I claw grip but I
call grew up with really big mice
because I have a really big hand so
that's actually really cool because I
can still go all around the side does
have grip right along here and the
buttons are nice because you can easily
feel where each one is and they are
color-coded super really did this before
I was playing with the spouse actually
is the buttons right here there's
actually two right here yeah and I kind
of grip this way so I don't you know
it's like kind of perfect for where I
have it but I use actually like the
middle part of my thumb and it works
really well like I can hit here and I
usually use the buttons on the side like
for FPS gamer like when I prone or when
I with me way so those are kind
good bones I'm not even actually yes but
it's definitely we offer a lot more
buttons it's the most we offered on a
mouse and MSRP is $79.99 and we're
expecting for it to come out in the
spring we're really pushing towards
mechanical keyboards this year it's
getting really popular yeah sure I
wasn't gaming with mechanical keyboards
at first but it really has become really
popular in the last couple years I I use
mechanical and I can't turn back now
yeah once you try it yeah yeah so
basically what we're trying to do is
offer more options for gamers nothing
too crazy not like you know a bajillion
macros but you know we're starting slow
seeing what people like and then
building upon a good base so our
original Mecca and Mecca G units our
original Mecca g1 just had it's a pretty
standard layout and that the default was
black switches so now what we're trying
to do is offer more switches give people
more choices of what they like some
people like Reds some people like blues
Browns so we're actually picking those
up this year so we actually got our red
switches on the mecca G unit which is
back here if you want to play with it
might actually be how it is difficult a
key technique we have Reds and the one
key point I think everyone's been
waiting for at least me cuz I've been a
lot of people and asking me especially
want to go to eSport tournaments you
know like waiting for the our new prime
keyboard so this is our new Mecca g1
prize I've been looking this is our
keyboard made by team prime so
everything you see here the colors that
they chose and the layout is customized
by them and how they play the game so
it's in Korean - obviously good thing to
have English - cuz I wouldn't be able to
read it yeah but as you can see it has
their logo prime escape key yeah so any
time you try to escape you know it's
like up you don't escape don't escape
fight the battle very cool looking
keyboard awesome yeah these ones are
actually brown switches yeah I really
like the rounds they're definitely ones
that I think if you're a gamer who likes
to keyboard with you know that feedback
everything like super loud
I think Browns a good medium in the
middle to have but you know like we said
we have Reds we're gonna get blues and
we still have our blacks a lot of people
do like the black so what we did - is
for the mecca g1 this is a mech
when illuminated so now we're offering
options like backlighting yeah people
have been asking for backlighting right
now it's just red LED but maybe in the
future you will have more if people in
it so the MSRP for both of these are
actually one $49.99 you see right and as
you can see on this white one back here
they've got lighting zones that you can
set so these this one actually is it's
not fully lit it's just the special keys
you know like the WASD for FPS gamers
and then the arrows it's not all lit
it's just you know certain areas I think
some people they don't really like a
fully lit keyboard yeah I just want you
know the keys yeah yeah so so this one
is actually just certain keys but this
one is priced at one thirty nine ninety
nine USD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
