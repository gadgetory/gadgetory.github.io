we've shown before that buying from a
system builder can be a good way to save
yourself some hassle get extra warranty
support on your machine and thanks to
the economies of scale even save a buck
or two but who exactly should you buy
from well to answer this question
properly we couldn't rely on cherry-pick
samples where the system builder knows
who they're shipping to you know some
extra cable management here a touch of
extra overclocking there so as we
learned over the last couple of
scrapyard Wars you look like something I
know - that means that I couldn't be
involved in the process at all not even
to get on the phone so we devised a plan
we recruited agent Janice from
accounting equipped her with 1,500 US
dollars per system and gave her a simple
mission as someone who doesn't know that
much about gaming computers buy the best
gaming PC you can following the advice
of the PC advisers on the other end of
the line and I think the results here
are gonna shock you they're certainly
going to shock me because I haven't
heard any of this yet Ivan you got the
donuts and coffee because I think it's
time for me to have a good old-fashioned
stakeout let's do it team groups GeForce
Delta R GB SSD features a large luminous
RGB body with read/write speeds up to
560 megabytes a second check it out at
their thang miss sale in the link below
all right so we decided to go with two
different types of system integrators so
a big well known manufacture solar and
Packard okay a niche picture yep
then I'm envious already I see what you
did there so then we went with the two
high-volume manufacturers such as I
before and sir okay and then finally we
were antique yeah - boo dicks so we went
with the origin and we went with main
gear okay yeah I have a feeling we're
not gonna be making any friends over the
next half an hour or so here hold your
judgment like these people have never
heard of a computer before it's a gaming
type of a computer you heard it here
first
what what no second yeah yeah for those
who didn't know what is it three times
if you just try it do you just write us
a little up again holy fourth I'm poor
that's the best like a tower I just
learned it yeah so that's Canadian
dollars its he just like looking up
gaming computers on dell.com
he's been gone for 30 seconds yeah with
no elevator
he's back he's not even like hold on a
second where's they have up to nine
years where's he pulling these numbers
from like that there is no way that that
isn't out of the script you heard that
here first it's like 10 times faster
than the other one like 10 times faster
the other one great deals
but he's passing her off to someone yep
just a 461 multi-gpu approved with
liquid cooling does not have to Oh
because the K doesn't come with a box
heatsink but she doesn't leave that we
pulling and that also isn't the power
supply like what is he even talking
about like oh you also get that was his
job to tell her and he didn't until she
called him out and the price discrepancy
yeah you should say thanks for your time
cuz she gave him an awful lot of it
hi okay that's not bad a minute to reach
a person okay so location purpose budget
tells you right away there was a
discount but we don't even know what the
spec is like we don't even know if
that's a good deal and then so if I had
like about two hundred dollars to spend
are there any upgrades or things I could
do to make it like yeah he has all the
that's a pretty good question like net
monitors resolution yes oh but then he
didn't follow up and like what's the
resolution okay missed opportunity Oh
the warranty here no he has no idea how
hard she's laughing
let's see how many times that are I
gather how's it wait what
clearly doing it wrong what we still
don't know what the specs of the system
are they just said that's the link and
they said this is good for gaming didn't
specify there's Alissa did he send her a
link like is she looking at the system
or know he's getting your email now so
we still don't know what system were bad
but he already found her solution that
says is depress the best specs for
gaming and has a deal on it and he'll
feet within 2 grand let's see what he
sends so that's a gamble because if he
gets it wrong he looks like an idiot
and if he gets it right then we just had
a really streamlined experience that's
what it comes down to for this one all
right who's up next
Wow live person just picks up the phone
that's pretty good did I just hear it
right what there are sales people do not
do recommendations
totally understands 390 chipset
integrating yeah obviously which to be
clear is not us ripping on Janice that's
just like can't expect normal people to
know what that is okay so I'll call up
Chris Roberts from star citizen right
yeah Chrissy yeah you know like a game
that you haven't finished yet
oh well it's only been eight years that
fix card say Lisa that was it that's the
end of the cut in we'd just like you
can't even what even happened there
Thanks so what'd I get did we just not
buy a system like did CyberPower just
lose an actual sale because just to be
very clear to the viewer right now we
are spending our actual money to buy
these systems they actually get our
money and CyberPower just didn't get our
money because they couldn't pass the
most basic hurdle in the sales process
and I have money I need system you would
say I money give ezpz profit holy Sh now
agent Janice did four try and follow
what the guy just told her just sort of
systems by price and the site their site
is it cost oh yeah it's like looks like
a freaking Walmart fly or something you
know they imagine somebody with like
1,500 hard-earned cash just being
subjected to this
oh no just google it basically yeah
basically
I know I'm calling I'm looking into ok
well that's pretty good go straight to a
live person pretty much yes 10 seconds
is like bear your weight
yeah that's great okay
oh wow I can't believe it took this long
we are four sis in and this is the first
time we've been asked what games the one
ian has right now I know it seems kind
of average I don't know I think he's
necessarily
okay so it's a good thing it doesn't
take a long time to get a human because
you gotta call them back then they don't
send your your quote no quote again so
that's pretty good it only takes a
minute to get into talking to someone
again at least they
yeah well the previous session was like
more busy I guess so they actually were
put in the queue and over and over all
trim to call back yeah not too bad not
too bad the first call was so good but
this whole process is getting really
dragged out why don't they just give her
their email address and then stay on the
phone to make sure they get it so they
can reply to it like if you're ever not
sure that's like 101 level stuff if she
did get the quote he'd get a list okay
and they actually sent him a link to
their configurator with pre-selected
parts okay yeah and what was interesting
is 9000 series part is listed in it
really even though that's touched it has
the cost he sent us so so they're pre
selling it yeah so pre ordering
essentially but within a full system
interesting all right I mean there are
announced right but this guy's head for
sale with pricing I mean a system
integrator pricing but nevertheless you
got it okay alright so the beers go to
north modify anything just click as is
this what the guy told us okay hits fits
the budget let's go okay next next
system
let's be quick ten seconds from the
author outer to the live person okay
okay he's not trying to sell the paint
job too hard
see this is guys another way to do it
just have her look at it at the same
time yeah
she's guiding her through this site the
thing hundred dollars I mean that's a
good recommendation to upgrade but like
they say eighty six hundred K as an
upgrade what does she do it was eighty
four hundred what is she doing buying a
Z three ninety motherboard for an idiot
for a core i3 because ninety is bigger
than seventy okay for gaming maybe they
just brought them in right these guys
were doing pretty well until this
hundred and twenty gigabytes
whoa
that's it there is no storage in her
system at all hundred twenty you guys's
D for her that's right now I mean I will
say this I can understand based on how
much more click even though he doesn't
sound enthusiastic he does at least
sound knowledgeable his explanation of
the importance of the CPU and like what
it's for and all that suits the brain of
the computer she knows how to explain
it's like a vine so I can see why people
might buy from a boutique rather than
from a Tier one and certainly better
than I buy power
cyber certainly better than cyber power
but then they get Ivo power guy did know
what was up
he knew yeah what's up okay
okay the main gear like 15 seconds from
an operator to life person it's a good
question types of games
that's pretty I didn't know main gear
had systems that like 800 bucks I mean a
pretty sure it has AI three in ten
fifteen ninety I yeah but that's what
the 800 bucks
once you upgraded it should be decent
Wow she just got recommended an AMD
system Wow 1,500 bucks with that set at
$1500 you could really go either AMD or
Intel but the fact that he brings it up
at all RGV for gaming no GB bothers me
if it bothers you after a while you can
turn it off he said the f-word but I
think he said it in a pretty appropriate
future-proof is a fallacy now keep in
mind like this conversation is happening
after hours their office is officially
closed for business
really yeah he's except trying to save
your money
Black Friday Wow get a rise to save her
money
oh damn he just recommended go get a
cheap Wi-Fi adapter on Amazon I like
this guy oh here comes the warranty
pitch well he stay waits for the last
you know oh man all right
Deb's that's like the only anyone who
mentioned that he can save the config on
our site yeah in case you don't need
some time to think about it so I
wouldn't have expected one of our
boutique a size to be the most low
pressure straight talk
sales experiences so bottom line here is
main gear absolutely ran away with the
pre-sales experience I concur I mean
that was that was awesome
not good descending straight to the
point nope I like it
I'd say origin was really good as well
if we were ignoring the config after
that boy it gets tougher like HP was an
okay buying experience I guess - the
Pirates were like she was not told what
she's buying like ever - until she got
invoice yet and then I mean I buy power
if that had a bad connection I mean they
were probably fine yes and for your
benefit of a doubt no they just maybe
misspelled a letter the ones that really
lost here though Alienware and cyber
power those guys need to do better
straight up the NuForce be live five
