cooling loop was that it had gotten all
gunked up due to microbial growth in
spite of the fact that I am using primo
chill LRT that is why I can't even
remember what it stands for um huh well
there you go whatever the primo chill
antimicrobial tubing I thought it was
because I reused some of the segments of
tubing so they didn't have the coating
enough of a coating left anymore or
whatever else but I'm starting to think
it was to do with this block and not
anything else because you can see
there's weird text on the other side of
the block see that there's like graphic
design going on and it's not on the side
see here you can see under my finger
it's on the other side of the plexi and
this looks like some kind of a corrosion
or something see that's not a normal
nickel color so I'm going to be opening
up this block and seeing if I can even
clean it off and let's try and find out
what the heck is going on here so my my
new loop is going to be using a swift
tech block so one way or another
whatever kind of issue I know ek had
some nickel plating issues in the past
but I didn't think the GTX 480 blocks
were offended were affected so I guess
we're about to find out alright so the
cover has been removed and it's
interesting because I can I can read the
text now so something about Quinn
plastics calm and format t something
these are in other languages but that's
hilarious
so this is just yeah it's just gunk C so
I can scratch it right off but I guess
it was probably from the protective
layer that was over the plexi before it
was applied and that somehow left like a
slight residue in the shape of the text
so here there's a phone number so plus
four four zero two eight six seven seven
four eight eight six
and then I wonder if there's something
after that doesn't look like it so yeah
there you go so you can reach Quinn
plastics and ask them about it if you
really want to I suppose now let's have
a look at the block itself so this is
where we start getting into whether or
not this block is corroding I mean that
looks an awful lot like metal
discoloration to me but until I pick
away at it a little bit here I'm not
going to know for sure everywhere else
kind of looks ok oh hold on is that that
one's not coming off here hope you guys
can see this I wonder if I can switch to
macro mode in the middle of filming I
don't think I can here I'm gonna switch
to macro mode okay we're in macro mode
now so I haven't really tried to clean
it off yet but there's that one and then
here's the one over here right there
that doesn't seem to be coming off so I
wonder if there were some imperfections
in the nickel plating here I'm going to
try and clean it off completely now and
see what happens going to have to remove
the block from the card in order to do
that as well so I'm in the bathroom now
got my ax
got my block here got an old toothbrush
that's got some alcohol in it so that
might at least help me clear away some
of this gunk which it doesn't seem to be
doing this is uh this is some pretty
robust gunk we got going on here huh
it's funny because it no no that doesn't
come off that easily does it that's
having some success with it before I
hope you guys can see what I'm doing
yeah not really okay I'll move it a
little closer there we go we'll call
that good enough yeah no that's not
trying off at all what try it like a
little bit more scrubbing power no that
is a pretty stain block yeah you can see
I've got actually yeah that takes off
the top layer of it so let's just do
this one bar
barr√© wave on my real clock there we go
so you can see that the metal itself is
is discolored there so there you go I
will not be reusing this particular
block under any circumstances and yeah
so that's a shame
well thank you for checking out this
little discovery episode of my video
blog don't forget to subscribe to my
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos it looks like
there's actually a few of these there's
one here yeah you can see that there's a
couple places here here and here where
it seems like there's very very small
imperfections but then just from the
water flow carried carried away some
metal particles that deposited
themselves onto the nickel looks like up
here was kind of bad and thinks there's
a couple more marks in there anyone
knows more about metal than I do feel
free to chime in and suggest how this
might have happened remember this is
nickel plated copper and I think we're
done here
actually one more thing guys I should
note that it's been quite a while since
the ek has had these problems with their
block so this video was just more for
the sake of that I was working on it
anyway
so I figured I might as well shoot a
video about it it's not a warning about
ek products they've they've tightened up
the quality control on their nickel
plating processes so many recent blocks
should be fine however if you do have a
480 or 470 blocks something from this
generation of products might be
worthwhile to have a look in your loop
and if your case is closed make sure
that you don't have any gunk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
