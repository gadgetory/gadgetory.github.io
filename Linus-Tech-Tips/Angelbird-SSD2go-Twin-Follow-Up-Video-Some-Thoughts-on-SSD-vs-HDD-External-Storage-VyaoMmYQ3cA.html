more welcome to my follow-up on the
angel bird SSD to go I promised I'd give
my impressions of actually using the
drive when we were at Computex we needed
something that was large enough for us
to be able to store video data that we
created while we were at the show we
needed something that was fast enough
that we could realistically work off of
the drive itself so we could easily move
premiere projects from computer to
computer rather than waiting for file
transfer onto local Drive make changes
then transfer back we wanted like a copy
that everyone could work on and everyone
could sort of pass around and actually
use and then we wanted something that
wasn't gonna break and that was where
the angel bird came in because watch
this I would never even begin to
consider doing that to a hard drive
because its SSD based it is expensive
but it has a few other benefits so
there's that there's also speed so I did
question their use of USB 3 type-a
connectors back when I did the original
unboxing but I found out why that was so
it doesn't benefit speed in any way a us
a microUSB connector will do exactly the
same sort of data transfer speeds as a
full-size connector but what it does do
is it improves the robustness of the
drive so I'm just gonna show you guys a
quick look yeah Oh Windows 8 so we're
gonna do a quick speed test for you guys
to show you that particular benefit but
like I said that wasn't the reason why
they chose that Wow 320 330 megabytes
per second around 300 is where we're
hovering so that wasn't the reason that
they ended up choosing that particular
approach it was more to do with the
robustness
if you guys have been watching me for a
while you'll probably already know I
hate micro USB I think it needs to die
in a fire and it's not rugged enough for
devices we use everyday if you bought a
USB Drive and it came with a micro
connector on it you'd probably throw it
back at the clerk who sold it to you
saying well hum plan it's gonna plug it
in soon it's gonna break off so
something like a storage device that
you're expecting to use several times a
day obviously needs to be validated for
many plugs I
bird was able to validate the USB type a
connector for three thousand-plus plugs
whereas microUSB even the most expensive
connector they could find they were only
able to validate for around 350 so think
about that when you're choosing an
external drive so anyway our use case
scenario I thought we were going to use
the two separate drives remember these
are two separate drives inside two
separate USB controllers two separate
everythingÂ´s they're basically bolted
together I thought we were gonna use
them for redundancy but we ended up
using them more for organization so team
a used the purple drive and Team B used
the black drive and because it's fast
enough we were able to use this as a
working copy so the angel bird could be
kind of tossed around the room passed
from person to person if you needed to
work on a project rather than copying to
the computer working on it copying back
to the computer that way everyone had
the most up-to-date versions of whatever
it was that we happen to be working on
the drive does run a little bit warm but
that's to be expected so much like the
HTC One versus galaxy s4 conversation
where the Galaxy s4 doesn't feel as hot
in your hands and doesn't make your palm
sweat but the processor throttles
sometimes whereas the HTC one feels
warmer but is actually running cooler
that's the kind of situation you get
with an aluminium construction like this
now other than that the only real
advantage that we found was just in
terms of the ruggedness being able to
carry it around with us transfer footage
being able to toss it back and forth not
having to worry about it breaking Ram
that that's pretty much it so I think it
comes down to the conversation of guys
do you think that SSD based external
storage is at the point yet where you
would think about investing in it
bearing in mind it's much more expensive
than mechanical based external storage
or is it still at the point where you
look at it and you go that's a very
niche product I'm not interested in that
even if it is fast enough to work off of
directly attached to the computer and
even if it is more rugged and robust
than a hard drive based solution so
thank you for checking out my follow-up
on the angel bird SSD to go twin don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I think we're pretty
much done here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
