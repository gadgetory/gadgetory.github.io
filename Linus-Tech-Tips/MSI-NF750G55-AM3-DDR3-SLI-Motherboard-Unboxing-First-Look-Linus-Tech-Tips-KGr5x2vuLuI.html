unboxed an msi board and the reason for
that is that I haven't had any sort of
really interesting like really
interesting new stuff to unbox from them
lately but today I've got the NF 750 G
55 motherboard this is an nvidia nforce
sli board it's an enforced 750 board
which is something there's almost none
of on the market so that's why I grabbed
this because right now this seems to be
the best value SLI board on the market
so it's a it's a pretty unique
motherboard in that respect why don't we
get this thing opened right up let's do
a quick sort of highlight of what
features they are gonna call out here so
you got your easy OC switches for
successful OC active phase switching
okay power saving and then some
something about lossless audio awesome
okay so let's get this open into though
it's also Windows 7 ready check that out
very good
so it supports phantom 2 X force and
everything under that I'm going to go
ahead and assume you've got support for
ddr3 memory on this motherboard but
we'll get to that later first of all we
will find the drivers and utilities DVD
pretty much don't use anything on there
you're gonna want to download the latest
off the MSI website then here we will
find the quick installation guide which
is quite big but the reason oh wow
they've actually got like everything on
here they show you how to do the CPU how
to do the RAM how to do the IDE and see
the optical how to install graphics card
how to do the front panel connectors
that's great we give you a little
diagram there that's really handy ok
they show you the power settings
installation Hey they only show you the
24 pin power don't forget to do your 8
pin all right so we'll go ahead and
close that up I'll do that later okay
then we have the MSI NFS 750 G 55 user
guide so that's the detailed guide again
it's in a bunch of languages shows you
all of the ins and outs of this
motherboard oh that's yeah isn't
differently we just take it then we have
an SLI bridge what kind of SLI
motherboard would it be without an SLI
bridge you can see the spacing looks
like a 4 slot facing based on that
bridge but since it's a flexi bridge who
knows then we have our i/o shield then
we have gone gray IDE cable house
idiot then we have a molex to SATA
adapter and one SATA cable so the
assumption MSI seems to be making here
is that users will be using a DVD
optical IDE drive and then a SATA hard
drive or SSD drive again
alright then we've got our little
environmentally friendly paper packaging
followed up with some environmentally
not friendly phone but what are you
gonna do you got some plastic here let's
take this off and have a look at the
layout of this board now like I said
this is one of the most aggressively
priced SLI boards on the market right
now so you're not going to find
necessarily all of the features you'd
find on a more on a more high-end board
but you do have the EZ OC switch alright
so I'm not actually sure where that is
but here's the little button for it it
shows like a little gear shifter thing
that's pretty cool
and then you've got the power saving
features okay activation so let's take
that off alright general layout your SLI
slots are one two three fo they're only
three apart but you've got two PCI
Express 16 you have two usable PCI
Express One X and one PCI slot that
you're only really going to be able to
use if you're not using another card so
you don't have much on this board in
terms of expansion slots especially if
you're running SLI however if you're
only running one card you're gonna end
up with a couple PCIe ones of PCIe 16
which can be used as 16 8 4 or 1 and
then you've got a PCI slot so that's not
actually too bad down here you've got
three USB headers which I really like to
see I hate seeing only one then you've
got a onboard power switch you know what
MSI has really stepped up to the plate
here
they are putting onboard power switches
on most of their boards which is
incredibly handy when you're
troubleshooting I love that
alright then over here we've got five
SATA ports which may seem like an odd
amount but I'm gonna go ahead and guess
yeah there we go that we have eSATA on
the back and that's where your sixth
port is here is our chipset your prime
I'm just taking a wild guess here this
is an end force chipset you're probably
gonna want to do what you can to keep it
cool alright then you've got support for
like I said before a dual channel ddr3
memory here along the right-hand edge of
the board in its ideal location as your
24-pin power and then up here I
mistakenly said this would
an 8-pin this has a four pin power
connector this is an AM three ready
board obviously because you do have
support for ddr3 and you do need an AM
three chip in order to take advantage of
ddr3 this is actually oh I really like
this check this out this is a really
sort of beefy looking valve erm cooling
solution for such an entry-level board
and I really like the way that they've
sort of built it around everything in
there it's it's the little touches you
know that's where that's where a
motherboard can really stand out because
they've all got the same basic features
but it's just those little things right
here is the EZ OC switch which I'm not
sure how to use I've never seen this one
before their new thing is OC Genie so it
seems like this is kind of the more
value option okay this supports SLI and
hybrid SLI oh yeah so this has onboard
video check that out okay we've got a
couple ps2 ports one for the mouse one
for the keyboard we have VGA DVI and
HDMI out then we have six USB ports one
Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio there's
the back of the board you got your a m3
backplate and there is your serial
sticker thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the NF 750 G 55</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
