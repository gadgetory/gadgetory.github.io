experiment with Linus and alex this time
our victim is going to be the Delian
where area 51 M so this is notable for
having a desktop 9900 k-8 core processor
in it that runs at a hundred degrees at
all times so we are going to be trying
to tame the beast but there's going to
be a couple of key differences today DIF
number one they kicked us out of the
boardroom so we're in the kitchen and
DIF number two we have hello Stephen
Burke from gamers Nexus so let's see
what we can do with this thing with
glass where you can instantly see your
current and past Network activity detect
malware and block badly behaving apps on
your PC or Android device use offer code
Linus and get 25 percent off glass wire
at the link below
this is a lot of gear why is there a
calculator he never goes anywhere
without his ti-84 a serious phone yeah
okay so we're not gonna know what or how
we can mount an alternative cooling
solution to this thing until we've
opened it up and figured out exactly
what kind of mounting holes Gelles using
we require mounting holes that are quite
close to the socket we don't know if
we're gonna find that inside yeah we're
not going to I'm trying to put some
suspense in the video Alice I know that
so is this CPU and GPU are they exposed
on this side yeah they are okay does
your plan to leave the motherboard
mounted in the laptop yeah the other
option is you sit up for curiously on
its side and we just look at the screen
like this while the coolers hooked up
like that yeah do you know the story of
my chiller I bought this for the sole
purpose of hooking it up to my daily
driver East 6600 and you can tell that
it's very did it ever hurt anybody
17 year old me engineered it has not
hurt anyone yet but the possibility of
being hurt is definitely real so I would
ask that while it's plugged in you
refrain from touching this is this a
ground terminal any of the bare leads
here yeah yeah that's just hanging there
okay you don't need ground we don't see
ourselves as being grounded type people
okay neither of us wants to use our
liability insurance yes what I think is
going to have to happen is we're going
to take these
really really cheap blocks okay and the
machine a new piece of acrylic that'll
fit the mounting holes does this this
doesn't have any micro fins does it no
it's just a flower oh no it's like four
dollars on Aliexpress what do you want
man maybe six dollars on Aliexpress I
don't know I fix it's gonna hate this I
couldn't find the Marlin so this is
their old precision perspective you go
I'm assuming there's no IHS on the cpu
right so it's literally a desktop okay I
know right is it socketed yeah Oh
interesting I didn't know that so it's
it's 210 millimeter heat pipes on the
CPU and then GPU is here yep what is the
GPU full-blown you saw the CPU is 100
degrees was that only what the overclock
and I'm assuming okay one of the things
that we're probably gonna have to figure
out because having a look at the cooling
solution here
Stephan identified that there's actually
a fair amount of erm cooling going on so
they're not just cooling with CPU but
this aluminum plate right here is
actually making thermal pad contact with
the MOSFETs and the inductors all of
this interesting so Alex this is gonna
be a little bit tricky we're gonna have
to get air flow onto this heatsink
somehow even if we do just go with the
stock solution is that this back in here
is the GPU gonna be under a chiller also
yeah such other like what is like zero
degrees it's whatever you want it to be
maybe okay so it's been a couple hours
ah where are you at
we're good to cut things so it looks
kind of stupid this is the GPU one it
does look kind of stupid it's it looks
like you screwed it out and because we
just moved our router yeah
I don't know how accurate is at the
moment and until we test that I'm just
making all the holes way bigger so
hopefully it fits anyway you have the
o-ring groove and everything sort of oh
right there's no groove yes no groove
just flat so we're just gonna reuse the
stock o-ring that came with our Chinese
block yeah how does this compare to how
organized and professional you thought
we were Steve that way
I deserve that hey I get to be the
coolest-looking 1:200 know what up there
you go so that's our cpu mount right yep
cool sorry Steve it's not as bad if
you're making the noise which is why I
always volunteer for tap duty that's
right this one's a bit off but I think
we can just drill through it and it'll
be fine the PCB or the filler top isn't
it gonna be beautiful when you have the
mill and it'll actually just be like
warm how much was it again
5k oh god no I don't know good enough
heck yeah woah it's not perfect but
that's not what we're going for the
label on this bin really does not bode
well for the water cooling process sorry
Steve I promise we'll get to the part
where we really need your expertise the
overclocking very soon just got a you
know fabricate some crap to up like a
vise to secure the block no I had that
would you like to use it no no I'm good
thank you
just making sure I'm gonna go back to
writing my scripts for your next video
yeah wow I wonder if this is how like ek
waterboxx makes theirs yeah hey
definitely do use the drill by hand
right through the top oh that was gnarly
why is Alex not wearing gloves bed- has
to protect his little baby hands that's
why we're getting close then aren't we
yeah hell yeah actually we have a lot of
crap on the floor
Steve around the thing there there's a
Dyson I know that you're really good at
vacuuming I saw you did a review once of
a vacuum cleaner is the money still in
it it is vacuum
it's not sucking up the dirt we have to
cut a new one Alex that's not gonna hold
well alex is recutting our GPU acrylic
top we're gonna mount our CPU block as
best we can so in order to make our
lives a little one of those are you
throwing paste is gonna be better
thermally those are just good for their
endurance because you can use it a long
time actually lying down the middle you
know it just for you
wait what this is the sky like X
technique sir I've read that smiley
faces improve the thermals a bit okay
how much are you putting on here just
gonna squish out exactly who's gonna
clean it no I won't be here - one of my
longest standing sponsors is thermal
grizzly dough needs to be worth their
whole face does he spend more work it
back I'm all about the legal technique
so what do you think looks really ghetto
but like any good way so our expectation
right now turn on if this will turn on
yes okay I want to throw that heat sink
back on there yep three two one wait oh
I saw flash on the keyboard
oh no it's powering up battery that
sounds like it wants a battery man okay
sure let's try putting a battery in okay
you can screw that down no it's fine
like at least one you gotta hold the
heat sink do you want to hold the heat
sink Alex oh it's the heat sink no one's
holding it okay are weary I'm er weary
assembling it at this point like no saw
flicker yeah fans do like one rotation
and stop so basically here's what
happened the problem was that the memory
slots are actually labeled one two three
four which is pretty difficult what's a
little less typical is that it wasn't
booting with memory in slots one and I
guess it would have been four apparently
the system is firing up so all that's
left now is to retighten up our CPU
block mount our GPU block and then
finally one day late
leverage the talents of Stephen Burke
here and might actually do something now
how about we start with just a little
below ambient stay about the dew point
okay yeah I'm gonna lift this up and we
are going to put this in there okay you
can see this well-crafted cutout right
here yep
that's for this right here okay all
right perfect thank you don't cut
yourself that's some very rusty metal
okay
tubing here's some scrap tubing we had
lying around with a fitting in it's not
a race Alex well if it is I'm winning
it seemed fun
well let's maybe give it one minute I
mean remember these our line is tapped
holes also one of the first fittings
that you put on just didn't have an
o-ring really so are you sure it didn't
come off or something no I really did
check it's just drawing the cables into
the fans so they're shredding the cables
leaving which is creating strands of
cable sleeving that get into them more
easily
wait what what's going on it's good
solution there Wow only if it works
we've got our water cooling working our
temperatures are great at idle we're
what like 15 degrees 15 and 13 on the
GPU and we're at 6 Celsius on the
chiller wonderful except for one small
thing no matter what we do in the
extreme tuning utility I'm using air
quotes here it's not applying we're
getting lower scores in the CPU testing
3dmark so we've got core ratio overrides
for one to eight cores do you want to
just set those in here no we'll do that
next to you if we can okay alright so
after painstakingly applying they're in
BIOS overclocking settings we are
supposedly at 5.2 gigahertz on any load
up to six cores and then four point nine
four seven and eight core loads but
we're pretty sure that this is nonsense
so ideally with overclocking the biggest
limits you run into are thermal and
potentially voltage which triggers
thermal and then power limits and so
we're running out of power which I know
for two reasons one is because hardware
in 464 tells us we're hitting power
limits and the other one is because you
can see the cores throttling but we're
well under TJ Matt the issue then is
that when I try to increase the power
limits here and it doesn't look like
they've really changed from that BIOS
change when I increase the power limits
next to you it just says you can't do
that or it increases them in such a
small way that doesn't do anything
useful for us
alright well see what happens yeah I was
gonna tell you this clearly isn't
working because we're at 246 Lots we got
higher than that before alien where's P
overclock here is actually doing nothing
so they're pretty overclocks actually it
is 52 on six cores but it's
she doing 4.8 on all course so let's
just manually tell it to do 49 X and
then I want to change these but I don't
think it does anything based on what
we've seen so let's just run this as a
baseline and see what the cores are
doing so amusingly enough turning our
clock speed target down to 4.9 but on
all course actually yields slightly
higher power consumption and and a
higher score a higher score yeah and so
the reason this happens for anyone
doesn't know is because when you you set
the the configuration to aggressive but
your power throttling it's throttling
harder to try and account for that so
you might actually drop your multiplier
from something like 49 X down to all the
way into the 20s or 30s right I'm gonna
increase the cash ratio now a general
rule of thumb is I like to keep cash
ratio like maybe 4 ticks below all core
but we're gonna push for maybe 47 acts
and see if that holds and this is also
known it's a reboot required annex to
you on this laptop it seems like reboot
required basically means it's not gonna
work
no wonder you prefer working with
desktops at least they're designed for
this sort of thing I think this is
designed for it I think so too
I think Alienware had this in mind so
after beating our heads against the wall
turns out there's a new bios for this
laptop
apparently enhanced the performance of
the system perfect Thank You BIOS
engineers hopefully this gives us a bit
more control oh hold on a second no this
is good power limit one is 210 watts now
oh yeah that's the change okay I have
some hope now cuz if we can get another
60 watts that should be substantial yeah
I doubt you're gonna be able to actually
change it it's a two hundred and thirty
or whatever yeah I don't think that's
happening then I guess I should know it
as well I did drop the chiller a bit
more so I forget where we're at about 10
degrees Fahrenheit I don't really use
Fahrenheit despite being American so I'm
not sure what that is but our load temps
were around 50 to 55 degrees across all
course we're below zero Celsius is what
really matters so so we're expecting a
better result this time because we got
up to almost 250 watts here okay good
for the full system CPU temps are also a
touch higher in the mid-60s so it's
definitely working harder so we're
changing power management
for the GPO to performance instead of
optimal power we're changing texture
filtering from quality to
high-performance kingpin OGS all those
real overclockers do this it's
permissible so we've got that done it is
actually at what was it 290 yeah okay
well that's very promise this is better
than the first BIOS for sure yeah and we
haven't touched voltage yet so if we
have 2 over volt we might be able to
it's just gonna get power limitation
issue you know what right when you said
that it peaked at 300 so 300 is gonna be
our new maximum power it looks like used
to throttle stop to bypass these
throttling schemes is at your own risk
and can result in permanent damage to
your power adapter or computer perfect
I'm applying the setting it's saying
reboot required I hit this card I apply
the setting and then it worries and if I
reboot it doesn't work it gives an error
message it's helped with 295 it's
holding up there longer our frequency
was actually like 50 the whole time and
I technically applied 51 but I don't
know if it actually worked
10 6 79 so this is the error that we get
every time we try to actually listen to
the software and reboot and then it just
doesn't apply anything that was changed
yep in fact it reset everything else so
after playing around with all the dials
and XTU it turns out that the only thing
that really changed with the BIOS update
was that the default power limit is
higher the good news though is now we
can start pushing our GPU which we
should be able to get a pretty good
overclock on right yes so GPUs and video
GPS especially are really temperature
dependent and for about every maybe 5
degrees Celsius you drop you'll keep
getting frequency increases without even
doing any work we do not have a lot of
time we're starting to sweat yes air
will create condensation so I would
limit their access to components worst
case scenario Alienware gets back a
laptop that doesn't work so 11 to 36 we
are up on graphic significantly
some success so we are up from 10,000
201 211 236 about 10% and 7 degrees on
the GPS after running so then let's get
this back towards the BRM perfect how
how does that it's getting warm yeah
memory was getting a little bit toasty
too and our memory has shoved under
there I think so that's I would like to
get a fan kind of this direction oh we
need to do we need yeah slate the CPU a
bit well that's the best I think we can
really hope for right now I'm gonna put
some more towel around the fittings up
here at the top yeah if the compressor
still running
are we still bringing this down yeah you
know I'm good
I think we're gonna call this the limit
cuz we're starting to sweat more than
I'm really comfortable with we're gonna
start getting drops running down the
tubes onto the motherboard here pretty
soon so you crank did you crank it all
the way so this is basically it this is
what we're going for plus 180 on the GPU
core plus 1120 on the GPU memory and 5
gigahertz on the CPU now to be clear
there are other things that Steve could
do if you had more time tuning the clock
speeds for individual cores because I
mean 3dmark especially when you're
running a GPU test actually doesn't hit
all the course so you could avoid a
power limit by not running all of them
at 5 gigahertz so we have well over a
10% improvement yeah not not bad what
are our GPU and CPU temps look like I
see is that 9 on the GPU I see over here
CPU so max was about 74 degrees Celsius
so and then the GPU we don't have it
logged actually we do the max was 28
degrees degrees really not bad that's
awesome so anyway I think we can be
happy with this knowing that within the
the time and the software parameters we
unfortunately have we're at eleven
thousand four oh six versus ten thousand
hundred eighty-six so that is way
outside of margin of error we've
actually improved it yep the graphics
cores eleven thousand six fourteen
that's the CP it wasn't really that
great it was ten 360 so we it could
improve there there's a throttling issue
so settings GPU core offset was 160
megahertz memory we did 1120 megahertz I
tried 1180 I tried 1220 both of
is really heavily artifact sedan crashed
maximum performance mode in the power
management for nvidia drivers we changed
texture filtration the high performance
from quality which is allowed so that's
it massive thank you to Alienware for
permitting us to do this to their
mission they didn't permit any of this
but thanks to Steve for coming out and
having some fun with us there was a lot
of fun time laptop extreme overclocking
yes very fun and very impressed with
Alex's CNC turnaround on the blocks
extremely quick water cooling solution
for a you know laptop that's it's gonna
be a new business opportunity for us I
think create custom laptop water blocks
all the money in that speaking of lots
of money in that ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction and
with ting you pay only for what you use
with the average ting bill coming in at
just $23 a month per device they have no
contracts and you can try it risk-free
and if you're stuck in a contract with
your existing carrier and you switch to
ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 they've
gotten nationwide coverage from coast to
coast in the USA and data is now just
$10 a gig beyond the second gig they
never block throttle or interfere with
your online access and you can find out
how much you'll save on ting by going to
Linus ting comm and trying out their
savings calculator we used their
voicemail to text service and published
our number one eight three three five
six five Elsie TVM to hear some messages
from our fans I unfortunately don't have
access to think here in the UK but I
would love to get it would save me
roughly around about 10 pounds if you
were to convert it so I really hope
you're able to come over here into the
UK so lower your phone bill at Linus
ENCOM and get $25 in tin credit we'll
have that linked below so thanks for
watching guys if you just liked hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed especially to Steve you can
find him over at gamers Nexus there is
no apostrophe even though it seems like
maybe there should be the don't stress
about it also
what else oh yeah you can check out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description I
wouldn't recommend using it like this
also down there is our merch store and
what the hey why don't we put Steve's
merch store down there as well you have
these mod mattes again yet they will be
here pretty soon yeah okay well and we
have the medium ones now so these things
are fantastic whatever your tech project
is whether you're working on a computer
like him or a mobile phone or whatever
just call me a computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
