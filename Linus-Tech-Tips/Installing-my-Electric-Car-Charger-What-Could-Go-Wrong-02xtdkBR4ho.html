this kit that like kind of like Lego for
batteries kit that we found online
to make a DIY lithium battery to soup up
my kids Power Wheels car you know this
little ride on cars for kids that make
it make it go real fast
and that project along with some really
great positive feedback that I got from
the electrician and engineering
communities really made me feel like why
stop there I think we're ready for the
big time so as some of you know I
recently got myself a little car upgrade
I went from my 2003 Honda Civic to a
plug-in hybrid 2017 Chevy Volt and one
of the things that you kind of need when
you have an electric car is an electric
car charger so today we will be
installing this 240 volt charger is it
240 volt and yeah don't worry I'm not
doing it by myself this is Brian he's an
electrician he's gonna help the t46
caliber RGB ddr4 ram uses a unique totem
pattern design and ultra-wide 120Â° panel
lighting find out more at the link in
the video description
so step one is why I actually feel the
need to install an electric charger by
the way this is this is charging land
this is the corner of my garage where I
make sure there's nothing flammable
because I have one of those old
hoverboards here and you just you just
never you just never know what those so
this is the the wall charger that's
included with the Volt so it runs at 120
volt and it charges at a maximum of
about yeah there it is about 1,400 watts
which quite frankly is lots for a
plug-in hybrid if I had this running at
full capacity I could easily charge it
up overnight but as some of you might
remember from the video where I talked
about getting this car my intent is to
do car reviews on an ongoing basis
moving forward so if I were charging up
an actual full electric car this would
be painfully slow so I think the first
question the audience is gonna have for
you is you're a real electrician right
like not like out like a lioness media
group video host pretending to be an
electrician no okay good
so then you helped me pick out this
particular this is a level 2 charger is
that correct
yes and can you explain to our friends
out there what the difference is between
a level 1 and a level 2 charger while I
go ahead and open this baby up basically
it's just the amount of power that I can
shovel into the car so you know a level
1 charger like what you're using right
now plugging into 120 volt receptacle
you're only pulling about 1400 watts
something like this will run off a 30
amp circuit at 240 volts so
theoretically you can charge about 4
times faster cool and we went with one
from Siemens it's a shame they didn't
try that try that company name out in
English before they seem ins merci merci
charge and why did we pick this one
frankly it's what the wholesaler had in
stock
wow you really are a contractor this was
a little overkill for this application
wasn't it yes I'm a nerd and so you were
like well the difference is only you
know three dollars and you know this is
better and I'm a nerd and I love
overkill I knew it
no I just know where it's going and well
in the ceiling so we interrupt this
program to bring you stunning footage of
the damage that dennis has done to my
house
there's the brand-new hole in my ceiling
of my garage that we have not intended
to put there can we pull this panel off
so we can show the busbars sure okay
let's do that just don't touch the shiny
I'm not gonna okay so our plan is I
think I think all the access holes are
kind of in use here
oh wait nope I see one but this looks
too big for it dang dang it you and your
overkill Brian that's what the rules are
for okay alright so let's let's let's
let's get a move on then that this is it
right installing a armored cable with
this you can either go surfaced yeah in
the garage last week this week or yeah
like you're originally talking you can
run it through the attic space yeah so
that's what we're gonna do
Reilly Murdock what if I told you that
not far from where you're standing one
of your compatriots fell through the
ceiling dark
okay so you're gonna stick a screwdriver
up yes okay can you see mr. driver right
there
ah III have you met my friend mr. pokey
now you can poke something through a
hole okay can it be black and really
thick I really say yes yeah you are and
properly she's it's ribbed for her
pleasure gosh it's really long
that's good okay you badmouth Heather
I mean basically the idea is that we
might sell this place at some point and
I don't know which side whoever buys it
would want their electric vehicle on you
so I wanted it
somewhere in the middle accessible
enough that you could kind of run it
across the hood of this one or plug it
into that one so that that's basically
the entire rationale so I just I just
want it to be I mean if a hobbit like me
can reach it then I figure anyone can
reach it so I just wanted it to be
somewhere where you can get this down
some of usually pretty easily I can
reach that pretty easily so let's go
let's go like right up onto the drop and
then we'll just run our little board so
that we have something to screw the
bottom into does that work yep you want
to build it or do you want me to I can I
can build things I actually have wood as
well if we need any other wood my
workshop is equipped with all kinds of
things like safety glasses hearing
protection a staple gun
hey it may not be straight but it's 22
inches long right now so I think
okay - perfectly 22-inch exactly the
same pieces of wood with very
perpendicular ends oh yeah
close enough are you assuming I don't
have screws I have screws also I have a
level I have to I accidentally bought a
second one when I lost my first one you
know I'm using my level I'm not using
any of your tools anymore I'm going I'm
gonna get my drill aiming for
approximately centered here I have
screws
I got my own screws they are just as
good as your screws which grabs your
line they are actually slightly shorter
but not in a way that matters it's not
as thick either - hold on let me see if
I let me see if I have better screws
just a sec I'm gonna be right back with
better screws no what you know what
Brian fine you know that's the funny
thing else no no no who screw is longer
now bring yours back late that's the
same line us well and that's fine isn't
it okay I'm just gonna kinda eyeball
this like wait a minute whoa whoa why
are these two pieces of wood very
different links hold on a minute here oh
there's the other one
how's closed what would be funny though
okay no from my last vacation I
completely reorganized the garage put in
all the shelving and all that kind of
stuff and got it from this entire side
being completely consumed by all the
things that are in the overhead storage
and shelving yeah
- well now being able to park two cars
in here so what was that word you used
vacation yeah well ya know that well
that's how I vacation I like work that
was nice
okay oh yes I can do one goodies so
that's all the fun bits inside yeah this
this does seem to come right off
all right so now the part that I really
shouldn't do so yeah at this point
basically why you just kind of stick it
in there stick your conductors in there
and kind of you know cable manage it a
little bit maybe a little something like
like that remember always cut towards
your abdomen because if you're gonna
eviscerate yourself to make sure that
it's like really graphic well actually
you have more control towards yeah III
know I did make the mistake one time
with having my hand below where I cut
did you slip I did right through this
finger ouch if you look carefully you
can still see a line going I don't have
to look that carefully so you're going
at an angle there's unwrap it nope
so it's we're actually not gonna have to
unwrap it at all because once you go far
enough so then just kind of unthreaded
almost and then just lights off deputy
Bob just like that hey no no very cool
okay look at me I'm doing electrician
things Wow
electricity okay and then this blue one
I'll just kind of well not that we're
gonna actually tape up okay tape the end
up little caps I have the little caps
you could do the pedal you said you were
gonna tape it I was going to then you
went cap hunting so then I just grabbed
one you're having too much fun grinds
clearly isn't not anymore no this is way
too entertaining okay okay oh looks not
bad and I sort of did it myself this is
where I actually stopped participating
because I don't trust myself in there
I'm so supportive I feel like in a past
life I have this probably a brassiere
you know I also love being close to
breasts you know that's another
indication yeah this is being patched
before yep sure has that's cool yep so
has this part so has this part so has
this part yep
it's kind of a it's kind of a patchwork
you know house you ever considered just
putting a new she did right one nope Oh
what the hammer before you son
yes you just won't use my hammer look
how much better that hammer worked it's
nice hammer would you know wood
craftsmanship you have a fresh pack of
blades too but so do i I actually don't
I'm just you know we were comparing yeah
who was worried about it or than I got I
got carried away there okay
oh right you can't just like take it off
no it's the metal part that just slides
off okay oh wow it's so soft it's
actually like really easy to cut okay
huh
it looks tougher and more rigid than and
I guess it is yeah it's the armor that
makes it hard right okay so I need the
hex on there yeah
and then kind of that kind of angle yeah
yeah roughly a 45
are you okay so you're not supposed to
cut on the back stroke you can still run
it back and yeah you just want to make
sure you stay well fairly level both
okay no way kid
so this is a bit different style of
connector anyway tie in the bond yep
sure
proceed with the bond tying in okay cool
so okay so this blue one we're not gonna
need so we'll just cap that and chuck it
here or whatever out of the way yeah and
then next we put the breaker in so how
these work this is actually an old style
breaker these are well demanders yeah so
if you look on the back side of the bus
port here
yeah those little hiccups yes that goes
right in there exactly
cool okay so this lugs
so that's on and then these two screws
just tighten down into the bus bars yeah
sure no problem and is there a like is
there a reason that we haven't just
turned this off while we do this place
that would kill power to the entire
house
so that's what I do whenever I do
anything with the house worried you just
kill the main yeah I just I just put my
headlamp on well because they're not
very well labeled so I don't know what
yeah I guess that's true like when you
don't know what you're doing yeah you
know you just play it safe but it seems
fine so I guess you're fine
well cuz this like plastic and rubber
are insulators yeah so obviously you
wouldn't want to touch this you could
slip it like that I get your hand all
over it and like because I'm me so I'm
gonna keep doing it the way I do it okay
again if you strip too much we just nip
a little off chair they call me the nip
King I don't know about that pop it like
it's hot or a neutral ground actually
looks like something here's Oh up a
little bit of your breaker tripping or
something we'll put a earth flash
okay let's put it back exactly the way
it was without any further investigation
pretty fancy that's the coolest looking
Siemens I've ever seen
he's gonna do it go get run over now Oh
wrong pedal there
yes so my cats are both gone presumably
dead so the best thing I can do with
barreled toys is make my little
alignment thing here see that see that
parking job see how how nailed that is
so that means I can open my door up like
this and the sliding door the van and
there'll be about this much space nice
alright so here we go
unholster bring one loop down you know
what I'm probably gonna do is like just
a little straw or simple type it yeah
it's drop that in there or something
I have smaller strap so if you and pal
it's trudging oh I heard it kind of
click on there to look at it go well
make some noise there doesn't it this is
really giving it may not be RGB but it's
G let's cut the G part so I wonder how
long it's gonna take to charge on this
thing it actually takes more than
overnight on the low setting of the one
that came in the box and the reason I
use that is because I've got my
deep-freeze plugged into the same
circuit so I was worried that if that
kicked in and I was around fourteen
fourteen fifty watts or whatever it was
yeah it would turn off both of them and
my food all spoiled I'd be a problem so
I'll just wait until I get the proper
charger but this should charge this
puppy up in like two hours yeah cool
nice so that's pretty much it
