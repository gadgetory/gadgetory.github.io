phenom CPU where am i right why is my
shirt black hey hey hey whoa Oh what
where am I now Paul like I cut my own
media group cool Oh check this out
I've ride one of these sick
this must be my my office Wow look at
this thing it's this this is CPU Wow
look at the size of it rad ripper - is
it could it be the future no no it's not
the future it's today it's the AMD risin
thread ripper - 29.92 WX and it is right
now and our video about it is brought to
you by NCI I fix it I fix its new Mahe
driver kit includes their 1/4 inch
aluminum screwdriver handle with a
magnetic bit socket knurled grip and
swivel top with 48 driver bits check it
out at the link below
Soyoung - there came from a world where
the Intel core2 and AMD phenom x4 series
of quad-core processors had the highest
core counts among consumer products but
in the 10 years since then the situation
has changed a lot with AMD launching an
industry shaking 16 core thread Ripper
processor last year and then following
it up today with the debut of the 2990
WX a 32 core 64 thread successor now
they've created a ton of excitement
amongst both consumers and professionals
and they have sown a lot of discord with
their competition over at Intel who have
reacted to the disruption with their own
high-end desktop chips based on the same
DNA as their Xeon server lineup and then
this weird like 28 core demo thing that
they were doing at Computex this year
and then shortly afterward tried to hide
anyway hypetrain aside though one thing
that we know about thread Ripper -
before we even start testing it is that
this is not a gaming centric CPU I mean
even ignoring the 1300 and 1800 dollar
price tags when we dig even a little bit
further into the specs we find that the
WX series so these are the two new
high-end ones doesn't turbo up as fast
as its ex brethren the direct Zen +
replacements for last year's thread
ripper 1 of course with that said we're
still gonna run some gaming benchmarks
anyway so normally we actually breeze by
our test benches but this time there are
a couple of important notes so AMD has
created a really solid upgrade path for
their X 399 customers by allowing
existing boards like this Z
extreme from a soos to run the new chips
with nothing but a BIOS update but that
said a soos did have some concerns about
overclocking and up to 250 watt chip on
boards that weren't necessarily designed
for that so they equipped us with their
rog zenith extreme cooling kit you
shouldn't need this kind of thing for
stock operation or if you have excellent
airflow over your socket area already
but if you're overclocking we would
strongly recommend it all right the
first big surprise in our gaming testing
was discovering that thread ripper 1 is
actually faster in some cases in spite
of thread ripper two's higher clock
speeds even after multiple runs these
results persisted which might seem like
some kind of a mistake but as it turns
out the less sophisticated
first-generation precision boost
so that's AMD's dynamic clock speed
optimization engine kept the core clocks
higher more often with precision boost
to more aggressively utilizing its
intermediate clocks instead of being
either full out or clock down so we
actually ended up losing some raw speed
but what we're getting back in return is
more consistency another thing that
impacted gaming is you ma versus Numa
memory access modes now it's quite a bit
more complicated but in layman's terms
you ma is typically better for
multi-threaded workloads thanks to its
more consistent memory bandwidth while
Numa can come out ahead sometimes thanks
to a small latency advantage in lighter
ones it should be noted that only the
x-series allows you to decide which mode
you prefer WX only runs in nuuma mode
this was to retain intergenerational
compatibility and I would say that there
are probably some creator by day gamer
by night folks out there who are going
to be pretty pleased with the upgrade
path that AMD has provided here I mean
the 2990 WX isn't far and away the
fastest CPU in every
test that we ran blender which leverages
Intel's avx-512 extensions is a notable
exception and single-threaded tests are
obviously not as strong suit but this
this is one powerful piece of silicon
even Intel's marginally more expensive
79 80 XE is no match when thread refer
to WX gets to stretch its legs now on
the subject of stretching them let's uh
try some overclocking shall we now you
can still overclock thread refer to
manually but in theory anyway
AMD's precision boost overdrive allows
the user to simply set a higher power
budget and then watch while precision
boost to and xfr so that's extended
frequency range to do all the heavy
lifting only some of our workloads
actually improved in performance while
others straight-up regrets we think this
has to do with some kind of weird
thermal limit as indicated by the
identical 68 degree TDI reading at both
stock and overclock speeds in spite of
our beefy cooler but that may require
further investigation let us know if
you'd like to see a dedicated thread
Ripper to overclocking video for now
who's gonna grab this grab this baby
here's what we can say 32 cores in a
consumer or a prosumer or workstation
chip whatever you want to classify it as
sounds amazing it is exactly the
headline that AMD needs as a company
right now to gain valuable what's called
mind share where normal consumers are
more likely to run out and buy normal
Ryze and chips because the world record
holders and the influential content
creators that they admire are using AMD
in the real world though the potential
market for a product like this is pretty
limited now the 2990 WX is the high-end
workstation king but you need workloads
like heavy virtualization or 3d
rendering or gas exploration that take
advantage of it otherwise honestly
speaking
you'd be better off spending half as
much on a twenty nine 50x the 16 core
drop-in replacement for the older 16
core but now with Zen plus or looking at
Intel's lineup if avx-512 support or
single-threaded performance are also
important to you but maybe at the end of
the day it doesn't matter who it's for
maybe this was just about building an
amazing piece of technology and then
patiently waiting for the use cases to
show up because I mean if there's
anything that the history of computing
has shown us it's that if you breed a
faster horse someone somewhere is gonna
build a more challenging course it's
making a building something mass drop
has gone from just being a place where
you buy stuff to a place where you buy
exclusive amazing collaborative products
and the mass drop X - an 8350 headphones
use new dynamic drivers different from
what was used in the Aichi 300 resulting
in a more neutral sound signature they
feature a comfortable headband the lure
ear pads and a detachable cable and they
ship within two to three days check them
out today at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked it's hard to be an
Intel fanboy today isn't it so you guys
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured in the video
description also link down there emerge
