showcase at CES 2013 and I have a couple
pretty sweet desktops to show you guys
these are mostly oriented for those
Canadian viewers out there which of
course respect and all that because we
are of course from Canada as well
we have the ROG Titan CG 8480 this is
more like what would we equate it to
this is more like your your Ducati
motorcycle it's light its agile it's an
Ivy Bridge blade based platform so in
terms of specs you've got a GTX 680 so
to be clear this is still a very fast
machine of 3770k 16 gigs of dual-channel
ram you've got a trained blu-ray burner
and up to a 6 terabyte SATA 6 6 GB per
second storage solution available on
this guy
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
so looks very cool looks very sleek
well-built as we've come to expect your
power buttons right here you've also got
built-in Auto overclocking right here
but this is not the one that I am most
excited to show you guys this is the one
that you're more likely to be able to
afford and that's great but this right
here is the showpiece this is the Titan
CG 88 90 it has a 39 60 X that has Auto
overclocking as well more on that in a
moment it has a GTX 690 inside it's
actually on demo with what is one of my
favorite monitors pretty much ever this
is the PB 278 q this is a 27-inch 2560
by 1440 monitor uses a pls panel and it
is absolutely beautiful but back to the
system back to the system comes with the
128 gig SSD as well as a 2 terabyte hard
drive 16 gigs of memory and I think
that's probably a typo because that must
be quad channel memory not dual channel
memory you guys and check this out front
USB 3 USB 2 check this out check this
out ok ok ok so it's a 3.8 gigahertz now
I press the overclock button oh yeah
it's like weapons and stuff it comes out
of the side and then the spoiler is all
like whoa maybe this thing is going so
fast we got to keep it on the ground but
if you want to go faster this is at 4
gigahertz now you press it again it goes
to 4.2 gigahertz unfortunately like like
a dragon head doesn't pop out of the top
when you go to 4-point do gigahertz but
there's an idea for the Asus team who's
all watching me make this video not that
there's any pressure or anything like
that and oh yes we have insane cooling
vents so I want you to come around here
to the back and I know that's gonna mess
up all the diesels lighting solutions
here we've also Oh sounds ilnur sound
card in there is that dock very nice
comes with us own our sound card the
price is not for the light of heart but
check out this cooling you guys he's got
like vents coming up a back and it's
absolutely crazy but you throw extreme
edition processors and GT
six 90s in a machine you expect to want
to cool it down I think my comment to
the to the PM for this product was the
tooling on this must cost an absolute
king's ransom to produce something like
this like you guys out there the viewers
you guys have no idea how much time and
effort and money it takes for someone
like isus to bring something like this
to market and he basically said look
this is a luxury product it's worth it
and it's going to be available in Canada
come February so thank you for checking
out this video don't miss any of our CES
2013 coverage subscribe to Linus tech
tips and I'll see you guys next time
thanks for watching Linus tech tips at
