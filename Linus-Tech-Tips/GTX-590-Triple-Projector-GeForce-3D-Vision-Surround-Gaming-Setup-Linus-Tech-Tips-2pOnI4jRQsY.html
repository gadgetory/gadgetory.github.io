triple projector 3d vision surround
setup that I've got going here now a lot
of you guys in the NCIX tech tips
episode I produced recently complained
with where I did the 5 way 5 by 1
Eyefinity setup we're like oh well
there's too many bezels well here's your
solution see right now you can see the
geta the setup is very ghetto like I've
got racks with projectors on them and
then I've got basically a big white wall
that I'm using to to fire the mat so I'm
still going through the driver set up
getting nvidia 3d vision surround going
but I mean just for scale those are
speakers that's a printer box so that's
that's a like a laser printer box that's
how big this display is so uh stay tuned
you guys I'm gonna do sort of a few more
in-progress shots probably here and then
I'll upload this you can see the screens
are in a line just right yet I'm still
got some work to do but we're getting
there got my g25 racing wheel over here
somewhere yeah got that going gonna be
good alright guys here's another in
progress so you can see I still don't
really have the screens lined up here's
my test rig though and here we go if I
go into the Nvidia control panel you can
see man I gotta zoom in so far just to
even see the screen I've got the span
displays widths around I had to
configure it so that they'd be in the
right order but I have managed to get
that figured out so my desktop starts on
the Left moves to the right and then
ends at the very far right okay so
that's done what I have also managed to
get set up is the screen resolution so
the resolution we're running at is 3840
by 720 so this is basically three times
720p now 720p is not a big resolution in
terms of requiring graphics horsepower
to back it up but 3x 720p basically
works out to 2.7 million pixels so if we
compare that to some other common
resolutions like let's take 1920 by 1080
which is only about
two million pixels basically or let's
take like 2560 by 1600 so that's about
four million pixels so we're somewhere
in between running 1080p and running
like HD plus saw a 30-inch monitor
resolution here in terms of the
horsepower required now bear in mind -
but we are going to be running nvidia 3d
vision here's my 3d vision glasses so
that adds some extra burden on the
graphics card as well so you actually
are running at an HD plus resolution
with 3d vision so you're going to need
some serious horsepower such as say for
example a GTX 590 which supports 3d
visions surround natively on a single
card and yeah so I'm gonna just do some
more work here and then I'll be able to
break out like the flight stick and the
and the wheel so almost ready to go I
got just gonna line things up a little
bit better as well cuz that'll that'll
be kind of distracting during games so
I've pretty much got it set up at this
point there's one of my co-workers
playing around in Battlefield Bad
Company 2 so look look there's a person
for scale that's how big that images
evidently he's also not very good at Bad
Company 2 because he's like dying
already use your grenade launcher mouse
wheel down there you go fire that at the
truck there you go anyway so yeah yeah
we're getting pretty close to being able
to shoot this episode of tech tips and
what I may actually do is wait till it
gets a little bit darker outside because
this isn't really an ideal room for a
projector setup but thank you for
checking out my preview of the 3d vision
surround projector episode of NCIS tech
tips that will be coming very shortly
