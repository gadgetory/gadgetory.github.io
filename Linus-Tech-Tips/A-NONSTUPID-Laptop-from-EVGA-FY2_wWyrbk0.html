brands check them out in the length of
description down below
we're here at EVGA checking out the SC
15 you might be familiar with the SC 17
which is a previous 17 inch laptop that
they launched at maybe last year so yes
I'm pretty sure that's correct they have
now lowered the landscape of the screen
made it a bit cheaper hopefully it's
going to range from maybe somewhere
between 1500 and 1700 dollars they
haven't finalized their price quite yet
and that screen that I just mentioned
will be 1080p g-sync
120 Hertz IPS all running on a GTX 1060
remember the 1060 that's in here is the
same as a desktop class 1060 so you
should be completely fine for a huge
range of games at 1080p and a lot of
them should actually get relatively
close to that 120 Hertz setting if
you're playing things like probably
rocket leek and whatnot on the CPU side
of things they went ham they have a new
KB Lake 7700 HQ I paired with 16 gigs of
ram a one terabyte hard drive and a 256
gigabyte samsung n dot 2 SSD below that
screen is their chiclet keyboard which
features RGB LEDs because it has - its
2017 it must feature RGB LEDs on the
back of the screen there's a white LED
lighting up the EVGA logo and that can
be turned off if you don't want light
coming out of the back of your laptop on
the left-hand side you have power which
runs to their relatively large power
adapter an Ethernet port headphone and
microphone jacks and 2 USB 3 ports on
the right hand side you have mini
DisplayPort HDMI 2.0 USB type-c gen - 10
gigabit and a singular USB 3 port
jumping around here a little bit at the
top of the screen you have a 720p webcam
on the wrist rest you have two speakers
two channel speakers and then on the
keyboard on the arrow keys up and down
if you hold the function key and press
those you will either overclock or
underclock your graphics cards down
arrow pulls the clock speed down up
arrow pulls the clock speed up in terms
of cooling it features two fans in the
top left and top right hand corner of
the laptop they both pull air in from
the top and the bottom of the laptop
simultaneously and then eject the hot
air right out the back and then on the
bottom of the laptop there's a layer of
foam which seems weird at first and it's
really bad at transferring heat but that
is the point and that's what makes it
good it's trying to not transfer heat
down to your legs when you use the
laptop on your well lap hence the name
and that's nice because then it can just
focus on getting all the hot air out the
back which is not on your lap which is
not in the name the foam mat would
prohibit them from allowing little small
access panels to all the different
things that you can change in a laptop
like this but they've just made it so
the entire bottom panel comes off at
once and that makes it so you can access
your two-and-a-half inch rise your end
about to drive your RAM all that kind of
stuff it's all accessible down there
which is great the SD 15 might not weigh
as much or have as many screens or have
as big of keys as certain other laptops
that we've seen at the show so far but
it's like actually reasonable and makes
sense so I mean that's genuinely cool
let me know what you guys think in the
comments down below as for us thanks for
dbrand for sending us here to CES 2017
they have skins that are like pretty
cool like they look better than stuff
like this they look like that or like
this which is great this is a new Marvel
skin which like everyone at the laptop
tried to get everyone at the laptop and
we're not the company tried to get on
their laptops that we got for Christmas
which was pretty cool I got a purple one
because I named all my computers after
Pokemon and I'm gonna make it Haunter
but you know there's that also if you
buy one that isn't this thing you can
get $1 shipping anywhere in the world I
want you to challenge that try to find
somewhere where they won't ship it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
