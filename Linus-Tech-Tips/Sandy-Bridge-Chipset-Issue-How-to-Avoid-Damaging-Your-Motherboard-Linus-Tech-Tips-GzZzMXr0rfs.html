been lots of hubbub all over the
Internet's about this but Intel's Sandy
Bridge chipsets that is the P 67 and H
67 chipsets are affected by a bit of an
issue that can cause the SATA to three
gigabit per second ports on your
motherboard to degrade slowly over time
and then die okay
so basically right now if you look
around on the major retail sites you
probably can't buy a Sandy Bridge board
looks like it's probably gonna be around
the April May time frame before you can
actually buy a Sandy Bridge board but
I'm going to show you guys if you
already have a system based on P 67 or H
67 chipsets how you can prevent this
issue from affecting you in the near
term while you wait for the replacement
boards to come on the market and for
yours to be swapped for one okay so you
can see right here the way I have my
Sandy Bridge system set up is that I
have my two SATA 2 devices that is my
DVD burner as well as my Intel X 25 M
SSD plugged into these two ports so you
can see right here that these are SATA 3
g5 SATA 3 g6 SATA 3 g3 and SATA 3 g4 so
what I'm going to do and you're going to
need to consult the manual of your
particular motherboard find the section
about the internal i/o connectors and
which ones are which in this case they
are labeled on the board and you are
gonna want to take those ports unplug
them from any devices and plug them into
one of the SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports on your board so in this case
these two are running off the Intel
chipset and those are still okay even
though they're running off the same
chipset as the SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second ports and I could also plug them
in to these ones which are running off
of a third-party chipset so any one of
these 4 ports is fine to run my devices
off of in the meantime now bear in mind
that Intel recommends our Intel advises
that the SATA 2
gigabit per second ports are more likely
to die from heavy use
so by avoiding using those ports or
let's say for example you have a three
drive configuration you have an SSD a
hard drive and you have an optical drive
and you only have to say that three six
gigabit per second ports well Intel
recommends you lightly use the SATA 2
ports if you have to so you take your
SSD in your hard drive and you plug them
into these ones so you don't get any
data corruption or potentially even data
loss by using the good save a three six
gigabit per second ports and then you
take your optical drive which unless
you're burning a DVD which probably is a
very low risk sort of thing if something
goes wrong so you take any sort of
non-critical devices and plug those into
the SATA to three gigabit per second
ports so thank you for checking out my
