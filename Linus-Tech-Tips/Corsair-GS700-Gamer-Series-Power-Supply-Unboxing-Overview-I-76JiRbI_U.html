for more details now my theory is that
Corsair is calling this the 2013 edition
because they weren't planning to make
any more power supplies because the
world was going to end in 2012 so they
had to kind of scramble and figure out
what they were gonna do when 2013 rolled
around and all of a sudden they had to
release new products because it did the
world didn't end and in fact is still
very much here that's not actually what
I think happened
but it's pretty funny so anyway this is
the gamer Series GS 700 2013 edition
Corsairs gamer series is mostly
differentiated from the other products
by the fact that it is more modding
friendly so you can see that a lot of
the messaging on the front of it is
actually to do with there you go you can
get a nice shot of that blue LED that's
inside the fan there and you've also got
bentonite Penta nice shots of the
different colors that you can set for it
as well so you can easily illuminate the
fan in red white or blue which should be
perfect for our for US customers UK
customers Canadian customers who else
has a red and white and/or blue flag
those of you who have red white blue or
any combination thereof legs feel free
to chime in in the comments and let us
know what you think of course they're
really taking care of your sort of
national pride that you have about your
power supply this particular one comes
with a corsair three year guarantee so
it doesn't have that same premium
warranty coverage does something like an
ax series power supply does but it's
more of like a more of a standard
warranty so they're using an
environmentally friendly package there's
your warranty guide as well as some
important safety information we've got
an included power cable that feels
reasonably beefy it's always nice to
have that you know that reassurance of
quality oh this is kind of cool if
you're ever trying to put your plug
through a wall which I've done with
these before then you
appreciate that this is the first time
I've ever really seen one that's like a
low-profile power supply connector that
you're able to that doesn't have like a
bulky square piece behind that okay
anyway no one really cares about that
I'm sorry zip ties as well as screws are
included from anything eating your cakes
there's that environmentally friendly
carton that I was talking about before
so this is a non module just like
smacked the camera with the with the
power supply packaging there so it's a
non modular power supply making it not
really suitable for the most
aesthetically pleasing builds on the
less you use a case that has excellent
cable management options on conveniently
many of course there's cases have
excellent cable management options so
you don't have to worry too much about
that it also means that you're going to
have to have this sort of rat's nest to
deal with and tuck away somewhere but
like I said as long as your case has
that then you shouldn't worry about it
too much in terms of included connectors
you've got a 24-pin connector here
you've got what the devil is this okay
this is the back of a SATA connector
I'll find that at some point here and
then I'll get that get that fixed the
cables leaving on this particular unit
isn't really anything that special it's
more of a value oriented power supply so
there's a single four plus four or eight
pin connector so you won't be plugging
any sort of you know dual socket
motherboards into it but I don't think
you were expecting to do that if you're
buying a gamer series power supply
you've got two PCI Express six plus two
pin connectors so these guys right here
are able to be plugged into either a six
pin or an eight pin on a graphics card
making this power supply natively
compatible with pretty much a single
graphics card configuration in terms of
SATA connectors you've got him two
harnesses each of which has four
connectors on it they're nice and
closely spaced together this is
something that I actually really like to
see so many power supply manufacturers
will have them spaced kind of like one
here and one here and then you've got
all this extra cable that you don't
really know what to do with because
generally speaking in most cases your
drives are either really far apart where
you've got a five and a quarter inch
and then like a three and a half inch
drive somewhere else entirely or they're
really close together so it's nice to
see that that little piece that fell off
goes on the back of one of these
connectors somewhere or doesn't maybe
it's just an extra one that they snuck
into the box see I thought it was I
thought it was one of these that goes on
the back here you can see it is one of
those but it looks like it's just a
random extra one it's a bonus oh wait
there's more Corsair added extra value
with this extra connector that doesn't
do anything um
this random I guess so two three pin
molex plus floppy harnesses and
relatively short cables on these ones
but generally speaking I don't find
myself routing molex connectors very far
away from the power supply anymore
anyway so here we find that single 140
millimeter cooling fan here on the
bottom that has a hot that three-way
illumination switch right there we're
going to turn this on so we'll be back
in just a moment so for those of you who
don't know this is how to jump for a
power supply you take the green pin
connect it to any of the black pins flip
the switch and she's on so that's the
blue version now I wish Corsair included
the other colors that you can because
you can see right here that they've
clearly planned much like their
Dominator Platinum's with the changeable
light bar module for you to be able to
change that color there so maybe there's
like a kid or something I don't know but
anyway let's go ahead and press that
lighting button on the back so it's
right there oh yeah
white red off that's nice it's nice to
have the off option so blue right red
and off just like that now you can see
the fans not spinning it's nice to see
Corsair include those kinds of premium
features even in their more value
oriented options such as the having the
fan not spin up unless the power supply
is under some kind of a significant load
now it also uses again so sort of more
premium features that you wouldn't
necessarily expect on a value power
supply it has a single 12 volt rail so
that's capable of providing up to 696
watts which is almost the entire power
delivery that the entire power supply is
capable of it is also rated at temperate
of up to 40 degrees and I don't think I
ever even mentioned the 80 plus
certification so this power supply is 80
plus bronze certified which is about
what you'd expect again what's sort of a
value oriented but still good quality
power supply that you would buy these
days so why did I bother getting my
hands on this power supply because
usually I take a look sort of at the
high-end glamour products on this
particular channel the reason is that
we'll be doing a build guide and when I
was shopping around for a power supply
that would be appropriate for sort of if
you're gonna go sort of good better best
for like a better class machine this one
really fit the bill it has the
connectors I need it has the power
output that I need it has good looks it
has that customizability and it's from
coarser oh I inherently figure it
couldn't be that bad don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
I'm sure course they are super thrilled
with me saying it couldn't be that bad
about their product but hey it's not a
bad thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
