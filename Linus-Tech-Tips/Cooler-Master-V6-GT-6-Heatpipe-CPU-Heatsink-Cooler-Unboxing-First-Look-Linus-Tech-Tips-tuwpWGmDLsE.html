cooling 200 plus wat cooling solution
from coolermaster this is an upgrade to
their v6 cooler obviously and it has
muscle unlike me okay so it is
compatible with intel LGA 1366 1156 and
775 it's also compatible with AMD am3 am
too and am too plus so it's compatible
with pretty much every modern socket out
there right now and by pretty much I do
mean all you can see through there's
like a engine looking thing and they've
got a picture of the cooler and you can
see the cooler itself let's have a quick
look at what they have to say about it
on the packaging outside so far not a
whole lot ah here it is ok so it is
highly dense and tilted aluminum fins so
you can expect this to perform best with
a high static pressure pin I'm actually
just going to open it and then sort of
talk about it while we're looking at the
product rather than talk about it while
we're looking at the box this looks cool
actually here it is the v6 GT apparently
perfect for case modder so I was half
expecting this to be like a fan speed
controller but it's not that's a good
idea actually I should suggest that to
somebody ok so on either side we've got
cooler master's uh oh these are cool so
this is one of their new series of fans
it has kind of a wave shape to the fins
which apparently gives you better
performance ok so that's great it
includes their their latest fans you
flip it over so you can see that the
fins are indeed quite densely packed and
it does feature six discreet heat pipes
now these are relatively ok no that's ok
never mind as soon as I move this that
fan will spin there we go so it features
six discreet heat pipes now they're not
the thick heat pipes but there are so
many of them i can't imagine that it
matters all of that much so i'm just
going to go ahead and sort of push all
of the all the cables and stuff out of
here so that i can get access to them
and show you exactly how to hook it up
so it is a push-pull heatsink that means
that the two fans one is pushing air
into the heatsink the other one is
pulling air through so when you've got a
den
Finn arrangement that is the best way to
set it up because push-pull doesn't
actually increase the the CFM the
airflow but what it does do is it
increases the the pressure so it makes
it so that it will slow down the air
less to have these fins in the way so
we've got one adapter that basically
takes a pwm fan header on your
motherboard preferably your CPU one and
then turns it into to PWM fans headers
for the cooler itself so it's sleeved so
you could kind of like tuck this one
under the heatsink like that and then
have it just come out with the the
sleeve bit and plug that right into your
motherboard so it should look quite tidy
then you've also got a molex plug here
and I'm I don't have a loss for for what
thou before maybe we'll go find out
after okay let's have a look at what
we've got in terms of installation
instructions and accessories so we've
got a user's manual okay that's quite
small then we have a warranty card also
quite small and then we have a less
small user's manual okay that's in a
bunch of different languages and it
gives you a little picture guide of how
to install on all the different sockets
including oh this is good you can
actually install the am to a m3 in
either direction so you're not married
to one way or the other because remember
the a.m three mounting equipment is not
square so let's go ahead and sort of see
if we can get these fans off actually
let me do that first I don't know if I'm
going to be able to do that especially
on camera that seems like it might be
quite challenging maybe it's just a
matter of pulling it out this way no
that's not it okay maybe it's a matter
of pressing this button know that button
does something though and we're going to
find out what it does before this
video's through maybe that's what you're
waiting for maybe that's why you're
still watching the video so you can find
out what exactly that button does I
suspect it's something to do with lights
I'll say that much okay
apparently it is not really designed to
be easily taken apart although I suspect
there is a way to take it apart and it's
not all that difficult but I'm just
having trouble so why don't we do our
obligatory finger shot thing here to see
the shininess of the base because
everyone likes that if you don't like
that feel free to leave a comment and
tell me you don't care okay oh you can
tell right away that this is uh this is
actually a a convex base so that's
designed to get better mounting pressure
against the cpu there you go you can see
that ok now let's go over into my office
where I have a power supply plugged in
to the space under my desk just follow
me so my office is two doors down from
the cameraman which you probably don't
already know unless you're a super
creeper okay so I'm just gonna plug this
power supply in assuming I can find a
power plug to plug it in with ya it's
funny cuz I thought I had one ah here we
go okay so we'll plug in this power
supply this is my random fan testing
power supply it is jumper Don and I'm
gonna go ahead and plug this in and
we'll find out what it does ok so far
nothing now we're gonna press the button
Oh check it out it's red so there's a
red LED light strip that goes down the
top of the v6 GT cooler or blue oh I
like it purple or nothing red blue
purple or nothing I personally would
choose this one because I think that
looks sweet and you know what I wouldn't
I wouldn't be all that surprised at this
point if the fans are led to but okay
here just turn the camera off for a
second so I couldn't find an adapter so
i had to find a computer that's on so
we're going to go ahead and plug in the
4-pin pwm fan header that splits out
into two and we're going to plug that in
here now this fan is running Linux
so it is under full 100% load so that's
going to be the maximum fan speed but it
pushes quite a bit of air and what's
interesting actually is that compared to
standing or sitting or kneeling whatever
be right in front of it like this if you
turn it to the side you actually hear it
a lot less so that's a pretty good thing
about the Shroud I guess here why don't
I go ahead and plug this in for the full
effect there we go so this is what it
would look like if you installed it in
the computer which maybe I'll do later
purple yeah okay so there that's my
video on the v6 GT from coolermaster
thank you for checking it out and don't
forget to it's upside down don't forget
