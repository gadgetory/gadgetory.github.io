IT administrator a computer enthusiast
or just a regular old gamer there's
probably been a time when you've needed
to do something remotely on one of your
systems and you're not in a place where
it's very convenient whether it's power
cycling updating your software or just
troubleshooting a program but if you're
like me services like TeamViewer never
fully scratch that itch due to limited
functionality or the dreaded commercial
use suspected shutting you down
thankfully for us the guys over at pulse
way offered to sponsor a video
showcasing their management software and
we thought it'd be a great fit for you
guys so let's check it out shall we
here on the roof of our building because
why not
so Pulse way is what's known as an AR mm
or remote monitoring and management
software which sounds really really
really boring but there's more here than
meets the eye
so the main idea behind pulse way is
simple but powerful computer match off
crap that still sounds boring doesn't it
okay no wait so once you've installed
the pulse way software on your system
systems or like your entire office base
although we recommend using their
deployment tool for that last one you'll
be in full control of those devices
using Bare control interfaces and you
can do it remotely so we're gonna start
with the web version and save the best
the pulse way app for later once you've
logged in right away you're going to be
greeted by a list of the systems that
you set up earlier in our case we
installed it on a couple for demo
purposes here first is our
patent-pending Google Recker followed by
our steam caching server
Jake's workstation and then of course
our main production storage server Wanek
because who doesn't test software on
their most mission-critical machine yeah
well it's your idea clicking on any one
of them is gonna reveal a ton of
monitoring goodness so by default
there's actually quite a few unique
controls and monitoring like what we'll
call them tabs that you can play with so
here we can see CPU usage ran the
temperature of the individual cores of
our processor what motherboard is
running and even what BIOS version that
the system is running so you'll know
which units like let's say you've got a
whole deployment of a bunch of systems
you can tell which ones need updating
against security vulnerabilities like
Spectre for example you can also view
the total and remaining space on your
drives view and kill specific processors
like say if they're pegging the CPU at a
hundred percent rendering it unusable
and you can even send a test print page
from that system to see if the printer
is actually broken or if it's just yet
another ticket from like that one dude
in accounting who doesn't know the
difference between printing to a printer
and printing to a PDF this is there's no
option export to PDF
there's not an option to do it on here
oh did I mention that you can view
execute and schedule updates with it
even down to specific types and that's
all before you even go into the features
that aren't enabled by default so with
network monitoring we can see who's
using up all the bandwidth torrenting at
work and with the notification system
this is really cool we can go through
the literally twelve tabs of different
notification options that can be
customized on a system by system basis
so that for example you'll be notified
as soon as your server room sets on fire
and not when Colton shuts off his PC
after getting fired for the 380 third
time but you've probably noticed by now
that at least a couple of the machines
that were showing off here aren't
running Windows compatibility is another
really strong point for pulse way
they've got clients for most Linux
distros raspbian mac and windows and the
software has a full fat rest api so you
can actually code monitoring and
management functionality into the
services and applications that your own
company develops then you can control
those with the regular pulse way web
interface back to more regular users
though pulse way also has this really
cool automation tab so basically what it
includes is a bunch of sample scripts
that should complement any power shell
or bash scripts that you import and that
can easily be scheduled like checking
for and installing any critical updates
outside of work hours ensuring that you
never have to look at another Windows
Update or using it as an easy way to run
that screen melting executable that
you've been cooking up in Visual Studio
to prank your co-workers and all of this
can be done on their app for iOS and
Android as well it is basically a
complete copy of the web interface
except in mobile form so you aren't
sacrificing any functionality when
you're on the go for example you could
turn on your plex server via wake-on-lan
download your favorite show and
basically prepare yourself for a flight
without ever thinking about breaking out
your lap
which admittedly probably isn't a very
common use case but I think you guys get
the point it's very very versatile so
thanks to pulse wave for sponsoring this
showcase of their rmm software let us
know down in the comments if you have
any cool ideas for how you or we could
use pulse wave
maybe it's finally time to set up
monitoring on all the servers so yeah so
stay tuned for the next server room
update because yeah we should definitely
do that so thanks for watching guys if
you dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join let us know in the comments if you
want to see a tour of our roof we
actually were counting and we have
almost as many rooftop cooling systems
as the entire rest of our building and
the two other buildings in our complex
combined because we're ridiculous like
that we just care about our employees
comfort Brandon's comfort in particular
and Tyler they got they have the highest
HVAC investment per per person or person
in the company yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
