was supposed to be a PSA about the
dangers of using fast charging and
wireless charging and we had this whole
plan worked out where we were gonna use
a thermal camera to measure how hot our
devices were getting discussed the
detrimental effects of heat on phone
batteries complain that they're not user
replaceable etc etc but as it turns out
if you're using a modern charger like
these ones from Ankur that they
unwittingly sent over for us to crucify
it's basically a non-issue but don't
stop watching yet because you're
non-replaceable phone battery is still
at risk of a premature death and
strategically applied wireless or fast
charging could actually help prevent
that death and I'm gonna tell you how as
long as you've got enough juice to make
it through this really long segue to
today's video sponsor private Internet
access are you looking for an affordable
and reliable VPN p.i a encrypts your
Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP check it out today through
the link below
growing up I was always taught that when
my rechargeable discman and game gear
batteries died I should charge them all
the way and then discharge them all the
way because if I didn't they might not
last as long the next time because they
would remember the lower capacity so
fast forward you know I forget how many
years it is fast forward to today and
generally speaking I charge my phone
with the same mentality leaving it
plugged in overnight so that I have a
hundred percent when I start my day and
then only plugging it again when it is
almost dead that evening but here's the
problem as your phone charges its
batteries acceptance of ions actually
becomes more and more labored as the
battery gets close to a full charge kind
of like how packing in passengers is
easy at the start but as a car gets more
and more full it takes a lot of pressure
to get the last couple of people in and
it's a slow process so in the world of
electricity voltage is a lot like
pressure and the last five percent
charge from 95 to a hundred takes
significantly more of it but with very
little current actually flowing in
that's why it's so slow and it's not by
choice if you go too fast towards the
end you'll end up with a unwanted gases
that can cause the battery to swell and
be an effect called polarization that
makes your phone think that the battery
is full when it's not well okay so I'm
asleep the phone's fully charged
well everyone knows that it can't
overcharge what's the big deal
going back to our car analogy sitting at
a hundred percent capacity is really
uncomfortable for your battery and well
everyone so if you want your battery to
stay healthy for years and years you
should only allow it to charge - it's
less stressful voltage about three point
nine volts which means stopping charging
once your phone reaches
60 to 65% which isn't nearly enough for
me to get through a whole day so this is
where fast charging and the wireless
chargers that we mentioned before
come in this might seem counterintuitive
because fast charging works by forcing
in a ton of electrons at high voltages I
mean we're talking fourteen and a half
volts on the iPhone 10 when the battery
is near empty but that is why fast
charging is only activated while your
battery is under 50 or 70 percent that's
while it is still accepting ions very
readily rather than turning them into
wasted heat so what do you do if you're
the type of person who needs as much
screen time as possible each day and you
plan on upgrading every one or two years
anyway then charge it overnight
you'll be reducing your battery's health
but I guess that's whoever buys it on
eBay problem
however if you're the type of person who
wants their phone to last three four or
even five years then you want to charge
your battery in a way that preserves its
health and this is where it gets tricky
because even the act of discharging your
battery ages it according to the depth
of discharge therefore if you really
want to optimize its longevity
you should only let it drain down to say
50% before charging it up to just 60% a
depth of discharge of only 10% now that
sounds like a gigantic hassle but lots
of people do try to stay between 25 and
80% and fast wireless chargers like the
ones we were planning to tell you not to
use are actually really helpful for that
you just set your phone down on the pad
whenever you're at your desk and let
your battery graze rather than gorge and
that's without the inconvenience of
messing with a power cable just make
sure that you put your phone down
correctly so I like this design in
particular because it's actively cooled
for faster power delivery and it forces
you to line up the phone correctly for
maximum efficiency less wasted electrics
means less heat which is better for your
battery just don't leave it on the pad
for too long because as of right now
only Android phones and only rooted ones
in particular support apps that let you
avoid the discomfort of a 100% charge
speaking of discomfort it can be a
pretty uncomfortable feeling when you
drop your phone and break your screen
and that's where I fix it comes in they
are leading the charge in the
electronics repair industry with both
their guides on their website and their
tools including their iconic black and
blue Pro tech toolkit and it's now only
60 bucks it stores on a nice compact
little roll it comes with their 64 bit
driver kit a wide variety of plastic
opening tools sputters and pick so you
can safely poke and pry a suction cup
with a fancy handle to remove display
assemblies their own Jimmy pry tool ESD
safe tweezers and more and it's all
backed by I fix its lifetime warranty so
why pay someone else to fix your devices
when you can check out their free repair
resources over at ifixit.com and go to
ifixit.com slash Linus to snag your own
fully loaded pro tech tool kit again
it's now only 60 bucks so thanks for
