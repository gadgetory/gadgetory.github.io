store there's actually construction
going on in the background so I
apologize if you can't hear me that well
but we've got another Samsung TV to
unbox here this is their Smart TV 8000
class LED backlit LCD TV this is a
60-inch TV this is going to be the
centerpiece of this new Samsung showcase
store so it's actually going to go right
there as you walk in the door it'll be
the first thing you see and that is for
a very good reason it's not all of the
most advanced features the Samsung
offers including their 960 clear motion
rate which is sort of a combination
between the refresh rate of the panel
which is still 120 Hertz and then the
way that they process the image and
modulate the backlight in order to
achieve Samsung is taking as a perceived
960 images per second motions great it's
a smart TV with full support for 3d does
a much bigger piece of styrofoam than I
thought it was with full support for 3d
as well as all of their Smart TV
features including all share which
allows you to easily share content and
media from mobile devices such as your
tablet or your smart phone as long as
they are part of the Samsung ecosystem
here we've got the mount adapter which
we're gonna have a look closer look at
in a minute when we actually mount the
TV but in terms of the other specs it's
not an ultra clear panel spot mega
contrast ratio micro dimming which
actually someone bought one of these TVs
in our Vancouver store the other day and
it was because he was looking for the
micro dimming feature which Samsung says
without halo effect allows you to
achieve deeper blacks and brighter
whites and
the details without I mean I've seen
yeah I've seen TVs with localized
dimming in fact my TV has localized
dimming but honestly it's not that great
because it takes a very substantial
chunk of the panel and brightens it or
dims it which because I'm using mine as
an HTP see is very disruptive to my
entertainment experience because as soon
as I go to my desktop which is black the
whole TV goes and then as soon as I open
up content it's like ooh oh I guess we
brighter so it's kind of frustrating
that way but they're micro dimming
feature says that they can do that in
much smaller areas which means it'll be
less disruptive here's the base which
you can see is an almost seamless piece
of metal so there's a little plastic
piece here that forms the bottom and
then the top is one piece on this side
which has a little theme here and then
one piece on the other side which has a
little sort of theme right there so
we're gonna go ahead and put this I
don't know which way the TV goes on here
but I'm gonna assume the rounded part is
in the back I'm gonna put this down here
and then let's see if I can actually
even reach the accessories here so in
terms of accessories we've got the
documentation which includes all your
warranty and all that info on the one
side all right we're gonna have to pull
out the TV first to find the accessories
so give me a minute here I gotta get a
cameraman to help me with this I don't
want to lay the panel down or anything
like that so give me a second okay so
the abstract of the accessories here
guys and we've got a number of things
we've got a power kit oh wow check that
out I don't even see a power brick so
that means in this slim design TV they
actually integrated the powder hot
converter that's outstanding actually
okay we've also got composite input
adapter a component input adapter so if
you're using any legacy devices that
require an analog signal to go up to
your highly advanced TV then you know
you can do that these are for the base
amount to provide a little bit of
structural rigidity and then that looks
like a cable management thing with some
adhesive on the back and here is the far
cooler part so we've got the included
four triple-a batteries that you're
going to need for this and this is
samsung's Smart TV compatible full
quirky
remote control so check this out so the
thickness is actually fairly thick okay
it's quite substantial but there's a lot
of electronics in here so I kind of
understand that so on this side you see
all your standard volume up volume down
Smart Hub menu blah blah blah and then
the other side Oh BAM
for use pairing with TVs needed love
okay and then there's instructions for
pairing which oh really oh no it's okay
it's okay because there's a plastic
there's a plastic piece here that comes
off okay so there's a little screen here
so you can see what you're typing and
then we've really disappointed I was
like really how come they made such a
major oversight so here is a full QWERTY
keypad number pad as well as navigation
buttons you can change your input so you
can actually choose which side of the
remote you want to use and look at that
special characters and everything so
this is going to be great if you want to
browse the web on your TV or you know
search for YouTube videos or type
anything on your TV it'll be good to
have a keypad pretty self-explanatory I
think but it's neat that they included
that's not actually the only thing that
Samsung includes with this 8000 series
TV you're really unveiling okay so this
is the sort of the pitch for this TV
check this up
Samsung calls this their a one design
bezel I had no idea what they mean by
one maybe they mean one centimeter that
looks like about a centimeter but it's
possible that's not what they mean at
all but basically this is how you're
gonna pull out the old iPhone thickness
comparison this bezel is not much
thicker than an iPhone it's not as thick
as two iPhones it's so thin that
basically when cameraman and I were
pulling it out of the box
we couldn't even figure out where to
grip the TV because normally I would try
to put most of
pressure off of the bezel I even
couldn't even touch it oh yeah I wanted
to talk about the other thing that's a
samsung includes two pairs of their
high-end super lightweight 3d active 3d
shatter glasses with this TV so let's go
ahead and open that up I'll just model
this for you guys okay so it'll look
kind of something like this so I'm not a
good look for me whatever we have these
on demo in the new Vancouver store so
you can you can check them out if you so
desire what's the the selling point of
these guys is is that they're much
lighter weight than existing other 3d
glasses on the market they're they're
actually really really light and they're
and they don't look quite as stupid on
the label
they don't look free either 3d glasses
that's just what we have to live with so
guys give me a sec I'm gonna get this
onto the stand so we can see it in all
of its glory and magnificence well
there's no doubt it's a thing of beauty
I just checked my notes there's a couple
things I did miss so I did miss the
white color enhancer plus feature that
is enabled on this particular TV and
then also the hybrid 3d engine so this
is the processor that's built into this
TV that actually allows you to
dynamically convert on-the-fly
any 2d content into stereoscopic 3d
which is great because it actually works
if you guys checked out my video on
Samsung's by 800 series monitor for your
PC I actually did a video on my NCIX
plumb channel where I talked about that
particular technology is
outstanding so there's no performance
hit to whatever it is that you're
feeding the signal into the TV with so
you don't even more powerful back that's
part or anything like that to play 3d
games others particularly TV because all
of the processing is done on the fly by
your TV so I think that's pretty much it
in terms of general features but yeah
it's pretty nice-looking don't forget
guys if you do want to check another
person you can see this TV at our
Vancouver store on Broadway our new
Vancouver store on Broadway and then you
can also check it out in the new
Aberdeen store that's gonna be right
next to the old Aberdeen store that will
still be there let's check out what it's
got in terms of inputs and outputs and
we're on totally the wrong side of the
TV for that look at this from the back
that's like a reasonably nice finish you
know no plastic or anything like that
that's good okay let's go over into the
other side so we can see what we got in
terms of input its know put some here
you take that angle and I'll stand up
here so we've got one two three USB
ports with this one optimized for hard
drive because remember this is a smart
TV digital audio out optical we've got 4
HDMIs with 1/4 DVI and this one's for
arc okay AV in its right here so that's
your component and then PC so that's
your VGA down there antenna in there's
your composite input with audio out X
link and land so smart TVs they do want
lands so you're gonna want like a
powerline adapter or a wireless bridge
of some sort in order to get a network
connection to this TV so you can take
advantage of all those features you know
your Skype your Twitter your Facebook
etc etc and your full QWERTY remote
control get that into that and I think
that pretty much covers it so thank you

Samsung's 8000 series 60-inch LED
