draw your curtains and lock the door
because in this historic and
groundbreaking build guide we indulge
your every guilty pleasure even your
secret desire to see the old kitchen set
one last time welcome to the twenty five
hundred dollar gaming RGB build guide
it's all RGB all the time deal with it
we'll start as always at our safe clean
static free workstation by whipping out
all the tools we're gonna need a
magnetic multi bit screwdriver and a
parts tray our four screw management a
pair of side cutters and needle nose
pliers our for cable management and
these shoes these are for party
management
okay but getting serious I always
recommend plugging your components in
and powering your system up once outside
of the case to verify that the system
posts or powers on and outputs to a
display you can use your motherboard box
as a free non conductive test bench so
our CPU choice shouldn't surprise anyone
there's nothing RGB about the core i5
7600 K from Intel
but it's great for gaming it's unlocked
for overclocking and it offers more
performance per dollar than any other
Intel chip as we outlined here for
content creators you might want to
switch over to the i7 7700 K and
everything else in this build will still
be hunky-dory so lift the retention arm
like so then holding the CPU by the
edges identify the corner with the gold
triangle align it with the blunted
corner of your socket place it in with
no force give it a little wiggle lower
the cover and fasten the retention arm
again the plastic cover should pop off
all on its own put that somewhere safe
just in case you ever have to RMA your
board there are a few options available
for our GB RAM including Corsairs
Vengeance RGB series and the shield RGB
from new kid on the block
Zadok 511 but for this build we chose a
64 gig kit of Trident z RGB memory from
g.skill unlike the competition each dim
sports 5 individually addressable LEDs
and g.skill built in ASU's are a sync
support so you can configure RGB waves
and animations to your heart's content
through software pull back the tabs on
all four Ram slots then position each
dim so the notch on the bottom lines up
with the notch in the socket and press
firmly until the tab on the end snaps
back into place on its own
rinse and repeat if you're only using 2
dims go ahead and just
use the gray slots so as for the case we
looked at a bunch of options across
different price points and noticed a bit
of a trend the more you pay the more RGB
lights you get so then which case has
the most lights per dollar the answer is
clear you can't have more than infinity
and that's why we chose the in win 805
infinity it sports
tempered glass side panels and the front
uses RGB strips and mirrors to create an
infinity Hall effect that looks even
better in person than it does on camera
and it's RS sync ready to boot now the
front of the 805 infinity is completely
impermeable so for supplementary cooling
we're going to be using a 3-pack of a
hundred and twenty millimeter HD RGB
fans from Corsair pull both tempered
glass side panels off and stash them
using both hands somewhere safe
preferably right back in the box where
they're not going to get knocked over
you'll need to set aside the thumb
screws and the rest of the included
hardware at this point as well after
that install your nine motherboard
standoffs here here here here here here
here and here and then we're gonna swap
out the rear exhaust fan this little
arrow indicates the direction of the
airflow place the fan with the leads
toward the top of the case then you can
turn your attention to the bottom to
remove that drive cage take off the
magnetic air filter pop off the rubber
feet and stand and these screws being
sure of course to stow your drive cages
somewhere safe in case you need to oh I
don't know add an RGB hard drive down
the road when and if they become
available then use the included hardware
with your fans to install the two
remaining RGB fans with their leads
oriented inward towards the motherboard
before finally replacing the case stand
and snapping on the air filter choosing
the motherboard took a bit of shopping
we decided to go with a suit
because we wanted our lighting effects
to be as fully synchronized as possible
and at the time of writing there are
async RGB ecosystem offered the widest
compatibility with third-party products
but that wasn't the end of the journey a
Seuss offers a pretty extensive lineup
of Ã¤ra sync motherboards in the end then
we chose the Maximus 9 hero with its
discreet and neutral black PCB it's got
two included glow zones both the PCH and
the i/o plate are lit two auxiliary RGB
headers to support all the chaos we're
about to unleash and support for nvidia
sli more on that later
one shortcoming of this motherboard
though is that it only has a single USB
2.0 header and our case cooler and RGB
strips are all fighting for that
precious real estate so for an extra 25
bucks we grab this internal USB hub from
NZXT and taped over the white LED to
keep it from harshing our RGB vibes
press firmly then in all four corners of
the i/o shield at the back of the case
until they snap into place then set the
motherboard into place and slide it back
run the cable for the sli bridge behind
the board and plug it into this header
here then use the included screws with
the case to fasten the motherboard to
the nine standoffs now while we have
easy access to the board is a great time
to plug in everything you can plug the
eight pin CPU power connector in to make
cable management slightly less
nightmarish later then you're gonna want
to do the front panel connectors for the
power and reset switches and the power
and drive activity LEDs the front USB 3
and HD audio over here and an RGB strip
way up here we used double-sided
adhesive to mount our internal USB hub
right here then connected it to the
motherboard
using the nine pin USB 2 header here
finally we'll connect power for our
three fans using the headers here here
here we chose a big old 280 millimeter
radiator for this build Corsairs h 110 i
should help balance out the thermal
impediments imposed by the case design
that we referred to earlier but much
more importantly than that it glows in
every color of the rainbow inside the h
110 i box we have two different mounting
back plates this is the one we'll be
using mount the back plate to the back
of the motherboard indentation side up
if the fasteners don't immediately align
with the holes in your motherboard don't
freak out their position on the back
plate can be adjusted fix the back plate
in place using these included standoff
screws then leave this area alone for
now and move over to the radiator cage
where we'll remove the cases radiator
mounting bracket by unscrewing these two
screws setting them aside for a moment
to assemble our cooler we have three
components that we need to fasten it
together using the long screws that came
with it the radiator our recently freed
mounting bracket and our Corsair HD 140
RGB fans which we're going to use
instead of the boring corporate slave
ones that were included a range and
screw together these components such
that the fans are closest to the center
of the case the mounting bracket is
closest to the front of the case and the
radiator is sandwiched in the middle
be sure to orient the fans so that they
pull fresh air in from the front of the
case and blow it towards the motherboard
with the fan leads against the
motherboard tray for optimal cable
management place the completed unit
inside the case the fan leads should be
passed through the side of the case the
radiator should be hidden behind the
front panel and these little legs on the
mounting bracket should nest inside
these receptacles
with everything set fasten the mounting
bracket to the case again using the
screws you set aside before now finally
we can connect the pump and block to the
CPU start by removing the plastic
cover that protects the included thermal
compound then place this mounting
bracket over the block and align it with
the standoffs you installed earlier then
use the included thumb screws to secure
all four corners being careful not to
over crank them plug in the included
mini USB cable then run the pump power
connector and the two fan power cables
over to the rear of the motherboard tray
connect the fan power leads from your HD
140 millimeter fans to those leads
coming off the pump plug the 9-pin USB
connector into the hub and you're good
to go
now our DV power supplies do exist
Thermaltake actually has a whole lineup
of them but if we got one of those
it wouldn't sync with the rest of our
fans and gosh darn it
this is Linus tech tips so what did we
do we voided the warranty of a Corsair
RM 650 X and swapped out the fan for yet
another Corsair HD 140 mil to be clear
this is a really janky solution and we
wouldn't recommend it the fan leads
didn't have the same number of pins the
screw holes didn't line up at all and it
is very easy to get shocked or even
killed if you open up a power supply so
if you want a non thermal take our Gbps
you write your local congressional
representative or ask for Sarah to make
an official one because space is tight
between the power supply interface and
the fans we're going to plug everything
into the PSU while it's still loose and
then mount it once everything's
connected you already ran the eight pin
connector when we cheated a bit on the
last step so now plug in the 24 pin
connector being cognizant of the space
you'll need behind the motherboard tray
for cable management then plug in two
SATA cables and one for pin molex cable
and run them through the cable
management hole here we'll use the molex
to power our USB hub then plug in your
PCI Express connectors and let them hang
out here slide the power supply in grill
side up so it sucks hot air out of the
case and exhausts it from the back where
you'll use four screws to fasten it to
the chassis our drive selection for this
system was a no-brainer because at the
time of planning it there was literally
only one option so when our new friends
at Zadok 511 graciously offered to
provide us with one of their shield RGB
240 gig SSDs which according to a
Seuss's website are compatible with our
asynch though we haven't been able to
get the two talking just yet we said
yeah boy this case has a few options for
two and a half inch drive placement but
we chose to put ours here though I can't
help but imagine how awesome it would
have been to have two of these puppies
in raid over here attach the drive to
the mount using four of these small
screws and then slot them out onto the
chassis plug in one of the SATA power
connectors that you left hanging before
then plug in both ends of your dope a F
sleeved cable mod SATA cable here and
here keeping it in the ASIS family for
our video cards we went with there ROG
Strix gtx 1070 a big card with big disco
appeal but what could be better than
this bad boy crunching numbers and
blastin raise how about two of them
crunching numbers and blast and raise
connected by this totally lit AF RGB SLI
bridge
band I'll be honest this thing right
here is the sole reason that this build
uses SLI I mean how could we not you're
welcome start by taking out these PCI
slot covers then align the first card
carefully with the motherboards PCI
Express 16x slot and the openings on the
back of the case push the card in firmly
until the tab snaps shut then put the
case screws back in lock in that sucker
down repeat these steps
for a second card then plug in the eight
pin PCI Express power connectors that we
plugged into the power supply earlier
and now it's time for the crown jewel
connect the two video cards with the sli
bridge if you put it on backwards you'll
know then this cable that we sneakily
ran under the motherboard before plug
that into the sli bridge that's gonna
power its RGB lighting onto lighting our
three pack of course our HD 120 RGB fans
came with a fan hub which we can use to
coordinate the colors on all six of our
system fans the order matters here
though you have to connect them in the
order that you'd like certain color
effects to be displayed we're going to
attach our fan hub to a lighting node
Pro module which we'll also use to power
it's for included LED strips and then
we'll plug both of those into our second
SATA power cable from before finally
we'll connect the node to our USB hub
and as for a spot to mount both of these
things yeah we'll figure that out after
we clean up our cables a little on to
cable management because both sides of
this case are tempered glass we don't
have the luxury of simply covering up
our mess we made in the back with a
bulging right side panel so we're going
to try to run as many of the cables as
we can around the perimeter tucking them
into the inseam we'll also use black
cable ties to bunch up as much of the
clutter as possible and route it in as
straight lines as we can so while we had
to settle for two separate RGB
ecosystems a Seuss's and Corsairs inside
the case at least everything on top of
the desk
is under one umbrella Corsairs we've got
the K 6510 keyless RGB keyboard the M 65
Pro RGB Mouse atop an mm 800 RGB mouse
pad and finally the RGB Void headphones
which could use a little more
RGB I think but forget about that let's
get all this stuff synched up first
we need to power on the system watch it
spring to life and wipe the tears from
our eyes it's beautiful but also untamed
and chaotic we'll fix that later first
we need an OS to install Windows create
a bootable USB Drive then reboot the
system while mashing f8 immediately to
get into the boot device selection menu
where you'll pick your USB Drive once
the setup process has begun mash next
until you land on the desktop head to
Intel Nvidia courser a seuss and in wind
sites to update your drivers and while
you're over there you might as well
download the latest version of the
various lighting control software's that
you will need yes that does seem like a
lot of them and it is but the good news
is Corsair has announced that they'll be
consolidating queue and link at least
into a single software in the near
future but even with our imperfect
mishmash of different utilities we did
manage to create a few cool themes
remember guys the point of RGB isn't to
blast rainbow unicorn barf into people's
eyes at all times but with that said we
do totally endorse that use case for it
most people like it for the flexibility
so you can rock your favorite teens
colors during the playoffs or get
festive during the holidays so
conclusion time then you know what I
think it's pretty safe to say but now
that our build is done I can't help but
think gee could there ever be
a more beautiful machine than this
probably not so it's time to turn the
lights out and bask in its outrageous
rainbowdash wizardry
