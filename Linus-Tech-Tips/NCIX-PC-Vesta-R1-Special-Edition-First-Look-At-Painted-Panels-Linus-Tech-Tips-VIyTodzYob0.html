we've all been waiting for we're on our
way to the paint shop to pick up the
cases they were delayed by one day so we
haven't seen any results yet and I hope
they look as good as I hope they're
gonna look a few pictures for I'll we're
actually documenting the whole process
Oh Lord of these formulas those are
front drills no I'll be like you or your
monitor social stuff oh we're going to
be selling with other people huh really
yeah special systems in these in these
cases oh ok let's try goes oh no I just
mean I don't want to scratch the very
thing we're going to partially
reassemble them before we go just make
transport lower than usual so okay here
here here let's see those girls wait are
you still shooting video ass oh okay
well not on restart
well we haven't seen the cases yet but
here are the front fan grills solos are
looking nice very very glossy red finish
on them so yeah still more to come these
are lava sauce I don't even know what
I'm supposed to say right now but here's
all of the panel's mp3 in the cases are
here to cover over there but one of the
you can't get you can't get too far away
from even the net side of Mike won't
pick me up so what are the shop workers
is over there so we don't want a video
goes but you can see we bought a very
very glossy finish all the local
on the side panels we've got the front
girls done so soon we're going to be
reassembly these to show you guys the
completed case
all right do you want to do a quick
video
I wasn't sure what to make
so we're returning to the scene of the
crime with our finished cases now
they're not perfect I'll be the first to
say that but I can also tell you that
for a custom finished painted case the
pricing of the vest our one is going to
be very very reasonable and the look of
it is pretty astonishing so here I'm
going to be unveiling we've actually
partially assembled the cases to
transport them back from the shop in the
convenient cloth cover that corsair
provides just for just such scenarios as
this there we go so that is our painted
650d you can see we put the side panel
latches back on now because of the way
we mask the cases you see that there's
actually a line right here where the
masking tape was was applied so the
reason we put the line there because I
know it looks kind of stupid with the
case open the reason we put it there was
so that through this gap right here you
won't be able to see any black running
through ok so let's go ahead and flip
this around and so there is the windowed
side oh yeah the back so the back looks
like this the back ended up actually on
the cases nice and clean where we had
our division between painted and not
painted and then we've got our side
panel and then the the grills at the
front will also be done so that's all of
the parts of the cases that will be read</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
