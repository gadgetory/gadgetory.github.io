surprised to hear how many people ask me
if there's an advantage to running AMD
Radeon cards on an AMD platform versus
running a geforce card on an AMD
platform and I can tell you guys now
before I actually finish running the
benchmarks no there is not you the cpu
performance times started the GPU
performance multiplier you know
factoring any bottlenecking that's
occurring where one of them is not
feeding the other quickly enough that's
pretty much how perform how much
performance you get you know PCI Express
this is you know this is an industry
standard and CPU performance is CPU
performance and GPU performance is GPU
performance however for those of you out
here there who are running AMD based
systems I've decided to do some
bulldozer benchmarks with the GTX 680
versus the Radeon HD 7970 so what I want
to achieve in all of this is to give the
AMD guys a good idea of how these two
cards will perform now I am see I don't
know what to tell you guys about the CPU
this is an FX 80 140 which is some like
weird CPU that doesn't seem to be
existing anywhere and I don't know if
it's ever even gonna be released but
what I've done is I've it at 4
gigahertz so that should be fairly
equivalent to something like an 80 150
in terms of performance in most games 4
gigahertz is an easy overclock so just
bear that in mind we're gonna be
comparing this AMD 8 core at 4 gigahertz
to my stock speed 3930k platform and
then we're also gonna be comparing this
CPU performance with the 7970 to the
CPUs performance with the gtx 680 so
just bear that in mind and all of my
results and stay tuned here guys just so
you guys know if you didn't watch my
regular performance review with my 3930k
platform on LGA 2011 I am using all
ultra maximum settings other
maxing out the anti-aliasing which I've
got pegged f4x which for me is a pretty
comfortable setting at 1080p I find that
reduces most of the jakey's for me
personally so since I'm the one doing
the video I guess I get to pick things
like that so yeah we're at 1080p we're
at Ultra or high or whatever they want
to call it settings across the board on
all of these games and here I go so now
I'm testing the GTX 680 on this same
platform and be prepared crazy stuffs
gonna happen all right guys well results
are done so I guess you can kind of hang
with me while I while I rearrange the
spreadsheet a little bit so I'm just
gonna hide some of the less relevant
rows and we're just gonna stay focused
on bulldozer 680 versus 7970 and then
we're also going to pair all of these
down to just the 680 and the 7970 on the
3930k platform so these are using all of
the same testing methodologies other
than changing the CPU and changing the
RAM so the 3930k has 16 gigs around and
this one has only 8 gigs of ram although
I really can't imagine that'll make a
difference in anything other than power
consumption so the 3930k should be at
somewhat of a disadvantage because it
does have more RAM on board it other
than that I think we're pretty darn near
identical here this is across there 5
formula and never mentioned that before
from Asus and I think that's that's
that's pretty much it so here we go so
idle power is pretty darn close I would
say this is within margin of error for
both of these systems so they're yeah
they're very close that way and once
again I can't say necessarily that my
results are you know I should put like
quotes here yeah it's an fx-8150 because
this is a 95 watt TDP CPU so I don't
know how much of a difference that's
gonna make to things like idle power
consumption so grain of salt guys grain
of salt 3d mark 11 squares are pretty
much not affected this is yeah very very
close but we do see a slight perform
decrease on the AMD platform over here I
see I didn't take temp readings this
time around because this is just card
temperatures I don't really care about
that the second time around for
Battlefield 3 you can see performance is
pretty near identical across the two
platforms so in very graphically
demanding games you can often encounter
scenarios where just because the CPU
slower doesn't mean that it will perform
any differently in that game as long as
you have the the graphical horsepower
another thing to bear in mind is that
battlefield series frostbite engine is
heavily multi-threading aware so the
fact that this is 8 cores versus 6 maybe
making a difference for it hard to say
at this point in time Crysis 2 we see a
fairly significant drop in performance
going from the 3930k to the fx-8150 we
see about 10% and this is consistent on
both the GTX 680 in the 79 70 The
Witcher 2 sees very similar performance
I would consider this to be sort of
pretty close to margin of error here
guys
dirt3 sees a significant performance
drop on both the 680 and the 7970 moving
to the other platform although the 680
takes a bigger hit than the 7970 for
some reason Batman Arkham City is pretty
darn close especially on the 680 and
takes a bit of a hit on the 7970 finally
Skyrim just falls off a cliff with the
bulldozer CPU versus using the 3930k so
you can see this is just a disaster
overall power consumption is fairly you
know
well higher on the AMD platform pretty
much across the board so you can see
that it must be somewhere in the CPU or
the motherboard probably the CPU given
that bulldozer is a bit of a power hog
we are using more power than the 3930k
intel 6 cora unlocked processor on the
LGA 2011 platform and I think that
pretty much wraps it up so in conclusion
no there's no real advantage to pairing
this with with this other than that you
get like this wicked like matching color
scheme II thing
with like your red motherboard and
you're ready in the performance edition
RAM and Radeon graphics card I mean
that's cool that's fine and that is a
perfectly legitimate reason if you ask
me to you know buy one component over
another I'm totally shallow like that
but in terms of technical practical
reasons here there is no issue pairing
up a geforce with an AMD chip or Radeon
with an Intel chip thank you for
