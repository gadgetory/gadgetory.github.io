TI which obviously you've seen before
560 TI not a new product by Nature oh
wait hold on a minute let me just get
the plastic off here so that it's not as
glossy and reflective Slick's always
given me a hard time about using
reflective surfaces to reflect light and
make the camera not focus which then he
gets blamed for by the YouTube viewer so
limited edition GTX 560 TI with 448
course so this is significantly more
coarse than a regular 560 TI it also has
more memory than a 560 TI so this is
interesting a 320 bit memory interface
with 1280 Meg's of gddr5 memory that is
starting to look an awful lot like a gtx
570 in terms of the actual spec now gtx
570 is also clocked around this seven
hundred and some-odd so core speed also
clocked around this memory speed so this
is starting to look an awful lot like a
very similar card to a gtx 570 it also
uses a GF 110 core rather similarly to
the gtx 570 so we've got a ZOTAC sticker
ZOTAC graphics card drivers we have some
ZOTAC GeForce accelerated software that
you can get some deals on downloading we
have a ZOTAC extended warranty and quick
installation guide so please register
for your extended warranty on ZOTAC comm
okay I think this one has 2 years if you
register for the extended warranty cool
Oh
five-year warranty really wow that's
awesome it doesn't really have a 5-year
warranty hold on let's find this
information together it'll be a voyage
of discovery uh-huh nothing on the back
three times the performance of previous
generation crank up the gaming realism
okay what do we got here in video 3d
vision blah blah blah okay yeah this is
all good stuff it also supports
you know what we'll get to that when we
get inside huh interesting
okay you know what here let's look at
this again so United States Canada Latin
America
oh they very please refer to your
regional ZOTAC website for details
because yeah I'm pretty sure this one's
too here well go correct me if I'm wrong
here guys we've got a user's manual
we've got a couple accessories is a very
small lock so don't expect you know a
huge Carter too many accessories we've
got a DVI to VGA adapter and a couple
molex to PCIe power adapters and then
though tax cards are always so sleek
looking I love the way their cards look
and this one is no exception we've got a
great little orange mesh and black
shroud theme thing going on here we have
a center mounted fan so this is
something we're pretty used to seeing on
gtx 560 tea eyes but i'm gonna show you
a few things that we are not used to
seeing on gtx 560 TI so first we've
started on the top here we've got our
standard PCI Express 16x power slot RF
power slot PCI Express slot we've got a
matte black PCB which I was not aware of
until now we've got oh that looks so
good
look at this all black components with
just a few different look I like white
or silver accents on a matte black PCB
with orange accents on the front oh yeah
chrome ZOTAC logo this thing is gonna
look so good so good in your system and
check this out you've also got yes
support for 3-way SLI so that is
something we are definitely not
accustomed to seeing on a GTX 560 Ti so
what is this thing basically as far as I
can tell it is pretty much a gtx 570 in
gtx 560 TI clothing although I haven't
benchmarked the card yet this is my
unboxing I'm opening it now but what I'm
gonna do is either on this channel or on
my NCIX comm channel I'm going to spend
a little bit of time and I'm going to
benchmark it and at least a couple games
against the GTX 570 to find out how the
two compare
terms of performance the price is pretty
similar so I expecting them to be fairly
similar in terms of performance in terms
of cooling we've got three heat pipes
down there can you see that okay from
that angle yeah you got that so three
heat pipes coming out and kind of a
flower a flower cooling arrangement you
can actually see the top heat pipe here
which is making contact with large
heatsink fins and you can see in from
this side what they look like on the
back we've also got nice big a nice big
heat sink on the vrm as well as our two
6-pin PCI II power adapt connectors and
then on the top we've pretty much shown
you guys that already what do we got for
i/o we have two DVI ports HDMI and
DisplayPort so ZOTAC has opted to give
you lots of options not just the usual
500 series DVI DVI mini HDMI note we've
got a full size HDMI as well as a
DisplayPort output on this ZOTAC card so
based on the overall cooler design the
PCB design I'm expecting this to be a
fairly quiet card just because most of
the 500 series cards are quite quiet but
until I actually get it on the bench I
won't have a totally clear idea but I
think that pretty much covers it so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the limited edition ZOTAC GTX 560 TI
448 core and stay tuned don't forget to
be subscribed to both Linus tech tips as
well as NCI XCOM for my follow up video
on this where I compare it to the 570
and find out just exactly what this
thing is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
