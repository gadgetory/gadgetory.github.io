be having a look at a system that I put
together for our friends at Corsair they
are actually doing a lot of messaging
around the Corsair dream PC these days
and what that means is that you can buy
brand-name components and build your own
brand name PC so to speak so what
they're saying sometimes to do it right
you have to do it yourself basically
they're encouraging users to load up on
all the Corsair parts that they can
because what that means is that you're
going to have good warranty support good
quality parts and generally a good
functioning system so let's have a look
at what we use for our Corsair dream PC
first of all I've got the Intel Core i7
975 as well as the Intel extreme series
smack over motherboard so that is an
excellent base for any dream PC next we
have Windows 7 home premium which comes
with DirectX 11 it's got Aero snap which
I was actually confused on my my windows
7 preview Aero snap means that you or
Aero shake sorry means that you shake it
and then all the other windows go away
or come back sometimes there we go and
then Aero snap is where you drag it to
the side or to the other side or to the
top there so now I'm no longer confused
about what all the different Aero things
are with Windows 7 anyway we've got the
x11 trim support and windows 7 that's
good stuff then cooling we have the
course our age 50 so this is their fully
integrated liquid cooling system and I'm
going to show you the real parts in just
a second so not going to focus too much
on the boxes we have a Corsair
solid-state drive also included with the
system but the memory box was kind of
ugly but there's some memory so we're
not going to really show too much of
that and then we have the Corsair power
supply now something I want you to
notice about this box is it says it's
got a 5 year warranty that's one of the
reasons that Corsair is encouraging
users to stick with Corsair and to go
with good brand name components for
their own dream BC because even though
you're not buying this dream PC from a
builder you are buying all components
that have good aftermarket support so
you pick up some Radeon cards from XFX
you got lifetime warranty on those you
pick up memory from Corsair you got
lifetime warranty on that five-year
warranty on a Corsair power supply
you've got a 3-year warranty on an Intel
mother
so I mean basically you're getting an
extended warranty package three two
lifetime years and you don't actually
have to buy a pre-integrated PC now
let's get this thing open here first of
all and there we go so I'm just going to
show off what we've got in the dream PC
here so here's our corsair triple
channel six gig memory kit with the
dominator airflow fan here's the corsair
h50 CPU cooler and it's actually running
quite cool I really like this thing
actually and then up here I've got it
kind of creatively mounted here is of
course there are P 128 SSD it's actually
velcroed in there just because I want
people to be able to check that out and
this machine is going to be at tradeshow
so I don't want people ripping them out
of the hot swap drives that are in this
case so that would be a really bad thing
then we've got our 975 processor snack /
motherboard and then down in the bottom
I've got some lighting on it here I bet
the camera is going to go crazy trying
to focus on that but there's our HX 1000
modular power supply and I want you to
check out a couple of cool features
about this case as I mentioned you've
got your hot swap drive base so I'm
gonna get the cameraman to come around
and have a look at the front those are
actually empty on mine and she just
tripped over all the boxes I put on the
ground that's awesome so there's your
hot swap and then in terms of other
really unique features about this case I
guess the biggest one has got to be how
water cooling friendly it is first of
all you can put a triple rad in the top
and a single in the back and see we've
got three 120 millimeter blue LED fans
up there looking pretty sweet and then
the other big one is the cable
management I put like no effort into the
cable management of this PC however it
ends up looking really slick because
you've got all these little rubber
grommet 'add back pieces where you can
route any feasible cable I mean I
managed to mount a hard drive there and
it looks like it belongs there it's
awesome anyway thank you for checking
out my blog video on the Corsair dream
