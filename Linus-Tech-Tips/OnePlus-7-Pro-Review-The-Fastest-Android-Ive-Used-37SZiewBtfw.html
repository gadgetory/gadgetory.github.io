brand on being really fast for one thing
speed is quantifiable so you can't just
say it's magic or it turns you into
professional photographer and then
expect everyone to buy your products
based on their feelings for another
thing it puts such an obvious target on
your back I mean it's not like any of
your competitors are trying to make
their devices slower and that is what
makes one plus's accomplishment here so
impressive the 1 plus 7 pro is hands
down the fastest Android device that I
have ever held in my hand and I'm gonna
show you guys what I mean after this
message from our sponsor Corsair the
corsair iron claw RGB mouse features a
native 18,000 DPI optical sensor a
comfortable palm grip and sub 1
millisecond slipstream wireless
technology check it out at the link
below
let's get the bad stuff out of the way
right now
the 1 plus 7 Pro doesn't have a
headphone jack though in fairness
neither do most flagship phones these
days so harping on that feels like
background noise especially when it also
falls short in some other key areas one
it lacks any wireless charging when
leaders like Huawei and Samsung have
moved on to high-speed wireless charging
and even wireless power sharing 2 it
carries no independently validated water
or dust resistance rating when even
Apple has been doing this for years now
3 it issues other add-ons and features
beloved by Android enthusiasts like
expandable storage IR blasters or
removable batteries and for finally it's
just plain not cheap anymore parent
company BBK Electronics has obviously
set very clear expectations that the
oneplus brand needs to move up market in
order to survive preferring to use
divisions like real me and vivo to
attack budget competitors like wall
weighs honor and shammies poco phone
brands so we follow that out of the way
why do I love this thing so much well it
starts with the feel in the hand oneplus
has taken a huge leap forward with this
generation the 7 pro features curved
Gorilla Glass 5 for both the back and
the screen that's a first for them it's
got ideally positioned lock volume
rocker and do-not-disturb buttons along
with corners that are shaped perfectly
to fit comfortably in a cupped palm in
both portrait and landscape orientations
now it's heavy about the same weight as
a note 9 but with that heft comes a heck
of a lot of phone the display is simply
put outstanding this is one pluses first
1440p class display so folks with
sharper eyes than me will probably
appreciate that but the thing that stood
out to me was the configurability
oneplus holds nothing back here for
example you can switch to DC control to
reduce flicker which is sick and instead
of hiding color profiles behind
ambiguous terms like
photo or vivid they allow the user to
quickly and easily select their color
space of choice and adjust the white
point that's a huge one for me over the
already excellent OLED panel on the
galaxy s 10 plus which is locked into a
warmer white point than I would prefer
in its color accurate profile and it
gets even better
HDR 10 plus certification no not CH no
hole punch no distractions
now purists might still criticize the
heavily rounded corners but I'd say
after about 30 seconds of wide aspect
ratio content on this phone I suspect
most people will completely forget about
it this is the most immersive phone
movie watching experience that I've had
yet and yes some of us watch movies on
our films deal with it the only thing on
my wish list here would be always-on
functionality I've got to praise the
onboard speakers as well LG and huawei
took big Gamble's transitioning to
vibrating screen technology for their
earpiece speakers
and while it paid off in terms of in
call audio quality in my opinion they
both delivered inferior video watching
experiences oneplus opted for a right
side bottom firing speaker and a super
slim amplified earpiece speaker that
between the two of them deliver a very
satisfactory stereo effect even if
they're not the loudest I've ever heard
and they got to get kudos for that now
let's get into my claims about the
oneplus 7 pros incredible speed because
like it sounds kind of hard to believe
right
since flagship phones all have basically
the same hardware in them at this point
the thing is though that tuning matters
it starts with the in screen fingerprint
sensor now I had pretty much accepted
that the convenience of being able to
unlock my phone without flipping it over
came at the cost of slower
authentication not anymore
every device that you're looking at here
has the latest updates the seven pro is
just that much faster and you can
complain that part of Samsung's poor
showing here is that their animation is
slow but the thing is that's part of the
perception of speed like I don't like
everything about oneplus as oxygen OS
the task switcher only shows one task
which i think is dumb and the
fingerprint sensor actually happens to
show up exactly where the clear-all
notifications button is oops
but overall oneplus has worked for years
to purge their OS of unnecessary fluff
in the form of things like lock
animations it doesn't have one the
screen just turns off and folder pop-ups
so snappy so everything just feels fast
and more importantly not just when it's
brand new when I was trying to quantify
my snappy experience with the 7 pro I
grabbed a freshly formatted pixel 3
Excel and I was surprised that given the
pixel threes reputation they were
neck-and-neck in basically everything I
did but then I logged into my Google
account and installed all the same apps
and immediately the difference became
what you're looking at now and the
cherry on top of all of that is the
perceived increase in responsiveness
from the 90 Hertz screen I am a huge
proponent of high refresh rate and the 1
+ 7 Pro is exactly why not only does
every animation look more fluid but
everything on the screen that's in
motion looks higher definition like you
can read text as you're scrolling back
and forth like this actually that brings
us pretty nicely to the camera now
oneplus started out as the foam that was
great except for the camera thank
goodness it's cheap but over the last
couple of generations they've really
broken away from the pack not because
they get the best DXL mark score or
because they have amazing video
recording quality that's still a weak
point from my experience compared to my
note 9 daily driver
what oneplus does well though and the
seven pros 48 megapixel main and
wide-angle shooters are no exception is
take whatever is in front of you and put
it on your screen for better or for
worse their app is super responsive yes
not again and it's simple to use and on
the image processing side they tend not
to overdo anything like edge enhancement
noise reduction or color saturation and
I really like and respect their approach
at least in normal mode their night mode
was actually a bit of a mess for me the
one night that I took it out as for the
selfie camera out of the box it's sharp
accurate and mostly free of weird beauty
processing so pretty good in my book
already but of course that's far from
the coolest thing about it now a motor
pop-up camera is in my mind the riskiest
way to achieve a notch 'less display and
that's because of the moving parts but
oneplus claims that between the gasket
that they've installed to keep out
debris and their automatic retraction
mechanism okay so let's go they
validated it to be used a hundred and
fifty times per day every day for five
years and the thing is I have seen their
R&amp;amp;D and testing center so alright guys
innocent until proven guilty on this one
now as for some of the new camera
selling points I'm a little tepid on
those the three times optical zoom lens
definitely delivers more detail in
faraway objects but at the cost of
inferior processing now it's possible
that this is something they can improve
but it is only an 8 megapixel sensor so
I probably wouldn't hold my breath
I do have more good stuff to say though
30-watt warped charging is some pretty
next-level stuff half of your charge
over this is a four thousand milliamp
hour battery in 30 minutes
dang impressive I'm assuming I don't
know I didn't use it but for good reason
thing is battery life on the 60 was
already great so adding nearly another
10 percent to its capacity could only
serve to improve it and it did now the 7
Pro is still no two-day monster like the
p30 pro but I regularly made it to the
end of the day with 40% in the tank and
I actually got all of my notifications
so that's pretty good which brings us
then to price for the first time second
time actually but who's counting oneplus
is pursuing a two tiered strategy
focusing on the oneplus 7 pro in some
markets and pushing the oneplus 7 a
lower-cost beefed up 60 in others with
this strategy then comes 1 + s biggest
generational price hike yet if you're in
a 7 pro market around $100 so then
over twice as much as the original 1+1
does this still make sense the answer is
yeah
now bargain hunters out there might find
that they prefer flagship killers like
the f1 or unlocked no warranty
international s tens on marketplaces
like Amazon but for my part if a friend
said to me
look I've got a good job I want
something decent which Android phone
should I get for a noble experience I'd
say if you don't absolutely need a
headphone jack
get a one plus seven pro because the
thing is guys it's all about the
software these days and as we discovered
during our five-year Android vs. iPhone
test there's a reason that oneplus
phones hold their value so darn well
speaking of holding their value well D
brand skins help your device's hold
their value better because they not only
look freaking awesome they also protect
your devices against incidental scuffs
and scratches deep brand skins are
available for laptops phones tablets
consoles controllers and more they're
made from high-quality 3m vinyl that's
true texture and the patented adhesive
is guaranteed to leave no residue on
your device if you ever want to change
the skin their uncompromising precision
and cutting the vinyl ensures a factory
fit for your device and their customer
service robots are easy to work with
they're great deep brand products are
affordable and they ship worldwide so
