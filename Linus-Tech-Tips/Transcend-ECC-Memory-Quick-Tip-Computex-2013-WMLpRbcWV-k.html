2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys i'm here at the
transcend booth and while they weren't
sure exactly of what new announcements
they might have for computex i didn't
notice they had server memory modules
and while we're just over at plextor and
i talked about how we use their job in
our server i thought i would cover ECC
memory module so ECC memory modules
stands for error correcting code
function support or ECC kind of drop off
the function support there it's just ECC
basically what that does is as data runs
through your ram it could have errors in
it and usually the arrows aren't big
enough for your computer to really care
if you're just doing like very basic
applications but on a server they have
to really really make sure that
everything is very proper maybe one
flipped a bit on your computer you will
never notice but in a server you
actually might that could be a really
big deal so they have error correcting
modules that will double check
everything and make sure it's all proper
we are running that in our server
currently we will we were not before and
we did actually have some problems with
our database before we were running ECC
memory so if you've been looking at
memory in the past may or may be
wondering what that little nomenclature
was ECC stands were error correcting
error correcting code I forgot what that
last word was sorry about that thanks
