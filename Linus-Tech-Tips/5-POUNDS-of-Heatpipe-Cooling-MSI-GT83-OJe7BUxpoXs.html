great fitting skin for your device game
console or laptop check them out at the
link in the video description I think I
guess this is it right this is the year
of laptops that defy portability
although I've got to give MSI this
compared to the other entrance in this
apparently flourishing category Acer
with the 21 X Asus with the 800 GX and
Razer with their triple monitor concept
thing at least MSI can lay claim to
being the first to build a monstrosity
like this this is the successor to the
original gt80 Titan the world's first
laptop with a full Cherry MX mechanical
keyboard and at the time what I thought
would be the only one ever but no it has
been refreshed some things haven't been
changed we're still dealing with a 1080p
IPS 60 Hertz display because there just
simply aren't a lot of options from the
panel makers at 18 inches so okay I
guess I get that g-sync would have been
nice at the least though we've still got
the Cherry MX switches now with
individually backlit RGB keys and with a
new switch type so instead of Browns
which I do really like they're using
another switch which we've only seen
before in Corsairs gaming keyboards the
Cherry MX speed to the right of the
speed you've still got that weird
vertical touchpad that I'm not a huge
fan of but I cliffs defense was
something along the lines of hey where
you want me to put a bigger one okay I
guess that's fair and it still turns
into an unlock but the insides have
changed a lot so we ripped or open you
can still get the top panel off to get
access to two of the four ddr4 memory
slots as well as the n dot two slots
which are capable of running in raid and
opening it up here in the bottom oh wow
I have never seen such a beautiful heat
pipe cooling engine in my life this baby
has
three fans two of which are dedicated to
the gtx 1080 GPUs and one of which is
doing most of the heavy lifting on the
core i7 7820 h k cpu and i believe it is
a total of nine heat pipes stacked three
dimensionally all over the inside of
this beast with heat sinks that are
utilizing almost the entire Z height of
what is already one of the thickest
gaming laptops on the market very very
impressive and more impressive still you
might have noticed that is an
overclocking ready skew on the inside of
this laptop not only can the CPU be
overclocked but those GPUs those 1080
SLI GPUs are capable of running at full
non TDP restricted speed according to
the msi reps here though of course I'll
be needing a unit of this to check out
in the lab I'm getting the I'm getting
me I hate you linus nod but we have to
do what you say because you get lots of
views on youtube look in terms of i/o
going back out to the outside we've got
USB 3 on the right we've got a wack ton
more USB 3 on the left we got optical
audio out because frickin yolo i guess i
mean it does have a new audio codec in
it that's you know HD high res or
whatever the case may be it's got an SD
card reader Kensington lock and all the
display out ports you'll probably need
hdmi 2.0 Gigabit LAN Thunderbolt and
mini DisplayPort the one thing really
missing here in my mind is support for
triple external g-sync monitors because
it's the kind of thing I could
conceivably see someone hooking up to
something like this but hey I guess
we'll have to live with that so how do
you power a beast like this MSI's answer
turns out is very similar to clev oh so
they're using a little bridge doodad
here where 2 330 watt power bricks go in
and one plug goes into the back of the
laptop so that's it 660 Watts that's how
they're managing to power all that stuff
so huge shout-out to you guys for
watching I was going to go into the
sponsor spot but first I want to make
sure you guys all subscribe so you don't
miss any of our CES content and a huge
shout out to D brand for allowing us to
be here D brand is the place to go if
you want to skin your phone your
game console your what else do they do
game controller oh yeah SC MSI loves D
brand - is my MSI reps phone I mean it's
kind of an old crappy phone but whatever
you're still cool dude also right now
Saudi brand aside from having a great
product so precision cut genuine 3m
vinyl skins also is offering a $1
worldwide shipping promo for a limited
time so go check them out D brand calm
