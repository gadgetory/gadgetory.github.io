pretty much guarantee that no matter
what device you have you've encountered
thermal throttling of some sort in the
past that is to say that you fire up
some game you like and after 10 15 or 20
minutes of gaming you notice a
significant performance drop now on a
full-size PC we have all kinds of
solutions for these sorts of problems
big heat sinks or water coolers with
giant external radiators but on a phone
you're pretty much limited to what you
got here where are you so we found this
on Aliexpress and it is exactly what it
appears to be a water cooler designed
for use with a mobile phone so let's
take this thing for a test drive and see
if it actually solves the problem and
this video is brought to you by pulse
wave with pulse weight you can remotely
monitor manage and control all your
Windows Mac and Linux machines from one
app create your free account today at
the link in the video description
so if we want to know if our solution is
going to be effective the first thing we
need to do is determine if there's an
actual problem that needs to be solved
in the first place so I've got a galaxy
s 10 plus with a Snapdragon a 55
processor in here and you can see that
it's been sitting idle for quite some
time our processors running at 30
degrees Celsius which is a nice
comfortable temperature for it so we're
gonna go ahead and close down CPU
monitor and we're gonna fire up GFX
bench you've got to be kidding me some
tests are now temporarily disabled well
that's the kind of day this is gonna be
I suppose we're gonna be switching over
to 3dmark sling shot extreme so let's go
ahead and run our benchmark for the
first time okay we got our first results
5569 47 62 we're gonna check our cpu
temps real quick here 52 degrees and
then we're gonna go ahead and start it
again now one of the keys is to make
sure that we're doing our subsequent
runs as rapidly as possible so we're not
giving the device a chance to cool down
if you think about it while you're
gaming it's not gonna have that
opportunity so that makes it a much more
realistic test now I'm going to need to
run these tests a few more times in
order to plot out my throttling curve
where I look at the performance decrease
over time but in the meantime for your
guys's entertainment we can have a look
at the various phone water cooling
solutions that showed up in the mail so
this one seems to be the one that's most
optimized for gaming because you can see
here it's designed to sit on the back of
the phone like this so that you can
comfortably hold your phone in landscape
mode with the water tubes connected to
the bottom of the device like so it
includes a thermal pad one that doesn't
appear to be adhesive in any way and a
bunch of zip ties this one kind of
bewildered me now there are certainly
things that I could think of to do with
the zip ties secure tubing to the
fittings strap the cooler to the back of
the phone I'm just not sure what their
intention was exactly now let's put this
one aside and have a look at our next
candidate
this one really didn't ship with much in
the way of accessories and it's a bit of
a simpler design overall so they've got
a thicker it kind of looks like a heat
pipe that isn't sealed but it's hard to
tell if the inside is sintered like a
heat pipe would be so it could just be a
copper tube but it's got a simpler loop
so just a you instead of zigzagging back
and forth which might interfere with
thermal transfer but like this one it
appears to be soldered on to a thin
copper plate has no protective covering
and obviously is not designed to be used
as easily in landscape mode because if
you were to put it on like this you'd
have to be sticking out kind of between
your fingers off the back of the phone
curiously this one included two thermal
pads not because I think they expect you
to use both of them at the same time but
rather because I think they expect you
might lose one and your you might not be
the sort of person who just has thermal
pad material flying around finally
behind door number three is our smallest
cooler yet but actually the one with the
largest copper tube so this would make
this one likely the least restrictive
one but it's also the one that's going
to make the least amount of actual
physical contact with our phone one good
thing about this design i guess is that
it could be used in either orientation
oh it's done okay fifty sixty eight and
forty two seventy seven actually it
looks like we got a little bit of
throttling already let's check our CPU
temps we are up at 65 degrees this time
bippity Boppity go again please so
that's great then we've already lost 10%
of our performance after less than 10
minutes of running an intensive
application maybe there's something to
this after all so I had to go on coolest
ins Aliexpress page to figure this out I
I'll admit it I had to read the manual
but apparently what they expect you to
do is take your thermal pad peel off the
protective cover put it inside a phone
case and then take this thing
and put it in here and then like drill
out holes in your case or something for
the water cooling tubes yeah we're not
doing that we're just we're just gonna
grab some packing tape and strap this to
the back of it for testing purposes but
there you go for those of you who are
curious that's the answer now that we've
got that figured out we can go ahead and
take a look at some of the other things
that we need the manufacturer of this
very clearly points out that this alone
is not enough to help with federal
throttling now you might actually delay
the throttling because just adding some
mass to the back of the phone that can
absorb heat is going to posit the heat
up a little slower but you still have to
dissipate it and this hunk of copper
doesn't have a ton more surface area
than the back of the device itself so we
need some kind of way to circulate the
water so here's some tubing a pump and a
reservoir and we need some way to
dissipate the heat so I grabbed this
radiator from like an ancient build that
I did like 10 years ago and we're gonna
hook that bad boy up to it now that is a
lot more surface area than the back of
the phone so now things are getting
really interesting
our third OpenGL test didn't drop much
compared to our second one but our third
Vulcan test is now only 75% of the
performance of our original score' that
means that we've actually moved beyond
the point of differences that you can
measure with benchmarks but that don't
matter in the real world to the point
where the animations are noticeably
choppier now than when we first started
our investigation now let's talk about
how we're configuring our cooling system
in a PC you'd be using tubing and
fittings that has like great big inner
diameters so that you can get tons and
tons of water flow but as you can see
with our phone coolers we're going to be
limited by the most restrictive items in
our loop anyway and these are as small
as four millimeters in outer diameter so
we need really tiny tubing in order to
run this thing now the
Oh list G 1/4 fittings that I could find
here in the studio were these 1/4 inch
ones here within this alright these
adorable but even that is still way
bigger especially than the cooler that
we're planning to use so clearly some
adapters are going to be in order here
now one way of adapting larger tubing to
smaller tubing that I've actually seen
done is to just place the smaller tubing
inside and use some kind of a sealant
but we're gonna go slightly less jank
than that today and we're gonna use
these handy little couplers that I found
on mcmaster-carr so these little puppies
are gonna restrict our flow a little bit
because of the shape of the flange and
how they're a little bit under sized but
they're gonna allow us to take our
quarter inch tubing go all the way down
this little tiny one one pro tip is that
if one zip tie is good too must be
better now this is hardly the greatest
water cooling system that we've ever
designed and there's a fairly
significant chance that it'll leak
because the more points of failure the
more chance that yes drip water but we
don't care about that today because for
one thing our leaks won't be anywhere
near our sensitive electronics the
worst-case scenario is we get a little
bit of water dripping down on our table
here and number two is that the purpose
of today's video is not to design the
best phone water cooling system but
rather to determine if this makes sense
at all in the first place so I'm gonna
go ahead and cut these off and we should
be pretty much ready to fill it so our
final results are in after seven runs
we've lost anywhere from 25 to 35% of
our original performance now it's time
for us to see if we can fix it so the
last step here is to put some kind of an
active cooler on our radiator honestly
the thermal output of a phone is so
small that I wouldn't expect it to make
a huge difference but there you go
we're doing it for the sake of
thoroughness and then plug power into
both our fan but through this adapter
and our pump after we put some water in
it because running a pump dry is a
really really bad time
ready make sure you get that in the shot
alright ltte start conference now this
is interesting this is actually quite a
powerful pump but it is really
struggling to move water around the loop
let these tiny little fittings are
definitely a classic bottleneck okay
there we go
we just hit 33 degrees on our phone cpu
so that's exactly the same starting
point that we had when we were running
it by itself without any active cooling
so it's time just strap it on plonk this
on a little something like ooh we just
put a zip tie on it or something now
again this is not designed for long-term
use obviously you wouldn't want a big
ugly zip tie hanging out in the middle
of your screen if you're gaming but you
don't realize how light a phone is until
you strap a big piece of copper to the
back of it like it's heavy and our
benchmark results are actually well
within range for OpenGL but a little bit
higher for Vulcan let's go ahead and run
it again run number two our score is
still exactly the same okay it's jumping
around a little bit but wow it looks
like our temps haven't increased at all
this is now three runs in and our
performance hasn't dropped at all
by comparison last time around on the
third run we were at only 72% of our
peak performance in OpenGL and only 75
in Vulcan so we were already at our
maximum throttle you haven't even
touched it yet okay so the CPU
temperature does go up we can see that
but it rapidly Falls
so our cooler here is doing an excellent
job of pulling that heat away and once
again our benchmark scores are not
affected whatsoever in fact that's our
best score yet for OpenGL I mean this is
gonna be our last run I'm pretty
convinced that this is not
gonna throttle just for funsies here's a
look at the phone through our thermal
camera now this is an imperfect way of
measuring it because it's a bit of a
glossy surface so that does interfere
with our reading but we can at least see
relatively speaking where the hotspots
are right there is one of the hottest
spots of the phone along that edge and
even that is well under control it
barely feels warm to the touch even
while I'm running this game benchmark so
there you have it our scores still
haven't fallen this entire time and our
temperatures start out a little bit on
the higher side but quickly fall back
down to ambient temperature so is it a
bit of a janky solution yeah I think
even under the best of circumstances
this is going to be bulkier and less
convenient than just you know relaxing
in bed with just your phone but does it
work the answer is a resounding
absolutely yes it does water cooling
phones who would a freaking thunk it
