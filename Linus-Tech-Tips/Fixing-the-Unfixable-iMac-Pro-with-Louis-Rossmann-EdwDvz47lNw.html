we need to put together our iMac pro
we've got a new iMac Pro 5k display
we've got a new logic board complete
with CPU and RAM that are by the way
socketed and not soldered on so yeah we
covered that in part two and we have the
one and only Lewis Rosman from Rosman
group time to learn how to put together
an iMac and as I say you should never
learn on your own stuff always learn on
somebody else's way know you're supposed
to learn on your own who like me has
never actually assembled an iMac bro so
let's have some fun today Shelley
sponsored of course by mr. Rothman's
favorite Tool Company I fix it their
screwdrivers have a very nice
personality I fix it as your one-stop
shop for repair tools and guides for
pretty much everything under the Sun you
can check out the link to their pro Tech
tool kit in the video description
so Anthony's laid everything out for us
pretty much we've got our fan component
of the thermal solution we've got all
the pics and adhesive strips and
everything that we should need we've got
their little prop up thing for the
doodad here that goes in there
and then of course is this your first
time seeing an iMac pro logic board in
person this is my first time so why
don't you kind of walk us through some
of the things that are more and/or less
obvious I mean I actually have one right
off the bat here somebody's getting
fired because the RAM is not soldered to
the board for some reason apples gone
with this weirdo configuration with five
DRAM chips per side so normally you
would have four or eight and the the
fifth one is for ECC that's error
checking and that's a feature of the z9w
processor that's in there but why
wouldn't they just put all of them on
the one side why would they be a dual
sided dinner for this maybe to get more
on a single dude these are just eight
gig games maybe they planned on it but
then that person got fired because may
using too much memory would result in
this not not efficient power usage wait
no that was the excuse news in the resin
I mean a lot of people have asked like
why they might have gone with socketed
memory rather than soldering the memory
on because we all know that apples sort
of MO here is making as few components
on the board upgradable by the end use
and the CPU is socketed too that's
another person that's gonna get fired
so I figured it out someone at Apple was
just like you know what if we want to
deliver enough configurations without
spending a bunch of money for the sole
purpose of making things less upgradable
for the user sockets make a lot of sense
more than idea
Apple and if the processor fails you
don't have to buy a new board and what's
the cost of that board you do know it
Apple only sells the logic board as a
complete unit what with the CPU and the
RAM already in it what if you only have
a bad CPU because even though there's
socketed they still treat it like a
single unit so what happens if you have
a bad RAM stick okay that one I don't
know but I know that when we had to buy
the new logic board we had to send back
our CPU and RAM if we wanted to qualify
for replacement
which there's still a chance I heard
from our contact who got us this so
there's still a chance we can get
replacement pricing on it so you have to
send back everything and if you don't
send back everything you don't get
replacement pricing but you get charged
twice the actual price of it which is
ready four times the price that it
should cost at any other computer yes
well so those are standard SSDs you
could buy a new egg right I mean in
their defense their SSDs do perform
pretty well so I'll give them that
but a lot of people asked us where were
you guys opening up and I'm a pro in the
first place it's not meant to be opened
the reason we were opening it was
because we wanted to shed some light on
the cooling solution that Apple is using
for up to an 18 core processor and a
Vegas 64 GPU just looking at it tells us
everything we need to know about how
much this sucker is gonna thermal
throttle and in order for us to take our
thermal throttling results and sanity
check them this is why we were opening
it because we're a review channel and we
know that opening up the product is not
something that everyone's gonna do but
this is a pro product in a professional
environment where you you might actually
have technicians on staff to help people
through both software and hardware
issues it is my expectation that you
would be able to use their service a
professional machine and you would be
able to get the parts that you need is
that an unreasonable thing I think it's
very unreasonable that you expect that
you should be able to clean the dust out
of it three years from now and it's
filled with junk and runs 30 Celsius
hotter when they say that you're not
supposed to open it it's not designed to
be open I can understand that to an
extent but wouldn't you want to open it
so that you can clean it three years
from now there's so many of these old
machines they wind up dying when the
graphics chip start running 20 and 30
Celsius hotter and this design if you
blow compress there and there it's just
going to wind up blowing the dust around
the machine yeah oh here here what we
can do is we can kind of we can kind of
line this up and this is something
that's very difficult to do if you don't
actually open it up and have a look at
it so if you were to blow dust or if you
were to blow air through through this
very thoughtfully designed baffle here
so that you don't get as much noise from
the fan I guess
which is neat if you open any of these
that are more than three years old I
would be surprised that the fan even
spins just based on how much dust
they're in here after a few years so you
would want to open it just to be able to
blow it out and you can't do that in
this machine so it makes sense that
somebody would want to open this and if
not now than a few years from now if
they want it to last always and Apple
wants it to last right is there anything
about this main board that should that
makes it special it does have a GPU
built right into it which is either a
feature or a drawback depending on how
you look at it that's a good board it
has to some extent it has four
Thunderbolt ports four USB ports
Ethernet LAN it does use the same USB C
muxing that the touch bars did and I
remember with the touch bars when I
tried to use a third-party dongle rather
than the original Apple dongle it didn't
work and the original Apple dongle was
like 80 bucks I mean this appliance your
chip said to buy a card with this on it
is about a hundred bucks I can
understand how if it comes with a
graphics card and it's specifically
custom-designed for this machine like I
could see how this board would cost yeah
like I would say this is a solid 800
$900 board okay cool but not $4,000 what
that's how much the non replacement
pricing is if you break the the warranty
void if removed seals on it and when we
priced out the iMac Pro we actually
found that compared to a an
apples-to-apples PC with is neon W like
trying to get feature and performance
parity it was actually pretty darn
similar so it's only when you want to
try to get a replacement part and you
don't have the untouched by
non-authorized technicians like yourself
pricing that you really get owned rammed
yeah I didn't think I'd bring this guy
on and he'd be one toning my language
down the entire machine it's not
necessarily that much of a ripoff
considering the form factor that you get
in it and when you do actually price it
with a display that's for a PC that
would be equal it actually isn't the
terrible deal spec wise it's just if you
ever have anything go wrong with it ever
then you're really screwed I do think
that Apple could do more to design
things not to fail and when you look at
this cooling solution the inability to
clean out the dust we look at the 500
watt power supply like this to me is
common sense stuff when I initially set
out to build a computer there's
a whole freaking a lot to it these days
it's like putting together Lego you got
your form factor which Apple does a
great job of you got your acoustics and
you got your thermals that's step one of
building a computer make sure that it's
not going to overheat and it's not going
to be super loud oh and don't use a
crappy power supply so that it doesn't
blow up in two years I'm just surprised
by the heatsink because I know that in
many of their machines they focus on it
being quiet which is a good thing they
wanted that machine to not make noise
but if you want it to not make noise you
would want a larger heatsink not a
smaller one and what they've done with a
lot of the newer machines they took the
2013/14 design which is actually a
really nice design except the fan just
doesn't turn on for another 20 C okay so
should we get started then they get to
figure out that I don't know how it goes
together yeah I know now now neither of
us looks like an expert yeah I know so
I've done I've done an iMac 5k but I've
never done an iMac Pro like in terms of
disassembly and reassembly have you done
an iMac 5k no oh really it's time I
reassembled on iMac was 2012 or 13th
most of what we do is liquid damage
repairs but you got to be pretty special
to spill water on here
yeah like water typically goes down not
beside this you'd have to be drinking
water over a bare board sitting on a
table and it into your iMac or someone
has to say something really funny you
have one thing that sucks with this form
factor at least for the older ones is
that if you want to replace the hard
drive you have to remove the screen to
get to the drive and the screen cable is
short so when people take the screen out
they don't realize that they have to
hold the screen on their chest
they don't do that they just take the
screen out like this they wind up
ripping the screen connector right off
the board okay so do we want to put this
no you know I mean no just the opposite
should be okay right well hold on a
second cuz we've got we've got brackets
in here called like Wi-Fi and stuff so I
want to make sure that we're that's this
has Ethernet though right that's one
thing that I have to say I love about
Apple they're wireless it's just
they're the only ones that I'm aware of
that do a 3x3 by in in a notebook
because everyone else is using the mini
pcie standard that is just not
physically large enough to do a three by
so this looks like some kind of sense 4G
power supply I guess okay so hold on
we've probably got two got to put this
put this lead in oh okay that one comes
around as well hmm okay this guy's
blocking you hold on hold on oh that's
lifting up some kind of cover that
probably serves some kind of purpose
here hold on okay it covers coils yeah
covers things that you shouldn't touch I
guess this if I can kind of guide you in
here stay up cables you really go ham
like it's funny cuz I get a lot of flack
for just kind of like going for it with
stuff oh yeah but as far as we know this
board works so please do be very careful
good no pressure
why did I fly in from here to do this
for me so I could learn there we go now
we're now we're getting in there huh
there we go not a Bing okay all right so
it's like being a dentist that's like
say yes say yeah yeah okay do we want to
screw it in first maybe I know we wanted
to see if it works before you screw it
in it's bad luck to screw it in before
you see if it works so my thing is I
don't close the panel first but I I'm
willing to screw in a board I'll put in
at least a couple screws cuz I don't
like I don't like motherboard sliding
around on standoffs oh yeah can I put in
two screws okay okay stressing out here
one thing about working on a PC like
this that legitimately should require
certification and legitimately is
dangerous for the average person is the
fact that it has exposed things on the
capacitors on their power supplies no
there's no no no there's nothing that
goes on here it's just like this
that is extremely dangerous you could
die this this is nothing this is no
tongue-in-cheek haha Apple or anything
like that just I've never actually seen
another finished goods product like this
with an exposed power supply like that
and as far as I can tell the only reason
they've done it
is so that they can use the cooler unit
here to cool the power supply without
having its own fan which would because
of the thin form factor be quite small
and therefore whining I'm surprised they
didn't put at least some sort of cage
over it but happened to be grounded so
that if the somebody was going into
let's say clean their fan they don't do
that this is one of those things where I
like to joke in my videos but I would
not want to touch that
and there is a good chance of somebody
opening this and actually hurting
themselves even if it's unplugged
because those two capacitors will stay
charged for a long time after a long
time sometimes months or even years you
don't mess around with that stuff now
actually on the subject of these things
being exposed a lot of people have asked
us what exactly happened because the way
that we showed our iMac pro failure was
in the form of like a reenactment
because obviously the camera wasn't
rolling while we well we dropped the
display yeah those sparks those master
after-effects drawn sparks very real I
know we deceived everyone believed in
you up so what actually happened was
when Anthony was removing the display he
bridged something in here and it caused
a spark which startled him and caused
him to drop the display that was what
actually happened and because the spark
was on the motherboard that's why from
the very beginning we have deceived no
one we knew we definitely had a broken
display but we knew we also possibly had
a dead motherboard and therefore by
extension a dead power supply actually
the spark was off the power supply
wasn't it so you know what's funny a
shield would have prevented all of this
a shield would prevent about how
interesting so sorry the spark on the
power supply so you know when you short
out a power supply you can kind of kill
almost anything downstream and because
on this particular machine the power for
everything runs through the motherboard
it was probably gonna burn something on
the motherboard before it carried
through to something else so that was
where our conclusion came from we knew
we definitely had a dead screen because
it was cracked
we knew that we potentially had a dead
power supply and a dead motherboard but
that our other components probably
worked with that said I've seen a lot of
shorts occur in my day that have not
resulted in dead hardware or I've seen
them partially fail
like oh well now that USB port doesn't
work anymore yeah if you send 12 volts
to the five volt rail your machine's
dead if you send 12 volts to ground you
just saw a big spark but it's nothing
that's gonna actually kill it Wow you
know those viewers are right this is
really complicated because I mean the
whole thing like oh these are it's like
a supercar you saw those comments right
it's not designed to be you know taken
apart and put together and I'm kind of
like well then how does Apple you know
take it apart and put it together
because they can they just wouldn't
we're good so here's another thing that
would definitely require training the
screws for the power supply and for just
generally mounting the motherboard are
threaded the same as far as I can tell
but they should not be confused because
the power supply ones have these washers
on them and they are actually designed
we were talking about this off-camera
how does the power supply connect to the
motherboard it's actually through screw
screw connections here so these ones
with the little kind of mark next to
them that looks like it's a little oval
shaped mark those ones use the silver
screws and then everything else uses the
black ones that is a bit of a trick and
you would need to be very careful with
something like that oh not that one
please do that moment when you bring in
like a celebrity repair technician and
it turns out maybe you should have
gotten a real repair technician you know
yeah in all seriousness though this is
not very difficult as it just takes
about five minutes should an Apple
Authorized service provider like is
there any justifiable reason why they
shouldn't be able to just stock
replacement parts for an operation like
this and be able to turn a board swap
around for a customer in a day the
reason that they don't want them to have
parts in stock is because they're afraid
of them ending up on the open market or
on eBay or being result like that data
recovery tool that I had bought for the
new touch bar MacBooks I got it from
some likely authorized service center
that was selling all of them on the side
the downside of it is that if the parts
are not stocked the customer has to wait
one to three weeks to get it in if you
tell somebody it's going to take longer
than 2 to 5 days they just walk out of
the store this is an entirely different
story imagine for a second that I'm not
some youtuber also a celebrity tech
you know imagine that I bought this
$5,000 machine so that I could run my
you know home graphic design business
imagine that someone told me this is
gonna cost more to repair than I
initially spent on it how does that make
any sense the thing that made me most
furious was the people acting like that
argument made any sense that a machine
could be a total write-off when not
every component of it was dead and no
broadcast facility is going to allow
that any sort of recording studio any
sort of video or news editing room they
expect that there be virtually no
downtime they're gonna have a machine to
swap in a place and they expect to be
able to repair this because they're
using it for real work not to mention
for a reasonable price I expect when I
buy a replacement piece of something
whether it's a car or a vacuum cleaner
that if I were to buy every piece of it
and assemble it myself
it should cost a little bit more but I
don't expect that if I were to buy all
the pieces as replacement parts that the
machine would cost literally double even
if I'm putting it together myself that
doesn't make any sense
anyone making the argument that Apple
can't sell it to me for for cheaper
because they've got to make money their
business is clearly not doing the math
because if Apple couldn't afford to sell
me this board for around $1,000 then
they couldn't afford to build this
computer I think I do stone this one so
the the Wi-Fi thing is also a little bit
tricky you've got to slide it into four
little notches on these shields right
here SD card area thing the card reader
is over here somewhere so it's over here
somewhere oh it's to hold down that new
deaden okay let's not turn this into a
competition of which of us has done
worse because that's not gonna be that's
not we were talking about credibility
earlier you know that's not gonna help
either well the thing is sometimes I'll
have I'll read out the letter that
somebody sent in with their machine so
they'll know ok he's working on mine and
then when I'm streaming it they'll see
like me saying okay this is just for
Thunderbolt but screw this let us take
the saddle and go wink wink wink and
then he'll get a call later saying
excuse me was that my machine that he
just ripped the Thunderbolt USB and
Wi-Fi circuitry off and then I'll have
to explain to him no he's joking he's
gonna put that back when you get
and then I'll like walk over to me and
say did you stream knocking all that
stuff over you watch these videos before
you sent it to you you must have been
expected like you know what you're
getting it's not like it's false
advertising so this is like me and my
wife like I'll make some sort of like
really offensive off-color joke and I'm
just like hon I mean we were dating for
six or seven years before we got married
you knew what you knew yes video when
people watch the live streams of their
stuff getting fixed I can only imagine
how stressful that is because of the
show that I put on for what you're
saying everything you see on TV is not
you know an accurate reflection of real
life you put on a show no way I think
the real takeaway here is that if we can
handle this
apples store probably could have handled
all right let's see if we get fan spin
it may not actually do that now there's
a lot of there's a lot of stuff where it
into the display not just fans mail we
did we're done yeah so I can go put the
panel back on that's the whole point
fans fin that's what was broken fan
spins so this is the one actually like
special thing that you need and it's a
part that I fix it sells if you were to
take apart and put back together and I'm
at 400 other than that you just need
like a screwdriver a couple of Torx bits
nothing nothing really special like
you'd be surprised how many repairs you
only really need a pretty basic toolkit
for this is the hardest part of this
repair actually is finding the proper
adhesive and this goes back almost ten
years with this stuff is that if you can
open it up you can it's it's putting it
back together that's difficult yeah
because if you tried it if you just go
to Home Depot and try to find adhesive
that fits it's just gonna fall right out
oh they sent to just take it they knew
who they were I fix it does sell really
good adhesive toolkits for these
machines I'll say well no I was saying
they sent two they clearly knew who they
were dealing with all yeah expected me
to screw it up once we brought up the
guide for putting on the strip's you
really don't want to screw this up
because they're one-time use oh holy
crap they've got like eight steps for
each strip they really they really walk
you through the steps there I think I
can handle this
I ended up picking the Dutch side it
should be noted that there's not
actually that much pressure on you
because we are gonna take it apart again
for sure to do our iMac pro repair guide
which is what we were trying to do in
the first place I'm offended of being in
a video with foul language it's so
frustrating to me that Apple tries to
create this like you know mystique
around how difficult these machines are
to repair and the really frustrating
thing is that it works
we had these comments from people who
think that it's more than printed
circuit boards capacitors wiring and
stickers I think a lot of people have
bought into the idea that this is kind
of a utopia and in some ways it is you
know did the software is easier to use
it didn't crash as much when Vista was
out it looks nice on maybe clearly I
don't watch your videos there are at
least 1000 MacBook Airs out there with
the adhesive applied like that yeah they
think they think it's the Utopia so that
if some anything goes wrong it has to be
their fault or it has to be your fault
it couldn't be that they did something
wrong so so people wind up denying their
own experience when they have a problem
like I remember seeing this one thread
in 2011 world so many people were saying
you're wrong this machine doesn't run
too hot you must have been doing
something wrong you must have got dust
in it you got a defense you must have
been running it too hard yeah and it
Roenick ly on their own page it says you
know 70% faster with video editing than
last year's model and all you were
trying to do is that it's some video oh
I screwed it up oh I really missed
that's what the finger knows if you hold
on hold on hold on I got I got this I
got this
I don't want it fold it you definitely
don't want two layers of it cut if it's
a little bit ah shoot no that's really
bad actually I gave you so much for your
application of the first couple then I
screwed up the last one dang it that's
Karma for you do you want to do the
ribbons and I'll hold the screen yeah
let's move it closer to the edge yes
that's actually do that now to pretend
that we didn't forget to plug the
microphone some reason they use that
connector for the webcam on the MacBook
so I thought that that was a webcam
Zapata's screen by the way for those
watching at home this is the smarter way
to handle these recessed screws on the
queer you just put them in the rubber
grommet first then screw them in it was
all going very smoothly yes nothing is
broken you that we know it's best if you
have somebody hold the screen while
you're plugging things in so that you
don't drop the screen or there's always
the chest or you or use your chest
because it's very easy to drop this
that's the manly way you have to have
bigger packs than me for it to really
work very well I have more men moved it
than pecs myself it's good to use your
nails rather than on the edge of the
connector over here so you're gonna see
it's kind of shaped like an L and don't
be afraid to just push it in on the
edges don't try to push the whole thing
in at once that's very difficult and
then you can plug in the screen connect
it without breaking it and we'll try not
to drop anything in the power supply
this time famous last words
moment of truth come on come on over
here Brandon I want people to know we're
not faking anything there's no
reenactments so we got fan spin how do
we get Apple logo something you do that
was there very antique Leblon holding
the screen with my good hand crash
should we go like the top gun the top
gun style high-five do you know the the
high-five they do in Top Gun okay you
got it you got to go over here just so
I'm gonna end with the screen being drop
okay yeah so I think that's pretty much
it massive thank you to absolutely
everyone who was involved in this thank
you to Anthony for breaking our iMac Pro
because otherwise we never would have
really started this conversation about
right to repair and apples policies here
we would have had no way of knowing that
it was going to be so difficult to
repair a professional-grade machine
thanks to our community who really
stepped up and helped us out getting
this thing fixed for a reasonable price
well we can throw our total bill of
materials up here compared to what Apple
would have charged us we can do that
right huge thanks to Luis rossmann for
showing up and helping
be reassembled
was a lot of fun thanks to iFixit of
course for providing us with the
adhesive strips and the tools we need as
well as their awesome online guides for
disassembly and reassembly of your
electronics and of course for sponsoring
this third installment of this video
series and thank you to you guys for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts just
like this one and our community forum
which you should definitely join can you
buy screens and boards to Apple products
on your merch store no you cannot extra
for the people who stayed till the end
yes we are aware of the serialization
process for Apple main boards don't ask
any questions but this does work with
FaceTime and iMessage and all that stuff
