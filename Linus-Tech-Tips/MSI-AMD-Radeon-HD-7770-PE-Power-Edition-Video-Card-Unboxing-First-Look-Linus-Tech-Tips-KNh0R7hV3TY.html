the msi radeon 7770 power Edition this
is featuring triple over voltage which
means you can overbill pretty much any
aspect of the video card that you could
possibly want to which as you guys may
or may not have figured out at this
point is better for overclocking more
voltage means more clock speed as long
as you have the cooling to back it up
and this particular SKU gives you a lot
of different options in terms of the
cooling so first let's go with you know
what it has so it's an AMD Radeon 7770
so you got you know your power play your
power tune your crossfire support your
Eyefinity support HD 3d support HDMI 1.4
ASA for Dolby true HD and DTS HD master
audio is but all of that good stuff 1
Giga memory it is a pcie 3.0 card
manufactured on the 28 nanometer process
technology which means it is extremely
power to power 10 power efficient and
performs well and it comes with a dual
molex to PCI u 6 pin adapter it comes
with a fan that's a strange inclusion
it comes with a propeller blade fan this
looks an awful lot like a VGA fan but
the confusing thing about that is that
the video card has a fan on it now it's
got a DVI to VGA adapter some
documentation and a disc that you
shouldn't use you should download the
latest from in terms of drivers and from
the msi website in terms of utilities
like msi afterburner which is an awesome
overclocking utility speaking of
overclocking what about the 7770 power
additions so all right you got your DVI
you got the HDMI ya opens okay you got
your
DisplayPort so all that's pretty typical
you got your MSI logo which is typical
as long as the cards made by MSI if the
card was made by someone else and having
them aside local that would look a
little weird okay you got your PCIe 6
pin power connector
you got your crossfire fingers right
there so you can connect your crossfire
bridge this card only supports two-way
crossfire it is a mid-range card as a
- the 7900 series which supports
multi-way crossfire configurations pcie
3.0 16x which is pretty much what we're
used to seeing now let's get to the meat
and potatoes of this particular unboxing
so you can see we've got our nice
aluminum fin cooling solution going on
here we've got a center fan which is
blowing the air towards the fins and
cooling the GPU each other sidewall bow
duel fan cooling solution so you take
this little pin but a wire thing right
here you plug it into these pins right
there and then you can you know manage
the cables somehow it comes with screws
so you can fix it more permanently and
there you go you now have a dual fan
cooled card but wait there's more hold
on so you can see the the heatsink
covers the entire card so you can
experience up to you know five degrees
better temperatures by going with this
solution now check this out if you over
it I guess I can leave this on if you
don't mind turning it from a dual slot
card see two slots into a triple slot
card you can also do this so this is
just clips right here just slide it back
and forth in fact you can even position
the fan here if you wanted or here it's
totally up to you so if you put it back
in the normal position you can actually
build yourself like like a double
cheeseburger video card just by slapping
that on there which gives you more
pressure but not necessarily a ton more
airflow but definitely more static
pressure which is good for pushing air
through radiator fins or heatsink mins
and but turns it into a triple slaw card
so there you go that's pretty much it
that is the three different ways you can
configure the radio I'm 7770 power
edition in terms of cooling don't forget
