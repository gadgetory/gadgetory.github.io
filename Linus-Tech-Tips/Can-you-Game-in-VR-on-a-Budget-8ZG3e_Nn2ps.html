the next paradigm for gaming an
immersion ever since it rolled out then
rolled over back in the late 90s with
early implementations like Sony's
Glastron being described by John Carmack
as like looking through toilet paper
tubes fast forward to 2016 though and
the tech was awesome but it still had a
big problem the price because on top of
the headset gamers in particular needed
to shell out for much more powerful
hardware than they would need to play
the same game in flat mode but there's
some good news
since that time oculus who sponsored
this video has dropped the price of the
rift and continued development on some
pretty neat invisible mechanisms that
work in the background to make VR run on
even relatively modest machines and we
spent the last week testing to see just
how modest a machine you can use and I
think you'll be surprised
let's begin with some of the efficiency
improvements that are handled by your
graphics card because in theory every
frame of an image in VR needs to be
rendered twice once for each I so
technologies like Nvidia's single pass
stereo make it so your PC only needs to
setup the scenes geometry once and their
lens matched shading actually cuts off
any pixels which would not be visible
anyway due to how the lenses in the
headset work pretty neat then we've got
the headset specific tech like oculus is
asynchronous time warp and space warp
which kick in anytime your machine can't
maintain the steady 90 frames per second
that's required to prevent motion
sickness by generating synthetic
preemptive frames that act like a sort
of suspension mechanism to smooth out
the low FPS bumps getting this tech
working right was quite a bit of work
because GPUs are designed for high
throughput but not pre-emptive frame
guessing so oculus worked with both GPU
manufacturers as part of invidious VR
works and AMD's liquid VR initiatives so
it's more than a catchy slogan now let's
introduce our bare minimum system so we
paired up where is it here is a core i3
8100 quad-core processor and a gtx 1050
Ti and ran future marks VR mark which
has a neat feature both the rifts
minimum and V are ready performance
requirements are baked into the results
craft and what we found was that even
our bottom of the barrel actually
managed to meet the minimum spec bar so
there you go
video done peace out right no yeah
no wrong so upon further analysis we
actually found that while our rig was
outputting 90 frames per second in the
basic orange benchmark which matches up
with the refresh rate of the
head-mounted displays in the rift the
actual target is 100
9 frames per second this is because
aside from the graphics going on on the
screen in VR the system also needs to
read sensors and do a bunch of stuff in
the background so with the overhead of
VR the calculation is that a hundred and
nine frames per second in flat mode
should correspond to 90 frames per
second in VR and superposition basically
said the same thing so that setup was
only good enough for like the very
barest minimum spec so we do need to go
a little higher but do we go for CPU or
GPU well we were watching our CPU load
pattern during the runs and our
processor even though it's a measly core
i3 well it is a quad core and it didn't
look that busy so we bumped our graphics
up to a GTX 1060 to see where that would
get us usually people would pair such a
card with an i-5 class chip but we're
focusing on VR here and even with all
the trickery it is still mostly GPU
bound and check this out
so it turns out that I 3 + 10 60 combo
here actually looks good to go with a
super rating in VR Marc orange room and
a full bar in superpositions optimum
preset so that puts our total system
cost at just over nine hundred US
dollars and bear in mind but that is
including the Windows 10 home operating
system which microsoft recently jacked
up to a hundred and forty bucks so if
you already have windows or whatever
then now you can subtract that of course
though those are synthetics so the next
step is to go lab rat mode and put this
to the test now normally I game in VR at
home on a gtx 980ti so i will be able to
tell the difference if this doesn't
manage to stay as smooth so let's fire
up the oculus performance profiler
analysis tool and head-up display which
should help us pinpoint the cause of any
framerate drops that we experience oh
cool okay so this is Aki
redesigned home interface thing now
you've got this control panel here that
you can move to wherever it is that you
want it to go and then you can go ahead
and decide well you know which menu do
you want to see oh close them so there's
my library
there's my explore tab here then you can
kind of adjust this one over here
Oh neat you can interact with the
desktop as well oh that's trippy
let's go ahead and look at the other
monitor the one that's not capturing my
experience right now ah yes hey you can
mess with Ivan hey Ivan I am opening
your Start menu what are you gonna do
about it
in fact you oh wait I probably shouldn't
open fraps oh that just glitched it out
I don't know I don't know what this
thing is
yeah thank you let's get our you
monitors different sizes yep one is 4k
one is 1080
dang it Ivan game now right walk around
the place somewhere because she didn't
mean it social so you can invite people
to come over to your virtual home
friends currently zero friends online
thanks that's why you wanted me to open
that isn't it alright what's next
I've played VR shooters dang it yeah
it's really fun all right well I think
that's good I think that's all the
evidence I need this is working awesome
so for our last trick we're trying out
the climb kind of the crisis of VR if
you think about it that way like the
graphics in this game or especially when
it was first released are pretty
incredible compared to what else there
is
now what I just alright oh that's a long
way to fall huh this is maximum settings
yeah go go go go look at me I'm like
Superman oh-oh-oh
Superman falls sometimes ok so actually
that went surprisingly well but still
the point remains that in a massive
surprise to no one just because a
benchmark gives you a good score and you
can run many VR games well on a
relatively inexpensive budget does not
automatically mean that you can run any
game maxed out in VRS I mean same ideas
in flat mode right so just like flat
mode if you do have some more budget and
you're buying a VR gaming rig it
wouldn't be a terrible idea to bump your
specs a little if you want to play VR
versions of flat games like fallout 4
and Skyrim since VR is more demanding
but frankly I've actually found that the
most fun that I've had is in games that
were designed for VR and what's cool is
that the climb in my opinion is more of
a tech demo than an actual game and that
one still ran decently and most of the
VR games out there that I've tried some
of which are good and free like Robo
recall are not nearly as demanding
because it's in the developers best
interest to reach as many customers as
possible with their games so our PC
right here and of course we're not
factoring in some of the RGB nonsense
and stuff like that in our in our cost 4
but our PC here can enable a ton of
awesome VR experiences exactly the way
it is so thanks to you guys for watching
thanks to oculus for sponsoring this
video if you guys dislike this video you
can hit that button but if you liked it
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
is anyone wearing an LT t-shirt not no
one where's your team spirit like the LT
t-shirts that we have and also our
community forum which you should totally
