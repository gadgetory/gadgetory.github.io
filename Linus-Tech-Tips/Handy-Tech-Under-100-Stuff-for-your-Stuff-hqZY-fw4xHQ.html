tag under a hundred whoa okay
cool anyway today I've got something to
make your life easier something to make
it safer and something to make it handy
er er so let's get into it
check out the ltte merch store at the
link in the video description
we've got shirts mugs stickers hats and
more our first item comes in right at
$99.99 technically under $100
the Orrico duck 10p is a smart charging
station equipped with 10 USB ports and
10 slots hold your phones tablets and
well you can also get a little bit
creative this thing is great for
business use like if you work at a
restaurant where they take orders my
iPad but I can also see it coming in
handy for technophiles and large
families too because you only need one
wall outlet to output up to 12 watts per
port and have to charge even
power-hungry tablets at normal speed the
up to 12 watts per port bit is important
because the duck 10p will actually sense
the requirements of each connected
device and provide only the appropriate
amount of power and it even acts as a
surge protector with active cooling
through its cooling hole anyway the fan
only spins up once the unit reaches 60
degrees Celsius so it's really quiet and
it's got the appropriate thermal
protections including a safety shutdown
at a hundred degrees and ABS plastic
construction that's fire retardant rated
to 750 degrees Celsius lots of people
don't realize how important it is to
charge your devices and this is not just
note 7s away from flammable materials it
comes in this color as well as black has
non-skid feet and has a nice tactile
on/off switch but I do wish that the
holders were padded so that vibrating
alerts weren't quite so loud and I would
like to see one or two USB type-c or
fast charging ports then while we're at
it some USB cables would be nice I get
that they don't know what cables you
need but it just feels a little bit
incomplete coming with nothing
thankfully you can get packs of colorful
USB cables this one was eight bucks
shipped in two days and keep your
charging station looking proud or you
could just get one of these have you
ever
struggled to just plug in your freaking
charger onto your phone the Volta cable
is an elegant solution for the first
world list of all problems now you can
give future you the gift of a no-hassle
magnetic charging cable for just $20
taxes not included shipping not included
other charges may apply okay but
seriously in the box
you've got one cable they're available
from 50 centimeters to 2 meters and two
cabled tips the cable tips are either
micro USB USB type-c or lightning and
they sit in your device a little
something like this pretty much forever
when it's time to charge you just bring
your phone close to your cable and well
BAM
it connects regardless of the
orientation hmm let's see that again the
benefit works the other way too like a
MagSafe it's more likely to break free
if you accidentally snag your cord and
when it's time to go you can literally
just pick up your phone and walk away
another cool thing if you're in an inter
platform relationship you can buy extra
tips so that your Android and iPhone can
finally share the same cable the cables
themselves come in four colors have a
lifetime warranty and due to their
apparently military-grade tangle free
nylon are strong enough to pick up a
brick but then again so was this
ratchet-ass ipod classic charger so yeah
last but also least least expensive that
is is this nifty little micro SD card
holder if you're a GoPro Hero
that is to say someone who shoots a lot
of action cam footage not someone who is
an action cam or you're a media hoarder
who likes to carry a large movie
collection with you on the go you will
love the SD card holder this one fits 10
micro SD cards as well as one standard
sized SD card or card adapter the slots
are keyed so you can only insert the
cards one way protecting the electrical
contacts and each slot has its own
independent locking tab to keep cards
from falling out
the whole thing has the dimensions of a
standard credit card
just a touch thicker and to my surprise
it can actually fit in a wallet as
advertised plus it's got a handy
keychain hole for bonus points you can
head over to the Immaculate SD card
holder comm website and get your very
own personalized SD card holder in any
color you want as long as it's one of
these colors but if I were you I'd be
ready to order by phone because the
email request form is taking a break at
this time and man that's a terrible
sight I guess another option would be to
just use the label maker that you bought
back in handy tech episode 7 to label
your slots in your card holder bringing
us to the full disclosure part of these
videos since handy Tech is structured
more as a recommendation to buy with
links to Amazon below rather than
unbiased reviews we like to disclose why
we chose the items we did and how we
acquired them from the top or a co
emailed us and we said yeah sure send
that over that thing looks freakin sick
and they did and it was sick so here it
is other than that for the voltage
charge cables I've actually been trying
to get something similar from a company
called snaps that ended up being flaky
as heck so when these guys reached out I
jumped on it and as for the colored USB
cables and the micro SD card holder
which I haha there it is we ordered
these from Amazon using that YouTube
cash money so thanks guys for watching
Pandy tag under a hundred Corsairs one
gaming pc is fast quiet and small it's
built with premium be blasted aluminum
highlighted by subtle ambient lighting
effects and it's got the horses under
the hood where it counts it's powered by
msi geforce gtx graphics cards air
cooled or liquid cooled and the core i7
7700 processor the base model runs air
cooling but the rest are all cooled with
water inspite of the small size and
their use of standard components that
allow the user to
upgrade in the future it's very quiet
producing just 20 decibels at idle and
you can learn more through the links in
the video description we also reviewed
