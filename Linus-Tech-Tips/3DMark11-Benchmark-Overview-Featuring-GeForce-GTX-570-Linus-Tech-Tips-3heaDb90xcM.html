options available with this system from
NCIX you guys remember we showed you the
prototype process as well as some of the
design procedures that we go through
here at NCIX so we actually have a new
graphics card that came out today this
is the nvidia geforce gtx 570 so we've
got a couple of those so we're showing
the performance edition of this tower
which features the TX a 50 watt power
supply the storage Drive duel cards h70
as well as faster memory alright so this
all comes in the fractal design define
XL case now there's another thing that
came out today and I wish this video was
a little bit better than it is because
what happened is 3dmark11 came out we
were like yeah okay let's throw some gtx
570 s in the Vesta 6050 prototype and
let's find out how well it runs except
the SLI is not supported in 3dmark 11 on
the gtx 570 just yet so we got under the
extreme preset a score of 1687 so
remember we are running an i7 950
processor we've got 12 gigs of ram and
we've also got for all intents and
purposes a single gtx 570 so i can go
ahead and let's start running 3dmark11
here i can figure out how to do it there
we go run extreme so I want to obviously
we're not going to make it all the way
through the test but I want to talk a
little bit about the different tests so
test number one has no tessellation
heavy lighting from multiple sources and
so remembered 3dmark11 is a directx 11
benchmark so we're actually even though
test number one doesn't have any
tessellation other tests are using
tessellations so tests two and test3
both use medium tessellation with media
lighting and then with one light and
then test number four uses extensive
tessellation with many different lights
so actually here yeah you can see test
number one is running at a whopping nine
FPS so we can check out those submarines
I I can't wait until it's like every
every 3dmark releases like this you're
like oh man this looks so cool I can't
wait to like
actually like see what's going on
because I have a decent framerate so
yeah I can't wait for like GTX 980 or
whatever we're finally going to be able
to see what it looks like when it's
running butter smooth anyway there's two
cpu tests which has been the tradition
well at least for the last release of
3dmark so the first one does a lot of
rigid body physics there's a fixed
resolution so no matter what preset
you're running at it's going to run at
the same low res because it is only
testing the physics calculations and
then unlike the previous 3dmark Vantage
the other physics test also has by the
way it supports direct compute so that
means your graphics card is going to
chip in whether you're using nvidia or
ati but it also runs at the resolution
of the rest of the tests it does some
physics stuff but it also has a lot of
other stuff going on including
tessellation and including lighting
effects so that's pretty cool because
that one is probably the closest out of
everything here to what a real gaming
workload is going to look like because
it relies both on the CPU as well as the
GPU in order to do all of the rendering
and calculations and all that good stuff
so thanks for checking out this little
video on our 3dmark11 score with the gtx
570 i guess it was also kind of an
overview of 3dmark11 as a whole and
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I know the lightest
is here I don't know why this is here
can I have my head back no hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
