unboxing today of the bfg GS series
power supply now I have specifically the
550 watt model so this may not
necessarily apply to the other models
but I think most of the same rule should
be the same for both of them that was
awkward okay so basically you got dual
12 volt rails ok it's PCI Express data
connectors thermal control technology
protection circuitry I'm not even sure
if you're gonna be able to read this
you've got a mean time between failure
rating of greater than 80,000 hours and
high efficiency so that did it did it
did it up to eighty-five percent
efficient so even though I don't
actually see an 80 plus certification
bear in mind that 80 plus certification
does not necessarily mean that the power
supply does not comply with a d-plus
even if it doesn't have the
certification because the certification
does cost money so even if you built an
efficient power supply if you don't
submit it for the cert then you just
don't have it but it might still be 80
plus okay so BFD is claim here is that
the efficiency oh yeah that's not even
close to 80 plus anyway so they're
saying that here we go right there
they're saying that on 120 volt or 115
volt input it's around seventy-five
percent at the lowest around 82 82
percent at fifty percent and then it
goes down to about 75% again if you load
it up all the way which is pretty
typical for a modern power supply I mean
given that this one is such a value it's
such a low price it's pretty much what
you would expect um see if I can just
get this Oh eater this is not going very
well for me
okay so oh actually here's another thing
that they call out on the front of the
box so fully sleeves cables which is
really nice to see on a value power
supply it makes it so you can do a nice
tidy build with something like this six
pin and eight pin pci express imagine a
video card company properly taken care
of you for the pci express connectors
right then you've got a 24 pin power
connector you got sada and you got an 8
pin 4 plus 4 pin for the cpu which is
again pretty nice to see on just like a
550 watt fairly basic model power supply
so inside we are going to find a power
supply quick install guide hey something
about power to the people and that's
basically gonna have how to install a
power supply at about umpteen billion
different languages which is great and
then we have for installation screws ok
thanks bfg usually your case will come
with those screws but it's nice of them
to include it just in case ok and then
we have nothing else in there you got
some foam packaging make sure it doesn't
get damaged in transit and then you've
got a power like a standard PC power
cord so that's just your bone standard
sort of thing ok then you surrounded in
bubble wrap in addition to the phone
that was also in there so that'll
protect the finish on it a little bit
alright so let's have a look at the unit
itself here first it's got kind of a
shiny sort of slightly brushed looking
metal finish ok it's uh there's my
camera so you can kind of see behind my
cameras well you could see the LCD that
I'm watching myself in right now at the
back you've got your standard honeycomb
grille with Oh actually you do have to
select ok so it does not have active
power factor correction you have to
actually decide whether you want 115 or
230 volt input make sure you don't have
that set wrong ok then you've got your
on/off switch you got your power plug
and then on this side you're going to
find all of the basic specs of this
power supply so you can see it's got two
12 volt rails each of which are rated at
18 amps and between the two of them they
can provide 404 watts of the total 550
watts that this power supply is rated
for all right so that's all the
pertinent information there on the
bottom you will find what appears to be
a 155 millimeter fan with a nice fan
grill a nice little bfg logo which if I
can get the sticker off and I'll be able
to
see that's so shiny very nice okay in
terms of connectors so they tell you
things like it has SATA connectors but
they don't actually tell you how many on
the outside of the box which is a very
very odd thing to me okay so actually
elbows are a reasonable length those are
for these are pretty good like for like
a value power supply so you can kind of
get some idea the scale here I mean when
they say fully sleeves I think they're
you know exaggerating a little bit but
honestly if you get a cual this this is
higher quality sleeving than you see on
most brand-name power supplies even if
it is a reasonably high in power supply
you can see that even on the 24-pin
connector you can't really see the color
of the cables underneath because it's a
nice high density mesh over top of it
whereas a lot of them they you can just
see kind of right through it and it's
all colorful anyway so let's get started
having a look at what connectors we have
so that is your 20 + 4 pin or 24 pin if
you will alright so then the next thing
we've got here is a ok oh yeah two PCI
Express so you've got a six plus two so
an 8-pin and then you've got another
6-pin PCI Express then next we've got an
8-pin or four plus four pin if you will
cpu power connector ok that's pretty
straightforward as well and then we've
only got three other cables so I'll be
interested to see what's actually
attached to these all right on oh this
is kind of a weird configuration ok
first of all we've got one cable here
that has three molex connectors on it
alright so that's one of them and then
the other two both have P have SATA
connectors ok so we've got two SATA
connectors on each of these so 12 there
the first two on both of them 12 and
then the third connector on both of
these cables here so we got one two
three connectors on both is either a
floppy connector or another molex
connector so that's kind of a neat
configuration anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing at the bfg GS
550 watt power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
