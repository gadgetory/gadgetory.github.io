newsletter a little while back because I
bought something from Dell and got
signed up by accident
thanks Dell but every once in a while I
do see something interesting in there a
two hundred dollar laptop you say maybe
that would be great for a back-to-school
feature but our rep over there is a
regular viewer so he was understandably
hesitant to send us a base model of
anything and said he'd prefer if we
checked out the $400 version so this
thing then well there are three
compelling reasons not to buy it
CyberPower pcs lineup of gaming desktops
feature intel seventh generation core i7
processors check them out at the link
below
reason number one not to buy this $400
laptop this $200 one the best part of
the little blue Inspiron p 2040 is the
price the keyboard is pretty cramped the
TN screen is kinda poop and it's far
from fast but it does exactly what it
needs to do and honestly exceeded our
expectations for the price like come on
this thing is hardly more than the cost
of the included full copy of Windows 10
and after a bit of practice I was able
to type quickly and easily write Word
documents and forum posts with it thanks
to the small but comfortable matte
surface touchpad I mean I'm not sure
that I'd want to use it to have write up
the script of my next big Hollywood
blockbuster but let's face it if I was
working on stuff like that on a regular
basis I would have more than $200 for my
laptop usability wise I can live with
the single tasking paradigm enabled by
the two core Celeron processor for the
most part and I'd say the screen is the
biggest bummer colors are pretty flat
viewing angles aren't great and it
doesn't get bright enough for use
outside but if you plan on watching
YouTube videos or Netflix it'll be good
enough and I wouldn't go as far as to
say it's actually terrible like other
cheap screens I've seen before the only
true disappointment came when we opened
it up I was hoping that it would be
possible to add a hard drive or SSD in
the future and upgrade the RAM but
they're both soldered to the motherboard
with no expansion slots so I guess in a
nutshell the best thing about this
product is that there's nothing so bad
as to make it a total deal-breaker and
at $200 occasionally on sale for 150
that's all I can really ask for I
really recommended as a secondary
computer if you spent all your money on
a desktop this will work great when you
need to go out into the real world god
forbid but it still scrapes by with a
recommendation so why doesn't it's $400
cousin get the same treatment reason
number two the Inspiron p25 T is pretty
much more of the same and sits right
around the amount of money that lots of
people think they want to spend on a
laptop but our problem is that we don't
feel like they're getting twice the
experience for something that costs
twice as much upgrades on this guy
include a 500 gig hard drive double the
RAM a two-in-one capable touchscreen and
a slightly better processor the issue
though is that the 5400 rpm hard drive
is slow as molasses and I mean maybe
this is Microsoft's fault but Windows 10
chugs on a mechanical drive simple stuff
like switching modes hitting the Start
menu opening files are really anything
is just such a slog plus with almost
everything done on the internet now the
need for large amounts of local storage
is becoming very limited except in
gaming rigs workstations or desktop
computers with a large amount of storage
because you put all your stuff on them
so when you consider that the biggest
problem is that we still need a primary
computer just like the $200 laptop but
without the practically disposable price
tag to make it more palatable I mean to
be clear tablet conversion and touch
will be important to some folks and the
performance is better but performance is
better in a way that's only really
noticeable if you compare them
side-by-side like you're still buying
the type of computer where you type in a
web address and then you take a sip of
coffee while it loads so what do we
then for someone who's on a budget but
with more than 200 dollars to spend
reason number three for not buying this
the Inspiron p69 G I mean sure this
isn't the be-all and end-all of $800
laptops but it represents the kind of
improvements in productivity that you
can get by increasing your budget to the
bang for the buck level everything gets
an upgrade with a core i5 processor
eight gigs of ram decent i/o including
HDMI and USB 3 and SSD and a full HD IPS
touch display it checks all the boxes
that I would consider for a computer
that I would actually recommend to
somebody that I like provided they don't
need faster than one by one Wi-Fi I do
realize that $800 is a big jump from
$400 but these can regularly be found
for under 700 and functionally speaking
it's not even in the same ballpark as
the other two it's not startlingly fast
sure but I never got annoyed at it you
don't have to worry about running out of
RAM just from opening a few tabs and the
processor is fast enough for some
programming work some basic image
editing MATLAB or even some light cat if
you want to view small assemblies this
kind of stuff is simply not possible on
the cheaper laptops so for this one then
the outside is simple but the keyboard
is satisfying enough that this whole
review was typed on it without annoyance
the brushed plastic finish looks pretty
smart and chassis rigidity is overall
very good though
I think the wobble on the two-in-one
convertible touchscreen could be better
and this model isn't available without
it
at the end of the day though the choice
is yours battery life was decent across
the board seems that problem has pretty
much been solved with low-end laptops
the webcams on all three were comparable
and surprisingly good although Windows
hello on the $800 model is a really nice
touch and all of them feature speakers
that are comparable to a decent
smartphone so not that great wrapping
this up though honestly
I don't really have a special
relationship with any of these exact
models from Dell and the main goal of
this video was to hopefully help you
narrow down your search in terms of
pricing and the features that we think
matter when you're looking for a
secondary laptop or a back-to-school
machine so you don't want to spend too
much but you also don't want to spend
too little but then also spending even
less might be even better than that
Optima is one of those brands that
unless you've been seriously shopping
for a high-end projector you might not
have ever encountered but they're worth
encountering now if you're looking for a
high quality projector at $2,000 the
Optima UHD 60 is not especially cheap
but what it is is an incredible value up
until now
4k projectors have been much more
expensive and the UHD 60 features an
abundance of image quality technologies
including high dynamic range
compatibility for enhanced color and
black-and-whites dynamic black for
amazing contrast and ultra detail for a
clear crisp picture basically in a
nutshell it's got stunning picture
quality for movies sports and gaming
with great color black levels clarity
and detail pretty much no matter how big
your screen is as to risk it actually
does matter how big your screen is so
bottom line it's a great bang for the
buck with one of the best pictures
available today lots of features
including lens shift which makes
installation super a lot easier and it's
the best price per inch compared to any
other 4k product TV or projector check
