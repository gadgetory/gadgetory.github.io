right so today we have the rampage -
extreme motherboard from Essos and the
features of this board as outlined by
the back of the box our support for
Intel's new Nehalem core i7 CPUs up to
12 gigabytes of ddr3 memory and
triple-channel
yeah whatever if you wanted to look up
the specs you could look online so
basically we're going to talk a little
bit about the slot layout basically one
of this board has one of the best
regarded slot layouts out of all the x58
boards you can put in one two and just
to prove that I can count three video
cards a try video card configuration it
supports both tri sli and tri crossfire
and you still will have one PCI Express
slot way up at the top for the onboard
supreme FX sound there you go that's
what the back of your system will look
like if you are unlike me and you've
managed to plug in three different video
cards in a sound card included with the
rampage 2 extreme is the the usual
suspects as far as accessories goes
cables adapters all that kind of stuff
but it does come with some cool stuff
there's the LCD poster which will
basically tell you on an LCD if the
system posted or not and why these are
really cool
these are probe it is what it as soos is
calling it but essentially it hooks up
to any one of these contacts on the side
of the board and you can use your
digital multimeter to find out the exact
voltage is being fed to components these
are some temp probes and then this is
kind of cool you've got a flexible SLI
bridge so that means that you can either
use the two slots that are closer to
each other for SLI or the two that are
further apart that means that you can
decide whether you want an extra PCI
Express or an extra PCI slot as your
extra and then there's also the new
supreme FX X Phi Edition it seems like
they'll put an X file o go on pretty
much anything these days and your i/o
panel and that's about all for
interesting accessories
