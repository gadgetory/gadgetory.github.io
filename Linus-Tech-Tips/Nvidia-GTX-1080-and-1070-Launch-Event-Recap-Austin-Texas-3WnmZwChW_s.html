launched the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 early
enough that they would give people time
to hype up before Computex they told us
nothing about this trip beforehand I
knew nothing on my way down
so the first thing they did was bring us
to a ranch a massive gorgeous 30 acre
ranch they had tons of cool stuff there
like ATV rides riding horses going
fishing kayaking skeet shooting
tons of stuff it was fantastic but it
still didn't have anything to do with
graphics cards so I interviewed a horse
and asked him what he thought about the
GTX 1080 so Marvin what kind of like how
many transistors do you think it's gonna
have about like CUDA cores memory speed
memory bandwidth okay what do you think
about like the overall like kind of
Batmobile aesthetic that we saw leaked
on the Nvidia website interesting I
think Marvin actually might have better
insights than some of the reviewers here
now that is one smart horse as me if
you've seen the last dream if you know
the specs of this card you know that
he's pretty damn accurate but let's
compare his accuracy to other various
tech reviewers in the space and see what
they expected from the GTX 1080 all
right Jay what are your predictions for
the GTX 1080
well firstly I'd like to welcome you to
my stage I think the GX 1080
I don't know what to expect but I think
obviously it's meant for 1080p gaming
I mean clearly it's in the name right so
for all of you 4k uhd enthusiasts we'll
get you next time
desert here a lovely dessert first off
it's provided by a video so there's
obviously formation right there
second we're expecting to move Pascal
technology including Co WLS can you pick
any call that's kailash i don't know how
to pronounce that dish chip on wafer on
substrate you can see the layers of this
cake the striations in there that's
obviously representing that and then you
have this which is just chocolate well
they're dropping a lot of hints here
this life vest is sort of a
representative of the market marketing
hype you better be ready yeah for this
raging river that's coming yeah and then
we've got this river over here it's
about knee-deep which is about
indicative of the performance increase I
expect all right Anthony what
predictions do you have for the GTX
1080i next performance with a small
package less power a good cross pass now
of course I would expect gddr5 or 5x I
don't think HBM 2 will be on this but
yet yields not there yet yeah that's
really the main part of my projections
right now right now so what do you
expect from the GTX 1080 in the real
question Luke
1080 expect for me what do most people
inspect me these days ball okay so as
you can probably tell enthusiasm wasn't
super high most people were kind of
making jokes and not expecting a massive
amount they're expecting something good
but not something groundbreaking and
then the event was actually kind of
impressive so I gathered some guys came
back to the hotel room and we had a
discussion about it the discussion was
almost an hour long so a lot of its
gonna be cut out but here's here's some
highlights well I think usually when
you're talking about a new launch you're
looking at maybe Intel's gotten us to
use to expecting a 10 to 15 percent of
performance boost Pergamum awkward yeah
so the numbers at least that we're
seeing from Nvidia as far as performance
compared to last generation
specifically like Titan X I mean it's
insane
the fact that you could get a 1070 for
300 and how much is it 3 339 379 it's
better than a Titan X right now I mean
that's that's reference 1070 it's better
than oh there's gonna be board partner
versions yeah I was most shocked at the
fact that see you and I in speculated
like what are they gonna compare it to
your they're gonna benchmark against 680
or they gonna maybe 79 I thought at the
most it would be seven eight they came
right on the shoot with the 980 and then
went there and said it's faster than
tight next yeah
they literally obsoleted their current
offerings entirely 80s in that's a lie
that was crazy that was nuts when I put
that on you do have to remember that
their charts are a little bit cherry
picked so maybe they would do things
like it was faster but then the x axis
is wattage yeah and then in like this
one it's like strictly PR VR performance
they never talked very specifically
about like the GMT I resolve yeah they
didn't talk about DX in the slightest we
talked to them afterwards right and they
said a 25% bump
compared to 1980 I in tight next 2560
CUDA cores easy to remember it's my 560
pay this is all
yeah this is for the 10 80s we don't
have these specs we 1070 1607 megahertz
base clock that gives you 8.2 teraflops
at base 17 33 megahertz boost clocking
for 8.9 teraflops 320 gigabytes per
second is the memory is the memory
throughput 256 bit 8 gigabytes of gddr5
X + 180 watt listed power with a single
8 pin connected that's the most
impressive ultimate like how they're
able to go from having this call that
uses so much power like a like a tiny
it's hot and it's loud yeah and it can
use a lot of power but it's it's really
fun thank God that's what's single yeah
okay that's just
well I choked and we tweeted during the
event you know that I personally I don't
care about power consumption give me all
the FPS I'm okay with a power hog but
this is my this might be the first time
room I'm actually excited about the TDP
reduction because I obviously with three
type X's under water loop and massive
radiators I still do with a lot of heat
and any any amount of heat that I can
reduce now it's only bonus yeah you said
during the event like when they're doing
that whatever demo that was where they
were just spinning around the guy and
that was only right 67 degrees yeah yeah
when they write up a precision X overlay
yeah it showed 2114 megahertz which we
are we are kind of speculating that's
gonna be like founders edition yeah the
founder curve but it's and memory was
overclocked to eleven hundred and
sixteen yeah effective 11 eleven
thousand sorry eleven thousand thousand
sixteen acres for the ddr4 like just
considering potential overclocks
or found whatever the founders like we
don't know yet either
we don't know if what we're shown as a
founders edition yet we're speculating
it because of how far percentage-wise
that is
so much Headroom like sixteen to
seventeen hundred megahertz base and
loose but up to over 2,000 and this is
fairly early I thought I was like we're
talking about for what they've shown us
we don't know if that's if the founders
edition has
to type in characters what haven't said
anything regardless the temperature
shown was 67 C so unless they had this
thing with like some sort of an air
conditioner blowing directly on it you
know what the f is up with that
temperature in that overclock yeah I'm
like we're in Texas
I'm super sunburned like that Wow okay
that's pretty good
what do you guys think aesthetically
over the car because going into this the
the photos that we saw from the like
whatever factory that a leaked from and
then the leak they had the leak they had
booked a dead weight super aggressive
yeah like I thought there's gonna be
massive cut in chunks and stuff right
it's actually somewhat subtle he's a lot
less transformers like yeah they looked
like I was a waiting for that to like
just transform but it looks why cleanup
I feel like Liam I feel like I would
have liked to have seen a more radical
color design change since it's such a
radical new new innovation for them in
terms of 60 nanometers you know I think
we've kind of the cooler I'm
disappointed I like the new angles and
stuff hopefully maybe that I lost some
more air to get in there for reference
style multi you know GPU cafes but I
don't know we've seen the same cooler
now for like four years alright guys
hopefully you enjoyed that it is 3:30 in
the morning I haven't even started
editing this yet and I have to wake up
at 6 how is that gonna work I'm probably
not gonna sleep anyways I'm gonna
release another video tomorrow with
probably more in depth like hands-on
stuff about the different technologies
and stuff that they talked about
hopefully I can get more information on
the founders edition cuz what the hell's
going on there anyways guys stay tuned
check out tomorrow's make sure you're
subscribed hit the like button if this
was awesome hit that dislike button if
you're like screw you this video sucks
go to sleep
that would be fair use our Amazon
affiliate code buy a cool shirt become a
member of the forum you guys know I'm
editing this and then I'm going a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
