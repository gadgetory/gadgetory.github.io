Banshee I've received a ton of requests
to unbox this particular gaming headset
this is part of their Starcraft 2
branded line of products thus there's
something about calling down the Thunder
which is good I suppose when you have a
headset thunder would mean bass I guess
okay
so let's have a look at what Razer has
to say for themselves about the features
on the back of the box and as always
razors boxes are excellent and this one
is no exception looks outstanding
alright here we go so you've got eight
preset EQ settings we've got a PM
lighting system which means the more
actions per minute the lights change so
that's pretty neat we have a circumaural
design which just means that they sit
around your ears and we have a braided
fiber cable which is pretty typical for
high-end gaming headsets these days you
can control your mic using this here you
can use okay extended comfort
circumaural design okay that we've
covered already you got volume control
APM lighting system true-to-life gaming
audio which is to be expected for me
true to life gaming headset detachable
microphone boom as well as a seven-foot
lightweight non tangle cord alright I
think that's pretty much this is just
the same stuff again and it is a USB
headset so that's something that I was
not aware of looking at the product
initially so what that means is that you
won't be reliant on the performance of
your sound card in order to get the best
possible performance out of the banshee
so the whole USB headset thing is a bit
of a double-edged sword because if you
do have a great sound card then you're
probably not doing yourself a favor
using the USB sound card that's
integrated with it but if you don't like
if you're gaming on a laptop then it is
a huge advantage versus using a lower
quality onboard sound system so here we
go we've got the product itself we've
got some accessories here comes in kind
of a neat shaped box which has this in
it that's it they
accessories so we've got a quick start
guide some laser stickers a master guide
that's it that's it that's that's easy
alright now we take the front of the
packaging off we can get out our tangle
free cord here and now we have removed
the Banshee headset from its packaging
so the first thing I like to do with any
headset product is put it on see how it
feels okay so what stands out to me
about this right off the bat is the fact
that it is not only circumaural it is
circumaural even if you've got huge ears
so this should be comfortable and not
press on the top of your ears
even if you have big ears so you know
what what you're seeing here isn't even
the full extent of the space inside
because you can see even in here so if
the talk of your year like right around
here is is up in that pocket then it's
gonna be quite comfortable so even
wearing my earrings I I don't notice any
any discomfort from this particular
headset it is a little on the heavy side
although part of that could be the fact
that I do have the 7 foot cord hanging
off of it right now
there's the gold plated USB connection
remember gold plating doesn't help the
performance but what it does help is the
longevity you'll always have a good
connection because gold does allow you
to have a better more clean contact
surface due to its anti corrosion
properties so that's a good thing about
gold so let's go through the headset and
have a look at what we've got in terms
of controls on this guy so first things
first let's attach the optional blue mic
and figure out where it even attaches
here okay so on this side we take off
that rubber stopper which now fell and
we can go ahead and plug in our boom mic
which can be pushed up to the top or it
can be pushed down to the bottom it can
actually go almost all the way around so
that looks like about 270 degrees so I
wouldn't recommend using it facing this
way because then your left channel is
going to be in your
and you're right channels gonna be in
your left ear and that's not really
ideal for gaming especially if you want
decent directionality but there that is
how it is generally intended to be used
you can adjust the positioning of it a
little bit so it can sit further or
closer to your mouth all right and let's
have a look at what we've got in terms
of controls on here so we've got lights
here lights here lights here lots of
lights all over this headset so you'll
definitely look pretty cool at whatever
LAN you're at playing with your headset
and then you got mic volume that's a
really cool feature so your mic volume
can be adjusted here or muted using the
buttons behind your left ear then your
headphone volume can be adjusted here or
muted using the buttons behind your
right ear so personally I find that to
be a very cool feature most headsets
don't have mic volume control they only
have mute so this way you have a quick
way if you're in game you don't have to
alt tab out go to mumble live and trillo
or whatever you're using adjust your mic
settings no you can just set it to
something relatively high and then
adjust as needed according to what the
other people who have to listen to you
are asking you to do so that's a pretty
neat little feature so let's just get a
couple shots of what the Banshee looks
like when it's installed on the user and
last but not least it is of course
adjustable so I just want to show you
guys the increments that it is
adjustable in nice firm clicks here and
when I extend it to its full size you
can see that it would fit ahead that's
quite a bit larger than my own without
any difficulty thanks for checking out
