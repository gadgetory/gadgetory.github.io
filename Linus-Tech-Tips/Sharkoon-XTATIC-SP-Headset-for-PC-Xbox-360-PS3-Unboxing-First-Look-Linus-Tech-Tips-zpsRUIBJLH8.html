ecstatic SP this is a stereo headset it
works on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 as well
as PC now this is not a straight headset
because it doesn't actually have a
microphone attached to it it uses us
built-in well matching but detachable
microphone so you can just use it as
headphones or you can attach the
microphone and use it as a headset it is
powered by USB and it has an inline
amplifier which makes perfect sense
because USB does provide enough power to
run a pair of headphones like this
without any difficulties so we're gonna
go ahead and open up the box here and
see what is inside with a gaming headset
and this is a gaming headset I mean it
says Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 right on
the front so it should be a fairly
self-explanatory with a gaming headset
in my perspective the biggest things are
comfort because a lot of the time it's I
mean it's fairly uncommon unless you're
a complete audio file to sit and listen
to music for you know three four hours
at a time but it's not all that uncommon
to get home from work and play your game
for three to four hours at a time so
anything that's going to be
uncomfortable you don't want to have any
part in so here we go let's see if we
can find any English on here that I can
meet no okay well basically it shows you
how to plug in a cable it's in color
which is outstanding and that's pretty
much it
here is the headset itself gonna take my
glasses off because I can't wear a
headset and glasses at the same time and
then I'm gonna figure out how exactly
this comes out of here
slightly challenging you accessories I
think we have accessories yes so let's
find out what's in there here we have
you know what give me a minute because I
think those instructions are more in
depth than just plugging the table
actually you know what don't give me a
minute just bear with me here and we'll
figure all of this out so here's
something here's something else oh you
know what I bet you okay actually I can
do minute I have figured it out I
figured out the accessories and here
we're having a look at the shark toon
headset here itself so you got like a
nice glossy finish on the sides
you've got adjustable an adjustable
headband on it you've got a nice sort of
a puffy pleather II this uh looks like a
very comfortable headband the ear pads
could probably be a little bit more
cushiony but I imagine like most
headsets once you break them in they
should be quite comfortable go ahead and
put them on while I explain everything
that comes with it so first of all here
is the camera man's getting distracted
by my charm and good looks in this
headset now he's making a face okay here
is the the controller so here you can
switch it between PC ps3 mode and Xbox
mode you can adjust your volume you can
mute your microphone or not mute it you
can adjust your voice transmit volume
and then there's the Xbox 360 adapter so
if you want to hook it up to Xbox 360
you plug this into the side you plug
this into your xbox controller then you
plug that's the point of an unboxing not
to look at the manual then you plug the
audio cable into here you plug this into
the back of your xbox you plug your
speaker's into the backs of these and
then you plug the USB into a USB port
and that provides power so there you go
so the audio signal
is completely unemployed and comes
through here and then you power the
built-in amplifier which is presumably
located inside here with the USB port
but you can still keep your speaker's
plugged in you just turn your headphones
off and then this is just a pass-through
so the signal will still go to your
speaker's or your TV even if you're not
using your headset now for ps3 it's
slightly simpler you basically don't
need this so you plug this in no that's
not it
you plug this in and the USB port and
then you are good to go all right
actually you probably need to use the
pass-through this is for PC and then
this is for power still now one more
piece that I haven't talked about yet is
the detachable mic you can see it uses a
very clever flexible design which is
look at this it's actually excellent
it's like infinitely adjustable and it
actually goes in in a fairly smart way
as well you can see it's not quite just
a round interface it has like a bit of a
lip on it so if you go ahead and plug it
in like that and then twist it not only
will it sit in the right position but it
won't come out no amount of throwing the
headset down in frustration will cause
the microphone to become detached so you
can position it exactly where you need
it like if you had a mouth on the side
of your neck then you could put it there
and if you don't then you could put it
in a more reasonable position like right
here and other than that you've got
adjustable ear cups so they go all the
way out just in case your head was sort
of like this but really what that's for
is just to give you good comfort no
matter what the shape of your head is
you can see it can be easily positioned
either way and then cameraman wants to
see the top of the headset for some
reason and last but not least you've got
a little clip here so you can secure it
to your shirt or your necktie thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
shark kun ecstatic USB powered headset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
