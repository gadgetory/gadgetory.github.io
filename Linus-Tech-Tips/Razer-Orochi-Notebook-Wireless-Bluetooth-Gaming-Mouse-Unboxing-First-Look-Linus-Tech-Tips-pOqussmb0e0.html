never really looked at before this is
the eraser Orochi or arrow key I'm not a
hundred percent sure how to pronounce
that so I'm not going to try and say it
again but this is a Bluetooth wireless
notebook Gaming Mouse so with gaining on
notebooks becoming so much more popular
as notebook gpus continue to make
progress towards the speed of their
equivalent desktop GPUs well there's
gotta be some demand for Gaming Mouse
because you can't game on a trackpad and
you certainly don't want a game on there
like you know jewel-encrusted you know
cheapo mice that you get at the big box
stores so Razer has determined that
there is a big enough neesh out there
for them to go ahead and produce a
notebook Gaming Mouse and if I can get
these packaging open that means I go a
long way towards getting this unboxing
on the road alright so here we go
notebook is a just a packaging master I
love the way they do their packages so
let's start with this one I mean
sometimes they're a little bit difficult
to get apart but they're certainly cool
so they've got their little for gamers
by gamers slogan Razer zone.com is their
website your unball okay
unbox this you open this welcome to the
cult of razer it includes a certificate
of authenticity for this particular
Mouse you've got a Quick Start Guide
which presumably will show you yeah how
to put batteries in how to sync it up
with the receiver how to switch to Wired
mode so that is both wired and wireless
much like the the Razer Mamba okay so
we've got a master guide so this is a
more detailed guide battery pairing
indicator behavior I've got some little
pictures in there shows you how to use
the driver software alright next we have
a other language and then we have a
master guide we'll hold on a minute
that's the difference between the master
guide PC oh this is the master guide for
Mac - showing you how to use the Mac
software very cool that's a lot of it's
a lot of manuals for a mouse next we
have a Razer sticker and as I recall
these are UV reactive but don't quote me
on that
okay then we have Lu little carrying
case very nice hey nice include some
batteries Energizer's and then also in
here it's a little okay a little like
separator thing so that stuff doesn't
get from one side of the carrying case
over on to the other side very nice then
we have the oh yeah the wired adapter so
that looks like a mini USB cable on that
side and that would be a larger USB
cable on that side alright let's see if
we can figure out how to get the most
out of the box its styled after the
Mamba box but not quite as not quite as
premium I mean the Mamba box was the
story is going around on the web where
that the the box for the Mamba was a
significant part of the of the price of
the mouse because it was so cool like it
made it look like the Mambo was floating
in the packaging yeah so it brought the
floating effect but it's not quite at
the same level this is a less expensive
product oh so that stands to reason
alright let's see if I can get this out
okay so gonna make another plastic
incision here there we are I think it's
gonna come out now yes success okay so
there's a couple little tabs here that I
believe are holding the mouse in don't
we just kind of okay Mouse came apart
while I was trying to take it out
oh that comes off really easily that's
good
there we go okay I finally managed to
slip it out so this is a very very small
Mouse which stands to reason as it is a
notebook Gaming Mouse so I'm gonna go
ahead and put that on my mouse pad here
so I have quite small ants I should say
that right from the start and I can use
this quite I'd say adequately
comfortably it's not something that I'd
want to necessarily be gaming on for
hours and hours and hours but as
something where you're just kind of
gaming on the go you want something
that's small enough to carry around I
can see this definitely being an option
so here is the switch on the bottom
which I'm sure if we had read the manual
we've note it does I think it has to do
with the pairing actually and then I
managed to get the cover off just a
second ago yeah that's really easy to
take off but not in a bad way because
when you're using the mouse obviously
you're not going to be putting pressure
on the on the bottom of the cover but
okay in terms of buttons we've got one
two back and forward or on the side here
and then we've actually got two more on
the other side so we've got a ton of
buttons on a tiny notebook most like
this our two main ones are most we all
click two on this side and two on the
other side so you just go ahead and lift
that up from the back and it's as simple
as that so you can put the batteries
inside it's got a little thing here so
that what you can do is once the
batteries are in the way to remove them
is to just pull on this tab you can lift
the batteries right out I love those
they've been around forever but still a
good thing to have included with any
product okay well I guess that's all
there really is for me to say about it
there we go we put the cover back on
it's that simple and here why don't we
just to you know do something else in
this video something different why don't
we use accessory so we're gonna go ahead
and put the mouse inside there and then
close it
haha so the mouse is installed and it's
a little carrying case very cute and
actually here why don't we show this too
so this is how to plug in the USB
interface if you do not want to use it
in Wireless mode you just plug that into
the sort of the bottom front bottom of
the mouse right there that's where the
USB interface is this goes in it's on
little sliding rails right there so you
can't put it in wrong just slide that on
apparently I'm putting it in wrong way
to go you just slide that in there and
then the Mouse looks like that you can
plug it directly into your notebook so
yeah if you have a gaming notebook this
would probably be a good addition to it
