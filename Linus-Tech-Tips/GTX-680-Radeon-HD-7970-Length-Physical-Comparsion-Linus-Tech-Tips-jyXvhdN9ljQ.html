videos for the Radeon HD 7970 and 7950
launches so I guess it's fitting that I
get around to it now basically what I'm
doing is my usual length and general
physical comparisons between these
various video cards so here the reasons
I've chosen these particular cards for
comparison or one the galaxy gtx 680 and
the Radeon HD 7970 are sort of the the
new kids on the block as far as high
performance goes with the GTX 680 being
the newest
of all the cards here the GTX 590 and
the Radeon HD 6990 are the last
generation king of the hill cards both
of them are dual GPU solutions that
performance similarly especially once
you overclock these these newer cards to
these newer single GPU cards so we're
gonna see what kind of in addition to
the much better power characteristics of
the 680 and the 7970 how much smaller
physically they are than their previous
generation brethren and the reason I'm
including the GTX 580 is due to the fact
that it it was a similarly positioned
card to the 680 from the last generation
so we want to see what improvements
Nvidia is made on comparing the last
generation single GPU to the current
generation the single GPU of hard so the
680 is exactly 10 inches long one of the
things I like about in videos reference
cards is that they don't unnecessarily
lengthen the card so you see how the PCB
ends here and the cooler ends here this
is something AMD just keeps doing and I
can't fathom why they do this but check
this out so the Radeon HD 7970
remember guys this information is
important if you need to fit one of
these cards in your case the 7970 is
about 11 inches long now what kills me
about that is you guys can see quite
clearly here actually I hope you can see
quite clearly here the PCB ends here so
they've just got extra random plastic
shroud about it looks like about a
quarter of an inch of it right off the
back of the card why
you doing that I had trouble fitting it
inside a shuttle XP C bare-bones due to
that extra just little tiny bit of space
I mean I did get it in so it wasn't the
end of the world but it's just a little
bit frustrating now in terms of the
other aspects of the layouts of these
cards these are both PCI Express 3.0
cards and they both have two power
connectors however the gtx 680 due to
its lower power consumption has two
6-pin power connectors in a unique
stacked configuration so in videos
theory about this is it will provide
slightly better cable management as well
as it buys as buy them more room on the
PCB you can see here that in theory it
uses up less space although you can yeah
I don't know how much I believe that
because you can also clearly see next to
the stacked configuration there are six
contact points from where we could have
put a 6 pin connector right here anyway
so yeah you know whatever but okay so in
theory it gives them that and I mean
maybe hey maybe it's working because
they do have a significantly shorter
card then the Radeon HD 7970 you can't
really tell this is sort of poorly
aligned in terms of the camera but these
are sitting at the same spot so this is
how much longer the 7970 is versus the
gtx 680 so it has an 8 pin and a 6 pin
now let's compare these to some last
generation cards so here we go you know
what let's focus on the 680 since it is
the newest card here how long is it
compared to a GTX 580 the 580 is
slightly longer not by much oops
oh sorry I'm having a little bit of
trouble with my chest tripod today here
guys there we go no I got it so at 10
and a half inches versus 10 inches there
aren't too many cases where that half an
inch is going to be the be-all and
end-all the the actual difference in
fact many cases are accepting graphics
cards up to 12 inches no problem these
days so it's something to be aware of
but if you have a gaming case like any
kind of decent case it's probably not
the end of the world
now the GTX 590 at 11 inches is one of
the longest graphics cards ever produced
you know for I guess you could call it
mainstream but it isn't really but for
for the general consumer
it's got to 8bim power connectors
compared to and this is a similarly
performing card especially in scenarios
like 3d vision we are definitely taking
a step in the right direction not to
mention the substantially improved power
consumption that we get with the GTX 680
and finally the longest pure consumer
card at a 1 foot long the radio in 69 90
so once again these are similarly
performing cards but if you want to talk
performance per inch the the 680 is
looking pretty good and for that matter
the 7970 looks pretty good too
especially once you start overclocking
it so to give you guys some context here
I've just brought along the motherboard
because yeah I can sort of measure these
in terms of inches but that really
doesn't help you eyeball whether they're
gonna fit in your case so let's take the
79 70 and the GTX 680 in my chest
tripods broken again here guys sorry
about the shaky camera alright so you
guys can visualize based on looking at
your motherboard where it sits in your
case and where the edge of your
motherboard is see that so the 680 hangs
just a little bit let's see how much it
is looks like about a quarter of an inch
little over a quarter of an inch over
the edge of your motherboard so as long
as you have that much clearance on the
side of the board then you should be
fine next we've got the 7970 which hangs
about an inch and a quarter over the
edge of a motherboard so they hopefully
that helps guys and don't forget to
