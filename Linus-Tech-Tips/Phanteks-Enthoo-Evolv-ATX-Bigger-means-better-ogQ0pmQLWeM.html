suite where we're checking out the enthu
evolved ATX in anthracite gray
anthrocytes apparently some coal thing
anyways thanks to msi for bringing us
here this year if you want to see all
the stuff they're releasing at Computex
check their bitly link in the
description down below also thank you to
linda.com sewing at the front of the
case you have an extremely
industrialized look and behind this
little panel which on the release unit
will actually stick up there it's just
this is a pre-production model so it is
a little bit floppy you have dual USB
3.0 microphone headphone and a reset
button which is ringed in an LED that
shows hard drive activity and down in
the lower part of the panel you have a
just solid white LED the power button is
actually up on the top which is
removable but is screwed in by standard
it doesn't just pop off like again some
of their previous models but if you want
to get into the top in a different way
if you just open the side panel you can
then remove two screws on the main
compartment side panel and three screws
on the back and then you can actually
just slide out where you'd mount those
fans and radiator if you noticed the
door isn't actually screwed on so it
just has some kind of pressure clamps
near the front which hold it in which
you pop out or pop in respectively and
then the hinges on the back can either
be unscrewed or you can just lift the
door up off the hinges if you do want to
remove it out of the way although I
expect most of you guys will just open
the door because that's quite easy for
the radiator in the front you can have
fans on the on the more forward side of
the grill and that they will stay out of
the way you can actually raise or lower
those depending on what compartment you
want to cool but I'll get to that in a
moment
if you want a bigger radiator you can
take this plate out now this plate you
can normally install a pump they have
they have cutouts for installing a pump
there but if you want a taller radiator
you can install the radiator there take
the plate out and then install the pump
down in the lower compartment which is
probably what I want to do anyways the
as you can see there's a bunch of fantex
plates just to the kind of left of where
those fans are and that is where you
would actually install additional hard
drives there's two standard hard drive
mounts for three-and-a-half inch drives
in the bottom but you can install up to
three more because of the sleds that you
have by default or up to one two three
four five more if you want to buy
additional sleds now back to that
basement
cover you have an SSD drive kind of
holding spot if you want to show it off
through the window on the front
right-hand side and there's a cable
management hole done for that and you
also have two more two and a half inch
drives locations behind the motherboard
now you might have noticed there wasn't
a sled for the one that's in the front
of the case that's because they give you
two sleds by default so you can decide
to have two in the back behind them on
the board or one behind the motherboard
and one in the front or however you want
but to be honest I usually just install
SSDs with tape or nothing anyways so you
can pretty much install as many SSDs you
want in this case and the another thing
about the basement is that there's a
cutout for the power supply a lot of
basements end up completely covering the
power supply which is nice because you
hide the cables but not nice because you
don't get to see the cool branding of
your badass power supply so now you'll
actually be able to see through the
window and see what power supply you own
right next to those hard drive mounts
are is also a place to mount a reservoir
and there's another reservoir mounting
space just beside where you would mount
any additional add-in cards that you
might have above that reservoir mounting
spot there's another 140 millimeter fan
by default which again you can slide up
and down so if you if you need to be a
little bit higher because you have an
air cooler for your CPU and you want it
to all be inline then that's cool if you
want to be lower because you want to
install a big freakin rad up there and
it goes that far back for whatever
reason then that's also cool no problem
big massive CPU cut out and a bunch of
grommets on the right hand side of the
motherboard and above the motherboard
with two cutouts without grommets above
the motherboard and three cutouts
without grommets just below the
motherboard for your like headers or
whatever else you might have installed
there before we go behind the
motherboard tray I would also like to
point out the bottom of the case which
also has a filter in it there's a filter
in the front of the case the bottom of
the case and the top of the case again
the top of the case it's mostly just a
solid plain metal panel with some a
little bit of breathing stuff on the
angled sides but that's also where your
power button is now behind the
motherboard tray most of this was
covered before but there are still a few
things those little feet for the power
supply that can keep it up and keep any
vibration noise away from it which is
actually quite cool there's the pump
mounting spot which I referenced earlier
there's the hard drive cages which I
referenced earlier there
the kind of like velcro we strap things
which are actually really nice and
commonly found on fantex cases and there
is a six fan pwm hub much like the front
the top spacing for fans can fit either
three by 120 millimeter or two by 140
millimeter and I really like how far
away from the motherboard tray they've
actually placed this cooling you can see
in the tray as I pull it out that
there's a bunch of spacing there that's
so you can fit a giant freaking radiator
and still have clearance over top of
your motherboard you might have troubles
if you install like massive Dominator
memory or whatever the heck but if you
install some fairly standard height
memory you'd be able to fit something
ridiculous like one of those alpha cool
monster rads alright guys let me know in
the comments down below is this the case
for you is this case you've been looking
for not quite yet or on twitter at luke
underscore LAF are also thanks to msi
