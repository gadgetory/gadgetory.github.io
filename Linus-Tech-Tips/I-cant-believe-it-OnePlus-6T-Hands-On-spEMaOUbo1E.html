their dog is into throwing big product
announcement events these days and today
it's one pluses turn in New York City
and they sponsored my trip out there to
check it out
thanks guys but you might have noticed
that instead of this video being thrown
together slapdash on the show floor I am
at home in Canada with my very own one
+62 unbox and show off
that's because oneplus had the good
sense to mail me one early so I could
take my time thank you smart people over
there so I'm gonna grab a coffee and
then have a look at what's new this is
one plus 16
one of the first things you'll notice
about the sixteen is that the matte
glass back has no fingerprint sensor
just a oneplus logo under the two lenses
that has the same hardware as last time
around with some software tweaks that is
because the sixty has one of the most
hotly anticipated features of the year
and under screen fingerprint sensor it's
really cool it's fast the little
animation makes it feel kind of
futuristic and I know I don't speak for
everyone but I've always preferred
fingerprint scanners on the front of the
device versus the back because I like
being able to use them even when they're
resting on the table and this
implementation lets you do just that and
that's without having a thick hardware
button equipped chin bar below the
screen oneplus also told me that my
preview of their oxygen OS doesn't have
it yet but if you continue to hold down
the scanner after the phone has been
unlocked they're adding a customizable
app shortcut bar that will pop up nice
so the under screen reader is pretty
sweet and closely related to the next
head-turning aspect of the 16 the knotch
or the not oh that's terrible but it's
justified because it's been considerably
shrunk down since last year increasing
the screen to body ratio more than two
percent and also making one pluses
approach among the least obtrusive
designs that I've seen despite still
packing in the front camera and the
three-in-one ambient light color
temperature and distance sensor making
matters even better in typical one class
fashion you do still have the option of
turning off the AMOLED pixels beside the
not and just pretending that it isn't
there though I mean by now so much of
the notification bar is preserved that I
actually can't say that I recommend
doing that anymore now I would still
prefer some kind of magic camera under
the screen or something like that maybe
that will come in the future but for the
time being
this approach makes way more sense to me
than the completely panoramic designs
that exist now like ah pose find X or
vivos and XS they're really slick but
the mechanical action that they rely on
to function smoothly in the long term is
still unproven at best especially after
the device has been you know dropped a
few times which well you know speaking
of dropping stuff also knew what the
sixteenth is Corning's next generation
Gorilla Glass six now Gorilla Glass 5
was designed to withstand one big sumo
braid drop from selfie height and we
actually saw one pluses internal
validation of these claims at their
factory earlier this year but the new
glass is meant to do that
plus withstand multiple smaller drops
surviving up to 15 drops from a height
of 1 meter in corning zone testing not
that everyone wants to take the risk so
fortunately there's a couple more safety
accessories in the box and I have to say
it's a pretty nice unboxing experience
overall the phone has a screen protector
pre applied and there's a transparent
condom type case then there's two items
you won't even find in the box of a
$1500 iPhone 10 as Mac's a fast charging
capable wall charger and a USB see two
three and a half millimeter audio dongle
honestly I'm not angry I'm just well I'm
just disappointed as all you were
supposed to be the chosen one the phone
for Android enthusiasts who don't have a
thousand bucks to spend on a pixel 3xl
first we had that little incident with
the wireless headphones and then found
these in your dresser drawer you're
making USB C headphones now on the
software side the 60 has the new oxygen
OS 9 based on Android Pi and as always
it is one of the best oh we an Android
implementations only deviating from
stock Android to give you meaningful
customizations I'm a really big fan of
their quick launch gestures like the
three finger screenshot oh yeah let's do
that one
look at that or drawing an O to launch
the camera or an M to launch maps or
whatever app it is that you setup and
what's really cool is that they make
even more sense now
because once you're eventually asked to
unlock the device boom your fingerprint
sensors right there you don't even have
to reposition your hand to hit it nice
bonus
so overall 60 is looking like a really
nice upgrade especially considering the
price there's still no formal IP water
resistance rating which I would have
liked to see but we get a 500 milliamp
hour battery capacity upgrade which
thanks to oxygen os's efficiency should
be a huge boost in actual usability we
get a slightly larger 6.4 inch display
increasing the pixel count ever so
slightly and taking the aspect ratio
from nineteen by nine to nineteen point
five by nine and we get six gigs of ram
with a hundred and twenty eight gigs of
storage on the base model now up from 64
gigs last time around and all of that is
for an extra twenty US dollars then on
the high-end model the RAM and storage
stay the same but for the first time
oneplus isn't shifting their pricing up
with the new generation so as long as
you're willing to bid farewell to your
collection of wired headphones there's
not much here to not like so thanks to
oneplus for sponsoring this video thanks
to you guys for watching if you disliked
this video you can hit that button but
