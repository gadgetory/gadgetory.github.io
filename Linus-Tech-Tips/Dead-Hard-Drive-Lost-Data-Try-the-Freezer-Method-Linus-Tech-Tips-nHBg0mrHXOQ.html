because we are about to undertake an
experiment which I have actually never
had the need to attempt before because I
do usually have all of my data backed up
in two separate places so this is a
Seagate free-agent go flex the line
boxed a while back this is a one
terabyte drive and what I normally use
it for is is a steam drive I just run it
off USB 3 or powered eSATA depending
what's on my test bench and then I keep
all my Steam games on it and I run steam
right off this drive so I don't have to
worry about reinstalling it and copying
files around all the time so that's fine
that's all fine and good because I keep
a backup of it on my home server with
all the Steam games so that's that's
done that's taken care what I didn't
have backed up when this drive decided
to die on me was a bunch of footage that
I had decided to move from my work PC to
home so I could archive it on my home
server so I have about a hundred gigs of
video files on here that I would really
like to get off so what happened is the
drive died on me and my cat is in the
garbage please don't thank you hey come
on okay so my drive decided to die on me
and I would really like to get that
footage it's not essential but it would
be great to have so we are going to be
hanged one we're going to be doing a
guide for resurrecting a dead drive so
the first thing is I'm going to unplug
the interface cable from it I'm going to
put it inside and as you static bag
the part is not actually like necessary
but it's not bad as a due diligence into
it so this particular drive the ziploc
freezer bag by the way this particular
drive the problem appears to be that
it's not spinning once it's got power
I can hear it making little noises
inside but the disc is not spin if the
drive spins it is quite unlikely that
this method will work so this drive
doesn't spin so we are going to try the
freezer method I'm going to freeze it
for a couple hours so it's ten o'clock
now I'm going to come back around
midnight and then I'm going to attempt
to
power it up and read the data Fitness
can sometimes recover drives for 20 to
30 minutes but other times it does not
work so I would love to be able to pull
my data off and I will let you guys know
how this goes a moment here okay put
that in the freezer there try to get
place to put it and I'll put it here on
the meat no I'm not gonna put it on the
me I'm gonna put it put the frozen peas
so hopefully it will cool down a little
faster here there we go
packed in there somewhat and I will be
back in two hours we'll attempt to get
some dad off my drive okay guys time for
the acid test it's uh well you can't
really see that but it's one o'clock in
the morning and I'm pretty tired but I
figured an extra hour probably not going
to hurt my chances here the drive feels
quite cold just in the kitchen right now
I'm gonna grab my interface cable back
upstairs close that editing upstairs
probably gonna find a cat or two on the
way there's one ah there's another one
looking at the mouse aquarium okay so
what we're going to do is we're going to
get on this computer here at some point
my camera will decide to focus we're
going to open up this drive together
this locked egg
I'm just going to leave it in the
anti-static bag I mean if there's
anything we can do to lessen the
likelihood of condensation forming on
the bag probably a good thing go ahead
and plug that interface cable in okay
whoops around to the side of the
computer here I'm going to plug that
into USB 3 in order to enable as high a
possible transmission speed here and
let's see if it gets detected so I
haven't pre-tested this or anything I
have no idea if this is going to work
free-agent no way oh no that's man I got
my hopes up but that's the restored one
from my home server so it looks like
it's not detected well that's a real
disappointment alright well thanks for
checking out this inquisitive episode of
Linus tech tips don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos one last update
the drive now appears to be detected I
pulled it out of the Bowflex housing and
it's now just a bear drive it's one
terabyte FreePlay as you can see it's a
thick two and a half inch drive however
if I go to the properties of the drive
and look for any volumes it would appear
that there are none so it's hooped
