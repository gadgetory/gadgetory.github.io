quick look at a product that I think is
probably the neatest most useful thing
that nobody has ever thought of for a
computer under like 25 bucks so this is
the NZXT iu0 one and you can have a look
at it here you can see that this has a
bunch of USB looking ports on it so
let's get this out of the box and I'll
tell you exactly what this thing does so
first of all we have a power adapter so
that's a molex connector right there you
got a pass-through and everything and
then there's a little power connector
that plugs into the custom PCB that goes
with this I got that okay the next thing
I have is a USB extension cable so this
is well not an extension cable pardon me
but a USB cable so this plugs into the
header on your motherboard you can see
it is USB 2.0 okay yeah you can't see
that that's okay
USB 2.0 and then the other end is
exactly the same thing okay and then you
have an instruction manual which seems
to be in a bunch of different languages
and I'm just gonna get it open here if I
can okay it's really simple actually
each one of these photos is exactly the
same photo just with a different
language under it connect the USB
connector to a spare internet it's pair
Internet USB connector on the
motherboard wow those are terrible
instructions well it shouldn't take you
long to figure out how to use this thing
it's really straightforward so then the
last thing we find inside is the little
module the little PCB itself so get this
out of here alright so I'll explain what
this does first of all you can see on
the back you've got a double sided
velcro attached you're thingamajiggy so
you just use that to attach it somewhere
inconspicuous in your case okay so you
need to provide power to this little PCB
right there okay and then you need to
plug in this cable right here like this
so ah there you go once you got it
hooked up you plug this into your
motherboard to an available USB header
and it expands that USB header to three
headers and two internal USB ports so
what you can use this for is for hooking
up anything that is not bare-bones for
function
for your computer so for example my case
has four front USB ports now most
motherboards only have two onboard
headers so that means if I wanted to
have say for example a card reader or an
M cubed T balancer fan controller which
I do have I would need an additional USB
header somewhere and so many of those of
those header devices don't seem to be
able to use an adapter to plug into one
of these and even then I mean what do
you want to do run it around to the back
of your case run a wire in through the K
like it like it's nasty it's not it's
not it's not elegant okay so basically
what you can do is you can take one port
you turn it into two you don't have to
worry about any additional power
consumption of those devices because the
PCB is powered so these are powered
ports now I wouldn't go using a bunch of
bandwidth sensitive devices and then
trying to use them all at once because
you are still going to be limited by
that one header worth of bandwidth but
that's not a huge concern the biggest
problem that you usually run into is hey
you want to plug in your Bluetooth USB
adapter your Wi-Fi adapter which you can
just hide internally now you don't even
have to use an expansion slot and you
can just mount one internally very
easily and then you want to have like
your fan controller with the you know
the readout on it or whatever it has and
then you want to have like a card reader
and then you use your two ports for your
four front USB ports then you win this
is a very cool product anyway I thought
it was definitely worth an unboxing and
a quick first look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
