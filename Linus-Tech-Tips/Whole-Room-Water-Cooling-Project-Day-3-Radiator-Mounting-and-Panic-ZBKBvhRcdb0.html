like walk braised leg a good way this is
Issa Sid this is Donna pull dispenser
from ton of iron Canada from the Merritt
Caturday you told us this is a whole
room water cooling project through my
practice looks is crazy typical - Media
Group's tile with the original plan
powering the fans on the radiators was
actually gonna be pretty straightforward
because they were gonna be relatively
close to the limit of opening but with
the new plan putting them down on a
little roof overhang getting power to
them was actually gonna be a bit of a
challenge so I came up with an idea we
were going to use part of the original
plan which was Swift tech eight port fan
splitters and then we were going to use
one of those handy little wall power to
4-pin molex connectors and mount it down
there in a way that it would be safe
from the weather and then silicone over
all the connections and all that so that
they don't corrode so we needed a new
plan and I came up with something that I
thought was gonna work we actually had
one of those like wall power 2 2 2 amp
12-volt power supplies and I was like
okay well it wasn't until the next
morning that I grabbed that adapter and
realized it's only 2 amps I wonder if
that's even going to be enough to power
all the fans so I ran inside check the
SPAC on the box for the fans and
realized that each fan is 0.1 amps that
means that with 20 fans on five
quadruple radiators we need exactly two
amps going through our splitters and out
to the fans
so my bacon got saved there it's just
barely enough
okay Luke's dad was here till 4:00 a.m.
getting all the copper piping installed
we got the radiator mount finished the
night before all the systems are pretty
much built they just need some more
quick disconnects so this is the day
that it all has to come together because
Nick Luke and Brandon are all leaving at
the end of the workday like there's no
stay late and they're going to pax to do
show coverage there so coming into the
office in the morning we set out some
goals okay we want to have the radiator
on the roof by noon we want to have the
room cleaned up and the desks rearranged
we need to run water through the copper
piping and get the soldering flux out of
there and we need to have all the
systems tubing connected by the end of
the day ready to show it off furgus so
one of my interview questions were how
do you feel about going up on the roof
which I didn't know I was doing so I
don't know as far as I had understood
considering it's on the fascia boards we
were putting a ladder against the side
of the house and I wasn't the one doing
it
those two things were pretty key even we
could even take the screen out of the
window probably just lean out and do it
that way but apparently we're going on
the roof so hopefully I'm able to check
in in a little while for now consider
I'll be hanging off the side of a roof
trying to install a radiator on fascia
board which makes no sense I have no
idea where the idea that Luke was going
on the roof came from he wouldn't even
be able to install the radiators from
there that's just to pick that's it
we're gonna use a ladder from the ground
I found out about this same time as
everyone else did I have a little bit
not really what it's for now got your
head oh hi maybe the water draining will
make it slightly lighter the radiator
assembly ended up being incredibly heavy
and there wasn't much we could do in
terms of pre installation because we
hadn't actually been up there yet before
we cut all of the wood and figured out
how we were going to mount it so I had
to go up the ladder first with building
materials like you know drill and
two-by-fours find somewhere to put those
which ended up being like a little lip
for for rainwater being redirected and
then I had to carry that entire radiator
set up up the ladder which was extremely
difficult I was actually on the top of
the ladder thinking that I was stuck for
quite a while because both of my hands
were on the radiator and I didn't have
enough leverage to bring it up onto the
roof without putting too much strain on
the ladder so that it would move to the
side and it was only by having someone
hold the ladder really securely at the
bottom and creeping my hand out I was
able to bring it up onto the roof
because it was enough on there that for
me to bring it down would have been a
huge momentum swing this way and for me
to bring it up would have moved the
ladder so it was I was pretty scary
getting it up there but once it was
there I was actually able to rest it on
the roof and aside from needing someone
to hand me tools from the window above
because I could I'd nowhere to store
everything it was pretty straight
forward from there keyboards huh
the next step is to secure this to that
oh my battery is uh it's no bueno
let's find out if my eyeballing work oh
yes it did we sent David for lumber um
and then I don't remember whose
suggestion it was but we realized that
having it mounted out there insects
could potentially be a huge problem so
we we sent him to go get some mesh that
we could glue on to the intake on the
radiator so that we could hopefully keep
bugs out of it now I in my wisdom
thinking that we had an entire roll of
this mesh used the mesh that I had
already cut to size to wipe off this
extremely goopy adhesives not realizing
that a that was all the mesh we had and
be home depot was out of stock that was
the last one that they had so when we
sent David back to the store to buy more
mesh they didn't even have any that was
an appropriate size and they're out of
stock for two weeks so I'm just gonna
join here I was like you want studfinder
he's like now I know it was a blank up
there I was like oh okay reader oh my
god I would I wouldn't be upset except
that it's exactly the same
exactly the same number of times is the
pump powerful enough I don't know you
tell me
that's so not so sure at this point kind
of sound chair I know
is one full is there any settings I know
all these
okay pronouncing that is not bad right
we're getting on Thea we were getting a
lot of bubbles are still getting a lot
of those ladies if this happens and you
have that much
Swift's tech was a great choice for us
for this project because they have some
of the parts that we need that are
pretty unique so they have all the quick
disconnect fittings that we need very
high quality they have the compression
fittings we need they have the water
blocks that we need they've got their
latest Apogee excel they also have their
Komodo NV l e which is what we're using
to liquid cool all the Titans and
finally this is really important they
have their radiator reservoir combo unit
that we're using to avoid installing one
additional component a reservoir inside
each of the systems so that will allow
us to detach the systems from the holder
in liquid cooling loop and then run them
on their own either if for some reason
we need to do maintenance on the loop or
if in the winter instead of removing the
heat from the room we want to kick the
heat from the systems into the room to
actually warm it up a little bit you can
put of a year how many custome and and
then this is going to go straight up
I'll cut it at some point clamp it to
the wall and then if there's an overflow
it will go up here and everything will
be okay instead of it fooling him
Oh
put it on then that's our calibrates
there okay cool I've literally always
guess not that look from - it's okay I
have to hang a painting of this wedding
for his wife put that down
I will it needs a cycle a better thing
yeah what no no water is just that like
it it's going now yeah did you just turn
the pump off no pump is still on for
sure okay good
get it some more water more water be
ready again okay okay okay
judging by how fast it goes out of that
fill tube like it's pushing okay are we
do we need to top up the tube one more
time I kind of come down or what's up we
can maybe give it a really short shot
okay water okay stop okay then I can are
you just talking cycling yeah Nancy let
me make it's it's pushing water
you just can't really tell with three
one wait are we out of water in the
filter yeah but if you like you know I'm
pretty sure there's still water in the
Reds okay
that is blue
I don't think my stuck in your bubble
stuff there's a lot of bubbles
let me help ya they stopped for a while
now they're starting again there's a lot
of a particular family there's adware
from the copper really yeah
what everyone part from the tea right by
the door on the hot hot side
let me pick some kinda supplies
all right dripping green - is there any
crease oh you rested it looks okay
blue be right there okay get the shirt
or something we can't just leave in you
where is the shirt in the
singing sorry
a serious
yeah I didn't see any solder
that was one of the last joints he did
so that was that like three thirty years
of me okay
yes not it oh oh I love it
it kind of feels like a movie in her
documentary yeah one of the one off the
Coolermaster Knapton 240m features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more
it
I never saw come
too much fun
crush and you through
so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
