more guys welcome to our product
overview of the omni by virtue X so this
is the world's first virtual reality set
up right now the only way that you can
actually use something like an oculus
standing up and not only that but it
enables movement while you are in games
in a way that's just never been done
before so I'm going to walk you through
what you actually need to get this going
step one is you're going to need some
kind of motion tracking device right now
this is an Xbox 360 Kinect but as you
can imagine there are other solutions
that could enable a world of other
possibilities such as well the new Xbox
one Kinect which is going to be higher
definition just generally better in
every possible way or even things like
accelerometers built into the device
itself the future no one knows but you
know wink wink
also you are going to need yourself a
computer sorry console gamers you guys
are going to have to man up and actually
invest in a gaming computer at this
point because let's just face it when it
comes to new ways of interacting with
our games PC is still number one now
we're here doing a product demo but I
actually haven't gotten a chance to try
it yet so I am taking yawns word for it
at this point but we are going to be
trying it and blogging about it before
we leave this hotel suite so yawn is
modeling for us his brainchild the Omni
so it starts with you need some kind of
virtual reality device in this case this
is an oculus development kit that he is
wearing so you can see it's attached by
a wire to the PC the oculus is unique in
that it uses a single screen and then an
optical splitter in order to bring
images to each eye right now the dev
kits aren't very high res which makes it
a little bit less immersive but by the
time the oculus rift hits us we're going
to be talking about a completely
different gaming experience now here's
the challenge this is the problem that
you'll unsolved here is that you can't
use an oculus standing up because what
happens is your body
it Orient's itself according to what you
see so if you're looking around in a
game world you will fall over trying to
use an oculus without this device so
let's work our way down so next we're
going to find this is relatively
unimportant right now but could be
different in the future this is just an
off-the-shelf plastic gun you being used
as a trigger this is an Xbox controller
and right now it is completely
unacceptable and totally just you know
whatever you could be easily holding
like you know a marshmallow that had a
button in it and that would work just as
well but in the future we could be
talking about separate tracking for the
camera and the gun in fact there's a
demo that valves got working right now
in collaboration with virtuix where you
can even do things like run down a path
down a corridor shooting behind you
with your gun because the tracking is
completely separate but right now this
demo that we're looking at today doesn't
have that alright next up what we've got
is the support device so this is where
the Omni really comes into it so now as
you can see this one right here is made
out of basically hand welded steel as
well as a couple of sort of also
handcrafted low friction pads so there's
two here and yon effect you just get you
to rotate a little bit for the audience
and right here so these interface with a
low friction ring around the support
device here and then it's all held on
with a supportive belt now what this
does is it keeps you from falling and it
also keeps you from being uncomfortable
or feeling strange while you stand in
the device there's two more pieces here
down below that make it so that when you
lean forward you don't have you don't
have any kind of a weird pressure on you
now these are all totally prototypes and
the finished design will be completely
different I mean it'll still support you
it won't be different in that it's like
a hen and lays eggs it'll be different
in that it's shaped differently so let's
move on to the actual omni itself this
supportive ring right now is made of
wood you know the old I well it's the
prototype is it made from wood screws
then the answer is yes and the finished
one will actually use a steel
endoskeleton inside the entire thing and
be made of molded plastic so it will be
much less heavy and it will also be a
more sleek looking but this ring right
here is what keeps you from falling is
also what supports your belt as you move
forward because the Omni actually allows
you to not only use virtual reality
standing up but also walk-in games or
even run in games which we've had demoed
for us already you can even alter your
movement speed this is going to change
the way that you interface with games so
the old way was the the only way to keep
a crosshair on someone was to strafe
around the league no one actually moves
like that this is going to change the
immersion because all of a sudden you'll
be able to look around a corner
boom boom boom look back and you won't
have to rely on weird cheap tricks like
you know QuickTime events to actually
move around and do the things that you
need to do so these arms are going to be
changed right now again they're made of
wood and this height adjustment thing
right here so for those of you who don't
happen to be exactly the same height as
Yann you know he didn't invent the thing
just for himself you'll be able to
change this around but it'll be more
like exercise equipment where a pin
drops out and you can adjust the height
depending on what you need to do the
platform down here is where things start
to get really really interesting because
a lot of design went into the curvature
here the materials being used so this is
the same low friction material that we
saw up at the top of the device and then
the shoes are really where some of the
magic starts to happen so I'm going to
get Yan to turn around for us so you can
see there's a gentle curve to the omni
itself and then there is a specially
designed shoe that right now looks like
a handmade moccasin don't worry the real
one will be different that uses three
contact points with a low friction
material here and a higher friction toe
so Yan can you show us how you walk on
the Omni and I'm just going to walk them
through the mechanics of it here so you
can see right here you want low friction
when you're on the curved surface but
what would happen if you had a high
friction toe on the shoe show us what
would happen Yan if you had high
friction toes on the shoe that's right
your feet would slip out from under you
so this is how okay sorry oh he's
running now you can't see we're not
pointing at you anymore but this is how
it keeps the feeling of walking from
feeling maybe not
quite like walking on even ground but
maybe more like a treadmill
now speaking of treadmills the
application of this given that the price
point is projected to be somewhere in
the I've seen 400 to 600 although this
guy's given me the neither will confirm
nor deny answer thanks a lot for that so
depending on what pricing looks like we
could be looking at something that is a
viable alternative for exercise gear for
gamers where not only do you get a more
immersive gaming experience but because
of the way that the software works so
there's special software that is
interpreting this as game movements and
as game actions because of the way that
it works we could be looking at a
situation where you can play games and
get exercise and not have the games be
just an exercise in sort of wiggling a
stick around or be limited to things
like you know follow along with the
dancer type Kinect games we could be
talking hardcore games that you can also
get a workout while doing you can
clearly see that yawn is a very fit
individual himself and I'm not sure how
comfortably felt modeling this for us
but either way I hope you guys have
enjoyed this showcase of the Omni by
