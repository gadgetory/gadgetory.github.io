sponsoring us here at Computex 2018
check out their 280x crystal series
cases at the link below well he's done
it again
the overclocking modding I don't know
it's hard to come up with a word for
this guy that doesn't sound a little
disrespectful cuz he's just kind of like
out there but in the best possible way
there Bauer has created something that
many have tried but no one has succeeded
at this my friends is a very early
stages prototype of a completely
pumpless all-in-one liquid cooling
system now the first time I ever saw
this attempted was in a post on Xtreme
systems by old OC Zed Tony where he was
like bat I was back when they released a
CPU block that I don't know if literally
anyone ever bought anyway they had kind
of gotten it working such that like the
evaporation of the boiling fluid in the
block got the the liquid to cycle
through the thing he was like yeah this
will probably never be a commercial
product and up until now he was right so
check this out let's let's come in here
and have a closer look now this is
obviously very early prototype stages
and there's gonna be a lot of changes
made Wow it's actually a little bit a
little bit toasty because there is a lot
of heat under this this is actually an
overclock to Intel 7900 X so even though
there's only two sticks in here no this
is not some like weak sauce KB like axis
is probably about 140 watts you figure
somewhere in that neighborhood so the
only reason that the other two DIMM
slots are occupied here is because
there's this like pressure sensor thing
sticking out of one side of it that will
not make it into the final product
although other than some kind of concept
stage renders of what the product might
look like we don't know too much about
it one thing that we know is that the
tubing probably won't end up looking
like this it'll be either one or two
tubes
hopefully two because that'll improve
the flexibility of the radiator
placement a little bit but there are
some special requirements that
unfortunately I'm not allowed to discuss
with you guys because he is being
completely zip lipped about what kind of
coolant he's using in here the reality
of it is is you can't keep something
like that that secret because there's
like material safety data sheets and
import and export laws and all that kind
of stuff so he has to keep as few people
as possible in the know like he didn't
invent a liquid here so as few people as
possible need to know so they can't
replicate it basically what we do know
is that the tubing won't be able to have
too deep of an s-curve in it because
then the condensing liquid that's
dripping back down towards the CPU will
get stuck we also know that the radiator
will have to be above the CPU because
that's the way that the coolant cycles
it's kind of like a heat pipe so you can
see here the CPU is actually visible
under there and then we've got some kind
of an element like a like a conductive
piece of metal that it's connected to
here and that is boiling whatever liquid
this is the gas Rises all the way up to
a very very again prototype stages
looking heat exchanger here where there
we go there's a better look at it where
we've got these kind of it looks like
it's C and C down like kind of a cnc'd
bottom piece here where it turns back
into a liquid and then drips back down
towards the CPU at the top and this will
also need some significant changes for
the final product we've got a couple of
what looks like server one you are these
just 1u server heat sinks Wow dinah tron
very nice couple of dinah tron copper
server heat sinks with 92 millimeter
fans on them but what we're going to end
up with in all likelihood is more of a
conventional radiator form factor and
with something like the same kind of fan
that you'd have on a rear exhaust blower
style GPU kind of scattering the air out
around it in terms of mounting hardware
we don't have too many details yet so
I'd love to hear from you guys in the
comments actually a couple of things
first of all I'd love to see if n
you can guess what coolant that is
because Roman is pretty confident over
here that no one is going to figure it
out and I'd love to hear from you guys
what kind of mounting hardware would you
like to see included this is very likely
to be a limited-edition product I'd be
surprised if they make more than like a
couple hundred of them personally
but it would be a very cool piece of
custom PC modding history to own because
this is another cool thing we've seen
concepts of this before and even though
there's no pump they end up kind of loud
because you can hear the coolant boiling
this one completely silent because of
the thickness of the enclosure here by
the way if you're looking for a case to
throw it in you might want to check out
Corsairs 280 x-series they've got a
couple of actually they've got four
different versions it's in black or
white and with or without our jeebies
it's an M ATX case design with multiple
cooling zones and it's kind of an
updated look of one of their older cases
with yes my friends do you guessed it
more RGB the RGB version includes two of
their Lite loop RGB fans as well as
their digital node controller which is
compatible with their new IQ software
you can learn more about the 280x
crystal series at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
you just like this video then like
you're on the wrong channel quite
frankly but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to yeah good luck you can't
buy it yet so let's put a link to like
like cat videos in the description I
don't know who cares just subscribe to
Linus tech tips so you don't miss any
more videos from Computex 2018 you can't
get away from the soil stare</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
