from our last guide but come on if you
want to do anything other than sit in
the dark playing cue op you're going to
need a hella wicked but bank account
friendly gaming mouse to go with it
right well turn out your pockets rip up
your seat cushions and scrape out those
cupholders because kids every gaming
mouse in this roundup costs less than
$15 synergy is the amazing software that
lets you share your mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers check it out
now at the link in the video description
first up at $9.99 we have the mouse
known only as South tech sporting the
cheap and glossy power rangers look just
totally in for spring 2017 but don't
judge a mouse by its grease magnet firm
the South tech has the highest Amazon
rating of any mouse in our roundup
boasting a max DPI of 3,200 higher than
the 2400 dpi of most of the competition
and it's the most symmetrical ensuring
apparently no fatigue even for a long
time use the scroll wheel is
unexceptional a little mushy feeling but
the moderate to heavy right and
left-click feel very similar indicating
at least some consistency in the switch
quality the breathing LEDs provide
visual feedback when stepping through
the 4 dpi presets and it even has a
quality control past sticker although
apparently you get one of these even if
your mouth shows up broken Souchak never
skimp from the included decals the habit
MF 672 from their magic eagle lineup is
the glowy espouse in the bunch with as
many as two colors shining at once
it's got a soft touch finish and
actually decent feeling build quality
from the heavier clicks to the
multicolored woven braided cord though
it should be noted the mouse wheel
appears to be a common problem
ergonomics wise if you've got the Donald
sized hands like me you'll probably feel
like you have to stretch to hit the side
buttons which just like the South tech
are programmed backwards for some reason
and I also couldn't help noticing that
the finger rests only really work at a
bizarre unnatural angle for my wrist and
that it's pretty hard to hold on to when
lifting it off the mat Jurgen Onix are
not a strong point for this one the
cheapest mouse in our roundup is the
Latin s xx which we got fur Wow $4.99 so
at this point it's gone up to $9.99 on
amazon.com and what $62 on Amazon dot ca
maybe that accounts for the effective
antioxidant and electromagnetic ring to
reduce radiation claims that they make
on the product page in all seriousness
though this one has an understated look
that we appreciated feels pretty good in
a claw grip with the textured plastic
sides and lightweight making liftoffs
easy and the medium weight clicks all
felt consistent and pretty good almost
letting us forgive the very short cord
and the lack of advertised gold plating
on the USB connector contact time to
kick it up a notch then with the EMR
combat your wing or as I like to call it
the cyborg can't 9 the most aggressive
looking and subjectively janky-ass Mouse
in the pile it's the heaviest wired
mouse thanks to its steel based
construction it claims to have 10
programmable buttons but if you don't
count scroll wheel up and down you get 9
and if you do it's 11
so anyway the default mapping is a bit
weird - I mean who would want to go
forward and back using these how do you
reach these no matter what you program
them to and on the subject of ergonomics
well it's a low arched Mouse targeting
users with smaller hands and it's got
these Springs to adjust the width of the
you know what just forget it it's what
it gains in style points it loses in
points points and mine came with a
broken right click so don't buy this
thing moving on the red dragon m6o one
central for us is shall we say inspired
by the msi interceptor and is the proud
winner of several awards in our roundup
here including best unboxing experience
longest cord and lowest weight or not
it's the only Mouse that came with
removable weights though I almost broke
my fingers trying to open the freaking
door it's comfortable the plastic feel
quality and it has a grippy finish on
the medium weight right and left click
that'll be nice while it lasts overall
this one came away with top marks during
our tests but your mileage may vary we
did find complaints online about short
connectivity hiccups every few minutes
onto the only Mouse without a braided
cable or any cable the eagletech ng 0:01
is a wireless gaming mouse for $13.99
it's got a high arch for large heads and
though all of our mice feature
toggleable DPI settings this is the only
one with dedicated buttons for up and
down it's got three side buttons which
are easy to reach and maps to control
alt and shift by default for some reason
that will need to be remapped with a
third-party tool methinks it's got a
battery saving non led mode and believe
it or not not only was it subjectively
the most comfortable Mouse in our
roundup it performs the best
in our counter-strike test with its
input leg not being noticeably worse
than any of our other mice here and two
meter per second maximum tracking speeds
being the best speaking of best the best
Lisette and 700 gaming mouse is a decent
all-rounder especially if you have
longer fingers with breathing LEDs that
cycle according to dpi or that can be
set to a solid color of your choice
including pink using the included
software it's got a simple base design
with a couple of flares a thumb and a
pinkie pad that helps things light
around and it's got these sort of dark
knight bearing things that could
probably poke your eye out it's
reasonably comfortable and every button
but the left click is programmable
unfortunately it was the only Mouse to
fail our glossy conference room table
test and as for the advertised weight
tuning system there's nothing built-in
so the expectation seems to be that
you're going to DIY it bringing us
finally to the highest resolution Mouse
in town
Zillo T's 550 DPI gaming mouse for pro
gamers aka the t-80 Big Mac I think
unexceptional summarizes this one pretty
well it's size makes it suitable for
medium to large hands it's got a
competitive gamer II look and a pinky
rest
mostly delivering on its promises of
built weight iron feel comfortable
mobile and stability and it also has
this nifty double click button but I'm
personally not convinced that moving my
finger over to click it is actually any
faster than simply clicking the medium
weight left click twice so which one
should you buy then let's get this out
of the way first if you're a low
sensitivity gamer none of them add our
resident csgo player gave every single
one of our mice a fail in the tracking
speed department with all but one of
them coming in at under 1.5 meters per
second maximum with that said he didn't
notice any obvious latency or accuracy
issues so they should be okay for casual
use in other games or for higher
sensitivity players so with that in mind
then the Eagle Tech Wireless works
pretty well and runs on standard
double-a batteries if you don't mind the
extra weight and the expense associated
with that if you like a simpler Mouse
the leten checks all the boxes for us
this was my personal favorite of all the
Wired choices and if you're looking for
something a little more aggressive
looking the red dragon is probably the
most bang for your buck just bear in
mind that with any of these choices you
might not get the same kind of longevity
that you might expect from a higher-end
gaming mouse from a respectable brand
synergy is an amazingly elegant solution
to the problem of having too many Chi
boards and mice on your desk do you for
some reason have more than one computer
maybe you need a different OS for a
development environment or maybe you've
got a laptop and a desktop whatever the
case may be with synergy you can use
just one keyboard and one Mouse and you
can actually share them effortlessly
between both or even more computers it's
supported on Windows Mac and even Linux
and they've got a couple of different
versions depending on all the features
you need and you can get stuff like
clipboard sharing between the computers
dragging and dropping files between them
the ability to set up hotkeys and more
