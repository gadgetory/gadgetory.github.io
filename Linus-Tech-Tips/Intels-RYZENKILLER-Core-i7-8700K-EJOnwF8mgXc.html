all like the cpu revering yep oh yeah
well you know what thanks for that and
while we're at it
thanks to tunnel bear tunnel bear makes

the core i7 8700 K and Core i5 8400 CPUs
that we're reviewing today our members
of Intel's eighth generation Core Series
codename Coffee Lake they're built on
the improved 14 nanometer plus plus
process and they fit in the same socket
as sixth and seventh gen processors but
for those of you rejoicing in the
streets that Intel is supporting the
same socket for three generations of
desktop chips for the first time in a
decade
think again neither 8th gen chips nor
the 300 series motherboards that go with
them are backwards compatible
trust us we tried Intel has an excuse
though at least for the new CPUs to not
work in the old boards because the new Z
370 chipset even though rumors indicate
that it's fundamentally a retooled z 270
supports higher speed ddr4 2666 out of
the box and offers improved power
delivery both things that required some
tweaks even to hardware and so I don't
know like maybe this is worth making a
video about like coaching people on how
to watch for this stuff because anyone
who was expecting a 200 series board to
get a CPU upgrade hasn't been following
Intel's pattern over the last 10 years
now AMD's announced long-term support of
a m4 might bring about a change in this
behavior from Intel but that remains to
be seen
AMD's history is - sure support a socket
for a long time but with CPUs that
nobody really wants to upgrade to with
all of that said I totally get why the
people who invested in bad cz 270 boards
are mad right now
architectural e coffee lake is more or
less just kb lake which itself was more
or less just sky lake no avx-512 no
rebalanced smartcash i mean
we're not even getting a new HD graphics
chip not that I cared about that
although hooray for hdcp 2.2 I guess so
that doesn't sound very compelling but
what is is that we are finally getting a
6 core Intel chip on the mainstream
platform and at mainstream prices but
there's more
it's not just a 6 core chip which is
kind of what I would have expected them
to do the entire core i7 and Core i5
lineup are getting the hex treatment
complete with additional cash and this
is all at roughly the same TDP as the
previous generation so if you're upset
about that then I'm glad because this is
a good thing we all used to get upset
about every new hardware generation but
it's ok salt can taste good you know
it's like oh oh
hmm like this is what it feels like when
oh that's awful ah oh oh why is this
even in here ok I'm sorry
so this this is what it feels like when
technology is actually advancing ah now
there are new core i3 s2 but those are
kind of boring and we didn't get samples
so let's get to performance of the chips
that we have we are going to be doing a
lot of testing this time around because
this is potentially a huge single
generation leap in performance so we
cracked open our previous generation
Intel rig our current gen Rison and
threw in core I 9 and thread Ripper for
good measure
so get your yeehaw ready cuz it's gonna
be one heck of a shootout and the core
i7 8700 K comes out guns blazing in our
1080p gaming tests it predictably trades
blows at the top of the
keep with its predecessor depending on
per game multi-threaded optimization I
curiously it seems to fare slightly
worse overall but it's nothing to cry
about more interesting is the core i5
8400 riding into town with 7700 K like
performance at an i5 price as for our 4k
gaming tests well these are some super
boring if beautiful and high resolution
graphs there's a reason that Anthony
coined the term the great equalizer for
4k in the core I 9 Extreme Edition video
everything performs the same when the
GPU is the bottleneck synthetic gaming
benchmarks tell a similar story
moving on to productivity oh boy the
core i7 8700 K kills it here easily
surpassing Rison in multi-threaded tests
and even approaching the core i9 lineup
thanks to its higher core clocks and it
even decisively snatches the
single-threaded crown from its
predecessor thanks to its higher turbo
and extra cash as for the core i5 8400
its lack of hyper threading does hurt it
here compared to its competitor the
Rison 5 1600 and since rise and chips
are unlocked that gap could widen with
overclocking Turnbull's are not that
great for the 8700 k although this seems
to be at least partially a firmware bug
since when overclocked we actually got
lower readings and power consumption is
higher than the last gen but nothing
like the h EDT and workstation chips
that we've been reviewing recently let's
talk overclocking it's pretty simple and
there's plenty of fine control including
per core overclocks at 5 gigahertz yes
my friends 5 gigahertz 6 cores we
managed a pretty decent improvement in
performance on our 8700 k giving it
similar Headroom to our 7700 k across
the board though as always your mileage
may vary bringing us to value
and it's here that coffee lake shines
when system cost has accounted for
compared to kb lake the core i7 8700 k
is on par for gaming that's good
but i don't for $100 less than that the
core i5 8400 is the one that's going to
be really disruptive be it for gamers or
entry-level content creators in
productivity the to actually switch
places
the 8700 k takes the crown here while
the 8400 sits in the back seat next to
risin over although both of the new
intel chips sit pretty at the top of the
pile so was coffee lake a last-minute
response to Rison in some respects
pricing not to mention the decision to
move the i5 line up to six core it might
be we don't know how good intel's
you know corporate espionage is you know
maybe the new Rison was gonna be good a
year and a half two years ago when they
would have had to start working on this
or maybe they didn't whatever was the
case this release is a major performance
win for the consumer and you know what
else is the win for the consumer joining
