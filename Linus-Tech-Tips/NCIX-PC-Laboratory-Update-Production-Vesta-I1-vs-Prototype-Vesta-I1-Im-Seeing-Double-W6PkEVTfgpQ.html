Russian laboratory so we've actually got
a production model of the Vesta I won
and I just wanted to sort of run you
guys through it in terms of the key
differences between the prototype model
the one here that was on display at the
NCIX tech fair and the actual production
model so the one off the tech fair I
already covered this has the vinyl blue
rainbowy stripey thing going on ok so we
have already said that the production
ones weren't going to come with that it
also has an under glowy thing going on
that isn't available yet but hopefully
will be coming at some point in the
future other than that except for the
hardware choices that the customer makes
they are the same dime thing so come
here and check this out you can see that
the carbon fiber vinyl wrap is actually
of exactly the same quality done by the
same shop with the same procedure as the
one that was in our you know special
golden sample unit you can see same
thing all the details are very well
detailed and then when it comes to the
internal cabling so the prototype was
built by the crazy Russian himself got
most care and attention because it's our
prototype and we do all of our marketing
based on that prototype unit all right
so there's that st. pretty tidy looks
pretty good looks pretty clean ok and
the production system was built by a
random one of our texts downstairs in
our production facility and you can see
once again pretty tight pretty clean
looks awesome so we're just showing you
guys the key difference between a
production system and a non-production
system which evidently is not a whole
lot so this particular customer has gone
with an asus directcu two graphics card
that's got their thick heat pipes on it
and they're this is actually a special
configuration where they're using an S
shape on the heat pipes in order to get
the best efficiency possible out of them
it should be a 678 so let us see that's
got to be a 670 ok so the L yeah they're
right on the back gtx670 he's also
decreased the ramp down to only eight
gigs of RAM or made potential
16 games around yep 16 gigs of ram and
then you can see the saber-tooth
placeholders are in there well their
place that is being held by those we've
got the corsair h100 in here everything
else is pretty much exactly what you'd
find in the e in the prototype system
except you know okay well no that's the
same sfd except he's added an optical
drive which you can see doesn't decrease
the sexiness factor of it and I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
about it you can see it's being burned
in for umpteen billion hours on prime 95
just because that's how the crazy
Russian rolls we want to make sure that
whatever happens with these sort of
letter number systems these are our
Premium premium systems so they do go
through extensive validation to make
sure that they are a hundred percent
ready to rock before they ship out and I
think that pretty much covers it so
thank you for checking out our little
showcase all of a fresh off the
production line ready to ship to a
customer that's the i 10 and also the
carbon fiber case is going to be
available in a couple other systems
including the g2 and the course they're
dream machines so if you do want one of
these carbon fiber cases and you don't
necessarily want the best I one you will
be able to get one hopefully very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
