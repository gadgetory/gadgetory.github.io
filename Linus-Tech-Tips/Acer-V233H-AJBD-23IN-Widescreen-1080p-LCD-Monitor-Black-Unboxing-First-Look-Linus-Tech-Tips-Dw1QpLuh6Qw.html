unboxing of the a cert V 2 3 3 H 8 jb d
this is a 23 inch widescreen monitor it
has 1080p resolution and it is a 16 by 9
monitor so that means that it is perfect
and even I would say ideal for watching
HD content on your computer because you
can run it completely on scales so at
full resolution and also if you have 16
by 9 content which could be the standard
then you will not be seeing any black
bars along the top and bottom of the
picture so let's have a look at the
accessories that are included with it
this is a pretty value-oriented monitor
but it still comes with a fair number of
accessories so you've got both of your
cables included VGA as well as DVI VGA
DVI cables then you've also got a power
cable this monitor has an internal
inverter so that means that you do not
have to have an external power brick
with it next we've actually there that
was it you've just got the monitor
itself so I'm just gonna turn this over
and dump it out it is compatible with
Windows 7 according to the box right now
ok so the box comes down here the base
goes here it has a very simple base so
it doesn't feature swivel or tilt or any
of those fancy features but what it does
have is solidity going for it like I
said it's a fairly basic monitor but the
reality of it is if you're looking for
sort of a high resolution reasonably big
screen it's a 23 inch then this is
probably pretty much what you're looking
for so let's just open this up here and
then we've got a little cover over top
of the screen so I'm just gonna sorry
I'm just bear with me here while I
remove this and then we'll put this
monitor together and I'm actually
unboxing this so that I can do a bit of
a comparison between a conventional
cathode backlit LCD and an LED backlit
LCD so Aaron let me just throw this on
here and the first thing that we're
gonna look at in our
Harrison is going to be the width
because of that is one of the coolest
things about LED backlight technology so
check this out okay so yes it does have
tilt actually I take that back it has
tilt in fact they both have tilt okay so
there you go that is how much thinner
and LED backlit display is because
instead of having these big tube lights
in the back here it's actually just got
individual LEDs cameraman wants to have
like sort of a better look at it oh yeah
I see I see what you want to do that
okay so anyway that's it for my
comparison you'll have to watch the full
NCIX tech tips episode but we're gonna
look at sort of power consumption as
well as the differences in contrast
ratio color reproduction as well as
thickness obviously here is where all of
our on-screen controls are so you got
menu auto adjust navigating the menus as
well as your power button and that
pretty much covers the cameraman wants
me to turn it around yeah because that
don't totally doesn't cover it so here
at the back we've got ventilation
because those lights you get quite hot
that's yet another thing that you do not
find on the back of an LED backlit LCD
we have four screws for our VESA mount
so if you wanted to mount this to
something like actually this would be a
perfect thing to mount on that cool ITX
case that I unboxed a while back where
it's got a little arm coming out of the
top of the case and you just mount a
monitor on it so that'd be a perfect use
for something like this here's your
power in as well as your DVI and VGA
inputs it does have a Kensington lock
port here so if you have security
concerns about where this monitor is
going to be placed then that would be a
good way to secure it thank you for
checking out my unboxing today and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
as well as my NCIX comm channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
