sponsor a piece featuring their new
honor 6x smartphone so they send it over
and sitting there bored at a family
function putting the gears to the
phone's dual lens camera Chiron 665
octa-core CPU four gigs of RAM and 33 40
milliamp hour battery and on my in-laws
house right and an argument breaks out
at the Scrabble table and meanwhile I'm
testing they're going why don't you just
google it but it's not all bad thanks to
my entire evening of eye rolling face
palming and full-body cringing we all
get to experience this fantastic video
eight of the worst ways the older
generation makes my head explode brought
to you by the honor 6x number one my dad
seems completely unable to wrap his head
around the fact that making phone calls
ain't what it used to be
he still it is 2017 he still tries to
crank call me quit Coleman
like I'll answer my phone and he'll
start pretending to order of pizza or
I'll call him and he'll answer with some
goofy accent trying to convince me that
I got the wrong number
dude I know it's you I've had caller ID
on my phone since I was in high school
and I know I didn't miss dial your
number
nobody dials numbers anymore remember -
I needed to get to my grandma's new
place so I even proactively like I'm
ready for this
I proactively structure the question
like so hey can you give me your new
address grand and to my dismay she like
every other old person on the planet
proceeds to launch into this elaborate
play-by-play of the route
don't go past the giant tiger then left
at the spoon shaped rock and you'll see
this really friendly young man water in
the grass well well that's Chester the
neighbor's son in Locksley and he works
at the co-op okay this is not a quest
grandma I'm not retaining any of this
I'm not listening please for the love of
all that is good
tell me the address so I can open my
Maps app and key it in number three
thanks to simple interfaces like honors
emotion UI smartphones are getting
easier and easier to use but just
because an older person learns to use
the internet doesn't mean they really
get how to internet and we've all
suffered the consequences of this one so
here's a few etiquette tips if I don't
copy paste your status update you posted
it doesn't mean I'm not your true
friends that funny chain letter well if
the memes have Ebaum's world watermarks
they're probably a little dated and
auntie thank you so much for the urgent
cybersecurity advisory telling me to
beware of people calling and pretending
they work for Microsoft I know your
hearts in the right place but please
just
oh please number four why is it that
every time I go somewhere with my dad
he's always trying to get me to memorize
what section of the parking garage Rin
so that we don't lose the car okay
what's the color orange okay what's the
number a shoot I forget let's go back
look I'm Way ahead of your dad
just take a picture and move on it
doesn't consume film anymore
and we don't have to wait for it to get
developed number five you convinced your
mother-in-law to get a cell phone but
she refuses to get cellular data because
it's expensive and Lisa needs braces
well you know what I have to say that
but data plan it's like $10 a month less
on pink and you know what else is
expensive getting lost two blocks from
your grandson's birthday party and
spending 15 minutes on the phone with me
trying to figure out where the heck you
are which way is west
and which auto record to drive towards
to get back on the right path you aren't
even supposed to be on the phone when
you're driving number 6 my dad knows how
to text me he even sent this in messages
and pictures over hangouts but he
doesn't seem to grasp the added utility
that leave modern mediums have over
snail mail so every three to five days
he sends me an epic wall of text with
where he's staying the recent weather
best wishes for the kids and then he
signs his name at the bottom and I'm
like pops it's instant messaging I can
replied it right away you can reply
right away and we can have a
conversation do your relatives ever send
you snail mail and then text you to tell
you to expect it and why did you number
seven my auntie still brings her digital
point-and-shoot that runs on double-a
batteries to family functions even
though the camera on her phone is way
better way easier to use and easy to
share pictures with it just seems like
it's hard for some older people to
internalize just how many single-use
devices modern phones have replaced I
mean what's next a calculator at the
restaurant to split the bill
damn it Verne there is an app for that
and finally number eight right next to
the landline phone at my grandparents
house it's a wall power adapter for the
cell phone that lives in the wall with
the phone next to it plugged in 100% of
the time when they're at home sometimes
I even see them scan their
while they're talking on it do you
realize that modern phones like this one
can last for like two days before they
die why not just plug it in when you go
to bed well that way I always know where
it is you don't go anywhere Lin just
keep it in your pocket and that way
you'll know where it is and you'll
actually be safer in the event of a
nasty fall or a freak accident with a
knitting needle or whatever so thanks to
honor for sponsoring this list of ways
that people are bound to misuse their
awesome technology you can check out the
link to where to buy the honor 6x in the
