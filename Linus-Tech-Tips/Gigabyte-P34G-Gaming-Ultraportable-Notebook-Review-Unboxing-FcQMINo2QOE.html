limited edition t-shirt and in-game
items for planetside 2 click now to
learn more so I knew gigabyte made
laptops but we've never really
encountered one that I looked at and
went holy crap we have to unbox that we
have to show that to everyone this all
changes with the P 34 gene this is the
first thing I've seen that I would
consider to be a genuine competitor to
the razor blade 14 now the razor blade
14 has a beautiful industrial design
smoking hardware that is to say it runs
a little on the hot side and it's
amazingly fast and one of the worst LCDs
that I have seen on a laptop in the last
10 years the P 34 G takes that 1600 by
900 horrible TN panel LCD that's on the
blade 14 and upgrades it to a 1920 by
1080 VA panel
alright so instead of TN we're looking
at an a hva panel which is going to mean
better color reproduction and
compromising perhaps a little bit on the
response time from a gaming perspective
now you might say well Linus i'm never
willing to compromise on response time
to which i would reply oh c'mon response
time is important but when we're talking
you know a panel that has color shift
when you move sort of three inches to
the right or the left that's that's not
something that i'd consider to be
acceptable so where do we compromise on
this one well number one is build
quality okay so the bottom of the unit
is plastic what's good about it is we do
have access to upgrade the components so
it comes with a single eight gig module
of memory in this particular
configuration but it can be upgraded to
up to 16 gigs
it comes with get this guys and this is
another advantage over the blade 14 it
comes with an N SATA slot for an SSD and
a tuna half-inch mounting point for a
hard drive up to one terabyte so you can
have up to 256 gigs of SSD goodness and
one terabyte of storage for your OS and
then all of your games and music and
movies and all that good stuff Supra
cool so there's two heat pipe
going to each the CPU and the GPU you
can actually kind of see them through
that vent right there and they each
exhaust separately from the back of the
system and other than that there's not
much of note on the bottom we got some
little rubber feet and stuff like that
okay all right another advantage against
the blade 14 so Kensington give me the
Ethernet port why is there a VGA port on
this laptop well in much the same way
that the blade 14 is targeted to the
traveling gamer you know the businessman
who likes to kick back and play some
games in the hotel room at the end of
the day VGA is necessary it's necessary
for business meetings because all them
projectors and all them board rooms
support VGA only USB 3 ports including
apparently one boosted one for faster
charging a key a headphone microphone
combo jack and then moving around to the
other side we've got USB 2 then we've
got another USB 2 a card reader HDMI out
and wouldn't mind it seen DisplayPort
there and power in all right so
disadvantage against the blade 14 this
is quite a large power brick this isn't
really something that I'd consider to be
too awesome this is six point one five
am point five volts razor really did a
great job on their power brick making it
truly as portable as the laptop so you
got to factor that into the size a
little bit size it's very similar to the
blade the top of the unit metal finish
so that is not like the underside that's
made of plastic and then moving into the
inside here yes okay so we've got I
can't quite tell but that it looks like
more plastic and then a metal finish on
the inside so all the parts that you're
actually going to touch are made of
metal now I know what I haven't even
talked about specs at all yet and that's
because there's not really much to say
it's about what you'd expect out of a
modern laptop that you know runs modern
hardware so it's got a core i7 4,700
square processor so that runs from 2.4
gigahertz up to 3.4 gigahertz turbo it
has a GTX 760 m with 2 gigs of gddr5
memory that makes it a very respectable
performer when it comes to gaming
especially compared to laptops other
laptops that are this thin so just like
the blade 14 this is truly a portable
gaming box it has a 14 inch ahv a 1920
by 1080 panel so it's full HD all that
good stuff it uses a matte screen rather
than a glossy screen
they're not faking things when it comes
to the the vibrant color and the
sharpness of the image by putting a
glossy screen in front of it it it has a
forty 7.7 watt six cell battery it is 21
millimeters thick one point six seven
kilograms I'm just trying to see if
there's anything else I forgot ah yes
the e L backlighting on the keyboard so
it has an auto sensing keyboard so we're
gonna go ahead and cover what is
presumably the light sensor here and see
if we can get that to kick in on the
last notebook that I checked out that
had an L backlight was actually the Acer
Aspire s7 quite like the implementation
there I guess we'll have to do b-roll to
show this off but the overall keyboard
layout is what I consider to be pretty
good full-size shift keys interest enter
keys and backspace and Oh Cardinals
seems committed
although these these are a shame these
arrow keys really are a shame because if
you were going to use it as a gaming
laptop and you were going to game using
the arrow keys that would be a bit of an
issue for you although I suspect most
people won't be doing that it also
doesn't have a click pad so it has a
dedicated touchpad with dedicated
buttons below what I personally prefer
this implementation but I've seen other
reviewers complain about it so I figured
it's something that's probably worth
mentioning it comes with Windows 8 known
touchscreen though so if you do want
touchscreen then I guess you'll probably
just go have to go buy something with a
touchscreen because neither this nor the
blade which were the only two super
portable gaming notebooks I'm aware of
come with a touchscreen so basically
guys the age-old can it run crisis the
answer is yes we've spent a little bit
more time with the LCD and while it's
not perfect it's not as good as you'd
expect from you know a really nice IPS
or a VA desktop display it is so much
better than what we've seen on other
laptops over the past several years and
a lot better than what's on the blade
that I give it I give it a pass it is it
is just quite nice now this is something
that's actually probably the most
impressive thing to me about this laptop
so far the keyboard is by the way what I
would classify as not just good but
excellent there's a little bit of flex
to it but I hope you guys can hear the
sound the keys have quite a nice tactile
response even when you're typing the
onboard sound is nothing special but
you'll probably want to use headphones
on a laptop most of the time but this is
where things get really really in
pressive even compared to the blade
which was already an engineering marvel
we have put a thermal probe right here
on the wrist rest this is an important
spot for us because this is where your
hands gonna rest when you're on WASD it
is running at under 26 degrees on the
palm rest that is out standing what that
means is your hand is not going to sweat
or get unnecessarily hot when you're
using this laptop like it did with the
aluminum shelled razor blade now if we
take this and we put it somewhere like
on the exhaust at the back I think we're
gonna see a bit of a different story now
the exhaust is angled down in kind of a
clever way but let's go ahead and take a
spot where it might rest on your lap and
look at what kind of temperatures we're
gonna get there we're just gonna paste
that down so I'm gonna go ahead and
reject that call gotta love my pebble so
that's gonna be running at you know into
the 30s so there we go now that we've
put that down we've got it running you
know anywhere between about 38 40
degrees so much like the blade it's not
something that I would consider to be a
laptop in the same way that I wouldn't
consider a fire to be suitable for
putting on your lap but but for the
traveling business person who just wants
something that they can game with on the
go
this looks like an absolutely
outstanding choice so I think that
concludes my video on the p30 4G from
gigabyte a most excellent portable
