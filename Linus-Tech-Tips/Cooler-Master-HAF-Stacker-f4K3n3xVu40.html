more welcome to my unboxing and overview
of the Affordable liquid coolers wet
dream get it it's a wet dream because
it's there dreaming about liquid cooling
not sure what you guys thought I was
talking about this my friends is the
half a stacker there's actually two
parts I have here today the half stacker
935 and the half stacker 9:15 F so
inside this one we have a full blown
mini ITX case that can also be stacked
to this one and inside this one we have
two components the 925 which is the the
sort of the main that's where your ATX
chassis is piece as well as another 915
but in this case is a 915 are so
unboxing the half stacker 935 is a bit
of a treat holy cow so huge inside we
find fairly thick but hard foam a static
shock awesome fairly thick hard foam but
at least it's on the fairly thick side
and they put another reinforcement piece
right here mid package so there's
actually three pieces of foam on the
thing since we took it out upside down
the case is of course upside down and
this will reveal the first look at the
half
stacker alright now that we've flipped
it over we're going to find a couple of
things here so number one is that mid
section actually goes right in between
the two pieces of the case that are
included with the 935 package so here we
find the stacker 915 are in all of its
glory and then under that okay
here we go here's another nice thick
piece of foam very Hardy looking for
that back in the Box is the 925 so you
can clearly see this is not really meant
necessarily to be its own standalone
chassis the top is it is holy
it's full of holes you know holy
building holes Batman as Robin would say
if that show still existed we also have
a nice little instruction booklet on how
to stack which of course refers to the
popular pastime of cups to em no
actually it refers to how to stack the
half stack er so there's a few different
configurations they show you 1/2 945 is
1/2 935 which is what you see here plus
another 1/2 950 which is what we have so
that's a main one in two small ones you
can put three half nine 15 so that's as
high as clear master recommends going
without additional support or you can do
to half nine 15s or you can just have
one of these or just one of these and
there are lots of different options so I
think the only way to really tackle e an
unusual case like this is in a bit of an
unusual fashion so we'll start at the
bottom where we have okay so there's
actual rubber grommets right in the
bottom of your cat what is going what
madness is this this is the way that you
are going to be able to pass through
cables or water cooling tubes or
whatever else you might want into
potentially a second 9/15 that is on the
bottom of the 925 here so I'm going to
show you how you would remove the
removable feet just like this pull those
babies off and then you can turn this
into a stackable module modular rail
here so that can be used to stack them
to an additional case we've also got a
removable power supply fan filter right
here on the bottom a fairly small one
but no no I'm not too many marks off for
that and now let's continue with this
unorthodox chassis here now we're going
to go to the right side panel where we
will find not a whole lot blank side
panel all right now we're going to go to
the top where yes see that probably
looks familiar now that is that same
stacking interface nice rugged robust
plastic considering the price of this
case it's actually quite well built from
my initial impressions then we can move
around to the front of the case where we
find three five and a quarter inch drive
bays as well as the characteristic full
honeycomb mesh that we find on stacker
cases or rather half cases excuse me
because it's all about the high airflow
also we've got our IO so we have two USB
2.0 ports two USB 3.0 ports headphone
microphone ports as well as a power
switch just like that and
then on the left-hand side panel we find
a nice tinted window I'm liking that
actually it looks quite sharp I'm a bit
of a fan of the whole tinted window
thing I think they look really really
good and we're going to go ahead and
slide that off to reveal the internals
of the 925 which we will actually get
back to so now let's carry on to the 915
R this is the one that comes with the
935 so you get at least two modules now
this does not have feet on the bottom of
it but what it does have is it has a
case top piece so you can see the way
it's intended to be used out of the box
is with this one with feet on the bottom
on the rails this one with no feet on
the bottom on the rails and this one
stacked on top of this one a little
something like this just like that
you put four screws in one two three
four on either side and you have
yourself one handy dandy monstrosity of
a massive case here now that's not to
say that that's the only way you can do
it you saw me removing screws from the
top of the 915 are just a second ago and
I'm going to just finish doing that and
show you guys the other option that's
available to you so I'm just going to
pull out this last screw here so feet
lids and other cases all use the same
modular interface so that they can be
swapped around so there right there is a
nice included honeycomb ventilation
thing as well as a dust filter I meant
the included dust filter of course sod
you know a top panel is included with a
top panel that's not really sort of a
thing but anyway this gives us our first
look inside the 915 are where it now is
pretty much empty okay this side panel
also has a nice included dust filter so
go ahead and check that out and
integrated radiator mounting so that
leads us to the first real use of these
915 units and that is as the dedicated
rad box you could actually do two 280
millimeter radiators in push-pull or two
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiators in push-pull throw those on
the side panels here and be pretty much
ready to rock so the are also comes with
three three and a half or two and a half
inch drive mounting points as well as a
five and a quarter inch drive mounting
point which you can see through the top
be
because that's about the only way we're
going to reach it also you can see that
it has an M ITX motherboard tray and a
power supply mount at the back and then
ITX cutout as well as a spot for a dual
slot graphics card so this could be a
full mitx system or it could just hold
radiators or it could just hold drives
in fact what you'll notice up here is
that in addition to these bays right
here there are mounting point for two
more of them so we could pull the drive
cages out of the bottom for improved air
flow to our graphics cards here throw
those up here and put all of our drives
up in the top routing power to them
isn't as much of a problem as you might
think because you can just use splitters
once you get up there but mounting SATA
from your motherboard might be a little
bit of a challenge the good news though
is that there are at least four
different places where you can bring
them through so that you can get access
to all the different drives with all the
different SATA cables alright so that
leads me to where I was heading with my
explanation further explanation of the
modular interface and that is here so if
we wanted to we could go you know what I
just want like you know I just want you
know two systems I just want two cases
so I'm just going to use a nine twenty
five on its own and I'm going to use the
nine fifteen as like a bare bones
skeleton I'm going to put like you know
a secondary little storage server in it
or something you can totally do that
right out of the box you can install two
systems into the one challenge is that
this guy does not include the front IO
by default you can pick that up as an
aftermarket option from Coolermaster so
there is that all right so let's finish
up our tour of the internals of the 925
before we continue to move along here
with this very very complicated case
alright so inside here we find those two
three and a half inch bays that I
mentioned before so those can hold
either two and a half inch SSDs or three
and a half inch drives be able to have
another SSD mount on the back of the
motherboard tray you can actually see
how that's going to be installed there
but don't worry able to take off that
other side panel and show that to you
guys these are fully removable
unfortunately these cannot be relocated
here which would have been quite nice
that would have given us some additional
options in terms of cable routing and
all that we have to list five and a
quarter inch bays up here in the top
right corner as well as a
pretty actually a pretty good number of
different sort of rubber grommet options
the one challenge here again is that
there's actually less than an inch of
space behind here so make sure your
cable management is tight otherwise you
might have a little bit of difficulty
closing that other side panel all right
we've got a bottom mounted power supply
as well as a seven plus one
configuration for the PCI slot so you
could install an excel ATX motherboard
if you want it rather there's an eight
plus one configuration so you could go
ex-lax here they could put something
like a fan controller there in terms of
included fans for a half series case I'd
say the included fans aren't that
impressive but we've got a 140
millimeter at the back and then I
believe there is nothing at the front in
this particular one but then there is I
think it's an 80 millimeter fan or
something like that yeah that's an 80
millimeter fan in the top one so it has
options for fan mounting but not a ton
of fans included but when you consider
the price I'd say that's that's actually
pretty pretty reasonable alright so I'll
show you guys those fan options that I
was trying to get at before you just got
to pop these tabs out from the inside
and you can pop the whole front off like
that so you can throw a couple more 120
millimeter fans here you'll get better
airflow out of these obviously though if
you remove those drive caddies and throw
them up into the included 915 R that is
definitely going to be my recommended
configuration for this case so let's go
ahead and check out that back panel
which I alluded to before but haven't
actually shown you yet so there's that
SSD mount in the middle as well as a
little bit of room for cable management
but again really not as much as I'd like
especially given the way that you're
going to want to run cables over here if
you do mount your hard drives here but
of course you do have the option of
running up through the top of the case
and through the bottom of the case
depending on where you keep your stuff
in fact I think probably my recommended
configuration out of the box if you're
not liquid cooling would be take all
your hard drives chuck them down below
run everything down here and then down
here from your power supply and then
have nice open air flow for your for
your gaming system component alright so
this is the 915 F this is the one that's
available as an aftermarket option you
can see that it comes with both a top
piece and with feet so that means it can
be used as a standalone case unlike the
other two
which do not come with all the pieces
that you'd actually need to use them
each individually and it also has a bit
of a a bit of a smarter layout in terms
of if you were to use it as a standalone
case so rather than you know having a
bunch of mounts for three and a half
inch drives for example where it's it's
really just meant to be overflow space
for radiators and drives or whatever
else for a different case it has its
drive mounts kind of spread around and
then it has a configuration that allows
for a bit of a bigger CPU cooler for
example the 915 R that's include oh it
has the same radiator mounts though so
you could still just use it as a rad box
through radiators on the side so you can
see here in the included one the are
your power supply goes at the back
that's what the R is for rear mounted
power supply and there's really not much
clearance for a CPU cooler here so you
could install a full system in there but
it's really not intended for you to do
that whereas this one the power supply
actually goes way over here in the front
so they have a removable dust filter
right here below it and then you've got
your exhaust out the front of the case
right up here and then you've got an
extension cable that runs to your power
supply from the back of the case so that
you don't have to plug your power your
power directly into the front of your
case you've also got a five and a
quarter inch bay up here that includes
on the bottom here hopefully I can get
you guys a good angle of that three and
a half inch and two and a half inch
mounting holes you have another set of
three and a half inch and two and a half
inch mounting holes down here on the
bottom and then you have a third set
here on this cross brace so you can put
a total of three three and a half inch
or three two and a half inch drives or
of course if you install an optical
drive then you will you'll be missing
that option but we also find here is
that optional accessory that's available
for the other one with front i/o so USB
three audio as well as a power switch
now airflow inside this guy isn't really
that optimal it was more of an
afterthought you know hey why don't we
make this available as a standalone case
as well as as an upgrade module to the
half stacker because it's really not
necessarily the best ITX case in the
world it just happens to be a part of
what is the biggest most versatile
liquid cooling and/or storage case for
gamers that that's pretty much out there
so you've got more rubber grommets for
high just knock that one out
oops more rubber grommets for
pass-through as well as some other
things for pass-through and then I
those same mounting holes so we could
put three three and a half inch cages in
here and run in additional nine drives
out of this one as well as in the other
one so there it is guys that is what
Coolermaster internally refers to as the
half stacker 9:45
a 9:15 our a 9:15 F and a 9:25 many of
these parts modular these side panels
can be moved around you can see we
actually ended up with some extra
modular parts when we assembled the case
we've got two extra sets of feet and an
extra top so if we bought another 925 we
could get a full additional ITX case and
a full additional ATX case out of the
deal so that's that's actually something
to consider that's one large case and
then one medium in one small case for
what would effectively be I guess just
around four hundred and fifty dollars or
five hundred dollars or something like
that that's not bad so I'm going to
spend probably the rest of this video
I'm going to take these apart again to
talk about the possibilities of a
building in here some of what
Coolermaster thinks people might do with
it and some of them some of what I
realistically think people actually
might do with it because frankly some of
their ideas are not very good one of the
ideas they had was oh you could use it
for crypto coin mining and I'm like well
no because you wouldn't use a mini ITX
system for crypto coin mining because
you could only have one GPU in it and
particularly if you're mining light
coins then you're going to need lots of
GPUs and then even if you're mining
bitcoins you're going to need dedicated
folding cards anyway and so you'll need
PCI expansion slots and it doesn't
really have that but where I see this
being useful is more like I thought one
interesting scenario was render farm so
if you wanted to have your your render
your rendering offload machine actually
like straps to your main video editing
PC another interesting use case scenario
that I see is lots of storage if you
really want a ton of storage in your PC
you could actually run three cages here
three cages here so that would be a
total of 18 drives between these two you
could run another six here which would
be a total of 24 drives and all of that
would fit in a chassis that eat all
these pieces combined is less than
dollars so you know you could look at it
you go well you could get like a Norco
24 bay you know for you case for that
money it would take up less space but
you would be paying a lot more for
that's about five hundred dollars also
the three and a half inch drive sleds
are quite excellent so you just release
the clip on the back pull it wide and
then without doing any bending like
we've seen in a lot of our recent drive
sleds it's also quite solid you can go
ahead attach your drive and then slide
that in it feels good even without a
drive installed in it and I think
Coolermaster was actually the first one
to to implement the whole super flimsy
drive cages but that are really firm
once you get a drive in them but now
they've gone away from that anyway
another scenario that I see people using
this for is very extreme liquid cooling
so being able to put dual 360s up here
dual 360s down here in the bottom run
all your tubing in between using all
these convenient holes or you can
actually it's like it feels like a magic
trick right it's like oh I put my hand
in this computer it comes out in this
computer holy crap
being able to put that much liquid
cooling horse power into something that
costs again about two hundred and fifty
dollars we're comparable if you wanted
something that fits you know for
radiators you'd be looking at something
from mountain mods where it's a cube
case and some people will like the
height here where instead of having to
compromise that much of your floor space
or that much of your decks desk space
you can have it be vertically stacked
get it stacked stacker and have it not
take up at least as much square footage
of the actual space that it sits on so
being able to fit a ton of liquid
cooling into something this inexpensive
and it takes up this much this little
floor space is quite impressive as well
one of the other things they talk about
is having your having a dedicated game
server so if you land a lot for example
you can have a dedicated game server
machine sitting up here on a little mini
ITX board also throw some extra
three-and-a-half inch expansion out
there you know take one of these out get
some extra airflow to your graphics card
that's a very realistic one having you
know an alternate gaming rig while your
main one is editing I didn't think was
that realistic because I thought my way
the other way around would be better
because then you don't necessarily have
a full-blown gaming GPU up here that
just sits there doing nothing most of
the time so in conclusion this really
isn't my cup
t if you guys have been following me for
any period of time I mean I kind of
looked at this when coolermaster
unveiled it at PAX and I kind of went
okay for the six people who are
interested in that fine but I didn't
really get a chance to look at it that
closely I didn't really get to examine
the overall build quality of it that
much at the time and now I think I
understand a little bit better it's
still not for me I prefer more like
clean lines and and plain a plain
aesthetic whereas half has never really
been about that it's been about an edgy
outward appearance and airflow above all
else cooling and flexibility and then
the stacker of DNA comes in here with
stacking and lots and lots of hardware
and it's just it's not for me I prefer
having an off loaded raid box that sits
in another room and I don't have to look
at or listen to but I definitely see the
value so for people looking for that
value oriented water-cooling case or
that value oriented storage optimized
case this really is pretty much as good
as it gets for either those things it's
also built better than I thought the one
that I saw was pre-production and it
really wasn't that impressive this one
is quite solid I would feel confident
even once it's full of hardware having
three full systems in here which you
could actually do and while I'd probably
want it against a desk or something on
one side it's really not that bad and
I'm extremely impressed I think that's
pretty much it oh yeah real user reviews
I have the benefit now reading reviews
from people who actually own the thing
and paid their own money for it and
they're all extremely positive so I
think the people who know they want this
guy's despy it you're going to be happy
with it for the people who know that
this is not for them like me well guys
you're probably not going to be happy
with it so don't force yourself one last
thing that I thought I'd include since
this is hilarious is in this
configuration has support for three full
power supplies so you could put one down
here at the front you can put one here
in the middle on the bottom of the
middle one and you can put one up here
in the top so if you did want to use the
middle Tower for example for light coin
mining then at least you'd have all the
power that you needed you could split it
across three different power supplies
