today I have a kit from Adaptec this is
their Max
i-q kit so what this does is it actually
takes one of their raid cards so here I
have an Adaptec raid card this is a I
don't even know if the part numbers on
there oh yeah there's the part number
okay so it's a retail one it is actually
a fifty four forty five if I recall yeah
there it is
it's a fifty four forty five and then
you use an SSD in this case it's an
Adaptec rebadged my SSD Rox
it's a rebadged with a dap cap branding
intel x.25 ii 32 gig so what this is for
and it's preloaded with all of the
software on the SSD so it's pretty much
ready to go all you have to do is plug
in the necessary drives to your RAID
controller so here actually inside here
we might as well do a quick unboxing
since we're doing an unboxing so we've
got their storage manager CD should
probably download the latest off the
adapt tech website as well as drivers
and documentation which you can view the
documentation here because it's here or
you can download the latest off the tech
website here this is the part name these
are the toxic or hazardous substance and
elements that I'm guessing it does not
contain ah is below the limit
requirement okay zero excellence good um
okay then we have a Quick Start Guide
for the SAS RAID controller alright then
here we have a California Proposition
isn't it known to cause birth defects
okay so don't eat this raid card please
do not eat it okay here we have well
this is useful okay so this is a little
guide on SAS connections SAS and SATA
connections so they're showing you all
the different ways that you can connect
a card to drives so you can use one of
these with a backplane you can use one
of these to an external box you can use
a splitter with a backplane okay okay so
this backplane actually does the
splitting within the backplane this one
actually takes the what is this thing
SFF eighty eighty eight or eighty eighty
seven I can't remember so that's the
internal one it takes one of those and
turns it into four SATA connectors which
SATA connectors are identical to SAS
connectors physically so you can
actually take one of these and plug it
into either SATA drive or a SAS drive or
you can plug directly into the backs of
the drives depends how you want to roll
ok max my storage with SAS what do we
got here oh here's a little guide to all
of the Adaptec connectors that you could
potentially need so here's where I'll
probably figure out which one it is yeah
sorry it's an SFF 8087
and so you need one of these breakout
cables to use for drives on this
controller that's pretty straightforward
alright cool very nice let's get on to
the part itself so the card comes with
either a full sized pci bracket or a
half-height pci bracket light ones here
right there ok so if you have like a 1u
chassis or something like that then that
would be useful so it's a 54 for up
it's a 54 45 so what that means is it's
their 5000 series card so that means it
uses a premium Intel raid on chip
controller so that means that all the
processing is done here so that's the
5000 series and then the next four means
that it has ok the two fours basically
mean that you can either have got four
drives internally or four drives
externally so this is in 8088 and this
is an 80 87 connector you can't actually
use both at the same time because the
way the routing works internally on the
card
there are actually only four data
channels that are available this is a
PCI Express 8 X card and then it has
like I said it has a processor here so
there's a heatsink these things get
incredibly hot so if you are planning to
run a RAID controller in your system
whether it's a server or like a backup
solution or a desktop you do want to
make sure you have decent ventilation
for the card they actually smell like
they're burning when they're operating
normally so that begs the question why
on earth would you want one of these
whether it's for a server or whether
it's for desktop use the reason is that
like anything dedicated versus
on board version they're just plain
better than onboard controllers it uses
like I said a PCIe 8x interface that
means it has a ton of bandwidth
available to it compared to a typical
self bridge based raid or SATA
controller you can also use SAS drives
if you really felt like it but where
they really shine is with SSDs so a
couple different ways you could use this
you could either grab a max IQ kit which
is quite expensive I have to say and
then you can use that as a cache so this
is an SSD cache and it behaves kind of
like the Seagate Momentis XT so that's
that new drive from Seagate that has a
small and in that case it's a 4 gig SSD
built in to up to a 500 gig hard drive
well in this case you are using that SSD
cache which is much larger this is a 32
gig cache it's also one of the fastest
SSDs around the X 25 X 25 e and you're
using a 32 gig cache for an entire
storage array so that means that it's
going to take all of your frequently
accessed data store it on the SSD so you
get lightning-fast random reads and
writes for those little bits of data and
then you've also you're also backed up
by a bigger storage array which can be
running raid 0 raid 1 raid 5 and then
you can access all of your bulk data
that way so you kind of get the best of
both worlds there's a few solutions out
there like this now but this one is
aimed more at a server Enterprise a
workstation level and the others like
the silverstone HDD boost or the
Momentis xt are aimed at desktop users
or laptop users respectively the other
reason to put a high end RAID controller
in your system is if you're oh yeah I
kind of already mentioned this if you're
running a bunch of SSDs you can get huge
huge reads and writes out of a dedicated
RAID controller running like 3 or 4 SSDs
versus if you're running them on your
onboard raid so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
