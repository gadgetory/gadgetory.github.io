the Orion pro ROG gaming headset from
Asus well I mean it makes sense that
it's from Asus because it is republic of
gamers the main difference between the
Orion and the Orion pro is the inclusion
of the rog spitfire so the spitfire is a
driverless USB hardware DSP digital
signal processor which basically means
it's a USB soundcard i think the
important thing is that it's driverless
because it means you don't have to worry
about plugging it in and go to the
website no no you just plug it in it
goes
easy access immersive 7.1 virtual
surround I'm actually okay if you have
if you must have surround personally I
prefer just leaving the headphones in
stereo mode but if you want surround
effects I do prefer virtual surround to
actually put in more speakers inside
headphones if you're going to run real
speakers then yeah you probably want
dedicated surround speakers but for
headphones the speakers are so close the
drivers are so close to your ear you're
not going to get the same effect that
you get from surround speakers from
headphones anyway and you end up with
these tiny little drivers that aren't
capable of producing the deep sounds
that you want for movies gaming music
I mean basically drivers that aren't
capable of producing deep sounds you
pretty much don't really really want
them so the first thing we find inside
because this is the pro version is the
Spitfire itself and I'm trying really
hard to remove the packaging there so it
comes with a braided cable and a USB
connector and then it just has on the
other end a microphone in and a
headphone out port so you could actually
use this bit fire with anything you
wanted you could even change up the
headphones you're using I really like
this approach because it drives me crazy
when manufacturers lock you into buying
an analog headset or a USB headset this
is elegant because it doesn't cost them
that much more it does cost a little bit
more to terminate the ends and then do
this and do that but it gives you that
flexibility maybe you really like this
maybe you upgrade your Orion pro to a
Sagittarius
Pro or I don't know what's coming in the
future but maybe you upgrade it maybe
you want to keep using this there you go
so or on here there's an FPS mode button
surround button as well as an amp button
so that gives you hardware access to
whatever functionality you might need on
the Spitfire so let's move on to the
headphones themselves and before we do
that let's have a look at this the heck
is this hopefully they say something
about what this is it appears to be I
have no idea we'll be back so this guy
right here is a cable organizer which is
basically just a rubber piece that has
two clips so you can organize the
actually quite long cable so this is
must be at least about an eight foot
long cable so you're able to reach
around to the back of your case or if
you don't want to reach to the back your
case then you can just coil it up jam it
in here and then have it stay presumably
sort of coiled up and jammed in here and
not have to think about that so at the
end you find your standard terminations
so there's your headphone as well as
microphone so again options gives you
the option to plug it in to the Spitfire
just like that or plug it in to your
front panel audio or even the back of
your sound card I mean it a Cesana a lot
of the headphone companies actually
makes high-end sound cards which might
be part of the reason why they care
about giving you the option to use their
audio products with their other audio
products so now let's get into the
headset itself the top has a nice big
cushion on it this is refreshing to see
it goes all the way from here to here
and is quite soft
although the foam inside here doesn't
seem to be quite as thick or supple as
the foam on the ear cups themselves so
that's a memory foam ear cup you can
clearly tell from how squishy and soft
it is and how long it takes to retract
however to sort of to perfect the the
fit of these headphones I would have
preferred to see some rotation this way
they do go up and down but the only
rotation side-to-side here is from the
the metal pieces here having a little
bit of flex in them I wouldn't have
minded seeing some actual rotation they
have a very striking looking ROG logo on
the side of each of the ear cups looks
very very nice and I mean as always all
ROG stuff looks so sharp with a mixture
of glossy metal matte plastic and red
accents even the microphone looks just
like boss and I love retractable micro
phone so hold on moron they're tractable
microphone in a moment size wise you can
go all the way from sort of ginormous
head size here you can clearly see how
big that is for me to pretty much kid
size because this is not even close like
that's where it's if my ears are hanging
right out via right at the bottom here
so I found somewhere in the middle was
about right for me which makes sense I
wear a medium motorcycle helmet the
retractable mic is as I said before
awesome I love retractable mics it means
you can wear it somewhere when you're
out and about without looking ridiculous
and hold on a minute there we go and
it's got a flexible sort of snake wire
thing on it so that you can position it
exactly where you need it next to your
mouth actually my understanding is the
corner of your mouth is where it's
supposed to sit I think that pretty much
wraps things up thank you for checking
