with a particularly cruel cliffhanger
Dennis hanging from the literal cliff
that he created in my house by stepping
through my ceiling
way to go Dennis oh my god Dennis just
fell down from now on I'm going to call
this the Dennis whole hi Dennis
seriously man that could have died but
we're done now and I'm finally ready to
unveil what I'm calling the world's most
comfortable gaming setup let's head
inside
now we weren't quite done last time when
our shooting session got cut a little
short so I'll catch you guys up on what
all was done in the meantime first the
contractors finished their handiwork
adding insulation drywall electrical and
new flooring the contrast between the
original room and the upgraded one is
stark but enough about that let's talk
about the real upgrades
I used a 2 inch PVC pipe to route cables
to the back of the Samsung KS 9500 4k s
UHD TV that they graciously provided
when they sponsored this project only
with a twist thanks to the one connect
input box I can handle all four of the
HDMI 2.0 inputs each of which is capable
of driving the full 3840 by 2160
resolution of this television at up to
60 Hertz through a single cable to the
TV mounting gear to the wall was done in
a number of ways to demonstrate the
versatility of this approach for light
items double sided 3m tape is fine but
for heavier items like the custom gaming
rig it's nice to have this wall either
plywood backed or with plywood overtop
the way that I've done it so you don't
have to worry about finding a stud when
you want to screw something in in total
the wall contains an Xbox one which is
more to demonstrate how additional
devices could be added I know it won't
read discs this way a network switch a
USB charging hub and all of my
controllers on a cool little shelf I
found at IKEA let's take a moment to
check out that custom wall-mounted PC
it's rocking an Intel Core i7 6700 K 16
gigs of dual channel ddr3 more ser and a
gtx 1070 founders Edition all in a lien
Lee PCO success aluminum and tempered
glass case now I know that I only built
this thing a short while ago but it's
also just been upgraded with
individually sleeved green cables from
cable mod and RGB lighting with a remote
control so it can actually be turned all
the way off when complete blackness is
desired time for the biggest challenge
of this project mounting the TV step 1
was to figure out where the devil to put
it something that's very difficult to
eyeball by the way
then step two was to secure it I
actually ordered two other mounts before
reaching out to Kanto for help and they
sent over there F sixty eighty which
solved all my problems
this sucker mounts with six beefy screws
into the wood roof supports and can
handle up to 200 pounds of entertainment
goodness yep okay which is good because
this TV is one heavy mother I plugged it
into the power outlet behind it there's
an extra plug there for a soundbar
upgrade in the future if needed and with
a lot of help got it in position locked
it in place
tuck the cables behind it and wait a
minute I need a chair but not just any
chair a chair that allows the user to
recline at the perfect angle to view the
ceiling mounted TV straight on I think I
got it little man oh there we go
oh this yellow thing I ordered off
Amazon was horrible and cost $400 so I
reached out to loveSac and they hooked
us up with the pillow sack and a super
comfy cover for it this thing rocks so
at this point I could have easily
stopped the project and said okay
mission accomplished but I wanted to
make the room a comfy play area for my
kids as well so I added a fun magnet
wall a couple tipped over bookshelves
and another small beanbag chair to sit
and read and finally a couple of end
tables for the pillow sack but did it
work
actually yeah a lot of things came
together to make this one of the most
unbelievable movie watching and gaming
experiences that I have ever encountered
first is all the technology in the TV at
this viewing distance 4k absolutely
makes a difference but there's more to
it than that
it features quantum dot technology which
we've covered in more detail before to
achieve better energy efficiency keeping
the room cooler and both the better
color performance and increased peak
brightness of a thousand nits that allow
this set to meet the requirements for
the UHD premium HD our standard
in a nutshell HDR means more details in
the high and low lights of the scene for
a viewing experience that is much closer
to what you would get in the version of
the movie that was mastered for the
theater and while HDR does require a
supported player and HDR mastered
content the onboard Netflix AK and
Samsung's Tizen OS handles it and some
content is starting to show up already
with much more coming in the summer
other ties and highlights include voice
search which you can see in action here
PS now with a DualShock controller and
for me anyway the free plex app that
lets me stream off of my home plex
server whoo now I want to take a moment
to talk then about the curve normally
I'm not convinced that it makes that
much of a difference to the viewers
immersion in the content especially on a
TV but here with the screen just a few
feet away far enough to focus
comfortably but close enough to occupy
about as much of my field of view as a
theater screen it works really well and
I even got Brandon our resident cinema
purist to sign off on it saying quote
it's surprisingly cool and he even
pointed out that it is an awesome
solution to a problem that many of us
have faced wanting to lie on our backs
watching a video with our phone above us
only to have our arms get tired or the
phone accidentally fall please for the
love of everything
if you game on a TV make sure you're in
game mode but once you get that sorted
out what can I say it is awesome the
gaming experience is every bit as comfy
and immersive as you'd imagine I
definitely prefer the 16 by 9 aspect
ratio with a large screen to a three
display surround set up with bezels in
the middle and all the same things that
make movies awesome on this thing
popping colors strong contrast and the
curve make it fantastic for gaming I've
already had Luke over for some
two-player fun and I doubt it will be
his last visit overall I'm really
pleased with what we've accomplished
here I wasn't sure how well the concept
would work in practice but thanks to the
super comfy seat confidence-inspiring
mount and this great TV it turned out
