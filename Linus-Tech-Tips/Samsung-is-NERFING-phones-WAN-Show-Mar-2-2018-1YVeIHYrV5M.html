the thing you were gonna fix the
recording light that's what it was
we don't have one but that's okay guys
we've got a great show for you today
we actually oh man we made some crazy
crazy pants videos this week and by we I
mean me and other people not you oh it
is what it is dude it is what it is but
you guys did something really sick this
week too that's right yeah
so what uh yeah it's um apparently
didn't excite people who were reading
the the the wine show title last week
you know it doesn't love you okay
it was one of the lowest viewed when Joe
the lead funeral last year the people
that care care a lot and I love you for
it
but a flow plane went alpha you don't
show that oh yeah yeah I know no I don't
I don't want to show that I super don't
want to show that I'm gonna put oh you
know what I'm gonna put don't put it
login we put minesweeper minesweeper
doesn't come on Windows 10 does it no it
doesn't that is so stupid the windows
team that Microsoft hates fun why what
is wrong with them
I hate that you gotta go to the Xbox
team for that alright anyway well we are
off to a super when shall we start to
the show today there folks let's go
ahead wait this is wrong man why is it
called tez like that right yeah yeah we
rock on okay so check this out so I'm on
my home which the only way to navigate
to home right now is to click this which
is not super intuitive will get that
sort of note don't worry about most
websites work that's fine the mobile the
mobile one is a little weird the desktop
right that's completely fine that's fine
say that should probably be like a more
kind of different kind of home like
actually like float playing home where
you browse creators and stuff whereas
like there should be like it like an awl
or something but we'll figure you know
what he and I are gonna work this out
but basically you can see videos from
creators that you follow or you could go
to the important ones Wow
take that Kyle and you can see what's
what's gone up in the last week or so so
this is it like this is actually the
site so subscribe using credit card it's
a little yes you can okay it's not like
really in the sense that like the the
credit card data is being handled just
right it's just like the the site itself
around it okay it works it's working but
check this out you can see the videos
that we have up on flow plane that are
not yet on YouTube so I think most of
these are already up yeah and just so
you guys know if you have a forum
account actually regardless of if you
have a subscription or not but if you
have a forum account that has a flow
clean subscription or a bit with ultra
subscription you can go to full plane
com connect the account by we're not
going to show you because LastPass is
gonna autofill some information but if
you go to the home page yeah there's a
more sign-in options drop-down button
thingy majiggy click on that click in
sign in with the LCD forum connect to
your account and then you'll have access
to whatever subscriptions you currently
have oh smart way to go because you have
add-ons disabled because you can enable
add-ons in incognito if you want it but
yeah click the sign in with ltte forum
option the other ones don't work right
now as well don't worry about it click
it can be cited but don't be before I'm
often connect your account you'll have
access which is great so there's a
couple at least a couple videos on there
that are pretty freaking cool this is
really cool we've got three VR headsets
running off of a single motherboard
single tower using virtualization we did
the top five most insane cases yes that
is a case that is a real case you can
buy it if you're baller enough these are
the feedback on these videos is really
good and you can actually see the
aforementioned feedback on the
floatplane website check that out
no way Oh hold on I don't know if audio
is on sorry guys
no way comments oh okay we should
probably fix that jumps back on video
yeah oh no maybe that what happened
there but anyway check this out comments
comments hey hey hey
Dig Dug at all this is my first visit
here so these are my initial impressions
look and feel the site is spot-on hekia
very professional-looking there's
teething problems there is like needing
to logout and then in again after
subscribing okay yep were you even aware
that one yeah yeah okay yeah the video
buffering is an issue I'm stuck as low
as 480p okay no that's weird because
we've actually been we've done pretty
well there um cool to see it might be a
location thing there's still some like
using in that needs to happen there yeah
should I do it switch 1080p see how well
it goes
there has been some minor problems with
that and we've been doing some Rika
jiggering cool look at that so that
might be causing an issue
ah right cuz I think we're trying to
change it so that it remembers your last
what you last selected properly without
jumping to 360 first and then jumping
back and then jumping back out and
usually if you like pause it and then do
it again it works because alpha whatever
we're actually also having some issues
with our connection here oh of course
the second I switch it's like so it's
working yeah it's a typical right right
I suspect that's actually not flow plane
although it could be at this point
because things are things are in a
pretty delicate state right now but
anyway the alphas up the ending now yeah
yeah it works every other time we've
shown on winch oh and it will work again
yep
do not worry uh what if we go for topics
this week like did anything oh right
yeah things did happen no no no the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 happened
nope nothing happened that happened what
else do we have
horizon 720 700 X is rumored to may have
maybe be happening at some point okay I
think this is sort of a big deal this is
back to the Samsung Galaxy S 9 word on
the street is that Samsung might be
nerfing the
version of the phone oh so that it's not
too much better than the snapdragon 845
version that's so as to upset their
customers okay so that's pretty that's
pretty interesting you know that
actually kind of makes sense I celebrate
oh go ahead it's dumb but it makes sense
celebrate is advertising they can now
break the security of iOS 11 including
the iPhone 10 what else happened this
week our intro worked then
right you got Nazir's copy
brought you by synergy 2 and brought to
you by honey I mean anything sounds kind
of weird when you say it like that but
honey sound especially weird
apparently the sound is super quiet on
the intro you know whatever nice someone
says they needed that for bingo so you
know needed what you're lost is someone
else's gain and control nice all right I
don't know man I don't know man
alright let's jump right into our first
topic here how would how would that be
for and someone's gonna lose their bingo
if we start talking about tech and he
seems like one of minutes into you know
it wouldn't surprise me there's a lot of
stuff that happens on this show a lot
that probably shouldn't happen on the
show no the creator of wine show bingo
tweeted me I felt I felt pretty special
yeah yeah that's good that's good
so this was supposed to be Edward the
weeb on the forum thanks for that and
there's the unnecessarily loud laugh
tile the original article is from WC CF
tech AMD's second-generation rise in
7:00 at 2700 X rumored to be 8 core 12
excuse me 8 core 16 thread 3.7 gigahertz
base up to 4.2 gigahertz boost with xfr
so what this tells us is that
second-generation risin is looking like
a pretty small sort of tweak you know
ironing out a couple of wrinkles
you know don't expect all of a sudden to
be getting you know 48 core versions
that are clocked at 5 gigahertz or
anything like that evolutionary rather
than revolutionary but let's see 16
Meg's level 3 cache for makes level 3
I'd be surprised if it does to be
perfectly honest this is gonna be priced
above then or do you think they're just
gonna I think they're gonna slot these
in above the existing ones here you can
see the spec sheet comparison so there's
the 1700
here's the replacement 2700 X so we're
going down to 12 nanometer which gets us
anywhere from 200 to 300 megahertz
higher clock speeds at the same TDP one
year later so I mean okay I can see some
people being disappointed because Rison
was like I forget what AMD was quoting
it was like 40% or like 60% better than
their previous generation but it's not
fair that was because AMD actually
hadn't really done a whole lot in the
last four to five years leading up to it
and so as much as it's easy to harp on
Intel for these incremental generational
improvements in cpu performance now
we're seeing that when all AMD has to
work with is a very small manufacturing
process shrink it's really hard to do
those generational leaps and performance
the way that they did way back in the
day like when AMD went from the Barton
core to a sledgehammer clawhammer I
think we're the first were those the
first Athlon 64 within minutes so
financing and like when Intel went from
the netburst family up to Conroe so that
doesn't really happen that often anymore
and you did Sonny now that I think about
it when Intel did it way back when that
was because they had been not
necessarily sitting on ass for a few
years but they had been barking up the
wrong tree for a few years that's for
sure yeah so hmm I wonder how long it
has been since we've seen like a massive
improvement like wow where can we find
the last one maybe it would be Athlon 64
on AMD side yeah no just in general the
last time we saw a really big
generational improvement with that said
Conroe to Intel's integrated memory
controller was a pretty big leap to
because we went no because they
introduced
quad-core first hard to say in terms of
I know I know it wasn't in a lot of
different ways but in terms of like
customer understanding and usability
which is a weird thing largely due to
naming but okay Andy bridge you think so
I think a lot of people kind of got it
more okay so you know what I'm gonna
pick my moment for me the lot the
biggest CPU improvement in performance
was not actually Barton to claw hammer
for me the biggest difference I saw was
from and yeah again my point is not just
performance stuff like I felt like the
community like paying attention to
forums and stuff like that I felt like
people understood more but that one
because the the product naming scheme I
think made more sense for a lot of so I
think it was Winchester was the last
single core know vet Venice might have
been San Diego
oh crap which one was it a salon 64
models okay um the camera is tilted what
yeah okay so I
oh no no it's uh it's not centered yeah
the thing is yeah whatever also there's
some worry and your sweater if we want
to get really you know it's very things
that we don't worry about on the land
show so for me the big one was going
from single core Athlon 64 to I think it
was the Toledo core going to dual core
Athlon 64 because that was it wasn't a
big improvement for gaming because back
up that camera still dude what are they
sorry just keep going I'll be back I
think I do
okay Oh max is here mac max is coming to
save us because it wasn't a big
improvement for gaming you got to
remember that games did not benefit from
dual-core CPUs back in those days but
what it was was a huge improvement to
the gaming experience if you had things
running in the background and it was a
huge improvement to really the
experience of doing anything at the same
time that was one yeah yeah yeah yeah
really happened from yeah and that's a
really big deal especially in terms of
user experience yeah yeah and it's like
this it's the same way and you know the
funny thing is I remember arguing on
forums about dual core back in the day
because people who didn't see the bigger
picture who just saw the benchmarks on
whatever the site they preferred was and
saw that in all their favorite games it
didn't make a difference those people
would come out and say you're paying
literally twice as much for literally
twice as many CPU cores and it doesn't
make any difference and it's the same
argument that I would have with people
when SSDs were first starting to gain
popularity where they'd go well the
benchmarks don't indicate a significant
difference in performance other than
like boot time and they're very low
capacity
it feels really different and that's
what it was like then yeah and honestly
since since the first good SSDs so like
back when Intel launched the X 25mm
I haven't really had that experience
again what was the first I'm not gonna
Google I was ask you you probably know
what was the first generation that Intel
introduced Kay for their unlockable SKUs
I believe it was the 2600 K yeah yeah so
this is kind of no no no no there was an
8 7 5k was this yes and back then the so
the 8 7 5k was Linfield yeah Linfield
so Linfield was architectural II the
same as bloomfield which was the
high-end socket 1366 platform I think
it'd be fair to say that Sandy Bridge
popularized that though
yeah so that was a big difference for
you I think so I found on forums and
discussing with my friends and all those
kind of stuff people understood it a lot
more when sandy bridge came around and
they changed the number schemes of
things there's easier to understand like
I v i7 really 2600 K a 2500 k k non-kpop
whole we're taking this to a strawpoll
because it could be my little bubble I
don't know I want to know okay so
there's a couple of angles to this but
but I'll get into it okay
core I X more or less confusing okay
than before and to be clear if you want
to understand the entire stack it might
even be slightly more confusing but if
you're like is this one better or worse
it's it's kind of easy
okay guys hit that strawpoll I've got
that in the twitch chat hit the straw
poll so okay so here's the problem
within a generation and within a product
family remembering that laptop product
family is not the same as desktop
product family and not the same as you
know enterprise product family then I
can see core i3 Core i5 core i7 being
simpler to understand however from
generation to generation I would argue
when it got WAY worse I'm just saying
with that generation yeah it brought
people into understanding yeah and I
feel like a lot of people held on after
that but yes it got messy it was really
confusing I mean nowadays you'll see
posts on craigslist where people are
just saying core i7 pc yeah $300
whatever but we're way beyond we're not
in the Sandy Bridge generation anymore
okay okay and now and now I think
understanding has gone up as a whole so
you see that you go I know that's BS and
then you look into it I think the
understand and I know people are wow
this is like 50/50 I don't remember the
last time I saw our community this
evenly split that's crazy
easy I I think it I think Sandy Bridge
brought the understanding of the entire
industry as a community up and I think
people held on whether this is people
saying is it confusing in general now
using now it's a mess now absolutely but
I think like the knowledge base as a
community has gone up okay and you can
argue like well I was on overclock net
back in 2003 and we understood way more
back then sure yeah definitely OCN is
not a good sample to pick from though
yeah cuz you're all hardcore you guys
are not representative of the general
population all the forum dudes yep
probably knew what was going on
yeah that's not who I'm talking about
I'm going a little bit I mean forums as
in like gaming forums and stuff not like
overclocking computer hardware forums so
this is an interesting point on it cage
in twitch chat said something kind of
insightful LTT viewers are more
technical in general so if 50% of us see
it is more confusing regular people have
no hope I don't think that's but what's
interesting where I'm going with this is
think about it this way I think regular
people who go yeah I get it I 3 is less
than I 5 is less than I 7 would actually
vote less confusing yes even if they
didn't know it but they were really
confused or are totally wrong right
definitely yeah so which is what I liked
about Sandy Bridge right they just over
years or different launches in released
okay so this is interesting this is a
really good point from NFS em 654 it's
with Sandy Bridge some of the core i5s
would dual core with onboard graphics
yeah so this was before Intel
standardized on onboard graphics being
on everything because they were still
building the IGP you on the package but
not on to the die yet so quad core chips
didn't have enough room for onboard
graphics and the dual cores did meaning
that inter compatibility
on motherboards was actually quite
confusing so I'd still maintain I think
the overall knowledge base of the
community went up and some of that's
definitely boiled into okay there was a
really weird naming change that just
happened what's going on sorry did I say
Sandy Bridge Linfield
I'm sorry Linfield Linfield I think a
lot of it was what's going on and people
talking about the differences between
different processors and what threads
are and all of this other kind of stuff
and like the differences between threads
and cores a lot of these conversations
started around the Sandy Bridge time and
a lot of people actually cared about
processor specs right now it's kind of a
mess and a lot of people are interested
in CPUs but the more recent interest in
CPUs has been hey there's competition
now what's better to explain to me
what's better and I like AMD finally
have something to upgrade to yeah I'm
not necessarily saying that it was a
good thing I'm not saying I'm just
saying that the the I think the
knowledgebase it's a whole increased at
that time right and I like that all
right let's move on to back I don't know
I don't care anymore let's move on to
the Galaxy S 9 so this was posted in the
forum by d13 H for our d2l I ve died
hard to live in the very worst
leet-speak of all and there's no spaces
yeah but anyway noticed that édouard the
web had your like cat ear long purple
hair photo thing that was alright
article here is from TechCrunch calm
with the galaxy their headline is with
the galaxy s 9 samsung put the
fingerprint sensor where it belongs and
i guess that's probably the headline
because there isn't a whole lot else to
say about it I actually missed my
briefing today that I was supposed to
attend oh no I still don't have a device
how will we know what its specs and
stuff are but fortunately sort of news
flash for the kanay
in PR team the rest of the world is a
thing and the Internet
Wow the Internet oh and so I can just
read about this stuff on other
publications website that's amazing
where they already know this stuff
because they already had their briefings
like a week ago
not that I'm salty or upset or anything
it's just that it's like whoa bigger net
being in Canada is like a big like a big
dick slap sometimes you don't matter
yeah your population is literally 1/10
of the u.s. less than the state of
California do you know what we don't
give a spit anyway it's got the best DXL
mark rating ever of 99 though it should
be close it should be noted that the
pixel 2 is at 98 and the iPhone 10 is at
97 so we really are splitting hairs at
this point looks pretty similar to last
gen but better camera as I just
mentioned snapdragon 845 in the US and
China and then Exynos whatever the crap
it is something 9 something something
else where they moved the fingerprint
sensor to a more useable spot I think
already said that they're gonna have an
emojis though to be clear they're not
normal emojis like apples the more like
we Me's or bitmoji remember Me's well I
don't know probably the biggest antenna
fanboy you know did they have it on the
Wii U yeah
wait did you have a week you had a week
yeah I play more we now than I did when
it launched it's still great my sisters
yeah I only play Wii Sports yeah my son
loves Wiis but we sports is amazing I
actually I interrupt this very
compelling news about the Samsung Galaxy
S 9 to bring you a personal confession
something that is actually really hard
for me to talk about it's it's it's
actually related to the Nintendo Wii so
as some of you probably know my son is
about five and wow he's also Lee
something shut up okay let me just I
need to ease my self into this okay so
my son is almost six and could you maybe
enjoy this a little less I'm so excited
sorry continue my son is almost sick
shut up just keep going just chill out I
believe in you so my son is almost six
and he's been playing Wii we actually
created a me for him when he was like
three and a half I was like trying to
see if like the stick wiggling was
simple enough that he could do it wasn't
he wasn't he wasn't ready yet but over
probably the last year or so he's gotten
to the point where he actually uses the
wheat more than the vibe which is
depressing for a whole level yeah but
but he's gotten to the point where he's
played enough Wii Sports that first like
he would he was like a pro in Wii tennis
right you know how you can play against
the computer and you get over a thousand
skill level and you're a pro tennis and
the tennis one that's not the tennis one
is pretty easy and but he got to the
point where he was not just a pro but he
had a skill level of like sixteen
hundred and fifty or something which was
more than mine mine was fourteen hundred
and something but the reason that my
skill level wasn't very high was I never
played single player I would always play
against my wife or like my sister-in-law
because the last time I used the Wii was
when I still lived with my wife's
parents so it was like the family
console and we'd like to LaRonde on
Sunday night playing Wii Sports or
whatever yeah yeah okay so so I was
quite a bit better than my skill level
would indicate so he would like he would
go all like five-year-old kind of sulky
my skill level is higher but you still
beat me like without without even using
like the cheap return whenever you miss
a power smash there's a cheap return
that if you time it's not even that hard
to time but it's ungettable on both the
forehand and the backhand if they don't
manage to power serve and so I would
beat him to like without even using that
then
and he'd complain he'd be whining about
it then like a couple months later I'm
playing against him and he takes a set
and I'm just like oh okay
like I wasn't really paying attention I
was holding the baby on the other hand
and I was like oh shoot okay darlin can
you get down I got a I got a beat your
brother it.we tennis um then he takes
another set I hope what I'm like okay
full-on cheap mode now so I'm I'm doing
cheap returns like ungettable returns
I'm power serving everything to him and
I win it okay so I take I take three
sets in a row and he's like oh I almost
beat you literally like two weeks later
he sweeps me and I'm like is this petty
know what I don't care rematch ask for
even I asked my five-year-old son for a
rematch he beats me again straight again
I don't even feel bad about him kicking
my ass at Wii boxing because we boxing
is quite frank who can flail the best
and I'll like I'll play against him and
I'll like trying time punches and it's
just like come on it's better to flail
like it's actually better to flail and
it's so funny the way he plays it is so
funny I have a video of him doing this
so I'm saving for his wedding but
instead of just like going like this she
gets his whole body just like so the kid
the kid will like she'll come out of
playing a couple games of Wii boxing
like dredged I'm like wow this is great
because the whole idea behind the Wii
was that it was more physical yeah yeah
until like jackasses like me figured out
that they could play Twilight Princess
like this yeah you know like yeah I'm
still joystick waggling or whatever but
I'm not I'm not moving yeah so I
can still kick his butt at golf I can
still crush him at bowling actually
almost got a perfect game I I missed one
pin on the first one which made me feel
a lot better then all strikes through to
the end and then I missed one pin on the
end so I'm actually really glad I missed
that one pin at the beginning because
otherwise that one at the end would have
destroyed me as a person yeah oh oh is
there a Wii U one okay cool
maybe I should get a Wii U probably
cheap and then what's the what's the
last game oh the baseball baseball movie
is just stupid like yeah he beat me at
baseball but like baseball is just a
matter of like who luckily connects with
a pitch because as soon as a human is
pitching you could just throw all the
cheapest garbage and it's like
unhittable do you have the improved
sensors I don't okay I don't think we
sports is Wii MotionPlus compatible
though so I don't think it matters
the Wii U controllers have it built-in
yeah and they're the same size as the
default controllers okay which is kind
of nice cool
and I believe all Wii U games work with
it because it's the default controller
yeah okay well maybe maybe I'll get a
weave at some point but anyway that was
my confession it actually happened I was
actually trying already trying all right
like I was I was hitting cheap shots
that I knew he didn't know about this is
like playing like NHLPA 94 and doing
wrap arounds on the bottom when someone
else doesn't know about it like that is
three ferret that's how I was playing
wrap arounds are pretty easy to like
pick up on if someone's doing it to you
yeah yeah dude man like I that's pretty
rough yeah
what is the number one game that would
hurt for him to be better than you at
you know I'm not really that good at
anything um like there's there's games
where I just really wouldn't expect him
to ever be better than me like I don't
think he'll ever be better at a
side-scroller
just cuz that genre is not really
popular like like modern side-scrollers
what like trying like that's not it like
there's some like really niche like
ultra hardcore yeah like you could argue
the
to super meatboy is a modern ish
side-scroller but even that's like years
old and and like it's a dying it's it's
it was like a it was like the you like
press down on the chest of the corpse
and it's like like it's not breathing
anymore it's just like a last last gasp
so to speak doesn't know like I so yeah
I wouldn't it yeah Cup heads nod that's
not it's not Super Mario World
yeah it's it's more advanced than that
there's more there's a lot more to it so
if he were to beat me like if you were
to be better than me at like Super Mario
World I'd feel pretty devastated but I
don't expect that to happen it would be
kind of like it would be kind of like me
being better at shuffleboard than my
grandparents like yeah if I put enough
time into it I could probably do it but
I wouldn't care yeah like I'd be
concerned about him so badminton no I
fully expect him to be better at me than
better than me at that I am planning to
when do you think they'll happen I'm
gonna be paying like $75 an hour for
badminton coaching for him within the
next few months
Oh like he is going to prodigy level
he's going to the best badminton
facility in Canada oh he is going to be
get sits here actually arguably there's
been there's been more national level
players but the other other places have
done well too they've had they've had
good products as well and then if he's
good enough I would happily pay for him
to train overseas if it comes to that so
as far as I'm concerned if he is not
beating me at badminton by the time he
was about 11 or 12 then we need to
reevaluate cuz I'm not that good so he's
into it yeah he likes it yeah yeah gave
me very broad like no he's all week I
knew that I wanted to get that out of
you so yeah twitch chat knows that
you're not just being with like no not
kind of dad yeah he's already playing a
couple times a week he likes it um I
also fully expect him to be better at
martial arts than me although by the
time he by the time he gets like a ha oh
shoot this is gonna happen sooner than I
had sort of thought about but by the
time he hits like 9 or 10 he hits
like red brown belt I'm probably gonna
have to try and get back into this I
don't get passed too quickly there but
yeah I fully expect him to be better
than me at everything if he's not that I
failed as a parent cuz that's your job
can I be like a boss along the way a
boss yeah I think he's probably gonna be
quite a bit smaller than you for ever
have you seen his mother but he'll pass
on he'll be more skilled he'll be like
the light character that you choose
that's the funny thing about that is
there's a reason that like the UFC
doesn't have heavyweights fight
lightweights
okay chun-li wouldn't actually stand a
chance against Blanca but the little
dude that he just made you Jitsu can
kick my butt so that's the thing okay
eventually I'll get with that said if
you weren't jujitsu Eng and you just
went for a football tackle yeah does
that still go down that way probably
it's a very nice guy okay so within the
constraints of the sport you get your
butt kicked but yeah um speaking of
within the constraints of Bancho let's
start with synergy two if you have two
computers or more and you have one desk
synergy 2 is the way to go it's a
software based mouse and keyboard
sharing solution that works on Windows
Mac and Linux computers is that out on
floatplane yet because that is a sick
video do you know about this yet
no we did a showcase piece for synergy
and we were kind of sitting around going
like okay how do we how do we do this
yeah there is a there's an export for
this I'm just gonna pull it up I don't
think it's actually live on floatplane
yet but I'm gonna pull this up because
it's really cool I just want to show the
demo here but we were sitting around
going you know how do we how do we do a
video for synergy that's not just a
shield piece that's like actually cool
we were like oh I don't know maybe we
could just do a shield piece and then it
might actually be cool and it worked out
really well check
so okay that ended up being a little
more a little more dramatic than I hoped
I'm just gonna skip ahead to Texas so
they're all firing up
that's windows 7 OS 10 or Mac OS sorry
Windows 10 and Linux and then what I can
do with this monitor this is that LG
monitor that's cool right that's cool
and then you can switch fullscreen with
the remote for the monitor so I was
using the remote there you can just go
you can get out of picture by picture
and go fullscreen to any one of them in
4k 60 and then you can press another
button to go back to your tile setup
cool right that is pretty cool so you
can effectively be using four different
operating system workstations at once
and switch between fullscreen and having
all of them and then when they're all on
so there's a toggle for synergy to that
they're adding or they'll have either
added it by the time this goes live or
they've added it already so that through
the task bar of any one of them you can
toggle synergy 2 on and off so that when
you go fullscreen your mouse doesn't fly
off the edges yeah because all of the
the fullscreen versus not fullscreen
that's being handled in hardware by the
monitor not by the seamless to soft
that's a really cool setup isn't it I
can actually think of a lot of different
industries that would like that oh
absolutely
so it's one of those niche things but
for the people who are into that
pretty freakin cool so anyways soon as
you - makes it easier than ever to mouse
and keyboard share between multiple
systems they've got new networking back
back-end that helps with complex
networks
they've got oh the ssl encryption has
been moved from the pro to the basic
tier so all users can benefit from
encryption and the new background
service on all platforms lets users
control all their machines before
they're even logged into the computer so
get 50% off your purchase of synergy -
we'll have that linked down
so do you seen the stock calm / synergy

because we're important too should we
get back to the galaxy yes 9 do we even
care tonight nine hundred and 60 FPS
limo that's cool
HD 0.2 22 seconds so probably end
trigger I guess I'm hoping so Oh
instead of trying to time your button
press it will apparently a I tried to
detect where the action is in the clip
and apply slow mode of that part yeah I
guess that point two seconds you
wouldn't even have time for end trigger
okay
this is interesting so the original
article hears from a non tech I was just
browsing through and I don't really know
how this wasn't bigger news I mean a non
tech called it awkward first results
that's one way of putting it but in a
nutshell it'll be either Exynos 9810 or
snapdragon 845 and if we go down bippity
be a bit a bit bit bit oh what's the
final clock speed that they'll use blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah active
blah blah blah memory latency etc etc
okay big little design here we go here
we go woo so Geekbench for single core
performance snapdragon 845 got
absolutely
first by the 9810 how very interesting
last generation etc etc okay again
oh wait that's still Geekbench for us it
splits no PC mark work 2.0 so the 9810
does not crush the snapdragon 845 here
where is it yep there it snaps making a
45s right up on the top but basically oh
thank you for that okay what seems very
clear something's wrong Oh
No Oh Luke was plugging in my power did
I actually not make it almost got it by
like milliseconds almost got it oh man
oh that was great
good I know it's fine they can't see it
um okay
oh man okay so clearly there's something
kind of wrong and basically the writer
checked in with Samsung here we go I did
get confirmation okay here we go Samsung
spokesman confirmed that the demo unit
was running special firmware for Mobile
World Conference so these results
because you can clearly see they're
totally bummed up because the PC mark
score has the Exynos 9810 getting
creamed by even the last generation
Exynos yeah last generation Snapdragon
and of course current generation
Snapdragon so clearly something's wrong
here so confirmation that the demo units
were running a special firmware and they
might not be optimized he's having a
hard time believing they would so
drastically limit the performance of the
device for show units honestly I don't
find that that hard to believe
all kinds of games get played with the
phone firmware for shows and even for
reviewers but check this out did get
confirmation that samsung is planning to
tune down the Exynos variant to match
Snapdragon performance Wow
so I'm actually not sure how that wasn't
bigger news because I can see a lot of
different ways that people can get upset
about this and I can't see a lot of ways
where people wouldn't be a little
upset about this so the two ways I can
see people being upset upset number one
would be if I got a snapdragon 845
galaxy s nine because there's always
controversy there yeah and with Apple it
was even so what was it a ten was the
first one they did it on where they dual
sourced from TSMC and and then one of
them was better than yeah one of them
was arguably sometimes better than the
other and it was mostly in terms of
battery life where people were getting
upset because one of them was a little
bit more power efficient but it was
close enough I was things within 5% like
it was close enough that you were also
playing around with the variations in
battery capacity at that point so I can
see people being upset about getting the
perceived trashy err chip the other
thing I could PC people being upset
about is if you're in the European or
Asian market and you've got an X and O's
88 95 didn't having it be nerfed and see
this is probably one of the actuation
yeah what's that Samsung this is
probably one of those situations where
Samsung realized that this these
problems could happen so they decided to
try to quietly make them the same so
that people wouldn't argue which you
know from a certain standpoint I kind of
understand they're like we just don't
want people to freak out so if we make
everything the same that it's great but
then people are gonna freak out because
then they should have gotten an
advantage is this San Siro is this
Samsung kind of going well you know the
Canadian region probably won't care
about this phone until such time as it's
available through Canadian carriers so
let's just not bother briefing them like
is this them going you know what you
know outside of the US Americans
probably don't read you know
non-american news outlets so they're
probably not gonna like look that
closely at the Exynos version so like as
long as we seed all the US outlets with
snapdragon ones should be fine like are
they is this them going okay as long as
we keep it contained within a region
then no one will figure this out and you
know the mainstream consumer probably
wouldn't is that what's happening here
Wow I think
okay so I think it's been proven many
many many times that nerds are gonna
figure it out
mainstream consumer no mainstream the
consumer is not gonna care there's an
iterative number they're gonna see
that's the s9 and they'll want it if
they're getting a new phone for whatever
reason okay I've got a lot of people
asking this and we really need to we
really need to address it I can't find
the first person who asked it but let's
let's go down to this one who was it
okay whatever the question is why here
we go
der Fuehrer 123 ah seriously
why doesn't Samsung use Exynos in the US
and China and then another person asked
why does Samsung a not a designer and
fabricator of mobile CPUs I use there
why do they use Paul comm CPUs in their
phones and the answer is actually a
little more interesting than you might
at first think there was a different
word I was looking for and I'm know it
was like delicate and but it wasn't
delicate it's a little more subtle a
little more whatever I forget so the
reason we read junk I'll say Radio
compatibility is actually one factor but
Samsung could probably figure out how to
support more bands with their chipset if
they really pretty sure they wanted to
hard enough but one wants nuance thank
you that's them know those the check oh
thank you chat nuance I just I read it
in channels like absolutely so there are
business reasons for doing it so first
of all within samsung's different
business units like for example their
fabrication unit that also as you guys
probably know builds RAM or NAND flash
or even processors for competitors
within Samsung's different business
units I have it on fairly good authority
that Samsung unit a won't actually get a
discount compared to the open market
from Samsung unit B so if Samsung Mobile
wants to
by NAND flash for their phones for
storage they don't get like a discount
compared to if Apple we're buying it
it's all down to that business unit the
the fabrication business unit needing to
make the best profits they can and
negotiating deals based on volume based
on capacity based on all the things that
they would normally do so there's one
reason why Samsung Mobile might not be
married to Exynos chips reason number
two is that building a CPU is really
hard
every time look at Snapdragon 810 even
Qualcomm who has been other than Apple
basically the undisputed leader for a
lot of the last few years can really
screw it up sometimes so if Samsung were
to just say AHA for our note and s line
up we are not going to use your top tier
chips we're gonna stop marketing
Qualcomm technology being good we're
gonna we're gonna we're gonna burn this
bridge because we can make our own CPUs
that if Samsung were to do that and then
flub up a generation or two generations
of chips they could put their Galaxy S
or no products at a significant
disadvantage compared to the LG's and
HTC's of the world guys who didn't
invest in that fabrication technology
but also aren't taking that risk so
Samsung is dual sourcing not just to
make up fabric fab capacity which as far
as we can tell us why Apple does it also
to play the different fabricators
against each other
oh yeah that's another reason so that
they can play Samsung's own business
unit against external ones where was I
going with this right so there's also a
business reason for dual sourcing not
just to make up fab capacity but also to
hedge your bets
so Samsung has the ability to ramp up
and do X in US and more regions if you
know Qualcomm chips are dead again but
they can also cover for their own dud in
the event that wall comes technology is
significant
you join and Samsung they can't really
okay I'm what Hunter said certain they
can't afford it but I'm gonna say in
this immediately they're also legally
required to use their chips in their
phones it's a 25 year old agreement
weird so that's another one but but
having another big launch failure will
be really bad this close to their phone
bombs remember to Samsung could also
just use Qualcomm chips in their lower
end stuff it's not like Samsung doesn't
have a bazillion models of phones yeah
but why they might do it on within a
single model there's a lot of reasons so
there's that and then there's all the
other stuff that we're talking about as
well
all right apparently also Qualcomm CDMA
patent and licensing so until CDMA goes
away they'll just basically be forced to
but with all of that said I have an X in
O's Galaxy s8 it works fine in the
States but it just might not work on all
carriers so it wouldn't work on Springs
who else is still CDMA CDMA will be
going away sometime in the next little
bit it can't be that many carriers
though I don't think it's that mean I
don't know who used the CDMA still who
in Canada ah Bell did until recently I
don't know if they do anymore they might
be just some now yeah I don't I don't
pay that close attention so 18 really
they're all still using it Sprint
Verizon and US Cellular I didn't know
Verizon was still using CDMA AT&amp;amp;T Mobile
or GSM hmm fun according to Google
anyway and then apparently Bell Mobility
in Ontario Quebec is still CDMA Oh tell
us the CDMA here there you go
interesting but we don't know
necessarily that they're only using it
yeah so yeah again I don't pay that
close attention to that stuff because
I'm just not that big of a cellphone
nerd if I'm gonna be honest with you
guys uh what else do we have for news oh
I don't know I'm just go drop it with a
doc for no reason
happens once a show really bad timing I
don't know why it does that
perfect celebrate is now advertising
they can break the security of iOS 11
including the iPhone 10 for pretty cheap
too
articles from Forbes now do you have to
have the phone physically in their
possession yep so you'd have to ship it
to them and apparently it can cost as
little as fifteen hundred dollars per
unlock their service to determine or
disable determine or disable that's a
big difference actually because
determining if you get someone's phone
temporarily when they lost it and you
ship it off and get their PIN and then
get it back and get whatever you want
and then be like oh my god I found your
phone yeah not great yeah they can
determine or disable the pin pattern
password screen locks or pass codes on
the latest Apple iOS and Google Android
devices yeah brutal so we have to take
this with the claim of with a grain of
salt because celebrates business is
breaking security of devices for like
forensic data analysis so you know they
might just be looking for some free
press but it seems like it would be sort
of a bad move to put out something
that's designed to get you a bunch of
free press and then anytime anyone
contacts you about you can't actually do
it yeah so they haven't even publicly
announced it but apparently they're
advertising the capability to their
customers so it sounds pretty credible
yeah it can determine or disable the pin
the pattern the password screen locks or
pass codes on the latest devices Wow Wow
pretty brutal not a fan of this really
that's pretty much it actually is there
like anything else that happened this
week that like is super important we
don't have anything else in the doc
because James has been busy on a really
cool project have you even seen this yet
no like you're so out of touch these
days Wow so we built um your son in
tennis why don't we play I'll play I'll
lose but I've been down I'm done
I'll get rekt but it sounds entertaining
anyway it's a cool product so I was kind
of inspired by the tape deck that we
have in our house for some reason and
you know how you use
used to be oppressed like a physical
button like a mechanical button to kind
of to switch things so I was like you
know what be really cool a gaming setup
where you've got like a tactile button
for switching between your different
devices different devices yeah so cuz
you know PC gaming is not the only kind
of gaming
yeah so James and Anthony collaborated
we didn't actually end up with as cool
buttons as I'd hoped
they're like vandal resistant switches
unfortunately but but what is cool is
that I wanted to work like an RGB
element into it so they built a desk not
quite scratch built but like use the
Ikea desk builder then modified it quite
heavily that has a bunch of circuitry in
the top including a an Arduino and an
HDMI switcher so that what you can do is
there's three RGB color coded lights on
the front for the three gaming systems
that are in shelves working their way
down along down one side yeah and then
when you so when you press the red one
it does the top and then the RGB
lighting in the drawer illuminates and
the input switches on your monitor this
legit sounds like a sellable so you're
on your PC thing then you press the
second button the RGB lighting
illuminates matching the button the
middle one and you switch to your Xbox
press the third one you switch to your
PlayStation 4 Pro that's really cool
pretty cool right you guys should figure
out how to sell this as a kit it's
connect janky still it would require
significant further development to make
it ready for primetime I'll be so cool
though but you know we okay so we know a
lot of other guys out there have been
doing like setups for a while yeah and
so for us you know we we've had some
ideas for setups like you saw the
projector one right with the processor
built into the Dow's very cool yeah so
we've had some ideas for setups but like
we really wanted to find a way to make
sure that what we're doing is different
from what anyone else is doing so that
was where the idea of projector built
into your desk or like a physical button
to switch inputs between your different
gaming systems came from and I
like it I think this is something that
we're gonna continue to do and you know
I'd love to see people's ideas if you
want to post them on the forum I am
actually fairly active over there yeah I
don't post a lot but I do read a lot
yeah yeah I really I'm really happy with
it alright so I think that's pretty much
it
cool we have a ton of people know that
yeah viewing - we've got like six
thousand viewers and then we've got a
bunch of people cheering oh this is a
new thing oh yeah so it used to just
show the top cheer like ever yeah now it
shows the weekly top Cheers
and it like totals there Cheers so like
this dude I'm a broke dude who's
hilarious hilariously number one tear
right now that's why you're broke yeah
then maybe you stop that if he talks in
chat if any of these top three talked in
chat they have a little metal next to
the name and Hisle show one his will
show a - and be silver his Oh show three
and be bronze and then the one guys got
it okay new it's a new thing apparently
there was there look oh I'm a broke dude
shows one right next to him on a gold
medal
oh no there was other news ah the Xbox
one x and the Xbox one s are getting
1440p support so that's dope what yeah
that already be there
no they supported 1080 in 4k oh and so
now if you don't care about 4k which you
probably shouldn't because you're gaming
on a TV um oh so you can tell it oh okay
okay cool right I see what you mean now
that's very cool actually yeah okay I'm
totally on board now apparently first I
was like what the heck
apparently there was a Nintendo switch
news I don't know what it was what
no no okay you can use a PlayStation 4
controller that's an article that I saw
earlier that was gonna meet anyway I
think the 1s and the 1x supporting 1440p
is a way bigger deal because if you use
a console at like in a dorm or whatever
you probably don't have a 4k TV I
probably don't have a TV at all you
probably have your desk which if you're
smart has like a big monitor so you can
use that as a monitor and as a TV you're
smart and you're a baller although
they're not that expensive these days
especially like compared to a TV anyway
this point is a big monitor will
probably be 1440p if you don't want to
spend a whole bunch of money for 4k and
anything if there's big screens in dorms
at all
they're probably TVs and they're
probably real old right okay so fine if
you're a baller student you can get one
of those Korean 1440p monitors on eBay
you can hook that up to your PC and now
to your Xbox and you can get better
image quality we know about the github
thing github got nailed by a massive
DDoS and they recovered real quick
good job github there we go yeah it was
huge though it's a gigantic DDoS but
yeah they recovered quite quickly good
job github see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
bye
slow mo from madrenas like yeah we're
already past the 300 so um yeah good
think you see does the greatest do does
no no that's just someone we have the
best DDoS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
