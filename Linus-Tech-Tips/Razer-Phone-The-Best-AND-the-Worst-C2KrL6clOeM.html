a no compromises mobile experience for
the most discerning of consumers or is
it a mediocre expensive product that
hides its flaws behind flashy marketing
and an eye-catching industrial design
maybe just maybe it can be a little bit
of both
today's video is brought to you by
Sennheiser
their PXE 550 wireless headphones
feature up to 30 hours of battery life

cancellation and more learn more at the

the razor phone both on paper and in
practice is one of the fastest mobile
devices on the market with highlight
specifications including a totally
insane snapdragon 835 processor through
the insane performance and insane eight
gigabytes of RAM and an adrenal 540 GPU
that I think could only be described as
insane all right okay razor so back on
earth none of those things would
actually get you strapped into a
straitjacket and in fact all of them can
be found on the cheaper one plus 5 T so
I guess it's my job then to help the
average consumer differentiate between
your phones totally normal features and
it standout ones that's fine the first
thing they did well was cooling razor is
a long way away from being able to
design and/or fabricate its own mobile
processors like giants Apple and Samsung
do so to differentiate from competitors
all they can really do is get the most
out of the generally available parts on
the market and they did just that the
performance difference between the razor
phone and another phone is totally sane
insane performance but it's also
measurable I wouldn't personally notice
this kind of a bump in day-to-day usage
but I would never say no to free
performance the second thing they did
well is the battery in spite of razors
choice of an impressive but neither
insane nor unprecedented four thousand
milliamp hour battery they've actually
taken some flak over benchmarks like
screen on time but as someone who relies
on a more anecdotal approach to phone
battery longevity I had no problems with
it at all and even with the screen
configured to 120 Hertz the razor phone
lasted me through even the most
demanding days with lots of GPS
navigation and video watching leading us
to the third thing that razor did well
and not as well the screen the good is
that the 2560 by 1440 120 Hertz
from sharp is a total GameChanger
I already experienced this kind of
fluidity with the iPad pro but a high
refresh rate display when used with
variable refresh rate technology to keep
unnecessary screen updates from sucking
back battery while you're just staring
at a static screen not doing anything is
a pure no compromises solution it's
insane for real this time
other than some stutters now and then
that I hope Razer can continue to tune
in future firmware updates animations
and scrolling are so much smoother that
because of the additional responsiveness
you would swear that the device is more
than just marginally faster thanks to a
beefy cooling solution the bad though is
that other than the refresh rate nothing
about the screen stands out compared to
an OLED you do lose the burnin concerns
but it can't display a clock or
notifications all the time by
illuminating only the necessary pixels
compared to a more color focused LCD
it's not especially bright and this is
actually a big one for me compared to
some of the ultra wide aspect ratio
displays that are out there now the
razor phone wastes far more of its face
on bezels and on screen buttons though
maybe waste is an unfair word call
quality on the handset in particular was
pretty unexceptional but when it came to
playing games or watching movies that
wasted speaker space was an absolute
godsend now I went out of my way to
praise the pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL for
their spectacular front-facing speakers
even though it did cost us a headphone
jack and Razer is going to get the exact
same treatment here great speakers guys
wish it had a headphone jack yes
in there and the skin is actually
another highlight they're using a nearly
stock Android skin that seems to kind of
borrow from the oneplus PlayBook noting
razor added feels like bloat and their
game booster which lets you tune
performance versus battery life on a per
game basis is pretty cool so no
complaints here other than the usual
warning that comes from buying a low
volume Android phone the Expediency of
razor's software updates and how long
you can expect to get them on their
first generation product are both
unknown quantities at this time and that
isn't the only buyer beware statement
that I've got about this phone here are
a few more in no particular order one
it's not waterproof for careful people
this might not be a huge deal but ip67
ingress protection is quickly becoming
industry standard and this omission is
made worse by number two the razor
phone's ergonomics are not great I
understand why they went with this
blocky shape it's cheaper and it gives
them much more internal space for heat
pipes and batteries compared to a phone
that's similar in size on paper like the
pixel to excel but curvier but the hold
ability drawbacks compared to devices
with a more natural hand like shape are
something that stood out to me three
razor says the camera is going to
improve a lot and it might but right now
the best thing I can say about it is
that it actually is capable of capturing
decent or even pretty good pictures the
worst thing I can say about it
is that the camera app is best replaced
with a third-party one off the Play
Store the low-light performance is not
very good and that I haven't experienced
shutter lag like this in years it's just
not very competitive right now and if
all I had to go on was my knowledge of
razors long-term support of their first
gen products and how difficult the
software tuning required to get even
identical hardware up to par with Apple
and Samsung or even oneplus would be I'd
have to say I sincerely doubt that it
will get
there before work on a new snapdragon
845 based new razor phone start sucking
up all of razors dev time which brings
us to the last buyer beware price when a
new razor product comes out to its
credit the razor phone is significantly
less expensive than other top-tier
flagships like the iPhone 10 and Galaxy
Note 8 but compared to the next level
down kind of second-tier flagships like
the Galaxy s8 iPhone 8 1 + 5 t its flaws
become much harder to overlook it's a
bottom line then I'm not switching to
the razor phone but razor has still done
something been seen remarkable here that
is especially remarkable given that this
is their first attempt they've managed
to create an identity for this product
line that gets me pretty excited for
where they're gonna take it in the
future
it might not be great at everything but
it's the best at something butter smooth
gaming and that is a lot more than most
me - phone manufacturers can say
speaking of me - if you guys notice the
sexy D brand skin on our razor phone you
