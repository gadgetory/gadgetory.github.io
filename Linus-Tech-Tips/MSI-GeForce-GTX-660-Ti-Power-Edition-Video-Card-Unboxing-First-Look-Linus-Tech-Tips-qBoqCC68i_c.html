is the all-new geforce gtx 660ti and
this particular one is actually pretty
special this is MSI's power edition of
the part which features their triple
overvoltage enhanced pwm design as well
as their twin frozer for cooler which is
the as you might be able to guess fourth
iteration of their twin frozer cooler
peter froze there is a funny thing
because when I first heard of a twin
frozer cool cooler I was like oh they
spelled it wrong because it's fr o z R
and I was like like you know you were
they paying like a consultancy firm like
per character to come up with the name
for it or something and then you know I
just I kind of got used to it and at
this point I just I don't care anymore
because a Twin Frozr just basically
means it's like an awesome dual fan
cooler and so I don't worry too much
about like if it's spelled correctly or
not
so I mean that's the thing about
branding is you know like what's a
Kijiji but if you get used to it long
enough and it just doesn't really matter
anymore anyway I digress let's talk
about graphics cards so this is based on
Nvidia sgk 104 chip which are the first
time in my memory anyway is the for the
first time we're seeing the same chip
that's featured in their high-end
suit like flagship single GPU products
their dual GPU product now in an x6
something product level so this is a
mid-range card in terms of the price
point that we're gonna see well the
mid-range like still a gamer level card
but but it's it's more of like a
mainstreaming rather than an enthusiast
class card but it's using the same GPU
with the same technology as the 680 the
690 and the 670 it's got even the clock
speeds are the same actually let's say
we have clock speeds on here so
the reference cards will have the same
clock speeds as a GeForce GTX 670 with
the only difference being a 192 bit
memory bus as compared to a 256-bit
memory bus on the GTX 670 so you got two
gigs of gddr5 memory due to invidious
and innovative memory controller that
allows them to still get this nice even
2 gig number in spite of the the memory
bus which would normally have limited
them to an either 1.5 gig memory
configuration or a 3 gate memory
configuration you've also got a lot of
technology that gets carried over from
those basically everything from those
higher-end cards including GPU boost
which dynamically adjusts the GPU clock
speeds depending on the load that's
being put on the card and how much power
is being drawn from the cards so that
you're always getting the highest
performance you can in the applications
that demand it sorry I'm gonna key I'm
gonna keep going with the stuff on the
box but I want to start getting this
card open here so that you guys can
check it out because I am extremely
excited about the GeForce 660ti and
particularly the power Edition from MSI
due to their triple lumen voltage design
so here I'll let you guys sort of stare
at the board a little bit with the
slicks assistance while I talk about
some of the other technology that's
being carried over from previous edition
cards so here's a big one adaptive vsync
so adaptive vsync basically gives you
the best of both worlds when your
framerate goes above the refresh rate of
your monitor adaptive vsync will turn
vsync on which will give you which will
reduce the amount of terrible eliminate
tearing which is when you turn around
and you see half of the image was drawn
while you were looking over here and the
other half is drawn while you're looking
slightly over here so we don't quite
meet up in the middle or up here
somewhere and that's a big problem and
then what's great about adaptive vsync
is it turns it off as soon as you get at
or below the refresh rate of the monitor
so that benefit of that
is that when you have vsync on you have
to be at an even multiple of no not a
multiple divisor a factor I think it's a
factor of the refresh rate of the matter
or whatever okay that time something has
to multiply the refresh rate so you if
you're at refresh rate of 60 for your
monitor you have to run at 30fps as
opposed to 45 so it'll knock you down to
a lower frame rate so what it does is it
turns it off to prevent that from
happening so that's good stuff as well
GPU boost is amazing performance per
watt as well as class-leading
idle power consumption which to me is
one of the most important things about
it because even the most hardcore gamer
still checks facebook and email and
doesn't necessarily game all the time so
having a video card that doesn't kick
out a ton of heat and doesn't consume a
ton of power when you're not actually
playing video games is very very
important to me you can have a look at
the twin frozen cooler
well I checked my notes so you've got
full support for video 3d vision
surround running off of a single card
you've got support for TxAA so TxAA
is basically a much a much better way of
doing anti-aliasing so NVIDIA has
incorporated a variety of different
approaches to get you significantly
better image quality without necessarily
the same level of performance hit that
we've seen in the past and what TxAA
does is it offers a higher level of
quality of filtering than has previously
been achievable they're not all games
support it but like any new technology
we will eventually see it continue to
move forward FXAA is of course high
quality anti-aliasing not quite the same
as NSAA
but with a much lower performance hit
compared to a more traditional
anti-aliasing so if you don't know what
anti-aliasing is well Google is your
friend but we're gonna focus on this
this card and other aspects of it for
now so Twin Frozr for cooler lots of
different technologies so you've got
your dual fans you got your propeller
blades which with these coatings at the
end actually reduce the amount of noise
they make
as well as improve the amount of airflow
that they push due to the design of the
blade also they've added dust repellent
technology which gets the fan to spin
the opposite way the first and when it's
first turned on to pull some of the dust
out of the fins before it reverses
direction and pushes air back through
the fin so this keeps dust from settling
on the fins and means you won't have to
clean your video card as often if at all
using this technology so Twin Frozr for
cooler yeah what else what else do we
have to say about high yes super pipes
so these ones out here the peat pipes
that have to carry the heat farthest
away from the GPU out to the very edges
of the cooler those ones are using
thicker heat pipes whereas the ones that
are right over the GP itself and aren't
carrying heat very far using thinner
heat pipes that way they're using the
more expensive thicker heat pipes in the
areas where you really have to work
harder to move the heat away from the
GPU and spread it out to the radiator
which covers almost the entire card
speaking of things that cover almost the
entire cart you can see there's a yuna
sink right here instead of putting it
you know lots of gamers love back plates
so you know they see the plate that's
covering almost the entirety of the cart
including all the VRM as well as the RAM
modules and see this fold right here
this gives the card a lot of rigidity so
lots of gamers love backsides because
they can make the card look pretty slick
and sexy but there's a problem with back
plates and that is that as soon as you
add a little bit more height to the back
of the card you are reducing the
compatibility with multi-gpu
configurations a lot of the time you
take two cards of the back plate you try
and put them side-by-side and you don't
try us-ally or whatever other config you
want and you go home all of a sudden
your cards are kind of like like this
away from each other because those back
plates don't leave enough space and the
size approach is to build in this unit
sink which gives a lot of the benefits
of the back plate including cooling many
of the components you can see with their
custom PCB all the components except for
a couple memory modules or on the other
side of the card okay so you're getting
the cooling benefit besides you're
getting the active cooling from the fan
anyway if anything there should be more
benefit to doing it this way you're also
getting that extra rigidity to the card
this card has almost no flex so you get
same benefit that you'd get from a
backplate except that you're putting it
on the front and you still maintain a
very clean look and all of that good
stuff it's just a matter of where they
put that plate of metal so in terms of
physic other physicality the card pretty
much what you've come to expect I mean
it's using the same GPU most of the same
technology as a six seventy or six
eighty so you've got dual DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort out again supporting Nvidia
3d vision surround off of a single card
you've got two sli figured fingers
meaning you're gonna have support for at
least three way graphics card
configurations which is again very
unexpected for what would normally be
more of a mid-range gaming level
graphics card PCI Express 3.0 is fully
supported by this card two PCIe six pin
power connectors it's a very power
efficient card in fact I'm surprised
they even need two of them to be to be
perfectly blunt and which leads us to
the most important things about this
card so number one is something you
can't really see that well because
there's nothing on the back of the card
and this heat spreader covers all of the
PWM for the card you can't really see
anything but it uses a five plus two
phase power design compared to the four
plus two phase power design of a
reference card that means better
stability and overclocking and in theory
better better over clocks which leads us
to the single most important thing about
the power Edition and that is the fact
that it features triple over voltage
triple over voltage is MSI's sort of
branding marketing speak thing for the
ability to over volt the core the PLL
and the memory now I'm gonna let that
sink in for a second there won't be
another gtx 660ti at launch that allows
over volting the core which means that
as long as you've got decent cooling on
this card this will be the 660ti that
will overclock better than any other
card now this is only the unboxing I
haven't tested
yet and I do have a power Edition triple
overvoltage cart and I have another one
that I'm going to be testing
head-to-head to find out if there's an
actual benefit do you get higher boost
clocks from using triple / voltage
versus from not using it so I'm very
excited to check that out but I'm
confident enough that we're gonna see
the results that I'm gonna go ahead and
say it now you guys are gonna want to
use MSI Afterburner to overclock your
gtx 660ti power edition with triple over
voltage and if you want the most
performance per dollar out of a 660ti
this will be the way to go thank you for
checking out my unboxing their first
look at the six gtx 660ti power edition
from msi and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and have their computer videos
and I forgot to cover the DVI to vga
adapter to dual molex to 6-pin PCI power
connectors and a quick users guide
download of course the latest drivers
from the Nvidia website rather than
using this disc and I'll thank you for
bearing with me when I forget things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
