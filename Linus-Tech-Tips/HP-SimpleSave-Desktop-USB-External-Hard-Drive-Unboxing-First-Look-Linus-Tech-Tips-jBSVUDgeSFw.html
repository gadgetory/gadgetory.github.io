the HP simple save external hard drive
it offers instant hands-free backup
hands-free ok
it offers extra storage it functions on
USB 2.0 and this one in particular
happens to be a one terabyte drive just
plug it in that's the whole instructions
backup will automatically start in 25
seconds your computer is now backed up
yes it's that easy
wow that's cool
alright so system requirements are USB
port XP Vista or Windows 7 and what's
inside is where all we'll see that in a
moment and then here it says stores up
to 120 hours of HD video 25,000 mp3s or
2002 or 2525 250,000 mp3s or 200,000
JPEGs and let's get this thing opened up
this is a bit of a cheetah unboxing it
is oh no it is sealed huh I thought this
one wasn't sealed oh there you go it's
just the boxes kind of beat up but it is
sealed there we go
now we know you learn something every
day so let's have a look at what we've
got in terms of accessories first and
then we will have a look at the Cintas 8
unit itself so the first thing we find
is a simple same desktop alright this is
a bit of a user's guide it's quite
simple
step 1 plug in step 2 pop it
wow they really are stressing the whole
simplicity thing so you've got your
standard AC to DC adapter as well as a
USB cable and they've even got like two
different ends on it you know USB eight
a mini B just in case you were having
trouble figuring out what goes where it
should be quite apparent which end goes
into what if you want to hook up the
simple safe even for like your grandma
or you know whoever else you're trying
set help backup their stuff
just give them one of these and take
care of itself by the look of things all
right it's got a nice glossy black
finish on it which is just gorgeous and
a total fingerprint magnet you can see
how incredibly glossy that is like you
can actually see me completely looking
through my camera with my chest tripod
meal today all right at the front we
find more glossy black an HP logo and a
little simple safe and then on the other
side we find more glossy black now this
is impressive look at that Hey
HP engineers have done it again they
have invented a glossy black finish that
is okay well we've got a little bit of
fingerprint nice going on there but
that's pretty darn good for like
something this shiny look at that very
impressive you know what that might be
more impressive than their software and
the storage and the packaging and
everything else combined a glossy black
product that does not look horrible as
soon as you touch it terrific on the
back it's simple USB port power port
that's it that's the whole thing there's
no buttons this is like the antia the
anti PC product it's so simple a Mac
user could use it there's no buttons
this just it just works cool well thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
HP simple safe
it offers automatic hands-free backup I
see what they mean by hands-free like
look at this you don't even have to
touch it there's no button so we've gone
from one touch to hands-free you just
kind of wave at it and the software
works it's magic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
