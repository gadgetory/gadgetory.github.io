basis and game at LAN parties with my
friends on the weekends but now that I'm
self-employed and I have three kids I
have neither weekends nor friends so the
solution a land gaming center that I
don't have to travel to one that has
participants that I'm already paying to
hang out with me here in our office and
thanks to our sponsorship from Intel
today that dream begins to become a
reality
though clearly we do have some
all right so our not at all wild idea is
to convert this corner of our warehouse
the one that we had wired up and cooled
up for crypto mining now you can see how
well that worked out into a full-on
gaming Center something truly useful so
what we're gonna need is proper power
proper cooling proper networking and
most importantly some solid gaming rigs
so that nobody has lag as an excuse now
the purpose of this part 1 video is
twofold
we're gonna lay out the plan such as it
is at this point and we're gonna get
your feedback about it so that we can
make any necessary changes before going
all out and before even cleaning up
apparently so there's our transformer
box
there's our electrical panel so then
right about here is where we've got
outlets times 16 yeah
can we run 10g over I don't see why we
wouldn't is it too long it's expensive
so is each system gonna be 10k because
we have the capability or no I don't
know I mean those cards are only like a
hundred bucks that was sick
yeah like our caching server would not
be able to keep up but it would be sick
so basically power is gonna kind of
depend on where we want the tables we
could have Brian move the outlets if we
wanted depending on how we wanted to do
okay so here's one thing this wall is
really ugly
both the technically that wall doesn't
have to be there right they just
supporting it is supporting the
electrical panel
now we could even have like a TV there
or something like a countertop here a
countertop that would be nice just like
seeing put stuff there like as part of
our initial planning we need to design
and build up a prototype of the actual
systems that we're gonna be rolling out
because you want to make sure everything
about them is perfect before you run out
and build 16 boxes oh yeah
our plan is 16 seats anyway we want to
not only be able to game on this set up
for a long time but we'd also love to
have it available for Linus Media Group
and floatplane Media staff to stream off
hours or maybe we could start doing some
Let's Plays over on channel super-fun
resurrect that like I don't know so with
that in mind our builds were designed to
be good enough for high refresh rate
1080p or normal refresh rate like 60
Hertz 1440p gaming we haven't actually
chosen our monitors yet so we're
definitely open to your feedback on that
what do you guys think we should go with
anyway thanks to Intel sponsoring this
video
our prototype will be using their
excellent 8700 K processor which from
our recent testing is untouchable when
it comes to gaming performance the only
thing faster than this is Intel's own
limited edition a 286 K but well cannot
has 16 of those now for our boot drives
we're gonna be using Intel 760 series
nvme SSDs these are 512 gigs with read
speeds of up to 3200 and 30 megabytes
per second and then about half of out on
writes then we're gonna be using an
octane module accelerated 12 terabyte
barracuda Pro in each of our systems to
give our game drive so our entire Steam
libraries will have SSD like performance
you can actually check out our recent
video about that up here we need to
figure out how like let's say let's say
everyone comes down at the end of the
day or whatever
and wants to play the same game and we
don't have it we need a way for everyone
to be able to download the game really
quickly fashion server but if you
already have one I think we should make
a second book a second one I don't think
our VM oh come on just no way really not
like what's your performance goal but
gigabit each that's not even that
unreasonable is it yeah so we need to
ten days but there's not like a
compression overhead on the caching
server is there so we just need lots of
network lots of network ram would be
good what if it could be on a dedicated
server okay so now that makes sense and
then we just have dedicated servers
running all the time and then it can
also act as a cache yeah I want it to be
quiet that's fine so yeah we'll have to
like waters away or something
hell yeah the rest of our machine is a
solid balance of mostly - but with a
touch of flash so we chose the asus rog
Strix xiii 70g and ATX board in part
thanks to its compact size and deulim
got two slots and we went with a
matching Strix gtx 1070 not wanting to
overdo our prototype just in case nvidia
dropped a new GPU on us and we ended up
wanting to go with something else each
station we're gonna have a limited
amount of actual floor space to allocate
to each one but obviously it's better to
have the system up on top from a dust
management perspective so one way or
another not on the floor though remember
what the way into a pc look like after a
year Dreamhack
the PCs about where did you come from
so here's where we're at
towers either behind the side or on top
and not ghetto but not down here since
the systems are gonna be highly visible
we hit up our buds over at Corsair to
send us over there new to ATX micro ATX
chassis it's compact it's got tempered
glass and it's compatible with their new
IQ RGB lighting control software for
that matter
so as the Vengeance Pro RGB ran that
they sent over and in white to match
this gorgeous color scheme so right now
we have a very poorly designed fresh air
cooling system one that brings fresh air
in but has no exhaust roughly 5,000
watts they don't have 350 per and then
like what at 500 watt server yeah okay
you know what whatever 5,000 the final
components of the system are the power
supply so for this we went with an RM
650 X it doesn't have any kind of flashy
RGB or anything like that but it's got
it where it counts providing enough
power for any config that we could put
in here and it's got a modular interface
so go ahead and get that installed and
for CPU cooling we've gone with the H
100 I Pro but with a twist we took off
the Maglev fans that are included
sacrificing a little bit of performance
and swapped on light loops this cooler
zero rpm mode which can be configured in
coarse our software means that we can
actually have the system's when they're
idle be completely silent so if there's
only a couple of people gaming there
won't be any noise pollution so what I'm
proposing is we turn this area into like
console gaming zone honestly what I
would like ideally
is to kind of have two couches and I'd
like to have a big old CRT that we could
have on like a rolling cart with some
old consoles or an emulation box and
then you could have like because
realistically if you're playing more
modern games they're not that sensitive
to input like anyway so you play those
on the projector first and then you
could have a big CRT for anything else
play first-person shooter over here yeah
so here's our finished prototype rig
it's not over the top or anything but I
still think it looks really good and
because of Ike you will have
functionality like having the whole
thing turn red when someone dies or
whatever and then in terms of the layout
of the room basically this is the wall
where we want to put the projector Jake
will have to move his paint booth here's
where I want kind of like couches for
console gaming or CRT gaming here is
where we're gonna put the I don't think
we're gonna get three rows in here so I
think it's gonna end up being probably
two rows of gaming machines with the
chairs in the middle back-to-back or
something along those lines I don't know
I think three feet per person we're
gonna kind of have to make it work you
know we we really want to get a bunch of
ideas from you guys do you guys have any
ideas for monitors peripherals is there
any feature that you think we're missing
from like a networking or power or
cooling perspective we are wanting to do
this like crazy awesome so don't be
afraid to give us your wacky ideas in
