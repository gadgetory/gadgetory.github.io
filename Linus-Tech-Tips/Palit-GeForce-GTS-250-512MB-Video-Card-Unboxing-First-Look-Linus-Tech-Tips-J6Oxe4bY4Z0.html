unboxing and having a quick look at a
pallet geforce GTS 250 512 Meg video
cart and then the second thing is I'm
going to talk a little bit about NCIX is
Easter extravaganza which is going to be
running for the month of March and is
the reason for my ridiculous outfit
containing some ridiculous colors not
that I don't normally wear the hat in
particular anyway first of all why don't
we get going on the unboxing this is a
palette video card palettes big thing is
that they always have custom PCBs so
that means that they use high quality
components for all their power delivery
and they say you get better performance
out of a palette card because you get
better overclocking play it tweak it get
more out of it that's their slogan okay
this is an HDMI card it has dual link
DVI VGA and HDMI let's have a look at
the back it's in about 12 different
languages and these are all pretty much
standard feature so why don't we get
this thing open and have a look okay
here we go so we got the video card
first but why don't we have a look at
the accessories before we really get
into the video part itself so the first
thing we find is one of those little
audio cables that I'm pretty sure nobody
uses but it's included just in case then
we have a two molex to one PCI Express
power adapter so I'm going to go out on
a limb and assume that this card needs
an external PCI Express power connector
then we have a quick installation guide
which I'm just gonna look at myself here
shows you how to install the drivers it
does not include any installation
instructions for the hardware aspects of
things and I mean really these
instructions are mostly irrelevant
anyway because you shouldn't be using
the included driver CD you should be
downloading the latest drivers often
video.com so why don't I put this back
inside here and let's get this video
card out of the box just finished
watching the men's hockey game where
they totally won so I'm just still here
in front of the TV that's why I'm kind
of in
weird location today anyway here's the
palette video card so on the top you
find a custom fan and heatsink
combination which is very very standard
even though it's a non-standard heat
sink for a pallet video card because
they do all use custom PCBs and coolers
on the back we're going to find HDMI VGA
and DVI as advertised then we have an
arrow slot we have a slotted cooler here
so that means that although this isn't a
blower style heatsink you can see that
the air can be exhausted in all
directions we are going to lose a little
bit of the heat on the back of the case
via these vents this is a standard PCI
Express oh this is weird this is a GTS
250 but it doesn't have an SLI an SLI
connector look at that there's no SL
like I was about to say it's got your
standard SLI connector and PCI Express
16x interface but it only has one of
them that's funny I need GTS 250 can run
in SLI mode without a connector and
performance probably isn't going to be
impacted much but that's still a very
strange thing to see on the on the card
of this caliber anyway okay why don't we
come around to the back and we see some
of the power delivery there you can see
it's covered in a giant heatsink that
covers most of the video card I'll try
and get you a better view of that in a
minute and then we have our PCI Express
6x power connector right here you have
the power for the fan alright and then
I'm going to try and give you a better
angle on the heatsink camera person I
think you can tell me if you've got a
good good angle there can you kind of
see it okay so the heatsink covers this
much of the video card right here and
it's just aluminum fins being blown down
on by this fan alright if you have a
look here you can see that the memory is
arranged kind of strangely like it's
some kind of all bunched in together
here and then it kind of it goes it's in
this sort of a pattern like the old
sixty eight hundred and seventy eight
hundred series cards and it's 512 megs
overall on this particular video card I
wish I could show you more of it but I
mean that's all I can really do so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the palette GTS 250 512
Meg
and then the code word is eggplant and
if you check out the NCIX
Easter extravaganza on NCI XCOM then you
will know why you need the codeword
eggplant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
