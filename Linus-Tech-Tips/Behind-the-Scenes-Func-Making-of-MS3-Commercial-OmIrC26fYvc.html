big shoot here's our sandbags which are
of course very exciting so we're taking
my car and B rolls to the shoot and of
course you can't see a thing because I
fixed everything inside we have hurry up
we have the knife they arrived in time
oh you're actually doing your
documentary stuff that's good good works
like yeah this is a personal invitation
as we're unboxing boxes yeah so here's
our makeup kit I've never seen this much
makeup before in my life like
Mastercraft
makeup I guess it's just a Mastercraft
box
fancy external monitor
packing up some monitors it's a good
thing your boxers are higher than nice
if they weren't higher so we've got our
art designers here doing of course all
of their preparation the night before
like a prototype of BMS 3 which has been
significantly modified over the stock
version because we really felt that
gamers needed more buttons so we've
added a full set of arrow keys and f5
for quickly refreshing your favourite
websites print screen pause because
sometimes you just need a break and
control for maximum control of the mouse
also over on the left instead of the the
usual three buttons that you'll find on
most ms3 as our prototype has seven
buttons on the side and in order to get
data to them we had to actually add this
wire right here which we thought should
be fine because it acts as a support
brace for controlling the rear mouse
wheel in addition to the top and mouse
wheel we also added an additional button
here so normally there are just three
here and the middle click but we added
sort of three more and we needed some
more circuitry to power those as well so
this is this is what we ended up with
this is what we think gamers actually
want is more buttons but
we want dentistry to be an extension of
the gamer and it was gross awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
