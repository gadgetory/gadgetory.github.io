look on - tech tips and in this one I'm
going to try and throw something up and
catch it behind my back oh yes okay goes
to show you nerds can be athletic dude
at any rate this unboxing is something
that I had to buy for myself because I
had to take a part in SSD and some other
random stuff this is the I fix it pro
toolkit and unlike buying the one
screwdriver that I actually needed
individually on eBay which was going to
cost me like 15 bucks with shipping this
one cost me here we go
75 bucks with shipping and includes a
bunch of different stuff that's that's
very very handy so the dangers of
disposable furniture I think this is
basically just that eblasts
take a bite illegally Addison who cares
okay so use this coupon code for five
dollars off your neck okay well I guess
someone gets my coupon code although
this looks pretty generic so I think
everyone gets a coupon code so this is
the iFixit Pro Tech tool kit which
includes sort of weird and hard to find
tools and screwdrivers and stuff like
that for text who want to be able to do
things so you've got some I don't know I
didn't even look at everything it
includes so little plastic apple removal
junk for taking apart things like
iPhones and iPads and pry bars and
things like that as well as what appears
to be tweezers for grabbing stuff I
wouldn't have minded seeing one of those
pickle grabbers in here because those
are friggin awesome here's another pair
of tweezers okay presumably also for
grabbing stuff another pair of tweezers
presumably also for grabbing stuff
that's around something right you neat
grab stuff plus it's tough get it up
okay flat tweezers for grabbing stuff
that's harder to grab with a point you
get you get you okay these are all handy
things what's in here
like I said I really didn't look that
closely blue suction cup like taking
things apart anti-static wrist strap
okay so you can actually put that either
around your wrist or your ankle see that
makes contact with your skin and then
this goes to something that's presumably
attached to a ground so you'd either
you'd stick a wire into like an outlet
and then not okay yeah okay okay don't
just stick a wire into an outlet okay
the ground pin of an outfit then you can
put that on it or you could even just
put it to something large metal like the
back of a power supply for example or
even a case would be fine and then you
are grounded all the time by your
parents presumably because I can't think
as well sleep grounded okay moving right
along
we've got more plastic little bits and
pieces so we got a point on that end and
some kind of hook or something on that
end okay cool and we have two spatulas
there we are okay some more spatulas and
more of like a flat sort of feather
shaped guy that made a metal a metal
feather that's what we call it okay and
then some more spatulas one sharp one
dull and you a measurer
Hey look at that that one goes in your
pocket so you can put that right in your
pocket right there and I'll stay right
there for you also includes if you can't
fix it you don't own it okay that's
interesting repair is better than
recycling and saves the planet and all
this good stuff this looks like unit
conversions very very cool so inches - I
don't know maybe it isn't in your
conversions doesn't matter anymore I'm
putting it away alright finally the part
that I actually needed which wasn't any
of that stuff which is the iFixit 54 bit
driver kit which has a bunch of pull out
that hurt jammed my gem my thumb there
startled me a little bit which has a
bunch of stuff that can be useful so I
hope it has a try wing because I really
need to fix my D s as well but here
they're all labeled so you've got all
kinds of different really really tiny
Phillips and stuff like that okay 3.5
4.0 slots the seriously I don't know I
don't know if I can say that word
becoming an offensive unboxing okay tiny
tiny little size one slot sum here we go
torques so you never know when you're
going to run into security torques with
the hole in the middle so those are for
some of those difficult to remove things
some more security torques there's that
try wing so there's just three prongs on
it otherwise it looks kind of like a
Phillips head whew pentalobe there we go
that's the one I need to take apart that
SSD two five and six sighs pentalobe so
that's a star shape alright then we've
got let's at that looks like is that
like Ellen key or something except it
goes on a screwed I don't know what that
is I don't need that one I already found
everything I need ooh more security bits
oh wait no those are just sockets
nevermind not security bits okay can you
tell that I bought this without knowing
what it was looks like an extension for
the screwdriver itself and then we've
got snice look at that that's a falling
a precision screwdriver so there's the
rotating top just like all precision
screwdrivers rubber here so that you can
actually get some grip on it and torque
things a little bit and then you've got
a spot to put the bits right a boat yeah
so if you wanted to say for example put
this bit in which looks pretty similar
on both ends actually then you could do
something like that it's magnetic which
all good precision screwdrivers or
really any screwdrivers should be and
then finally oh no way it has one of
these cool so this is a flexible doodad
so you can actually get around things
like this and you can screw something in
from an angle so you can see even though
this is turn I can still see that I can
still turn the screw very very very cool
stuff right there so that is pretty much
it that is the iFixit pro Tek
screwdriver and other more random
different tools kits thank you for
