know these rollover advertisements
before the video actually starts playing
the ones where it plays for about what
10-15 seconds personally I find them
incredibly obnoxious and I had vowed to
never introduced them on my channel
however it's come to my attention that
they do generate significantly more ad
revenues so I'm going to leave it up to
my viewer base to decide whether I
should enable them or not now for
starters minus tech tips videos are not
a for-profit enterprise I have a real
job this is my office feel free to pan
around check out my office actually I
have some really weird stuff in my
office right now including a old pc
mouse cage some badminton shoes actually
yeah my office is like epic right now I
got I got a little Supreme Commander
poster yeah yeah okay so anyway this is
not a for-profit enterprise so the
Adsense revenue actually goes towards
things like giveaways contests more
products to unbox more videos that I can
produce because I have a bigger budget
so what I want you guys to do is I want
you to either click like or dislike
that's going to be how I'm going to run
this poll and after a couple weeks or
however long I'll pretty much
arbitrarily decide I'm going to look at
the video and I'm going to go okay if
the likes outweigh the dislikes then you
guys want me to have a bigger budget for
tech tips at the cost of having those
rollovers if the dislikes outweigh the
likes then you guys would prefer I do
not introduce rollovers and I will
respect your wishes and I will just have
a slightly smaller detectives budget so
vote up or vote down</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
