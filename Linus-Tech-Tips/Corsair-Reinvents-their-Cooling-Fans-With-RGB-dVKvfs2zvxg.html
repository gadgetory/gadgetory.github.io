2016 is brought to you by the Corsair
lab dog the gaming center that allows
you to use a full-size keyboard and
mouse from your couch and by MSI so
normally in the Corsair suite they're
like oh yeah we've got like these fan
things for showing and I'm like fan but
this year is a little different they
actually have five new fans that they're
showing off some of which are more about
the showing off and some of which are
actually more about the performance
which both are interesting but I think
you guys know where I'm going to be
headed and more excited about let's do
the showy stuff first though this right
here is the HD 120 RGB it uses the same
blade design as the existing SP LED but
the frame design has been updated thank
freaking everyone is George here thank
you George for stopping arguing with me
about this because I've been asking for
years for them to do away with that
round frame that doesn't seal properly
against radiators and has finally been
done so you've got the rubber grommets a
little bit on the inside and you've got
a more square frame design that should
allow these to perform well in pretty
much any scenario but it's not about
necessarily the performance here on
these ones it's about this little puppy
right here so this controller on the
side allows you to cycle the fan speed
it allows you to cycle the LED lighting
mode and it allows you to cycle the
colors depending on what kind of a
fireworks show you want going on in your
case it's available in three different
SKUs a fan a fan and a controller and a
hub and three fans a controller and a
hub because the fans themselves don't
while they work you can cool things with
them but they don't work in terms of
lighting without this lighting
controller module right here and then
the hob allows you to use a single
lighting controller module to control up
to six fans at a time personally I'd
love to see this integrated into
something like Corsair link in the
future or whatever they're calling q
thank you whatever they're calling their
other one but this is a great start and
if you're into your case looking like
you know nightclub then this looks like
pretty much the way to do it
I actually personally like the SP 120
RGB non HD version a little bit better
it doesn't allow you to have all the
like crazy disco lighting effects around
it it's just an RGB LED fan but between
the frosted blades and the actual
illumination from the hub itself I think
they've got a really really nice look to
it it uses the same controller allowing
you to change the color as well as the
mode so you can cycle through colors you
can breathe whatever else the case may
be
and it runs at a lower rpm which for me
is personally a little more appealing so
this guy is 1800 and this one I think
1400 something along those lines but
both of these are still using that SP
LED fan blade design not a redesigned
fan blade let's move on this is where
Corsair got my attention this is their
new ML series and I know I said there
were five fans and I've only showed four
so far one of them they're actually not
showing it's a super basic ML series
that doesn't have the rubber grommets
and it doesn't have the replaceable you
know color corners or anything like that
that one I would speculate is going to
end up on there all in one liquid
coolers or something like that in the
future because this is all about
performance so they're using a maglev
bearing that is about as good as it gets
to have no contact in the bearing itself
very freakin cool and they're using a
completely new blade design that's like
an all-rounder now I've talked a lot
about SP versus AF static pressure
versus airflow and in theory and this is
true of anyone who's tried to
differentiate their fans in this way
including guys like Noctua with their s
versus their NF series the problem with
an airflow optimized fan is that it's
great and it's a great idea but there's
really nowhere in a computer that you're
not going to have a guerrilla fan filter
or radiator or a heatsink so having
something that's optimized for static
pressure mostly but also delivers good
airflow is probably the way forward and
it looks like Corsair agrees so they're
using that same more square frame design
they're using an all rounder fan blade
design they're using a fantastic
barring and they claim and they're
mostly trustworthy guys and I know they
have like the Hadron Collider as I call
it they've got like a fifty thousand
dollar fan testing machine so they're
claiming across its massive controllable
rpm range this puppy goes from 400 to
2400 rpm and this guy goes from 400 to
2,000 rpm that is within 1% of what you
guys probably know is my favorite fan at
the moment and if you cherry pick
certain rpms and you compare them at a
decibel per CFM sort of scenario as much
as 17% better which is a pretty darn
that's a bold claim
I don't we don't we just say that so
it's available in three different
flavors the plain-jane one I mentioned
before the slightly less plain-jane one
right here which has interchangeable
corners but no LED lighting all the way
up to yes my friends it's Corsair so of
course it's going to have to have LEDs
all over it but not actually RGB
surprisingly although that won't
surprise you when I tell you the prices
so there's the ml there's the ML Pro
which is right here and then there's the
ML Pro LED and they are not going to be
cheap so for the pro we're going to be
looking at 25 bucks for a 120 mil $28
for a 140 ml and then for the RGB
version we're looking at $28 for a 120
mil all the way up to 33 dollars for a
one 40 mil but if you're building a no
compromises rig well I guess that's
pretty much what you're going to be
stuck with the colors you see here are
the colors that will be available and as
far as changing out the available corner
colors I'd love to see more in the
future like maybe oh I don't know say
orange but of course there hasn't
commented on any of that thanks once
again to Corsair and MSI for allowing us
to be here at Computex this year you can
check out more about the Corsair a lap
dog that I mentioned at the beginning of
the video at the link in the video
description and don't miss and don't
miss also linked below MSI's Aegis
desktop as well as their GT X 1080
lineup which we'll be covering
later on this week make sure you
subscribe to Linus tech tip so you don't
miss any Computex 2016 coverage and I
will see you guys at the next booth and
hopefully I don't lose my voice is
actually not too bad considering how bad
it was earlier this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
