physio series is going to be the extreme
which as you may guess based on the size
of the box and the name is the highest
end product in the official lineup it's
also classified as a less than 18
decibel cooler and it is geared to be a
silent cpu cooler so they've got logos
on here for every processor under the
Sun including anything on socket am-2
a.m. 3775 LGA 1156 as well as LGA 1366
in fact they've even got a core i9 logo
on there that's kind of funny
considering that Intel off scrap that
branding a little while back I guess
they design this back when it looked
like Intel was going to make a core i9
brand the heatsink requires a case with
adequate space to fit properly checked
ensure you have oh this is important
okay so if you're thinking of installing
this one check these numbers to make
sure it will fit in your system here's
the overall specifications as well as
the compatibility like I said pretty
much everything so core i9 is what they
were going to call the core i7 extreme
6-quart but then they did not end up
doing that all right oh I was huh I had
the box backwards look at that you can
actually see into the box and you can
see the overall shape of this cooler
he's got the quietest noise levels
greatest efficiency and superior
performance designed for gamers and
overclockers and those seeking extreme
performance or just those who are hit by
this heat wave that seems to be hitting
the entire continent this summer so
we've got five effective eight
millimeter heat pipes wow those are big
and those all directly interface with
the cpu core so those are going right on
the cpu heat spreader you can expect
cylonix heat sinks to offer maximum
thermal efficiency at all times they've
got optimized fan blades so it means it
is using a solid and X fan which you
would expect it has a universal mounting
system which I had a look at in much
closer detail on the compact unboxing so
I'll probably look at it quite as
closely on this one let's go ahead and
get this open and see what we have
inside so the first thing we find inside
is a box very exciting box it's light
and inside the box we will find likely a
bunch of nothing here okay nothing else
this is it okay so it's pretty much
exactly the same accessory package that
week at home
compact so yeah I probably really don't
look all that closely at this but I will
have a quick look so we've bought a fan
speed controller okay very high quality
run it actually uses before the only
good then we have a universal backplate
those four am too am 375 1156 1366 we
have the AMD mounting hardware and then
we have the Intel mounting hardware
they've also included some extra fan
mounting grommets volatile thermal
compound so the fan mounting grommets
are so you can install an additional fan
in a push-pull configuration on this
particular heatsink alright so once
again we see are greeted with a non
silvery fan so this is a silent expand
but not from there I extreme a series
and they've actually oh I hope you got
some sex oh maybe they do yes yeah well
there are two sets of 10 Robinson this
one in the compact it was actually the
fan was mounted forming already so I'm
going to have to go ahead and figure out
how to melt the fan on camera here for
you that should be quite an ordeal oh
here's a little double-sided velcro
thing to note your fan controller
somewhere in your case okay so what we
do is first let's take the heat sink oh
that's a heavy sucker alright so we go
ahead and slide that in there okay there
we go it's in there and then we go ahead
and slide this in the bottom you'll
actually like the look of this heat sink
overall it looks looks very very sharp
it's got nice shiny heat pipes it's got
a nice finish to the top of it you can
see that the act of the metal of the
aluminum fins actually have a bit of a
bump lee texture to the men i'll show
you that a little bit more closely once
i'm finished mounting the fan here as
far as fan mounting systems go this is
actually pretty clever because it
doesn't involve any clips which can be
extremely unwieldly and are difficult to
you know this is something that you
never consider either is like yeah what
if i do want to mount a second fan in
push-pull but i want to do it later so
you have to actually like keep those
clips somewhere and not lose them
whereas if it's just a couple little
rubber grommets it's no big deal so you
just line up the rubber grommets and
there
and in there i'm not paying attention to
where the camera is looking right now
because i'm actually paying attention to
where the heat sink is positioned right
now and then i'm going to go ahead and
line up the very last one so okay so
this isn't the easiest thing in the
world but i think most of the difficulty
is the fact that i'm trying to operate a
camera at the same time i think if i had
a cameraman today that that would make
my life a lot easier maybe might not my
life widened years or certainly this
video okay so you go ahead and pull
these through just give them a good tug
and then i guess if you want to you can
run them through the second hole not
Halle let me see if I can figure this
out okay hold on maybe I just have to
pull harder remember when in doubt force
it yes there we go so then if you want
to you can run it through the second
hole but that's not entirely necessary
you just want to heave on it until it
comes through there we go that was
pretty easy and I'm sorry you'll have to
bear with me because I am OCD and I do
need to put those through or else my day
will be ruined yes I said it ruined
three come on go through thank you and
last one if only I had a cat here to
help me oh yeah this is a lot easier if
you just actually pull them through one
at a time because there's quite a bit of
give and the one that's in the ones that
you've already put on so you can
actually pull this away to the lineup
the last one even when three are already
in so go ahead pull that through and
bring it through the second hole and
there we go that didn't take so long
maybe might have taken longer to just
sitting watching me do it okay so we've
got a little bit of a gap not as much of
a gap as we saw on the compact cooler
but there's a slight gap on the side
there's a bit more of a gap on the top
and the bottom so we're going to see a
little bit of airflow leakage there in
all likelihood but it shouldn't impact
performance too much most of the coolers
on the market
do have a similar sort of configuration
now this is one thing that I really like
about this cooler right off the bat and
that's the fact that all of the heat
pipes line up with the part of the
cooling tower that is going to see the
most airflow so you can see through here
okay so you see where the blades of the
fan actually start around here that's
where the dead zone is in the middle
where there's no air flow because that's
where the hub of the fan is and then the
blades of the fan actually blow air
through an area kind of this shape so
they position most of the heat pipe
cooling where it's actually going to
take advantage of the blades of the fan
now it's quite a dense heap I fin
arrangement so that means that you would
benefit for sure from putting an
additional fan on here but it's not to
to to do dance I've seen worse in fact i
think the compact one was even a little
bit more dense than this one but i could
be mistaken now something that I said
I'd look at in more close detail later
is the slightly here that slightly
textured finish on each of these
aluminum fins and the reason for that is
it gives them just a little bit more
surface area when the air is blowing
through and you're gonna sacrifice a
little bit of noise performance although
you probably wouldn't even be able to
measure it because these are such small
dimples but you'll get a little bit more
air turbulence in there and you will get
a little bit more surface area and
therefore a little bit more cooling
performance out of a design like that
last thing I want to have a look at now
I suspect this would perform really well
on an AMD cpu because they have those
nice big heat spreaders same with an LGA
1366 because it's the same thing nice
big heat spreaders but we've got five
huge eight millimeter heat pipes you
really can't ask for more than that I
mean some guys have more heat pipes on
the cooler but they're not using eight
Mills these things are enormous so
you're going here look at how thick that
is so when you actually put a CPU on
here you're going to be completely
covering the CPU in key pipe and they've
machine the bottom of it very flat i'll
do the obligatory finger shot thing
although it really doesn't mean a whole
lot i really like the shape of the
blades and I cantrell of the fins and I
can't even really tell you why I just
think it looks kind of cool here's your
Universal hold down as well as a little
bit of additional heat sink cooling
directly on the CP
you you know it's funny it wasn't that
long ago you could cool a cpu with just
one of those and a little tiny loud fan
on it and that turned into a chipset fan
and now it's like a supplementary cooler
on a on a real heat sink anyway thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the physio extreme cpu
cooler from cylonix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
