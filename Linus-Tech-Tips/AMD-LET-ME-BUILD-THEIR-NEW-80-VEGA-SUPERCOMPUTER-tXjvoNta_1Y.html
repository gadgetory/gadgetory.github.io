center slash super computer lab at a in
these Sunnyvale headquarters where they
have got the definition of an
all-hands-on-deck project going on here
they pulled in their text and partners
from around the world even markers
corporate vice president of radio and
technologies group is getting in on the
action planning the power run for one of
the most exceptional super computer
systems ever created when it's full of
20 servers this single rack is going to
be capable of one petaflop of full
precision performance and AMD estimates
it's an estimate they're not done
building it yet that they'll be doing
this at around half the cost of a
computing solution not to mention more
than double the flops per what and how
are they doing such a thing well as
crazy as it might sound AMD is actually
letting me assemble one of the system's
so uh well imma show you guys exactly
how
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description so pretty much
everything you guys see in this room
arrived about twelve hours ago at 346 in
the morning from AMD partners like
invent X Samsung and the melon awesome
has been undergoing assembly and testing
non-stop since then so it can be
unveiled at SIGGRAPH in less than whole
week so this video is as much a
behind-the-scenes look at the hard work
that goes into the glitzy polished show
demonstrations as it is about this
system that's good I kidding we're here
for the beastly hardware so this in
front of me is what AMD and invent a car
calling rapini 47 and it's this that
allows them to cram up to 640 GPU course
that's 1280 threads if you prefer up to
40 terabytes of memory and up to 80
Radeon infant's Vega GPUs into a single
rack with some rooms for high-speed
networking like in Finnegan at a total
of about 35,000 watts of power
consumption this is about as power dense
as you would want to go with air cooling
using a rear door cooling system like
what we saw at the SMU supercomputer
recently so let's take a closer look at
it at the front you've got some storage
bays like you'd expect to find on a
server though I don't think AMD or
invent tech is expecting anybody to use
these for more than just like a basic
scratch disk and then on the back if we
reason for it because that where the 100
gigabit InfiniBand connections go that
handle job sharing
servers as well as access to high-speed
dedicated storage machines
better elsewhere on the network moving
inside at the heart of every p47 is the
brand-new and d epic server processor
this one is 32 cores on a single CPU
with a 180 watt TDP 32 cores at 180
watts but that's actually not the whole
story behind what gives
g47 it's stunning efficiency each epoch
can handle up to 2 terabytes of vdr for
memory running in an 8 channel
configuration at speeds of up to 20 666
megahertz that's great for
virtualization rendering and machine
intelligence our machines have 512 gigs
of ram each but and this is the keys
each epoch can also handle 128 PCI
Express Lanes a hundred and twenty eight
lanes so that's why a single epoch can
be hooked up to up to six or even seven
GPU with a full PCIe 16x Genting
interface dedicated to everyone without
a need for a second processor core APL X
chip and that's what's plenty of
bandwidth left over for high-speed nvme
storage or high-speed networking and all
that's critical because the real star of
the show today is the Radeon Instinct
mi-25 based on a Envy's of Vega
architecture these puppies right here
are actually responsible for the bulk of
that petaflop of processing power every
mi-25 is a full fat vega consuming 300
watts actually similar to the frontier
Edition that already exists and the RX
Vega that's coming
but unlike those it lacks video outputs
entirely and a fan since it was designed
to be installed in specialized machines
like this one where the tooling is
integrated and this is sick the entire
16 gigs of HBM to memory can be accessed
by another device on the PCI Express bus
this allows high-speed communication
between discreet Radeon insync mi-25 or
even all their PCI Express devices that
are connected to the system like even an
MD or need storage life and this is
without a proprietary connection like
and be linked and all this high-speed
communication enabled by epoch which you
can kind of think of as both a CPU and
the world's biggest PCI Express which is
at the core of a new open source
architecture that AMD is championing
called Rock'em in a nutshell the idea is
that every part of an all Andy server
system is linked an extreme speed in a
non-proprietary manner so the user can
customize and scale up their
supercomputer as they see fit
want more performance just add more rack
and while $15,000 might seem like a lot
for a p-47 when you consider that AMG's
initial estimate put them comfortably in
a position to claim better performance
per dollar for modern workloads like
financial modeling diamond science and
AI not to mention better performance for
one you can see where they're confident
about really shaking up the top 100
supercomputer list comes from
and I wish them the absolute best of
luck do you have two computers for some
reason maybe one of them PC and one of
them's Mac or Linux or whatever
well synergy lets you solve the problem
of having separate keyboards and mice
for them once and for all you can share
one Mouse and one keyboard between two
or even more computers so you'll never
get confused again
they've got basic and pro options for
synergy with a one-time payment and
features include things like clipboard
sharing between the computers dragging
and dropping files between the computers
the ability to set up hotkeys and more
use our link in the video description
and get 50% off synergy today so thanks
for checking out our video here at AMD
super computer labs and if you guys
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit the like
button to get some project you consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also down there you've got a
link to our t-shirts protest pieces like
this one as well as our community forum
where you can go and talk about all the
cool stuff you saw today</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
