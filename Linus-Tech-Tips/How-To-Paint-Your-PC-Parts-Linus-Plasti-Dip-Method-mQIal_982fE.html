corsair provides SSD like performance
and fits comfortably in your pocket
click now to learn more so welcome to
something a little bit unusual i don't
know how good the audio is going to be
in here but it is what it is I'm in the
middle of preparing for one of our
ultimate build guides and this project
kind of spiraled out of control and all
of a sudden it turned from a regular
build guide into like I'm painting stuff
so I figured I might as well do a quick
run-through of the procedure that we're
going to be using to paint the stuff in
this build so as you can see I've
already gotten started on a couple of
things
so the RAM was the first thing that I
got going on so I'm using corsair
dominator Platinum's with the the light
bars but not the windows so you can see
the way that these are going to assemble
is they're going to go on like this so
what I'm doing with these ones is I want
to spray the bars that go inside here
green so that I get a really cool green
underglow effect underneath them but
then I'm doing kind of a razor themed
build so this is going to be in the h4
40 razor Edition so this silver is going
to stand out like a bit of a sore thumb
so I also want to paint these black now
you don't want to use regular paint on
computer components because what will
happen is it'll be permanent so that
kind of sucks so instead we're going to
be using Plasti Dip so I've got three
different colors here that I need so
first of all I've got black I'll be
using this to stealth the Dominator
platinum light not the light bars rather
just the tops of the Dominator
Platinum's here and then I'll also be
using this to paint the thermal are more
on the sabre-tooth z97 mark one the
reason that I'm doing that is I couldn't
find any board that even remotely
matched the color scheme we're going for
gigabyte doesn't do they're black and
green color scheme anymore since the 87
so I figure okay well we'll do our best
with it I'm going to pull off the
thermal armor I'm going to
else that I'm going to put it make it
completely black then I'll put it back
on and then once we install our ramp
plug in our a pin plug in some graphics
cards and cover up all this stuff it
should basically look like completely
spelled blackboard I'm normal last thing
I had originally intended to do a lot
more green in this build I actually
picked up two cans of the blaze green
stuff here so I pick up a couple cans of
those and then I kind of realized that
razors each for 40 or the NZXT case
before whoever's it is really doesn't
have a lot of green it's mostly black
with little green accents so the last
thing I'll be painting is just this top
lattice on both of our r9 290 so I
pulled this off the other one already
and then I'm actually going to leave the
rest of the card
black so we're just going to have those
two green accents inside the system
along with the underglow on the ran
we're going to call that probably good
enough so without further ado here we go
so to paint all the ram from every angle
without needing to touch it and
potentially wreck it I made myself a
little thing out of a paint stirrer
stick or two I guess to paint stir
sticks so that I can space everything
out and paint all this without like
going back and doing things over again
so here we go always shake for I mention
all that noise and let's know this goes
okay
so number one done oh yeah you should
always this is just a general spray bomb
Kevin hold it upside down wait till the
paint stopped coming out every time
you're done using it to keep them those
and clean okay so they get the
sabre-tooth ready the last thing you
want to do is paint something well it's
still attached to the PCB so I'm just
going to remove the rear armor something
that I didn't realize before now is that
the screws are actually all different
here so I'm just going to kind of map
them up for myself as I go alright so
we're going to pull off the thermal
armor here so I could probably mask off
these silver things here but I'm just
going to do the whole thing black same
thing with this Asus logo because it's
in like this weird camel I'm just gonna
risk it oh yeah black that oh right now
on to the graphics card so actually
these windforce
gigabyte cards come apart really easily
all you got to do is undo six screws
from the back once again keeping very
careful track of which ones go where
actually it's not that necessary here
because what we're going to do is we are
going to unplug this bad boy then we're
going to just pop this baby off top just
like that there we go so once that's
done we can actually there you go
I'm going to put these back in so we
don't lose them while we're in the
process now is a good opportunity since
we're at this to replace the stock
thermal compound I mean they put decent
stuff on at the factory but you can
always put on something better something
like I see seven diamonds or something
like that
or I see nine eight seven just the size
of the tube and the last one here there
we go and this is come on please there
we go
this is the matching one for the other
piece that we're going to paint so the
blaze stuff doesn't go on very well if
you don't
to cope with something light so that's
why I have both a white can as well as a
green can so we're going to have to do
it probably at least three or four coats
of white maybe maybe two maybe two maybe
three and then we're going to start in
with the greens F here right I guess I I
should have mentioned one of the reasons
we're using Plasti Dip instead of
regular paint is that you can peel it
off when you're done so this is going to
be the toughest one just because I got
to hit it from so many angles but light
coats from every angle is going to be
the key so I locked the lock to the
vents open here before starting to paint
just because I can't imagine why anyone
would ever close them anyway maybe
someone can enlighten me that doesn't
end up being very light coat okay do as
I say not as I do
here's just a quick in progress so I'm
mostly done with the actual painting I
just need to put a few more coats of
green on this because yeah with the
black you couldn't see the green at all
and with the white the green is very
very light lighter than I'd hoped
based on how it looks when you really
spray a lot of it on something versus
that it's a more of an acid green than
sort of the darker green that I'd kind
of hoped for so yeah you can see these
coats are darkening it alright the RAM
is pretty much good to go though so
now's as good a time as any to clean off
that stock thermal gunk we're going to
one isopropyl alcohol for this
preferably 99% I guess it's never been
proven that 70% do a decent enough job
they put a lot of thermal compound on
these GPUs so we're going to have to
take a few runs out of here no so much
more still
now while we are replacing the thermal
compound on the GPU itself we're
actually not going to replace any of the
thermal pads for the memory or anything
if you try to put thermal compound in
there instead of the pads that are there
then what will happen is your DP u cor
will not make or rather than all of
those will not make correct contact your
GPU core will prevent them from coming
down enough in order to cool themselves
so they will overheat so you want to use
thermal pads rather than thermal
compound there so we're just going to
use some mx2 because that's what I
happen to have lying around and then
we're going to reapply this bad-boy so
we apply a bit more on a GPU than we
would on a CPU where we normally do a
uncooked grain of rice sized thing we're
going to want a bit more here just
because it's a bit bigger we're going to
do like a jumbo uncooked rice there we
go this is an incredibly important step
in the reassembly process never forget
to reconnect your fans because without
fans um yeah no cooling will happen that
would be terrible
alright so we're just going to carefully
realign that with the holes where
everything came off of no we're not
ha ha ha very funny we need to put these
back on first haha that was a good one -
the whole point of this whole exercise
there we go all right how's that gonna
look no looks all right it's Plasti Dip
I guess ok so now it's time for attempt
number two lining everything up so
carefully this time with all the other
pieces in place
okay so just six screws to put it back
together most of which I haven't
misplaced just kidding I didn't misplace
any of them if I did that would be
Turban I don't do them up all the way at
this point you want to make sure you're
applying pressure evenly as you put the
cooler back on the card so we're just
doing them up a little bit then we're
going to tighten everything up at the
same time so now we're tightening a
cross pattern get everything nice and
tight on there there we go alright so
this for better or for worse is what our
graphics card looks like now
we have a nice green accent and I guess
Oh actually I didn't show you guys the
reassembly process for this there's a
safe place but here's the sabre-tooth
board nice and blacked out stealth doubt
and this is what the card will look like
in it
here we go except imagine two of them
okay well there I guess you don't have
to imagine it any more that's what it'll
look like
with both graphics cards installed with
their green accents not half bad now
it's time to put the RAM together so
we'll put this aside and get started on
that I've been doing this stuff long
enough to basically have a phobia of
losing one of a kind' screws that are
impossible to replace cuz man the number
of hours I've spent looking for that
kind of a stuff that kind of stuff okay
so each of these is going to go back
together with a pretty much identical
process I guess so this green bar is
going to slot back in here where it used
to be white assuming it still fits
come on okay there we go alright so
that's what those are going to look like
in there then the whole thing is going
to go back on top of the module and that
paint finish actually matches pretty
darn well ooh these are going to look
good oh I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked on
these all right so the back pieces come
through and then we screw the front
pieces in from the front pretty
straightforward
okay here we are putting in the last
screw and that is what our finished
modules look like that nice green light
bar and then that nice all-black
stealthy looking finish so let's go
ahead and install this in the last slot
on the board and that's it that my
friends is how you paint your computer
