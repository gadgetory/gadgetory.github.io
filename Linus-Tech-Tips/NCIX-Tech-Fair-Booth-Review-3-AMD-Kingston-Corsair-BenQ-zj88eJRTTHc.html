couple pretty cool show deals if you get
an x 3 processor for only 50 bucks which
is pretty crazy actually I need slick to
come over here and check this out oh
that's do that it looks like they moved
our light for some reason but we're
actually running this whole eyefinity
setup off of an NCIX pc that's running
an ati radeon 6950 graphics card so
let's move back around to the front
Amy's booth is actually pretty darn cool
because they have not only ultimate
eyefinity gaming system going on here
where you can play I think this is the
game that plays for you if you set it to
the easy enough difficulty level which
is handy because you know not everyone's
great at video games but they also have
a bit of a museum thing going on so
they'd bought an old eti Radeon graphics
card from before the acquisition and
then they're showing how far AMD has
taken that Radeon technology to the
point where now with a single card you
can convert 3 1080p monitors in directx
11 games nobody
we've also got a little Museum of a wide
variety of past the present and the
processors going back all the way to the
days when AMD and Intel actually shared
the same socket technology pretty cool
stuff welcome to the Kingston booth you
know I antec one of our guys from anzac
just showed up and was like yeah so my
systems are all over the place but I'm
not even attending the tech fair but you
can actually find its kind of ANZAC
exposes pretty much everywhere they've
got the antec kuhler 920 and tech high
current pro 850 power supply as well as
a PG rating case going on on the
Kingston video however we're going to
stay a little bit more focused on
Kingston so Kingston as you guys may or
may not know is world number one in
terms of memory products they are
enormous they make more memory than
anybody else everything from sodium's to
valueram to performance hyperx gaming
memory they pretty much do it now we've
also more recently gotten into SSDs they
have once again a wide variety of SSDs
from their sandforce ssdnow be plus
series which is more value oriented all
the way up to their premium San for
hyperx so these are using higher speed
NAND flash even those with the same
controller to achieve faster beads and
write speeds
is also enormous when it comes to USB
flash our static pamphlet is lemon seems
Kingston however it looks like they
haven't managed to actually put in a USB
thumb drive that their boot but I mean
you've probably seen a Kingston thumb
drive at some point in time and as a
special show deal you can get an eight
gig kingston datatraveler only 99 pencil
though those may be sold out at this
time because that was a pretty popular
one earlier on in the day so over here
the other kingston
FSG and
memory Howard system this is the new
hyperx 3k which is a more value oriented
edition of the HyperX it performs the
same but the endurance of the flash is a
little bit lower but it still comes with
a three-year warranty and it's still
according to continuous operation sort
of mean methods of calculating it should
last for years and years and years so
it's a pretty safe bet and there we've
got some hyperx ddr3 going on in there
as well welcome to the corsair booth
we've got a wide variety of stuff here
strangely they don't have any ram or USB
flash even though they're very well
known for those products not much in the
way of SSD course there's booth is
focused around their newer additions to
their lineup so that is cases
peripherals and cooling so right here
we've got the K 90 and the k-6 TVs or
mechanical gaming keyboards optimized
for MMO gaming as well as FPS gaming
respectively personally my favorite is
pretty k90 of those two because it has a
blue backlight on it as well as
programmable macro keys here they've
also got their h100 cooler and I can't
say enough good things about this
honestly in my opinion every freed on
liquid cooling unit should be dual fan
like this because that's where they
start to really distance themselves from
air cooling in terms of overclocking the
single fan ones are a little bit better
than air sometimes or their competitive
with their but these dual fan ones
especially once you start breaking up
the voltage really pull away next week
bought
these fries are MMOFPS oriented products
to go along with the keyboards
themselves so this one has a turn of
different buttons again optimized for
MMO slickers for some reason for moving
buttons from the keyboard and then next
we've got the m60 which has a sniper
button which reduces the sensitivity
when you're zoomed in so that you can
more easily go for the optical headshot
I have no idea how many people put this
on today so it might be like covered in
lice and stuff but hopefully not you
know Corsair applies a lice repellent
spray to the insides of all not just
getting it okay though but this is a USB
headset that features will be 7.1
virtual personally I'm not much of a
virtual surround guy and I would go into
vengeance 1300 the high in South guard
personally however it's great that they
have both options available whether you
want a USB headset or an analog headset
case they have the obsidian 550d this is
the first case course there's really
done that is optimized for silent
computing so it has noise dampening comb
here as well as on the inside of the
side panels and you can also see that
instead of having lots of ventilation
and mesh it uses closed panels in order
to block a lot of the noise so there's
still room for ventilation you can see
there's Vince holes here you can't
really see this one wait are they on
that side no they're not on that side
they're on this side there you go van
holes here slip this confused
that allow you to still get the cooling
you need however I wouldn't necessarily
put you know a 64 in duel gtx 690 s in
here this is more for your mid range
performance gaming system and you want
to keep nice and quiet you don't have to
keep it silent though you can take these
off take off the magnetic removable easy
clean fan filter here and you can
actually install more fans on the top
and more fans on the side if you want to
get the most cooling performance
possible out of your Corsair case
welcome to the men QB dissipative last
booth in this round of video tours they
have a couple of really cool products at
their booth they have the 2420 CX which
as you guys may or may not know is
pretty much my choice when it comes to
3d vision to lightness capable displays
so this one just have a Windows Update
pop up but they've got batman arkham
city running on here right now with 3d
vision one glasses remember light boost
is compatible as long as you have a
compatible monitor with either community
vision one or three division two glasses
now they also have their do computer and
the gp2 is awesome this is a pico
projector that is capable of using a
battery backup in fact there is a deal
at the show for 499 you get the gp2
projector with the battery backup which
is an amazing deal the gp2 is capable of
outputting up to 7
video and it fits oh if you have really
big pockets like you know cargo pants
from the 90's then you could totally put
a gp2 in your pocket it is LED backlit
which means you pretty much never have
to replace the lamp which makes it very
convenient i did a video about the gp2
as well has a huge huge array of input
options including an iphone dock that
you can use to play videos that are
stored on your iPhone or even over the
network as well as HDMI input and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
