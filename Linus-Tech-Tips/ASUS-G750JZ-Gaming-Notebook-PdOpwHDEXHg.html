centimeter fan to cool your gaming
notebook and it adds a four port USB hub
click now to learn more now with all the
recent hype about thin and light gaming
notebooks it might be easy for you of
the viewer to assume that more
traditional gaming notebooks aren't
relevant anymore but it's time for a bit
of a reality check
heat is a beach and the fundamental laws
of thermodynamics haven't changed lately
so if you want more processing power
you're also going to need to cram more
cooling capacity into it otherwise
thermal throttling or worse the eventual
degradation of your components can occur
not likely to be a concern here this is
a Seuss's latest and greatest from their
rog series the g 758 jz an aggressively
styled gaming notebook that aims to
deliver power without compromise in a
mobile form factor let's start with a
physical tour the top has the same
classic black soft touch finish that
we've seen in the last few generations
of G series models a plastic chroma
suits logo and a white illuminated
Republic of gamers logo beneath it I
liked this the first time I saw and I
still like it now rather than putting
colourful LEDs all over it that's a OMG
look at me I'm high-performance a soos
takes a more subtle approach and let's
aggressive lines and raw benchmarks do
the talking instead speaking of
aggressive let's move around to the back
where we find two independently
controlled cooling fans each with its
own copper heatsink and heat pipe system
connecting it to either the CPU or the
GPU in theory it provides great cooling
and practice it provides great cooling
and surprising acoustics as well it's
pretty much silent which means a lot
coming from me under light workloads and
stays reasonable even when you're gaming
me I'm gaming right now here's my
microphone look at that very very nice
moving around to the left side we find a
Kensington lock 2 USB 3 ports a DVD
writer and blu-ray reader combo drive
and a full sized SD card reader while
the front features indicator LEDs for
the usual suspects that can be viewed
with the lid open or with the lid closed
then on the right we find headphone and
microphone jacks 2 more USB 3 ports for
a total of 4 H
my hard-wired Gigabit LAN vga powerin
and ah yes the one I glossed over that
is not mini displayport although it'll
work with a DisplayPort monitor just
fine and even daisy chain no that is a
thunderbolt port this is one of the few
PC notebooks with Thunderbolt
making it a fantastic option for non
gaming folks like creative professionals
as well imagine as a photographer
packing something like this to a wedding
all the CPU power IO and CUDA
acceleration you need with nice fast
photo and video offloading as well nice
on the bottom we find a removable
battery and a dedicated subwoofer to go
with the effective Albia cryptically
placed front speakers that seem to fire
out of the rear vents as much as the
base of the screen here and then finally
there's an easy to access door that you
can open up to change around hard drive
or either of the 2 m2 SSDs that are
included I think it's great that it uses
a self-retaining screw by the way that's
basically impossible to lose so yay but
there's not much else of note down here
and now it is time to open this baby up
on the inside we find more classy
styling the bezel surrounding the G 750
jay-z's 17.3 inch screen it's a
reasonable size and has no adornments
other than a stylized webcam peephole
another plastic chrome Asus logo and
some protective rubber stoppers and
while the 1920 by 1080 resolution TN
panel may be a point of contention among
folks expecting an IPS panel with a
resolution greater than 1080p a seuss
isn't the first manufacturer to
sacrifice viewing angles and resolution
for the sake of not having to deal with
windows as terrible dpi scaling better
pixel response times and the ability to
actually run your games at native res on
a mobile GPU so I guess I see where
they're coming from even though it's not
a trade-off I would personally make if
give them a choice speaking of
trade-offs if only I could have the
beautiful looks of brushed aluminum on
my wrist rest without feeling like I
have to clean it every 26 seconds but
there is good news to the chiclet style
keyboard embedded in this brushed
aluminum finish here is a very solid
implementation with
longer than usual travel distances for
the keys a vibrant white backlight so
you can see what you're doing in the
dark and a pretty darn standard layout
that other than lengthening the right
control doesn't try to do anything crazy
just the way I like it
the nice big touchpad is also
thoughtfully made with a great texture
on its plastic surface
a stylish chrome beveled edge and a very
satisfying
you're not mechanical click to the
dedicated non click pad buttons again
something that I prefer so what the
physical two are out of the way let's
talk about the specs of the G 750 JZ I
mean now all that babbling about
processing power and cooling during my
intro I better be ready to back it up
with some beefy numbers right yeah don't
worry we got beefy numbers first up is
Intel's Core i7 4708 q a quad-core 8
thread monster that runs at 2.4
gigahertz Basin up to 3.4 gigahertz with
turbo boost it's matched with 24 gigs of
ddr3 1600 ramped so whether you're using
this machine for gaming hardcore chrome
tab abuse or even video editing you will
have CPU power and RAM to spare and next
up is the other big star of the show an
overclocked nvidia gtx 880 m this
graphics card has a fully enabled gk 104
GPU in it that actually runs at darn
near the same specs as in videos desktop
enthusiast grade gtx 770 one key
difference though is that our mobile
graphics card trades some memory speed
for a larger 4 gig frame buffer this
will be a boom when running higher
quality textures but it will reduce
performance somewhat in other situations
but of course when I talk about
performance reductions I mean compared
to graphics cards that are about as
thick as this entire notebook can go on
a desktop PC so the rest of the unit
ain't too shabby either and as I was
going through making a little list for
myself so I didn't miss anything you
know you got your dual 128 gig SSDs that
can be configured in raid 4 boot
although strangely they came unrated out
of the box for me a one terabyte
mechanical storage drive onboard killer
and wireless I started thinking to
myself how does this compare to buying a
desktop in the old days a gaming
notebook was heavy loud sucked battery
like there was no tomorrow
and finally didn't even perform very
well
well now that's changed a fair bit and
aside from the 4770k being a fair bit
faster than the 4700 HQ that's in this
notebook the rest of this stuff is
actually pretty close to the hardware
you'd use in a typical custom desktop I
mean not exactly mind you I'd make some
different choices for sure but I still
thought this would be an interesting
exercise so here's what I came up with I
decided to put together a desktop
configuration that in spite of some
approximation so for example I went with
an 18 inch LCD and the cheapest
reasonable quality ups I could find as
an equivalent for the notebook 17.3 inch
screen and built-in battery and then I
took all that stuff and like threw in a
50 dollar charge like what NCIX chargers
for PC assembly and with the overall
goal not of achieving perfect
equivalency in every detail but rather
of building a desktop that was of
similar spec features and quality
compared to my notebook I wanted to see
what the difference in price came out to
be and what the difference in
performance came out to be surprisingly
for performance parity with similar
grade components it was only about a two
hundred dollar difference or about ten
percent and here are a couple of little
performance benchmarks so when you look
at how closely it performs I mean yeah
it's not as good let's be realistic here
a gaming laptop it is not gonna be as
good as a desktop from a price to
performance ratio but compared to the
way it used to be if you're willing to
sacrifice that upgrade ability for
portability it's not nearly as bad as it
used to be which I guess leads us
naturally into our conclusion who is
this product for does the G 750 jz feel
a useful niche as an in-between option
amongst the sexy slim gaming notebook
and big non portable gaming desktop
options out there I'd say yes yes it
does at four point eight kilograms it's
not light enough that I'm gonna go back
packing up a mountain with it but it
sure beats the heck out of trying to log
desktops around if you're like us and
frequently filming on location and if
you combine that with the fact that it's
much less expensive quieter and runs
cooler than high powered slim gaming
notebooks out there and is much more
portable than that value gaming desktop
whose performance
came surprisingly close to I think we've
got ourselves a serious contender for
your money if you want a portable
workstation slash gaming rig that you
don't need to carry around with you all
the time anyway guys thanks for watching
