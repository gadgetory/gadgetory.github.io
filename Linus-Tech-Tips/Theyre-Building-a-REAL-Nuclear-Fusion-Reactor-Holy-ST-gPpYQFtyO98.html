general fusion where they are attempting
to build the world's first commercially
viable nuclear fusion power plant and it
might not look like much but the only
way that the technology inside could be
any more space-age would be if I was
actually shooting on the moon today so
why don't we go take a look after I tell
you about tunnel bear tunnel bear makes
really simple easy to use VPN
applications so you can enjoy a more
open Internet check them out at tunnel
bear comm /l tt
so what exactly is nuclear fusion well
on an atomic level basically you take a
couple of hydrogen atoms get them up to
a really high temperature and then you
like smash them together once they're
fused you'll be left with a helium atom
I'm Stephen today so cuz one proton plus
1 proton equals 2 protons and you'll get
some energy or rather you'll get a lot
of energy like like 10 times what you'd
get from a nuclear fission reaction like
the ones that power traditional nuclear
plant so that all sounds super cool
already and we haven't even gotten to
the best part yet nuclear fusion works
around the clock unlike solar or wind
and it's a hundred percent clean and
safe the reaction is actually incapable
of causing a meltdown or other
radioactive incident and as much as this
might look like some kind of I you know
death ray
the only direct byproducts our helium
like for party balloons and energy so no
depleted uranium seeping into the
environment for thousands of years no
greenhouse gas emissions and get this
the fuel for it is practically free you
input deuterium a hydrogen isotope that
you can extract from ordinary seawater
with a centrifuge oh that's awful
well and lithium and some critics might
point out that these materials
particularly lithium are not technically
renewable but at least for heavy water
the reaction uses so little of it and
there's enough sitting around that by
the time you run out the Sun will have
enveloped the earth anyway so yeah I
think we are probably good there well ok
then Linus if it's a great why is fusion
power taking so long
ah I'm glad you asked while the
fundamental principles have been
reasonably well understood for decades
Engineering and science required to
build something practical in the real
world are well in scientific terms a
total to get right in order for nuclear
fusion to occur between two hydrogen
atoms they need to be heated up to a
hundred and fifty million degrees
Celsius that's about ten times hotter
than the center of the Sun and you've
got to do that efficiently no one's
gonna buy a fusion power plant that
consumes more power than it outputs duh
so then how would you get something bad
hot well you could use a device called a
tokamak to make a plasma doughnut and
then manipulate it with liquid helium
cooled magnets sounds promising you
could take a see here peppercorn sized
piece of frozen deuterium and then
bombard it from all sides at exactly the
same time with what is quite literally
the world's most powerful laser
effectively blowing up the outside
compressing the inside enough to start
the reaction and both of those methods
have actually succeeded at using nuclear
fusion to get close to producing more
power than they consumed but the problem
is that via both of those methods it is
extremely difficult to actually harness
the power to generate electricity
ah I'm gonna do that again
general fusions approach is kind of like
a hybrid of the other two and it
operates kind of like a super high-tech
diesel engine so first they use one of
these guys to create a five million
degree ball of plasma then they rapidly
compress it with steam-powered Pistons
the pressure from which heats it to a
hundred and fifty million degrees at
that point the deuterium kind of ignites
releasing energy and if all this sounds
difficult don't worry in real life it is
way harder
this is general fusions last generation
large-scale plasma injector where they
prototype their process of creating a
plasma of sufficient quality that it can
survive for long enough for the Pistons
in the compression chamber to fully
compress it so during a cycle these
valves right up here will inject just 2
milligrams of deuterium evenly into the
chamber which goes all the way around in
a ring then 1 million amps at 15,000
volts so this is about the same as your
average lightning bolt goes across the
electrical feed right here and strips
the electrons off the deuterium creating
a ball of plasma these particles then
spin around the ball of plasma wrapping
it in its own magnetic field creating an
insulating layer around the plasma to
give it a longer lifespan from there
these big electromagnets here will push
the ball of plasma out the front of the
injector into the compression chamber
which would be under this part right
over here now the rest of this guy which
is actually about the front 2/3 is just
for data collection every test that they
run generates about a gigabyte of data
and even after a hundred and fifty
thousand experiments there is still work
to do I guess that's why general fusion
is so open about showing off their work
because even if you stole all the
drawings and built yourself one of these
machines there are literally hundreds of
thousands of variables to tune for
plasma quality so you'd basically have
built yourself a multi-million dollar
paperweight on the subject of millions
of dollars much of the research is
actually done on smaller less expensive
little injector prototypes like Spectre
here these guys only take a couple of
months to create instead
of years and they give the team valuable
insight in between larger projects mind
you even this kind of thing does not
come easy
every aspect of this research is complex
and expensive like okay here how do you
know if your plasma is at five million
degrees you can't just stick a cave
probe in it ah so it turns out you have
to shine a super-strong laser through
the plasma and then measure the small
bit of light that is deflected by the
plasma and this is only about one in
every quadrillion photons that you've
pumped in that get turned into some kind
of useful signal so interpreting that
data is quite literally the full-time
job of Bill here who has a PhD from the
University of Maryland and that is just
one example but they are making progress
inside this cage is the largest and most
powerful plasma injector in the world
it's the latest generation of the one
that we looked at earlier and they're
running tests on it every day in hopes
of using a similar model to create a
fusion demonstration plant in as little
as four to five years so unlike the
other one this guy is actually hooked up
do you see all these containers around
me
these are capacitor banks so when all of
them are operating they'll be capable of
20 gigawatts of power that's enough to
send 16.5 DeLoreans back in time
simultaneously the problem though is
that when you're unleashing a lightning
bolt worth of power you throw out a ton
of electronic interference it's such a
big problem that all of the sensor data
has to be transmitted through fiber
optic cables to a nearby Faraday cage
full of general fusions own custom-made
digitizer boards they ended up designing
their own because create
an electronics engineering department
was cheaper than buying gear like this
off the shelf now general fusion weren't
the first ones to come up with the idea
of smashing plasma but the US Naval
Research Lab zhe's incredibly named
Project Linus ended up getting abandoned
back in the 1970s because there were a
couple of problems they just couldn't
overcome behind me is a couple of
solutions this is general fusions
piston-driven compression chamber proof
of concept now the real one would have
many more Pistons but the operating
principle would be similar every piston
would push down simultaneously with the
tolerance of about 10 microseconds
injecting liquid metal stored in the
Pistons and in the 1000 rpm spinning
grid on the inside and that metal would
squeeze the plasma bubble that would be
injected from the top now the timing for
all of this has to be so precise because
much like squeezing a water balloon in
your hands if you don't compress it
evenly then it'll kind of splurt out or
break apart and that would cause a
misfire
assuming everything goes right though
and the simulations say it should the
fuel ignites fusion occurs and that
liquid metal gets heated to about 600
degrees Celsius after which it gets
circulated through insulated pipes by a
magneto hydrodynamics to a traditional
steam turbine power generator just like
what you would find at a coal or a
natural gas power plant today which
should make general fusions solution
sort of a drop-in upgrade for an
existing facility now fun fact it is not
a perpetual motion machine because it
does require a constant supply of fuel
but some of the steam that gets
generated is actually going to be used
to actuate the Pistons
keeping the cycle going general fusion
hopes that once they reach production
they'll be able to run one of these
reactions
every second generating about a hundred
to 200 megawatts of power about the
sweet spot for replacing existing coal
power plants in developed countries and
not so much that it would blow up the
power distribution systems in developing
countries the market where the most new
power generation will have to happen in
the coming years now none of this is a
sure thing
I mean nothing in life is but if general
fusion and its investors which includes
Jeff Bezos apparently by the way can
stay on course then the future looks
really bright not just for their company
