discovered the keyword gaming it feels
like we've been on a bit of a slippery
slope here you see at first gaming was
used primarily to describe products
endorsed by professional gamers or that
had features that were somehow directly
related to their gaming utility like
headsets with noise cancelling
microphones for example but then came
gaming power supply's gaming chairs and
gaming computer memory
none of which perform measurably better
than their similarly priced non-gaming
counterparts so where does this path
ultimately lead us to here today in this
moment to the epitome of bullsh gaming
marketing the gaming microSD card from
HyperX today's video is brought to you
by Thermaltake thermal takes gaming
level 20 cases feature radiator mounting
for water cooling gaming focused
aesthetics and beautiful tempered glass
panels check them out at the link below
let's begin with an entirely on ironic
read of the press release the HyperX
gaming microsd card is an ideal storage
solution for gamers who love
downloadable context what are they
finding these people and downloadable
games but don't want to buy multiple
cards or deal with long load times this
card features read speeds of 100
megabytes per second and write speeds of
80 megabytes per second and capacities
up to 256 gaming bytes so you'll get
fast access to your games and you can
download to your heart's content hyper
exes senior manager for console business
said that our goal was to bring reliable
high capacity and plug-and-play storage
to mobile gamers and HyperX is excited
to make that happen already so as usual
there's not a word about exactly what
makes these cards gaming and the only
performance claims are asterisk as per
the tradition so let's start then by
exploring just how they came to those
numbers we hooked up the 256 gig version
to a USB 3 port on our Z 370 test bench
Va Kingston card reader and ran crystal
disk mark which is what the HyperX rep
told us that they used for their
performance claims now our results fell
well short of the 100 read 80 write
claims coming in at 80 8.7 Meg's on
sequential reads and sixty six point
three on writes and then when we sanity
check to these results with a sequential
file transfer we ended up with very
similar results
now the disclaimer does say the speed
may vary due to host hardware software
and usage so digging for the truth we
tested the card again in all four major
platforms as you can see when paired
with an X $2.99 motherboard we actually
came extremely close to the stated
claims with X 470 coming in at a close
second alright fair enough then hyper X
now we move on to our real-world testing
mobile game loading time excuse me
mobile game loading times starting with
Android so we used a razor gaming phone
and pub G mobile version 0.8 point Oh
to determine how long it took from
tapping the icon to reaching the login
screen and believe it or not the gaming
card actually managed to match our
onboard storage on the phone which I
guess kind of makes sense given that
it's got the fancy new a1 speed rating
which is a newfangled way of saying that
it'll handle the random i/o necessary to
run apps better than traditional SD
cards which are rated only for
sequential read and write speeds which I
guess brings us perfectly to our next
challenger our non-gaming high-capacity
512 gig card from integral this puppy is
rated at 80 megabytes per second read
speeds so not that different but it's
bad out eh
this card is slow morning when we first
formatted it and on its first run it got
absolutely stomped by hyper X's gaming
card gaming sorry so at this point
thanks for actually looking pretty darn
good for the world's first gaming micro
SD card ah that was until we followed up
the test with a couple more rounds of
game launches and the issues with our
integral card disappeared never to be
seen again
so after that first launch anomaly our
gaming cart is faster but only by about
8% or three seconds to put that in real
world terms
okay well hyper X is marketing barely
even mentions phones anyway so let's
move on to our next test device the
Nintendo switch running The Legend of
Zelda breath of the wild and in a
massive surprise to no one just like
with our smartphone testing the results
came in only marginally different with
the switches onboard storage being the
fastest no solution achieving a drastic
experience altering performance Delta
over any of the others so um what's left
to say then this is a perfectly good
micro SD card with a lifetime warranty
from a reputable company that will
probably still exist in the time that
you'd actually want any warranty service
on this so we are not saying not to buy
this
we're just saying that there's nothing
about it that seems to be any more
gaming than the socks and sandals that
I'm wearing right now and that the main
takeaway today is that regardless of
what SD card you choose the experience
is unlikely to be dramatically different
that is unless you're the kind of person
who gets off on sitting next to people
with cheaper SD cards on the bus and
opening up the same programs as then
then gloating about your loading times
for three glorious seconds before they
are sitting in exactly the same staging
area waiting to get on exactly the same
parachute bus speaking of gaming is
featuring some gaming peripherals
they've teamed up with creative and are
now selling their mouse and keyboard at
50% off the retail price
so we've got the Vanguard k-8 keyboard
which uses on Ron mechanical switches
it's got a hundred and nine customizable
RGB keys those are gaming and it
includes dedicated macro keys it's got
one of those nice roller real volume
controls and media keys and a removable
wrist rest then we've got the C demo for
Mouse it has seven fully programmable
buttons it's got a PWM 3360 IR LED
gaming grain sensor which actually that
that does matter having a good Mouse for
gaming is important and it runs anywhere
from two hundred to twelve thousand dpi
so check out the links below to grab
yourself a new mouse and a new keyboard
for gaming so thanks guys for watching
