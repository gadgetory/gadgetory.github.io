guide on how to install the nvidia
geforce drivers so what I've decided to
do in addition to that is a little guide
on how to configure your system for 3d
vision surround so first of all you will
need three monitors all 120 Hertz you
will need two GeForce GTX no not
necessarily GTX you'll need two is
supported GeForce graphics cards in this
case I've got a couple of GTX 480 s you
will also need nvidia active shutter
glasses as well as an IR emitter so
you'll need to have the latest beta
drivers installed and by the time you
watch this I guess there might be an
official driver for this a wickel one so
you go to the Nvidia control panel you
wait for it to load once it's done
loading you go ahead and go into the
configure SLI physics and surround so
I'm going to go ahead and stand displays
with surround so I'm going to apply that
first and then I'll configure it after
so the surround option is the new one in
this particular menu we've always had
SLI we've always had activate all
displays and disable SLI so it says
connect displays to graphics cards as
shown I have already done this so I'm
going to go ahead and click apply again
this might take a moment yes I am sure
and then we hope that it all works all
displays are blank no signal wait for it
hey there we go okay so now the Nvidia
control panel is up on the middle screen
my Start menu is also on the middle
screen but my Start menu spans to the
right-hand screen as well as the
left-hand screen so you can see that we
do have to rearrange the displays so the
easiest way to do that is with the
little wizard that's up here right now
so you just click identify so we've got
three one two so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make it so that three is
over here just can drag it over three
one two so that should match the
identify
function and then once I've done that I
just click apply it'll rearrange my
monitors and it's that simple okay so
there's one more thing that we need to
configure for the surround option so we
can either configure it to adjust for
the display bezels what that means is
it's adding a little bit of resolution
here I'm going to sort of try to explain
this it's adding some resolution behind
the bezels so that means that if you
have say for example like nvidia 'he's
got displayed here a road you can either
make it so that the bezels will hide
some of the picture or you can make it
so that the bezel will simply just be in
between and the picture will will have
that gap in between it so oh okay looks
like i've configured it one way or the
other i missed which one i configured
personally i prefer this way I don't
mind having that gap but it doesn't
really matter oh no I see what I've done
okay now I did click the wrong one okay
so yeah you can either configure it to
have them lineup or configure to have
them not lineup you know what why don't
we go through really quickly here and I
just want to show you okay configure I
just want to show you how to do the
bezel correction even though I don't
prefer it that way
okay yeah okay yeah yes we want to
adjust them okay so in video gives us
this little road thing and I'm going to
go ahead and change the width right here
I'm going to change the width of my
extra resolution that I'm adding until
the road approx lines up so I'm holding
it down that looks pretty close to me so
that's 150 pixels so I'm going to go
ahead and click create resolutions and
once that's done that will be applied
across all monitors so what that means
is that my configuration which is now
set up let's do 3d really quick and then
I'll show you exactly what that means as
far as resolutions are concerned
actually show you that right now
so we'll go to screen resolution so we
are running at 57 60 by 1080 rather than
the full resolution which
fifty nine ten by ten eighty fifty nine
ten by ten eighty hold on a minute
nineteen twenty not doesn't make any
sense now fifty nine ten by ten eighty
is probably the the offset one oh now
I've gotten confused myself adding extra
pixels for the width of the bezels yeah
yeah definitely
okay so yeah we've added a little bit of
extra of extra width for the bezels to
our resolution here so you can see that
if I drag a window over here it's
actually going to block out words so
here see if I drag this to the side set
up stereoscopic the entire word
stereoscopic can be blocked out by the
bezel because of the way that I've
altered the resolution it's not really
ideal for desktop use but it does
provide a little bit of a better
experience for games so you don't have
kind of like the wing of your plane like
starting here and then like coming up
over here or something weird like that
