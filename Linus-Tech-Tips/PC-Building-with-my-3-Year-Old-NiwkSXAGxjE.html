great performance and very low noise
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so I want you
to help me pick out your favorite Linus
tech tips shirt to wear do you like this

we might have to do is maybe some
clothes pins okay this is signature and
there's your mail I have mail too Oh

microphone I've never put one on someone
else you got to do a microphone test
make sure it's working can you yell ah
ah I'll have to clip it to like the back
of his neck or something all right so do
you want to go pick out the parts for
the computer let's go okay hold on tight
first thing we need to pick is a case
when you point it the one you want you

something that we haven't covered before

okay so now we need to pick a power
supply pair supply do you want this one

gonna work I guess I gotcha
do you want this one or yes all right so
now I'm gonna pick the CPU because we
can't have one that's not compatible 59
60 X I will let you pick out the memory
though hmm okay you got one choice for
memory do you like these ones okay well

using the Ragin tech triton so now this
is really important you got to pick your
graphics card which of these ones do you

table oh good job how do you think red
screwdriver okay yeah you're like a
little early version of Linus aren't you
hey alright that's enough that's enough

what do you want to start with good
choice well we start by assembling the
components on the motherboard outside of
the case think luke forgot to put the
i/o shield for our ws board back in the

the water cooler wow you picked out a
pretty cool looking water cooler there
hey this is fun with this one we get to

water what color do you like then that's
a great choice that's gonna go perfectly
with our red graphics card you want the
big one or the small one big small you
want the small one yeah that I can carry
that is a good choice so you can choose
red white or green red
good choice red just making water gets
red that's right so what part do you
