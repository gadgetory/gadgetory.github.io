your unboxing of the razor phone - why
haven't you reviewed the razor phone yet
well because I didn't get one but that
changes today razor just sent over a
care package this is it the 64 gig and
only version of their new flagship
first-ever mobile device the razor phone
oh that's how the box opens okay so
there's a big long letter about how much
you love razor ok that's good then
razors characteristically excellent
packaging you've got a razor sim removal
tool wow that's actually a really cool
sim removal tool alright cool
yeah they've got my attention so far
we've got well it's there so there's a
Type C - three-and-a-half millimeter
adapter a type C - type C charging cable
a wall wart and the razor phone itself
so I watched the keynote I have a pretty
good idea of what to expect from this
device but what I actually didn't do is
watch anybody else's unboxings or
reviews of it because I really wanted to
save my impressions for myself and first
impressions this is a really really big
phone like I might not have grabbed the
right devices for kind of hands on size
comparison here I've got an iPhone 10
and you can see it absolutely dwarfs
that this is definitely a phablet sized
device I've got a Galaxy s8 it all right
there it is next to a pixel 2xl so those
are much more similar in terms of their
size it's not
actually a lot bigger in terms of its
total width or its total height compared
to the pixel 2xl but there is something
about blockier phones that makes them
feel bigger in the hand with that said
something that I think Razer has found a
good balance of here is that it's still
because of it because it's got nice flat
edges you can still kind of support it
like this and using it one-handed is not
going to be the end of the world in a
pinch especially if you're someone who
has larger hands than I do
okay this is just not working so let's
try 2.4 gigahertz
maybe I'm just entering the password
wrong twice in a row it's gonna pop the
sim out of my 5 T since I'm actually
done writing up my review on that one
and I'm ready to start using the razor
phone as a daily driver and we'll see if
maybe throwing a sim in it it's gonna
give us enough of a data connection to
get through the setup process here yeah
sure well I guess I'll just do this 250
mega update on my mobile data hopefully
it fixes the Wi-Fi issues maybe that's
what it's for you know what it's okay
everybody needs an update now and then
we have successfully updated razor phone
let's start over
Hey look at that alright we have a Wi-Fi
connection no problem Cal be right back
once I've signed in wow the display has
kind of a blotchiness to it I'm not sure
if you're gonna be able to pick that up
on camera but you can really see on
white white backgrounds that it's not
quite a pure white can you see that has
kind of like a grid kind of pattern to
it interesting you know so far it
actually reminds me a lot of like one of
Sony's older experience it's got the
fingerprint sensor on the right it's got
the kind of squarish blocky shape unlike
Sony though it's using a basically stock
Android with just a couple of
modifications oh it looks like that 120
Hertz display is enabled right out of
the box
I feel smooth I'm still seeing that
slight pattern but honestly it's the
kind of thing you could probably get
used to in exchange for that sort of
buttery feeling to the interface I'm
liking that oh I could get used to that
okay so first thing I want to do here is
get the developer options enabled so
that I can turn on yeah there we go okay
interesting so we've got a live
framerate counter that's telling us
exactly what refresh rate the displays
running at here so you can see that when
the image is static it's actually
turning way down to as low as 20 frames
per second then when you move around
actually you could see it hits there
while it kicked in it's jumping up to 90
frames per second really cool okay I'm
gonna just fire up the Google Play Store
and get a game that I know supports 120
Hertz we interrupt this video to bring
you the real reason that I couldn't
connect to the Wi-Fi Alex here walked in
complaining that he couldn't get a
device on the Wi-Fi and I realized what
we're out of IP addresses that's
probably also why all the smart light
control modules aren't connecting yeah
so I'm calling tech support on my razor
phone sounds okay I guess
mailboxes fall I have to try again later
worst IT guy of all time look at all
this crap look at all these devices why
are there so many devices what is bad
address
nobody names anything you know what
let's just kick it off
we found the button so I'm just gonna
open it right up to all the way down to
let's say 30 and hopefully we don't step
on anything okay try and connect
we'll give it a second okay yes and back
to you Linus okay so we are back to our
unboxing of the razor phone let's go
ahead and fire up Simpsons tapped-out a
game that supposedly supports 120 FPS on
this 120 Hertz display and of course
there's an update it's not as many as
this phones getting okay age to continue
I don't like it but I'm 31
oh go away tap to play anonymously to
start playing well the game some things
in the background you know what that
pattern that I noticed before really
only noticeable on plain white
Wow those speakers get really loud I
gotta say I was impressed by the
speakers on the pixel 2 and the pixel 2
XL but these absolutely blow them away
okay I'm not sure that this is the kind
of game that benefits like the most from
high frame rate but that's cool I mean
the zooming when it's not hiccuping here
is really smooth okay next order of
business we could try another game the
ones that are included world of 10 they
don't have a lot of color in that game
titanfall ass Hey okay between now and
the full review I'm gonna have to spend
some time in that one like I'm I'm
picturing giant robots like like
twerking you know late
no no Brendon no oh wow all the all the
no over there okay that's fine I'll
spend more time on the gaming aspects of
the phone before the full reviews the
last thing I just want to have a quick
look at is the camera now this is
something that Razer has already even
acknowledged that they're gonna have to
improve a little bit you know other than
like ah quick test shot of something I'm
not going to be able to do much with it
now but I mean other than some you know
aliasing around his head or whatever I'm
not seeing anything that immediately
makes it stand out as being like
terrible here's a pixel to excel so yeah
there's clearly some finer detail in
this guy already but you know really
it's gonna come down to how usable it is
in the day-to-day so there you have it
unboxing of the razor phone full review
to come if you guys dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed me but
consider checking out where to buy those
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there you
know what I'm not gonna do the full
outro forget is just unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
