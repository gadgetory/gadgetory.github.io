machine for twitch streamers using on
raid and virtualization to capitalize on
the hike or count of Intel's Core i9
processors and the results got us
wondering well just what other practical
applications could such a set up have
also you guys were wondering just how we
got the whole thing working so thanks to
Intel sponsoring this follow-up project
we are about to boldly go where very few
men have gone before and create a triple
headed vr gaming set up with the whole
thing running off of one tower and
actually one CPU
as you probably know vr gaming is a
demanding workload for both your CPU and
your GPU so when we set out to put
together a system that could not only
run triple AVR titles like Star Trek
bridge crew but actually handle three
instances concurrently we knew we were
gonna need the best of the best so we'll
start with the CPU if we were running a
single instance of bridge crew a modern
processor like an intel core i7 8700 k
would be a great choice but since we're
running free and we need a couple of
course left over for our hypervisor we
chose the Intel Core I 979 60 X so you
can actually see with all three of our
gaming rigs running at about 70 to 90
percent utilization this CPU is still
capable of running at nearly 4 gigahertz
which means no dropped frames in our
game due to CPU bottlenecks afraid to
touch this thing too hard it's a little
fragile anyway 4 ran we went with 64
gigs of 32 hundred megahertz g.skill
Trident ddr4 in a quad channel
configuration and that last bit is
important because it allows us to give
16 gigs of memory to each of our gaming
rigs with some left over and while very
few desktop workloads benefit from quad
channel memory when three demanding
workloads are hitting it at once well
it's a lot more important than usual to
have all the bandwidth you can get now
for our graphics cards we actually ended
up with a mixture of different Nvidia V
are capable cards ranging from the gtx
1070 all the way up to the titan XP now
the point we were trying to make here
using different cards is that as long as
we have enough CPU and memory resources
and they're above a certain threshold it
actually doesn't matter what mixture of
video cards we use now the motherboard
on the other hand was a really important
piece of the puzzle you can't always
count on virtualization features to be
implemented correctly
in the UEFI BIOS so we turned to the
same asus prime x2 99 deluxe from our
gaming and streaming combo machine now
let's look at some special pieces that
we needed for this config one of the
limitations of KVM the underlying
virtualization tech the done raid uses
is that if you pass a USB device through
to a virtual machine like say for
example a mouse it won't be hot
pluggable by default and if you have
more than one of the same peripheral
like all of our vibes they would all
have to be passed through to the same VM
which obviously wouldn't have worked
very well for our demo of three people
running their own discrete copies of the
game in multiplayer mode fortunately
this guy right here this thing exists
it's a single USB PCIe expansion card
that has four discrete controller chips
on it so that means each of them can be
passed through to a separate VM without
any performance bottlenecking then this
is cool
when you pass the whole controller
through to a VM you also get hot-plug
support so we just used a few cheap hubs
and now each of our VMs can have
multiple USB devices all of which are
hot pluggable next up is another sort of
KVM but this one has nothing to do with
virtualization this right here is the
level one tax for port KVM switch it is
super expensive at over 300 US dollars
but it's DisplayPort 1.2 meaning that it
is 4k 60 Hertz compatible and apparently
it even works with free sync and gsync
if both your connected monitor and
graphics part support them now it wasn't
strictly speaking necessary but it
allowed us to use a single monitor
keyboard and mouse to quickly switch
between all of our virtual machines for
configuration using this console right
here finally we've got our handy dandy
blinders here
see if one vive headset can see both its
own lighthouses and another one you are
gonna have a bad time and then we had
some weird timeout issues with our rifts
even on a certified USB controller so we
just put up these cloths now we can walk
you guys through the steps required to
set up a configuration like this first
we need to land in the unread webui
where we'll assign an SSD cache to run
our VMs off of and hey did I mention
before we've got four cores and 16 gigs
of ram left 4 unread well we can use 60
terabytes worth of Seagate's
12 terabyte iron wolf pros and throw
those in an on Radar a where they can
safely store personal data off the
public cloud or even serve up transcoded
media files via plex then what we're
gonna do is jump into the VMS tab where
we need to configure our basic VMs set
up pass-through for our graphics cards
this is kind of the special unrated
sauce that allows high performance
gaming in VMs and setup pass-through for
our USB controllers from there we need
some KVM specific drivers for Windows
and then it is mostly business as usual
keep in mind though that without three
discreet sound cards you'll be relying
on the HDMI audio built into your
graphics card or in our case the USB
audio device built into your VR headset
oh and here's a special headache we got
to experience you see we had to fit
three dual slot video cards and the USB
card into a six slot motherboard now
normally on raid needs an additional
video card for itself bringing the total
card count to more than the board
physically has so we solved that issue
by grabbing the primary cards BIOS
modifying it and then presenting that
BIOS to unweight as if it was an actual
card yay virtual graphics card for a
mainstream board with onboard graphics
this step would probably be unnecessary
but with a CPU that fits
to a mainstream board this kind of
performance wouldn't be possible so this
was the most elegant workaround that we
could find and quite honestly it's
pretty darn elegant every one of our VMs
is capable of delivering a smooth steady
vr gaming experience concurrently and
this is all thanks to the recent drop in
price
not to mention increase in clock speeds
of high core count desktop CPUs and
virtualization technology so a huge
thanks to Intel for sponsoring this demo
and the folks are done RAID for helping
us out whenever we got stuck
John you rock and Tom and Eric you guys
are cool too so thanks for watching guys
