to learn more welcome to what will be a
pretty quick and straightforward
unboxing of the Linksys e500 this is
what they're calling a smart Wi-Fi
router and it runs at AC 1750 so it's
dual band which means 2.4 gigahertz and
5 gigahertz and remember when they spec
these maximum throughputs they're
actually stacking the total combined
throughput on the multiple bands and
across multiple technology so it's
actually AC 1300 or 1.3 gigabit and n
450 now they're also calling it a smart
Wi-Fi router which basically means it's
got a bunch of different features
including my smart Wi-Fi the ability to
utilize apps to customize your Wi-Fi
home get anywhere access to your network
enable intelligent media prioritization
so some of these features are great some
of them are not necessarily as great the
EA 4500 with what they called at that
time
Cisco Cloud Connect was I didn't end up
using those features and I instead used
the more bare-bones firmware but what I
liked about the EA 4500 is it was
extremely fast extremely powerful and
didn't rely any fancy configurations in
order to really get awesome performance
out of it compared to some of the other
routers that we tried so we actually
have quite a few of those deployed so
why are we upgrading to the EA 6500 you
might ask and the answer is pretty
straightforward so number one is that it
uses wireless AC so if you have any
devices that are able to leverage AC for
example I have an HTC One you will
potentially see some speed benefit there
number two is the fact that it's
simultaneous dual been so 2.4 and 5
gigahertz means that you have the
potential for maximum range as well as
maximum throughput and we have some
content coming very soon on Nvidia
shield which relies on a very strong
wireless signal in order to stream HD
video which is essentially your game so
in order to stream HD games from your
computer to your handheld device so we
wanted something that was really beefy
enough so we asked to Linksys to go
ahead and send one of these
to us in terms of accessories you get a
huge power brick I mean this thing's
this thing I mean I guess this is in
line with what I already knew about a/c
and if you look at any of the actually
decent a/c add-in cards such as the one
from a soos which has a massive heatsink
on it and like antennas that come out
like this this is not power sipping
hardware and so we're not and then the
kind of implementation in here is not
the same as what you might find in a
phone so don't expect to see 1.3 gigabit
throughput to your phone but it is a
significant improvement over wireless n
we also get an Ethernet cable as well as
a set up CD and last but not least we
get the router itself which has that
same kind of not like the older UFO
shape where they were super glossy but
it has the same kind of shape as the ei
4500 except that it is significantly
larger and has more ventilation which is
also in line with that larger power
adapter so we find ventilation holes
here along the bottom where we expect
there to be passively drawn in there's
four rubber feet here here here and here
as well and this was missing from the EA
4500 glad to see they added this wall
mounts right here so you can go ahead
and put a couple nails on the wall and
hang it off that then all along the
sides of the device side front and other
side there goes the Box we find more
ventilation holes and then again in the
top here here and here on the back we
find what links this is calling and this
should really be a cardinal sin
rebranding WPS I think they're calling
it simple tap technology TM for easy
setup that is a WPS button right there
so it allows you to without entering any
security keys connect this to other
devices you've also got an integrated
five ports which four of which are
normal ports and one of which is
intended as a LAN port so that's where
you'll plug your broadband modem into
and then you've got a couple of USB
ports for storage so if you don't have
something like a dedicated nas you can
add storage to this simply by plugging
things in there there's often support
for things like printers as well a
hardware reset button as well as power
input so the last things that I should
probably mention about this are the high
powered amplifier for ultimate range
remember guys 5 gigahertz routers
do not necessarily have the same kind of
range as 2.4 gigahertz routers it is
inherently a shorter range technology
but what's good about it is there's less
potential for interference whether it's
from your cordless phone or whether it's
from other wireless networks around you
from people who haven't upgraded to 5
gigahertz or microwaves or whatever else
so you might get more effective range
out of it and then they also have lots
of parental controls and I personally
find their firmware easy to use but not
just easy to use but quicker to use
because you don't have to reboot your
router in order to apply any changes
which is something that maybe people
using aftermarket firmware take for
granted but for people who don't want to
go down that route when I compare this
to something like D Link's latest and
greatest AC router which requires a 300
second cooldown when you upgrade the
firmware and I think a 100 or 90 second
cooldown when you apply any changes this
is much faster when you're trying to
diagnose when any kind of random network
