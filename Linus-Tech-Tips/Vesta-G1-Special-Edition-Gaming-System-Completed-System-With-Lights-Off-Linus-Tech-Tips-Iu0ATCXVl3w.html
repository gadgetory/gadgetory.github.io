is the prototype this is what crazy
Russian has been hard at work on and I'm
very proud to present it so as you can
see uses a very similar painting color
scheme to the best of our one the big
difference is that we are using a bright
green paint as opposed to a bright red
paint so I just want to show you guys
the over well why don't we do it over
all run down to the machine so we've got
our course our 650d case and I'd like
the crazy Russian who is operating the
camera from you today to just come
around and have a look at it from this
side you can see the black accents look
really really sharp against that that
bright green paint color that we've got
on here you can see here are all your
ports and I rather not your ports your
hot-swap say today here in the top of
the case there we are up in the front
we've got our removable fan filter for
our front two hundred millimeter fan is
that a two hundred there's a one sixty I
can't remember it's a 200 okay so that's
four that we've got our blu-ray writer
here on the other side you can clearly
see we've got our two latches which once
again along with the border around the
window just really pop out also up here
we've got green LED Coolermaster fans
throughout the machine other than the
the large one in the front which doesn't
really make sense to try to replace I'm
going to take the side panel off let you
guys have a look at that really really
sharp looking and then now we get into
the inside of the machine so let's start
with the CPU we've got our 976 Core
processor that is going to be factory
overclocked but we haven't determined
the clock speeds yet that is to be
announced we've got 12 gigs of corsair
dominator memory running on our gigabyte
g1 sniper motherboard now the reason we
chose the sniper was that the assassin
is a non-standard form factor and
doesn't fit in this particular chassis
because it needs an extra pci slot and
then the gorilla doesn't have the
hardware creative x-fi sound or nearly
as beef
of an amplified built-in sound card so
that was why we went this route with the
killer Nick as well as the hardware
creative x5 sound card along with all
the other g1 features like lighting
beefy power design and just really cool
look I mean when you look at this it
basically looks like backup it basically
looks like there's a clip hanging out of
your graphics card which is sorry
magazine magazine I've been corrected
before so magazine by that okay moving
right along speaking of the graphics
card we've got our GTX 590 with three
gigs of graphics memory on it this
lighting actually complements the
overall build really well just love it
all of this is powered by a corsair ax
850 watt power supply and then we've
also got our corsair h 70 cooler with
the Coolermaster fans I'm not a big fan
of the Corsair fans that come with it so
we've gone ahead and replaced those for
looks as well as for better performance
and better silence so down here we've
got our Corsair oh I can't pull it out
because the wires are cable tied but
we've got a corsair 128 gig SATA 3 SSD
as well as a Western Digital 2 terabyte
black drive for storage so there's eos
drive
there's your storage drive and that
pretty much does it for specs now we
have a bit of a dramatic shot to show
you guys because i would like you to see
the message we won by the way there so
there's a little hint here this is where
I have my 3d vision surround projector
setup so yes we will be running the
Nesta g1 on the 3d vision surround
projector setup and yes you can come try
it the details are not finalized yet
we're gonna post them on Facebook but on
April 15th we are planning to have a
live event here at the warehouse where
you can come and I'm not sure how many
people are gonna come so I don't know
how long you'll be able to sit and play
but you'll be able to sit and play on
our triple projector setup with a Vesta
g1 and we may actually have a couple of
s 2d ones they're available for purchase
as well we might hold those ones just
for that one day thing so go ahead and
actually here I'll take I'll get the
lights and you go look at the system so
they can see that the dramatic lights
out shot
yeah yeah hopefully that looks good I'll
get turn off for more light so then I'll
be back okay okay after enough more like
there we go how's that so you can see
there's a little bit of glow coming out
the top the effect inside is fantastic
we've got our LED LED 12 inch lighting
guy down here and we've got one up here
we've got the LEDs on the fans as well
as the LEDs built into the g1 sniper
motherboard and then finally that lit
logo on the graphics card looks really
really cool when you have the system
built up like this you can see a little
bit of glow from the top but it's not
too pronounced so it shouldn't disturb
you while you're gaming thank you for
checking out this completed build
