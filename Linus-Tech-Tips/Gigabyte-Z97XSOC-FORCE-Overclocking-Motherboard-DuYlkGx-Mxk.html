motherboard overviews I have ever done
to start with most of these features are
things that I can't even validate
without sub-zero cooling and a lot more
overclocking skill than I possess and
things I've never had any need for so
most of you won't either
but the gigabyte z97 X SOC force does so
many things differently that I think it
merits a pretty in-depth video the CM
storm SF 17 uses a massive 18 centimeter
fan to cool your gaming notebook and it
adds a four port USB hub click now to
learn more included in the box are the
usual suspects including a manual driver
disk 2-way SLI bridge crossfire bridge
IO shield and four SATA cables then a
couple of things that are a little bit
more unique first up is adapters for the
voltage check points that can be used to
measure anything from standard stuff
like CPU core voltage to some obscure
stuff that I've never even heard of let
alone felt the need to measure and an OC
brace a metal bracket that supports your
expansion cards so they don't flop over
if you're testing on an open platform or
just putting it on top of the box neato
moving on to the board itself it
features a catchy orange and black color
scheme with a matte black PCB and silver
accents four gigabytes company branding
and ultra durable branding now in the
past gaming features and overclocking
features were often synonymous and any
high-end board would have the full
complement of both but this trend has
started to change somewhat with the
release of gaming boards that have no
CPU overclocking capabilities at all and
overclocking boards that gotta skimp on
the gaming stuff so with this board it's
somewhere in the middle and I'm gonna do
two separate physical tours one for the
general user and gaming features that
make the product usable for folks who
just want to build a normal PC with it
and one for the overclocking features
that only the hardcores are really gonna
care about so at the center of the board
is an LG
1150 socket with support for Haswell and
Haswell refresh Intel Core Series CPUs
with power provided by an 8 + 4 pin
power setup going through an eight
phase-- digital drm solution with custom
black capacitors rated to operate for
10,000 hours at 105 degrees Celsius they
collectively can handle up to 40 amps of
current to the CPU Wow
moving over we've got four ddr3 memory
slots that run in dual channel with
support for up to ddr3 33 hundred
megahertz memory listed on the spec
sheet and then next up is one of the
most feature dense chunks of motherboard
PCB that I have ever seen the on-board
debug display is great for reading post
codes and diagnosing random issues the
OC turbo button loads a pre-configured
overclocking profile for OneTouch basic
optimization the onboard power button is
great for folks like me who often use
boards without a case the clear CMOS
button lets you clear bad settings that
you are that are keeping the board from
booting and the dual BIOS which may save
your bacon if a BIOS update gets
interrupted at some point and you need
to rescue your board without sending it
in to be serviced everything else here
is very overclocking oriented so we'll
come back to it later the 24 pin power
is in its ideal location which leads us
to storage since there's not much else
to say about that we've got the option
to use either six standard SATA 3 16 bit
per second drives or four of those and a
single SATA Express 10 gigabit per
second drive SATA Express is a new
standard that is backwards compatible
with existing SATA drives but can use a
PCI Express over a cable for improved
latency and throughput there aren't
really any drives yet but when new
two-and-a-half-inch SSDs arrived using
this connector they will be able to
deliver better sequential performance
than previous models further down we've
got a couple of onboard USB ports these
are great for test bench juice or even
for normal use if you had something like
an encryption key or a USB bluetooth
adapter that you basically wanted to
have plugged in all the time and not
have it be in the way on the back of the
machine and then to the left to this
front USB 3 header isn't really great
but I understand why it's not on the
right with all the fancy stuff that's
going on
their front audio is plugged into the
standard header on the separated PCB
that makes up the bottom left on the
board you can tell that gigabyte has
physically separated the traces because
this blank PCB line will be illuminated
when the system is powered on this
slightly reduces interference for
cleaner onboard audio and that combined
with a pretty hefty amplifier and
Realtek ALC 1150 audio codec should make
the audio solution on the sport actually
pretty darn solid especially for an
overclocking oriented board next up
we've got PCI Express slots the board
supports four-way crossfire or two-way
SLI with a single PCIe 1x slot that will
get covered even if you just have a
single graphics card installed and then
a couple of old-school PCI slots
rounding out expansion of note here is
the 6 pin PCI Express female connector
above those slots that you'll want to
plug in if you're running more than two
graphics cards to make sure that you
don't burn out your 24-pin connector
rear i/o is pretty standard fare with 4
USB 2.0 ports VGA DVI DisplayPort and
HDMI output for the onboard video
optical audio out a ps2 keyboard mouse
combo port something I do still like to
see 4 USB 3 ports a killer e 2200
Gigabit LAN port that does support
networking prioritization and then
finally that 7.1 audio that I was
talking about before then shifting back
to the inside the onboard fan headers
are located here here here here here
here here and here so there are a total
of eight of them meaning that even some
of the most ludicrous systems actually
won't need to use anything outside of
the onboard headers to power up all the
fans which leads us pretty well into one
of the more exotic features of this
board here's one for you
OC ignition powers the motherboard and
connected components like fans while the
system shut down this is great for
maintaining air flow to combat
condensation and reduce cold bug issues
for extreme overclocking and it's also
great for building demo systems that
just need to look nice and look like
they're running but don't actually need
to work the OC tag button lets you
configure your
favorite customize settings in the BIOS
then apply them with OneTouch
the OC touch buttons let you manually
raise and lower the CPU multiplier base
clock speed and the rate at which they
change using hardware buttons the memory
safe button runs relaxed RAM timing
settings to help eliminate memory
compatibilities when you're first
booting up the boards you can get into
the BIOS and make changes speaking of
getting into the BIOS the direct to BIOS
button lets you boot right into the BIOS
without pressing delete when you boot up
the system the settings lock button
remembers your last successful settings
even if you clear the C Mouse which is
kind of cool so you can like you can
like override your settings and then you
can override clearing the override and
then there's like another one that
actually lets you override that by
that's the C bat switch by removing the
battery from the board just with a
button and doing a full clear so it's
like crazytown the dual BIOS which
enables or disables gigabytes dual BIOS
something I would suggest that you
actually leave on and then there's a
BIOS switch that lets you manually
switch between which physical BIOS chip
you are working off this can be great
for diagnosing issues and for analyzing
performance between multiple firmware
revisions the OC trigger switch lets you
boot up with a safe easy setting then
engage it to jump to an aggressive
frequency only during your benchmark run
and the PCI Express dip switches let you
turn the PCIe 16x slots on and off for
easy diagnosis of issues when running
multiple cards this is a fantastic
feature for water coolers as well as
extreme overclockers when it can be kind
of a bear to get a card out and find out
which one is causing the system to be
flaky and then they've got another
related one also dip switches but this
time for the dim slot so you can switch
slots on and off one at a time for
finding out which one runs the best or
for figuring out if there's a flaky
stick when you're doing diagnosis
without actually physically taking them
out so that's pretty much it other than
the usual gigabyte you know ultra
durable you know great build quality
thick copper PCB glass fabric humidity
resistance stuff thank you for watching
