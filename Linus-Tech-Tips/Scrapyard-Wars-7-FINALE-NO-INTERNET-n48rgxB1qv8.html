is with six sticks that they're getting
to 16 gigs of ram no I think it's 2
times 4 and then there are wait 2 times
4 would be and then I think there are 4
yeah 4 - is that what you said for 2
days
yeah sorry yeah I think that's it oh so
that means only the first 8 gigs are at
quad-channel speed actually I don't know
if this generation even worked like that
I might be better off pulling out the
the two mismatched ones we're gonna see
if we can get a deal on this stuff to
make it like properly make sense because
the pricing differences between the two
are very close so I'll see what we can
do
could you do a power supply and the 954
90 bucks
I know it's a little rough but the the
original power supply you offer me was
the eight hundred and seventy five watt
so if I take one of the lower wattage
joints yeah yeah same place so we can
choose waiver no oh okay
yeah I was just saying if I took a worse
power supply from the used bin maybe
that could make more sense okay all
right
what can you do for me I mean I want to
I need a power supply and I want to go
with the 950 if possible I can't make it
I had your dollars a hundred bucks yeah
okay yeah let's do that they've got two
thousand dollars to build the best bang
for the buck PC but they have to do it
without internet they've got three days
to do it and on the fourth day we find
out who the winner is in this edition
scrapyard Wars brought to you by D brand
so Keith wasn't able to help me out
personally but to their credit this has
been about the smoothest experience I've
ever had setting up a scrapyard wars
pewter I threw in my drive-thru in my
graphics card popped my install media in
and Windows is installed I was really
worried that 60 gigs might cause Windows
tend to throw a little fit but
apparently it's above the minimum so
it's a bit of a concern that even though
this is a 3.7 gigahertz processor we're
sitting at ninety percent literally
installing a dotnet framework patch and
a game on Steam
pathetic games his launcher really used
that much CPU what so there was tax I
was kind of hoping it was gonna charge
me tax but you know that's good be legal
all that kind of stuff it ended up at a
price of about a hundred and twelve
dollars which if I bought it at full
price without a discount it would have
been a hundred and ten so I basically
got tax removed by a tiny little bit of
haggling so now we need to return the
CPU cooler and try to get someone to buy
at least the hard drive that will
probably have to be done tomorrow
because I think we're pretty close to at
a time so I'm not the most confident
with that decision because it's a pretty
low-end graphics card but realistically
due to how the testing is laying out
Cinebench is one third of the total
score so buying a really overpriced
graphics card could really throw my
scores out of whack
so I went with the cheaper card
hopefully it's okay so we're going back
into Canada computers to return the CPU
cooler and I'm also going to try to
peddle my wares for performance oh this
is all I'm returning yeah yeah hasn't
been taken over the box if there's tape
on it the tapes still there so I have a
question I'm assuming your answer is
gonna be no but the computer that I
bought I was able to pull some hardware
out of it these things in the bag are
junk and worth nothing I could tell from
the bag yeah there's a there's a DVD
drive and a 350 watt power supply and of
Wi-Fi dongles none of that matters I do
have a brand new two terabyte hard drive
though hey you trying to train for
something I'm trying to sell them to you
okay Selvam yeah yeah okay so I found a
guy to buy the hard drive and my mystery
bag components which is the DVD drive
power supply and wireless card his name
is Liam I'm giving them the hard drive
for 25 bucks which is a pretty killer
deal and then the mystery bag for 10
which is much less of a killer deal but
35 bucks for me which helps a lot so
here's all your stuff which I guess is
gonna be annoying to hold will use the
money oh no that's so good there you go
and you can count that 20 25 35 perfect
there we go
thank you very much oh there you go very
much have a good one we are leaving now
to go back to the office because we are
done the computer at the office works
and we just returned the cooler which
saved us $20 and add a computer store I
was able to find someone someone random
and I sold all of that for $35 so it's
day four we've got a system already I'm
really not used to this and all that is
left is to see if there's any
optimization and tuning that we can do
to squeeze out some better benchmark
scores okay so everything should be in
the advanced tuning tab I actually
haven't really used extreme tuning
utility before so okay in a big surprise
to no one the multiplier is not unlocked
it is really looking like there is not
gonna be a whole lot that we can do in
here okay I'm trying not to be
disappointed by this I mean I did say it
was gonna be similar to a core i7 3770
can do is we can pull out those oddball
memory sticks go back down to eight gigs
and see if having some of our RAM
running in dual channel or something was
affecting performance this is
interesting so now we're up to 659 that
is a significant improvement before it
was 637 so we have gained a total of 25
points already which might not seem like
a lot but when you've only gotten 600
now we're gonna shut it down again and
we're gonna find out if in our workloads
where we don't really need four channels
worth of memory bandwidth
we would actually be better off with the
latency advantage of just two sticks
because eight gigs of ram should be
enough for all of our workloads and
there we have it we have made up the
difference between our CPU and the 3771
Cinebench point and all we had to do was
go down from quad-channel memory to dual
channel memory I think we're probably
gonna run everything with eight gigs
25.40 one-stop our score hardly changed
at all setting our GPU to be overclocked
I don't even know if it actually turned
out any higher so we've got a frame rate
counter up here one quick way to have a
look at what your sort of CPU bottleneck
is is to look at something not very
graphically demanding like off into the
distance so it looks like we're limited
to probably around or the stuff of a
skybox around 200 frames per second max
then what we want to do is we want to
put ourselves in a position where
there's a bunch of characters character
models tend to be some of the most
demanding things to render so let's jump
out and let's let's get near some
character models and see how that
affects things is changing the
resolution to 4k and seeing how that
affects it that will actually tell us a
lot about how CPU bottlenecks we are
show me a big FPS drop
oh okay that's not as big as I would
have liked but we're also not quite as
CPU limited as I might have thought we
would be to our GPU usage okay no we're
pretty bottlenecked so our GPU is only
sitting at around 70% tops at 1080 and
it's had a hundred percent at 4k and our
CPU usage yeah you can see it's really
using up to three full cores or more and
then CPU usage drops down to not being a
bottleneck at all at 4k so if we were
running at something like 1440 we'd
really be getting the most out of our
hardware okay
here's a nearby landscape we're at about
a hundred and eighty going back down to
1080 200-plus okay landscapes good
buildings bad
how about trees okay so here's some
trees over 200
160 trees very good
so basically pure GPU let's look at
grass 150 190 ok grass good trees good
I'm like here 120 looking at an actual
you know more representative of gameplay
scene here's my problem we prank that to
1440p 120 no difference whatsoever
whereas if we went down to 1080 but we
cranked it to epic a hundred FPS now
we're GPU limited and if we go and we
look at afterburner our GPU usage has
spiked up to around 90%
I wish we were running at 1080 high even
1440 high that the system to do it so I
ran into a minor problem where you can
see the power supply fits in the case
it's in there but this metal tab was in
the way because the old power supply was
short so this was flipped over and in
the case and blocking the power spike
from Gabino go to the back because it's
a full size power supply now I realized
once I slide it to the back it doesn't
fit in naturally you try to put it up
here and get stopped by some metal
that's in the case and the it the holes
don't line up I could force it to if I
like got rid of a bunch of metal that
was in the case or I could just drill
new holes in the back and this mount it
where it is either of those options
would be fine both of them take time of
which we don't really have right now so
my plan right now is to present the
computer in the orientation that it is
which is upside down but uh who cares
about based on aesthetics so time to
move on ok so I need to figure out how
much money we actually spent I still
have a lot of this lesson ok this is
this is what I have left which is like
yeah that's that's a lot which is good I
guess I have to go through receipts now
so this was the CPU cooler but I need to
just ignore that because that was
returned the best works eat that matters
okay the SSD that matters and the power
supply and graphics card that matters
and then I need to consider the $35 that
I gained if I just ignore the receipts
for the cooler that's fine because we
essentially just never did that
so calculator 203 point 16 plus 1/12
plus
fifty point two six equals three hundred
sixty-five dollars forty two cents - 35
bucks
equals three hundred and thirty dollars
and 42 cents
I'm at like a 50/50 percent confidence
whether or not I'm gonna win but I'm
pretty happy with what we were
accomplished anyways because that is a
pretty bangin computer for three hundred
thirty bucks and 42 cents especially
considering we had no access to the
Internet I think it's pretty good okay
okay are we telling each other anything
for are we telling each other how much
we spent I think we should at least take
out the bit take off the veils
oh so the wavelet okay so the way the
spreadsheet is structured I'm not that
good with conditional formulas so we
enter the first two scores and there's a
conditional formula that says if score
number three is zero then zero so we
don't get like a div divided by zero
error and then once we enter the third
scores then we get a relative
performance score populated then we
enter the prices and the performance per
dollar gets populated oh it can be done
better than that but it doesn't matter
yeah this was the
you know while Luke was running off to
Barnaby I liked it whatever it was
okay so we're unveiling sure okay
they're both surprisingly normal except
mine is upside down yeah yours has yours
has a case so that's an improvement over
that one previous scrapyard worse Oh
interesting
a what where did you find one of these
oh oh did I leave the price tag on the
back there am I supposed to see that I
don't know
I'm assuming you didn't pay that much
I apparently have a lot of extra ham hey
hey hey careful now this is some this is
this is a thing that could have been
properly installed if I if I spent more
time yeah okay got that VGA going on
there this is a Windows I think is that
10 or 8.1 I can't not a hundred percent
on that sticker I think this is Windows
10 though so I've got a pretty good idea
I think of what's going on here do you I
would bet that you can't guess what it
is what do you think it is I won't
confirm or deny but what do you know no
no I want to be surprised I want to be I
want to be completely surprised oh did
you like my round collage that was a
that was quite beautiful to collage I
made it he didn't try to sell them I
mean I sold over oh I sold like four
pieces of me interesting okay well
that'll that'll be interesting be cool
alright
higher up yeah
okay so those French no wait yeah yeah
handle Kyosho
okay
okay so there's one a CAF machine and
one Lenovo I was I was worried that it
might show a certain thing but it didn't
okay all right so first up Cinebench I
actually haven't loaded that yet it's
downloaded okay okay I think watching
this extraction performance here
probably gonna go pretty slow
that is pretty slow it's actually slower
than I expected
that's very slow I bet you can't guess
what I have in there Zeon I don't know
preachers of Zeon is it I think I saw it
on the oh no I just had Intel I don't
know on your mark get set
Cinnabons I'm pretty pretty fun missile
scrapyard Wars is brought to you by D
brand their new Nintendo switch convey
Lebel now and you can also order
tempered glass screen protectors these
things look great they're crystal clear
and they're durable you could even keep
your switch in your pocket with your
keys if you wanted to I actually have
big enough pockets that I could do that
look at that see those are big pockets
learn more at the link below
oh yeah this score will be pretty bad oh
no that was the first square that
started that just finished oh oh okay
I think a gamble that I made might have
paid off here but it comes down to price
to performance that's why I'm not
necessarily freaking out yet I'm still a
little bit freaking out but like I'm not
entirely gone at the moment alright
how did you end up with change I just
need to alright do that wait I need to
find my phone sorry one sec I decided to
yeah I had to pull my phone out of all
my money sorry
it's a difficult life so what's your
score people say Mo Money mo problems I
didn't realize finding your phone would
be part of it okay okay yeah I'll cover
it too
this is gonna be really bad okay 668 299
that doesn't have me too freaked out yet
I have a lot of money more than double
the sin avenge score okay I'm gonna get
my my spreadsheet here I need my laptop
Cinebench lioness 668 is that what I
said hold on don't look at 668 so the
hold on hold on hold on I'm verifying
for the for the camera here there it is
668 okay and Luke your score was I
believe 299 checking yep 299 alright
that's pretty close to the price of my
computer okay are you ready to run well
walk as it were yeah three two one
leisurely stroll begins now this is the
like smell the flowers computer yeah and
all your money because it smells like
maples there's the smell the burning
rubber computer if this is anything
other than pure storage okay
my storage is not that fast
that's higher than I was hoping mr.
moneybags
[Laughter]
really want it that's the thing that's
why I was wondering if we should reveal
the price beforehand no because this is
so blind this is very blind this entire
competition from the start you can't use
the internet you can't use maps and the
price is flexible is it has been such
like a blind competition hold that
thought do you have a paper map I don't
think I would have been able to find
what I was trying to find even if I had
a paper map so I don't think it would
have made a difference okay weird so you
can't use certain kinds of maps where
did you get a phone book oh that is
awesome
that is great it's huge that is what she
said and that is half of the lower
people heads gas station did the phone
book too
that was a long crease debris I'm gonna
make you watch that one oh yeah okay
that's fair so you're allowed to use
maps does not electronic one woof that
one's pretty slow that's not pretty
no that one is pretty slow
but what I'm really wondering is if I
spent too much the fact that he's
running around selling stuff is a bit of
a wild card I sold a Oh does it no it
doesn't nope we're good so I have to be
under half your cost I guess that's the
whole thing right now
yeah so we'll have to see how that lines
up okay so three so unsure
- thirteen five one nine and Luke five
to one sex it only sort of all comes
down to this because we don't know we
don't know the price what the other one
paid I am starting to worry on that
front though based on this ticker that I
saw in the back but we'll see
one thing I'd evey ated from all medium
on was view distance I don't fall medium
all medium
what were you doing I'm gonna cry
gonna have my phone breacher you said hi
though 1080 hi sure I don't I think
that's probably better for you at this
point okay so things I changed I turned
motion blur off because motion blur is
garbage and I set view distance to epic
because you should never play a
competitive game without maximum distro
you said hi okay that's fine I just
clicks the hi button okay so fine fine
fine
I'm down with emotional they're off yeah
right cuz that's a standard we've like
literally always had alright I think you
distance is pretty important for tonight
but you know if we die because of that's
a lot higher than me you know
there we go you ready three two one go
do you want to jump and where do you
want to go go anywhere you want call it
let's go to that part of the lake okay
three two one go so we're going to the
top of the lungs like the little tree oh
crap you're driving really fast which
one the one at the very corner that tree
okay I see you you're a little bit in
front of me I think being in the air has
an advantage you're not even kidding
it's mine so I hope I didn't dive too
fast oh yeah these things take forever
to hit the ground and I don't know how
to make it go any faster I think if you
go forward it goes down a bit faster I'm
not sure though okay I'm following right
behind you who I'm trying to follow
right behind you okay so you know what
you lead I'll follow most enthralling
benchmark ever I hold on a second that
means I have a model in my screen and
you don't
okay let's just take these you take the
one on the right
oh sure okay
and then we'll chop the big one together
yeah okay
teamwork makes the dream work
keep running straight sure okay why
don't we go eat that yeah just making
sure I'm in your screen here there's go
okay this red barn there's got to be
something in this area
fine go a little bit more into my screen
there you
oh the benchmarks over is it oh wait how
long did you set yours for three minutes
180 seconds yeah unless I didn't check
the checkbox oh that's fine we can still
we can still figure it out don't mean it
join hok saltado
I might not have checked the like stop
benchmark after box yeah I didn't I'm
apparently pretty rusty what's gonna
happen when we enter these values is
it's gonna give us a total relative
score okay so it's like out of tanning
all of these I'm assuming right out of a
hundred yeah yeah and it's the highest
score is 100 yep okay oh one forty seven
point seven eight and then sixty seven
point eight seven well that's better
than I thought it was gonna be watching
it running fine yeah yeah I knew that
one no I mean it's worse than I thought
it was gonna be oh I sit for me that
makes sense okay so tense right now how
I copy okay
okay so here we go I am pasting them
paste special paste values only okay so
yeah so it's not if I if you spent half
as much you're done yeah but if you
spent a third as much
I got slayed okay how much did you spend
should we should we say what's in it
first and then so much Salman kruseman
sure all right all right
do you want to crack my panel first here
comes the panel crack I will say one
thing before we even open this up yeah
this is cool and I'm happy you got it
cuz that's pretty cool the second I saw
it I was like alright that's pretty
sweet
I definitely never saw any of these on
my travels what the heck
Oh what is that what card is that I'm
running the that price tag why didn't
you have that rabbit that price tag had
some of the information oh I might have
thrown it away but it's a if I recall
correctly
it's a Zeon 1620 v2 it's a quad core
eight thread three point seven gigahertz
my power supply is better than yours is
80 plus gold sighs a lot actually not
that it matters at all three point seven
gigahertz Ivy Bridge so it's basically a
3772 at least it was once I removed this
Ram so quad channel has a bandwidth
advantage but dual channel has a latency
advantage so it came with 16 gigs two by
four and four by two so I'm just running
eight gigs around because for the
benchmarks were running I don't need
this and that's why I didn't sell it
because I was testing those scenarios up
till today other than that it is stock
Lenovo workstation other than the x1 10
60 gig SSD 60 gig how much does that
cost you 10 bucks oh my god I thought I
got a really good SSD deal apparently
not and this I don't even have the other
drive plugged in everything fit this is
a gtx 1070 how much did that cost you
I'm not gonna tell you that just yet
that could um hopefully make me happy
okay okay I don't know though all right
well it's upside down I think I have
some idea what it is because I went to
Best Buy
and they had to
they had to guess what it is I think
it's a 7800 a 10 yeah
damn it we thought about that too I was
like they wouldn't tell I called the
check stock how much do you think I got
it for 269 okay that's not right but Oh
interesting
Louis like pretty far off by like
actually a lot like I'm not not even
kidding
am i lying Brandon these chickens it ok
that's potentially a problem I do have a
dope power spot okay and my SSD cost
like four times as much as yours okay
I don't know your graphics graphics card
was looking impossible sorry yes coughs
card was very hard graphic card is that
where you were in Burnaby today no just

card for so a 1050 new was like a
hundred and sixty dollars or something

spent 77033 - oh my god you won what
score per price wait I think my formula
might be broke I didn't used to better

things be better because I'm pretty sure
I needed to beat you by more than that
in terms of price I think you won I
think you just did to form Hiller oh

ya higher would be better hold on a
second
h3 over I 3 h2 over I - yeah cuz all the
scores are off by more than half

five dollars on top of mine oh no you're
done you're done it 365 for sure
