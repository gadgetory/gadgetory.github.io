journey of mine to build the quietest PC
possible my old TJ o7 build used to
radiators so that I could run my fans at
just 600 rpm and my current setup has
the PC literally in a different room
with a cable running through the wall
but that is both expensive and kind of a
pain in the butt what if there was
another way a way that looks super cool
but that may or may not be even more
expensive and with even more butt pain
I'm gonna tell you about it but first
something that comes with no butt pain
the be quiet dark bass 700 is a
versatile case that features RGB
lighting and a tempered glass side panel
check it out in the link below to learn
more
so this idea was actually pitched months
ago in a writers brainstorming meeting
when well let's just say we got totally
off topic discussing old computer
hardware memes but instead of making a
cage made of fans we should do a case
made of radiator right and it should
have no fans at all yes well somehow
that made it on to the production
calendar with the original plan actually
being to basically no actually - exactly
just jury-rigged together every radiator
in the warehouse with some L brackets we
had lying around and zip-tie in a
motherboard power supply and graphics
card that got canned pretty quickly and
the project devolved into its second
form a bunch of radiators attached with
L brackets and some metal mounting
brackets for the internal hardware
courtesy of our friends with the machine
shop that totally isn't the only reason
we hang out with them after school proto
case then by this point if we're gonna
get some custom mounting hardware we
might as well create our own frame for
the radiators right yeah obviously so it
was off to Autodesk Inventor where a
bunch of time was spent measuring and
mocking up the brackets required for our
build as well as for the case frame
itself we ended up with a shape that's
actually sort of reminiscent of a PC
case but without front fascia or side
panels or a bottom I guess it is - a
case kind of what a go-cart frame is to
a car but these feet that we got from
them and PC tech er pretty cool and
anyway it's perfect for our purposes
since it is perfectly sized for eks
ultra thick XC series radiators in the
three sixty millimeter variant and then
it's also got another spot on the back
for the three by three 120 millimeter
rad that we've had sitting around unused
in the warehouse since 2013 for style
points for this build we went with
hardline tubing using fittings for all
of the bends giving us a finish
product that I wouldn't think would be
beautiful to most people in like a
traditional sense but that has a raw
industrial look to it that I personally
absolutely love and the real story here
isn't beauty anyway but rather pushing
the limits of performance and cooling so
let's take a look then at the insane
specs that we loaded it up with for
testing we started with 18 cores
of pure Intel Core I 9 pala then we
threw in 64 gigs of quad-channel sodium
ddr4 from g.skill 64 gigs and a whopping
3 by 960 gigs of nvme SSD raid zero
goodness though we actually ended up
needing those high-capacity drives for
another project but there are 240 gig
siblings look pretty much the same oh
and then we threw in a GTX 1080 because
come on what I nine rig doesn't have a
bitchin GPU finally at the heart of all
that the way that we fit this much
radiator power into this much space was
as Rox brand new X 299 II ITX with a
custom bits power full cover block that
thankfully replaces the micro sized vrm
cooler on this puppy
okay then enough about that how does it
perform we decided to test our creation
a couple of different ways first with no
fans in it at all except for the one
that was built into our Silverstone 800
watt modular SF XL power supply and that
idle putt mission accomplished our temps
were near ambient with our pump handling
all of these radiators like a champ with
that said a system like this when it's
not doing anything doesn't kick out a
lot of heat so we added a CPU load
measured the results and ended up even
more impressed even at this power level
we are easily dissipating all of the
heat and keeping our processor at a safe
temperature but then what about the
graphics card
ha no problem so I think at this point
it's safe to call the project a success
it should be noted that the fan in the
power supply did spin up while gaming
adding to the noise already being made
by our d5 pump but thanks to the massive
radiator surface area this is still
among the quietest systems we have ever
encountered even at full load and
perhaps the coolest thing about it is
that by borrowing a page from the build
that originally inspired it we can take
it of course to a completely new level
now we weren't able to fit fans onto all
of the radiator spots but even running
at a low rpm we ended up with some
seriously impressive cooling results
so then conclusion I guess if this was a
product sent to us by a manufacturer
asking for an objective review what
would we say well in this exact
configuration we're looking at almost
$1200 worth of water cooling hardware so
we'd start by saying that you might want
to think about saving a few bucks by
using soft tubing at the very least but
we'd also say that you cannot question
the performance of what is effectively
an 18 by 120 millimeter radiator setup
and you can't question the fact that it
not only ran passively but also did so
with performance that wasn't far off
what you'd expect from decent
aftermarket cooling systems so it's not
a great value but it's definitely rad oh
that's awful
we have partnered with Tesoro to give
away 10 limited-edition Graham spectrum
keyboards modded by the people over at
modders Inc simply vote for your top 3
limited-edition designs and be entered
to win one of these keyboards who knows
maybe the most popular design will be
produced as a magnetic overlay for more
people to enjoy as well on their grand
spectrum keyboards also if you purchase
a gram spectrum keyboard through the
link below before the end of the
holidays you'll receive two magnetic
overlays like this one to quickly and
easily mod your keyboard without any
hassle so check it out and get more
