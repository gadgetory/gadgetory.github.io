age to 20
we had a 20 degree difference between
our noctua and ff12 fans and the swift
tech helix fans now we thought those
results were pretty suspect at the time
but we rerun them a few times the
problem though is that we made a
critical error we were using naktu as
low-speed adapters on all of the fans
and in the past it's never been an issue
because we've always just run knocked to
a fence but what we discovered is that
while the low-speed adapters which we
thought were just your standard sort of
under volt from 12 volt to nine volt
sort of adapters we thought everything
was hunky-dory what we discovered is
that while it'll tone these guys down
from around 1,400 rpm to around 1,100
rpm it turned swift Tex helix fans all
the way down from 1800 rpm to 600 rpm so
the helix fans to get that 20 degree
difference we're actually running at
half of the RPM of the Noctua fans not
only that but the Swift tech fans were
only run with the pump at full speed and
what we found out is that our units here
may actually be not quite optimal in
terms of their performance because these
are early samples that are not using
Swift Tech's new vacuum filling
procedure that basically amounts to zero
air bubbles inside the system so we
might have had air bubbles that we're
getting caught in the pump causing the
performance to degrade with the pump
running at full speed which might be
part of why we got our best results when
running the pump at half speed so we're
waiting for a retail unit of the h2 20
and so that we can actually take it and
retest it in a number of different
configurations so we're gonna run our
noctua fans at 600 rpm to see how
comparable that is just you know let's
see what happens if we cripple both fans
we're gonna run our knock - offends at
1100 rpm which is our standard testing
procedure then we're gonna run Swift Tex
fans at 600 rpm again with the new fixed
unit all with the pump at half because
that doesn't seem to affect performance
much and then we're gonna run Swift text
unit at 1100 rpm then we're gonna take
some additional fans we're going to
some gentle typhoons some gelid wings
some air penetrator 121 we're gonna run
all of those at 1100 rpm this is all in
a pull configuration because that's the
configuration that I prefer to use we've
added something to our test bench here
that we didn't have before so check it
out we have a variable fan speed
controller in the front so we can use
software to exactly monitor the RPMs of
the fans and fine-tune them to make sure
that noise levels and rpm levels are the
same and then last but not least Swift
Tech has also asked us to test theirs in
a push configuration which is the way it
ships stock and to also try using PWM
control for the whole unit itself
because part of the problem may be that
Swift Tech's fans are not designed for
voltage control but are designed for PWM
control using a four pin connector and a
compatible PWM chipset so we're gonna
plug everything into the CPU fan header
and then we're gonna plug both fans and
the pump into Swift X PWM splitter and
then report that result as well and on
that one we're gonna target 1100 rpm for
the fans so this should give us the most
complete and clear picture of how the
Swift tech cooler performs now I'm just
gonna take a little while to get this
done so that's why I'm releasing this
video so you guys know that it's coming
but in the meantime remember guys our
result with it performing better than
everything else is still valid because
this engineering sample unit had
everything going against it and with the
Noctua cooler compared to every other
liquid cooler that we've tested due to
its copper radiator compared to the
aluminum finned radiators that are used
in other low-cost solutions due to just
the overall design of the unit the
better pump the better see swift tech
designed base plate dramatically better
design dramatically better performance
than other low-cost coolers it is the
best performing cooler on the market if
you add aftermarket fans we just need to
do more investigation into the stock
ones that are included thanks for
