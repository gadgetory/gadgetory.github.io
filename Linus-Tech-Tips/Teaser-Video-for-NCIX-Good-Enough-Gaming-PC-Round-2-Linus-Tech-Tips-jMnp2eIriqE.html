actually had any number of people
request a new yes I got a copy of Vegas
I will no longer be using Windows Live
Movie Maker cameraman finds that very
amusing evidently okay I am going to be
doing a remake of the good enough gaming
system which this original video was
released on the NCI ex-con channel in
standard death got about a hundred
thousand views in on August 23rd 2007
the dates here left there yeah okay so I
have gotten a ton of requests to redo
this with more modern hardware so I've
actually decided not only to do that but
also to kick things up a notch and I'm
going to be doing two systems so I'm
going to do one with my original good
enough gaming goal which was a six
hundred dollar system so let's walk you
through what I'm gonna be using for that
this is all stuff that I've shopped for
on the NCIX site and our weekly special
this week so no guarantees you'll find
exactly this deal but there are no
that's there for a reason what are you
deaf
what do you think what she's doing
that's there for a reason okay so now
I've completely lost my train of thought
right so you usually find deals of this
caliber although you might not find
exactly the same one so the first thing
I've got here for my good enough gaming
system is a core i3 2100 processor with
a gigabyte h61 motherboard
I went Super Value low-end on the
motherboard and for the processor I've
gone with a dual core because the
reality of it is most of the games out
there are still gonna run just fine on a
dual core I went with four gigs of RAM
because for 39.99 - a $5 Mir how can you
say no the GTX 460 one gig especially
with an additional 25 bucks off with a
mail-in rebate and a free copy of Hawkes
- and a free NCIX $10 gift card that
comes with it is a smokin good deal so
that works out to just under 150 bucks
for a great gaming graphics card the 300
at 50 to 99 - a 20 Mir is a well
ventilated gaming chassis it's pretty
you know basic but it is what it is
we're trying to hit a price point here I
not have enough budget for an SSD so
I've gone with a $40.00 Western Digital
caviar blue 500 gig I did not go with
the green even though they're cheap
because green drives are not really
suitable for OS drive use I have a DVD
writer I've gone with Windows 7 home
premium and a true power new 650 watt
power supply normally this would not fit
in my budget for a $600 machine but it
has a $30 Mir on it so down here at the
bottom I can see that my cart total is
six hundred and ninety three dollars and
ninety two cents I have $80 in MI RS and
I have a ten dollar NCIX gift card that
comes with that
that MSI graphics card so I basically
treat that as cash so I went just over
my $600 target and if you know someone
if you already have a copy of Windows 7
then you can save yourself a hundred
bucks there it becomes a $500 gaming
machine now for comparison I want to
take this value gaming machine and put
it up against what you can build for
about a thousand bucks so here we've got
an i-5 2500 K so we've gone from a
dual-core to a quad core processor we've
gone from the tipo h61 board to a p67
board that is sli ready crossfire ready
and capable of overclocking we've gone
from four gigs to eight gigs of ram
we've gone all the way up to a GTX 570
zero C we've upgraded the chassis
because most people you see spending a
thousand bucks on a gaming system are
gonna be buying a decent chassis the 932
is definitely a very decent chassis
especially for after a 20 dollar mir
around a hundred bucks we've gotten with
the same power supply because it's such
a good deal at for 39.99 the true power
650 is just a ridiculous deal so it's
fully capable of supporting that GTX 570
so that's what I'll be doing I can't
afford an SSD on this machine so I'm
going with an OCD vertex 260 gig and
then I'm gonna go with the caviar green
for storage because you can cheap out on
the drive because it's just for storage
Green is fine for that finally I've got
a DVD writer same as the other one in
Windows Home some windows 7 home premium
for 100 bucks and so my total - a
hundred and ten dollars of Mir comes to
about 1250 3-1
10 - another 10 bucks so just over $1100
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
build both of these machines for you
guys and I'm gonna compare our good
enough gaming machine to what you would
get if you spend just under twice as
much don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips fron boxing's in computer
videos and don't forget to subscribe to
my NCIX comm channel so that when we
release this video you will be there to
see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
