to controllers there are so many on the
market that it's hard for them to
impress and easy for them to just piss
me off
perfect example let's take a trip down
memory lane and check out some of the
highlights from my high perk in retron 5
review from 2014 speaking of the
included controller it's garbage
mocchi acceptable straight-up puke
worthy it squeaks when you spin it
obstruction rinds against the stick
unpleasant horrible feeling abysmal
latency funky blah latency issues comes
with a controller which will just add
mass to landfills so yeah make any
controller and I'm not going to shy away
from calling you out especially if it's
wireless but make a great controller and
an impressive wireless solution and you
have my complete and undivided attention
this is analog and 8-bit DOS retro
receiver for NASA and snez along with
8-bit dough's matching controllers and
let me tell you they've got my attention
and they should have yours too let's
find out why
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade
make it yours at the link below input
devices are like tools you should use
the right one for the right job when you
can a keyboard or mouse isn't generally
the greatest experience for a racing
game and a racing wheel while it would
be fun in a silly way if you can get it
to work is just an idiotic pairing for a
game like counter-strike go continuing
this theme I prefer to play platformers
with smaller retro-inspired controllers
that don't have extraneous things I
don't need joysticks specifically I
really like nests and snez controllers
now both of the 8-bit dough controllers
which will cover more deeply later on
can officially connect with iOS Mac OS
Android and Windows through a simple
Bluetooth connection which will allow
you to play new platformers various
d-pad based games and more including the
morally grey area of emulated games but
first I want to take a moment to look at
their retro receivers for both the Ness
and thus Ness these compact little
devices look like someone just clipped
the cable off of the plug end of a
controller and added a little micro USB
port a sync button and a light which in
my opinion looks great functionality
wise they're surprisingly flexible they
can be plugged into a Playstation 3 a PC
or a Mac through microUSB and uses a
high quality just straight bluetooth
adapter or they can be plugged into an
original ness or snez unit an analogue
NT or some other form of aftermarket
Nasser's ness that uses the original
plugs cool once you've got all that
hooked up you can then officially pair
it with PlayStation 4 controllers
PlayStation 3 controllers wiimotes Wii U
pro controller z' and various 8-bit doe
controllers and arcade sticks they
transmit data over bluetooth 2.1 + edr
class 2 and the experience is I'm happy
to say fantastic with minimal latency
unlike that terrible terrible retron
controller let's jump back now to a more
in-depth look at the 8-bit doe
controllers along with the wicked
connectivity options that I mentioned
above
most importantly the nest 30 and snez
three do something that many have failed
to achieve they feel right
with the perfect retro inspired gray
ribbon cable attached I think you could
convince most people in a blind taste
test that this was the real thing and if
you're any good with Nasser's nest
controllers this helps with more than
just pseudo authenticity I mean the
classic controllers made by Nintendo
were good for a reason not just because
they were original but because they were
responsive and felt right like the games
were specifically designed to be played
with them and it helps that they were
relatively hard to break - something
that I don't intend to benchmark but
seems to be true with these replicas as
well but back to new functionality in
order to cover all of the bases 8-bit
dough has included a variety of modes in
which the controller can run including a
touchscreen emulation mode where you can
drag and drop input pass throughs so
that your inputs to the controller
translate into inputs to the game which
can be a huge benefit because I hate
playing anything but turn-based games on
mobile due to crappy touchscreen input
and you get some other goodies like
multiplayer support on iOS and the nest
30 even including a clip on the back
called the X Tanner which you can remove
to prop up your phone
this shouldn't be confused with the
other X stander which clips onto your
controller and your phone sort of
mimicking an Nvidia shield this product
with the exact same name is totally
different obviously but if Linus tech
tips was going to let crappy product
naming hurt our overall rating of a
product the Razer Blade would be the
worst laptop three years running and it
isn't so all in all I wasn't even sure
if I was going to review these but after
spending time with them they just work
they feel like NASA's nest controllers
they can be wired or wirelessly
transmitted with the retro receiver they
can even be used with the original or
aftermarket nest source nest devices
which I like to use along with modern
computers smartphones and even a
Playstation 3 if you're more into that
so great work and Allah
an 8-bit doe there isn't really much
more I can think to ask from these
products so I guess I'll end with that
today we're talking about I fix its
protec toolkit it's been completely
reimagined but it's just as rugged and
portable as before it includes the new
64-bit driver kit which replaced the
former 54 bit driver kit and there are
tons of magnets the 64 bit kit itself is
held to the front role using magnets and
as the shell is able to be taken off
with magnets as well it can be used as a
like parts tray there's also a newly
redesigned swivel top precision driver
which I personally like a lot and the
Flex extension that you know from before
for hard-to-reach places there's
precision ESD safe tweezers including a
pair of reverse tweezers and a wider
variety of plastic opening tools and
picks to safely work on tablets and
smartphones in certain iOS devices and
whatnot and you're backed by I fix its
lifetime warranty and if you're like
whatever man I already own one just go
check out their guides they have tons of
guides on tearing down a huge amount of
electronics so ifixit.com slash Linus
and use code LTT at your checkout to say
$5 on your purchase of $10 or more
thanks for watching guys if you liked
this video like it if you just like this
video dislike it if you want to buy
products like these checking on Amazon I
don't actually know if these are on sale
on Amazon but they might be I'm not
entirely sure if you want to see some
links view description down below of
like where to buy a shirt or something
those should be there as well and check
out this video if you want to see the
old retron 5 review thanks for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
