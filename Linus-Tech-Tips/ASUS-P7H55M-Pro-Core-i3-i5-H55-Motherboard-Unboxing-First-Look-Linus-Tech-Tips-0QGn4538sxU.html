55 board this one is for masseuse and
the first thing that you can tell about
it is that design matters this is a
replacement logo for the one that they
have on their whatever it is extreme
something or other that includes USB 3.0
whatever it's a similar looking logo and
basically what they're saying is that
engineering is important which it is
from other boards because if it's not
engineered well it won't work very well
okay so this board also includes HDMI
DVI GPU boost ddr3 2133 support that's
pretty cool for like a micro ATX
entry-level board and turbo v it is
Windows 7 ready
it supports LGA 1156 socket CPUs and
that includes core i7 core i5 and core
i3 so there we go that pretty much
covers that here they've got a quick Oh
actually this is kind of neat ok so
instant IGP you level boot level up so
they take the integrated GPU in real
time and boost it for the best graphics
performance so if you actually care
about the graphics performance of your
onboard CPU on the core i3 or Core i5
dual core then this is how you will be
able to take advantage of it it also has
a turbo key which allows for easy it's
an overclocking button ok alright ok
well why don't we get this thing open
and we'll have a have a quick look at it
so this is a pro board so it's not one
of their most basic oh I'm losing
accessories here you know what give me
just like two seconds I'm gonna go ahead
and adjust my camera down so you can see
what I'm doing here you know what I
might even use the zoom today check that
out so you'll be able to see better Wow
how about that ok then I have
accessories so inside we will find two
SATA cables one straight and one right
angle then we will find one IDE cable
now seriously personally I would rather
see another couple SATA cables because
how many people are really using IDE
drives with the needs of these days
alright then we got an i/o shield then
we have a user's guide which also
includes a DVD that has all your drivers
and whatnot don't use any of this
download the latest officers comm and
you will be able to have a much better
experience out of the blocks with the
latest drivers alright and then we have
the board itself in a Seuss's eco
friendly all paper packaging there's no
phone there's very little plastic
actually so I'm going to go ahead and go
wrong way wrong way it's hard to operate
a camera from like the front of it
not ideal alright so I don't see any
mention whatsoever on this board for
crossfire support to be perfectly honest
but I haven't actually checked to see if
it does support it so hopefully I'll
figure it out at some point to make an
annotation but let's have a look at the
general layout of the board so first of
all you've got two PCI slots one PCI
Express 16 slot and one PCIe one slot
this is kind of my ideal configuration
for a micro ATX board these days because
really if you're going to be using a
single slot GPU even if yeah even if
you're using a single slot GPU you're
going to want to leave the next slot
open so it has some room to breathe so
this way you can use a PCI Express and a
PCI and then you can also use a video
card in it if you want you've got a few
USB 3.0 scuse me you at 3 USB 2.0
headers
alright then you've got six SATA ports
which is I love that I love how so how
so many lower end boards these days are
coming with more SATA ports you can also
see that even though this looks like
kind of a random layout for them it's
not random at all because here's your
PCI Express graphics slot and here is
the space that would be taken up by a
dual slot GPU so they've got it
positioned so you can conveniently make
use of these even if you have a long
graphics card installed you got an IDE
port on the side here and then you have
your 24-pin power located in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge
they've got their wow I can't believe
they didn't call this out on the box
because I've seen it on every other box
that has this they have their easy one
sided Ram instantly I don't know I don't
remember what this is called but
basically there's only a clip on the one
side the other side this side doesn't
actually have clips so you see there
they're shaped kind of different so all
you have to do is you you put the RAM
module in this one and then you open up
the clip put it in and then clip it in
on the one side so it's kind of
different that way alright
then you've got your LGA 1156 socket
which supports core i3 s core i5s and
core i7 now this is an age 55 board so
means you've got onboard video including
HDMI DVI and VGA but the bad news is
that the onboard video is not on the
motherboard it's not actually in the
chipset it's in the CPU so if you put in
a CPU that doesn't have onboard video
then it won't work so you have to use a
core i3 dual core or a Core i5 dual core
in order to take advantage of the
onboard video just something you ought
to be aware of all right so then we've
got an eight pin power connector which
is quite surprising to see on like like
I said sort of a it's kind of a hybrid
like it's either value or its high-end
it's kind of both okay they've got their
cool fortress of solitude style of
MOSFET cooling here I really like this I
can't even I can't even explain why and
then on the back panel let's have a
quick look here I mean I know I kind of
showed it to you but let's have a better
look so you've got a ps2 port looks like
it's keyboard only but it might work
with them else I have no idea normally
those ones are color coded green and
purple then you've got six USB ports
these are all USB 2.0 you've got HDMI
like I said won't work without the
onboard GPU then you've got optical
audio out you've got a couple more GPU
outputs again they don't work without an
onboard GPU you've got Gigabit Ethernet
and 7.1 audio so thank you for checking
out my click on boxing of the asou Speas
