really well there's sort of twins
they're like fraternal twins or paternal
twins I think people's mean the same
thing where their non-identical twins so
these are two similar products from in
wind from their commander two series of
power supplies so this is in line with a
theme that we've seen quite a bit over
the last little while in the tech
industry and that is with boards like
the saber-tooth from a sous with cases
like the shoot okay I can't remember for
the life of me but this military themed
thing that's going on is now has now got
a power supply to match so these are
available in a variety of capacities the
two that we have here today are the 850
watt and the 1200 watt they're modular
cables Japanese industrial grade
capacitors and strict voltage regulation
which is plus or minus five percent
although most high-end power supplies
these days have voltage regulation that
is well well under plus or minus five
percent however I mean I'm sure they're
just saying sort of in in general within
spec 80 plus bronze certification nvidia
sli certification five-year warranty is
included with Bullock of these and let's
go ahead and flip them over they give us
an outline of the cables they give us an
outline of the fans so it has a silent
frozen flow fan interesting dual primary
Japanese fasters DC to DC design the DC
to DC design is actually very
interesting because what that means is
you can provide almost the entire output
wattage of the power supply on the 12
volt rail so this one can do that's um
yeah maximum okay that one's a little
bit less than what I'm normally
accustomed to seeing for a dc-to-dc
design and the 1201 is capable of doing
over 1,000 watts over 9000 from the 12
volt rails they have 4 12 old rails each
maxing out at 40 amps for the 1200 watt
and 34 amps for the 850 watt they
support active power factor correction
okay silent 13 point I think they mean
one hundred and thirty five-millimeter
fanfic
15 centimeter I think is more common in
Europe than it is in North America where
we refer to the mall and military are
millimeters here are your protections
including over voltage / current under
voltage I can't remember what they'll
stand for but they're good you want them
come up here supports nvidia sli and
quad sli and all multi core GPU
technologies that's kind of cool because
let's see how many connectors the 850
watt has high efficiency voltage
transfer design technology double poured
circuit design high-efficiency up to
eighty-five percent yeah it's a new plus
bronze 86 plus 2 pin pcie connectors
that is awesome especially and this is
something honest okay here here a bit of
a tangent here guys well I open this up
this bugs me about about almost every
power supply out there is they have all
this wattage components are getting more
efficient not less efficient every day
whether it's CPUs or graphics cards or
whatever else is all getting more
efficient these days so we see these you
know thousand watt power supply is that
for whatever reason only come with four
pci e connectors why they're capable of
running 3gp use just fine so in mind has
gone ahead and included as many pcie
connectors as you could want even on
there 850 watt model so i applaud them
for that that is a smart move because as
components continue to deliver more
performance per watt and to focus on
that and emphasize it i think we're
going to see lesser power supplies
capable of powering a greater number of
components with ease let's go ahead and
open up this so they both come with
beefy power cords they don't come with
some you know pre-attached cables which
some people mind i personally don't as
long as it's sensible i had one modular
power supply that had to a pin and a
4-pin pre-attached so unless you're
running like it and this is an 850 watt
power supply so that that's
inappropriate on the other end of the
spectrum coming looking at it going who
has an 850 watt consumer-grade power
supply running there like server board
not very many people I mean hey if
you're doing it go ahead leave a comment
on the video let me know I have an 850
watt consumer-grade power supply running
my server
they're bored with dual CPUs and I'll be
later okay cool by the way get a new
power supply um ok moving on here guys
here is which one is this I can't even
keep track they both oh these look cool
actually check this up so the branding
on them is very military great and it
actually reminds me of something that
Nvidia sent me once so this is this is
again the whole military theme all
industry likes this whole like sprayed
on like letters thing so you got your
1200 why your 850 watt you've got all of
your sort of key talking points
supporting pcie modular one 13.5 okay
efficiency SLI and all of that good
stuff say me back showed off my nvidia
military box for the last time here okay
here's the connectors we have with the
1200 watt so we've got our 24 pin 20
plus 4 so if you are really still
running a 20 pin motherboard then good
for you and I guess you can continue to
do that we have an 8-pin pre-attached
and then we have 46 no oh we have an a
pin and a 4 plus 4 pin attached with a
1200 watt power supply I don't mind that
as much because you're far more likely
to have like dual 8 pins on something
like that motherboard for example x79
aud 7 from gigabyte you've also got 26
plus 2 pin pcie connectors pre-attached
again 1200 watt power supply if you're
not running sli or crossfire with two
high-end cards don't have a 1200 watt
power supply because remember guys the
most efficient point for power supply
isn't that sort of forty to sixty
percent load range so if you're running
it like twenty percent load when your
systems like chugging along doing as
much as it can then you're not actually
getting the best efficiency out of it
here we go we have another modular pcie
cable and what's cool about this hey
check this out they've got one more here
and actually another two more here so
yeah so there you go up to eight pcie
six plus two pin connectors are built
into this power supply that means you
can run up to quad it GPUs without any
difficulty very very cool stuff okay
moving along we've got a four molex
another four molex these are actually
using fairly high quality sleeving check
that out guys those are full colored
cables in there but you're having a
pretty hard time seeing through them
these look really nice and then they got
they have
cheaped out on the heat-shrink you see
that from time to time where they use
like little tiny heat shrink things
because about heat drinks expensive i
guess so no those look really good and
then you've also got 24 x SATA
connectors so that's not quite as many
peripherals cable harnesses as i would
have liked to normally see but it's
probably as many as most people will use
not everyone is running eight SSDs and
their machine plus needing an additional
cable to run up to their optical drives
so the 850 watt power supply includes is
exactly the same it's just 851 yeah I
love that love that because who knows
you might need for mid-range GPUs maybe
you're running a folding farm maybe you
just want a power supply that has lots
of PCIe connectors in terms of modular
connections here they are so there's
your two PCIe there's your SATA /
peripheral power and I think that pretty
much wraps it up let's take a closer
look at the units overall aesthetics so
we've got our honeycomb mesh at the back
your on/off switch power plug got your
sweet like cool looking like branding
thingamajig this is the second in the
commander series there was the original
commander now there's commander to like
outranks commander one and like can
order them around and stuff there's that
which you've probably already kind of
scene this is that patented modular
power supply thing that ultra has so
they make you put this like body sticker
on your power supply if you uh if you
properly lease license the technology
and then there is the one hundred thirty
five-millimeter fan on the bottom so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the inn win commander
two series of power supplies and don't
