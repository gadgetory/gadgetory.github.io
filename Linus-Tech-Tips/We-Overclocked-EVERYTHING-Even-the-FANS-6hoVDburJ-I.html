overclock over volt or otherwise run
beyond the manufacturer specifications
every single part of it that we can some
of the stuff we're gonna do will
seriously improve performance and some
of it definitely won't big shout out to
see sonic by the way for sponsoring this
craziness let's get started
so it shouldn't be news to most of you
that the first thing you need when
you're overclocking is a solid power
supply inadequate or unstable power can
adversely affect stability so we chose
the C Sonic prime titanium fanless a
seriously cool unit that is literally
silent because it has no fan so it's the
first thing that we're going to tune by
plugging it into one of the 208 volt
power outlets in the other unit so we're
running on 120 volt right now sucking
about 270 watts let's see what happens
here
alright so after a quick cable swap here
for this beefy extension cord running
out of the other room we're running at
about a hundred and ninety volts so
there was some voltage drop and our same
stress test is now between 255 and 260
watts this doesn't make anything faster
but it does improve your system's
efficiency though probably not enough
that I would if you're in North America
like run out and get 200 volt power put
into your house now before doing
anything else you're gonna want your
mother board's latest bios so you can
see ours is so new that it has little
animations in here you're also going to
want the latest OS updates and a handful
of tuning utilities then you want to get
some baseline readings and your
preferred performance tests so you can
make sure that any efforts you're making
any dials that you're turning are
actually doing something and that what
they're doing is positive now we've done
more detailed CPU overclocking guides in
the past so we're gonna skip over some
details here but basically by adjusting
our CPU multiplier to 51 and disabling s
vid we were able to get our core i5 8600
K from 4.3 gigahertz on all course to
5.1 gigahertz with all cores active at
one point two seven five bulbs so that's
only a point zero zero five volt
increase
and it yields a 20% or higher
improvement in our CPU tests so we are
off to a very good start now this is
usually where we stop tooling around
with the processor because CPU cache
overclocking doesn't really help much
outside of very memory intensive
applications but not today after getting
your CPU core dialed in you can actually
start upping the cache until it's at a
similar frequency to the core or until
it causes stability problems so ours was
able to go from four to four point eight
gigahertz with a little bit more CPU
voltage which actually did manage to
give us a measurable boost in Cinebench
now when it comes to ram overclocking we
generally recommend staying away from
XMP or other auto memory overclocking
since while sometimes it works so it can
be worth a shot
other times it can be questionably
stable as for our kit well it's rated at
3200 megahertz and our overclocking
result was 32 hundred megahertz even
with extra voltage so we didn't
technically overclock our ram but we did
overclock our system past the j dec ddr4
spec so yeah we got an extra 27 points
in Cinebench so we're gonna call that a
success from there we did actually try
fine-tuning the base clock of the system
as well but especially given that we
already had everything else like tuned
to the redline it wasn't having any of
it this whole thing is on the knife's
edge of stability as it is so then with
all the tuning we've done so far what do
we get for our trouble how has this
affected our gaming experience pool
turns out we've netted a whopping 1.2
percent increase in 3dmark times by and
a whole 2 fps
in Far Cry 5 so it might be time to
overclock our graphics my preferred
strategy for this is MSI Afterburner in
the foreground so we can make any
adjustments that we'd like and some kind
of stress test running in windowed mode
in the background so we can monitor
stability so you fire up afterburner
grab that there power knob and work it
all the way to the max in our case it's
like a hundred and twelve percent who
some older GPUs do let you go higher
then you incremental II increase the
core clock until the system becomes
unstable so we landed on a hundred and
fifty megahertz for our core for our
memory clock we ended up with plus 275
so you do that right after your core and
this gave us more than a ten frame per
second increase in rise of the Tomb
Raider although everything else hardly
changed for some reason that's kind of
weird why is that well as it turns out
NVIDIA GPU boost three was already
troubling the card up close to two
gigahertz without our adjustments that's
much higher than the advertised 1683
that's because the cooling capabilities
of this card are able to sustain it so
that means that without overclocking
you're actually getting close to the
maximum performance you'd be able to out
of a modern card like a 1070 which is
great for most people but overclockers
without BIOS modding and like physically
modifying the card to apply more voltage
to the GPU don't get a lot of
performance gains to brag about so up
until now everything has been like a
Nanaimo bar just goodness but there has
been one downside thermals so under full
load
our processor for instance is about 15
degrees Celsius hotter but what could we
overclock to make the computer cooler
what if we were to give more voltage to
the fans
so stashed in here where a hard drive
would normally go is something pretty
special this is a DC to DC converter so
all we do is plug standard molex 12 volt
into this side then alex is going to
adjust this little potentiometer here
before it nice
whoa can you hear that now we've got 17
volts coming out the other side which is
where we have our fans attached so in I
264 what kind of an improvement will we
see bad CPU temps down to 69 degrees a 7
degree improvement and all we had to
give up was sound since this guy went
from like I don't know 20 decibels or so
we're not sure since it was below the
sound floor of our office thanks in part
to the fanless power supply up to 55
decibels which is around a normal
conversation or an air conditioner this
also by the way won't help the lifetime
of your fans our NOC to us actually
might be fine but cheaper ones will
likely end up letting out the magic blue
smoke before long so I think pretty much
everything inside the case is
overclocked now but what about the
things outside it like your mouse and
your keyboard and your monitor can they
be overclocked yes yes they can okay so
for your mouse the polling rate in
Windows is a hundred and twenty five
Hertz meaning that there can be up to
eight milliseconds of lag between moving
your mouse and it registering which can
lead to noticeable delays in fast paced
games in Windows 7 it was possible to
overclock the polling rate on your USB
ports which
be great if your mouse sensor could
handle it but windows 8 and up have
changed the way that USB drivers work
and this is no longer possible
fortunately a lot of gaming mouse
manufacturers have found ways to solve
this problem for you since most of them
default to 500 Hertz and you can use
Mouse rate to check yours for yourself
so click and move your mouse around
bippity Boppity this is gonna max out at
500 there you have it now with that said
we can go higher
this final Mouse right here has a
firmware tool that you can grab we get
one crack at this by the way so and run
to flash it to a 1000 Hertz firmware and
then other Mouse manufacturers like
Corsair and razer have software tools
that work similarly let's just let this
finish up and then we'll see if it
worked
hey success I can't even I can't even
move it fast enough to get all the way
to a thousand ok whatever it's
definitely over five hundred as for
keyboards this is largely dependent on
the manufacturer so this Corsair one can
actually be adjusted with this switch
that's right on the back of it bear in
mind of course that the reason they make
this so easy is that it can't affect
compatibility with your system other
keyboards may not be possible to
overclock at all moving on to the
monitor overclocking this is actually
super easy if you've got an Nvidia card
all you need to do is go in to change
resolution right here then click
customize tick enable resolutions not
exposed by the display and create
yourself a custom resolution accepting
all of the terms and conditions and
warnings that come along with it from
here all you got to do is dial in a new
refresh rate then click test even a
small increase over 60 Hertz like going
to 70 or 75 should make a very
noticeable difference in games if you've
got the GPU horsepower to drive it
now there ended up being a few things
that you can't overclock like your SSD
or your hard drive like if you've got a
7200 rpm disc that's all she's got and
the closest thing would be buying a
faster Drive in the first place like a
WD Velociraptor that spins at 10,000 rpm
but like even that is much slower than
an SSD also we tried pretty hard to get
the webcam overclocked and while it's
technically possible to increase the FPS
while decreasing the resolution our
logitech unit just wouldn't play ball
now I was really on the fence about
including this but Alex insisted that we
include one last thing that you can
overclock and it's probably the slowest
thing about your computer you if you
don't touch type learn to touch type
also learn all of the keyboard shortcuts
that you can and if you're doing the
same operation often enough many modern
keyboards allow you to program it as a
macro key only have to press one button
to execute it and there's a joke here
it's terrible since although you can't
stop AI and machines from taking over
maybe you can use these tips and tricks
to stay useful for a little bit longer
so big things to see sonic for
sponsoring this video it's pretty
freaking cool that they were able to
make a 600 watt power supply with
literally zero noise and that they were
cool with us then putting a super loud
system around it thanks for watching you
guys
if this systems this video sucked know
the system doesn't science system is
cool
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one and our community forum
which you should totally join all we've
got to do you're in you're in you got it
oh you're not in dangit Alex look close
to end okay you got a cut you got to
finesse it okay you just got to get the
pins kind of in there and then you get a
you know what you'll know when I'm in oh
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
