unboxing of the kingston ssdnow v-series
gen 2 64 gig SATA 2 solid-state SSD
Drive you think I was reading that from
somewhere based on how rehearsed it
sounded but it actually wasn't it's just
all of the things that this Drive
happens to be okay so what does kingston
say this Drive happens to me they say it
is fast reliable in silent this is true
of almost every SSD on the market so
there is definitely no false advertising
going on there next on the back they see
eight is two and a half inches which i'm
not going to pull out a ruler i can tell
you right now that's a two and a half
inch drive next they say it is faster
system startup for sure increases
application responsiveness definitely
more durable and less noise yes all of
these things are true but SSDI actually
SSD is a popular topic for me I've done
quite a few videos both on- tech tips as
well as my NCIX comm channel outline the
advantages of an SSD drive because i
think they are many and i think that if
he can afford it an SSD is one of the
best upgrades you can do for your system
right now i would even say if you have a
reasonably modern system it is better
than upgrading a cpu or ram at this
point in time because it makes such a
big difference to the overall
responsiveness of your system now this
is a fairly popular drive right now and
there are a couple reasons why first of
all Kingston's been very aggressive on
their pricing they're making a big push
into the SSD market because obviously it
plays a lot on their strengths as a
company kingston is a memory and flash
manufacturer this is flash memory so it
stands to reason that they would want to
get their foot in the door in this
particular market so inside the box we
find the just get this open if this is a
perforated booklet for some reason can't
figure out why they would bother to do
that but i have to actually break the
seal here to access the inside very
strange okay and then in here there's a
little booklet which tells us it is a
getting started guide and it is in
umpteen billion different language
unfold it here so it's this wide all
right let's have a look at the English
one okay it basically says plug it in
and then configure the bios so that it
recognizes the drive all right well
thank you Kingston as long as you know
how to install a hard drive actually
this is something I should talk about if
you know how to install a hard drive you
know how to install an SSD I've actually
gotten quite a few messages from from
people who are concerned about SSB well
you know how do I know if it's
compatible with my computer how do i
install it compared to a hard drive it's
exactly the same thing it behaves
exactly like a hard drive so there's
nothing there's no sort of mystique
about it if you have a say 22 port then
you can plug an SSD into it alright so
why don't we have a look at the drive
itself and I apologize because I haven't
gone and prepped myself on the read and
write specs of this particular drive and
they don't actually put it anywhere on
their packaging it's a very very strange
thing I had expected them to sort of
outline the specs for me somewhere but
they they haven't so that's okay anyway
so you can see on the front we've got
the capacity here and then under here
we've got the series so this is the SSD
now v-series they don't say anywhere on
here about it being gentoo but i'm going
to go ahead and guess at the s 2 64gb
stands for something like series 2 64
gigabytes on the sides you've got your
standard two and a half inch mounting
holes so this is going to be compatible
with almost all notebooks out there
alright then you've got your other
mounting rules on the bottom so mounting
holes on the sides in the bottom what a
lot of people are doing is they're
putting these okay the two most popular
configurations for an SSD number one
putting it in a laptop because it can
breathe new life into an old laptop you
will not know what what hit you when you
install an SSD into your notebook the
next most popular configuration because
capacities are so small a typical SSD is
between 30 to 120 games so what people
are doing is they're actually installing
an SSD in their computer as a C Drive
putting their OS and key applications on
it maybe a couple games and then they're
using a hard drive for the rest of their
mass storage this is actually what i do
i use a couple SSDs and raid 0 in my
system and then
surely keep any mass storage on my
computer I have all of it stored over
Gigabit Ethernet to a windows home
server anyway enough about me on the
back of the drive we've got state of
power as well as saitta to data and that
pretty much covers my unboxing of the
kingston ssdnow v2 solid-state drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
