be all of WV my man unboxings there
uber premium product none of these
things today we're going to be having a
look at the my net n900 central this is
basically like the my net and 900 except
it comes with a hard drive inside which
means this is basically like an ass that
also functions as a router that also
functions as a network switch that also
functions as a wireless access point
then also functions as an Apple time
capsule it just does everything I mean
you'll still need a computer and like or
like a tablet or something but but it
almost says everything alright
effortless entertainment this refers to
W DS fast-track technology so what fast
track around a fast track plus fast
track uses profiles in the firmware to
provide dynamic quality of service to
all the traffic that's coming in and out
of your network fast track plus
automatically detects what kind of an
application is using this number of
bandwidth and then automatically
reserves it for applications that it
deems to be more important such as Skype
or gaming or whatever else where you
don't want to have that extra latency
while the packets wait for you know
Jeffery's you know my little pony
you know TV show downloads that don't
matter at all because you know I don't
know if it'll actually prioritize like
house over my little pony if two people
are watching TV but it'll prioritize
that TV over like torrenting for example
alright what else we got here auto
backup very cool stuff because of the
internal hard drive that feature is
enabled so while their other routers do
have USB ports for external hard drives
this is a more integrated more elegant
solution for sure more reliability
wirelessly backup personal files on all
your PC's to one reliable location
wherever you are in your network very
cool stuff I'm big into nas unless you
can if you guys don't already know that
I believe in data backups because drives
fail
it's just a reality of it more control
minor dashboard provides a simple view
of your essential settings for easy
customization and more advanced options
such as advanced QoS wireless security
parental controls network diagnostic
tools Auto sensing for technology and
inside amplifier so this is an n900
router built in here so it's pretty much
as fast as it gets on wireless in and it
also has four Gigabit Ethernet ports
which actually isn't quite as many as
the regular Minet and 900 which has
seven Gigabit Ethernet ports but this
one it has a hard drive so you have to
decide which features matter it's
available on a one terabyte or two
terabyte configuration at launch we have
the one terabyte one here because you
know to test it it's not like we needed
higher capacity let's go ahead and open
this bad boy up so we've got a technical
support limited warranty guide a start
here CD people even have optical drives
are there any computers anymore
you think still need this I actually
don't know power cable power brick
ethernet cable you can get brick no
there's nobody net breaking I mean
wanted an Ethernet brick beam may be a
switch don't be s don't be a smart guy
slick kekeke contributed switch at the
same time as me which basically means
now he's gonna think he's as clever as I
am which is he's gonna be y'all putting
on airs and I'm gonna have to like pay
and more and it's gonna be problematic
for everyone actually okay so moving
right along fast track plus is awesome
auto backup is awesome it's both Apple
and Windows compatible which is very
cool backup all the same time stream
surf play yeah good stuff your computers
and stuff going on okay view and share
your files at home or away with the WD
to go remote access it's available as an
app very cool stuff
superior multi floor coverage with range
amplifying technology so this one the my
net n900 central does have the same
wireless range as the n900 the same fast
track plus the same Gigabit Ethernet
ports but not as many of them one fewer
USB 2 port remember it's got an internal
hard drive already anyway though and all
these features including look at this
actually huh they they changed it they
just added this one see it wasn't even
on there see the central it's not there
and then they just put like although
this one needs like more so I guess
they didn't want you to compare the
central when you were looking at my
maybe I the time they launched this
they'll ever advise the packaging but
they're both DLNA certified which means
you can stream your media all over the
place like a boss internal storage auto
backup and remote access all included
because of that hard drive okay I think
that pretty much more is it for the box
it's slightly heavier than the regular -
and 900 which makes sense because hard
drives are heavy on the front we've got
a power switch our power led rather
Wireless led internet LED WPS LED and
hard drive activity LED this is not
present on the n900 we've got a WPS
button for your easy wireless setup
we've got a power switch power in for
Gigabit Ethernet ports one internet LAN
port one USB port and a Kensington lock
the other ones didn't have a Kensington
lock but then they weren't as expensive
cooling fan is in the bottom I really
hope it's quiet
there's your reset switch in the bottom
as well there's your part number serial
number and knock address and there's
your sort of performanc looking matte
top things going on here and I think
that pretty much covers it so that is it
we are finally finished with the mine at
n900 central the entire range of Western
Digital routers and well of a gun box
them anyway we're gonna do more videos
about them that actually show off these
cool fast-track features but thank you
for watching
