review of this cooler originally I was
just going to use it to upgrade the
stock cooler that I installed in II
Diesel's upgraded workstation back
around the time I originally built it
almost a year ago since our whole room
water cooling project is a thing now
though edie won't need an air cooler in
his work station anymore
so when Luke asked to borrow this for
our MSI Nightblade review I was like
sure take it and then apparently you
guys liked it so much that you wanted to
see a standalone review so here we are
with the purchase of a qualifying Intel
processor SSD or nook you could
instantly win and Intel gaming Jersey
and be entered in the draw for the
ultimate system click now to learn more
let's start with a physical tour of the
unit you get the usual awesome naktu
accessories thermal compound splitter
cable to fans to low noise adapters I'm
in the ITX mounting kit a case badge and
their standard set Q firm mounting
hardware more on that later
then you get the heatsink itself which
actually comes with both the NFF 12 PWM
120 millimeter fan and the NFB 992
millimeter fan pre mounted to it now the
challenge with this little baby was
keeping it narrow enough to avoid
potential interference with nearby
memory slots or vrm solutions on tiny
MITx motherboards while keeping height
low enough for half height or unusual
size computer cases and then achieving
both of those things with adequate
cooling for you know high-performance
quad core processors so not to a wet
with an aluminum fin or a soldered to
four copper heat pipes then soldered
those again on the other side to there
as always beautiful and shiny base plate
they then put a clean-looking nickel
coating finish over the whole thing and
I mean that's tidy it looks nice and all
that but it's not exactly groundbreaking
no the really cool stuff with this
cooler happens when we start looking at
fan mounting options you probably
noticed I said it comes with both 120
millimeter and 92 millimeter fans that
are pre mounted now you can leave them
both on there giving the cooler a 92
millimeter total profile or
you can actually remove that top fan for
reduced performance but a mere 66
millimeter profile which gives you some
great flexibility in terms of mounting
options
speaking of mounting options I guess
it's time to hand off to Luke to give
you guys the performance skinny get it
to dope because it's slim cooler ah
anyway
sorry the performance and mounting
rundown on the NHL 12 in both our
standard test bench and and the size
Nightblade small form-factor bare-bones
PC where we originally showed it to you
installation of the NHL 12 was
incredibly easy and I was kind of
surprised you don't actually have to
worry about that bottom fan you just
leave it installed because all you have
to do is feed your screwdriver through
the little hole on the heat fins on the
top and it goes in between the fins of
the fan down below and lets you skir in
a pretty elegant solution and they
definitely thought about this while they
were designing it okay so fairly
obviously it gets crushed in the c70
because it's going up against some
pretty big dogs some dual rad coolers
and really big towers when we put it in
the night blade against the intel cooler
it crushes there as well and something
to notice here is the zero on the intel
cooler under load isn't because the
intel cooler is magic given to us by
some crazy demon it's because it totally
failed and hit t.j.maxx under load and i
had to stop it before bad things started
happening or it throttled itself to help
so and that could that processor was not
even overclocked the only overclocked
one was on the c 70 where we were doing
our standard tests at one point three
volts 4.0 gigahertz with small FFTs
running on prime95 and combustor so i
don't know
pretty good job for a small cooler and a
really good alternative in a small case
to a stock intel cooler but if you have
a full sized cooler maybe not but you
probably knew that already speaking of
fans I am a fan of the way team provides
their customers with affordable and
reliable wireless coverage they claim
that their pay only for what you use
model will save 90% of people money on
their monthly cell phone bill but you
don't have to take their word for it if
you head over to - dog team comm you can
find their savings calculator well if
you enter your information from the last
three Wireless bills you've had they'll
let you know what you could have
if you were on ting an amazing customer
service since they actually employ
humans like human beings rather than
robots which kind of sucks and they let
everyone know that their service runs on
the Sprint network so if you check out
how Sprint coverage is in your area
you'll know what kind of service you'll
have and how reliable it'll be with ting
and the last and best part is that if
you use the link in the description down
below when you sign up that's - talk
tank on you'll get $25 off an awesome
new device or $25 off service credit
that's a decent payout and thanks for
watching this video so check out ting
comm and check the link in the video
description for a discount I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
