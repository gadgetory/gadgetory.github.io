is all about building and using a
six-foot-tall evaporative cooler to cool
down a core i7 extreme edition processor
this is coke really known as bong
cooling so sit back relax get real
relaxed and enjoy

description so some of you are probably
asking yourselves is he serious right
now and the answer is yes let's begin
then with some theory traditional PC
coolers like heat sinks and closed-loop
water cooling systems and even fully
custom water coolers can deliver
fantastic results for overclockers and
silence enthusiasts but sadly videos
like this showing minus 10 to minus 20
degrees CPU temperatures with a bunch of
fans on a radiator will always be
shockingly effectively however epic
trolls through the miracle of video
editing TPL who legitimately has plenty
of gear capable of reaching those temps
swapped in some screen cap of a
different cooling system and we know
this because
three cheers for science and the laws of
thermodynamics heat just like water or
nutrients across the membrane of a cell
naturally flows from an area of higher
temperature one with a higher average
kinetic energy of its molecules and
atoms to one of lower temperature so as
air let's say it's 22 degrees Celsius
passes over a heat sink that's sitting
at around 50 degrees Celsius due to its
absorption of thermal energy from a CPU
underneath that thermal energy naturally
transfers from the hot heat sink to the
cooler surrounding air where it can be
blown out a window or whatever and the
wider the difference in temperature
between the heat sink and the air the
faster this transfer takes place which
is why you'll reach a maximum low
temperature while running a game for
fifteen to thirty minutes instead of it
just continuing to rise cool right
sure it is but all cooling systems that
rely on these principles inherently
share a hard performance limit that is
to say that no matter how many heat
pipes radiators or cooling fans you add
you can never get below the temperature
of the
air around you well hold on a second
Linus what about windchill when I put my
arm out the window of my car it feels a
whole hell of a lot cooler cruising down
the highway than sitting at a red light
even when it's really hot outside well
that is because you are made of water
the effect that you're feeling is called
evaporative cooling and it works thanks
to a neat little concept called stick
with me here we're almost done the
enthalpy of vaporization in simple terms
for a given mass of fluid to change
phases for example from liquid to gas
energy must be either absorbed or
released ice can be colder than zero
degrees funfact and water vapor can be
hot enough to burn you or hot enough to
freaking cook you but not while it is in
the midst of a phase change that's why
the mixture of ice and water in your
glass stays at exactly zero degrees
Celsius until all of the ice is melted
and that's why your boiling pot of water
on the stove stays at exactly 100
degrees until all the water evaporates
and then you need to buy a new piece of
cookware the heat energy being added by
the Sun or the cooking element is being
used to break hydrogen bonds between h2o
molecules before the new phase can
continue to heat up so as long as you
keep adding ice or water to that
two-phase mixture the temperature
remains constant okay then so bond
cooling you don't have to put water on a
stove for it to evaporate otherwise I
mean how would the glass of water you
spill on the carpet ever dry more heat
just speeds up this process and if
you've ever tried to clean up a spill
before mom notices it you probably also
know that more air flow may be in the
form of a fan makes this happen faster
too so in a nutshell a bond cooler works
by first creating small droplets of
water with a showerhead
this gives the falling water more
surface area making it easier to
evaporate then dropping these water
droplets down a cooling
our which causes the water molecules on
the surface of the droplets to change
phase to gas absorbing heat energy from
the liquid water that remains in the
falling droplet effectively cooling it
we use fans then to blow air from the
bottom of the cooling tower to the top
to accelerate this process this allows
us to potentially reach sub ambient
temperatures assuming enough airflow big
enough towers and favourable humidity
and atmospheric pressure conditions this
is at the cost however of losing to the
room around us some of that liquid water
so let's build it then shall we darris
will be assisting me since i'll be in
another country by the time this is
being filmed here's what you'll need we
took a lot of cues from this awesome
build blog over on overclock net four
inch diameter PVC piping PVC joiners to
120 millimeter fans with a power adapter
for them as many shower heads as you
will have cooling towers some wood a PVC
why one per tower
a powerful pump to get water to the top
of the showerheads 1/2 inch clear
flexible tubing some miscellaneous 5/8
inch PVC fittings to join our tubing
runs together and a normal CPU water
block which leads us then to a moment of
truth time and here are the results
the advantage of Vaughn cooling here is
that we were able to beat the
performance of a traditional ambient CPU
cooler without adding a significant
electrical cost thermoelectric or
Peltier cooling air conditioning or
phase change would incur these penalties
and the higher your airflow our fans are
actually kind of wimpy and the lower the
humidity in your environment desert
dwellers rejoice the more effective this
would be but there are some
disadvantages as well it's kind of loud
if you're not into the whole falling
water relaxation thing it increases the
humidity of the room it occupies its
large if you want it to work well and
finally unless you were to rig up some
kind of water level meter and an
automated top-up mechanism connected to
your house plumbing which is possible
mind you you'll need to constantly top
it up with water which is why most
people don't build them but hey that's
never stopped us before has it speaking
of not being able to stop us you can't
stop us from talking about crunchyroll
