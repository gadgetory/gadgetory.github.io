by the D brand grip super grippy case
and D brand's prism screen protectors
we're here in the asus rog components
suite which also clearly is not fully
set up yet but we found some really cool
stuff in here so they've got this demo
system that's not running yet oh that's
heavy I'm not gonna mess with that too
much but it's clearly water-cooled it's
clearly got a motherboard that we have
never seen in person before let's just
open it up look at that so this is their
Dominus Xtreme I'll show you that in a
little bit more detail later and they've
got the first ever water-cooled video
card that doesn't have like an external
radiator with tubing to it that you got
to like put over here anyway
that's that system is not actually
running yet but that doesn't matter
because I've got the key components over
here so this I was actually thinking of
doing a dedicated video called Intel
your desperation is showing or something
like that this is gonna run their
upcoming 28 core overclockable CPU but
the reason we didn't end up doing a
dedicated video even though this thing
is nuts look at this for eight pin CPU
power connectors three PCI Express power
connectors and two 24 pin connectors
look the entire top of the board is just
vrm this entire thing is just power
delivery the reason we didn't end up
doing it video is because we don't
really know anything about it 6 channel
memory yeah just like the Xeon
Platinum's
four PCI Express slots we don't know
pricing of the board we don't know
pricing of the CPU we don't know what
realistic overclocking results are Intel
showed 5 gigahertz but that was on like
very very chilled liquid so it just is
kind of like it's like a showpiece right
now it's all it really is but now I'm
not going to help Asus with too much of
their booth set up here but I did find
this power brick that is trailing out
the back of this thing that wasn't
plugged in that seems to fire up the
fans on the card and there's a USB cable
back here
I'm gonna go ahead and plug into my hey
my portable power battery bank Hey look
at that see I'm helping I am helping I
mean I'm not gonna leave my battery bank
here but that's not the point also I'm
gonna unplug this because guess what I
got I got no kids so we're gonna have a
look at what exactly a water-cooled
graphics card like this is oh man
hopefully this even like can be pulled
off because I've sort of committed to it
now not a lot fine guys chill not gonna
break it to you look if they didn't want
a bull running around in their china
shop they shouldn't have had him on the
guest list okay so the crazy thing about
this is that from the front from the
bottom from the back from the side
everything about it looks fairly normal
to the uninitiated and you know even to
the fairly initiated I would say so I
think this shiny piece here has to come
off yeah okay I thought there might be a
screw under there I no longer believe
that there's a screw under there anyway
one hint as to what we're about to see
though is this so that is like more of a
like a water block style cold plate down
there and then it appears as though
they're using the same kind of pump and
water block combo unit that we've seen
in aio coolers and then if we look
closely instead of just heat pipes
running to aluminum fins we've got a
radiator here it's just bolted to the
front of the card now I want to get a
better look at it I'm having a really
hard time figuring out where the
additional screws are
you know what I'm doubling down I'm
doubling down on my the screws are under
here theory more than one of these here
right yep I don't know if they have
another one to put back on their little
demo stand though I mean this adhesive
seemed to go back on pretty well I just
want to see the radiator okay so there
were three screws on the bottom we got
those up you haven't taken it apart so
so you're okay
so it seems now I'm good okay so it
seems like there's something holding it
over here something along here I just
want to be able to show the radiator and
the block like kind of show how it goes
together this adhesive I've had it up
and down once already it seems to be
holding together pretty well in case
you're curious you know what I think I
might know what's going on here I think
I might not have the right screwdriver
for this there's three screws that are
just barely accessible if you get back
here yeah and this is all I have and I
can't get to them yeah I even thought
about grabbing my like more traditional
jeweler screwdrivers but they look so
much like a weapon I didn't want to put
them in my luggage I am going through
the really annoyed yeah so I can put
this plate back on
that sucks
whoa hold on it's okay no no I was just
putting the card back together I had
given up I found the screws so there
they're back there but I left my my like
traditional jeweler's screwdrivers at
home but then this was sitting down here
and it was like that kind of looks like
a toolkit but why does it have this on
it apparently to make sure that no one
will open it okay so let's try this this
is gonna be really really hard to put
back together I legitimately don't know
if I'm going to be able to put these
screws back in and but they're already
out now so since the ship has sailed
you might as well just proceed like if
you're already going to hell you know
why stop I think I got it there we go
those three screws released this nice
okay where's my screwdriver get off
there off she goes there it is
so that is how they're doing it and I'm
glad that I got this popped off because
there's already at least one thing that
I got wrong here so I was telling you
guys that it looked like they had used a
pump CPU block combo here but what
they've actually done is they've used
this extremely compact pump right here
so this allows a soos to avoid any
issues with the ASA Tech patent that
prevents third parties from using
unlicensed block pump combo units and it
still managed
is to be small enough to install
directly on top of a graphics card now
in terms of the cooling capacity here
crazily enough they actually haven't
compromised much there so as far as I
can tell this plate right here is just a
protective piece so naturally we'll be
removing it no it looks like I'm not
gonna be able to get that off that
easily so this is a protective piece for
the tubing
there's no reservoir so just like a
typical closed-loop cooler
it's just prefilled at the factory and
then it maybe you can help me with this
so we've got the inlet on the pump then
we've got the outlet right here going to
the GPU block no power comes off the
board right here this is a super small
pump by the way then so we've got our
cold plate down there which presumably
is covering both the GPU and the HBM
memory modules is that correct I mean I
can't imagine that they didn't do that I
don't see anything else down here yeah
it's hard to it's hard to go any further
than this unfortunately you guys we've
got DRM over here which is handled just
with downdraft cooling from the fans up
here and then this is weird
see this here so unlike a normal
radiator there's kind of a the end tank
is in the middle and I don't know how
the flow path works but out from the GPU
block comes in the underside right here
on a normal radiator it goes in the one
side on the end tank down then you have
a smaller end tank on the other end it
goes over and then through these thin
tubes right here but it's coming right
up here and then it's coming out here so
I can only imagine that they've done
some kind of routing you know what I
think I know what they did I think this
is how it works so it goes in the bottom
here and then there's a divider here it
goes it fills this tank
goes over here through the skinny end
tank and then out here then it's a
parallel flow path I think it goes in
here down this side of this one through
this skinny end tank and then up here
and then the cooled water comes together
back through the pump over to the GPU
again now I don't have verification of
this but I can't imagine that it would
work any other way because it couldn't
just go straight from here to here you
wouldn't get any cooling out of it
that is something I did not expect to
see here so while I put this back
together let's talk about what kind of
performance you could expect from a 2080
ti that is water-cooled well a lot but
maybe not quite as much as you'd hope
because of the way that NVIDIA has
restricted their partners abilities to
over volt their GPUs you're probably
only looking at a couple percent faster
than a well air-cooled 2080 ti now with
that said what a sues claims is that
like other liquid cooled graphics cards
which have existed in the past but with
a separate radiator this one will run
much cooler and that'll mean that the
card will be able to maintain its
maximum power state more consistently
and more stable E and another thing to
consider is that while many bench
markers run their tests in a room
temperature room your room might not be
that temperature so if you're from
somewhere that's particularly hot or you
don't have air conditioning or whatever
the case may be then something like this
might be necessary in order to get the
maximum performance out of your card
this was stressful and there we go the
card is reassembled all that remains is
to oh wow the box that was being used as
a stand for this one's pretty beat up
hopefully to have another plan for that
all that remains is to see if their demo
still works yeah
do the phones still spin hey and we're
done so thanks to my sous for being
really good sports about all of this
and thanks to you guys for watching and
thanks to D Bren for sponsoring us here
at CES 2019 there dbrand grip cases
which I will be doing plenty of drop
tests with our super grippy their impact
resistant and they're built with the
same precision you'd expect from D brand
with nice accurate cutouts for your
camera your touch sensor anything else
you might have like say for example a
headphone jack or stylus did I just
break my stylus the stylus popped out is
Oh nope nevermind still good haha that's
good and they've got super clicky
buttons but the really new thing is
their prism screen protectors when they
told me the demo I'd be doing with this
thing I thought they were freaking nuts
not only did they have me hammer a nail
into a piece of wood using the screen of
a phone only to have it not damaged they
had me hit the front of the screen with
the hammer to demonstrate just how
impact resistant it is and it comes with
this really cool little piece that goes
into the bottom of your phone and helps
you align it perfectly every time so
check out the D brand grip and D brand
prism in the linked below to cover your
phone 360 degrees for damage protection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
