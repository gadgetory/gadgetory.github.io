GTX 580 so I'll be running the GTX 580
against the GTX 480 as well as two GTX
460 s
in sli so I'll be running both single
and dual configurations in SLI with the
580 and finding out how the stereoscopic
3d element of rendering the game impacts
the performance so the settings I'm
going to be using are here and I'll be
wearing these slick glasses this is but
some things I'll be using for graphics
are here and that is what they are stay
tuned for morning all right so I want to
talk about the methodology a little bit
with the testing on all of these
different cards with call of duty black
ops in 3d vision surround so the first
thing you're going to notice right away
is that vsync seems to be enabled now I
believe it's to do a 3d vision although
I could be mistaken but despite
disabling vsync and both on the driver
level and in the game it looks like
we're still capped at 60 frames per
second now my suspicion is that that's
to give you a better overall more smooth
3d vision experience because if your
framerate is kind of going all over the
place
then it might it might screw up the
alternate frame vision that you have
with each of your eyes so ok Mason over
there we go okay so basically what we're
not going to be able to look at is
minimum or is maximum frame rate because
the maximum frame rate is going to be 64
all of the cards so we'll have to
completely ignore that but I believe
that the average frame rates should
still be somewhat relevant because
you'll see you're not seeing much of it
here but in the action sequence that I
actually benchmark I use the same
benchmark that I did for my non 3d test
in the action scenes that I actually was
using for benchmarking it actually goes
quite a bit below 60 very frequently
that's disgusting
anyway that's all I wanted to say about
the methodology
so in conclusion really any one of these
configurations is perfectly acceptable
for playing call of duty black ops in 3d
on a single 1920 by 1080 monitor now one
thing that we did notice is that running
of any of the single card configurations
showed a much lower dip in minimum
frames per second versus SLI now because
we were capped at 60 frames per second
we weren't actually able to see the
cards separate themselves out away from
each other in terms of average FPS as
much as you'd normally see if you can
find a way to turn the vsync
off so yeah since there's nothing we can
do about it
it makes all the cards look kind of
close together but what you really want
to look at is that minimum frames per
second because that's where you're gonna
separate the men from the boys so to
speak so thank you for checking out our
little coverage of the 3d vision
experience and call of duty black ops
and so maybe I'll just get back to the
game now don't forget to subscribe to -
