so for this heavyweight battle I have
the GTX 590 as well as the Radeon HD
6990 and then whatever else I get around
to benchmarking before the end of the
day you can see my video card boxes
right there
so I'll figure out what makes sense but
I'm going to do some Crysis 2 benchmarks
since this is my first time benching
Crysis 2 I just want to show you guys
what methodology I'll be using to test
it so first of all you can see in the
options I have configured it at 1080p
with no vsync so that I can get a more
accurate reading you can see the
framerate can clearly go over a thousand
and the menu and I'm using the extreme
system spec and then that's pretty much
it there's honestly it just reeks of
console port it just does I mean you
turn it on it asks you to adjust your TV
and then you go in there there's no real
anti-aliasing options or anything like
that the reason that I am using the
options that are in here rather than
customizing things in the control panel
is that I want you guys to be able to
replicate the results easily at home so
there we go I am going to go ahead and
resume my game it also does not have
save games or loading games or load
games so I have to just play through a
particular checkpoint and then make sure
that I die before I get to the next
checkpoint which is epic fail so
basically I'm going to point myself this
way I'm going to press my benchmark
Start button and I will be playing for
two minutes I have a little route that
I'm going to follow and I'll be focused
mostly on following my path and less on
killing specific guys so I go to that
one side make sure he's dead and then
I'm going to head towards the camp that
I have to infiltrate I'm going to be
using a walking speed so that my run
throughs will be fairly consistent and
this guy can die now I am playing on
easy mode sorry guys it just really is a
lot easier to benchmark on easy than it
is to benchmark on like hard mode
because this guy's he won't turnaround
on using I can kill him instead of
trying to deal with whatever he's going
to be throwing at me
if I don't kill them ahead of time so
I'm going to go up these stairs here did
you do should be a guy here let's see
there is hello now you're dead and now
you're dead here we go and head down
this way
and back towards the entrance where
he'll die and this is like I said it's
about a two minute run through you'll
die and the most important thing is just
lots of scenery I'm going to blow up
some barrels later on just to see how
low the framerate dips and following the
same consistent run through is what I am
aiming for here so you guys can die yay
spray-and-pray
you can die and then I'm going to be
headed over here to blow up these
barrels and they'll stop shooting me
mmm very nice and then I'm going to wait
here for fraps to stop recording and
just do some sniping from here so this
should give me fairly consistent results
based on what I've seen so far I have
one fraps stops recording it'll show the
framerate counter up in the top right
again there we go so fraps has stopped
recording so here I'll share with you
guys in the intro my results with Crysis
2 running at 1080p in the extreme preset
with the GTX 590 so then all I do is go
into my fraps folder go into my
benchmarks folder and bring up this
little file so that is what I use to
compile my results I'm going to run some
other video cards through this game and
find out how they stack up in this
latest and greatest crisis to title bear
in mind guys it's not DirectX 11 yet
because there's no patch for it at the
moment so what I'll probably do is
retest once we have DirectX 11 as well
so um I will not be releasing a crisis
to GPU guide video today because there
are some issues with the game so number
one with my Radeon 6990 and just for
giggles I tried a different one to see
if that would fix the problem it did not
by 6990 I get this awesome awesome
flickering issue outstanding so there's
a 13-page thread on some crisis form or
other where people are anyone running
multi-gpu is complaining about
flickering performance issues some
people are getting the bloom effects
flickering others are getting shadows
flickering I'm getting a whole screen
flickering so I have no idea what that
means in terms of this performance
number and how close that is to how
it'll actually run but like look at this
isn't this outstanding I could get a
headache playing like this in like a
minute I mean the game runs I suppose
but yeah it's a pretty apparent that
nobody at Year Crytek thought it
necessary to ever test the game with a
multi GPU set up based on how many
people are having issues so my
performance review will have to wait and
see on the Nvidia side guess what this
this is actually kind of funny because
where did my GTX 590 go oh here it is
the GTX 590 actually runs Crysis 2 just
fine I get 90 1.7 FPS compared to 62 FPS
at the same settings with the GTX 580 so
that's probably about right considering
how much lower its clocked and sort of
decent but not great scaling but get
this my GTX 580 sli set up actually
scores only about 57 frames per second
with my same playthrough so that means
that while it doesn't flicker like the
6990 does my performance actually goes
down in sli with my particular sli setup
some people running sli are complaining
about flickering and other random issues
too but that doesn't seem to be the
problem I'm having with my system I've
tried wiping drivers there's a fix out
there it involves renaming the exe which
because I'm using a steam copy I cannot
do so guys basically this is just a
teaser video but I will be doing a
performance review of Crysis 2 as soon
as I'm able to run all of my cards with
it and I will be including as many GPUs
as I possibly can to give you guys the
most comprehensive results don't forget
