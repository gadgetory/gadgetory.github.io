amazing how you do live streams like
once a month once every two months and
then as soon as YouTube comes and
they're like you guys broke our
Community Guidelines you're getting a
strike no more live streaming fum√© like
but now but all I want to do is live a
dream I just they just wanna live a
dream so much so they're this place is a
crazy hub of activity there's all kinds
of crazy stuff going on today alone in
our office we either already had do have
or will have let's see Wendell from
level one techs he's coming in later to
co-host the LAN show with Luke Jays two
cents and mrs. Jays two cents so he was
just hanging out and showing her our
studio they're like just kind of chillin
with the crew they're gonna be at our
LTX expo tomorrow louis Rossman was here
I'm not gonna spoil anything but it
involves the iMac Pro that videos come
in and I'm missing anyone I feel like I
could even be I could even be missing
someone I would feel really terrible
Steve from gamers Nexus is gonna be at
LTX tomorrow but he didn't drop by the
office today so it's been nuts and of
course the instant I try and show off
how how busy everyone is getting ready
for things everyone like bails on their
stations and is like you know what that
is actually enough putting these little
pieces of paper into these little
sleeves for the Pecan tomorrow I am
gonna take lunch so these are the the
lanyards that were designed by our new
graphic designer merchandise a these are
probably gonna be like mirrored so you
guys won't be able to read them or
whatever but they say LTX 18 they got a
bunch of like cool graphics and stuff on
there oh yeah so we got people asking
like what happened we got our streaming
cut off because we got a Community
Guidelines strike for those videos that
we upload on Fridays announcing that the
when show is live so we won't be doing
those anymore we promised YouTube that
we will be good good little youtubers
and
we will not be making those videos
anymore because it is technically
against YouTube's guidelines to make a
video for the purpose of driving people
off platform which we are streaming on
Twitch typically and so that was that's
a fake plan
fake plant fake news plans I had someone
say that was a nice plan but it's not a
real plan Oh what else we got going on
in here
well most of the writing again is empty
like Anthony's here because he was
involved in the Rossman shoot but most
of these guys are at the Richmond
Olympic Oval setting up some of the cool
like booths and all kinds of neat stuff
that we're gonna have going on I think
there's like oh look at that look at
that would you look at that it's a while
just look at it just look at it you've
got a wild js2 sans got a wild Luke got
a wild this is two cents I won't
interrupt go ahead tell that's and
that's that's that's all that's all so
cheap she's here out of the goodness of
his heart to come and just be part of
the show so it's gonna be fantastic
all right let's keep going here
are we just typing for attention surely
no one's reading them yes I am I do read
the comments oh we had to shoot tech
links today cuz it's Friday
lucky Friday the 13th that's a good day
you know right before you launch a big
convention where everything's supposed
to be working right then everyone is
like actually moving too fast to get
things cleaned up like literally ten
minutes ago this desk well I was waiting
for the iPhone 10 to charge this desk
had the 120 Hertz 4k monitor that costs
five to six hundred dollars less than
the offerings from a soos and Acer all
right now
this place is uh also almost empty well
this this sucks what what even am I
supposed to show you oh no this is cool
this is one of the things we're gonna be
showing off at LTX so we're calling it
12 k gaming 10 K gaming whatever however
many K's it is we're gonna have 9
34-inch
ultra wide monitors hooked up to the
same rig that we had on 16 K gaming last
year gonna be freaking amazing because
it's actually playable like overwatch is
a pretty good experience I oh wow
Barnet please is also planning to be at
LTX tomorrow so I thought I would have
felt really bad for missing that so it's
gonna be freaking awesome I'm of course
gonna be there my whole team's gonna be
there if you guys are in the Vancouver
area or you can get to the Vancouver
area really quickly we still have
tickets available LTX
Expo com we know it's redundant hey I
don't know what are you guys doing that
Wow look at that
hey everyone so that's what happens when
you have a light right in your face and
the the phone exposes for Wow well
that's better I guess I will go alright
I feel like I feel like I have like some
other kind of update that I should give
you guys but I can't come up with
anything on the spot right confess that
the main reason I'm doing this stream
today is basically just because I wanted
to make sure that our streaming was
actually working because I want to do a
stream from LTX tomorrow at this moment
MFI back did that work okay so that's
pretty funny maybe someone from
YouTube's watching with and they have a
pretty pretty funny funny sense of humor
I think well let's just let's turn it
off in the middle of the stream yeah I'm
back yeah I don't know maybe that was
just like a dead spot yeah Reilly's
working on tackling today it's probably
your fault or at least the thumbnail we
don't work you nearly as hard as your
old employer at the end of it he was
writing hosting and editing tech link
you know we bring him in he's only part
time finishes pastry comes in he writes
the episode he does a thumbnail or two
you know actually oh no businesses are
you editing it today oh no tell us that
oh wow is that your desktop background
or is that this tag you YouTube's going
down 2018
hashtag youtubers suck and we will see
you either a DX or I don't know next
time we used to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
