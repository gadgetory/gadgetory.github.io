going to be investigating radiator fan
configuration we're using a Corsair H
100 GTX it's not a graphics card don't
whine as GTX in it but anyways and some
Noctua n FF 12s in a bunch of different
configurations so check out the
strawpoll link down below vote on which
configuration you think is going to win
and let's do this
Corsair claims unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its new void

in the video description to learn more
our first test we're going to have our
nff 12s pushing air up through the
radiator just two fans nothing super
crazy with push-pull configurations or
whatever
super simple tests also an AI suite in
the motherboard we have them pinned at
60% with all of these tests people go
like I will maybe the fan speed was
changing which is why the thermal paste
application didn't change no the fan
speed is static in all these tests it's
not changing if it changes it might
change by like 10 rpm which just doesn't
at all matter
so to i-264 we go let's test out our
first configuration so with the two
Noctua n FF twelves pushing up through
the radiator at an ambient room
temperature of eighteen point one
degrees the core ran at 38 degrees this
is all done in Celsius we've got our
good kind of starting number let's move
on forward so now the fans are
configured to pull air down through the
radiator and into the case so currently
the airflow is sucking in that way so
running i-264
again start test we'll see you in 10
minutes okay so with the naktu is
pulling down through the rad we had a
room ambient temperature of eighteen
point three and yet again a core
temperature of 38 so that really didn't
make any difference having them push up
or pull down so moving on we're going to
start doing two sets of fans so this
would increase your costs by a fair
amount because a lot of coolers
including this one will come with two
fans but not four so if you want to move
up to four your costs are going to go up
a whole bunch so for this to be worth it
we need the cooling to have a
significant improvement just something
to keep in mind alright so now I have
two sets of fans both pulling down into
the case so one set pushing down through
the radiator another set pulling down
through the radiator we're going to
check in ten minutes
and there we go see you later that
equalled an ambient temperature of
eighteen point five degrees at an actual
readout from the computer temperature
for the core of 35 degrees we saw an
improvement of three degrees but you did
add two nff twelve fins which is like a
fair amount of cost so just keep that in
mind next up we're going to do a pretty
stupid configuration we're going to have
the fans on top trying to pull up
through the radiator and we're gonna
have the fans on the bottom trying to
push down through the radiator so
opposite directions super-weird just
gonna see what what it does I guess
workshop yeah okay so short answer don't
do that long answer the ambient to the
room was eighteen point seven degrees
and the temperature of the core was 48
degrees so not great it increased by
like ten degrees Celsius which is bad so
ya don't have it so that the air is
being pushed at like itself because
that's just a terrible idea and makes no
sense next up what we're going to do is
have it all the air going up with two
layers of fans we're going to have the
bottom fans pushing air up through the
rad and the top fans pushing pulling air
up through the rat so let's try that one
so fairly unsurprisingly with an ambient
of eighteen point seven degrees and a
core temperature of 35 degrees it's
exactly the same as having the fans
point the other direction so right now
we have the fans pulling up through the
red for the ones that are on the top and
we have the pants pushing up through the
rad for the ones that are on the bottom
now we're going to try Ingle layer again
but on the top which includes one of my
favorite configurations but we'll do
that one last so if the fans on top
pushing down through the red we got a
temperature through the computer of 39
degrees and an ambient of eighteen point
eight which is about one degree higher
than when we started with the fans on
the bottom in the same type of
configuration but also about one degree
higher ambient so more or less the exact
same result okay and as I expected last
and definitely not least pulling up
through the rad this is my favorite
configuration and our fav
our configuration here at Linus tech
tips because of the dust management
properties where it will put the dust on
the bottom of the radiator where it's
very easy to take away instead of
sandwich in it somewhere and making it
very annoying cuz I have to go through
the fans and all that crap
it at an ambient of 18.9 which I would
like to point out is almost one full
degree higher than when we started
reached about 39 degrees on the core
which is exactly one degree higher than
the ones we were running when it started
so it performs just as well as having
the fans below the rad and is better for
dust management a win in my opinion so
as it seems to be with the workshop the
conclusion is it doesn't really matter
that much in terms of actual cooling
unless you do something stupid like make
them face each other and conflicting
airflow paths and all that kind of stuff
adding another set of fans can improve
your cooling but not by a huge amount
and probably not by an amount in my
opinion that I would bother getting to
more fans for your rad and adding that
much thickness into the top of your case
and having to deal with them at all that
kind of crap and last but not least I
would like to reaffirm that in my
opinion the best way to put the fans is
pulling up through the rad with the fans
on the top so that the dust will get
caked on to the very bottom of the rad
instead of having it go in some other
direction where the dust is going to get
on to the fans themselves and onto the
rad under where the fans are which is an
extremely annoying place to clean it off
