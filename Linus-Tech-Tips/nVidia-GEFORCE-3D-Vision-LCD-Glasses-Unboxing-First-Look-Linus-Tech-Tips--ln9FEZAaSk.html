this is a silent video today with a
voiceover where we're unboxing the
NVIDIA GeForce 3d vision 3d glasses and
here's me struggling with the knife to
open it actually we experienced some
technical difficulties today because our
our microphone normally I have like that
that mic I wear on my shirt but we had
the receiver for it on the camera but we
I wasn't actually wearing it so the
camera microphone turns off when I when
I don't have that so here's me
struggling to open the box um we're
about to demonstrate I think that I'm
actually standing in a swamp land of
sorts outside of our office we didn't
have the lights today so we we thought
we'd just film it outside with the
natural light very natural experience
overall so there's the carrying pouch
for the glasses and then next you'll
find the Quick Start Guide this is
actually a whole package will show we'll
show the contents of the package after
and this is the cameraman oh oh he's
demonstrate because my voice was going
to be blocked out by the plane flying
overhead but then the plane well we
didn't have any sound so okay the
glasses themselves and a handy cool
little opening box so there's the the
infrared wow what is that
that's the transmitter the infrared
transmitter that hooks up to your
computer I'm figuring out really I have
no idea what I'm doing here like I've
never seen any of this stuff before when
I'm opening up the box so I'm about to
put on the glasses for the very first
time and you can see they're incredibly
stylish I'm showing the USB plug on the
bottom I think I actually show that
again later because we did this all and
I think two takes so yeah there we go
those are those are something else
look at that I've actually been wearing
these around the office for about the
last half hour so I'm getting lots of
compliments okay so there's a Quick
Start Guide it just shows you the
compatible video cards the minimum
system requirements shows you how to
change out the nosepiece so that you can
make it fit you know larger pop like
noses and you know smaller other noses
there's the infrared transmitter so
you've got your USB plug you've got that
connection is for plugging into a
television plugs into I can't even
remember anymore but it comes with the
cable for it and then that wheel right
there you can use it to adjust the the
depth of field I think it is then next
I'm about to show you the DVI to HDMI
cable it comes with nothing special
about that and then next we've got the
two USB a two mini B cables one for the
glasses and one for the infrared
transmitter and on the glasses
themselves you can see the infrared
receiver is actually right there so
that's about the whole modules in that
side of the glasses I think he's gone
and sped up the footage here because I'm
having trouble keeping up okay I'm
showing the Quick Start Guide the
drivers there's a coupon it comes with a
like a warning eye something about you
know if you start bleeding from your
bowels that's bad there's yeah there's a
demo CD and then there's some kind of
coupon I didn't look at it long enough
to figure out what it is and so there's
the 3d glasses and now we're we're on
our way back to the office to do some
actual work and thank you for watching
Linus tech tips he didn't turn this off
when I asked him to there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
