year we would not be here without them
you can check out all their products
that they're launching at this show and
then description the video down below
also thank you to lynda.com all right
guys welcome to the Asus booth or we
will be checking out the Asus GTX 980 TI
Strix and the RGB Claymore keyboard so
what's special about the Strix well it's
featuring new Direct Cu cooling 3
instead of direct Co cooling 2 which has
three fans instead of two fans so if
they seek keep going with this for a
while they'll end up with six fans on
Direct CU 6 but anyways regardless
doesn't matter for heat pipes they've
got two 10 millimeter heat pipes 2 6
millimeter heat pipes and one eight
millimeter heat pipe cooling it and a
new design on those fans but we'll
probably talk about those more later if
we get one of these for review back at
the office in terms of performance
there's some interesting stuff going on
here at first I read the little card it
was like a GPU clock speed to be
determined in memory clock speed to be
determined but then they had their
overclocking software open so I was able
to figure out their temps and everything
but they said it's okay so I'll talk
about it here in OC mode they're running
at 12:47 on the core clock in gaming
mode they're running at 12:28 and in
silent mode they're also running at
12:28 the reason why the difference
between gaming Asylum mode is nothing is
because in silent mode your fans are
going to run a little bit slower and
your temperature will be a little bit
higher but the performance should be
more or less the same also their memory
is running at an unsurprising 7010
megahertz and with GPU tweak 2 you have
a few options I know I already said
something about OC mode and gaming mode
and silent mode but if you go out of the
kind of simple area of GPU tweak to
which you can still see what
everything's currently running at the
charts on the left hand side but if you
go into the like I think it's called
professional tab you can control things
like you would and say afterburner or
GPU tweak 1 or precision or whatever the
heck software you decide to use to
overclock your graphics card now you
might also notice that the cooler is
pretty big it's a little bit longer than
the actual standard PCB and it's a fair
amount taller but it isn't any thicker
so this is a dual slot card not a triple
not a two and a half none of that kind
of stuff so you'll feel the fit fine
with two slots but please do note it is
taller and it is longer when you're
looking for case compatibility
now that's all I can really say outside
of a full proper review of the card but
one more thing I want to point out is
their auto Xtreme technology this is an
industry first 100% automated production
process and material design they've got
a cool little demo here where you can
see the difference between what was
probably soldered by a human and what
was soldered by a machine
pretty cool combination next up is the
Claymore RGB and IO I know I know
another freaking keyboard video from
Luke but it's fairly interesting trust
me okay so it's an RGB keyboard but this
is the first as far as I know
RGB keyboard that is using cherry's RGB
switches that Corsair helped develop
that isn't a Corsair keyboard fairly
interesting I think they have finally
loosed into their iron grip on those
switches now also it's it has it looks
like a ten kilos here but there is
another 10 key module they just don't
have it available that 10 key module
will have a volume slider on it and will
be able to be plugged in independently
so it doesn't actually need to be
plugged directly into the keyboard if
you wanted to use it on a laptop or
whatever you could do that if you put
that 10 key add-on on the right side of
the keyboard it's a normal numpad if you
put that 10 key add-on on the left side
of the keyboard however it's a crazy
macro pad for a huge amount of macros
that you can use a really interesting
way of having that 10 key add-on set up
not interesting enough for you put wait
there's more if you have an ROG
motherboard you can sync your
motherboard and keyboard together and
you can control your CPU fan speed based
on a function key on the keyboard or you
can even have the RGB Ness of your
keyboard reflecting the temperature of
your CPU which is pretty freakin cool
also you can sync a whole bunch of
things together so you can sync your
keyboard and your mouse together to make
all the breathing effects sync together
which is cool I asked if this can also
work with the breathing effect of the
LED on your motherboard considering you
can control other stuff along with your
motherboard
they weren't entirely sure so I'll have
to stay tuned for that let me know what
you guys think about the graphics card
or the keyboard in the description down
below or on twitter at luke underscore
LAF are also thanks to msi for sending
us here this year we totally wouldn't be
here without them check the link in the
description down below that's the bitly
link to see all of their products that
they're releasing here at the show
including a refresh of their laptops
featuring Broadwell processors also
