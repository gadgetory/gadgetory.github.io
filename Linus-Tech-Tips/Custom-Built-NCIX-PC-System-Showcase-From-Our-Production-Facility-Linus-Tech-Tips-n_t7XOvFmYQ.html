through the NCIX production department
and I actually i did my unboxing video
of the corsair 600t a little while back
but i just thought i'd take a moment and
show you like i've actually shown you
systems from the NCIX pc brand before
but we also do custom systems so this is
something that the customer configured
completely on their own so they've put
this together with a corsair 600t
they've got six gigs of ocz ram in here
they've got a core i7 950 with the Susa
Sabretooth top series x58 motherboard
they've got a radeon 5870 a corsair
tx750 and i just thought this is sort of
a pretty good example of what a typical
premium gaming system would look like
with the cable management options that
are present in the 600t it really is a
well-thought-out case you can see that
our production team has gone and used
all of the grommets here to make sure
that the cables that are routed are as
invisible as possible now if the
customer had been using a modular power
supply we wouldn't have this bundle down
here at the bottom but you know you got
to work with what you're given at a
certain level so you know if you go with
an H X series you can hide this bundle
and then it's a very very clean-looking
internal set up so you can see even here
the 8 pin power connector this is why oh
you know what i should say this this is
why i always say in its ideal location
when i'm talking about that 8-pin
connector because many cases these days
have cutouts so that you can route that
very easily and the same with the 24-pin
connector down here that's why I'm
always saying it needs to be on the
right-hand edge of the board because
that's the most convenient way to route
it so I'm going to just go ahead and
turn it around and i want to show you
this is what course are so good at the
back doesn't need to look great because
they've got all this space back here
that no matter how many cables you've
got i mean look at this this is a lot of
cables going down to the bottom of the
board you can tuck them away you can
hide them and you're not going to
interfere with closing your side panel
and it's completely out of the way of
your system air flow so it's just a
great case very smart and this customer
is going with the stock cooler but you
can see here you've got full access to
the back of the motherboard
so all you have to do is pop out those
pushpins put on a back plate you can
install an aftermarket cooler just like
that so that's of course their 600t
system that's just kind of hanging in
