brought to you by phantom glass visit
stores antem glass for the best iron
screen protectors out there as well as
HyperX so I've got my lovely Vanna White
here who thought he was going to hide
throughout the video but of course I'm
not going to not going to let him get
away with that showing off the gt80
Titan SLI dash 0:09
this has been all over the internet as
the world's first maybe for a reason
gaming notebook with a built in Cherry
MX mechanical keyboard so MSI has has
was quick to pull out the key cap puller
and show off that these are not just any
mechanical key switches these are
genuine Cherry MX key switches they also
pointed out that they went to great
lengths to find exactly the right red
LEDs these are not just the standard
provided ones for red LED illuminated
switches so that the keyboard itself is
extremely vibrant even in a bright
situation like the suite that we're
standing in right next to a window right
now now some compromises have to be made
if you're going to make a gaming
notebook with a full thickness
mechanical keyboard so number one is
that you're not going to want to stack
any components under the section of the
notebook where the mechanical keyboard
is here can you turn it to the side so
they can see the profile there we go so
this thickness right here is pure
keyboard along the side all the
components for the notebook itself
including the optical drive the
quad-core CPU and two gtx 980m graphics
cards have to be in this position right
here
now the other compromise you have to
make is that you don't end up with much
of a wrist rest then in this scenario
and I talked to MSI about this and they
kind of went well you know ho-hum you
know engineering is hard and all that
kind of stuff and I and they made some
very good points so I kind of said well
I'd love to have the keyboard here in
the Canon went well then you're going to
have heat from the components on your
wrist then you're not necessarily going
to get that exact profile that people
are used to with mechanical keyboard
because the way that they're shipping
this is with a wrist rest so it's
designed to be used from here now I kind
of went well then I'm a little bit far
away from the screen and the response
was okay well hold on a second it's a
1080p screen and this is
eighteen point whatever eighteen point
four inch screen so you're going to want
to sit a little bit further away from it
anyway and I kind of went okay
Touche on that again and I kind of went
well okay I still think it's huge and
it's still not necessarily made for me
and they went well hold on but wait
Linus there's more we throw in a
backpack that actually fits this
monstrosity so people can use it and
with their new upgrade program that they
introduced last Friday this is I'm not
going to say world's worst of worst
excuse me world's first upgradable
notebook because there have been
notebooks that have been upgradable
before but this is the first one I'm
aware of where there is actually a plan
for an upgrade path so their upgrade
program promises that for to product
generations on GPUs MSI will have
available new MXM modules and new
cooling modules that you can install to
move to the next two generations of high
end graphics cards in here which i think
is a very unique and be pretty freakin
cool
they also made it easily accessible to
get at most of the other upgrades you
might want to do so it's two screws to
pull off this panel I have them take
them off before the video it doesn't
just slide off like that don't worry
it's okay and you can get at the optical
drive you can get at all four of the m2m
SATA SSDs so you can run quad raid you
can get at the two and a half inch hard
drive you can get at two of the four
memory slots the other two are at the
bottom and I guess that's pretty much
all you would really want to get at
wireless module is that accessible from
the bottom yes okay well there you go so
you can get at the wireless module from
the bottom so the idea sorry I'll let
you I'll let you stop being actually
conditioning around we can look at the
back so the idea here is that someone
paying what was it thirty six hundred
dollars for a gaming notebook is
probably going to want to get more than
one typical notebook lifecycle out of it
so they wanted to make it highly
upgradeable in terms of i/o you're going
to have that massive this power brick is
hilarious but is this a 300 watt power
brick 350 watt power brick alright and
it uses a four pin connector here at the
back so you've got Ethernet dual mini
DisplayPort and HDMI back here on this
side you've got a couple USB three
SuperSpeed and then over on this side
you've got three more
usb3 SuperSpeed optical out Kensington
lock SD card reader and a couple audio
jacks now the last thing that I haven't
talked about yet is the unique shape of
the touchpad thank you very much you're
being an excellent Vanna
so in order to make room for the
mechanical keyboard here they didn't
have a whole lot of space for an
additional touchpad and while I looked
at this initially and I kind of went
yeah you guys you guys done goofed
because the screen is shaped this way
and the touchpad is shaped this way it's
actually surprisingly not bad I found
that using it one-handed with my thumb
on the click and my finger on the rest
of the touchpad was actually not a bad
use case scenario for it and another
really cool thing is there's actually an
unlock button up in the corner that you
can press that brings up a I mean are
there's no tactile feel other than a
frankly fairly delayed haptic feedback
but it does at least give you a touch
pad or a number pad if you so desire so
as usual the keyboard is in conjunction
with SteelSeries so I'm assuming it
supports SteelSeries engine okay so it's
only red backlighting so you won't be
doing like fancy rainbow lighting like
on this GT series right here but you
will be able to fully reprogram all the
keys just like you would be able to on a
normal MSI gaming notebook very cool
stuff so that's the GT 80 Titan SLI 0:09
guys thanks for checking out this video
don't miss any of our CES coverage
remember our trip to the show this year
is brought to you by phantom glass the
makers of in our minds the best screen
protectors for your phone on the market
they're made of Gorilla Glass they use a
nano coating on the bottom so it's
pretty much impossible from my
experience to get an air bubble in them
and they are as clear and as pleasing to
use as the glass that's already on your
phone assuming you have a high end
device as well as HyperX so check out
the YouTube channel that's youtube.com
slash HyperX for great gaming content
over there thanks again for watching and
