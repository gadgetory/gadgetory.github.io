time for quietly reflecting on my
feelings but when I do there's one
burden that weighs on me mighty heavily
a Dark Passenger I've never shared with
any man that the poor CPU and my gaming
PC is cooled by the pathetic heatsink
that came in its box I wrote that I
didn't want better for it's just well
it's like that time I drove for days
because it seemed better than asking for
directions I just didn't know how to
pick one but thanks to the Internet and
now I can know enough about any subject
to make video guides without ever
admitting I had no pre-existing
knowledge on the subject and that's how
this one came to be I started by
learning about so called compatibility
my case can handle a four and
three-quarter inch radiator that's a
hundred and twenty millimeters if you're
some kind of sissy or Canadian but as a
rugged man I believe bigger is better
so after consulting my manual I
eventually chose a 240 millimeter
radiator the largest I could fit in the
top of my case when selecting a tool to
remove the unholy abomination that I
knew was currently possessing my PC
thankfully mercy stayed my hand a true
rugged man knows use the right tool for
the job i unscrewed one corner and then
the opposite one and then the other two
in rapid succession before tearing that
sucker off to see my processor looking
at me with a mixture of fatigue and
relief across its heat spreader for the
next step I gathered the parts I'd need
out of the cooler box two cooling fans
and the mounting hardware from my socket
that I hmm well I wish I'd looked at
that before confidently chucking the
manual in the trash which led me to the
most important fork in the road of my
life I'd ever encountered a burn in
question that needed answer and before I
could go any further push or pull
thankfully I found this great video on
the subject this guy is anything but
ruggedly he suggested having my fans
pull air through the radiator and out of
the case for a good balance of overall
system cooling and ease of cleaning
then I can certainly appreciate I ran
the long screws through the top of the
case and the four corners of the fans
like a spit through a pig then after
some fiddling about got the first one
threaded and from there it got much
easier to mount the radiator then I
screwed the hold down plate to the CPU
block attached my hardware to the
motherboard put on some thermal goop and
tightened the hold down screws in a
cross pattern before plug in power leads
from a fan's and pump either directly
into the board for automatic controller
into the power supply if I don't mind
them running at full manly speed all the
time with my work complete I
contemplated sacrifices I've made
because while frankly the practical
benefits of CPU liquid cooling with
longer life and marginally better
overclock and being among them are
debatable at best what it was really
about for me was knowing my Battlefield
rig weren't relying on the equivalent of
a gentle beatin of pixie wings to keep
her running smooth thank you for
