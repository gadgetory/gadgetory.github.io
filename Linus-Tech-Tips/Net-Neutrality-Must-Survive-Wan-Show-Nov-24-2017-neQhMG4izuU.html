interests we've had you know welcome to
the night time pot I haven't even gotten
that much done this week like here let
me let me have a look we use we use
Trello now which is actually pretty cool
I actually really like it so we use
Trello to track all of our tasks and and
everything Trello is pretty cool and so
this week I actually only got like five
five videos shot of which I scripted
none of them so like on paper I got not
a whole lot done this week but big
meetings I had to have a lot of meetings
and there is something about meetings
that just makes you just just hate
yourself at the end of the day and then
hate yourself some more at the end of
the week and then just when you're done
hating yourself you hate your life and
yeah meeting sock so you never know like
okay did we did we cover enough stuff
and then if you do cover a new stuff the
new question is did we cover too many
things in waste time yeah so I mean yeah
I got everything that I needed to to end
like honestly the stuff that we did this
week was pretty cool so we finally
covered the porsche design laptop the
evie tablet that surface competitor
that's like a few hundred dollars
cheaper okay and great build quality
great specs comes with the keyboard
cover and a stylus so we got a resent of
thing that doesn't happen anymore Dell
sent us over what has to be the most
badass projector that I've yet seen oh
and you're into protectors HDR it's the
laser it's 5,000 lumens Wow and it's
4500 bucks which is a lot of money go
buy a hundred inch HD r 4k TV yeah they
get quite expensive yes once you get up
there in five thousand lumens like
obviously it's not gonna work in a
bright room with the Sun coming in the
way that a TV might yeah
but in a dim room but with the blinds up
the Sun was probably gonna set in about
half an hour it was super usable like
very usable even with some of the lights
on in the room so I was super if you
live up here it'll just always work
great yeah we don't have Sun anymore
well not this time of year yeah and then
John did a smart Christmas lights
roundup okay I heard about this yes how
was that John was like super into this
he was like hey so I think honestly I
don't think he's bringing any of that
stuff back I don't I think he's just
keeping it because I think his ulterior
motive is that he's just into decoration
in a way that I don't think most of the
other people here really are yeah
yep and and he's into like celebrating
festivities yeah yeah like his tree was
up it was badass when I went over there
and the festive spirit yeah so so I
think he just had an ulterior motive
that was he wanted cool smart Christmas
lights and he figured hey I know that
was part of it if I make a video about
this then I'll just keep them yeah so we
made that video how is it though like
how was it um most of them are terrible
as you yeah so he didn't get a lot of
great lights out of it but he did get a
couple of those Philips I look at you
goes which he really likes yeah I was
gonna ask Philips make a set because
there's stuff seems to be pretty good
yeah so Philips was the only one that
had an app that wasn't total ass but
it's not like proper Christmas lights
I'm assuming no no it's just Philips hue
but like green and red which is the
thing that Philips you does yes last one
was we're doing our test build on air
cooling in the Corsair concept slate the
largest case of that not ever but
certainly the largest yeah happening the
certainly the largest case from a a
mainstream case manufacturer like
mountain mods has done stuff like an
ascension duality is gonna be bigger how
big is it compared to that huge fan tax
case ah you know what I don't know the
fan tax ones
Malinda case labs has definitely done
something bigger the TX 10 v or
something
like ginormous like dual ATX yeah yeah
like just redonkulous you know from it
like a normal case manufacturer like
your Corsair your thermal take your an
tack all those guys this is the biggest
that I've seen it's like curved tempered
glass I'm like wow like I know like I
know with with cases like this it's not
about selling a whole bunch of them yeah
I wonder how many they really think
they're going to sell and I don't mean
really in like a derogatory way like I
wonder like when they're like okay let's
make this case like forecasting you have
to get forecasting by like what is the
number i desided care probably not I
like I wondered yeah I actually don't
think they care it's just to show up I
think this one is just
okay you can't tool a case for less than
a half a million dollars yeah I'll tell
you that much this one was a lot more
than that yeah and hurts tempered alone
I'm sure is like not fun they're not
gonna sell a ton of them because if I
had to guess and I'd be completely
guessing have no information if I had to
guess I'd say the Coursera concept slate
is probably gonna cost five hundred to
six hundred and fifty US dollars so like
this is not this is not gonna put my
hand up to guess and was like five okay
yeah so I think we're on the same page
there and I was thinking that or higher
so that that works I'm just gonna
alright guys so we're here in the
Corsair suite where they have I would
love to say of the GTX a lot more times
I think it's like three eight times the
internal I know
on earth would you do right down here at
the bottom and they've even got a bunch
of hardline and hopefully hopefully will
do a great job like is it just like a
crazy build or is there like a specific
point it's like the screaming the
powerful one is the work station okay so
for poor quadros yeah um 128 gigs of ram
18 core processor Oh like basically the
finest the absolute best okay and then
the gaming machine is a capable gaming
machine that's like hiding in there so
it's a 7700 K with a 1080 Ti okay and 32
gigs of ram so while your thing is
rendering on your multiple Quadros you
can still game it absolute felicity yeah
you can get one of us so Wendell over at
level one Tex is he seeing his kvms
I believe they're actually available on
the store right now but he's got two
different models and they're DisplayPort
kvms so we've actually got one of them
in I've been waiting icing yeah so he's
making yeah this product that already
existed but he basically made firmware
for it that isn't trash that's cool so
right up until now a DisplayPort KVM has
been pretty hard to come by especially
one that isn't total yeah okay that that
asterisk on the end is super important
so it's DisplayPort 1.2 it passes
through free sync as far as I know and
he's even gotten it working passing
through G sync the tallboy model is five
hundred and fifty dollars but it is a
dual monitor KVM okay
so you would actually be able to run
this in fact that's what we should
probably do Jake in the in the showcase
like show off video for this one is we
should have two monitors and then you
can actually switch between your two
systems like that and it does audio oh
yeah it's like totally badass it's USB 3
it's like it's like crazy crazy amazing
that's the okay so so the table model is
the dual monitor one yeah that's the
main D and then the four there's the
quad poor single monitor one so you can
switch between four different systems
that one's like 330 bucks or something
like yes you've got you're looking at
396 for the single monitor so that much
okay and 664 okay so I have had the
pricing totally wrong so yeah man that's
US dollars by the way oh
I mean they look sick yeah and you know
for for a high plug count KVM that's
actually not unreasonable there's
something there's some that you can get
at quite a bit cheaper but not not
anywhere close to that feature sense
yeah I mean you can spend you can spend
that kind of money on VGA KVM still
depending on the features yeah so people
are asking for a link I'll drop one in
chat yeah all right thanks all right why
don't we how do we roll the intro crap
well we have good topics trust me
well--there's hey if you're logged into
twitch is there an easy way to get me an
authentication thing because otherwise I
have to go on to the thing and I have to
do the whole thing oh all right yeah
yeah okay that's fine um
all right well if I whispered in head
gestures while we're live on stream yeah
how's it going
SAP what do you what is for what that
for this yeah you don't need that I
don't need that no well how do I do it
are you sure I'm pretty sure are you are
you not logged in no try to log in this
is a new laptop okay turtle again I
already did what what oh wait okay hold
on I got this okay cool okay you know
what we'll get back to you on that
actually we won't at all so don't worry
about it okay so the iMac Pro this was
originally posted by red round 2 I'm
posting the link in the twitch chat now
the original article is from 9 to 5 Mac
and apparently it's going to feature an
a-10 fusion processor inside so oh wow
that's weird
what is that oh hold on oh that was
close
I mean it would have just shown me my
topic so I'm actually working on my reel
oh yeah it does good cool I'm working on
my review of the new blade stealth this
is the quad core model okay so I'm super
loose doped on this thing so far
actually wow you didn't just include it
in your other blade review no wow wow
what just milking videos what are you
talking about
you're drunk way to go you're drunk
they're both blades you should include
in the same video
I shouldn't have to watch two different
videos with blades and you know what
I can't be milking it because it's
obviously gonna get demonetized does the
word blade in it so wait did that happen
no well ok yes but not got it back okay
that was like six years ago back when I
did an unboxing of the original razor
blade
I had some I had some keywords in the
description about razors switchblade
interface which at the time I said I
didn't think made a ton of sense and it
got it got blunt cans so fast you
remember that thing right with the
displays behind the programmable buttons
yeah it was just so expensive and nobody
cared it was pretty bad it also was
buggy yeah anyway so it got demonetized
and I had to appeal it I filmed that
video yeah that makes sense yeah yep
yeah I was a long time ago I remember
and neither of okay so the iMac Pro to
feature a 10 fusion coprocessor
processor possibly for always-on hey
Siri you know okay so I've got a couple
things to say here number one is that I
was super confused when I read the
headline for this and I was like oh an
a-10 fusion coprocessor that's like oh
that's weird
why would it why would they put an APU
in there yeah that's exactly what I
thought too because I was Andy has their
lineup of a 1080p use and then fusion
was what AMD was calling what they were
gonna call their cpu GPU hybrid products
that just ended up being ap use but
there was really nothing hybrid about
them they were just you know CPUs with
onboard graphics anyway Fusion was the
branding that they were gonna use for
that house like oh yeah a confusion and
because I don't follow Apple as closely
as I follow PC stuff like yes you know a
11 Bionic a 10 fusion I'm sure that lots
of Apple people would have gone to makes
complete sense
oh and a 10 fusion like the you know
iPhone 7 but I didn't and I'm dumb and
you can all have a nice little laugh at
me and anyway so point number one is I
got confused
haha and point number two is that I
think this is great
yeah I mean sure it's gonna handle
smaller more different tasks like
hosting
hey Siri always on so you would just be
able to say hey Siri to your computer
yeah which would be cool I guess if you
do that first
there's so many mics in our houses now
it's kind of ridiculous but you know
whatever not in mind that you're already
being monitored by Wow oh yeah I mean
phone yes yeah phone yes yeah
hey Siri now yeah well you probably have
one on you no I do not have an iPhone on
me right now you usually do that I
usually do it was a good good as a
SmartWatch yes yeah I don't know if it
has a mic but a lot of them do actually
and you swapped it quite often it's true
a lot of mics this is a pro track it's
actually kind of cool we did like a
sponsored spot for it but I'm not being
paid to wear it right now I like it it's
it's got two screens so this is a dumb
screen
oh is it in overtime okay yeah remember
when these first came out and we were
both talking about how this is how they
would have to do it yeah yeah it's so
cool guys it lasts for like another
month and a half yeah yeah yeah and it's
just a watch and like honest tons of
saying I get so many notifications that
it's impractical to manage them from my
wrist anyway so I've but I got back in
the habit of wearing a watch well yes
I'm like I'm wearing a watch now and
that's cool because like I don't know if
it is charged sweet because
notifications on your wrist it's not
charged whatever yeah like I can tell
someone's calling me when I leave my
phone it's not a useless thing strapped
to your wrist right which is cool but
anyway I'm glad they're doing this
either way because this has been a thing
that has confused me for a number of
years why is it that there is anything
that this can do that my laptop in my
desktop can't that's so stupid
yeah so I mean to add to that list
why does my laptop not have GPS it would
be great for and I know they can tell
where your laptop yeah great tech
quickie coming on how they know where
your laptop is that pretty well it can
do that really well which is swell but
that won't necessarily help with like
I'll find my laptop feature for example
right as it is those all refer are
refer those all rely on the same Wi-Fi
positioning that your Google Maps would
for example but this coprocessors isn't
gonna give you no I'm just I'm just
adding to my list of things that every
device should just support and for some
reason they write but every device isn't
gonna have a sim card ok well ok there's
another great question why the actual
hell does every device not have
somewhere that I can pop a SIM card yeah
it probably should especially because
and it should be more standard for phone
companies to just like I don't know
charge you five bucks for the sim but
not charge you anything on top of that
monthly right the monthly fees shouldn't
go up you should pay for the hardware
cuz you have to ship it or whatever but
I just don't get it yeah how is this how
is this not obvious yeah you know would
be really sick if I could have a sim in
my laptop my phone my switch yeah like
everything and I just pulls from my one
pool of available I have like other
stuff on my list I can't I can't
remember for the life of me right now
what yeah I'm you know ok biometrics
took forever and are still taking
forever on laptops and desktops
whereas they've been standard on mobile
devices for about three years now
yeah like Windows hello is the thing
yeah but that's very soon and not stand
not standard at all yeah so yeah there's
just like there's a bunch of stuff like
that but I just look at but why why can
phones do this and for some reason we
aren't building this functionality and
tell their devices drives me crazy the
LG Graham gen 3 that just rolled in ok
and it's got this jank tastic
fingerprint scanner on the top left of
the trackpad that is not touch sensitive
so you can just like run over it and
like your touchpad doesn't work there
and I'm sitting here going like we've
had we've had touch we've had touch ID
slash fingerprint scanners built into
everything from side buttons to back
buttons to front buttons to to fricking
oh why they don't even cost much you
look at the you look at the tear downs
for these phones okay and it to be clear
I don't think it's as simple as if the
bomb cost for a phone like the iPhone 10
is rumored to be went through three
hundred and thirty dollars three hundred
forty three seventy whatever it is it's
somewhere in the 250 to 350 range
something like that and to be clear I'm
not saying oh well then it should be
$4.99 because unlike some people I do
understand that there's a lot of costs
associated with bringing a product to
market including like really including
the long term support of said product
something that Apple does generally
pretty well and like literally zero
dollar inclusion cost for all of the
operating system and software yes okay
so you know I'm also not saying they're
not making enough money like they're
clearly really making a lot of money but
my point is that when you look at these
tear downs the kinds of parts that I'm
complaining about I'm not even asking
necessarily for a for a cellular radio
to be built into the device I'm asking
why the actual crap we didn't have a
standard created five to eight years ago
where every motherboard just has a spot
where you can plug it in why don't we
have a couple like we're talking little
tiny copper wires for antennas to have a
way to add this functionality very
easily be built into the screen and it
does exist it's just something that's
really not very common and another
actually used to be more common another
example is something like it did to back
when like Express cards were um and
clearly it went away because there
wasn't a ton of demand for it but cell
phone plans used to be exorbitantly
expensive yeah and and to be able to
have something like data was like like
yeah it was it was almost non-existent
and someone in the chat has actually
brought up I lost the comment now I'm
sorry but they said family plan sim
grouping I've heard that it's way more
common in the States and it's starting
to definitely be a thing in Canada but
that's still not like a default thing no
and and to be and like if you include
the plans even if they exist and you can
get them for businesses as well the
plans even if they exist
don't have device support so it's like I
can't just pop a sim in my blade stealth
which I should be able to yeah so my
point then is that on a thousand dollar
device or a fourteen hundred dollar
device I think this one's a 512 gig and
this is about a $1600 device I think
they could have absorbed a slot for a
SIM card I think they could have
absorbed a fingerprint scanner that
isn't trash and that sits under a
touch-sensitive surface like a trackpad
and you know what I think they probably
also could have absorbed you look at how
much the camera sensors cost for even a
rear camera honest on a cell phone yeah
it is a trivial amount why is every
webcam not as good as like the one plus
five T's rear camera why and what's the
excuse latch our cameras are actually
like disgustingly bad and laptop mics oh
they could be a lot better man so yeah I
guess that's it I'm I was mad now I've
got it out of my system I'll get mad
about it again at some point but I'm
over it for now yeah what else do we
have for topics today okay yeah why
don't we do this before the sponsors oh
boy Intel finds critical holes is a
secret brutal management engine so this
was posted by cubes the gamer on the
forum I'm gonna pull up the original
article from the register and I think
Luke's probably better qualified to go
through well this is some this is some
pretty ridiculous stuff why this is a
big deal it's a fairly self-explanatory
uh there's there's firmware level vlog
bugs that allow logged in administrators
or some other people you can access it
over the network which is extremely
scary yeah logged in administrators and
high privileged processes so programs
doesn't have to be a user to run code
beneath the operating system to spy on
or meddle with the computer completely
outside of other users or admins now
that's not the only scary part because
it's going on to the processor you can
access things that are in memory
so you can like screw with other
programs and you can take things from
other programs so meanwhile hold on can
I jump in and ask a question oh you're
gonna ask a dumb question okay now
typically something like a password in a
perfect world in a perfectly coded
websites and or piece of soft it has to
be moved around but at some points in
time would stay encrypted theoretically
end-to-end but in practice there is
sometimes while it's being moved around
where it might not be encrypted for a
jump she's got it it should be encrypted
the whole time so if something has
access to memory it can grab stuff that
would otherwise be possible I think so
and what could be really bad about that
is you could change something right so
while the program is running you could
change something that's in memory
crashing it in a really special way or
like altering something then right so
it's an exploit that opens up to the
potential for many other exploits yeah I
have obviously never screwed with
something like this before but it's it's
pretty brutal here we go to do their
direct quote the flaws could allow an
attacker to impersonate the MESP S or T
XE mechanisms that's referring to
management engines service platform
services or a trusted execution engine
which is a great name right now thereby
invalidating local security features
like what you're just talking about load
and execute arbitrary code outside of
the visibility of the user and the
operating system this is where some of
the special concepts like from your
antivirus get owned so you can crash
affected systems extremely easily this
way brutal the things affected are six
generations seventh generation and
eighth generation Intel Core processors
so long Intel Xeon e3 1200 v5 and v6
processors Intel Xeon scalable
processors Intel Xeon w processors Intel
Atom C 3002 be 900 series processors
Apollo Lake Intel Pentium cell
on N and seller on J series and risin
seven no I'm just kidding it's all Intel
oh boy the holes can also be exploited
by network administrators this was the
part that I really didn't like the rest
of them are pretty brutal the fact that
there can be an attack vector it's all
that I mean it's all brutal what we're
talking like we're talking like AIDS
birthday cake like does it really matter
what's nice you take the problem that I
have with this is it's it's it's quite
easy to social engineer your way onto
someone's Wi-Fi right it's it's like
it's it's been proved so many times that
in so many different situations you can
get onto someone's Wi-Fi pretty easily
whether you overhear someone asking for
a password or if you just oh man I
really need to do whatever it oftentimes
people will let you on the Wi-Fi and
then getting up to administrator access
usually not the hardest thing once
you're already on the network anyways
exploited by network administrator's or
people masquerading as admins like I
just said to remotely infect machines
with spyware and invisible rootkits oh
god Wow
it's not it's not good it's really bad
okay yeah honestly for the link I'll
drop the link yeah so far so far I don't
think intel has a plan it's a firmware
level thing so at the best-case scenario
the best-case scenario is they might be
able to patch this via a BIOS update
which is a terrible solution because I
understand this too this is fun not
every BIOS update updates
Emme yeah okay and in fact I ran into an
issue a little while back where I forget
what exactly the problem was I oh man
there's this thing with I think it's a
soos not a soos it's it's what I think
it was with z170 boards I think it's
generation can't remember exactly anyway
the point is that you have to do like
some kind of CPU juggling in order to
first flash so you have to go back to
like an old CPU to flash the enemy I
think you actually have to do something
in OS then you have to pop that and you
have to put in a new one you have to
flash the BIOS with that then you have
to like put in the old but like it's
some stupid juggling act like I wish I
could remember but I wasted like three
hours of my time a while back do you
remember
87 to 97 is that right is the 80 79 no
it's all of them ASIS just has it
documented so you know what to do um
anyway the point is I believe the issue
there was that Emme
couldn't be updated while you had the
one CPU but it could for the other the
point is best-case scenario they can
update this with a BIOS flash but that
relies on a number of things it relies
on the manufacturer of the actual
motherboard to do something with okay
relies on Intel to provide a fix it
relies on the manufacturer to do
something with that fix it relies on the
manufacturer to communicate to the
end-user that they need to apply that
fix it relies on the end-user being able
to run a BIOS update to be able to run a
BIOS up that's that's like the worst I
mean we're talking stuff going back to
6th gen I mean there's there's stuff I
mean especially when you start getting
into like om systems like Dells and HP's
there are systems that are not that
simple
to run a BIOS update on like when you
consider that the average user is
intimidated by pressing delete and being
presented with all these scary options
so someone in the chat sorry so I'm
gonna the chat brought up like processes
can edit memory for other processes yeah
I know that's already a thing but this
is undetectable by the operating system
which is like the reason why it's about
permission and and and it like it's it's
that's a whole nother level
and you can screw with things without
being caught and a lot of things are
going to be caught by windows okay so
I'm not done yet it relies on the end
user to be arsed to go and deal with it
because for someone who doesn't know how
to update a BIOS there's probably let's
say conservatively an hour of their life
that they have to set aside to learn
about this issue figure out how to do it
and actually do it there's gonna be I
mean there's good okay
okay I know that it's that it's unlikely
but any machines that you know
experience a power loss during this
update well they're gonna be bricked
they're gonna need to be replaced so
there's gonna be a service cost
associated with this like this is
terrible I'd love to hear Wendell talk
about this and we brought Wendell up on
this stream I just thought about him
that would be cool
so this this to me seems really bad
mainly because you're going below OS
level so you can do essentially whatever
the hell you want that's the scary thing
for me you can screw with other programs
you can make it look like other programs
are doing the thing that you're doing
that's the stuff that's freaking me out
but I really wonder what someone like
Wendell thinks yeah at the business side
of thing going things going this will
not get fixed yeah like that that is the
truth
yeah there will be many many millions of
pcs out there that will be affected by
this forever
pretty much how often people update
their boss in like the people that are
watching this yeah like the people that
are at this family I have a Saturday
night Saturday night calendar reminder I
got some wine and some cheese and up
Dima BIOS like it's I don't know it was
like three different ones and then I
switched I mean after that it's not
common there I would almost bet that
probably above eighty percent of other
warts never received one random
statistic that I just pulled out of my
butt but it's yeah it's probably pretty
high all right
so in other news if your computer is
doomed but at least your cum you want
somewhere to put your but that's
comfortable then there's always need for
C whoo need for seat USA sells quality
ergonomic computer office and PC
gaming chairs to the US and Canada and
they now offer embroidery check that out
line is set Linus tech toots Luke at
floatplane Media you're gonna need a new
one
custom embroidery on many Mac's anomic
chair models in the pro gaming office
office comfort and XL series sections so
the embroiderer is in-house so the
turnaround time is just a couple days
and they've got a preview tool on their
website that allows you to type in a
name and get a preview image logo
embroidery can be requested through
email it's support it need for seat
usa.com and honestly these guys are
awesome we've been working with them a
long time and I've had my butt sitting
on one of their chairs for over three
years now yeah a long time and it is
exactly like the day I started they do I
will I will definitely give them that
they have quite the durability yeah the
the foam that they use is like I forget
what they call it it's like a cold
something cold molded foam and whatever
the point is that it doesn't it doesn't
just sink in and then sink in more and
then eventually like my Costco chair
that I threw away eventually you're just
sitting on to great supply would yeah
that's my current situation at home so
for Black Friday they're offering
seventy-five bucks off the purchase of
any max anomic chair with code Turkey 75
all caps valid until November 29 so go
check that out
oh you know what let's do let's do G
fuel first okay I'm going for the
no-look pass you ready yep oh did I was
I gonna hit myself is that a good throw
yeah yep okay why are you freaking out
maybe I was they were all like curvy
they all ended like right here what are
you scared I felt like I felt like I
kind of went too far up and it was gonna
come right down and hit me on the head
anyway G fuel is the sugar free powdered
energy drink makes currently available
in 18 flavors created by gamma labs with
the goal being to create an alternative
to sugar loaded canned energy drinks so
mission accomplished because there's no
sugar and it does
come in a can right yeah no I mean if
that's the mission that make sense
anyway of how it works is you choose
your fuel so you select your drink mix
you get delivery and it's fast they ship
it to you you add water do you mix it
into a glass or shaker cup filled with
16 ounces of water and enjoy boom it
comes in tubs boxes containing single
serve packs or the single serve packs
themselves there are there are actually
a lot of people here at the office that
as far as I can tell if they stopped
eating food altogether would still have
enough energy to get through the day
because they drink so much G fuel
talking about you Jonah
yeah Jon Coulton yeah a cult and drink
so much G fuel it said still I am pretty
sure ed still drinks I'm pretty sure
yeah but the thing with Ed is I'm pretty
sure he would drink anything that gives
him a rush yeah G feel it's just that I
don't think he's that bitchy
it's like turpentine faster so sure for
Black Friday they're featuring a buy one
tub get one free sale it's valid till
November 26th so you've only got a
couple of days go check it out at G fuel

first you can't enjoy the Moho after the
go exactly yeah so I'm gonna go home
first and then I'm gonna do ghost pepper
tell you what after I've had some maple
buffalo bacon I'll do ghost pepper to
solidarity
okay all right yeah anyway offer code bf
2017 to save 20% on their products all
this weekend and all orders placed using
that code you'll get a free cozy as well
I was calling a koozie before because I
didn't actually know what it was it's
one of those things that goes on your
drink that keeps it from keeps it warm
or cold as it were insulating sleeve so
I don't think it's in the dog but yeah
the chat is talking about
oh I'll use a light term of aggravated
because we're not talking about net
neutrality yeah
ah okay I don't see it in the dog no
I'll start in there um honestly the
reason that it's not in there and the
reason that we haven't made a video is
that we already made a video we've
already talked about it before alum
I mean the the cynic in me is kind of
looking at everybody jumping on this
bandwagon going like like are you just
out for views like why do you only care
now when it's trendy maybe I'm wrong
maybe I'm wrong maybe it's not like that
but I just posted a video on the twitch
chat it's more than trendy right now
it's like coming up again
well I know that I know that the debate
is sort of on right now but here's the
problem
so we already did that video that I
posted two years ago it's quite good
news and there's nothing that we didn't
already say net neutrality is good you
should care if you don't understand that
for whatever reason then I'm sorry we
can't yeah basically if we we can't do
this because we're in Canada and it's
not an issue up here because you know
but if you're in the States you should
be contacting local representatives
there's what's the website fight for the
net or something I see sorry this wasn't
a prepped topic thanks for the net
battle for the Netcom funny because it's
battlenet I'll drop it in the chat
there's a contact them button which I'm
pretty sure if you put in like your your
information it like helps you reach out
to congressman congressman and represent
eight representatives and Congress women
in Congress whatever they identify as
yes we didn't assume anything yep sorry
yeah we're treading on a sensitive topic
right now so let's make sure we're yeah
yeah let's make sure nobody nobody melts
but this website is a good resource for
a ton of different stuff if you're
looking for more information on it
reddit is so over this we've got some
people upset because I basically said
anyone who doesn't understand that it's
good needs to get themselves
re-evaluated I think there are better
ways to fix the internet than through
regulation that's nice but the problem
is that this regulation exists to fix
other regulation so unless you want to
actually deregulate which nobody's
calling for
oh really unless you want to actually
deregulate then nothing can be done and
if you were to actually fully deregulate
everything it would create a whole host
of other problems as well because one of
the only reasons that smaller ISPs and
smaller telcos can exist is the fact
that this copper that was in Canada I
believe it was so he okay here in BC I'm
more familiar with our local stuff
you'll have to forgive me but this is
one of the reasons we don't talk about
it too much
yeah would have been BC tailed back in
the day yeah and they were the ones who
owned all the copper because they were
the ones who existed before the friggin
internet and only certain people are
allowed to put down copper because
you're using government land to put the
copper down I mean the last thing that
you want is like I've been to developing
countries where the telephone poles are
literally just covered in every random
wire and people like I saw people you
know they're not wearing safety vests
they don't have a truck with a logo on
it they're just like up there like
running stuff yeah that's actually a
problem too
that's a huge problem you have to
regulate this stuff there is no removing
all the regulation and the regulation
that is net neutrality exists to counter
the other regulation that has to exist
that creates unfair advantages for
certain companies that's all there is to
it there is no debate the only debate is
who's getting paid say you go so there's
people in chat that are like you clearly
haven't a clue what gee pies and
tensions are Brit Brit know we know
what's going on we're on your side stop
it like honestly we are on your side
because it actually does matter like
even though we're Canadian and this
doesn't theoretically affect us it's
super does guys because so much of our
infrastructure and the world's for that
matter is reliant on what the
regulations are for the Internet in the
United States not to mention that the
Canadian government has a long and proud
history of just kind of
King sell that what's going on and kind
of going okay that looks alright
apparently that won't happen at least
with our current guy yeah but you know
there's always who knows who gets
elected next yeah and stuff so there you
go you're Canadian
I'm out anyway so there that's all I had
to say on it do you have anything like
okay one of my big things a lot of
people bring up the idea of like
internet fast leads and like when you go
to battle for the Netcom there's like a
fake oh loading icon at the top and
stuff that's not the only problem in
countries where this isn't a thing where
they don't have net neutrality set up
there's there's been some screenshots
going around of flight I don't remember
which country it was but the second you
try to open a browser it redirects you
to a page and it's essentially a micro
transaction store for being able to
access websites and you get like a
certain amount of data or a certain
amount of time on a certain website and
you have to buy it with like coins that
you have for that website it's it's
beautifully garbage and the issue that
comes up with this is like I had to
scroll down the list for a while to find
facebook Messenger because there's so
many websites that people use these days
that are super mainstream and including
games and all these other kind of things
that you don't realize that some of the
things that you use might fall down
below other stuff and someone says
tunnel bear yeah that's great except
that VPN traffic works because the ISP
lets everything through there know that
it's VPN traffic they just have to let
it through if it's now on a whitelist
system they'll just block all of that so
get on or slow it down or slow it down
yeah in some situations though you can
block it yeah they'll go oh you're
encrypted I don't like it
yeah I don't know whatever it is I don't
care I don't know what the Americans
specific version if they'll be able to
block websites but like there was an
issue up here and I don't know what
actually happened with it but tell us a
local is B tell us decided to block the
website I can't support you guys anymore
if you support pie
we're not what can we say that sounded
like are you not in favor of net
neutrality
I know it's legal in a lot of places but
hold off on the reefer for a moment
they're like look I don't know where
that came from unless you're super
stoned there's there's issues with small
business right now we are in like
Amazon's North America
I know Facebook is huge I know Apple is
huge I know all these other companies
are huge we are in Amazon's North
America and Amazon is gobbling up small
business there's a lot of small business
that still exists on the web whether
that's brick-and-mortar that do a lot of
work through the web or advertised
through the web or have a website where
people can see all their stuff whatever
all of that is going to get less traffic
if it's slow and crappy or if you have
to pay to access it than other things
this was extremely damaged small
business yeah there you apparently I'm
faking it I don't know what I'm faking
it's not an orgasm though if I was
faking that you'd know it would be
really convincing all right let's move
on to the next topic shall we do you not
know that
well no you'd know that I was doing
something right yeah even though
something was going on
ah the original article here there's
there's I don't I don't like the obscene
pitchfork hanging I like I don't
understand at all how anyone thought
that we were defending what are you
doing I fight with reason guys come on
um yeah well when you don't have it you
can't reach for whatever weapons in the
arse again I'm happy that you happen to
be fighting for the same side that I'm
on but like come on easy easy easy brain
a little bit okay okay last thing I'll
mention is that some people were
pointing out that those Portugal
screenshots were a little bit
misrepresentative of what was going on
Andrew but actually changes nothing
yeah about any of this and I'm not super
surprised because the only answer is
treating the internet like a utility
yeah that's the only one okay phone
lines are great
so BGR teases a potential Galaxy X a
bendable phone Wow also one thing that I
want to say on that topic yeah man if if
Portugal screenshot thing is fake don't
share it fake news stuff is not gonna
help your argument yeah it doesn't help
anybody
it hurts your argument you're gonna get
caught you're gonna look like an idiot
anyways moving forward so the galaxy X
looks nothing like the iPhone X so
that's cool um well we have here in
terms of leaks we know that it's
supposed to be bendable you've been
trying to work on this for years now
bendable displays have been considered
kind of like a sort of a holy brewery
futuristic technology yeah bendable
battery that like yeah but it's the
bendable display we've seen that like
weird conferences you've seen people
doing it for a while the bendable
battery dress that's that's very
interesting for me so support page went
up on Samsung's website for an SMG 888
and 0 no information on what it is but
that model number has been associated
with galaxy X many times in the past it
already received various certifications
from regulators Wow including the Wi-Fi
Alliance and Bluetooth SIG so the rumor
is that the device will be so
complicated to manufacture that it might
see a limited launched before Samsung is
able to produce it on mass so this is
something Samsung's done before just
doing a limited release in South Korea
for example and then figuring out when
if ever to roll it out to the rest of
the world at a later date I personally
think that this is gonna be a really
interesting device because for the first
time in I don't know the last okay
you'll have to forgive me if I've missed
a bunch in between because there was
there have been big chunks of time when
I haven't really paid much attention to
mobile phones but the last time that I
remember a phone that was really sold
based on being a fashion statement
aside from Apple because Apple does
position their phone that way but they
do it subtly like they have they try to
sell you FaceTime or that you're gonna
be do a pic kickflips or whatever and
your friends are gonna record you in
slow mode it's can be like awesome
like they it's more of a like a
lifestyle brand whereas the last phone
that I remember that was really about
how cool it looks and how cool you're
gonna look when you use it was the
Motorola RAZR yeah yeah that's that
phone was absolutely about that that was
what it was all about don't think anyone
actually cared about any other part of
it no so it was a pain to use it was
like actually two things I never had one
yeah so I never had one either but like
I touched one I was like yeah this is
super dumb um so this since then would
be maybe if not the first the best
example I've seen because I don't think
this thing is gonna be powerful I don't
think it's gonna be powerful and I think
it's gonna have to not be powerful
because they're gonna have to make
compromises on things like battery life
I don't think the display is necessarily
gonna be the highest resolution because
this brand new manufacturing technology
we're talking about so I think this is
going to be the phone that is pure
fashion statement and it's going to
finally happen where phones have gotten
powerful enough for most people that
you'll be able to produce something with
very mainstream specs and that's what I
think this will have that is just cool
and that's kind of that's actually quite
exciting so I was talking to someone
about this he was literally last night
about how phones have gone to the point
where like they're all pretty much the
same there isn't really a lot going on
like like the the craziest thing that
happened was Apple released like a
really weird phone and like they like
turned the camera thing which was a
fashion thing related to razor like
you're talking about earlier or the the
was it called that really thin phone the
Motorola RAZR Motorola ready yeah okay
let's just making sure that I didn't
pull that name in um but but but like
it's it's it's mostly a fashion phone
with like weird face recognition stuff
and that's not that surprising and
Samsung going in a similar location is
is actually with the same name which is
hilarious is it's probably good because
in terms of internals there's not a lot
going on they all the same freaking
processor they're all running the same
freaking stuff it's become boring the
battle for the inside of the phone
mm-hmm yeah it's um I've reviewed a lot
of phones in the last couple of months
and they've all been pretty similar yeah
so so doing something interesting with
the body of the phone is out cool that's
awesome that's like exactly what they
should have moved into next you know
it's not awesome this segue into
something that's not awesome posted by
dr. McIntosh on the forum the original
article is from qz comm so that could
have been a good segue except I mean did
you just intentionally trashed it
google admits that they'd been
collecting Android users locations even
when location services are disabled oops
what upsy daisy's so they've said that
they didn't use the location data they
collected using this service they never
used or stored it and the company is now
taking steps to end the practice this is
a quote by the end of November Android
phones will no longer send cell tower
location data to Google at least as part
of this particular service which
consumers cannot disable so what was
going on for a while is even if you
disabled location services didn't use
apps and didn't have a SIM card Android
phones would be gathering your location
data based on cell towers and
transmitting it back to Google notices
since the beginning of 2017 so basically
at this point like we're gonna continue
talking about this but at this point
from from the topic that we haven't
talked about yet which is the Oberer
topic where they like leaked an obscene
amount of user data didn't report it for
like a year and paid hackers to cover it
up to nearly as bad as that are you sure
well okay if we believe Google's story
about this then it's not nearly as bad
as that because what they're saying is
in January this year and and it's only
been this year and they're saying that's
only been an entire year they're saying
that we looked into using cell ID codes
as an additional signal to further
improve the speed and performance of
message delivery we never incorporated
into the network sync system so the data
was immediately discarded
okay so like I don't know if I trust
that but sure
so yeah the idea was they were using the
addresses of multiple towers to
triangulate a phone's location something
that they basically what I was saying is
if you want any form of privacy
just don't use electronic devices and
don't know anyone who uses electronic
devices yeah or that are connected to
anything yeah if they're not connected
to anything you're good yeah so why
don't we get into the uber thing yeah oh
my god this is actually kind of trash
uber paid hackers to delete stolen data
on fifty-seven million people I mean at
least they at least they paid the ransom
um this was posted by blue chinchilla
eating Doritos on the forum and the
original article here is from Bloomberg
what garbage whoa
is it just me or has did uber not
position themselves as like the good guy
New Age company that was gonna like be
like guys like all the taxis that into
the garbage can and then threw gasoline
on top of it and then threw like TNT on
top of it and then threw all that into a
furnace and were just like yeah that's
basically what so there's a lot of
people really excited about being able
to tip through her I'm not and you want
to know why because I thought the entire
point of this I thought the entire point
of uber was that we were doing away with
the things that were wrong with the cab
industry and that's that you never know
how much to pay cabbies are jerks if you
are if you don't tip them really well
I've legitimately had my bags thrown on
the ground because I didn't tip enough
and I thought that they were supposed to
pay the drivers adequately such that
that wasn't going to be an issue anymore
and see I didn't think the idea was that
they were gonna like nickel and dime the
drivers to the point where then they go
oh you know what
actually the boatloads of money that
we're making oh you know what we're not
gonna give those seat to the driver
could you top them up actually you you
the passenger like yeah yeah why don't
you top them up let's go let's do it the
way the cabbies did it
are you kidding me and it drives me
kinda nuts because I really liked that
as well I like not having to deal with
that but I would have rather paid more
natively and not had to tip me too
because now I'm in this weird situation
where I know that they're not getting we
don't have over here so I literally only
ran into this once since the tip update
came out yeah it's not cheaper anymore
at all no and you still have to tend you
have to tip and like legitimately feel
like a jerk if you don't tip yeah
because they're not getting paid enough
which is just like a thing uber drivers
are not paid very well so what can you
just charge me more so I don't have to
do that
oh I tipping is actually done
I hate tipping you know I want everyone
to make the right amount of money and I
want to pay you more for things I don't
want to not tip it's the same with the
thing with loot boxes like this is a not
great opinion I wish games costed more
really super unpopular opinion tell me
more I'm shy had popcorn at this yeah
yeah like everyone in the chat is
currently loading firearms attack sure
yeah you're right sometimes haven't gone
up in a long time mm-hmm yeah I think
ass nest game was about 50 bucks
it's they've been pretty similarly
priced for a long time and that was 20
Wow and there's arguments for the other
side like you don't even sell freakin
physical games anymore so it should
probably cost less yeah but there's a
lot of risk involved with making a game
yeah it's also more expensive to make a
game it's also way more expensive way
more to make a game these days indie
Studios are taking huge risk on games
and then are not expected to charge more
than like $20 for a game yeah because a
lot of any games are like 15 25 bucks I
would and to compensate these things and
you can all say whatever the heck you
want you can tell me I'm wrong you can
help me no digital distribution is
cheaper you tell me no there's more
gamers now you tell me no homme there's
there's more mainstream gamers now
meaning that a lot more games to be
purchased in general yeah sure say
whatever you want
they're compensating for the fact that
they're not increasing the price of the
game with
boxes and other weird crappy things like
cosmetic purchasing now with certain
games in my opinion to make sense sure
Liga Legends is free you can buy skins
that's great sounds good how have fun
League of Legends and games like that
that are free games that sell some skins
I don't really care about that with
something like destiny - in destiny - I
paid full price for the game mm-hmm I
have to pay for every freaking little
damn DLC thing that they want to release
for every single little boss in Peach
Luke that they want to keep going and
there's the bright engrams store where
you buy randomized loot boxes that give
you cosmetic items back in the day you
would play the game to get the freaking
cosmetic items and it actually dilutes
from the game this is something that I
don't like we called it questing yeah in
most games that has something like that
you would go on a quest in WoW you would
get the new cool item you could wear it
around town it sounds good
what this actually hurts is it literally
makes it so that there isn't as much to
do in the game right because like
killing the butcher a bunch of none of
the butchers about example because he
always drops the cleaver but yeah
whatever someone else who drops a
special drop like once every 20 times
you want to go there and you want to do
it with your friends you want to get
your friends on to go play it because
you want that item now you can just buy
it that literally takes content out of
the game essentially because you're not
going to do it as much because you don't
care because you could just spend $2 to
buy it and that $2 is probably worth
your time so you might actually do that
cosmetic items and loot boxes are
cancerous literally they are eating away
at games and breaking them down and
diluting them and making them worse
current games are worse systems if
you've ever bought one you're the
problem yeah there you go loot boxes are
essentially tipping I don't like tipping
I don't like loot boxes
I would rather pay more and buy the
whole damn thing and be able to
experience the whole game okay I want to
push harder I want to get all my friends
on I want to fight and push that boss in
freaking what is it called the raid
whatever in destiny too
I did it once - twice one we're already
done what what we cleared it like the
first time I tried it that's ridiculous
what happened to that there's no like
effort that I said go into games anymore
not all games I know but a lot of them
cuphead great game but then there's no I
don't really care about doing it again
there's no like special ship that I can
get from there there's no special
Sparrow that I can get from there
can I pick something sure okay one of
the problems and I understand you're all
gonna hate me it's okay
they don't actually oh one of the
problems that DLC songs or that some
kind of ongoing payment system solves is
the server uptime and the feast or
famine nature of being a game developer
we're not every game can be
counter-strike know I'd still be selling
literally twenty years
yeah after it first comes out and that
is a huge issue something very unpopular
that I'd probably be better off just not
saying it all so yeah what happened was
I accidentally bumped the Machine which
seems to be causing it to blue screen
right now for some reason so it probably
just needs a like take apart reseed
everything put it back together anyway
so I was hanging around with the
monolith guys yeah a couple weeks ago
yeah and what was interesting about this
was that I was hanging around in a game
studio for a game that for our game
studio that just released the game like
a two-year effort game just launched and
there were still lots of people still
employed still with jobs okay now hold
on a second now you can think about this
from the perspective of the the
individual like the the worker okay the
the artist or the programmer or whatever
the case may be obviously people prefer
to have a steady flow of income and
predictable employment with benefits etc
etc etc and you could kind of go well
you know what they knew what they were
signing up for in the game industry
baby baby baby too bad for them okay
step back for a second that may all be
true but what about the company one of
the biggest challenges as a company is
attracting talent attracting and
retaining good talent if you want to
have a chance in a highly competitive
industry like the games industry and you
can see why this evolution is happening
you need to be able to offer employment
packages to people that might include
free lunches or super fancy $1,200
chairs or whatever perks it is that
elsewhere in the industry companies are
offering or you are gonna end up with no
staff the inability to make any game let
alone a good one and you are going to go
out of business so effectively what's
happening is whether you agree or not
whether you like it or not the fact that
this business model works is turning
anyone who doesn't adopt it into
dinosaurs and the problem is not the
workers if they have the option and if
you say that you wouldn't you're either
a liar or you're a unicorn okay if they
have the option to take a job that will
continue and gives them lots of benefits
and that they can rely on getting up in
the morning and going to like you know
think about someone like a composer you
know monolith has a dedicated composer
who does the music for all their games
so what do they really stag a man it's
just like so yeah I guess you better go
find some other music to compose if he
has the option to take the job that's
SIA or the jobs man so wait continues
because he still do he's composing music
for cutscenes and DLCs and all that kind
of stuff but I don't think anyone's
upset with that know what people are
upset about is is the fact that this
this culture of microtransactions exists
and that it's that is making it so that
okay so you're saying they should just
charge more for the game in the first
place but that still wouldn't solve the
problem the feast or famine problem
because no business is gonna forecast
going okay we're gonna charge 130
dollars for our game and then we're just
going to keep everyone on staff and make
no money for that and we'll just pay out
of out of our coffers for like the year
until we're like getting close to the
next release and then it's crunch time
and everyone will just kind of work that
whole time like that's not viable I
think you could have because I think DLC
being planned for because this is
something that seems to trigger people
is DLC being planned for before the
release and it's planned for before the
release because that's the way that you
avoid feast or famine and that's you
provide a steady job and so some people
scream about that yeah oh my god you're
releasing the game you already have a
release date for DLC that's crazy
buh-buh-bah yeah I don't think of that
is hurting thing I don't I'm not a huge
fan of course I would like every single
thing in existence to be in the game
when I buy it right away
sure whatever but I don't think that is
ultimately that terrible what I would
prefer they did was have a steady
schedule of releases so I actually like
the concept of what Destiny's released
idea is which is that DLCs over time I
bought destiny 2 with the amount of
stuff that I've done within destiny 2 I
am happy with my initial purchase of
destiny - I would like more please sir I
will buy your next DLC raid and I will
fight osiris that sounds good that
sounds like a good transaction thank you
very much I knew that was coming I'm
happy to pay for it I'm happy with my
initial purchase I'm sure I will be
happy with the Osiris DLC I am pissed
off about the bright engrams that's a
separate thing entirely and I wish that
I had more to do in the game because of
which the bright engrams weren't there I
would have been happier to pay more for
the DLC that's coming up and I would
have been happy to pay more for the
initial game if the bright and grams
were not in the game all the content and
items that are in the brighter games
were in the game and there was
mechanical processes to get those things
right so I'm totally okay with DLC I
loved the idea one of my favorite things
ever was the battle chess for Warcraft 3
where you get the game in the expansion
and if you went at the beginning and you
bought the base game and then Frozen
Throne comes out and you're like oh my
god it's
good that was awesome it doesn't make as
much sense anymore because while I love
that model and I would prefer that model
it doesn't make as much sense anymore
it's a very difficult thing to pull off
something to that I think we're all
forgetting is how pissed off we were
about that model back when it first
showed up with broodwar I wasn't okay a
lot of people a lot of people were a lot
of people were pissed off that all of a
sudden they had a copy of a game
Starcraft that wasn't compatible with in
multiplayer with all their friends okay
that's that's pretty poo but a lot of a
lot of studios have fixed that you can
have the newer the multiplayer is on its
own layer and then single players on is
only I I do agree with that but there's
been trash at every stage and we've been
mad every time yeah I think this is a
new tier of trash in my opinion probably
I think I'm getting old loot well yeah
that's true and I've thought about that
too though but this is the first time
that it's reduced the content that there
is in a game right okay that is directly
there is actionable reasons why these
cosmetic items because there's there's
no way you're gonna look at a game like
destiny - that is extremely about what
your character looks like and go there
really isn't that many cosmetic options
when you make destiny - you would have
made that game with a lot of cosmetic
quests and weird things maybe an option
for this thing that's kind of tedious
and annoying and most people aren't
gonna do it but then this one dude is
gonna go know what this is gonna be my
thing I'm gonna have the watermelon
colored armor that requires you to kill
these one dudes a whole bunch for
whatever reason and no one else is going
to do it never want to look at me and
think that I'm cool because I did it
that's content that's being able to show
up when you're in your buddies fireteam
and he goes oh wow cool you got that
thing you got the hand of Ragnar O's you
kill drag so many times that you got the
hand of Regnerus
that's amazing that's super it does no
damage but it looks cool not directly
lining up but like there's there's
there's there's no no I know my point is
just like sometimes you go and you get a
unique item just for the sake of having
it not because it's yeah yeah like like
the idea of transmog so I was talking
about this the other day
the idea of transmog drives me crazy to
transmog is the idea of being able to
take an item and make it look like
another
okay that in my opinion dilutes the idea
of the original item yeah and makes it
easier for people to digest the idea of
just paying money to look cool instead
of playing the game to look cool I think
transmog is like the gateway drug of
just paying money for something to look
cool because you can just make things
look like whatever you want and the game
becomes less about actually working and
getting the cool things yeah I don't
know so there's there's there's
situations in games like destiny too and
lots of other games where you can look
at something like the raid or look at
something like another piece of content
and go there should be more here there
should be another objective there should
be a side thing there should be whatever
so that I can get this other item that
should be in this game and probably is
just hidden behind a paid box and it
sucks when that objective that goal that
mission that quest that whatever is no
longer in the game because someone
probably thought about it it might have
even been there on a certain build of
the game and then someone else went hey
that's a cosmetic item we can probably
get away with putting that in the loot
box that makes me sad Elon Musk wanna
bet yeah our original article from ARS
technica he said he would finish the
world's largest battery installation in
a hundred days or it was free it has 100
mega watts capacity a world record and
they finished it on time 100 sorry 100
and 100 mega watt 129 mega watt hour
battery installations a huge capacity
and huge power delivery capability and
it's the largest mega watt rating for
any grid connected battery installation
in the world and one of the snarky
asides in the article is that this may
be the first time that Elon Musk has
ever delivered anything let alone early
so you have to make him bet that's
that's the hope he figured out because
apparently musk said it would have cost
Tesla 50 million dollars or more if the
company failed to meet the deadline so I
guess he was like alright sure let's do
it
that's what cool oh my gosh
Pokemon go Creator raises two hundred
million dollars ahead of a Harry Potter
game launch you're gonna play it DOS I
don't even like don't even pretend to to
be like oh those silly people who are
gonna play a Harry Potter game shut up I
to be fair I did drop off of Pokemon go
pretty quick yeah but that's not what I
said I said you're gonna play this the
biggest thing that annoys me about ya
Niantic neon tech whatever everyone cone
is that everything seems so half-assed
like I used to play yeah what was it
called ingress yeah yeah I used to play
ingress a lot back when like not that
many people played ingress I even played
ingress win the game hadn't released in
South Korea and I played Harry Potter
there's only people playing it or
traveling Potter was cool you're like an
Etzel and I go hipster that's sad
excellent I had control of like most of
Seoul it was it was pretty freakin cool
but I remember even playing that game I
was like wow this is really you know I'm
really just clicking the button and
tapping it a bunch and nothing else
really happens it's it's all super
randomized there's really not a lot of
substance to this game really cool
concept oh so I'm going to keep trying
hopefully they update it and hopefully
it's cool and then Pokemon go came out
it was like wow they really just skimmed
the previous game there's really not a
lot going people apparently don't
believe we're live because the time on
the computer is wrong Oh
that's the right time wait what yeah
they're just drunk a lot of people don't
understand that Canada is really big
it's dry yeah I got a question all the
time what time is it in Canada I'm just
like oh man that's not a thing cuz you
know what you know what not making
matters we should we should just do it
we should have a Canada times
Google is not helping okay because if
you Google what time is it in can my god
you actually see this is the problem
Canada is they really do think they are
the only Canada yeah um so just like I'm
surprised it's not Toronto though but
yeah they're just what time is it so
that's our capital that's what time it
is in our capital in not our capital it
is literally three hours earlier yeah
and then if you go further east
it gets literally an hour and a half
later yes that's right we have four and
a half times and that is without some
island in the middle of the Pacific
America yeah we don't even need that to
have four-and-a-half time zones okay
yeah I'm gonna have in the States for I
think I'm not in time no I think Eastern
is as Eastern as it goes
yeah Pacific to Eastern alright cuz we
have what they have this here called
does Alaska reach out into another one
I'm not sure it might yeah
oh there's anyone count Alaska I do free
shipping on something it's lower 48 I
mean they only count the lower 48 so why
am I expected to keep which is I I know
people from Alaska that are great people
I know people from Alaska that are gonna
heal me when classic Wow comes out so I
have to be nice to them lordy alright so
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
you again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel what are we gonna do about
this we're gonna slice them together
here somehow oh dear
oscar has its own time zone
I still don't count it I do know Alaska
should be part of Canada I agree we
screwed that up free back
