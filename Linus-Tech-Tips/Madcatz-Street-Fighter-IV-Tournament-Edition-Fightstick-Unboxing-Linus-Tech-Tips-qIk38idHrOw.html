Mad Catz Street Fighter 4 collector's
edition tournament Edition arcade fight
stick so this is a heck of a box that it
comes in you get an official Street
Fighter 4 tournament Edition fight stick
like certificate thing here we want to
thank you for purchasing it all that
kind of noise and then you've gotten let
a little window here into the box so
we're gonna start breaking these seals
and we'll get this baby out so we've got
the Xbox 360 version of the fight stick
with us today but it is available in
both Xbox 360 and ps3 versions so this
will fold up this is a great box I
really like it's and you've got your
Street Fighter 4 logo here forget the
box opens up accessories now I have to
confess I'm not much of a Street Fighter
junkie so I won't really know too much
about it but it looks like this is an
adapter cable for using a console
headset so it comes with that right out
of the box that's kind of nice to see
those thoughtful accessories included
for us so I'm gonna happen wow this is a
huge box and this thing is actually
quite heavy so I'm gonna have to there
we go pull this out let's put the Box
aside for a second here get the packing
materials in there you can see the whole
box is like a glossy black it's kind of
nice ok so let's start at the back of
the fight stick so we've got our start
and back buttons up on the shoulder here
and then inside you've got your USB
cable so that's what you'll use to
connect it to your Xbox 360 it's stored
in a nice little reusable compartment
you run the wire through that hole right
there
let's go around to the side so glossy
white finish on the sides and then just
a matte black finish here and here's the
headphone jack that we can use to plug
in our headphones yeah that's good stuff
ok so then on the other side again a
glossy white finish and I'm gonna flip
it over to the back where you can see
that we've got little rubberized feet so
you can use those to make sure that your
fight stick isn't gonna move around
during your frantic gaming action
okay so up on the top here's where the
meat and potatoes of this particular
thing is going to happen now as I said I
confess I'm not a huge Xbox owner or
Street Fighter owner but we've got a
turbo button here LS DP and rs button
here you can lock or unlock something
about it and this seems to be some kind
of Xbox button so then basically you've
got your joystick which feels quite good
actually it seems like you can easily
move it around without feeling like it's
cheaply made or anything like that I
really like the overall quality of the
surface here you can kind of pound on
this thing and it doesn't have that
cheap feel that a lot of game
controllers do so anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing on the street
fighter for joystick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
