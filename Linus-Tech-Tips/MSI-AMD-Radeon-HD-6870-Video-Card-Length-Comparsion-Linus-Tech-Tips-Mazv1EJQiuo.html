fact that i'm holding a measuring tape
we are going to be doing a length
comparison with the new 6870 against a
couple of the last generation high-end
cards with which it will either compete
or replace on the market so let's have a
look let's start with the 6870 so we're
measuring right from the back of the pc
i bet bracket and because camera man's
measuring tape is inconveniently in
inches we're going to have to go ahead
and give the results in inches so if you
want to come to have a look over here
right here from the top cameraman this
is a nine and just a little bit over
three quarters of an inch so it's like
nine and seven eighths of an inch long
and remember it makes a difference
whether the pci express power connectors
are on the back of the car to the top
because if you got a card that's uh nine
and seven eighths of an inch long but it
has a PCI Express connector hanging out
the back of it that means you got to
account for that plug so this one is
going to fit as long as you have nine
and seven eighths inches in your case so
next up we have nvidia zeeeee ruler of
the roost and this one is ten and a half
inches so the new 6870 which i don't
actually know the performance of yet
will compare at least in length quite
favorably to the gtx 480 480 gtx edges
and then AMD's 5870 is 11 inches long so
the 6870 is a little bit shorter than
its previous generation similarly named
cousins so thank you for checking out my
length comparison with the 6870 against
the gtx 480 as well as the HD 5870</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
