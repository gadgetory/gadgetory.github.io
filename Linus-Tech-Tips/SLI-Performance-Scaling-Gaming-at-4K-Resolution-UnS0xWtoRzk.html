than one graphics card at a time for a
richer gaming experience with higher
frame rates and more in-game eye candy
turned on you can learn more about it in
this video here on tech wiki now
Nvidia's website is full of certain
information about SLI technology which
graphics cards support it where to buy
the other hardware you need guides on
how to set it up but I noticed that
beyond one specific two-way SLI
configuration at one specific resolution
they don't seem to even want to talk
about the value proposition of adding in
more cards or how performance scales in
relation to the cost as you put more and
more graphics cards in your gaming PC so
when a unique opportunity fell into my
lap to test two-way three-way and
four-way SLI with the brand-spanking-new
GTX 980 at 4k I jumped on it corsair
gaming RGB keyboards feature precision
Cherry MX RGB key switches for sixteen
point eight million color / key
backlighting for virtually unlimited
customization click now to learn more
I'm going to jump right into numbers
here because they actually only tell
part of the story I tested for games
with details cranked at 4k resolution on
a gigabyte x99 gaming 5 with the core i7
4930 k6 core at 4 gigahertz and 16 gigs
of 24 hundred megahertz ddr4 memory and
then I threw a courser ax 1500 eye power
supply on the bench because I was
concerned about power consumption and
overwhelming the existing one but more
on that later so let's start with what
should be the poster child for multi Way
SLI
Tomb Raider 2013 if all you do is hang
around and play tomb raider go buy 4 gtx
980 s hell buy an extra one to keep on
your desk to remind you of how great it
is you get 30 FPS average with one card
then 23 to 24 more frames per second
with each additional card almost the
same scale and going from 1 to 2 2 to 3
and 3 to 4 cards and on top of that the
animations are butter smooth with no
perceptible micro
Studdard outstanding it's just too bad
not every game is like this if
tomb-raiders the poster child watchdogs
is the one in the corner with a dunce
hat scaling from one GPU to two seems ok
at first glance if we only look at
average frame rates but minimum frame
rates tell a bit more of the story they
dropped almost in half and this hitching
and stuttering was very noticeable
in-game it actually gets worse the more
graphics cards you add yet another issue
for the PC version of watchdogs next up
is Far Cry 3 something unusual you might
notice about this game is that the
minimum frame rates are very close to
the average frame rates in some cases
this is because our run for this game
involves driving around a track running
over dudes and getting shot at and looks
very consistent having minimum and
average frame rates close to each other
makes animations appear very smooth on
screen at least with one or two GPUs
installed in the system even though
average frame rate scale very well with
more GPUs you can see that minimums
don't and this manifests as uneven
inconsistent movement of objects on
screen with three or four graphics cards
our last game is Crysis 3 just like Far
Cry 3 it scaled well from 1 to 2 GPUs
but we see the same issue with great
average framerate scaling and poor
minimum framerate scaling that
translates to uneven lurchy animations
in the case of Crysis 3 it was actually
noticeably worse than Far Cry 3 with
three-way and four-way SLI so much so
that as a gamer I would much rather play
with two graphics cards at lower detail
settings than with more graphics cards
and game settings cranked
speaking of in-game settings if you want
to see how I was running everything
check out the download link in the video
description GPU boost clock speed was
another interesting part of the story
with two GPUs we saw slightly lower
turbo speeds because we hit our thermal
limit sooner on the top card than the
bottom one because it has less access to
fresh air surprisingly though we reached
the same GPU speed even in the other
configurations pretty impressive when
they're all packed in like sardines in a
4 Way config speaking of impressive
power consumption I mean I mentioned
before
I threw a 1500 watt 80 plus titanium PSU
in this rig to ensure that I wouldn't be
limited the fan on it barely even turned
on our 4 Way SLI configuration drew 620
watts from the wall in our stare at the
fire test in Far Cry 3 that means that
even accounting for another 50% capacity
for future expansion a thousand watt
power supply would have been plenty for
this rig so it's back on the bench
alright now back up a second line is you
run in here throw a bunch of graphs in
our faces for five minutes and then
basically voice over telling us to
ignore the performance numbers because
they don't reflect the gameplay
experience what gives great question
normally when we do benchmarks on this
channel it's okay to use fraps to take
average frame rates and compare graphics
cards relative performance because in be
our game show downs and our graphics
card reviews we only test single GPU
configurations with multi-gpu
configurations particularly beyond 2-way
as I've been discussing in this video
different measurements need to be taken
to evaluate the evenness of the pace
with which new frames are delivered to
the gamer here's an example the video
you're watching right now is playing at
30 frames per second smooth look hold on
a second what was that we only dropped
the frame rate three percent to 29
frames per second but because you're
doing this by dramatically increasing
the delivery time of just a few frames
periodically you're seeing very
noticeable hitches and stutters aren't
you that's what I'm talking about
now unfortunately we don't have the
equipment to objectively measure the
perceived smoothness of a game like
you'll see on some of the hardcore tech
sites like PC / and tech report I
recommend reading up on those sites by
the way a search for frame pacing if you
want to learn more about this but the
good news is that in the case of our
multi Way SLI video today at least with
this new and relatively immature driver
for the GTX 980 it was easy to pick up
on the stuff with the naked eye so being
able to measure it wouldn't have changed
the conclusion much and here it is what
we've been saying for years is still
true one of the fastest GPU you can
afford is best in
those cases because you'll always get
the performance you paid for even in
watchdogs until you get up to the top
tier cards at which point two of them
might make sense if you really are
hungry for more performance but beyond
that things really come off the rails in
a hurry and I guess I can see why NVIDIA
offers users the capability to run more
cards if they want to but didn't even
have any three-way or four-way configs
running even in their own demo systems
at the GTX 980 launch event so I'm
pretty much wraps it up guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
just liked it leave a comment letting me
know if your feelings are more
complicated than this check the link in
the video description if you want to
support us you can give us a monthly
contribution buy a cool t-shirt oh I'm
not wearing one of our t-shirts today
well that's awkward
buy a cool Linus tech tips t-shirt like
oh why thank you like this one yeah I'm
standing on a box he tripped on it and
also I changed your link to Amazon to
one with our affiliate code so we get a
small kickback whenever you buy I don't
know licorice or whatever is you buy on
Amazon thanks for watching guys and as
