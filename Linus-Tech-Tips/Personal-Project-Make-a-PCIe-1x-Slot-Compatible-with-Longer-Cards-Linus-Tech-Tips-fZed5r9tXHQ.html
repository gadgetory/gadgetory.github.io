server storage upgrade is that I'm going
to be adding a remotely located server
however I've run into well it's just a
minor hiccup but I thought it'd be an
interesting tip so I need to take this
LSI 92 48 I raid card and I need to
quickly copy all of the essential data
that I'm going to be doing nightly
synchronizations
from this array the the 8 by 3 terabyte
array from my Windows Home Server so I
don't want to do that first sync over
the Internet so what I want to do is I
want to install that other raid card in
here and then install the other drives
in here so that I can do a do a quick
copy so the challenge is that this
motherboard only has two PCIe 16x slots
however based on some quick math PCIe 1x
2.0 is good for 5.0 gigabit per second
which is plenty for this PCIe 4x
ethernet card so what I really want to
do is install the 4x card in that 1 X
slot so if you guys know about PCIe
you'll know that the first pins here
these guys right here that's all your
power and whatnot and then everything
from here on is data so the only thing
that makes this a 1x lot and this a 16x
slot is how many pins it has for
bandwidth so some other board
manufacturers are considered enough to
leave these edges open here so that you
can install 4x or 16 X cards in a 1x
slot and they will work however my Intel
Board in my home server doesn't have the
ending open like that so to give myself
the option of installing higher end
cards in there what I have to do is and
I'm hold on give me SEC guys so I've had
a few promising ideas
guys I got to keep my voice down baby
sleeping but it looks like none of them
are going to be applicable to those say
the system that's installed already the
motherboard that's in the case so idea
number one was melting so I used my
torch to keep off the tip of this blade
and then slice through the back of it so
that it would accommodate a bigger card
now the problem with melting is that I
had issues with some of the melted
material moving this way towards the
pins that's going to be a real big
problem because you don't want to lose
any pins from a PCIe 1x interface so I
scrapped that idea next idea was seeing
if I could cut through the plastic with
a razor blade and slice it
either side the problem with that one
was that it required far too much force
and if you slip with a razor blade you
cut a bunch of traces and gonna be bad
all around an idea number three was to
use a dremel use a cutting wheel on a
dremel to grind through the back this
one looks like it's probably going to
work but unfortunately with the other
motherboard which is stalled in a case
with things in the way you can see I
can't get the Dremel in the street and I
don't have one of those extension bits
so uh I'm stuck for now but thanks for
coming along with me for the ride guys
so I decided to pull the board out and
we're just gonna go for it um I haven't
actually tested it successfully on my
test board yet we're just going to use
the Dremel and file out that back piece
and see if we could install this PCIe 4x
NIC card into the PCIe 1x lot more right
now it's yeah won't fit so it'll run at
1x speed but pcie 2.0 1x and this is a
2.0 card isn't 5 gave it per second so
we should be ok alright so I did one run
at it with the Dremel and cleared all
the debris out hopefully you guys can
see this but it's mostly clear one of
the pins that top-right one seems to
have broken in half while I was Dremel
about it looks like it should still make
contact so it should still be able to
pass data and it should be ok all this
is in theory of course I don't recommend
doing this
home folks so I do have to take another
pass at it because it's not quite clear
I wish that my Dremel could run in
Reverse because then instead of throwing
all the gunk into the slot it could
throw it out but such as life so I'm
going to take another run at it and I'll
see if I can fit the card in actually
the card fits in now so let's just find
out if it works
here we go thrown it back on the server
lo and behold it works there's my four
gigabit network adapters
there's my network adapter installed in
the bottom PCIe 1x slot and there's the
network cables all plugged in so I've
got my Adaptec raid card here for
testing my Rika raid card that my actual
storage runs off of and then my 4 port
NIC all installed yay and all hopefully
with enough bandwidth for what I'm using
them for don't forget to subscribe -
tech tips on also don't forget to wear
appropriate safety glasses whenever
working with a dremel
I could hit the switch I could in this
