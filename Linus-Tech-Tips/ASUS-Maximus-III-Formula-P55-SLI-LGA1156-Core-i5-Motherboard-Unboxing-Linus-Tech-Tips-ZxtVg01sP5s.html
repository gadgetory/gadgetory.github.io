Maximus 3 formula so this is a Seuss's
premium P 55 LGA 1156 board you can see
from the logos on the front it supports
nvidia sli and ATI crossfire X
technology so this is a Republic of
gamers board which means you've got all
of us oozes high-end features so you got
a black red and white color scheme for
the board we're gonna get that out in a
minute here but let's talk about a
couple of the basic features that you
will find on it so it also features
something that's new for there p55
boards there mem ok technology which
basically allows you to press a button
and make sure that your motherboard is
gonna select the most compatible
possible settings for your memory to
ensure that you can post even with more
exotic Ram so that's kind of a cool
feature well let's take out the matte
black box here that has all of the
accessories and there are a lot of
accessories so here we've got Q Connect
which allows you to plug in all your
individual little pins and then plug
into the board as an entire brick then
we've got what appears to be an sli
bridge that's a very short SLI bridge
actually the spacing must be a little
bit on the different side here some zip
ties then we've got the user guide
including oh this is this is interesting
so there's your your drivers and your
driver DVD and then here so this is for
labeling all of your SATA connectors
I've actually never seen this included
in in a motherboard box before so you
can label all of the the SATA connectors
that go to all of your different drives
that's that's very unique that's very
helpful for managing your cables and
this is a stick oh this is a republic of
gamers that sticker for the side of your
of your case that's very cool as well
here we have a USB cable
and then we have the IO shield right
there
then we've got a whole lot of SATA
cables so we got one two three four five
six SATA cables and then on the back
panel we've got two USB and one eSATA IO
plate and last but not least we've got
the supreme FX X Phi PCIe 1x audio board
so that will install in the top slot so
we're all done with the accessories so
let's get into the board itself here as
I mentioned before this is a premium
board from a soos so it will have almost
all if not all of the high-end bells and
whistles sorts of features so let's get
it kind of in a more comfortable place
here so we can have a look at it here
all right
so let's start with the basic layout
here's our two PCIe 16x slots so like
almost all p55 boards they're gonna run
at 8 X 8 X if you're running SLI or
crossfire so you can see you've actually
got another PCIe 16x slot that one will
run at 4x now in terms of SATA ports
you've got a ton of SATA ports on this
board you've got two here that are
labeled for optical drives you've got
two here that are labeled for hard
drives and then you've got another six
these are the ones you're gonna want to
use first because these are the ones
coming off the actual chip side of the
board the Intel chipset so those can be
used for anything then for power
connectors we've got the power
connectors in their usual locations with
the 24 pin on the right and then the 8
pin over at the top left now in terms of
the power design for the CPU you can see
you can count on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 this is probably a 16
plus three-phase power design based on
checking out how many phases there are
so the three phases are actually for the
uncor of the CPU now one thing I noticed
right away about this board is that all
of the fan headers and the cameraman is
having a look at the at the cool glowing
logo on the Northbridge that's pretty
sweet actually I really like the the
fashionable sort of color choices
they've gone with for this board it's a
far cry better than what we've seen in
the past from everyone actually but what
you can see here this is kind of a
high-end features that you've got all
4-pin pwm readies fan headers so there
are one two three four five six seven
eight of them on this board all over the
place that's a really cool thing to see
like all p55 boards you got support for
dual channel ddr3 memory and let's have
a look at what's available on the back
so here we go we've got one two three
four five six seven nine USB ports one
ps2 keyboard port a CMOS reset button
then we've got firewire eSATA one
Gigabit Ethernet port and then we have
the azouz what is this thing even called
actually it's called
ROG connect so you've got a port for
that feature as well this button will
turn that on so anyway thank you for
checking out my blog on the Maximus 3
