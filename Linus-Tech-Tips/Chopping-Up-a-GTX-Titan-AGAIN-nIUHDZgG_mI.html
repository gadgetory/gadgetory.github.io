little while back where we chopped up a
GTX Titan so it could fit in a single
PCI Express slot with a card installed
right next to it that mod included water
cooling no and we thought why don't we
try and do one better what if we made a
single slot card that's air-cooled Alex
why don't you quit your bitching and get
to work
so get your angle grinders revving
because the GTX Titan is going on the
chopping block once again
experience MSI's GS 63 VR laptop now
with nvidia geforce gtx 1070 max-q check
it out at the link below
making a double slot card the height of
a single slot card with air cooling
isn't particularly easy if it was then
this would be a lot more common than
this this video has been a long time in
the making so we got to work measuring
every important bit of the Titan to make
a SolidWorks model which will actually
link if you guys want to make your own
mod to one of these for whatever reason
with the model for the single slot
adapter made it was time to print now
PLA filament would pass the glass
transition temperature when the Titan
was stressed turning into a deformed
blob so we ended up using ABS with the
3d printed part in hand well one thing
became clear and that's that our
calipers pulled a zero like a drunk hits
a bull's eye but all the critical
dimensions were close enough so we just
needed to perform a little bit of
massaging to get everything to up kind
of fit together for our next trick then
we'll need a low profile fan thanks
cooler guys you have everything now we
were hoping to cannibalize the fan and
mount it where the original fan went but
unfortunately this press fit bearing
holder prevented us from doing so so it
was time for super cannibalization with
this angle grinder and the savagery
continues the wonderful cooler mounting
plate for the Titan well I'm afraid that
anything that was going to be too high
to fit in a single slot was going to
have to go excellent so everything seems
to be coming together fairly well let's
move on then to the final step which
Brendon dubbed torture porn for nerds
chopping up the heatsink originally we
thought that just the good ol angle
grinder would do the trick
allowing us to relatively easily
slice through these thin fins
unfortunately that ended up taking too
long and grinding aluminum is actually
really sketchy so we moved on to our
favorite method of heatsink chopping the
reciprocating saw and oh oh oh no oh
please stop all of humanity Oh huh like
we said before using an angle grinder or
a reciprocating saw those would be
terrible ideas so we ran out and bought
a belt sander to ensure that we didn't
cause any more unnecessary harm to the
heatsink while we cut down its size it
really is amazing how much easier things
are when you have the right tool for the
job with the heatsink now at the right
height we just had to remove any loose
bits of aluminum because if one of those
crosses the traces on the PCB it's game
over and then slap it all together it's
actually a little bit easier to assemble
now than stock since there are way less
screws so that's a plus the fan mounts
with some strong double-sided tape the
see-through panel had to be glued onto
the outside instead of the inside like
on the original model but I mean this
was so that we could maximize the area
of the fins because in truth having the
glass on the inside would have meant
about 20% less cooling unfortunately
though when we went to test it the fan
wouldn't work possibly because of the
grinding we could have got another fan
but if we're being honest that just
wasn't going to be enough airflow anyway
so we went back to the drawing board and
designed a 140 millimeter fan to dryer
vent adapter and a new single slot cover
inspired by server GPUs without awful
for the fan the good people at my mini
factory printed that up for us the parts
arrived and we could finally smash them
into the computer as hard as you guys
are smashing the like button right now
so we bolted the adapter to a knock to a
140 millimeter industrial fan at max
speed and then squeezed it into the case
before connecting the dryer event to the
graphics card we added some foam to the
back to prevent the
dryer vent from shorting anything out we
then attach the vent the red green way
lots of duct tape and finished it off
with some duct tape for that industrial
quality seal now it just needs to be
encouraged in and we're good to go oh my
god what is that Wow this actually looks
like shockingly not I mean the Vics
light is sort of unnecessary by that
does this work where did it exhaust from
okay that seems to be a bit of a design
flaw there yeah did you not think to
maybe cut vents here like single slot
graphics card is usually do okay okay
okay okay
oh boy oh boy oh buddy
oh boy you better shut this baby down
before you overheat here and while we
could have spent the rest of the day
taking it all apart modifying it
carefully and putting it back together
it was easier to whip out the saw and
hack off the last inch of the cover to
give it some breathing room which hardly
help - no of course it thermal throttled
again because our heatsink was crazy
restrictive and getting almost no
airflow also this whole thing was kind
of a dumb idea Alex did the calculations
before he even started the project and
no matter how much air you push across
the fins if they're that size you're not
going to get the cooling needed for a
Titan so I guess the real takeaway from
today's video is that math exists for a
reason yeah some of us already knew that
ring-ring who's there nobody this is
just my hand but if I was using a real
phone and I was calling ting the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
satisfaction I would be talking to a
real person no robots no automated phone
tree no nothing because they actually
care and what's crazy about that
if you don't pay extra ting users pay
only for the voice and
that they actually use with the average
bill being only 23 bucks a month per
device and if you're stuck in a contract
they'll even cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 I mean that
could be three months of your sole
service they even have lower mobile data
rates than ever before with data now
just $10 a gig beyond the first gig so
head over to Linus King comm we've got
that linked in the video description and
try out their savings calculator it'll
tell you based on your last few bills
and your usage whether you'll save money
on ting then when you sign up at our
link you'll also get 25 bucks in service
credit or towards a new device so thanks
