sounds too good to be true doesn't it I
mean that's really cheap for a
performance metric that has been held in
this nigh impossible space for so long
this card being able to stand up to this
feat would be wonderful and could be a
great boon for the market adoption as a
whole of VR so the question is can it
perform in VR and if so how well
the Vitesse Mouse from Phoenix features
a lightweight design and an Avago 3310
optical sensor check it out to get a
chance to win one at the link in the
video description before we get into how
the RX 40 itself feels let's talk a bit
about why VR benchmarking is so
difficult unlike traditional 3d games VR
games have to live within a specific set
of parameters to avoid causing serious
issues such as motion sickness for the
user to accomplish this VR applications
always have vertical refresh sink or
vsync on and the current headsets are
capped at 90 Hertz meaning that results
of higher frame rates shown by
traditional benchmarking tools like
fraps aren't always necessarily
representative of an increased user
experience as you may or may not know
most in-game settings for VR experiences
are variable to accommodate for the
necessary 90 Hertz frame rate and avoid
issues like motion sickness this is why
we can't provide traditional benchmark
results like 72 frames per second on
ultra settings part of your run may be
at Ultra but certain settings may also
drop too high or even medium at some
points in order to maintain your frame
rate this is a good thing I'm not
complaining but it does have a side
effect of more complicated benchmarking
procedures there are some ideas about
what we can use to test VR applications
like motion to photon latency frame
times missed frames CPU and GPU time
used in each frame and specific
components like response latency of
specific head mounted displays but
current programs don't have the proper
capabilities needed to measure these
stats well Luke I know how you can bench
VR score based benchmarks
why yes keen viewer score based
benchmarks for VR do seem like the cat's
frickin pajamas and they are coming
future marks VR mark which is based on
DirectX 11 and measures display latency
and persistence via external hardware is
apparently coming soon
whatever soon means
and Basemark VR score which is being
made in cooperation with Crytek supports
both the X 12 and D X 11 and features
multiple test types including
interactive via our static VR and VR
spatial audio it's sort of available but
still needs to be validated by a large
sample set from a number of reviewers
and the community the inherent problem
with synthetic benchmarks is they are
not real-world performance metrics we
need to see how relatable these results
are to the actual experience of using
various setups and make sure the scale
actually works properly however some of
the massive advantages to score based
benchmarks like the ones listed above
are that since they're automated they
are very easily repeatable they may
become widely used and cited thus
becoming a great resource
overall collectively for prospective VR
headset buyers so if you're concerned
about system compatibility you can
actually see how your system may perform
before buying a headset the only
additional problem I see here is when
new harder to run games come out
hopefully gaming companies will be good
about review copies and let reviewers
see what hardware people will need for
various experience levels before the
release of the game with all that said
how did the our X 480 fare actually
quite well especially for a $200 card
now I can't check myself how the
settings changed and stuff throughout
the games but watching John play raw
data it was fine he didn't notice any
big problems and everything was ok now
we have seen certain things from sites
like PC perspective where they put
cameras inside and you can see the frame
timings and stuff isn't as good on cards
that aren't as powerful so we will see
how it fares once VR benchmarks come out
but if you want to just be able to game
in VR the RX 480 can get either men and
for 200 bucks that's pretty sweet
they pass to this test now when AMD was
launching the RX 4 80 they had a little
meeting with a bunch of the reviewers
talking about how benchmarking VR wasn't
really a thing yet and I hope to have a
meeting with Nvidia relatively soon
to talk to them about the situation soon
so hopefully soon enough I'll be able to
give real performance metric based VR
benchmarking result information but
right now it's just a she did pretty
good it's good enough style review so
hopefully that's good enough for you

you're interested in checking out in our
X 480 also check out the link to the
description to buy a shirt that's cool
and talked on the forum about what you
think about VR benchmarking check out
this video if you want to see the actual
review of the rx 480 and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
