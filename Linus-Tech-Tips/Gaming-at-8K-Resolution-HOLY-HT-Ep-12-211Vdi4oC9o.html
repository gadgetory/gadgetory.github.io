to gtx titan an entire arm load of gtx
titan errs on this the 12th installment
of holy shit we're gonna find out if i
drop all these Titans who know i won't
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description okay so first things
first the answer is not any of these
things because these are all old tight
nexus they're like gross and ancient and
like I mean look at it this is an
original Titan ya know the answer is
going to be nvidia x' latest flagship
titan x peas based on the pascal
architecture now i've heard of people
jury-rigging them to run more than two
at a time but for the time being we only
have two and that's all that's
officially supported and that's all we
have SLI bridges for anyhow so the
answer is going to be two of the latest
Titan XPS along with one of their fancy
new high bandwidth bridges which looks a
little something like that is how you
install it right like that it's a Nikki
V SLI bridge installation chip boom oh I
almost dropped that sorry let's put that
right there did you get did you get that
catch oh that's a shame that was awesome
I'm over it now okay that's fine okay so
the next thing we're going to need of
course is an 8k display of some sort and
the astute among you are probably
already aware that unless I could get a
company to send me some kind of amazing
pre-production prototype or something
well those don't really exist yet so
instead I'm going to be tackling this in
a way that I think will give us the
performance results that that we're
looking for without having to source a
product that straight-up isn't available
so this my friends is the monitor desk
mount here we go
let's get all the pieces out here made
by vivo this is a 2 by 2 quad monitor
mount that can accept up to four 27-inch
monitors and we will be using four of
our 27 inch 4k LG displays that are left
over from eight game
one CPU so it's actually this one only I
will need a bunch of them ok well I've
never done one of these before so
consult the manual okay oh my god this
is not going to be easy to assemble I
get it now
ok ok so it is fairly obvious from
looking at this that I am going to need
to make some more room kind of like that
actually that's uh that does seem like
it's gonna work pretty well
ok ah now it's not going anywhere
ok let's get some more monitors wow this
is actually pretty fast to mount my -
look at this
I thought basically building the multi
monitor standing is going to be like
half the video
more time to actually use it than but
why did I take them out again
I didn't Oh what am i doing okay app
doesn't even let me near expensive
hardware not sure
look Oh kick not bad at all okay where's
my test bench GTX 1080 which please we
are getting that garbage off of here
okay this is more like it
um when it goes in what the hell who
bent this oops it's fine just very
expensive graphics card no big deal okay
are they beauties or are they beasts
maybe that was the moral of the story
all along you can be both beauty and
beast if your $1200 graphics card okay
so our quad monitor quad 4k monitor
effectively 8k worth of pixels setup is
now complete so the next step is to hook
up our testbench here we go to the
monitors and see if she fires up the
first time which would be a freaking
Christmas miracle because nothing ever
works the first time especially when
you're working with some kind of bizarro
land experimental setup our testbench
machine we hope is suitably badass it's
got a core i7 59 60 X 8 Core Extreme
Edition 128 gigs of Dominator platinum
Corsair memory and a soos x99 deluxe 2
motherboard a 1600 watt power supply
because you know Yolo whatever right and
even then I'm still pretty skeptical as
to whether it is going to successfully
run games at 8k resolution waiting for a
computer to post is like torture I'm not
sure if it's going to work
oh I don't know if that's a good sign
this could just sign in any time now
hey there we go okay keeps kind of
bailing on me here okay there we go
uh-huh uh-huh
okay there we go oh so crying a lot
hey there we go no are we get this time
no no or not how long until it isn't
funny anymore
ah that's still funny that's good it's
good that it's still funny Oh
got it we good now thank you
geez wow this is something else we could
have a problem here it didn't even occur
to me for a second that I can't tile the
displays in a two by two oh here we go
here we go here we go two by two sure
okay I was having like a panic attack
there okay okay it's confused it's a
little confused it's still figuring out
its confusion it hurt itself in its
confusion oh this is terrible why is
this so hard
why is it saying 1920 by 1080 is my only
yet disabled yeah I want to disable it
piece of junk
so I think I made a small configuration
error you'll have to forgive me it's
been a very long time since I've set up
an Nvidia surround setup but it looks
like the way it works these days is you
don't want to plug all of the displays
into the top graphics card and run SLI
it looks like you actually split up
which graphics card the displays are
plugged into so hopefully that is going
to fix this for me and I will not
continue to have trouble here and that
means that I can run all them on
DisplayPort in theory these are HDMI 2.0
compliant both of them but in practice I
was not able to run at 4k 60 Hertz on
one of my displays so not sure exactly
what any of this means yet but stay
tuned it is not even letting me click on
the Nvidia control and it crashed nope
nevermind it's back and it crashed and
it's back
okay it's bad with Surround oh come on
okay configure that looks right wait
what no that looks right
76 80 by 4320 60 Hertz
come on boa I got it wrong oh shoot
might be easier to just swap the cables
on these ones at this point come on baby
okay I think we're good okay so the
Nvidia control panel crashed just trying
to create this monster but there it is
76 80 by 43 20 and if we pop into our
adapter properties boom
60 Hertz this is 8k yes this is 8k my
friends let's just put that old Nvidia
control panel Yeller here is uh got to
put her down there take her behind the
barn there you go you're done so this is
a first for me let's fire up a game but
can it my friends can it run crisis
running at 1080p
that's 1080 that's full HD that's a joke
so this is a common question that people
will ask is do games even support 4k
well games are actually coated to
support whatever resolutions the system
supports so yes games support 4k without
any additional modifications required in
some cases in the cases of poorly coded
games no they might not support future
resolutions but in theory crisis is
going to fire up in a moment here at 8k
oh oh yes yes there it is
and for some reason afterburner is
showing through but hopefully that will
go away when we minimize it there it is
there it is my friends
8k crisis running at 60 fps in the menu
only mind you but here we go ah I could
get used to this
let's see what kind of performance we
can get out of to Titan XPS Crysis 3
very high and do we crushed it yes my
friends 24 fps fully cinematic in Crysis
3 I may need to turn on bezel
compensation if I'm going to play for
any kind of extended period of time
ok I'm also gonna adjust some in-game
settings here what do you think
is that gonna be playable Hey
whoa ok medium systems back we're
looking at about 50 fps I am liking that
I'm not Oh hold on from the benchmark
okay we're running the benchmark
benchmarking Crysis 3 at a K medium
settings it's great I love this built-in
crosshair into my display here you just
aim it the thing you can't see right
oh that's funny crosshairs a little to
the left ok well that'll be that'll be
trippy as all hell wow this is a
gigantic display and wow it looks
perfect
oh yeah that bezel oh yeah Oh delicious
having that right in the middle like
that yeah just get in my way
perfect I mean I'm not saying this is an
ideal gaming experience I'm just I'm
saying we're gaming at 8k that's all so
if we had like a multi cable 8k display
today
this is how crisis would run on a couple
of Titan XPS benchmarks done ok let's
find out
54 FPS average medium settings no
anti-aliasing I would make the argument
aunty a listen completely unnecessary
ok so grand theft auto
sort of a lesser degree of success here
it looks like yeah GTA 5 was super
unhappy about our 8k resolution yep
okay people try some other games I can
read it I can read this one - yeah the
town folks were something on Monday the
16th Road about 50 miles - brother
Wow yeah brother BAM County something
something circuit weed
something is at night I had some
spending wherever shall call upon the
name of the something saved probably the
Lord yeah you really got to move your
head all right let's run the benchmark I
gotta say this does look like look at
the hair this truly is the future of
gaming 8k gaming friends so do we not
have an 8k monitor
no one has an 8k monitor what about that
television now that's not 8k that's 4k
each I have nothing that's 8k no one has
anything that's 18 that's not true yes
it's a whole bunch of them at NAB well
yes but that's you see I know one those
aren't commercial products you said no
one is killing me here
you said no one okay very literal yes
you do 20 point oh nine frames per
second at medium settings in the Tomb
Raider benchmark that's not great well
no but we'll Counter Strike global
Offensive run is is Ed still here we
should get him to play oh my god but the
console looks ridiculous really Valve's
high DPI scaling is terrible
like it's so inconsistent I'm using the
crosshairs the what is the butt hole in
the middle air
I got what the frame rate is not that
accurate actually you know what it seems
to be it seems to be settling in a
little bit though yet I did sing 60 or
70 but it doesn't feel like it
it was dipping more before and this is
interesting so the bottom two are
running off one GPU and the top two are
running off another GPU and there are
slight differences in like the the
response time so you'll actually see
some like a slight jello effect
sometimes and that probably could be
perceived
are you trying to snipe with that Wow I
can't believe that just worked so we ran
Crysis 3 at medium tomb raider at medium
and Counter Strike global Offensive on
high we're getting a boat yeah it says
like 65 frames per second now that it's
settled in a little bit but it really
doesn't feel that soon so there you have
it are we ready for a K gaming well
based on that we don't have the displays
that can do it without a gigantic bezel
in the middle and based on that we don't
have graphics cards that don't cost less
than 24 hundred US dollars running an
SLI in order to even have a chance of
playing games I would say the answer is
no but is this a unique and unreal
experience
edie it's making me sick it's making you
sick it is so cool he's sick you know
what else makes me sick
phone trees yes my friends when you call
a company and you spend 20 minutes
actually navigating through to the right
person
who ends up not being the right person
anyway and ting hates them too which is
why when you're on ting the mobile
carrier that puts customer satisfaction
first and you pick up a phone and call
them you actually talk to a real live
person no robots whatsoever they're not
available in Canada unfortunately but I
tried it out just for lols and I was
like I knew it was going to happen and I
was still amazed someone's like hello
this is ting what can I do for a blob it
scared me you know what else is scary
the fact that ting does not have huge
bundle packages that they sell to you
for like a hundred bucks a month you pay
only for what you use and you don't have
to try and look into your crystal ball
and kind of go yeah I might need an
extra 500 gigs of data that month I
guess I'd better buy like a bigger more
upgraded package nope the average ting
bill is just 23 bucks a month per device
and they'll even help you out if you are
stuck in a contract covering up to 25%
up to $75 of your cancellation fee they
actually are now lowering mobile data
rates across the board too with data now
at just $10 per gig beyond the first gig
so if all that sounds like kind of cool
but you're not sure if you're actually
going to save any money
all you got to do is head over to Linus
King comm we've got that linked in the
video description to try out their
savings calculator when you sign up at
our link you'll also get 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
so again that's Linus ENCOM so thanks
