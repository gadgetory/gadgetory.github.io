look at the a Seuss g55 V this is a
gaming notebook that's actually been
previously unboxed for the Vancouver
men's show however clearly the last
person who unbox this product was not
the seasoned unboxing professional that
I am because this is upside down
terrible
okay so let's cover what's on the
outside first so lithium okay do not
load a transport package of damage got
it over here we've got the a soos a DW
accidental damage warranty that is
included with their notebooks a one-year
warranty covering accidental drop spills
power surges and fire damage including
24-hour toll-free support and a target 3
business day turnaround time for repair
and replacement not including receiving
and shipping time free one-way standard
shipping from you suits to the user of
your repair notebook so you have to pay
to ship it back to them however throwing
an accidental damage warranty is pretty
crazy pretty crazy awesome to your
international warranty so one year of
which is a tw0 bright guarantee two ways
free standard shipping okay I'm still
confused I don't understand whether it's
two-way free or one-way free but 24/7
tech support is backed up by both halves
of that sticker for certain let's have a
look at what we got in terms of specs
here so this is a 15.6 full HD LED
backlit monitor with not TV and but you
know what this is a terrible spec sheet
forget it I'm not looking at that okay
let's just open her up yeah first thing
we find inside is a gaming mouse I'm not
even gonna bother opening it because
it's not very good you should actually
probably just buy a real Mouse not that
I'm saying that you know it's not usable
but it's like usable on like your
sister's computer and then you can steal
her awesome gaming mouse or something if
you can convince her that the one that
came with your rog gaming notebook is
better alright we've got an inflated rog
on notebook backpack which fits
theoretically the notebook that it comes
with and i'm going to sort of model this
for you guys do my little turn on the
catwalk so this is what i would look
like if i was 15
in high school and I go back back and
the joke they're actually the guys is
that I do wear a backpack every day so
this is what I look like if I walked
around with a backpack on so there you
go
let's take that off actually no let's
not take that off yet let's look inside
it so here's our notebook pouch which
hopefully if oh yeah there I was pretty
disappointed for a second there
hopefully is padded on the move that's
not a lot of padding okay so yeah it's
it's pretty cool but be careful you know
don't drop your bag down like that if
you have this particular backpack and
you've got your expensive fancy notebook
it's like got a small it's got a small
tab in the bottom so it's not completely
unpadded or anything and it's not like a
nice soft thing going on in here but
remember guys this is the free backpack
that came with your notebook if I was
buying a notebook like this and you're
going to see just how awesome it is then
I would definitely get myself a wicked
gaming mouse and a wicked notebook
backpack so that I could be all like
ballin out with my notebook in my
backpack in the mouse and like a boss
like that okay opening it up I don't
know if all the accessories are going to
be in the right place like I said
clearly unfort eat the mouse wasn't even
in that box it was here so now you do
get to see it it has the dpi change
button it's got a scroll wheel it's got
a couple buttons here a couple over here
rubberized grip on the side and that's
pretty much all she wrote about that guy
moving right along we have our power
brick and like I mean when it comes to
bricks you could actually build with
this thing because it's big and here's
my iPhone for comparison which I know
you guys love so very much BAM that's
how big it is alright moving right along
notebook itself this is what I'm excited
about the soap we unboxed their G 75
quite recently which is a similar model
but using a 17 inch screen now
personally I find that a 17 inch screen
is very awesome and very huge and great
as a gaming experience but not quite as
good as a portability experience and I
definitely prefer for myself to have a
15 inch screen which is exactly what is
included
with this one so here we have a couple
accessories we've got a cable tie for
your power adapter warranty card drivers
and a notebook user's manual including
Lou ROG stickers very nice alright let's
turn her on give me a second to get a
boot it up on the bottom we can easily
see all of the upgrade panels there's
your battery upgrade more like removal
and like putting back in if you need to
for whatever reason here we have access
to our memory as well as our hard drive
so that covers that let's do the
external of it so ultimate fighting
machine Asus gaming notebook ROG Arsenal
presents taking off the sticker so that
we can see what they look looks like
without it because most people won't
keep it on on this side we've got a
Kensington lock two USB 3.0 ports
microphone headphones and a DVD
multi-drive on the back we find
ventilation so check this out we've got
a full sized heatsink that runs all the
way from here to here the rest of this
is actually plastic filler so it looks
like you know a massive heatsink was
enough to take care of the 660 M as well
as the until Core i7 quad core processor
inside this machine I'm actually just
going to take this off as well because
that's sort of interfering with the
gorgeousness the back of the unit has a
soft touch feel which personally I quite
like everyone's got a bit of a different
opinion about soft touch but I really
like cases anything that I'm not going
to touch too much I like to see the soft
touch finish on because it can wear out
like I have a g9 Mouse that really wore
out and then it kind of peels off but if
you're not going to be all over it all
the time it looks really good it stays
really clean looking all the time and
yeah I like it so shiny Asus logo
Republic of gamers logo on the back as
well moving around to the other side
we've got gigabit ethernet power VGA
Thunderbolt yeah HDMI as well as two
more USB 3.0 SuperSpeed ports now you
notice the lack of an SD card reader Ben
there it is right in the front as well
as all of your indicator lights for
things like hard drive Wireless capsule
number lock and all that good stuff
speaking of number lock in spite of its
15 inch form factor this notebook has a
full desktop ish keyboard meaning it's
got a properly laid out set of arrow
keys a full number pad as well as a full
size backlit keyboard I want to get you
guys a view of the backlighting on the
keyboard if I could even move in the
room here at all right now there's so
much stuff all over the floor there we
go how's it look awesome and white love
it
alright I'm actually I think white is
probably either my favorite or my second
favorite backlight keyboard color I do
really like green as well speaking of
soft touch they have a more durable type
of soft touch here this has a texture to
it so this will actually be far less
likely to wear off when you have your
palms resting on it all the time they've
also got a nice big wide screen touch
pad as well as left and right clicks
which are to be expected at this point
in time 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
processor I don't know if I mentioned
that before so that's a 36th nqm it also
has a gtx 660 so with its bigger brother
you get in Abood SSD you get a more
powerful graphics card you do get a I
mean those are the biggest things you
get the bigger screen yeah one thing
that you get with both of them though is
the 3d capable display so your emitter
is embedded in here somewhere all you
got to do is source yourself some 3d
glasses they're about 100 bucks I think
and you are ready for 3d gaming as soon
as you can say Bob's your uncle and you
configure it in the Nvidia driver and I
personally think that's pretty awesome
so remember it's not only good for games
but also for movies and whatever else
you want to do in stereoscopic 3d if you
have the supported applications
installed has duel fans apparently which
is kind of cool also has 12 gigs of ram
as well as a 750 gig hard drive now
there's no SSD that is disappointing but
you can always go with the G 75 or you
can rip the drive out and throw in an
SSD very easily if you want because it's
very accessible on the bottom and the
cord fell out so apparently it does have
a battery and I mean unlike the 17 inch
bigger brother is much lighter and much
more portable so it's just a
deciding what you want out of it oh yeah
hinge durability is one of the things
that Isis has done a fantastic job with
on their G Series notebooks look at
these heavy duty hinges I really just
don't expect them to break in in any way
at any point in time love it and then
finally the sound is done via the
speakers all along the top here once
again another upgrade that the G 75 has
is the subwoofer on the bottom this one
does not have that so the G 75 is
clearly the higher-end machine but it is
clearly designed for the more hardcore
gamer that is willing to sacrifice the
portability to get those extra bells and
whistles so thank you for checking out
my unboxing at first look at the G 55 V
