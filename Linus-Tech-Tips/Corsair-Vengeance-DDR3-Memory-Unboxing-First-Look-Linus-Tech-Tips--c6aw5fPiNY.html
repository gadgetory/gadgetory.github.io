like to make a habit of while not
unboxing every Ram kit that you know
ever comes out because there's far too
many configurations for that rather
there are far too many configurations
for that I do like to make a habit of
unboxing at least each heat spreader
that comes out so I have not yet had a
chance to check out the Vengeance heat
spreader from Corsair now vengeance is
sort of a value line from Corsair but
what's cool about it is that unlike many
lines of memory from other vendors you
can see here that this one is optimized
for core i3 Core i5 core i7 and AMD
Phenom x2 so the timing is pretty good
for that as AMD sales are pretty good at
the moment
with their six core processors being
such a wicked value for video editors
and such but you can see each module
it's actually packaged individually this
is smart because it means that Corsair
can easily just by producing a different
size box make them into a dual channel
or a triple channel kit and by
programming the SPD slightly different
Lee so this particular kit is an 8 gig
kit so that is it is 2 4 gig modules and
unlike the picture which shows them as
sort of a matte finish you can see here
that the vengeance heat spreader is sort
of in-between a matte and a glossy
finish so it looks quite looks quite
sleek now I don't actually have a
motherboard handy to show you guys what
it looks like when it's installed but
you can see here that the graphics are
actually done via a sticker so there's a
sticker that wraps around the top here
there's a sticker that goes on the side
here and then there's also a sticker
over here that has the part number of
bar code as well as all the information
about this kit so why don't we have a
look at what this kit has to say for
itself so it's a 2 by 4 gig kit this is
a four gig Tim it runs at 1600 megahertz
999 24 and look at that nice low voltage
only 1.5 volts on this particular
Vengeance kit so while the heat spreader
frankly doesn't really do that much in
terms of RAM performance at this point
it's often part of a nicely
style build and it couldn't be that hard
to find something that'll go well with
the Vengeance module so thanks for
watching Linus tech tips don't forget to
subscribe and yeah please don't forget
to subscribe I think I was going to say
something else but I forgot what it was
thanks for watching subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
