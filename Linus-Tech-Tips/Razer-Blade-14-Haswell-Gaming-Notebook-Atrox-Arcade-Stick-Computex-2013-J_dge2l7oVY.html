2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm welcome to the razor suite
at computex 2013 this is the thing that
everyone's excited about this is the
razor blade 14 inch gaming laptop this
features an intel core i7 fourth
generation haswell processor so that
means yes guys we are benefiting in a
big way from the improved performances
Haswell ok yeah a little bit but mainly
from the improved power consumption so
it's finally getting to the point now
where there's so little heat output and
so little power consumption that a
Haswell gaming notebook with a gtx 765m
can be crammed into a point six six inch
form factor so it has eight gigs of
memory it's got a 128 gig SSD although
it's upgradeable to 256 it's got a
14-inch 1600 x 900 screen which is going
to be a good resolution for a gtx 765m
there's a pro version that's 17 inch as
well but we don't have that one here so
you can see ventilation on the bottom is
provided by a couple of fans there are
two rubber strips on the bottom of the
chassis so I'm just going to go ahead
and put this down fully aluminum chassis
man it's beautiful razors gaming systems
look so good so these right here are
rubber so that it's not going to move
around in terms of i/o it's pretty
straightforward so you've got power in
right here as well as two USB 3
SuperSpeed ports and your headphone
microphone combo jack along the back
there's absolutely nothing it's very
very clean looking you've got that
illuminated Razer logo on the top that
we showed you before and then here on
the other side you've got a Kensington
lock HDMI out as well as an additional
USB 3 port on the front there's nothing
but a hinge and we're going to go ahead
and open that up and i'm going to give
you guys another look at of course it's
going to be instant on because it's got
an SSD but check out that illuminated
keyboard man that's gorgeous so you've
got the usual gaming keyboard
functionality so you can turn down the
brightness of the screen you can turn
down the brightness of the gaming
keyboard itself
so you can decide whether you want that
razors backlit keyboards particularly
stuff like their Black Widow 2013
edition black widow ultimate are so
bright and so vibrant they're claiming
about six hours of battery life which I
actually find more impressive than the
just the general slimness and spec and
all of that stuff nice big touchpad left
right mouse buttons right here exactly
where they should be we saw one notebook
here at the show that had the that the
touchpad above the keyboard so they
haven't really done anything sort of
outlandish in terms of the overall
layout speakers are left and right
mounted honestly if you want a nice
clean slim notebook that is not only
going to look good but also perform well
this is the first razor blade that i can
say like yeah if i was buying a laptop
this is this is definitely in my in my
top list the one thing that i still have
a bit of a problem with is that this is
a TN panel so it is not an IPS panel
I'll be interested to see if the pro
version has an IPS panel but
unfortunately we don't have one of those
here the power brick itself isn't that
huge so I can go ahead and do my phone
size comparison right there so not bad
at all remember guys this is an HTC One
so that could should give you some idea
what you're looking at in terms of
sizing and if point 6 6 inches doesn't
mean anything to you I should probably
probably also do my trademark phone size
comparison with the notebook itself so
that gives you some idea how slim this
thing is it's incredibly well
constructed speaking of well constructed
that leads us to denton attenti razors
fight stick so this is the first time
they've really gotten into this and
they're trying to address that market in
a very meaningful way this is the atrix
which they're calling the most
customizable fightstick available on the
market so okay BYE MOM you know we'll
start on the outside will start on the
outside so on the outside it looks like
a fight stick so you got a joystick you
got some buttons that you can press you
got some more buttons you can press on
the side there's your start and your
back button on the bottom you've got a
nice rubberized finish that's not going
to slip anywhere whether you're holding
it on your lap putting on a table or
wherever else and on the other side you
find not a whole lot of anything so when
we open it up these are
genuine sanwa switches which apparently
is a big deal not only that but they're
completely replaceable easily accessible
so speaking of easily accessible you've
got an alternate head for the joystick
right here that is in a nice little
storage compartment you've got a tool
for a making adjustments oh that's a
flathead and Phillips head screwdriver
you've also got the cord this little
place to store that it's only compatible
pc and xbox 360 but check this out you
want to make modifications to this thing
they've got a honeycomb structure on the
entire bottom of the casing so you can
use all this for storage or you can use
it to easily screw mount any kinds of
modifications that you might make to the
device so the idea is you can carry
around different switches if you find
that optimal for a particular playing
style or whatever else you want to do
you can carry around any little tools
and any kind of gear that you need to
take with you to a tournament or whether
it's just to keep it in one place so you
don't lose it when you're using it at
home so this is this is a very very
customized very special piece of gaming
equipment we're really looking forward
to checking it out in more detail
because it's no secret that fightstick
owners are some of the fussiest guys out
there when it comes to having just the
right thing and looks are another thing
that that are a factor and of course you
can replace the razor graphics that are
on the top of it with anything you
choose simply by swapping it out that's
just a plexi plate holding it down guys
