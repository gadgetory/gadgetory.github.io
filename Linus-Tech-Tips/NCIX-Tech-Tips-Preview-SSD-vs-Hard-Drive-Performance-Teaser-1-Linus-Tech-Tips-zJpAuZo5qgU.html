bit of a precursor to a full NCIX tech
tips episode that i'm working on behind
the scenes i'm going to be doing a quick
practical demonstration of SSD vs hard
drive so what I've done is I've taken
these two computers and i've restarted
them and i just want to do a an
apples-to-apples comparison of the boot
time between an SSD which is the system
on my left are on your left my left's in
left and a mechanical hard drive we're
running the western digital one terabyte
black hard drive okay so i want to show
you just how much faster you can boot
into windows and start using your
computer when you're running a
solid-state drive now I've kind of run
out of things to say so what we're going
to do is we're all just going to sit
together and watch so I'm going to go
ahead and demonstrate that the computer
is instantly usable with an SSD Drive
whereas even with a hard drive okay so
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
click on internet explorer as soon as I
possibly can i mean we're done over here
still logging into windows even once you
see the desktop the computer will be
quite slow to respond for a while while
it gets caught up and you can see even
the web page loads more slowly I can't
even I can't even switch to Internet
Explorer right now there we go I had to
click twice so that was just my quick
demonstration there we go we loaded the
web page of SSD vs hard drive in sort of
a very practical everyday scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
