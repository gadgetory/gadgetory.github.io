our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner we're
here in the monitor part of the Samsung
booth and we have the SC 770 touch this
is their series 7 easy sliding design
touchscreen monitor so the idea is it's
got 60 degrees of tilt that you can
adjust with one finger just like that so
why would you want to do that I've
talked a lot about on the desktop how
touch screen is not necessarily the
easiest thing to do because you position
your arm out in front of you at a bit of
an uncomfortable length and it can get
fatiguing if you push the monitor down
like this you will alleviate a lot of
that strain because it's a more natural
position to use it you can also see that
the bottom of the bezel here does move
slightly towards the user so if you were
going to say for example use an
on-screen keyboard to type something
quickly you'd be able to do that more
comfortably now arguably with a desktop
with a 27-inch monitor next to it you
would probably have a keyboard but a lot
of parts of Windows 8 can be more easily
navigated more comfortably navigated
with touch so spec wise it's available
in 24 or 27 inches 16 by 9 it's led it
is using a TN panel but it is one of the
better ones that I've seen in terms of
viewing angles so if you want to go
ahead and catch it from the side here
there's what your color looks like from
the front there's what it looks like
from the side so it's much better than
ones that I've seen in the past it has a
little demo that's built into it so we
can go ahead and go through everything
here and I seem to have I seem to have
broken it flat there's okay sliding
design we've talked about this and oh
boy I have to put a puzzle together
apparently - to do this so that is that
is one way to make people go ahead and
enjoy the touch experience so you guys
can see how quickly I can solve this
puzzle I suppose
there we go this guy goes here this is
here this is here and this is here
excellent so now we're allowed to see it
so the 10-point touch demo is basically
just showing that you can go like this
and sort of touch it all over the place
and things will fall away next is your
style for ultimate touch experience so
there she's showing the sliding design
and sort of what bezels used to look
like versus what they look like now
slick knows all about that he has a
really old monitor more functionality so
they have stereo speakers built-in and
last but not least two HDMI ports in so
there's a USB three at the back which is
how the touchscreen interface runs and
there's two HDMI ports so you can have
it running off of your desktop and then
you can just have an HDMI cable sort of
hanging here and you can plug your
laptop into it whenever you sit down in
front of your desk don't miss any of our
