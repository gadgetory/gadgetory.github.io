switch from Linksys and since pretty
much you know everyone knows you know
what links this is and what their value
add is and since you know everyone
pretty much knows that there's not a
whole lot of variation when it comes
from switch to switch and other than
basically power consumption and
reliability I'm just going to talk about
more than anything else what you really
need a switch for so first of all let's
see links this has to say for themselves
plug and play I certainly hope so eight
gigabit ports ok up to 10 times faster
yes than 10 hundred and QoS enabled ok
that's kind of neat and power savings so
yes this is more of like a green smart
power switch so smart power for short
cable runs which basically turns down
the transmission power and when it
detects a short cable and Auto
power-down disables unused parts so that
does help you consume less energy with
your switch than you otherwise would
port status which gives you control over
LED lights neat ok Auto sensing torch
work with ten hundred networks they
better and you get award-winning 24/7
support from the first 90 days so if you
plug in your switch and you're having
trouble with it at least there's someone
to call other than me
you can call Cisco and they can help you
you'd be surprised how many people like
message me and ask me like stuff like
you know my switch isn't working what do
I do I'm like I don't know man I don't
know your network I don't know like what
you're trying to do I don't know what
kind of switch you have yeah
anyway comes with a power cord comes
with this Quick Start Guide comes with a
product information thing yeah I guess I
wasn't really expecting much more to be
included with this it's so what do you
need a switch for so switch is basically
a way of splitting in a more intelligent
manner
I network connections so here perfect
example is right here actually a my okay
my main network hub is in the other room
so like one room over there and what I
have there is I have my modem from Shaw
and then I have my router which has four
ports and then I have a switch and that
switch plugs into the powerline kit
that's going downstairs and it plugs
into the two computers that are in that
room I have a spare coming off when I
need to plug something in temporarily I
have one that goes into the room on this
side for my Windows Home Server and I
have one that comes actually here check
this up right over here I have one that
comes in through the wall very elegantly
by the way that runs to this wireless
router right here now I'm no longer
using this for its wireless capability
I've actually turned off the routing and
turned off the wireless and I'm just
using it as a switch because it's a four
port switch so that way I have one
incoming I have one going out to the
test bench and then I have one going out
to my work laptop whatever I'm doing
work from home in this room so that's
what a switch does you basically take
one gigabit backbone and then you run
that out to a bunch of other gigabit
things so the way that these computers
or devices are going to communicate with
each other
is let's say your your connection to the
main network your main gigabit network
is through one that means that computer
is plugged into a computer plugged into
port two can communicate via gigabit to
that network however if you have three
computers in ports two three and four
and they all need to communicate with
something on the other side so through
here then you're going to be limited to
total gigabit speed with three so that
is sort of its theoretical 333 megabits
per second however computer 2 could talk
to a computer for at full gigabit speed
so what you're doing is you're you're
creating like a sort of a sub gigabit
network that then has one gigabit link
to the rest of your in theory fully
gigabit network okay so this is the SE
2800 it is a pretty plain looking little
box it's got a Cisco logo on the front
it's got some ventilation holes all the
way around the outside of the chassis
it's got a power indicator as well as
power in and the ability to turn the
lights on and off in theory okay it's
got eight ports and these are all
gigabit as I've covered some
time so far and it has ventilation on
the bottom see we got little feet here
so that it sits a little bit off the
table or floor or wherever you put it
and then you're going to have natural
convection drawing air through the
bottom and then out the side so thank
you for checking out my unboxing the SE
2800 don't forget to subscribe to
