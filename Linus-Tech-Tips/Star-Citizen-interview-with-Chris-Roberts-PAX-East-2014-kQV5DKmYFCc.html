2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys we're here at PAX
East with chris Roberts at the Logitech
booth and I've got a bunch of questions
for you first off though we've seen the
hangar module we've now seen the
dogfighting module once this game is
released way off in the future what is
going to be the success metric for you
at one point in time will you be able to
sit back and go like okay this is this
is star system this is what I wanted
well how long the so for me I won't be
happy until the full universe is there
you can travel around that so the level
and scope they want so even in the early
stages sort of like alpha beta position
universe we probably won't have enough
of the star systems for me to feel
successful but essentially I want a sort
of big vibrant stable community that's
making their own like stories and
history up that we sort of manage and
when we get there then I'll be happy
where they want to add a bunch extra
features so I mean I don't see it ending
anytime soon so for me the first part of
the Sprint is just to get like all the
features in and then at that point sort
of start to massage it make it you know
play as well as possible and then start
adding additional content and letting it
grow I'm actually really interested to
see the universe grow like we're
actually planning on a whole bunch of
sort of functionality that's based
around a dynamic like locations and so
like if you have a colony and the when
you first starting playing the game and
it's going well in that system then over
time like maybe a year later you'd come
back and the colonies come into a small
town and a year later it's grown into a
bustling city and so it would we're
actually building that kind of tech into
all the different planets and
environments it's all managed by the
economy simulator and we're going to all
have it visually represented in the
different places so I'm just really
curious you know two years on or three
years on hopefully if we last that long
which thing you know whatever
touchwood somewhere yeah just just to
see that universe sort of grown evolve I
mean it's really you know when you look
at World of Warcraft or EVE Online as
some of the other MMOs that have lasted
a long time it's really kind of
interesting because you sort of see them
now and you see when they started and
they're quite different game
right so I'm kind of looking forward to
getting the bass in there and then sort
of seeing how it goes from there yeah
for sure and like when looking at all
that kind of stuff from our organization
uol t.t even just within ourselves it's
interesting to see how much you guys
foster just creative development within
the community because we've done some
crazy stuff and it's been really well
received everywhere like a few guys in
the audience will know project monarch
has been received really well with all
the guys and it's this crazy ridiculous
plan so it's it's actually really nice
to see that you guys are supporting the
community like that now completely
different question what's your favorite
part of the current dog training module
okay well actually there's some stuff
that I actually didn't manage to demo on
stage so we're gonna do some videos this
week but first of all the zero-g
stuffings which I noticed here actually
on the floor for some reason in the
swarm mode all the g-force stuff is aa
g-force is on but you don't see the
animation so you don't see the cockpit
sway so I actually try to figure out why
that's happening but but you actually
can I checked out of your ship and be in
zero-g and actually fly around in zero-g
there's little jetpacks on your you're
your pilot sooo so I'm gonna show a
video of that later on this week so
that's kind of fun but sort of the
multiplayer deathmatch stuff the funnest
which is also one of the things that on
Thursday night we did the presentation
we had server issues so I guess a lot of
the fun stuff I didn't really get demo
but people are really gonna like it I
mean that you know I think it looks
great and it's kind of got a fun sort of
fast-paced gameplay and I'm kind of
looking forward to seeing everyone play
it and they'll be really good just to
sort of a see what people do and be see
kind of where the areas that maybe need
balancing or what works for people what
people don't quite understand because a
lot of features sort of under the hood
right so there's all the different so
you can fly the normal way but you can
turn it off and you have the decoupled
way where you could just change your
orientation and also you can strafe also
in that DK ball mates you go left right
up down forward back so I'm interested
to see like people start to use that for
that
and then there's shield management and
energy management of your weapons like
so if you're just running around in the
swamp mode here you'll see when you're
firing weapons you can see the heat and
stuff going down there's actually
management stuff for that inside the
hood interface which partly is hooked up
but not fully hooked up and it will be
for the actual proper dogfight release
so I'll be interesting to sort of see
how all people judge that so we got a
lot of little sort of Polish tweaking
stuff to do in the module and then
obviously you get the backend super
reliable which is sort of that's what's
holding up us giving it to everyone
right now but yeah when we get all our
be really curious I'm you know because
we got leaderboards for organizations
and individual so yeah kind of I'm
curious to see who's gonna be who's
gonna be the top dog fighter I'm really
excited to jump on that and I think our
group will do really well but looking at
like you're talking about you have to
get a server back-end strong before you
can actually release all that kind of
stuff how the community seems to be
perceiving now I'm going to say betas
but this is like pre pre pre alpha
whatever you want to call it are you
guys worried about community reception
because I know at be at the pre event on
Thursday before PAX East it was it was
very positive but that is some of the
hardcore sand like I know I don't care
if I run into bugs and I'll do as much
as I can to do bug reports what are you
are you worried about community
reception at all well I mean obviously
that's that's the concern is that people
don't understand that they're getting
this way sooner you know like normally
if you get like a beta from a publisher
it's not really a beta it's like it's
basically they're giving you the game
they're like a month before a demo to
get people interested and they pretty
much think it's done whereas we're
really like this is by the seat of our
pants okay we think it works so you guys
go and so I'm hoping I mean I was
actually surprised on Thursday night
like how a positive it was because I was
actually pretty bummed I was like oh my
god we didn't get a show isn't gonna
show that disaster and like the next day
like all the press was great and all the
people at the event were great and I was
like okay but I think the difference is
that it's like it it's like a different
mentality so I think a lot of the
community I'm maybe all the community I
don't know but but everyone sort of
feels like they're in this together you
know so they're part of and they
appreciate sort of getting all the
development updates as it comes along
and so seeing so they sort of understand
that you know they wouldn't normally get
it this this isn't a slick publisher
beta this is really early for feedback
so they're their opinions of math and
voices matter right so like if people
say oh I think this is unbalanced
I find this too hard to control best
stuff we take on board and will actually
affect the gameplay and so I so I'm
hoping that people understand that and
you know the price you pay for that
early involvement is that it's not
necessarily going to be as stable as
slick or as polished as it would
normally be in a traditional publisher
setup so I hope so I mean I'm sure
there'll be a few people like this sucks
I want my money back this game doesn't
play right but all right you know I know
at the end of the day it's like look
we're quite a ways off from having to
finish game and this games only gonna be
better by like everyone's involvement of
feedback and I'd rather be open and give
it because I'm actually enjoying it
right it's really great to sort of see
the involvement from the community SEOs
enthusiasm and also see Avon sort of
ideas it doesn't mean that you you rate
your able or want to react to it one's
ideas but certainly the ones that like
makes sense here you go yeah you know
that makes sense let's bring that aboard
so I like the process and and and you
know I really do I mean like I've had a
great time here at PAX I meet all you
know huge amount of our community
members and everyone just sort of feels
like a part of the team you know and
it's kind of cool and you said have fun
and show them stuff and you're proud of
and they're excited and so so you know
despite the possible pitfalls you know
I'm I'm okay with it it's gonna be good
obviously that's got to be one of the
benefits of being an open in an open
development environment is people are
supportive because being at the
pre-event on Thursday when the helmet
flipped that was the most ridiculous
thing ever the entire whole Club just
exploded all it was because that was
just amazing and it is interesting to
see and I do think it's going to be
better received as you said because of
how it is in open development now with a
game like this how do you manage
expectations with a game
well I don't know it's really hard I
mean I know that it's a lot of people
think oh my god it's like it's happy
unbelief it's - but you know I don't
necessarily think that it's us hyping it
right I just think that if everyone's
getting excited probably because there
hasn't been a game like this and then
this and then we're really just sort of
shooting for the stars right so it's not
just like oh we're just gonna fly around
in space it's like you know no you get
me down and your first person on the
planet at least level of detail you're
gonna get into ship in this level of
detail you'll be able to walk around the
big ships and they love leaderboard
other ships so it's like pretty much
sort of checking list of anyone that
played the space games like dream game
which is my dream game right so so yeah
I mean I guess you know and then at the
point because we're early in the process
you know everyone's got their own idea
how the game's gonna be and you know I
don't I mean obviously just can't you
know people's ideas to what the final
product gonna be it's never going to
consistently match up because you've got
so many people but I do think we'll
manage to have enough of all these
features that will be that well enough
done that it will be you know if we get
70% of what we're planning into final
game I think it will be a really really
great game but yeah I don't know how you
know I don't know how to manage the
expectations particularly well because
you know I'm excited by what we're doing
and of course I think we're gonna do
something really great so I'll be there
go know well you know it's maybe it's
okay I mean I'm good yeah I'm really
proud of how this thing's going so all I
ask people is you know you just have to
be patient during the process right so a
lot of times I do see like in our
community people sort of see something
or they hear something on the forums and
then the sky is falling because that
possibly can't work and I sort of think
well why don't we just wait till you
actually get to play it in the game and
then see if it works and then at that
point you're gonna have we can have a
discussion about it but you know that
doesn't always happen but you know that
that's just the nature of the beast I
mean you know you I mean we've got a lot
of people and they're very excited for
this and so I guess I would rather have
vigorous debate on the forums but no
debate at all right because it shows
people are invested in the game that's
getting made and they care which is
which is great honestly I think
I've seen on our forums people talk
about the game all the time and all that
kind of stuff and I've seen a lot of
huge expectations but I think what's
helping it on our side at least is
everything that people are expecting you
guys seem to just be doing all of the
time like everything that everyone
wanted to see in dog fighting on the
pre-event that there was more than what
everyone had expected which is kind of
amazing that you guys were able to keep
up with that level of development
there's tons of people here waiting for
you so I'm going to let you go thanks
for taking time out of your day to have
this interview I really appreciate it
