the third member of the GTX 400
so up here on top for comparison we'll
get more on this later as a GTX 480 but
the one we're actually looking at today
is the GTX 465 this is a PNY accelerate
xlr8 performance Edition card it is okay
they have a couple of extra things that
are included with their cards that
aren't included with others you get two
bonus movie downloads and they have a
few examples of what you can download
Muppets in space The Da Vinci Code SWAT
some movie I think it's about counting
cards and Rudy so you can may get two
bonus movie downloads and then you get a
three month subscription to ESEA alright
go around to the back and we'll find the
basic specs while I start to open the
packaging so it is sli ready it has
physics support it has 3d vision support
just like the GTX 470 and the 480 the
biggest difference with the 465 is
actually probably on the front yes here
only one gig of DDR
so that means that compared to its
bigger brothers you're gonna have a
little bit less room and you're also
gonna have a little bit less performance
because it does have fewer processing
cores so we'll have a quick look at
what's included here we've got the Quick
Start Guide okay it's pretty much a
standard Quick Start Guide shows you how
to install a video card then we have the
installation disk make sure you download
the latest drivers off the Nvidia
website their latest fab data is
actually really good then you've got a
dual molex to one PCIe 6 X connector you
have a mini HDMI to HDMI adapter and
then you have a DVI to VGA adapter you
so you can plug in pretty much every
conceivable connector here so the way
it's packed is just in little phones
here and it's sort of sturdy enough
although it's not this was a quick to
market card so you don't expect full
custom packaging for it and let's have a
look so far it looks just like a gtx 470
one big difference that it that it
doesn't have especially looking here why
don't we compare it to the 480 instead
okay so the big first thing we notice
compared to the 480 is that it doesn't
have
the the heatsink surface on the actual
front of the card so it doesn't have
these heat pipes that as you can see
come out of the top of the card leading
to more ventilation space as well as
this heatsink surface here it does still
use a fan blower design so you can see
the whole second slot is designed for
air flow to be vented by this fan out
the front of the case and this fan is
completely shrouded in so that it's not
going to exhaust any air back this way
this takes all the warm air from inside
your case cools your card and then blows
it out of the back of the case up on the
top we find two 6-pin PCI Express power
connectors as well as a one inch shorter
length compared to the six pin and eight
pin on the 480 as well as a one inch
longer length the sticker is also rather
strongly applied on this one but I'm
sure that's just this sample and not
representative of all of them the back
of them both look the same okay and then
let's have a look so this is a standard
PCIe 16x card you're gonna find your
your standard 16 X PCI Express connector
along the bottom that's fairly normal
and one thing that you will notice about
the 465 especially on these first cards
is that it actually has all of the
memory chip spots three four five six
seven eight oh no I mean hold on maybe
it doesn't one two three four five six
seven yeah you know what I can't tell
how many that is they might have eight
it might have 10 it's probably using a
GTX a 470 PCB but actually with two
theater Ram chip soldered on because it
was it was up to the adding partners to
design the boards for the 465 it uses a
very similar design where the fan has
access both at the back and the front of
the PCB to fresh air
you've got two sli connectors up on the
top so if you're going to be running SLI
either two-way or 3-way SLI or if you're
going to be running 3d vision surround
which you need to run SLI in order to
use you're gonna need those moving
around to the back of the card we've got
two DVI ports and one mini HDMI although
you can't run three monitors off the
card at the same time so that was pretty
much all I wanted to say about the PTA
PTX PNY GTX 460 5 1 gig graphics card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
