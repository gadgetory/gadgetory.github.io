unboxing that's not really relevant from
a from a product standpoint but it's
more interesting because it marks the
reintroduction of the pallet brand back
into North America now pallet was around
in Europe and Asia for a long time
they've been very successful there and
they tried about a year ago in North
America and eventually ended up pulling
out and their cards kind of disappeared
from the shelves but now they're back
and bigger than ever and so I've got a
pallet gtx 260 here it's a 216 stream
process or 260 with 896 Meg's of RAM 448
bit interface with that Ram etc etc etc
one cool thing that it does have is a H
and a HDMI and HDMI output now palettes
big value add is that they are at him
this is a sonic overclocking edition
their thing is play at tweak it get more
out of it they claim that their cards
because they never use reference designs
they always design their own PCBs they
say that you can get more overclocking
and more performance out of their cards
versus with another manufacturer now my
camera person just showed up so if I
could get them to grab the camera and
let's have a look at what we will find
inside the box for the pallet 260 yeah
awesome
thank you so first we will find inside
this huge box they keep the phone okay
there you go
there's your phone author next in terms
of accessories we will find a DVI to
HDMI adapter oh no this is not that
thing this is an HDMI to DVI adapter
slightly different so that you can take
the HDMI port that is present on the
card and you can make this into a dual
DVI card very clever
okay but I'm not done with the
accessories yet so now we have a two
molex to one PCI Express power adapter
they only give you one I guess because
this card only has one connector as my
guest but we'll find out later when we
actually look at the card we're not
looking yet and this is one this seems
to be one of those little audio adapters
or something yeah ground and
not doesn't tell me what the other ones
for that's terrific it's not labeled but
I think it's the little audience okay so
then we'll take out this huge piece of
foam which is like very well packed you
can see this is really good quality foam
here okay inside we will find a quick
installation guide and a driver disk Wow
I don't think I've seen compact discs
written out like that in years that is
terrific okay quick installation guide
from Nvidia do-do-do-do-do install the
driver okay that's all pretty
straightforward budget Wow it even has
Romanian in here you can tell they're a
global company when all the languages
that are present in that installation so
let's have a look at the cart itself the
first thing the very first thing you'll
notice about it is what I said before
this is not a reference card folks so
pal it takes a lot of pride in designing
their own PCBs for NVIDIA GeForce
graphics solutions so you can see this
one has a dual fan solution over what
appears to be three heat pipes running
along the core of this video card and
then running up into can you see that
can you see that okay run then running
up into the fins that are cooled by
these fans now this fan right here if
you look down into it this way can you
can you see in there very well yeah so
you can see that this fan is not
entirely dedicated to cooling the heat
pipes in the fins and actually a lot of
the air is shunted off this way so that
it'll cool the voltage regulators which
are over here and have a very nice
that's just a nice looking card actually
have them has a nice heatsink on it over
here all right so let's have a look
let's see okay first of all red PCB on
the back that is a bright red PCB very
distinctive looking now you can tell one
thing about palette they do not allow
you to remove your stock cooler to keep
your warranty so that's a difference
from some of the other manufacturers
like EVGA and XFX who do allow you to
remove it you've got your two fingers
for SLI on the back
alright you got your standard PCI
Express 16x connector alright so let's
move around to the top where we will
find two 6-pin adapter so I guess they
only give you our two to adapt ders to
6-pin PCI Express plug so I guess they
only give you one because they figure if
you're actually using a power supply
that doesn't have at least one PCI
Express
connector on you probably ought not be
running this card all right so the top
here you can see that they've left and
opens I'll open open slot here so that
the fans will blow air out of the card
this way so they're actually blowing air
out this way blowing air out this way
and blowing air out this way so there's
not going to be a lot of air restriction
in this cooler I really like that okay
so you can see at the back we've got
this is a dual slot card so you've got
vents here and then you've also got HDMI
VGA and DVI and they've given you that
handy HDMI to DVI connector so if you
don't have an HD I'm HDMI monitor you
can just use dual DVI quite easily Wow
look at that so you got more ventilation
coming out the bottom so this will
actually blow air onto your motherboard
components under the video card that is
swell because so many video cards
overlook this and do not provide any
cooling to that area under there that
gets almost no airflow whatsoever so I
think that pretty much covers my
unboxing of the geforce gtx 260 from
pallet this is a sonic edition and this
is a sonic condition of tech tips or
something thank you for checking out my
video blog and i'll talk to you later
