charges all android phones and I mean
any other phone I suppose with light up
eyes movable arms a matching stand and a
micro USB cable so let's go ahead and
get Andrew opened up caution not a toy
USB power supply not for use by children
portions of this product are based on
work read and chart by Google and used
according to the terms described in
creative com the super no tribution
license at renault k where made in china
and if i could figure out how to get it
open that would be great fathers tape
what sort of a thing way to close off
the packaging without it looking like
it's just taped shut looks good and
there we go Andrew yay okay this is
adorable it's like 25 bucks or something
like that and so yeah it's not the
cheapest USB wall charger but it's
definitely the cutest that I've yet to
see comes with a little stand which is
cubed comes with a little green cable
which is also cute so you can take your
little Andrew dude and you can put them
here you can sort of stand there I think
he's sort of useless when you put them
on the stand because then you can't plug
it into the wall but that's okay got all
your certifications I it's got some heft
too much feels kind of beefy then you
plug this in and you plug it into oh
yeah give me your phone sleep and then
you plug in your phone and of course it
won't charge yet but we're gonna go
ahead and plug and you're in but first
let's have a look at his poseable arms
yay ha yeah hands down yay okay ah let's
go find a let's go find a walk
okay so we're gonna unplug our AR Drone
battery plugin Andrew look at his lady
buys can you see it nice does the strip
around him live no he just has light up
blue eyes just like that and that's
pretty much the whole point um Andrew
was adorable and he's a USB charger and
