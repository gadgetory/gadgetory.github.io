Radeon HD 7770 overclocked gigahertz
Edition with their vapor x vapor chamber
cooler it comes with an HDMI high-speed
extension cable it has one gig of gddr3
memory and it has also one gig of Hertz
1 gigahertz Edition so that means the
GPU core is actually clocked at 1
gigahertz or more so that's how they're
able to use the AMD branding dual fan
cooling quiet PCI Express 3.0
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI in the app
acceleration in the affinity 2.0 which
is basically more flexible software more
options for Eyefinity and this uses the
latest 28 nanometer manufacturing
process that is the latest we've seen on
GPUs Intel's doing 22 nanometer on CPUs
already which is craziness gddr5 memory
my opinon do - ok AMD crossfire X is
fully supported up to 2 way crossfire X
Microsoft DirectX 11 it better be at
this point in time and it supports AMD
HD 3d technology even over HDMI meaning
you can either watch your movies or play
your games in 3d with this graphics card
as long as you have the supported
display as well as the compatible
middleware so unfortunately AMD graphics
cards don't have a sort of cookie cutter
solution like 3d vision so you have to
use the one of a couple different
available middlewares and then a
compatible display so bundled
accessories HDMI cable very cool we also
have a molex to PCIe 6 pin adapter these
are handy even if your graphics card
comes with one of these and you don't
need it you might as well just hold on
to that for petrie we have a DVI to vga
adapter ok because this is more of a
mid-range gaming card I'm not gonna give
you guys too hard of a time if you have
a VGA monitor still ok driver
installation CD Sapphire graphics card
quick installation guide sapphire
product registration ok cool
oh and you can even join
their gold membership flow inside
there's a code on the back of your
product registration card there are
benefits no it's looks giving me a funny
look no there are benefits they do like
giveaways and stuff well that's cool
okay so let's go ahead where we will
find the vapor acts cooler so what is
the key difference between vapor chamber
and heat pipe you can see there's heat
pipes too which is sort of fascinating
are they vapor chambers
they look like heat pipes give me a
second and we figured it out so this
piece down here at the very bottom is a
vapor chamber so that spreads the heat
out to the fins and these heat pipes
right above the vapor chamber actually
carry heat out to the far extremities of
the cooler where it can be carried away
by the fans so the heat the the vapor
chamber takes care of sort of this area
with the heat pipes pulling heat away to
these areas here that should give this
actually very effective coverage in
terms of cooling because they're using
two different technologies to move the
heat away from the GPU core itself which
is located here out to the far reaches
of the cooler because you can have as
big a cooler as you want and if you
don't have an efficient way to move the
heat to the far reaching fins then
basically all the heats been removed by
the time it actually can get over there
and this is just doing nothing at the
outsides of the fence so yeah that's
pretty much our look at the cooler
actually this is a very large cooler so
the fins go all the way from over here
to all the way over here and you can see
the thickness is actually in there you
can look at this thickness under the
shroud here so this is a pretty short
card it uses the old style placement for
the PCI Express connector which is fine
because since it's a short card you
shouldn't have too much interference in
terms of hard drive bays or anything
like that uses dual eighty millimeter
fans for cooling as well as there's our
PCI Express 3.0 16 X slot and then up to
four displays no problem to DVI a
full-size DisplayPort and then HDMI so
you can do up to actually it looks like
you're going to do up to three with this
guy one two three or one two three or
one two three so you can do up to triple
monitor no big deal there's the single
crossfire connector so that is up to
two-way crossfire on this particular
card
I think that pretty much wraps it up for
the unboxing portion of this particular
video we are going to be doing a follow
up though on the NCIX comm channel where
we take a look at its performance as
well as its quiet
miss and coolness which I am expecting
both of which to be very very impressive
because if I compare to if I compare
reference cards against sapphires other
aftermarket cooler cards using their
dual X cooler I wish I could find one
right now around here somewhere this one
this one we did some testing comparing
these two reference cards and they just
absolutely destroy them and so it's a
similar kind of design with the pipes
and duel fans and the whatnot in the
hoo-ha don't forget to subscribe - tech
