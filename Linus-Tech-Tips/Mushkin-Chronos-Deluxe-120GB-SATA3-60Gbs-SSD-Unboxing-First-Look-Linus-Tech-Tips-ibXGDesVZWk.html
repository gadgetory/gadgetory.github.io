muskan
it is a SATA 3 tuna 1/2 inch SSD now
comes in a box that's so big that it
could be a three and a half inch SSD
because remember the bigger the box that
comes in the more performance it has
right guys
all right the Chronos SSDs series is a
great leap forward using the SATA 3
protocol to provide six gigabit per
second superhighway for data coupled
with the solid state drives Chronos SSDs
will redefine the word fastest I know I
skipped every other line but you guys
pretty much know what they were gonna
say anyway this one in particular is the
120 gig drive although it is available
in other capacities including a 240 gig
drive and what is special about this
particular drive well I would love to
tell you that but why don't we start
with the unboxing portion first so we
have a two and a half to three and a
half inch adaptor and I've seen this
particular adapter a number of times
with a number of different logos on it
pretty standard adapter you got your
screw holes your other more different
screw holes and then you plug it into
the thing alright we've got the SSD
itself you've got some mounting hardware
you got a couple screws that will screw
into the adapter and then you've got a
whole lot of foam so much ken is not
taking any chances they're they're
making it so you can you can put your
SSD in here you can wrap it up in here
and you could like throw it at the wall
and you could you could be like the
worst the worst courier in the world and
you could kind of go like this and try
to play you know hacky sack with the SSD
and you're gonna pull it out of this box
and there's gonna be no damage to your
safe SSD with an inch of foam on every
side whatsoever
alright so let's pull out the SSD itself
and let's talk specs for a little bit
here so this is a SandForce 2281 drive
which is pretty much the same controller
that is being used in any SandForce SATA
3 SSD at this time but there is a
difference in terms of the quality of
the NAND chips that are used from one
drive to another not to say that some
are more reliable than others but in
terms of the speed especially with
random reads and writes you do get
better performance out of the deluxe
drive which uses toggle meant versus the
regular Chronos which does not so here
you can see the SSD itself is labeled
www.h king calm Kronos save the
three-tailed state drive on the other
side we find some more information such
as look at they give you a firmware
revision right on the right on the drive
itself most guys don't call it which
firmware revision they're using but
looks like they do so this is a 120 gig
SATA 6 gigabits per second as I
mentioned it's available in other
capacities you're gonna find a very
standard interface on the back here
there's you say the three data there's
your SATA power you're gonna have all
your standard mounting holes so a lot of
people have asked me to do round ups of
SATA 3 drives and I will tell you guys
it's kind of unnecessary because I can
pretty much tell you what everything is
so the Chronos deluxe I'll tell you guys
what it is equivalent to its equivalent
to the max I ops from OCZ and it is
equivalent to the wildfire from patriot
in terms of performance yes it will
perform identically to either those
drives so if you see a Chronos that's a
good deal then go ahead and snap it up
you'll know what to compare it to in
terms of pricing thank you for checking
out my unboxing and don't forget to
