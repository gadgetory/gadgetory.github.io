power supply game in a serious way so
this is the jewel 700 watt power supply
and that is Joule the unit of
electricity rather than jeweled the
sparkly thing that goes on ladies and
some men okay so we have an 80 plus
bronze rating on this particular power
supply is a 700 watt unit which makes it
I mean I remember when a 700 watt unit
was like who needs that that's
ridiculous 700 watts who could possibly
ever need 700 us well now 700 watts is
basically like a mid range or sort of
value performance range of wattage so
that's what we're going to be looking at
today let's have a look at what are the
overall features and ratings and
everything else that we might possibly
care about so we've got a full range
input with 99 0.99 active power factor
correction okay that's good dual 12-volt
rails okay we've got a high reliability
thermal controlled nanotech bearing fan
that's good fan can be the difference
between a power supply that I would use
in a power supply I wouldn't use
regardless of how well it performs okay
efficiency up to 86%
Seanie cables connectors support we'll
have a look at that okay we've got over
current protection over voltage
protection under voltage protection
short current short-circuit protection
over power protection and under load
protection so it's got all of the
electrical safeguards that would be
potentially needed in a bad situation
all right
packaging is fairly simple on this
particular power supply unit it's kind
of a no-nonsense approach so we've got
just a you know graphical sleeve that
goes over a plain black box and let's
see how well pack the power supply isn't
here so hmm that's probably okay I guess
so what I would probably do is uh I
would suggest that having a little bit
of foam around the power supply wouldn't
necessarily be a bad idea but it'll
probably arrive okay
if you have any issues muskan has
legendary army support so I'm sure
they'll get you taken care of right away
so here's the power supply itself
let's check the accessories first a lot
of a lot of accessories as I mentioned
this is a value power supply so you've
got a couple of black cable ties we have
some silver screws and we've also got a
standard computer power cable now when
it comes to power supplies I'm a big fan
of the KISS principle that is keep it
simple stupid
and the muskan joule 700 watt definitely
does that so we've got a plain black
finish on it we've got a label that
basically tells you the things you would
potentially want to know about it so
that is how many amps on the respective
rails so you can see either of the
12-volt rails is capable of providing up
to 26 amps okay and that is for a total
of let me see
12 volt combined output is up to 51 amps
so if you were to load up both of those
that is the maximum that you can put on
the 12 volt rail on this power supply so
let's go ahead put this guy over and so
you got nothing on the other side just
your plain black power supply here is
the nanotech fan that is apparently
lubrication free so it uses some kind of
fancy-pants nanotechnology in order to
do that and they claim up to 120
thousand hours mean time between failure
for the fens so which means that this is
an unusual thing it should actually
outlast the power supply which is rated
at 100 thousand hours mean time between
failure so in terms of pre connected
cables this I like because it has only
ones that you will absolutely need it's
got a 24-pin pre connected and it's got
an 8 pin well that is a 4 plus 4 pin and
they slide together unlike some of the
the cheaper one so I don't know if
they're cheaper or more expensive but I
definitely like the slide together
design better so you see you can
separate them like this
but then you don't just clip them
together you actually slide one
connector into the side of the other so
then you make your 8 pin connector that
way and it's much easier to keep them
together when you're trying to
reach somewhere and plug in your a pen
so everything else is modular so it has
a nearly fully modular design so how
let's have a look at what we've got
included in terms of modular cables
looks like we've got one what is this
EPS 12 volt 2 motherboard EPS 12 volt
yeah so we have an additional 8 pin so
if we wanted to plug that in we could
plug that in and we would have well
that's interesting no ground connections
there so I guess this is us since this
is a secondary 8 pin the assumption is
that pretty much no motherboards will
actually require hold on just a minute
ah I get it okay no no no no no no no
okay because it looks like these these
connectors are all standard so oh this
is neat so you can actually plug this in
wherever you want and what it's doing is
it's just splitting there you can see
there's an additional ground and an
additional 12 volt there it's just
splitting them so that this end goes
into the motherboard which is fully
populated in this end because it's only
got so many 12 volts in the standard pin
out that we're using on all of these
outputs then yeah so just splits them
okay so that's neat okay so you've got
an additional 8 pin so you can plug in
fancy-pants some other boards like the
classified or like the Big Bang X power
from MSI that require multiple 8 pin
connectors or well they don't require
them but they can accept them to provide
more power to the CPU soft slot okay
we've got a couple PCI Express
connectors okay so these two go in much
the same fashion wherever you please and
they each have a single cable that
terminates in an 8 pin and a 6 pin PCI
Express power connector the 8 pin is
uses the same sliding design for the
additional 2 pins so you can take those
off or put them on as you see fit there
we go put those back together so you got
two of those
prop 2 to 8 pin and to 6 pin or for 6
pin PCI power connectors all right next
we have only one molex cable so this one
plugs into the end it's nice and long
actually very very long and then it has
four molex and one floppy connector
they're all fairly nicely sleeved
actually that's one of the things
Muskaan's done well on this particular
unit is they're not using a cheapo
low-quality sleeving that's really easy
to see through okay and then finally
we've got some SATA cables so each of
these has four SATA connectors on them
and it looks like yes they are identical
so up to eight SATA connectors can be
attached to the jewel 700 watt power
supply so things Muskaan's done well are
going to be the overall oh yeah I've
looked at the back there you go so this
is typical of a muskan power supply
instead of using that honeycomb shape
that we typically see so often on other
power supplies they've got their cross
hat shape okay we've got a power switch
we've got an input and there is no
voltage selection because it does accept
any input voltage so they've got nice
leaving on this thing you've got lots
and lots of modular cables you can plug
any of the cables into any of these
connectors which is really really nice
the cables aren't super long but so you
might need an extension for your eight
pin if you're running it in a bottom
mounted case that's quite tall but the
24 pin is fine and all the other ones
look good I wouldn't mind it seeing a
couple more molex connectors but you can
always use adapters or use extension
cables to get more of those and the
reality of it is in my personal system
I've only got a single thing connected
via molex so right guess it's not that
big of a deal anymore SATA connectors
are certainly more important so thank
