typically a slow car like say a toyota
cressida that has been modified to be
insanely fast and there's another key
element the best sleepers like this one
from Mighty Car Mods feature no external
modification so potential challengers
would have no way of knowing that it's
capable of chopping them to shreds
eating aforementioned shreds then
pooping them out so inspired by this
concept we grab the nastiest oldest your
great-uncle is still using it for some
reason case that we could find and vowed
to make it smash gains once more meet
Hubert play named plain looks plain
performance here you know that kind of
plane
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description so first we needed
a case and our good friends over at free
geek hooked us up with this and an tech
SX 840 which back in the day was pretty
dope but after almost 15 years of Filth
collection well let's just say it was
perfect opening it up though the insides
actually could have been a lot worse
all things considered I wonder if this
thing has even been opened since shortly
after it passed QC back in 2003 I really
hate that that's a long time ago now
anyway
next order of business was a plan to
pack it full of as much power and water
cooling as we could and because Alex
can't resist an opportunity to fire up
that copy of SolidWorks that they gave
us for just such occasions we created a
model of the case and started virtually
test-fitting our components radiator in
the bottom with vent holes hmm well that
could fit but then we'd be stuck with a
single graphics card unacceptable so we
settled then on a thick triple radiator
in the front
this might seem slightly overkill but
these new core I nine processors run hot
as hell when overclocked
and we wanted to be able to push up this
baby as far as possible time to head
down to the workshop we pulled the
drives then spent about the next half an
hour drilling out rivets with our trusty
bottle of rapid tap ah that's better
I mean who needs ancient mechanical
drives when you can have more room for
cooling time for a test fit then before
we make any irreversible modifications
our pump reservoir position was the
trickiest to figure out at first we
wanted it to go in the bottom but
because of the PCIe slot positioning on
our Asus prime x2 99 deluxe we couldn't
make that work there is some room up top
but that would make sealing the system
more difficult without putting in a fill
port in the top and ruining
our beautiful sleeper aesthetic so
finally we came up with an idea maybe we
could mount it to the fan
I mean sure that's not the greatest for
airflow and it means that we'll have to
be darn careful while drilling into them
but it might be just crazy enough to
work how to mount the radiator though
holes in the front of the case would be
the most obvious solution but stealing
the top radiator mount from a master
case pro/5 would save us some time
so we flattened it out a bit and often
still about a half an inch too thick not
a problem though it's angle grinder man
to the rescue so with the cuts tidied up
it did still interfere slightly with the
motherboard tray rivet so all those came
with the drill and these holes here
should serve us well for mounting the
radiator of course though our troubles
weren't finished and we were still
having some difficulty getting it in due
to these pesky tabs thankfully almost
every problem in life can be solved with
abrasive much better to line up the
screw holes we poked the drill through
the existing holes and gave it a little
spin just to remove some of the paint so
we knew where to drill
next we Center punched where the screws
would be and drilled on through we then
poor-man's tapped them out with some
thumb screws and a lot of love and holy
crap this might actually work
now since the reservoir can't go
anywhere else we had to make some
modifications to this poor fan so we
started small then worked our way up to
the super objects that's always the best
way okay then awesome the reservoirs
mounted but clearly we'll need more
airflow angle grinder to the rescue
again and as though like magic that's
more like it
so with hopefully all of our
modifications to the case finished it
was time to finish it off with a nice
coat of black tape
so at this point we were ready to slap
all the parts in plan out our water
cooling loops and call it a day but then
shortly after the cameras turned off for
the night getting jiggy with it came on
the radio and we realized the soft
tubing we'd planned wasn't big Willy
style so we flip the script and flip the
red extended the res and devised the
plan for a loop sexy and hard enough for
even the biggest willies
so instructions for hard line then
measure cut fill heat Bend check insert
secure rinse and repeat until done Oh
custom hard line water cooling easy as
that after several hours of cable
management man old cases suck for that
we were ready for the final touch-ups so
we disassembled the loop installed the
storage Ram 80 millimeter og case fans
which only got cleaned on the inside to
maintain our sleepers perfect external
fill and then reassembled the loop and
filled it up
so that at this point he put back
together the outside of the case front
panel goes on with double side tape CD
and floppy drives the side panels go
back on and would you look at that it's
still awful and dirty on the outside
leaving anyone without a very keen eye
to dismiss it as old crap but open it up
and holy frig is it beautiful and with
the horses to back it up with an Intel
Core I 970 900 x10 core 64 gigs of ram
RGB of course dual GeForce GTX 1080 s
Samsung 940 pro SSD in a fully custom
water cooling loop we are looking at a
machine that can run with pretty much
anything out there today while saying
both cool and quiet that is if you
disable the rear fan because they're
really really loud ow so that's in the
glory now of Hubert and stay tuned for
Dale because the sleeper PC series is
far from over
so if you're a game developer or a video
editor or you you use both Linux and
Windows one for serious work and one for
gaming whatever the reason is that you
have two computers synergy solves once
and for all the problem of needing to
have two keyboards and two mice to go
with them because it allows you to share
your peripherals between multiple
computers so you won't get confused
anymore they have a basic and a pro
option for synergy with a one-time
payment for features that include copy
and pasting between the computers
dragging and dropping files between
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and more and the best part is that
synergy works cross-platform between
Windows Mac and even Linux so check out
