water cooling guide and the reality of
it is it's too much work and very few
people care so maybe I'll just do sort
of more random blogging about my system
from water cooling upgrades whenever I
do them so step number one for this this
is a full system right now I'm using
quick disconnects because I was
temporarily running a CPU only loop
while I waited for my graphics card to
get a water block so what I'm going to
do first is I'm going to drain the water
out of the system and I will do that by
taking my quick disconnects and just
clipping the zip tie that I have over
the barb here over a bucket making sure
that they're positioned over the bucket
and then basically removing both of the
quick disconnects that's what I'm doing
okay that was it I actually don't need
much of the water drained out because
all I'm gonna do is cut this piece of
tubing cut this piece of tubing put a
full cover block in there with a video
card attached to it and then I'm going
to run the system and refill the res
esses airy okay so I've swapped out to
the old graphics card and swapped in the
new graphics card but in my power
connectors but in my screws so
everything is hunky-dory as far as I can
tell so now all I need to do is measure
this tubing make sure I cut it to the
right length so that it'll look all nice
and be the right length and then I'm
going to slip the top halves of the
compression fittings on to the tubing
put the tubing on the barbs and then
screw in the compression fittings that
was it so now I have taken out the quick
disconnects taking out the extra tubing
and installed the compression fittings
and tubing on my card now if I was
diligent I would have leaked tested this
before powering it on but I'm just gonna
power it on because I'm pretty sure I
did everything right I've done this a
few times after all mind you that kind
of overconfidence is what can get you
burned so don't do that do as I say not
as I do right now the process that I'm
working on is called
bleeding the loop so that is to
that I am trying to get all the bubbles
out so I'm turning it on at the back I
turned it off in the back of Catco way
so I'm turning it on at the back
starting up the system waiting for the
the system to start properly first okay
so I'm waiting for the res to empty and
then I'm refilling it it looks like that
was my last cycle so after that you can
see there's still some bubbles left and
that's gonna last for a while one of the
ways that you can get rid of the bubbles
quicker is you can vary the speed of
your pump to kind of try to dislodge
them you can give the system a little
shake that can help and those are
probably the two main techniques I mean
yeah you can take your tower and you can
like move it around but that's a lot of
hassle so anyway at this point the loop
is filled other than leaving out the
last air bubbles and that's what it
looks like so I'll do a quick tour of
the finished system now that I'm finally
done my upgrade that took</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
