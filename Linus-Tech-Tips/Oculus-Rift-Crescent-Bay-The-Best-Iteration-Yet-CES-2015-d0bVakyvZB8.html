brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx so in the the most unlikely
series of events ever I ended up at the
oculus booth at CES 2015 I definitely
didn't plan to be here at all we're
checking out their Crescent Bay
prototype which is actually kind of
fantastic we're out of the Crystal Cove
and we're into the bay now before i get
into the awesome experience of this
prototype i'm going to talk about the
hardware a little bit unfortunately they
wouldn't talk to me about any screen
improvements but they said it is a
better screen although they did say it
is ninety hurts now instead of 75 and
they wouldn't talk to me about the very
specifics of the headphones but i can
tell you the the visual experience is
quite good i don't think it's one
hundred percent ready yet necessarily as
when you get close to things you can
definitely see the resolution issues but
the screen door seriously bad effect we
had on DK one is basically solved as at
this point now the headphones are
spatial audio headphones and they're
gonna be releasing their spatial audio
sdk for DK to users fairly soon so that
people can start programming audio where
you you drop an audio effects somewhere
in a room and you can hear specifically
where it is cool cool cool so if you're
coaching below it you can tell you below
it etc but these headphones will be
removable on the consumer version the CV
one and there won't be a development kit
version of the Crescent Bay prototype so
you don't have to worry about them not
being removable on this one the
removable headphones will be no big deal
you can strap on pretty much whatever
you want the tracking on Crescent Bay
has gotten a massive massive improvement
and this is where i saw a DK 2 lacking
the most so i'm very happy that they
focused on it they probably realized
that themselves not only have they added
a ton of ir leds including some around
the rim so that you could see the IR
LEDs from the back but also on the back
of your head in a triangle shape so if
you turn completely around it is able to
tell what you're doing it until if you
have your head tilted it can track you
even if you turn around that was a huge
issue with DK too because once you got
slightly out of the box it would
disconnect and once you got a little bit
too low it would disconnect but not only
is is there more tracking our LEDs but
the the framing on the camera is much
wider
vertically and horizontally so to be
able to pick you up if you move out of
frame even more and it was very very
noticeable and a huge improvement
overall now for the experience we
weren't allowed to capture footage of
the screen so I can't show you exactly
what was happening but they had some
demo specifically tuned for Crescent Bay
and it was pretty freaking fantastic I
got Brandon to try it out too because it
was just way too cool they look like a
dinosaur that would come down and
basically each you and they had some
crazy FPS battle scenes where you
constantly feel like something's going
to hit you in the face and both Brandon
and I physically dodged the bullet that
came for us because while presence in DK
one and DK two were quite strong being
able to properly stand up and move
around in the environment is insane
obviously this setup doesn't have full
body tracking so I wasn't able to lift
my hands up and actually move my hands
around but once that comes around gonna
be ridiculous because of how much
improvement the presence was on this
device all right guys I'm super stoked
that i finally got to check out the
oculus booth thank you guys for watching
let me know what you think about the
whole cv1 Crescent Bay experience in the
comments down below thank you to phantom

cool video coming with them soon that I
got to do a little bit of at this booth
stay tuned for more also thank you to
