brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series we're here at the BYOC
sort of a joined intel booth at PAX
Prime with Justin Whitney who's one of
their team members when it comes to SSD
marketing and you guys are talking about
something that actually for my regular
viewers i said was crazy like 24 hours
ago justify this to me explain what this
is come on man to be really honest i
thought it was a little crazy too so
what we're talking about is that we've
got a prototype drive here first time
show never we wanted to we want to come
to pax talk to the press and more
importantly get end-user reaction to
this technology we had a couple of
customers that approached us and said
you know sad a bus is starting to get
saturated the technology use it
stagnating a little bit we're looking
ahead to PCI Express before even get
there can you do any overclocking year
drives how can you tune the performance
and my initial reaction was guys are
insane why why would you adjust the
performance settings and maybe risk
people's data they're like why does it
have to be risky so I mean we took that
customer feedback started making this
kind of skunk works project in our labs
like wow it can be stable let's go show
it up and see what end users reactions
are so show me the tool right here this
is a beta beta feature within the intel
extreme tuning utility called SSD what
can you do to the drive to tweak
performance there's there's really two
settings in here we're looking at the
the controller itself or the ASIC it's
essentially the CPU of the of the drive
and we're also looking at the nan bus
itself in the frequency on that bus so
we've got those two knobs in in the
first instance we can go from 400
megahertz to about 6 600 625 I'm sorry
did you just say that like that's a
50-percent plus overclock yeah that's a
exactly on the on the controller
or that drive ok and then so for the the
nan bus frequency what I what are we
looking at here eighty the stock on it
is 83 megahertz and that goes up to a
hundred okay so you guys are taking a
lot of user feedback your segmenting
people out into kind of like pro gamers
versus modders versus you know even data
center an IT guys who are here at the
show what surprised you most about the
feedback you're getting hey well I had
to pick myself up off of the floor here
in our booth when I found out that we
had three data center guys that had just
gone through this this little clinic we
were doing as and I asked them would you
overclock the drive after what you saw
would you do it they're like oh yeah we
would do it right now and I'm why would
you possibly put your data at risk or
other people's data at risk and they're
like there is no risk for us we're gonna
validate the technology we're going to
stress test it we're going to look at
the the life of the drive and then we're
going to put it in a cache array all the
data is safe behind that here's our cash
overclock that get our performance tune
jack up the the I ops you know the
random I ups on those drives and you
know just roll with it okay so then the
less surprising one I guess is the the
enthusiast gamers and but I mean what
have they been saying so far so far
they're like if there's a knob we want
to turn it please don't limit it let us
push it till it breaks whoa wait that's
your that's your storage Drive why would
do you want OS on there and brick it
they're like well I can always hope you
know I would I would test it out and if
it you know if the dr froze i would
unlock it in if you give me a utility oh
so you want to utility done look yeah so
okay if we give you an unlock utility
then you're okay with it yeah i'll just
reinstall the OS or another end user
jump to the same conclusion as a data
center they would put it into a cash
drive configuration and leave their
their bulk storage alone so what kind of
a performance improvement are we
potentially looking at here you've got a
sssd running on a regular 520 and then
on this prototype you know prototype
flash prototype controller prototype
firmware and prototype utility what are
we looking at here did you mention this
was a prototype drive I think I missed
that part you better clarify it for the
audience yeah this is not a production
part no announcement this is a prototype
what we're really seeing we that the top
score was a from our 520 series drive
the bottom was just the baseline
settings on this prototype and we're
seeing over a ten percent performance
gain but more importantly if you take a
look at the sequential writes there's a
big jump and that's this this prototypes
drives ability to handle incompressible
data is really solid depending on which
controller you're based on you may not
handle incompressible data you know high
bitrate high definition audio video
those kinds of things this Drive handles
all data equally equally well so we saw
that bump immediately then we started
overclocking it random I ups we saw
scores go up at least in this little
clinic here twenty-two percent so some
of the sequential writes we saw go up
eighteen percent overall scores you know
15 18 depends so we're you know we
didn't we didn't push it too far we
wanted it to be stable here and get that
you know that feedback rather than wow I
did it in a brick time out of here but
you know so far so good so I want some
comments under this video because I
think Justin's covered the pros and cons
pretty well at this point two things
number one is guys viewers out there
would you sacrifice the longevity of
your SSD to have more performance let's
say you could get a twenty percent bump
let's just throw that random number out
there would you be willing to sacrifice
that and number two is I guess just a
more a more general um how would you
utilize this would you be comfortable
running your entire system off an
overclocked SSD would you run your OS
often SSD and have all of your saved
games and everything on a secondary hard
drive or would you go with something
like a cache solution like the data
center guys were saying so thank you
very much dustin
has been awesome appreciate it thanks
for coming and checking it out at PAX
first cool man guys don't forget we're
powered here at the show by western
digital Intel thanks it fit and tell
collectively and steelseries we couldn't
have done it without you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
