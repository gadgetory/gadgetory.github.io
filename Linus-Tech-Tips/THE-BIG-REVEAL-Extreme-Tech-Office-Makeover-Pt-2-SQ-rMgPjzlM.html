better Wow the motherboard wall turned
out really cool and that is all thanks
to a blonde and Jake
they painted all these motherboards we
had to get all of these motherboards and
assemble them on this wall somehow I
don't even know how did you guys even
Wow there are they screwed in we glued
most lemon in the screws were just
opposing places we were too lazy to fold
every motherboard for 30 seconds so
they're not actually first structure ah
cool
and you're also the owner of no three
beautiful movie posters by Etzel wrong
panel those are very cool yeah I was
getting no guidance so you put in
something about the size of Kim
Kardashian's ass yes that is exactly
what happened to me don't give out any
guidance Kris don't blame John for that
if this were a movie it would be bad
fortunately it's just a YouTube channel
until skull Canyon Nook features a
sixth-generation
a core i7 processor and Thunderbolt 3
