Samsung C 27 a 750 X now that is not
it's a pretty sort of difficult to
understand name but I'll be explaining
what exactly is so cool and special
about this product over the course of
the unboxing we're just going to get
straight into it
and we are going to break the seal on
this guy and well oh okay well that seal
is broken
this one is oh and a cameraman who is
helping me today he is apparently having
a look at a couple of these logos on the
box here so why don't we go through them
really quickly HDMI is pretty
self-explanatory dual hinge aha dual
hinge so dual hinge allows you to
conveniently position this monitor
either above or to the side of your
laptop very easily
okay USB hub that's fairly
self-explanatory you must be Ethernet
we'll get more into this later USB 3.0
is supported and Wireless so this is a
wireless product so what makes a monitor
Wireless more on that later as well so
let's have a look at the packing and the
physical attributes in case you guys are
wondering about the getup it's game
seven right now
the Canucks are playing against the
Bruins it's on one-nothing rooms right
now but it's only the first period so
there's plenty of time for that to
change and if any of our viewers are our
Boston fans and I guess you might as
well just I'm subscribed down because
you know we're never gonna have any
common ground' ever so yeah get off my
channel pretty much okay there we go wow
this is a remarkably in the monitor
check this out
so this is an LED backlit Full HD LCD
monitor samsung is using every trick in
the book to get the best possible
viewing angles and the highest contrast
ratios out of this particular screen I
mean look how thick that is yeah let me
pull on my iPhone so you guys can see
for comparison how thick it is look at
that and it's actually quite light even
though it is
27 inch full HD 1080p monitor as well I
can quite easily hold this up with one
hand so let's have a look at the dual
hinge design real quick here so there we
go the dual hinge design allows us to
either position it down low
which if you have a notebook next to it
is very convenient means you can much
more easily align the bottom screen of
your notebook at the bottom of the
screen on your notebook with the bottom
of the screen for your monitor but
you've also got another hinge on the
back and also I'll show you how the
hinge at the back works in a second let
me just do that first so the second
hinge at the back allows us to position
it up higher should we so desire like
that so then it's more like a
conventional monitor alright so let's
have a look once again more physical
attributes so the on screen display is
handled right here this is where you can
select your input these are your
navigation buttons power is right here
alright wireless connection is here and
like I said more on that in a moment
let's move around to the side here where
you can see the built in USB 3.0 ports
HDMI in as well as a headphone jack
moving around to the back we have more
stuff so there's our power
there's our USB PC in so you can
actually connect to this monitor via USB
alright LAN as well as VGA in moving
around to the other side we've got a
couple more USB ports so those are USB
2.0 so there's four USB ports total 2
USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 ok few more few
more looks at the overall appearance of
the monitor itself you've got a
beautiful brushed finish on the stand so
can can you really see that here in the
light that we have in this room yeah
good ok very very glossy back to the
monitor itself with the samsung branding
here so you can see how shiny it is
because you can see my connects logo
here in the back of the monitor and all
likely good ok the front of the screen
is using what is my preferred screen
type and that is
a matte screen so that means that you
actually have to build a much higher
quality product in order to achieve
excellent color reproduction on a matte
screen often use glossy screens to make
things look more vibrant whereas with a
matte screen you can't really use that
hack here we have pretty much more of
the same that we saw in the front so
I'll be back in just a moment here guys
to tell you about some of the cool
features in this monitor alright guys so
let's go through the package contents
here we've got our power brick which is
quite small that is to be expected this
is a power efficient LED backlit LCD
monitor we have a USB 3 cable okay we
have a power cord for the power brick we
have a VGA cable just in case you needed
one we also have a disc that you may
actually need it has the users manual as
well as sense on Central Station setup
we have a cleaning cloth and then some
quick set-up guide and other
documentation now this this is where the
magic happens okay so basically there's
two different ways to use this monitor
as your central hub for your PC one is
to connect via USB 3 or USB to USB 2 is
it is backwards compatible with USB 2 so
you connect this guy in here and then
you just plug this into either a USB 3
or a USB 2 port but USB 3 will give you
better performance or you can actually
do this wirelessly and you can connect
to the monitor that is Display land all
wirelessly from your PC to the monitor
so the other let's just go in summary
the main features that this monitor are
the wireless or wired connectivity to
your PC where instead of having a
notebook where you you know you get into
the office and you plug it into a dock
and it's got your peripherals all
connected instead you plug it right into
your monitor or don't even plug it into
your monitor just use this and you can
plug all you of your peripherals into
the built-in USB hub and all of the data
is transmitted that way the other big
features are the dual hinge so that
allows you to bring it right down close
to the
if I can yes there we go right down
close to the table so that it's going to
be more ergonomic to use with a notebook
that the next one is power consumption
so you've got the LED backlight you've
also got a few different eco modes on
the monitor so you can actually just
manually select how much power
consumption you want the monitor to have
versus how much backlight brightness and
things that consume more power you want
it to have and it also has some cool
automatic power savings with respect to
this guy so once you disconnect your PC
from it turns itself off when you
connect your PC to it it turns itself
back on now that is not a completely off
state but it is going to dramatically
reduce the power consumption compared to
having it not off also Samsung claims
this has pretty much the best viewing
angle that they are capable of achieving
as well as excellent color reproduction
this is a truly high-end product from
Samsung it has all the latest bells and
whistles including bells and whistles
that didn't even really exist yet and
