bad news yeah you're fired you're fired
you're gonna have to be fired you're not
allowed to work here anymore Oh bad news
I already quit you're fired
but here it is the world is just gonna
have to wait a little longer than
originally expected for 4k monitors to
dominate the mainstream why well because
gaming ultra-wide just got a little
closer to your price range
the vast from mass drop is a 35 inch 34
40 by 1440 100 Hertz freesync ultra wide
aimed at gamers for a hundred and fifty
dollars less than the one that dropped
3.8 million jaws just nine months ago so
to hit this price did they like out
cheap the Korean brands or did they just
cheap out well I'll tell you who didn't
cheap out Rose will you can check out
their neon kay 85 gaming keyboard with
mechanical switches and m-53 gaming
mouse with up to 4000 dpi sensitivity at
the links below
oh I shouldn't have that strudel so with
the vast mass drop set out to strike the
perfect balance between features and
cost and you can tell by just looking at
it strips of gray anodized aluminum
accent the parts that you can see
interrupted only by a deliberately dim
power LED and the rest is simple black
plastic much of it glossy though for
some reason that I don't care what the
reason is because no reason is good
enough all the i/o is thankfully on the
side of the monitor so you don't have to
go through this every time you want to
plug something in but it's pretty basic
no USB hub no DisplayPort over USB
type-c no HDMI out no magnetic paper
clip holder just a pass-through
headphone jack one DisplayPort 1.2 port
one HDMI 2.0 and two more hdmi 1.4 ports
that actually won't run past 50 Hertz at
native resolution but could be good for
sources like game consoles that run at
lower resolutions or like
picture-in-picture
if you want to fight your way through
the inexplicably horrible on screen
display navigation to be the first
person to use that feature since 1998
ergonomics is where we get our claim in
the video title technically there are
other monitors priced the same as this
one but you'd have to buy a third-party
monitor mount to get the features of the
vast it doesn't swivel but it has 20
degrees of tilt it's got a gas spring
actuated 11 centimeters of height
adjustment and it's even got 90 degrees
of pivot
making it perfect for ultra tall gaming
or for browsing reddit more efficiently
than ever before
but seriously mass drops positioning of
the vast as a gaming display does seem
to be mostly justified it's using a VA
panel boasting 2 millisecond over driven
pixel response times and while compared
to LG's similarly priced gaming ultra
wide it's running at only a hundred
Hertz versus 144 Hertz it's doing so at
a much higher resolution and then
compared to offerings from Asus and Acer
that also run at 34 40 by 1440 you are
giving up
support but you are paying only half as
much so how the hamburgers did mass drop
managed to undercut the big dogs so
handily well their video promoting this
product seems to suggest that it had to
do with choosing the appropriate
technology with the two millisecond
response time and the 100 Hertz refresh
rate of their V a panel from a uo being
and this is a direct quote just as fast
as any TN panel and NS color performance
that's on par with first-rate IPS panels
ok mass drop I love you guys you
sponsored this show you sent me this
dope ass monitor to check out so I
really hate to do this but that is a big
load of crap and in my opinion that
video needs to be pulled your monitor
delivers a pretty great gaming
experience for all the reasons that it
would on paper VA panels including yours
do actually deliver noticeably better
contrast than competing technologies
outside of OLED and they definitely have
better color accuracy and viewing angles
than TN and at this price it's a killer
value but it's pixel response times are
nowhere near a 1 millisecond response
time 240 Hertz TN display like a Seuss's
rog swift PG 258 q no matter how much
overdrive you apply at a hundred Hertz i
mean it's good for a 1440p ultra wide
but it's on the low end of high refresh
rate and a hundred percent coverage of
the sRGB color space does not make it as
color accurate as a premium IPS I'm not
mad because the product is bad it's not
bad in fact it scored very well in our
battery of color and contrast tests
courtesy of the folks over at portrait I
just don't like the way that certain
aspects of it are being positioned as
specifically great for gaming while
others are being bloss Tovar freesync
for example is a super marketing bullet
point but in practical terms running
triple-a titles on AMD's highest end
graphics card today if you can get one
at decent settings / native resolution
you would frequently be below the 49
Hertz minimum refresh rate for a
to refresh and then when that happened
you'd experience stutter leg and tearing
as though you didn't have it at all
so to be clear none of what I just said
prevents me from recommending that you
go buy this product because ignoring the
marketing the vast is arguably the best
bang for the buck gaming ultra-wide on
the market and you know what else is
great and a good value tunnel bear be
easy to use VPN now there are lots of
people that prefer to keep their VPN
subscriptions anonymous and while
cryptocurrencies can help remove the
link between you and your payment none
of them are as secure as honey yes honey
you can buy it with cash it's
untraceable
what are these talking points unlike
crypto currencies with honey you don't
need to convert funds and your various
coin wallets or worry about price
discrepancies or exchange rates over
time the best part is honey can be used
to purchase a one-year tunnel bear
subscription at tunnel bear comm /lt tea
tunnel bear respects your privacy and
loves honey you know knowing our
audience someone is going to actually
ship them honey and they will actually
expect a tunnel bear subscription ID
tunnel bear this is on you guys it's a
great VPN by the way go check it out
anyway thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but it
was awesome hit that like button get
