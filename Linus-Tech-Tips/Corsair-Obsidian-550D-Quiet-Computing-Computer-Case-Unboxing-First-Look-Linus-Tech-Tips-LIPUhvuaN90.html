obsidian 550d let's see what Corsair has
to say for themselves in a billion
different languages on the front sound
damping material silicon mounts on the
fans and hard drive bays - ah - dampe of
course our parser to dampen vibration
you can cover unused fan locations to
further reduce noise rigid steel and
brushed aluminum makes it easy build a
great system you get built in USB 325
inch SSD support etc etc rugged
durability smart features in great looks
let's open her up I'm pretty familiar
with this case because I actually did a
presentation on stage at the NCIX 1st
annual tech fair about the 550d which I
prepped myself for in late the 2 minutes
before of course that was due on stage
and asked me to talk about their case
for them I haven't actually seen the
550d for more than a couple minutes at
CES prior to that so there you go but
now I know what I'm talking about in
time for my actual video which will
persistently be on the interwebs forever
so that's good ok close to or not close
rather on rigid foams not my favorite at
least it's thick it's not that thick
yeah I would have expected a little bit
thicker than that I guess in their
defense that you have a pretty robust
box that's going to keep it from getting
damaged as as much in shipping it can
sometimes happen we've had some poll
we've had some interesting samples
arrived for tech tips we had one case
that didn't use that didn't use a soft
soft foam that arrived with the back
basically like dented in like that it
wasn't from Corsair though don't worry
days ok
there we go let's go ahead and have a
look at this case so it has a very clean
overall aesthetic actually let's start
with with removing the plastic here at
the front because that's going SEC here
let me get you guys
but what Corsair does with their cases
is they they spend money on the
manufacturing where it counts so for
something like their 650d or even the
800 D it's a steel case just fine strong
Steel's good for building things out if
you build bridges out of it for crying
out loud if you can't build a case out
of it then you're probably doing it
wrong but they do a nice aluminum front
bezel that looks very very very sleek so
I personally am a big fan of that right
right so Corsair yes they spend the
money on their cases where it counts so
the front bevel looks outstanding and
then the general rest of the case is
very plain very professional looking and
in line with what we've come to expect
from Corsair products in general so the
back is pretty nondescript you've got
eight PCIe slots though so it is Excel
etx compatible your i/o shield you go to
120 or 140 millimeter fan slot water
cooling holes although I've questioned
the validity of these most people aren't
running external water cooling setups
we've got a sound dampening foam mounted
power supply thing you can go one way or
the other
you've got ha ha this was premiered on
the 800 D someone of course there's now
standard dual 120 millimeter fan
filtering doodads on the bottom there
which is very nice oh look at these
rubber feet these are nice these are
really tall which gives you actually
enough space under the case for some
legitimate airflow down here and they're
made out of a nice soft rubber and look
at these like big l-shaped feet on the
front as well very very nice so that's
nice little touches so that's a lot keep
it from leg flippin just good ok in the
front of the case this is a cool feature
check this out guys so besides the front
microphone headphones reset start
harddrive led power LED and front USB 3
has a cool feature check this out so it
opens from that side
and pick this off which holds in place
the front fan filter cover sound
dampening material here you got an
easily removable filter which comes out
probably somehow but I'm really not oh
oh I think it's magnetic actually yeah
okay here we go
so magnetic front fan filter with dual
120 millimeter fans included so you go
ahead and throw that on there just like
that so ah there that's the side that's
a little bit easier to remove very nice
okay so we'll go ahead and put this back
and put this finally I'm doing it wrong
because I'm just having a lot of trouble
with what is supposed to be the easiest
fan filter ever but it's like - proof
edition there we go so let's go ahead
and put this back and then I will get to
what is actually cool about this so once
you close it what will become fairly
evident is that you can actually open it
from the other side as well so you just
clip it in really firmly and then you
open it from the other side sound
damping material is also present here so
this will help reduce noise a little bit
another cool thing in line with the
sound reduction theme of this case is
the fact that there are actually very
few vent holes section below vent holes
really to speak up in the very front of
the case and there's a reason for that I
mean there's a couple there's the ones
here down the side and there's the ones
here down the other side but the reason
for that is because vent holes in the
front of the case are where a lot of the
noise gets passed to the user so they've
shaped the front bezel like this see how
there's a gap in there sort of not a
very big gap but it's a small gap so
that the air will actually be pulled in
from the back which will reduce the
noise that you hear when the case is
sitting in front of you on the top we
find more sound dampening material in
here you can actually take this off
permanently if you do decide to male
fans here because obviously this solid
piece of solid piece of plastic would
not be very conducive to so yeah its
line is creepy it would not be very
conducive to airflow so you just take
this off and then you have like sort of
a modular interface we've got more
magnetic fan
I'll just take that off when it gets
dirty and go clean it and then that is
what the top of the case will look like
if you opted not to use this although if
you wanted a case that's more airflow
optimized I'd recommend just going one
for 650d or something or three 300
hardly there was 300 R in the first
place instead of mucking up what I
believe is the very clean looking
aesthetic of this one this is taped on
as well for very good reason because
there you go more sound dampening
material more magnetic fan filters and
the option to mount either 120 or 140
140 millimeter fans or what appears to
be like a single and that must be a
single 160 Miller something like that
you guys love to just correct me if I'm
wrong on that one but either way if I
was gonna mount something here I'd
probably go with the the dual dual 140
is just because if the theme is silenced
then you want to make sure that you are
optimizing the build for silence which
means what I would actually do is I
would just leave this on because I like
the I like the stock configuration of
the case okay keeping with their
tool-less overall philosophy they have
brought back the rear buttons so we had
those side clips on the 600 t that
wouldn't have really fit with the clean
look of this case so we use the rear
button in order to release the top panel
you can see lots of thick sound
dampening material on the inside of the
case
that is once again going to reduce the
noise passed to the user I don't know
how many times I can say it about a
silent plant case but it's designed to
be quiet again other side panel covered
in sound dampening material it's great
the cases are coming with this now
because I remember it wasn't that long
ago you had to just buy a case and then
you'd buy like sound dampening kits and
they were like 50 bucks or like a
hundred bucks so now they're just yeah
we'll just throw it in the case and call
it a day and personally as an end user I
appreciate that because it saves me
money on the inside of the case we find
the usual staples for Corsair nice big
CPU cutout so no matter where your CPU
socket happens to be you'll be able to
install your backplate and all that good
stuff
from the back black internal cables and
little things like this so this is going
to
around coarser doesn't want it to
scratch stuff so they go ahead and they
put some foamy plasticy stuff on there
for you and take care of that all-black
internal cables very very clean looking
all black interior hard drive mounting
is done in the form of sleds so you can
either mount your three and a half inch
drives with no tools whatsoever just
using these little tins right here oh
and these are rubber now - those are
nice actually makes anti-vibration thing
going on and you have the option to
either mount your drive in the middle if
you mount a two and a half inch SSD or
on the side that's kind of cool are they
giving you the option okay supports up
to four or five and a quarter inch bays
up to six either 3.5 or 2.5 inch drives
you can completely remove and I'm gonna
need my screwdriver which happens to be
right here you can completely remove
this middle lunch should you have the
desire I mean maybe you want to I don't
know install something like like really
long graphics cards or something I don't
know but hey okay hold on wait for it
give me a sec you know guys I'm gonna
have to figure this out remove there was
just one more screw in the back so you
can actually remove both pages if you
want although you wouldn't really have
too many options in terms of installing
drives but there you go you can should
you so desire if you just want like more
airflow directly onto your graphics card
and you just want to you know bolt an
SSD somewhere and call it a day
in terms of your your boot drive so
let's go ahead and throw that back in
there cuz I think we're done with that
experiment umm right cable routing so
once again introduced with the 800 d
these awesome rubber grommet ii things
that allow you to easily now whoops
everything you want wherever you want it
to go with nice tidy looking cabling
plenty of room at the back so you can
see the motherboard tray is a little bit
recessed but there's tons of room here
to mount your 24 pin cable and whatever
other thick cables lots and lots and
lots of room in the back and more than
enough of these little hooks which are
very actually I would say wouldn't say
more than enough I could
- truffle up here so I can get that up
to the eight pin or four pin a hole
right here and make it nice and tidy but
we have sort of enough then let's say of
these hooks for zap-zap strapping cables
down to make sure that they're nice and
clean on the back so you don't have a
hard time closing the back of the case
let's have a look at what they've
included in terms of accessories
whatnots course it's taped shut lots of
stuff check it out okay so the internal
USB three header is not necessarily
compatible with older boards so they've
given you an adapter to plug into a USB
2 header should be so desired
alright the new boy oh oh
replacement clips for the for the front
if you happen to like break them or
something I guess you know what I better
check yep that's what they are so just
in case you do happen to break them that
saw included for you that's the fan
screws we got some hard drive screws no
those on hard drive screws those are
vibration dampening fan screws more fans
crews hard drive screws power supply
screws optical and SSD screws and
motherboard standoffs there's also of
course the manual really in design
inside and out I think that pretty much
speaks for itself when it comes to
course there's limited track record with
cases but it's been very very good so
far and I think that pretty much covers
it so thank you for checking out our
