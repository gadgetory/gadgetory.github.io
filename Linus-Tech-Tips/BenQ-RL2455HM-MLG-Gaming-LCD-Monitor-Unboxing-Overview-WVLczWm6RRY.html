the Ben qrl 2455 hm this is a bit of an
evolutionary step forward in their
gaming monitor line that takes what was
already good about the HT model and sort
of kicks it up a notch
so for one thing they've added stereo
speakers meaning you can plug them in to
plug this monitor into a console and
you'll have I mean it won't be the best
audio experience in the world but you'll
have some sound from your game and
they'd added dual HDMI inputs so now you
can have it hooked up to your PC and
something like a caiman console at the
same time alternately you can have them
hooked up to a couple different gaming
consoles and easily switch between them
without using a receiver and last but
not least and this is the big selling
point is the fact that it now features
look at that they don't even put it on
the front of the box this is like the
big deal a one millisecond response time
so the rest of the specs of this monitor
are pretty much what you've come to
expect so there's a thousand-to-one
static contrast ratio or twelve million
to one dynamic contrast ratio remember
dynamic contrast ratio is achieved using
things like backlight dimming in order
to make blacks blacker because the way
that LCDs work is there's a back light
shining through an LCD panel so there's
only so much you can do to completely
block out the light it also has a 60
Hertz refresh rate so this is not a 3d
ready model it doesn't have 120 Hertz
refresh rate but the big deal with the
whole response time thing okay that
seemed like a good thing to happen so
any gaming monitor should have low input
lag which is not the same as response
time and is not the same as refresh rate
so the refresh rate is how often the
monitor draws a new image on the screen
every second so 60 Hertz means it's
drawing 60 images every second the input
lag refers to how long it takes the
screen itself to actually receive a
signal from the computer or from the
console device and most gaming monitors
these days should have quite low input
lag and last but not least the response
I'm refers to how much motion blur or
many people refer to it as ghosting but
it's not the same thing but how much
motion blur is on the screen during fast
paced action and that's where this
monitor is going to excel so yes it's a
TN panel that is to say the colors are
not going to be as vibrant or as rich as
something like an IPS or a VA panel but
if you're looking for a crisp image
during high motion this is probably
going to be pretty much the way to go
we're going to put it together here in
just a moment we'll be right back so we
actually didn't have to do much in terms
of disassembly because or in terms of
assembly because the only things that
really go together are the base here
which just uses plastic clips to go into
place so assembly is just a snap get it
ha ha it's a snap yeah and then there's
no screws involved in putting the screen
itself onto the base either you just
snap that into place as well but before
we do that I just wanted to show you
guys the wide variety of different input
options you have with this monitor so
there's your power in there's your audio
line in your headphones out so this
means you can use your monitor as a pass
through there's also your two HDMI
inputs DVI and VGA which has an included
cable but don't worry this isn't like
that one band cue monitor i unboxed
where it only came with a vga cable BenQ
is including a DVI cable the only thing
I would have liked to see a little bit
different on a gaming class monitor is
maybe the inclusion of a DVI and an HDMI
cable rather than a DVI and a VGA cable
just because it's targeted at console
gamers as well as PC gamers who probably
aren't using VGA at this point in time
the overall monitor is pretty slim I
mean it's not the thinnest monitor in
the world by any stretch of the
imagination but they got to get some
electronics in there and some cooling
going on so you can see there's cooling
vents all along the top of the monitor
it is a 1920 by 1080 HD monitor which
makes sense given that it again isn't
expected to be used with consoles and
the way it clips into the base is pretty
straightforward here now you don't have
to use the included base which is a
fairly basic one and doesn't include
anything other than tilt so that just
slides right in there but it also has
base amounts so you could put it on
there we go an LCD arm should you so
desire so there you go that's what the
monitor looks like it's got kind of like
that
you know gaming oriented red racing
stripe thing going on over here now one
of the things that Ben Keys really proud
of with this particular monitor is the
fact that it's the official tournament
monitor of the Intel Extreme Masters now
with that said not everyone plays in
only the Intel Extreme Masters so they
do still have their smart scaling as
well as display mode features which
allow you with the push of a button on
the side here to change the way that
this monitor works to emulate a 19 inch
19 wide 22 inch 22 why then I think 23
wide I can't remember all the different
display modes but the point is that yeah
so 22 wide 23 wide 21.5 wide 19 wide 19
inch and 17 inch because that many
tournaments they're going to have
standardized monitors that you're using
and they're not always going to be 1080p
monitors although they're more common
these days so that way you can sit and
practice on your monitor at home and be
ready for whatever size you're going to
play at at a particular tournament other
than that I think that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
