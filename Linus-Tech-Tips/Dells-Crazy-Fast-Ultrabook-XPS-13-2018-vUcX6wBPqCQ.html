best screen the highest performance and
the best built chassis out of all the
thin and light laptops on the market but
just because you know someone has the
right ingredients doesn't necessarily
mean that they'll put them together
correctly so then is the XPS 13 a
delicious cake well there's only one way
to find out that's not bad
oh well there's some eggshell
this video is brought to you by spectrum

the Dell XPS 13 9370 2018 straddles the
line between playful and professional it
has just a touch of flash especially our
subjectively flippin awesome rose gold
version but manages it without looking
or feeling tacky at all the white
keyboard area accented by carbon fiber
is one of if not the stiffest to ever
come through our labs and apparently it
is extremely resistant to stains with
bill going as far as to say that if you
draw on it in permanent marker it'll
just wipe right off now this was a dry
erase but you know hopefully we'll do a
b-roll shot or something to show it with
a permanent marker now for thin and
light the XPS 13 is a little bit on the
thick side but that hasn't stopped Dell
from giving up on USB type a ports for
some reason to their credit though they
have included three USB type C's two of
which are Thunderbolt 3 external GPU
lovers rejoice and also a headphone port
and a micro SD card reader so for the
next year or two you might be regularly
reaching for the included a to C dongle
but native type C devices are becoming
more and more common all the time now
let's address the video title Intel
allows partners to configure the TDP a
measure of power consumption of their
8th gen core i7 mobile processors and
Dell has gone full throttle on this one
allowing it to draw up to 27 watts and
reach up to 4 gigahertz turbo speeds
which makes this device feel really
snappy over short bursts but when we see
manufacturers push
formants to the limit in compact systems
we often encounter thermal throttling so
how about the XPS 13 well turns out
they've actually done a great job here
under full load it can't quite keep cool
at first briefly throttling an attempt
to stay quiet during short Sprint's but
then when the system realizes that big
things are happening like a long video
export for example the fans kick in to
bring everything under control and the
real world results are impressive our
XPS 13 with the CPU that costs over a
hundred dollars less matched or beat the
competing Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon and
absolutely ran circles around any
notebook with a seventh gen u series
processor but a powerful engine is only
as good as the rubber that meets the
road or the photons that hit the
eyeballs in this case and our model
actually looks really good here too it
sports a 4k 13.3 inch touch display with
HDR support it's exceptionally bright
the colors are amazing and you can
basically have your nose even if yours
is smaller than mine touching the screen
and still not see an individual pixel
there's just one small problem it's a
$400 optional upgrade adding insult to
injury there are only two screen options
and the 1080 one isn't available with
touch I mean we get that bigger numbers
sell better but realistically you don't
actually need 4k on a screen this small
so we want to see a 1080 touch option
for a more modest increase in price that
might make us feel better about the
slightly undersized trackpad this thing
is just okay the surface coating feels
good but I found myself wishing that it
was a little bit taller just like my
wife and having trouble with accuracy
even after playing around with pointer
acceleration settings maybe one solution
to break the mold and experiment with a
slightly taller aspect ratio on the
screen like Microsoft has been doing
that would also give them an easy fix
for the improved but if for being honest
still pretty horrible webcam placement I
mean I know that not everyone uses the
webcam on their laptop a lot but I do
and I'm pretty sure that the people I
call don't want to look up my gargantuan
snout the whole time that they are
talking to me
it even interferes sometimes with
Windows hello facial recognition which
made the inclusion of a fingerprint
sensor in the power button actually that
much more awesome this is sick which
means I guess we're back to good stuff
let's talk about the keyboard it is
really good
Alex prefers the longer travel of the x1
carbon but for me the soft quiet key
strokes manage somehow to not feel mushy
and the short travel allowed me to get
up to nearly my full desktop mechanical
keyboard speed in a matter of minutes
and the speakers are great too
especially for a laptop this size with a
nice clean sound that makes them
well-suited for something like tossing
on some tunes while you're playing cards
with your friends and you can even have
a pretty long game too since this 7 hour
results in our battery life test is
based on a continuous load you should
get through a workday pretty comfortably
without the charger now let's be clear
here there were some negatives in this
video but none of them are anywhere near
deal-breakers and with the first
reasonable config starting at $1,200 the
XPS 13 s price is pretty good with some
caveats a similarly spec tell G Graham
includes a touchscreen has better
battery life and is much lighter but it
falls behind on performance build
quality and Thunderbolt 3 for the 13
inch version so if you're into easy
docking or future expansion for your
notebook that's a big deal so overall
we're giving two recommendations here
one for potential buyers if you're
willing to pay to play the XPS 13
a well-built high-performance and
compact machine and then we also have
one for Dell fix the screen options
there needs to be a cheaper touchscreen
for you guys to be competitive on the
low end and then while you're at it deal
with that webcam placement egg shell in
this otherwise truly delicious
electronic cake really good cake you
know this is really good
the Thermaltake p90 it's an open frame
tempered glass mid tower case that split
up into three compartments for your
graphics card power supply and other
cooling components it's got five
millimeters thick tempered glass side
panels that let you put your system on
display and it's got three different
layouts to make it wall mountable
horizontal line or vertical standing and
it features seven drive bays check it
