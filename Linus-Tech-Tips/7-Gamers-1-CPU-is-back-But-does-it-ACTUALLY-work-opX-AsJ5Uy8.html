from CES 2016 where Kingston the proud
sponsors the original video which you
can check out here had it on display at
their booth and of course I have wasted
no time creating the linus Media Group
land center where the seven gamers one
CPU machine will be powering seven high
powered gaming stations for the pleasure
of the employees here at Linus Media
Group so let's see if anyone wants to
play some games shall we
whether you run a small business or a
billion dollar enterprise Rackspace has
your dedicated storage environments
covered start a conversation with them
at the link in the video description hey
it's Johnny the network guy come on in
play some video games
let's do it all right John you don't
Crysis 3 C what do it who wants to play
video games I didn't ask you Tarun but
okay sure uh it's okay honey you don't
have to
Oh Oh Luke do you have time to play
video games oh wow um okay Vaughn you're
in Wow
yep you're in let's go take hold got
time to play some games yeah you're
fired
cuz you should be busy but actually no
we're gonna go play games now okay come
on what are you guys waiting for let's
go I'll show you to your stations this
is our new and improved boardroom no one
will ever be bored in here again okay so
guys I do not jump down the hole yet
please so this is it this is officially
the first time the seven gamers one CPU
rig has actually had seven gamers
sitting at it and I think the most
notable thing about it probably is the
fact that you guys are each looking at
an FPS number in the top corner
something in the neighborhood of 80 to
90 frames per second so some quick
napkin math would tell us that that is
somewhere between 600 to 700 frames per
second running at medium settings high
details in Crysis 3 at 34 40 by 1440
resolution it is actually working
but of course staring at a wall is not
the ultimate benchmark so I'd like you
guys to all gather around I'm going to
show you how we benchmark Crysis 3 at -
tech tips and we are all going to try
and do the benchmark together
yes that's why I told you not to fall
down the hole Tarin yes I will help you
in fact let's go do it on Teheran
station since he has to go back to the
starting point anything yes its crisis
you're wearing up Oh for crying out loud
Bolton oh no no it doesn't okay everyone
come watch the benchmark run okay
don't stare into the hole just look at
it then you're going to press the
apostrophe key boom that'll start the
benchmark and your FPS numbers will go
away drop do not jump down the hole if
you jump down the hole you will die this
is unique stuff
nope nope because you will need bullets
for when there are actual enemies Terran
that is how games work then you hold
shift to leap across and then you just
kind of stand here and like shoot of
stuff and it's done everyone got that
everyone ready to execute it perfectly
on the first try easy peasy
alright okay ready and three two one
benchmark so left at the first fork
there
can you go right I don't see before this
one I hit it and I did that needs you
okay open up file explorer' we need file
explorer me explorers own amusement I
mean file explorer go to the C Drive
then perhaps are you benchmarks then
open up the Crysis 3 min max average ha
rekt
competition John you should see your GPU
core clock what was it running at while
we were gaming a gigahertz thousand a
thousand one thousand gigahertz put
those in and it's still running it a
thousand thousand megahertz so zero
throttling and what's your GPU
temperature while we were running the
game forty seven forty four what are you
five - forty five very nice so our water
cooling is holding up just fine with
everyone in the mid to high 40 degrees
on the video card very very cool
so now let's fire the game back up and
you guys can just kind of mess around in
game and we're gonna have a look at what
our power consumption is like running
seven legitimate high-end games versus
just some synthetic benchmarks like we
did last time oh what a dick it's not a
multiplayer game can you guys be
slightly more on earth so power
consumption is anywhere from around 1400
watts from the wall to up to 1600 watts
from the wall pretty bananas a nenets so
this is interesting with every VM
running we're hitting every CPU core
pretty much it looks like our CPU clock
speed settles in around three gigahertz
which is actually still a fairly
significant turbo up from the 2.6
gigahertz base clock more interesting
facts another really cool thing if you
want to pop over to your graphics card
tab here is that when we originally ran
this we were having some GPUs show up as
very low link speeds even Gen 1.1 speeds
this time around every single one is
PCIe gen3 8 X which is definitely more
than enough we actually reseated the
graphics cards and got some better
stability that way well how else does
anybody at whoa I've got 200 frames per
second everyone else has steam accounts
that's why I said guys log in to your
steam
right here right kugo sniper when it's
like three on three
Wow can I jump in and point out that at
about 200 to 250 FPS each we are
literally pushing over 1,400 frames per
second and Team Fortress 2 right now Oh
- you're right - you know I know you
guys know Oh somebody hit me with an ass
okay actually it was a sword but I mean
you're dead so it doesn't really make
much of a difference at that point in
time can it turned out to be tearing I
got killed by sarin you're on fire
someone's on fire come on bring your
lies yeah whatever you're you're you're
dead you're dead done already right
you're done already I didn't want my
damage I don't even care I don't even
have to be lay down no no I tried to
hold them I'm sorry guys what's going on
so there you have it we have officially
laid to rest the most common criticisms
of the seven gamers one cpu video first
of all that we didn't actually show
seven gamers gaming on it which has now
been officially done and second that we
called it seven gamers one CPU which
actually I'm going to continue to do in
spite of the fact that there are indeed
two CPUs in the system so that was
pretty fun guys a huge shout out again
to Kingston on raid Intel a sous AMD EK
water blocks case labs
oh sure primo chill provided some tubing
hope I don't miss anyone Acer for
providing all these monitors for making
seven gamers one CPU possible in the
first place
