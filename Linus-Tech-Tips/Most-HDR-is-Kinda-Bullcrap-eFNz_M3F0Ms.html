description here's the problem with HDR
displays right now most of them are
basically not actually HDR the
prevailing opinion out there is that you
need to achieve a peak brightness of
about a thousand nits to really call
something high dynamic range and of
course nice deep blacks to go with them
because a lot of it is about contrast
well all of that changes not today but
at some point in the future with the pro
art PA 32 UX this is the first display
but when it comes out that uses many LED
backlighting so they've got a cutaway
demo over here showing that they've
actually got these little tiny blue LEDs
coming through a quantum dot film on an
IPS display to help this monitor achieve
HDR 10 compliance hlg compliance so
that's what the BBC uses and they are
apparently working on Dolby as well with
a shocking 1,400 nits of peak brightness
and a minimum luminance of point zero
zero three two point zero zero one knits
that is an effective contrast ratio
about 300 times what you would normally
expect and it all comes down to the over
1000 zones of local dimming now to put
that in perspective a really nice full
array back light might have about three
hundred and eighty zones of local
dimming up until now
now the i/o is all covered up here but
we can use the menu to see what it's got
so it's got four hdmi displayport and
Thunderbolt 3 which is a nice thing to
have for Mac users and
be running at 3840 by 2160 60 Hertz with
95% coverage of the DCI p3 colorspace
this thing looks absolutely stunning and
they're targeting content creators and
animators with no ETA for pricing or
availability really to speak of I guess
they learned their lesson from the 4k
144 Hertz gaming monitor which was
delayed for like a year after they said
it was going to be coming there now it's
good
most HDR experiences that I've had have
been kind of cool
this one looks fantastic also a nice
news wanted hurl and we've got the CG 32
which they're billing as a console
gaming monitor for KT 60 Hertz I think
it's got adaptive sing with free sync
which he is actually relevant by the way
to console players now and I guess it's
got these little pads to put your
controller on they've also got a super
ultra wide monitor so this is pretty
similar to Samsung's model so it's 38 40
by 1080 it's 49 inches and runs out a
hundred and forty-four Hertz and then I
actually thought this one was a little
bit more interesting than those so these
portable monitors are getting more and
more popular all the time they run off
of a single USB type-c connection so
that's DisplayPort and power and now
they've got a 1080p model that has
built-in touch functionality so you can
fire up your laptop on a single cable
over to your monitor and you've got a
full second touch screen that you can
just kind of hold up whoop huh I haven't
actually practiced this demo but you
know there you go that you can fold up
and take with you on the go look there
we go a couple other notable features
here are the 45% coverage of the NTSC
color space and the fact that it has a
built-in battery bank so it's 7800
milliamp hours meaning that it doesn't
have to be a drain on your laptop's
battery if you don't want it to be and
you've got it charged ahead of time so
