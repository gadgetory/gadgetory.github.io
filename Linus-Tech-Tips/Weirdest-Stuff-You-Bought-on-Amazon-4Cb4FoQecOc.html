communities toys PC video and here it is
but I took things to a whole new level
and actually ordered 10 of the top non
tech gems I found in my 7000 line excel
sheet some are wicked awesome some ended
up being kind of lame but what they all
have in common is that they were ordered
through the Amazon links under our
videos by someone in our community so
here we go
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description let's start with the
one that most of you are probably
wondering about right off the bat what
book is he reading it's William
Shakespeare's the Empire Strikes Back a
ten-dollar retelling of the epic tale of
the rebellions darkest times in iambic
pentameter too bad it ended up getting
pretty old within a few pages I'm not
really recommended unless you're mostly
interested in it as a shelf dressing
piece that tells everyone who sets foot
in your bathroom what a literary nerd
and Star Wars fan you are all at the
same time our next item looks to be an
absolutely killer value for anyone who
wants to have an extremely clean
butthole this holiday season I mean sure
the a store CB 1000 the day doesn't turn
your toilet into one of those heated
seat padded auto flushing Thrones that
are all over the place in Japan but it
also costs a small fraction as much at a
mere twenty five bucks
requires no power and installs in about
half an hour presto clean butt holes for
all LMG staff thanks Amazon shopper the
next one is I don't know there's really
not much to it it's a bag of 50
microfiber cloths inside the bag you'll
find 50 80 % polyester 20% polyamide
microfiber cloths which are useful for
everything from cleaning your glasses to
cleaning windows to cleaning side pal
kits so they're pretty much for cleaning
stuff but they're only 20 bucks
killer item number 14 is another only
interesting because it's well-priced
items these MTM MO cans are less than 13
bucks hold 30 pounds worth of gear with
a double latch and a loop for a padlock
and are great for storing stuff in the
back of the truck or trailer because
while they're not waterproof
they do have rubber seals making them
fairly water resistant moving on I will
finally acknowledge the item you guys
are actually waiting for here the cold
steel Cutlass machete
these guys make machetes and all kinds
of cool shapes with 1055 carbon steel
anti rust coated blade solid handles and
reasonable prices this one is 25 bucks
if you want to look and feel like a
badass
next time you're clearing brambles on
your uncle's property or whatever item
number six is a really cool
collaborative tool ever wanted to put a
white board up and then gone to buy one
realized holy crap those things are
expensive this sticker is 13 bucks and
it can be cut down to fit anywhere you
want peeled and stuck the one that we
bought is about a foot and a half by six
and a half but they're available in a
bunch of different sizes and it came
with a dry erase marker to boot not a
very good one but hey it's 13 bucks more
bathroom stuff next up is the squatty
potty I'd heard of this one before but
never gotten around to actually buying
one the theory is pretty simple sitting
is a relatively unnatural position for
waste elimination and elevating your
feet helps to achieve a more aligned
colon and a less strained pooping
experience squatty potty's claims
haven't been exhaustively scientifically
tested but enough studies exist of
varying levels of formality to suggest
that at 25 bucks it's not a bad bet
leading us to another bathroom item but
nothing to do with pooping this time
this thing is amazing
and fortunately arrives in very
nondescript packaging the back blade is
a widemouth shaving razor designed with
this special comb assembly specifically
for back shaving it's cheaper than
waxing less painful and hair growing
back thicker from being cut is a myth
that stems from the blunt tops of shaven
hairs appearing more coarse than the
fine tips of newly sprouted hairs only
two items left to go
is he gonna talk about the wicked armor
thing no another book
this one is again not one that I would
buy for practical purposes but a great
gag gift for the kids of some young
parents that you know pretty well do you
want to play with my balls is full of
sexual innuendo in an otherwise mostly
innocent shell that is sure to raise an
eyebrow at your next get-together at 15
bucks it's a pretty expensive 30 seconds
of enjoyment but I've had worse leading
us to by far the coolest item that
showed up on my Amazon report this
medieval style male shirt and coif set
that costs a mere $80 with free shipping
the reviews on Amazon are quick to point
out that if you get pretty physical in
your LARPing it's likely to end up
damaged at some point but for costume
use it's more than suitable and costs a
fraction of what you'd normally pay for
this kind of kit highly recommended as
long as you fall within the recommended
sizes and you don't mind wearing a shirt
that weighs about 21 pounds if you're
