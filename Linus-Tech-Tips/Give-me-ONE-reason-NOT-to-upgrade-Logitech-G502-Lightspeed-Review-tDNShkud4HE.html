was RGB if I'd in 2016 and then got an
upgrade to Logitech's hero sensor in
2018 but through all that time and
certainly since the debut of the G 903
Lightspeed in 2017 g502 fans have been
wondering when logitech would finally
cut the cord on their favorite Mouse and
now that it's here there's really only
one question has Logitech left us any
reason not to go wireless
actually two questions is there any
reason not to check out our sponsor
cable ma just opened up a new factory
and they now guarantee delivery in under
two weeks get 15% off with offer code
may fifteenth before the 27th of May at
the link below
traditionally there have been three main
reasons not to get a wireless mouse so
let's start with the big one
latency does the new wireless g502
introduce any extra delay between moving
the mouse and seeing the response on the
screen that is beyond what you'd get
with the wired version because even a
wire does have some latency now
answering this question is a little
tough for us because we don't have a
warehouse full of the necessary
scientific equipment to quantitatively
measure Mouse latency to the degree that
we'd like what we can test however is
whether or not the average gamer will be
able to tell the difference so we
unleashed our fiercest keyboard warriors
on a high performance gaming rig
outfitted with one wired g502 hero and
one wireless g502 light speed that had
been mocked up to appear wired both of
our mice were configured to the same DPI
and our subjects were instructed to
focus on just one variable latency oh
god that was embarrassing
blame the mouse mouse is the mouse okay
so we have it here on a Lightspeed oh
they're all here over this one for sure
no I wouldn't be able to tell the
difference if you told me they were the
same Mouse I would believe you and I'm
pretty sure even if we had like a 240
Hertz display I would not be able to
tell the difference all right just for
some reason just something about it just
shows nicer to me if you had to guess
which ones which would you we're just
guess like flipping a coin yeah what if
they would have been paired guess I
don't I wouldn't have been able to tell
the difference if I was gonna make a
call I guess it would have to be this
one so that's the wireless mouse oh
that's a wireless mouse and this is the
wired one so then considering these test
results the tournament winning pro
gamers who use logitech wireless mice
and the more quantitative demos that
we've seen from logitech themselves in
the past we're convinced that there is
in fact merit to logitech's claims that
light speeds end-to-end optimized 2.4
gigahertz connection is
indistinguishable from a wired
connection so let's move on because
latency
isn't everything another demerit against
most wireless mice is weight a wireless
mouse is required to carry an onboard
battery making it heavier than its wired
counterpart it's sort of by definition
so if the g502 hero a mouse with the
same shape size buttons and sensor tips
the scales at 121 grams already then how
much would we expect the Lightspeed
version to a now you might think that
that's a trick question and you're
expecting me to tell you haha
it's the same weight but no Logitech has
actually done us one better managing to
make the wireless version seven grams
lighter than its wired predecessors and
this is while still managing up to sixty
hours of gameplay on a single charge of
its quick charging lithium-ion battery
furthermore its power play compatible so
if you get the wireless charging
mousepad you'll never have to think
about charging at all
so then how did they do that turns out
with great difficulty seakeeping the
exact same exterior while redesigning
all of the internals is likely the main
reason that fans had to wait this long
for this mouse because despite their
near identical look apparently the only
component that wasn't altered in some
way was actually the slippy skates on
the bottom of the mouse so while a
typical Mouse gets its structural
integrity from the outer shell this ones
walls had to be cut down to just one
point two millimeters thick so then to
maintain its rigidity logitech used a
lightweight internal endoskeleton this
is a similar design to what they use on
the g pro Wireless then again borrowing
from the G Pro Wireless they added very
subtle but appreciated mechanical spring
button tensioning to the left and right
clicks removing pre-travel and helping
the button recover from a click faster
and with more precision and even like
this is crazy even the scroll wheel was
altered it's lighter but its
manages to feel the same so like yeah
there's a there's a gap there's a cap in
the middle so alright wait and latency
aren't on issues but what about the
third and final Wireless woh price well
unfortunately this is the g502 light
speeds gotcha moment because like the ji
903 and the G Pro Wireless this puppy is
a hundred and fifty US dollars nearly
double the price of its wired cousin
which raises an important question if
you're going to spend that much then is
this the mouse that you want and that
really depends because the thing is for
many gamers even the new g502 with its
seven grams of weight shed is still way
too heavy popular gaming mice from
competitors like final mouse are much
lighter along with being much cheaper
and Logitech themselves has the G Pro
Wireless which is the same price but
only 80 grams with that said if you love
the shape of the g502 you need eleven
programmable buttons and you can't live
without a hyper fast scroll wheel then
this could be the last Mouse that you
ever buy and who knows maybe you can
recoup some of the cost by selling the
wired version that you're probably
already using
speaking of already using if you're not
already using ting then go check them
out ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
