freakin late we spent half an hour
looking for parking so I don't know
hopefully not too much stuff is gone
let's go okay so as we thought they are
holding the live auctioning on the other
side of the warehouse that had been
drywalled over so I'm following the very
helpful signs - oh wow we cannot get
anywhere near it are we only on lot
number two did they just start am i
misunderstanding something
Hey
half an hour late and you don't miss the
party I'm not sure if there's a life
lesson to be learned here
coursers new h 115 i and h 150 i pro a
iOS feature vibrant RGB pump heads
magnetic levitation fans and more check
them out at the link below i don't know
if you guys went through it much but
there's like I kind of really stupid
with really high bids on it I'm kind of
looking like what are you doing I think
people are misunderstanding there was
there was a bin it was a box of stock
heatsinks it had a bit of like 350
dollars on it someone thought they were
CPUs I think hey I just realized
something
I can bid on for you Ed want to buy some
useless crap but you don't need Oh am I
the only one who has a legitimately very
difficult time understanding what he's
saying I think the system broke again it
would be awesome if the online portion
just got shut down for the people who
showed up here like really good thing
did someone really just pay three
thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
for a 3930k based system did that just
happen it's very frustrating the the
system's don't have the brackets cards
listed in them because it's like Best
Buy style merchandising I mean we're not
bidding on any other systems anyway but
5820k processor did that just go for
almost two thousand dollars remember
this is Canadian rupees on top of these
prices like these aren't tax free prices
you got to pay tax and I think it's
about a 15% fee on top for the auktioner
I think people are gonna have a hard
time turning some of these systems into
a Craigslist profit to be perfectly
honest I mean I thought it was bad
yesterday when I was looking through
like we wanted some of those silver
racks there's there's a local Craigslist
seller that just has like everything and
it was like 20 30 bucks less I will give
them credit even though I can't really
understand what he's saying it seems to
get things moving really fast they've
moved
twelve lots already I think we're gonna
have to have a bit of a strategy here
and I think that strategy if we were
smart might have been to not show up
until a little bit later because
everything in the first half of the day
that we had any interest in is probably
not gonna make any sense to buy like
let's have a look at that bin of
Microsoft Office for Mac that I saw
current bid $700 unless you just need
Windows 10 Pro licenses like you can't
flip them for a lot online because
selling Windows 10 licenses online is
just one of those like sketchy things
people aren't willing to pay for pop
they're only worth about a hundred
dollars and remember that's $900 all-in
I don't know what just happened there
was that an RL series BenQ monitor that
just went for $400 what why here's an RL
24:55 on eBay for a hundred and fifty
dollars plus 20 bucks and shipping
somebody just paid five hundred and
twenty five dollars for it that's it no
more YouTube videos auction auction
business get enough to get some food
can't handle this right now
it's amazing how much people pay for
stuff at these things there's just
there's stuff I just I just found on
eBay for a third of what the guy paid a
third I'm getting stressed out in there
Oh stressed out man everything's
expensive madness
- you gotta be kidding me
that this is a lot of five assorted GPU
cooling units heat sinks etc look at
this these are coolers but there's no
there's no i/o bracket on them
there's no card Matthew Matthew you own
yourself thank you oh yeah right that's
why you're leaving right that's why you
guys are out of here
NCIX security technology ow ow this is a
problem cuz like I actually need some of
this stuff like my play button
assortment of motherboards and fans and
other probably broken garbage Wow
fantastic so to their credit there's
some boards in there that like might be
kind of decent there's a z170 board but
this is how it's stored you know I
wouldn't hold my breath that it's
working three EVGA power supplies a 750
GQ a 550 g3 and a 450 just went for $500
550 can I just go to my warehouse and
let go find some and get these guys
to sell it because like you know 121 121
point away if I have one in five ok here
goes a black widow tournament edition
keyboard a hundred and seventy five
dollars
[Laughter]
so there's a dude right there buying all
the keyboards I think I kind of want to
talk to this guy like should we talk to
this guy
hi can I ask you a question
the Corsair k60 keyboard ok so I think
that one was 300 right so did you just
kind of get wrapped up in the excitement
of bidding and stuff yeah he just
doesn't really get about the price I
think people are just here for fun
people aren't necessarily here because
they want to get a deal on computer crap
I mean imagine going in gambling for
example did you go to the casino and you
blow 500 bucks you might get nothing if
you go to an auction and you blow 500
bucks you might get a keyboard I want to
know what people are excited about right
now what is this $700 anti-static work
mats see this is what Linus tech tips is
all about bringing you guys the breaking
stories the stories that break me no no
look at this one is that is that more
than one card please tell me that's more
than one party special bun 1500 bucks
for a 1060 do you think they're gonna
use it for mining or aiming so they only
got through about a hundred lots in the
last 45 minutes which means that we have
potentially like three hours to kill
right now so you can go play some squash
suckas alright did you google how to
play the game
okay so what do we do you're gonna wear
your gloves for the game are you serious
you're driving gloves I'm gonna get my
ass kicked Oh God oh damn okay what'd
you get what'd you get yeah - 250 bucks
Wireless Xbox 360 controller what were
you actually after I got a No

Mouse okay all right you got an Nvidia
shield how much you guys want for the
Nvidia shield I don't know I don't even
know how much these things are worth a
companies just send me there what do I
know

parking-lot deals that's a little JIT
way I just bought this Nvidia shield for
$95 I don't know all right we're back

you guys here that's the channel I built
that's why I'm here

it
but that's my plaque guys I didn't I
didn't realize that this was like a
choice auction here the NCIX tek-tips
channel like you know who I am okay
because I haven't worked here for five
years so what's your channel the what
sorry here can you can eyes can I see so
this is your channel you're running this
well you know what actually if you don't
have one I have two I have one for Linus
tech tips I've got one for tech quickie
I was here to buy this out of
sentimental value but you know what
honestly you could rebadge this really
easily you know what dude
massive showed he was gonna do it but
tell you what take it enjoy it
it's the og plaque which is the one you
should have exactly and it's a lot nicer
than the newer one and you probably know
so okay I'm defeated on the play button
but at least I have this Nvidia shield
that I bought in the parking lot okay
all right thanks dude really appreciate
it it's a really nice gesture you know
what go ahead though you you should have
it put it on your wall and for the rest
of you if you want to make me feel
better
you can go subscribe to my stupid cat
channel so I can get a plaque for that
and then my feelings can feel better
okay I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty
disappointed in our performance here I
can't feel too bad about the play button
though I still feel good that someone
who appreciates it got it and that it
will like mean something to them so I
got my Nvidia shield which it turns out
I should have looked a little closer at
it I believe that's an RMA number so
