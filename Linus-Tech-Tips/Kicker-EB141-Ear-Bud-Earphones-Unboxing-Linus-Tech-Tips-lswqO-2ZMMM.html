cameraman finally decided which earbuds
he's going to buy and I was like okay
well you can't unboxing because i am the
unboxing king so we have the kicker eb
141 earbuds today and these are endorsed
by Bobby Martinez and I wouldn't know
who he is unless there was a picture of
a surfboard on the front which there is
excellent so kickers known generally for
their excellent base in their ear buds
so that is why the cameraman has decided
to go with these ultra comfortable fit
livin loud earbuds so we'll just pull
these out of the box I mean there's not
really much of a point doing an unboxing
because you can clearly see everything
that comes in it but we're gonna do it
anyway so here we go I'll just kind of
pull out the no this is interesting okay
so okay here's a little pouch that says
kicker on it so you can you can d pouch
and repo CH your earbuds whenever you
are not using them there's a little
drawstring thing there so you can like
put them in there it's cool okay then we
have a stereo earbuds owners manual so
did it to do using the memory foam
insert oh these have memory foam inserts
that's pretty cool so it comes with
let's see two different sizes of memory
foam inserts will show you those in a
minute and then it shows you you should
compress them then hold for 30 seconds
in your ear while the foam expands
awesome I'm really glad they cleared
that up for us ok so then there's a
bunch of different languages telling you
to do that so more packaging here we go
let's get the plastic clamshell thing
out of here so there's yeah that's not
really anything ok so we pull the wire
through this little hole and here is the
earbuds ok so it opens up like that here
you can see I was missed oh ok so we
actually have three different sizes of
rubber inserts and then there are
separate to those are the memory foam
inserts so those are actually up at the
very top here so here's the memory foam
ones they're kind of a ugly gray and
they look like
get full of all kinds of delicious ear
wax and bacteria I'm sure you're not
really going to want to use those and
then all right let's have a look at the
earbuds themselves so they've got a
braided cord it's kind of not too long
not too short it's a little long
actually but you should be able to
pretty comfortably go from your head
down to sort of your pocket without too
much to spare now these are quite large
earbuds so here I have the right one so
I'm i would put this in my ear but it
belongs to the cameraman i'm sure he
doesn't want my my ear wax on it but you
can see it's actually quite a large
driver for these earbuds compared to
normal ones and it's a bit of an offset
there so they'll sit in your ears right
about there anyway so I think that's
about all there is to say about these
thank you for checking out my unboxing
on the ev1 for one kicker earbuds</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
