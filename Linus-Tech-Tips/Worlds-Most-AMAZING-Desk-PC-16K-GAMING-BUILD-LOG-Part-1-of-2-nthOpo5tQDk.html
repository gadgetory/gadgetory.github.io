balls-to-the-wall 8k gaming setup that
we created just a few months ago and I'm
also sure that you thought there was no
way that we could Michael Bay that well
you you were wrong very very very very
very very very very very very very very
very very very very wrong meet the 16 K
gaming desk that will be building over
the course of this video 132 million
seven hundred ten thousand four hundred
pixels of pure King awesome
Ek water blocks is all aluminum fluid
gaming lineup offers great water cooling
performance for an affordable price
learn more at the link in the video
description so in theory 16k gaming is
an insane idea but in practice well it's
even more insane than it is in theory
the original concept was actually to
mount everything by straight up buying
16 monitor wall arms off the shelf
bolting some plywood to the warehouse
wall and just raw dogging it but I think
we all know how that would have ended up
conveniently jake has been on a
seemingly unending desk PC bender and
forwarded me some info about yet another
enthusiasts desk PC that even puts the
leanly dko 4 to shame the icy table its
massive modular 3d print customizable
and not to mention it is stuffed with
gamer e beauty but with 16 of acer's 4k
IPS g-sync gaming monitors in the mail
we had to act fast so Jake shot an email
over to the guys that I see table like
yo dawg Sola is there a model of the IC
table that could be used with a 4 by 4
grid of monitors and they were like no
that's insane fans we're in and after
about 80 emails back and forth we were
ready to move forward not only did the
renders of the project look jaw-dropping
but the IC table guys being familiar
with our content offered to personally
drive the massive custom desk all the
way up from Los Angeles to Vancouver and
assemble it for us in our studio
presumably to keep it from being dropped
you need to 100 our silent Edition
that's all right that's the only one we
own now typically the icy table comes in
a lot more pieces than we receives but
to save on time
the Siberian cyber guys did some
pre-assembly and saving on time was
important because as you can imagine
mounting and aligning 16 monitors takes
just a little bit of time but I'll come
back to that later so we started off
with the two large legs of the desk that
each contain a modular drawer that
houses a computer cooling storage or
really anything you want we went with a
computer on the left and actually not
much on the other side we just sort of
stuffed cables in there moving on the
bottom cable routing tray got screwed in
followed by the upper one then things
started to get really exciting they
whipped out the king of the net or t-con
as they call it for short this is their
modular system cage kind of like the
skeleton of a typical case and it can
hold up to an e ATX board quad dual slot
GPUs multiple SSDs the works so on our
first attempt we equipped it with an
Asus maximum eight extreme assembly with
a 7700 K but we actually ended up
running into pci express lane
limitations so we brought out the big
guns a rampage v Edition ten with a
sixty nine hundred K 32 gigs of Corsair
LTX ddr4 memory a knock to a 10 HD 15
and the most important part of this
build the four quad row P 5000 graphics
cards graciously provided by Nvidia
coupled with their quad row sync to card
this is the secret sauce that will
enable us to use all of these monitors
as a single screen with a technology
that Nvidia calls mosaic powering all of
this is Corsairs behemoth ax 1500 i with
stock table
for now except for a single PCIe power
that definitely didn't ship separately
because Jake screwed up our cable mod
order anyway with our system built twice
it's time to focus on the monitors step
one a fix the four cross beams that will
each hold four of our screens the IC
table guys actually repurpose some flat
mount TV wall brackets on the back of
the desk for structural support and to
help us route the 32 cables necessary
for all of the panels but before we can
even get to cabling we need to unbox and
mount some monitors each 27-inch 4k
gaming display gets its own super beefy
3-axis vase alarm that can also tilt and
rotate each of them must weigh about 5
pounds but I guess I shouldn't be
complaining about solid build quality
this was no doubt the longest part of
the process but we finally managed to
get all of them mounted before the end
of the day and finished off by sliding
the t-con into its drawer we can mostly
ignore the fact that most of the
monitors needed to be taken off one by
one to align the mounts the IC table
guides I got to give them props they
assure me they've never built a desk on
the scale before but the straight
precision made it seem like they've done
it a thousand times time to power it on
now then right ah well it was about that
time that we realized that several of
our displays were aloft to 1024 by 768
resolution a far cry from 4k and some of
them weren't lighting up at all well our
generic 25-foot DisplayPort cables seem
to be the culprit and until new ones
arrived we are stuck at a dead end so
here is where the project stands
literally
and like ten feet tall so stay tuned for
our final tour of the finished set up
after what hopefully won't be a month of
troubleshooting in part two ting is the
mobile carrier that's focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction when you have your phone
plan through ting if you call ting you
will not speak to a robot or an
automated phone tree you will get put
through directly to a person and somehow
they managed to achieve this level of
customer service without bloated cell
phone plans that charge their customers
a whole bunch of money because the
average ting bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device so why not find out if
you'd save money on ting by going to
Linus ENCOM and trying out their savings
calculator you enter your last few bills
and how much you pay for your current
service and it spits out whether you'd
save money on ting and if you decide to
switch ting will actually cover 25% of
your contract cancellation fee up to $75
so take advantage of their lower data
rates than ever by signing up over at
Linus ENCOM and when you use our link
you'll get 25 bucks in service credit or
towards a new device so thanks for
