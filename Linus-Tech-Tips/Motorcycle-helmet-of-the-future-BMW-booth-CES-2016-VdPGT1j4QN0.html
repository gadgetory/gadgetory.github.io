brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful so behind me BMWs running a
pretty cool dental where they let you
get on to one of their motorbikes and
you got some fans blowing on you and
you're wearing this very very
interesting connected helmet accessory
that is supposed to make the riding
experience more enjoyable and safer
so I'm actually holding one right now
this is a very early prototype device
and the way that it works is pretty
freakin cool so we'll start at the back
where they've got a single rear-facing
camera right now this one doesn't do a
whole lot but in the future you would be
able to use this for say for example
oncoming car detection a blind spot
checking and a number of other fantastic
features even things like keeping track
of where other riders in your group are
in indicating if someone is falling
behind behind you at the little hatch in
the back they've got a spot for two
batteries in the prototype right now
runs for about six hours off of those
two batteries the USB ports back there
are for development purposes and it's
unclear as to whether or not that would
end up in the finished product so now
let's move around to the front we find
yet another camera this one is an
integrated action cam so you can go
ahead and just flip a switch on the bike
and start recording footage of your ride
I don't know anything about the quality
of the camera at this time and I suspect
BMW doesn't either because like I said
this is a prototype but having the
ability to record action cam footage
directly from the point of view of the
rider without having a bulky thing
attached to your head is something that
I know more than a few people will be
interested in but of course the real
magic comes right in front of the riders
eyes so that right there is an I mean
they're saying fully transparent nothing
is fully transparent even the most
perfect glass in the world is not 100%
light transmission but boy is it ever
close to the naked eye so this uses a
small projector to the side of the right
eye of the rider and then the light
reflects internally in the glass to
project an image out in front of the
rider directly in front of their eye
unlike some of the other smart helmets
out there it puts it really right in the
field of view of the rider which is
which
supposedly okay I'm going to do the demo
in a minute here because it's not
distracting in any way but you don't
have to look down at it and look up
meaning that you don't have to refocus
your eyes and you don't have to take
your eyes away from the road the chin
bar comes up and I guess it's time for
us to helm it up and get this puppy
going okay so that was a pretty cool
experience it was a little unnatural
sitting on a bike watching the road
curve in front of me and having these
wind blowers blowing air in my face and
not being able to lean and not having
the throttle do anything but that
doesn't take away from some of the
really really cool stuff about the demo
so first of all you've got your
speedometer right out in front of you
without having to look down for it the
way that it projects the image in front
of you rather than having it right close
to your face so that you don't have to
refocus your eyes is working pretty darn
well so far the fact that it's using the
camera to recognize things like changing
speed limits things like construction
zones really cool the turn-by-turn
navigation being on the screen also very
cool this is all functionality that I
would absolutely love to have right now
today now it's not perfect the display
is still mono color there's just there's
just green text but they've got it
working pretty well even in bright
conditions which is great I think the
speaker still needs some tuning so while
they're there so you can actually accept
or reject phone calls with the little
toggle on the bike and you could listen
to music with them I think they're going
to have to find the right balance
between isolating the noise around the
rider and making sure that the rider is
still safe while being able to maintain
a call and I guess other than that
there's only two other things that
bummed me out
I don't own a bike that works with it
yet and it looks like it's going to be a
closed ecosystem where the helmet
connects to the bike via a proprietary
connection and the bike pairs to your
phone via bluetooth but I mean who knows
maybe that could change in the near
future in terms of what bike I'm using
and number two is it's a few years
before we're going to see a final
version of this product for sure but I
know that I for one I'm definitely
looking forward to it so don't miss any
