at the cooler master hyper 212 Plus this
is a very popular value heatsink because
it provides nearly the performance of
much more expensive heat sinks it has a
wide range of compatibility including
core i7 Core i5 core i3 and a m3 so it
fits on basically anything and it also
features some traditionally more
expensive high-end features like heat
pipe direct touch as well as a 120
millimeter fan and in addition to that
it also works with a dual fan in
push-pull so you can you can really load
this thing up like you can't really do
with a lot of lower end heat sinks in
this sort of a price range so it didn't
look like there was a seal on here but
it turns out that there is and I'm gonna
have to get like a key or something to
break the seal you know I really should
have a knight on hand ahead of time for
doing these but you know what I'm just
gonna peel the sticker off that would
work better yes there we go that worked
out really well for me okay so see what
we're gonna find inside of the box first
we will find a plastic clamshell style
packaging okay and then let's see what
we got in here in terms of accessories
so there we go alright so first thing we
find a multi backplate
so this backplate is compatible with a
and three as well as LGA 775 11 56 and
1366 it has all the necessary holes and
you can see from the way that they lift
it up that is how they get compatibility
with both Intel and AMD because with
Intel this will sit flush with the back
or it'll have to lift up over the 1366
backplate but with AMD it actually has a
significantly larger backplate that it
has - oh no wait no I guess with AMD
they're not even oh this is kind of ok
now I'm a little bit confused I'm not
going to pretend to know how this mounts
because it looks like there's like some
kind of a sticker backing on the back
here ok forget it alright moving forward
we have more accessories including an
instruction manual which is tucked into
the back of the little phone
so I'll go ahead and pull out the
instruction manual first maybe maybe on
camera I can figure out exactly how that
backplate work so you wow this is like
huge okay first of all there's your
warranty information slip okay so that's
gonna tell you all about the warranty
and a bunch of different languages Wow
look that's a lot of different languages
it's like 9 on each side it even has
Serbian and Turkish awesome I love it
you can tell a company is is properly
international when you know I mean here
same thing here's our instruction guide
wow that is like everything check this
out
doo doo doo doo doo doo and then Oh on
the other side all these different
languages ok so the English one says how
do we do this oh I was right the first
time it looks like for LGA 1156 the
backplate actually lifts up off the back
okay whereas for AMD we're actually
using the backplate looking thing on
yeah we flip it around the other way
okay I get it so for AMD you put it on
this way for Intel you put it on this
way yes there we go
figured it out awesome ok so inside here
we're gonna find all of the other
mounting hardware that we need including
the hold-down for the front so you can I
mean this is very obvious you can see
this is for AMD did that's for Intel and
then these can be moved back and forth
I'm not sure if they slide or if you
have to actually take them out I can't
tell but these will actually move in and
out depending which Intel you are using
7 7 5 11 56 or 1366 very ingenious hold
down this looks like some kind of fan
mount yep alright and then in here we'll
find ya the rest of the hardware I'm not
going to go and pull out all these
screws I don't want to lose them but
that's all the other stuff you'll need
as well as some cooler master thermal
paste nice of them to include that for
you alright ok so let's have a look at
the heat pipe cooler itself so the fan
is free
oh yeah I get it okay so these
additional clips here are they even
include the clips for you so you can put
these on either side and then you can
attach your second fan right out of the
box if you have another fan and you have
four mounting screws for it that's
terrific
okay so as I mentioned before this is a
heat pipe direct touch cooler so that
means the heat pipes are all flattened
along the bottom so they actually do
make direct contact with your CPU I
wouldn't be doing this right if I didn't
do the obligatory shininess shot so you
can see that they are quite shiny and
the surface does appear to be quite flat
but really eyeballing it is not very
useful it comes down to performance data
and the hyper is a very good performer
for the money so oh yeah which I should
mention this there are four heat pipes
and they do go up both sides of the
cooler okay and you can see that they
come out the top here it's 120
millimeters big and the fan is actually
kind of unique looking this is this is a
fan blade shape that I haven't really
seen before you see how it's kind of
like a wavy shape rather than a more
straight swept blade so that's kind of
nice too I've heard that this cooler is
actually quite silent but I don't
actually have somewhere to hook it up
right now I think that pretty much
concludes everything I wanted to
demonstrate about the hyper 212 plus so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look and I'm just going to
sort of give you some more angles here
to check it out there's your cooler
master logo on the top thank you for
checking out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
