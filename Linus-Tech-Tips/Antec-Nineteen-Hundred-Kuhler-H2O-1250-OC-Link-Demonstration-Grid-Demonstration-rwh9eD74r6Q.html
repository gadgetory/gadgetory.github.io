powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM hey guys we're here at the an Tech
booth just checking out their 1900 this
thing is massive it's so big it has a
big basement at the bottom with all the
hard drive options one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve is I think that's correct twelve
plus an SSDs squeeze tray this one and
while these are to list this one is
seriously to list because you just push
the SSD in there or two and a half inch
hard drive and it will squeeze it in
place you don't actually have to even
screw it into a removable tray like this
which is very cool now you might notice
a few other things that I have here I'm
going to continue on the case soon but
first I want to go over their pump I'm
gonna let you guys wonder what the heck
is going on here for a second while I
put it in the top and show you how much
space is actually in this case so as you
can see the radiator just kind of
disappears because there's an inset in
the top where you can actually have
radiators or fans and they kind of
disappear in the case which is very cool
now to explain what the heck is going on
with this guy
not quite yet we're gonna jump down here
just to troll you guys a little bit this
light right here as you can see is not
on but while it's in your case will be
representative of the temperature of
your CPU so it's white if there's
nothing really going on and it's red if
your CPU is about to explode which is
nice because if you have a window on
your case like the 1900 you can
constantly see if you're gonna have any
problems I know some people don't have
monitoring running while they're in
games or other things so that could help
you now to explain why this is so small
and to explain why this is so big they
have moved the pump from on top of the
CPU block and moved it to on top of the
fans as you can see there's water
cooling tubing running to these
individual pumps I wanted to show you
this one especially because they have
dual pumps this is going to be very
interesting I haven't seen anything like
this before and I want to see how it
performs although it's not set up here
I'm going to be getting a sample at some
point and we will test it on our thermal
test bench this thing is very very cool
it's cool to see an tech innovating in
this style and I'm very very happy to
see that they've done this now this is
going to be a feat of victory if b-roll
can actually find this
but in there you can see there's some
hard fins that actually helps tunnel the
air I hope we can get this that actually
helps tunnel the air so that goes
through a column through the radiator as
many of you may know static pressure is
very important for pushing air through
fans and that will help your overall
static pressure very very cool thing
they've done here other than that that's
pretty much it for the cooler so I'm
gonna move on sorry about that guys we
got cut off there now you might notice
that I have two power supplies in the
system these are at different wattages
but they're still totally works
these are OC link capable power supplies
and with this rubber grommet here they
are perfect perfect for this
demonstration this case works great for
it these with OC link you can link two
power supplies together and get the
power of additional wattage and
redundancy at the same time so if you
have both these power supplies in your
system while that may be a little bit
ridiculous you can actually feed
everything to your computer so you can
have the combined wattage of both those
systems which is insane I don't know
anyone literally I don't know anyone who
will use that much wattage but to have
those options is kind of cool and that
shows off another feature about the case
I know this is very multiple reviews all
at once but the it can have two power
supplies in the case now another thing
if we go up you'll notice that there's
green features at the back of this case
also the bezel around the front is also
green this green matches very very well
with the green LED lighting on 780 and
and stock 770's as well as Titan so if
you have a stock cooler on any of those
cards this case will go incredibly
incredibly well with it they're thinking
about releasing other color options for
this case that will be aftermarket so
you can replace the stuff in it like
these the rubber grommets not rubber
grommets the the things that you put
your screws through I can't think of it
right now but it's not a big deal right
here to just have it color code with
your case so that and the front we're
just gonna scoot over to the front here
real quick right over here b-roll to the
front of the case there we go you can
change this as well potentially they're
not sure if they're gonna do that yet
now just to cover the front of the case
there's very beefy power and reset
buttons which are nice to see so you
won't accidentally press it for USB 3.0
front audio headers and 2 USB 2.0 this
case is huge these power supplies are
awesome and this cooler is very
innovative now we're going to bounce
back here
something completely new this is the
Antec HCP Platinum grid this brings
digital power to the anti-gay CCTV
Platinum lineup so if we pull up here
you can see this is their UI that
they're going to be releasing it's in
very very very early beta potentially
alpha he said beta but I'm thinking this
is more alpha considering many parts of
it don't actually work so I'm not going
to demo it but this is what it's going
to look like it will be ready when this
power supply is actually released which
if I remember correctly it's going to be
somewhere around q4 but this thing is
great I love digital power I love being
able to view you eyes on my computer of
what my power supply is doing mainly
because of this right here I love being
able to see what efficiency my power
supply is currently running at power
supplies for the longest time have been
fairly ignored for monitoring as they
have been hard to monitor but now with
with header plugs on the power supply
that go-to USB headers on the
motherboard you can view what's actually
going on with your power supply this is
awesome thank you for watching this and
thank you for watching all of our
