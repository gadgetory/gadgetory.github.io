the azza genesis 9000 and this font is
illegible this could be a P or a D this
could be a Q and these could all be used
so this could be like the Jetta says Q
it's really too bad they didn't call it
the 9001 because then it could be over
9000 and everyone would love that
of course okay so let's move right along
then our ATX this is a little bit
different reversible ATX the ATX
motherboard can be rotated 180 degrees
so we're going to show you that once we
open it up vertical air vertical airflow
designed to provide maximum cooling
performance heat does naturally rise
although I think they've okay yeah no
maybe the color coding is correct so the
heat goes like this up through the case
as opposed to through the front and out
the back like a standard ATX design dual
PSU compatible you can install power
supply either in the front or the back
of the bottom of the case easy swap
drives up to a 480 millimeter radiator
is supported which is very cool so you
can put a quadrat in here no problem
screwless drive locks to easy swap trays
for easy to listen solution without
removing the side panel to 120
millimeter fans at the side to provide
excellent cooling for the hard drives
vertical air we've talked about this a -
140 s at the bottom - taking cool air
look at this they actually put the
patent number right on the box about how
the power supply can either be at the
front or the rear supports up to 400
millimeter graphics cards that looks
like a s60 990 in there so that's about
as long as it gets these days reversible
motherboard tray 2 by 230 top fan
supports water cooling radiators up to
480 millimeters so let's go through the
specs on the outside of the box really
quickly before we open this up I did XL
ATX the ATX full ATX micro ATX you know
what I think most of this can be covered
once we open er up so so let's talk
packing material it's using a hard foam
rather than a soft foam which isn't my
favorite however they are using a double
corrugated box which is good and they
are using like two inches of packing
material on the corners with more than
an inch on the top and the bottom so
what that means is it's extremely
durable
however in the event that it did break
maybe it's loaded up with a 480 ml rad
and all this other hardware then the
structural integrity would be gone
however ours arrived okay so take from
that what you will
now I criticize the phone but there
comes a point where you actually make it
like rigid enough that it probably
actually wouldn't break like check this
out
okay broke but that's what it took so
trust me it's strong moving right along
to the Genesis 9000 this is the white
version there's actually a black version
as well so the white version is white
and blue and the black version is black
and red now there's a lot of stuff about
this thing that we have to cover just on
the outside alone so why don't we start
at the front because that seems like a
natural place to start so we've got a
couple thumb screws here this is going
to give you access if you have a
screwdriver which I will go get now to
the front power supply mounting option
and then from the back there will be an
additional rear power supply mounting
option and right now honestly I am just
so stalling for time while I go find the
screwdriver
alright so let's open this bad boy up
and let's find an appropriate sized
Phillips head there we go all year
powertools wow those are some beastly
thumbscrews we got going on here they
are very serious about this staying in
place so let's see okay cool this
apparently came out so there you go
there's your standard ATX power supply
mounting as well as a built-in cable so
that you can easily pull out the power
supply in without without any
interference there so it would be
exhausting from the front of the case
through the mesh here and then you can
also see I yes this is good you can see
from the front how the air flow
structure in this case actually works
because there's a filter here right
there and you can see that all the air
pretty much comes up through the bottom
of the case using these vents along the
side right here so that's why it's
raised a couple of inches off the ground
so that it's actually going to have
access to air from there which isn't to
say that you can't get any air flow
going from the front because you got
nine five and a quarter inch bays that
are all mesh and all filtered and are
easily removable just like that and then
you've got perforated panels behind them
although you could completely remove
those anyway alright let's move along to
the top so up here got a couple
different things you got your power and
your reset you got a fan LED switch I
love these because that way you can keep
your fans on but actually not have the
computer be bright you've got your power
as well as harddrive indicator LEDs
eSATA 2 USB 2 front audio and 2 USB 3
ports so that's pretty much all the
port's that you could need now I would
have liked to see a slightly less
restrictive grille on the top so you can
see that there's ventilation holes here
this is where that quadruple radiator is
going to go if you so desire and let's
just go ahead and remove this so we'll
show you guys the whole process of
taking this apart again we've got some
serious business thumbscrews going on
here and I just got to do two more
all right they have done a lot of custom
stuff for this case though I can say
that much I mean this is this is not
this is not your standard cookie cutter
om case going on here alright so there's
the LED strips up at the top remember
they're red on the black version here is
where all the fans are plugged into the
integrated fan LED controller doodad
right there
look like there's an actual fan control
top which is kind of a shame that would
be a that would be kind of perfect
actually here's those dual 160
millimeter fans at the top and you can
see that there's lots of other fan holes
lots of other mounting options for up to
that quadruple 120 millimeter radiator
and for 103 millimeter fans that you can
install at the top of the case since
we're at the back you can see that the
motherboard tray is an inverted ATX
right now this handle right here is for
the removable motherboard tray however
that can be rotated 180 degrees should
you see fit now personally I'm not a
huge advocate of the whole removable
motherboard tray thing because I find it
to be more of an impediment to cable
management than a convenience factor for
me however if it has a useful purpose
such as allowing me to rotate the
motherboard tray and build my system the
way I want to build it then we're having
a different conversation and to figure
out how this comes off off camera at any
rate there's the other power supply
mounting hole here is the pass-through
for that front power supply so you would
actually plug in two power cords if you
had dual power supplies which makes
sense there's your 120 millimeter back
cooling fan which you could use for an
additional 120 mil rad and there you got
nine PCI expansion slots for XL ATX
compatibility with even some of the
biggest boards that I've seen on this
side you've got two 120 millimeter fans
for your drives and on this side wow you
have room for two 120 millimeter fans
for your drys you've also got a what
looks like sort of a filtered mesh but
it's actually just two different kinds
of mesh layered on top of each other as
well as a small window
so let's go ahead and get this baby
opened up so we do have to remove the
handle from the back in order to pull
the motherboard tray out which is sort
of an oddity to me but there's also a
few more thumb screws here that need to
be removed before we can remove the
motherboard tray so we're going to take
these out and we'll show you the
internals before we flip it around so
okay we took this sorry we took this
side panel off off-camera so the side
panel looks to be reversible because see
the holes are in exactly the same place
on the other side this is the same this
is the same so you should in theory be
able to switch them to either side that
you prefer hence the reason that both of
them have those cutouts for the
120-millimeter fans also you can tell
from the way it bulges and the way that
the five and a quarter inch base here
are recessed a little bit that you would
have no difficulty installing your
standard 25 millimeter 120mm fans on the
side here so there yes it's free now so
let's go ahead and turn it around here
we go
this is a beastly case it's really big I
mean it's not big like cosmos too big
which was sort of ludicrous but it's big
like this is a really big case big and
look at all these screws we've removed
from it just to like open it okay so on
the inside here we find two 120mm fans
pre-installed we find the others don't
worry there's like a plastic coating on
this protecting it so it's actually a
lot more see-through than it first
appeared to be and this is the like dual
layer mesh I'm talking about where this
looks like fan filter and the other
layer looks like mess so you could
probably remove it if you wanted to if
you wanted to see through it a little
bit better which I personally would be
down for it
and now we are finally inside the beast
so few things here there are all of the
tool is five and a quarter inch bays
some of which as you can see have been
converted to three and a half inch bays
so we're going to have to have a look
from the front and see how exactly that
works so let's say starting about here
and let's go ahead and remove these
okay so some of these are to lists and
look like they go in on Rails to a
backplane however I don't see an oh yes
aha so you do have to do that okay so
there it comes with five of these so you
can mount a three and a half inch drive
a two and a half inch drive or a five
and a quarter inch drive and then slide
it in on the included rails and it to
lessly goes it now you can actually
screw it in there are screw holes and
you can reposition these backplane
doodads should you see fit so these guys
right here
sorry guys we're having some microphone
issues today so these are movable
anywhere where there are mounting holes
for them so you can make your hotspot
bays wherever you see fit now these are
good for three and a half inch to a half
inch devices it has five and a quarter
inch holes but because it'll sort of
change the spacing a little bit you
wouldn't actually be able to install a
five and a quarter inch of ice in it and
they're not threaded so we don't think
you could actually screw something into
it although it could be like self
tapping screws or something hi Denny
right we're gonna go ahead and slide
this back in just to show you guys sorry
I got my head totally under way here but
just show you guys how the tool is drive
enclosure device works so you just pull
that to pull it out and then it's all
good in the hood okay moving right along
this right here appears to be graphics
card support of some sort it's not the
kind of thing I would typically use so
I'm not going to go too far into it most
of the time the encounters I've had with
these support structures is that they're
probably not something that you actually
want to use however some people like
them so you can see actually goes in
this way that's where that extra screw
we found was from so that must have
fallen out which I don't know if that
would be related to the packing
materials or anything like that but at
any rate that's how it goes in so let's
just kind of put that in so you can
visualize this what that does is it
supports the cards you can move them
around
wherever you want so you can give the
cards as much or as little support as
you want you just loosen this with a
screwdriver not with your hands and then
remember guys the motherboard tray is
kind of upside down here so you have to
bear that in mind while you're while
you're visualizing so there you go we
got around wherever you want and there
is a piece on the back that makes sure
that the screw doesn't just sort of
randomly fall out at any given time and
keeps it in place and we'll be back in a
second here guys which brings us to why
I usually don't use these I find they're
just sort of a little bit more trouble
than they're then they're worth for me
okay so the rest of the internal layout
is pretty straightforward you got your
cable management holes for your power
supplies which can be located okay let's
go ahead and turn this back around so
that you guys can see so power supplies
can be here or here and based on with
the positioning of these fans I would
probably recommend putting it in the
front in the stock configuration however
if you turn this around then we might be
having a bit of a different conversation
and then in terms of cable management
space there is lots of the back so you
can see they've done some of the cable
management for you already with some of
the fans as well as the front panel
connectors but there's ample room back
here for things like your 24-pin
connector anything going up to your
drives I wish this sort of had some
testers at some point but that's not the
end of the world either here you've got
lots of cable management holes as well
you got this one for your 8 pin or 8
pins or 4 pin plus a pin or whatever it
is that your motherboard happens to use
and now for the most exciting moment of
all ah yes the reason I don't really
like removable other word trays because
when you cable manage anything you
usually use the motherboard tray so I'm
going to go ahead
and remove these and then we'll show you
mother portray and we're ready now oh I
thought we were ready yeah I got this
uh-huh I hope I don't have to remove
these there we go all right we are
rolling now okay so how simple is it to
change the orientation of your
motherboard all you got to do is take
this whole structure right here and then
slide it in this way okay it's just
fully reversible case and a lot oh I see
it and there we go so now it is using a
standard right-side-up motherboard tray
you can still do the front mounted power
supply nothing really changes it's just
a matter of how you want your computer
setup so in summary bottom-to-top
airflow 180 degree flippable motherboard
tray you got the supports for your
graphics cards should you see fit you
got your hot swaps you got your uh yeah
there's a couple more three and a half
inch or a five and a quarter I don't
know what these are for they're going to
put a power supply there anyway so don't
worry about it so you got five three and
a half inch or two and a half inch bays
four or five and a quarter inch bays by
default I say five because when I meant
to say was six and XL ATX compatible
basically you got everything this is
kind of like the Swiss Army knife of
cases because you can fit absolutely
anything in it so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the
azza genesis 9000 not over 9000 exactly
9000 and don't forget to subscribe -
tech tips from our boxing's reviews and
other computer videos we should clarify
a point about the handle we were wrong
the handle actually doesn't have to have
the screws removed in order to take the
motherboard tray out so so it is it's
fine also here we are putting the
packing materials back on the case you
know what it should still actually kind
of be okay once we put it back in the
box so
how that goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
