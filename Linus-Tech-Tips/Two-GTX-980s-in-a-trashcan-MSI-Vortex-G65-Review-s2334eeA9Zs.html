core i7 cylinder shaped PC that MSI
first showed off at CES 2016 refusing to
allow me to see the insides apparently
for fear that I would break it which is
fair I suppose is shipping now so after
all the waiting men I have finally got
my hands on a finished unit of the MSI
vortex g65 to validate their claims that
it is fast small and quiet while looking
in my eyes pretty freaking cool let's
get down to it
glass wire is the intuitive easy-to-use
firewall software that reveals and
visualizes your network traffic in real
time get it free now and use offer code
Linus to upgrade and save 10% for added
features things got off to a good start
when I first booted windows and was
greeted by a product registration and a
prompt to download an install Google
Chrome a nice touch by the way to not
even pre-install your bloatware making
it truly optional then took a turn down
poo stick Avenue with a gigantic Norton
registration pop-up let's see what else
is on here some of this stuff is ok
afterburner for overclocking the video
card there majimak DSP utility and the
one year xsplit gamecaster license I can
live with but battery calibration
doesn't have a battery MSI social media
collection the helpdesk seemed like a
good idea but most of what's in here
feels even less useful than in Windows
his own help tools let's move on to
hardware things get a lot more
impressive here
measuring a mere ten and a half inches
tall and about seven and a half inches
in diameter
the entire computer is not that much
bigger than a single gtx 980 reference
card and it's got two gtx 980 s inside
not to mention it has something the 918
never had RGB lighting I guess that
explains the four thousand dollar asking
price in terms of Io there's nothing at
the front but a power button but I don't
really mind that given how easy the
system is to reach around to the back
for a fairly easy access to most of the
ample connectivity starting at the top
is optical audio three-and-a-half
millimeter audio jacks or speakers in a
microphone four USB 3.0 five gigabit
type-a port to HDMI 1.4 ports wouldn't
have minded if those were HDMI 2.0 two
Gigabit LAN ports powered by killer
networks two mini DisplayPort 1.2 ports
and finally two reversible type-c USB
ports that can handle USB 3 DisplayPort
1.2 or even thunder
three duty let's move inside there are
actually two different configurations on
the MSI US site at the time of writing
this but the only way in which they
differ is the installed system memory
and graphics card setup so they both pac
and intel core i7 6700 k skylake quad
core hyper threaded cpu with a maximum
4.4 gigahertz turbo boost speed and
assumed upgrade ability to the upcoming
codenamed KB Lake architecture thanks to
a socketed cpu design they both feature
z170 chipset motherboard that's been
fully customized to fit in this unusual
form factor and provide all the
necessary internal connectivity to MXM
video card slots for the GPUs a mini
PCIe for the killer and 1535 AC wireless
this is a mu-mimo capable wave 2 device
by the way 2 m2 PCIe x4 gen 3 slots for
the 2 by 128 gig raid 0 boot drive
configuration or whatever you want to
put in there after the fact a SATA 3
port for the 1 terabyte tuna 1/2 inch
hard drive end customized power
connectors for the 450 watt 80 plus gold
chickeny power supply so then as far as
differences are concerned the lower end
model features 16 gigs of DDR for sodium
memory and 2 3 gig gtx 960 s in sli
while the other packs 32 gigs of ram and
2 8 gig gtx 980 s in sli it's important
to note that each of these are full
desktop configuration GPUs similar to
the full-fat MXM form factor gtx 980
video cards that started showing up in
laptops around september 2015
neither of them comes cheap by the way
the entry-level one goes for 2200 u.s.
dollars with the top-of-the-line ski
running about four thousand US dollars
like i alluded to before so how then
does emma side justify a price tag like
this well when you've got a unique
product
I guess you pretty much dictate what
it's worth and they've got that while
there is one other high performance
trashcan shape
pc on the market' the 2013 Mac Pro that
one will appeal to a very different
customer sure they're both round and
they both feature an assisted convection
cooling configuration with a large fan
that draws air in the bottom and
exhausts it from the top of the unit but
other than that I would argue they're
really nothing alike
thanks to Apple's use of an LGA 2011 CPU
socket they can cram up to 18 CPU cores
into theirs but while both computers
boast dual video cards the workstation
fire pro GPUs in the Mac Pro are more
appealing to creative professionals than
they are to gamers the vortex g35 LGA
1151 socket can by contrast hold only a
maximum of four CPU cores but this feels
like a sensible direction given that
more than four CPU cores
hasn't been demonstrated to help with
straight gaming I've got a video by the
way showing what it takes to finally
overwhelm an eight-core Extreme Edition
check that out here so that extra power
and thermal budget can be used to throw
more video card horsepower at the
problem so what does that translate to
then well really really good performance
as advertised
the vortex g65 is a very strong little
gaming machine capable of handling
anything you can throw at it including
gaming at resolutions above 1080p gaming
with textures maxed thanks to the eight
gigs of VRAM per GPU and thanks to the
top-of-the-line consumer-grade core i7
processor but of course all this
hardware means nothing if it creates an
unpleasant user experience due to
acoustics or doesn't run to its full
potential due to thermal issues and I'm
pleased to report that the acoustics
much like the Mac Pro are shocking with
the tower emitting only an unobtrusive
low hum even while gaming and the
thermals are pretty darn good on the
GPUs you'll see about 75 degrees in our
Crysis 3 skybox and Unigine Heaven tests
and while under full CPU load in i-264
that's without the GPUs doing anything
by the way the CPU did sit in the low
80s in a 19 degree ambient room this
result does
to me indicate a poorly designed
computer that kind of a sustained
multi-core load would only be seen in
short bursts like while rendering a
video for example on a gaming machine so
all it means to me is that I probably
wouldn't find myself overclocking this
system in spite of its advertised
overclock ability which leads us then to
the conclusion is the vortex g65 worth
your money I guess it depends what
you're after
while Thunderbolt 3 and external PCI
Express expansion enclosures seem to be
finally reaching maturity making me feel
better about giving up all of my PCI
Express slots I find the core component
upgrade ability of this device a little
bit worrisome with future CPUs likely to
arrive in only 4 core variants and no
guarantee at this time that MSI will be
offering Pascal based GPU upgrade
modules like they promised on their GTA
ii titan but with that said if you're
willing to pay and videos premium for
those MXM gtx 980 video cards for a
super small gaming rig that packs a
shocking punch then there's simply
nothing else on the market like it and
we're back with another offer from our
friends at mass drop if you guys aren't
familiar with mass drop head over to
their site it's linked in the video
description they've got all kinds of
cool stuff everything from wow my table
cloths going away that's ok they don't
have table cloths as far as I know but
they do have things like knives drones
uh audiophile gear like headphones amps
and DACs keyboards all kinds of cool
stuff camping supplies even and the way
it works is the community says hey we
want to buy this thing but and it's kind
of expensive and that's how it goes yeah
ok cool
we'll go to the manufacturer we'll get
them to slash the price as long as a
bunch of you guys agree to buy it so the
more people glom on to a drop the
further down the drop goes to a maximum
limit and they've got a pretty cool
offer to talk about today this is the
AKG K 553 pro headphones they feature a
closed yet open design which offers the
noise isolated
use of closed back headphones with a
more expansive soundstage it's an over
your head wrong with soft leather out of
your pads it terminates an eighth inch
or a three and a half millimeter jack
but also includes a quarter inch adapter
and features 50 millimeter drivers it's
got an MSRP of 299 but it's available on
mass drop for one 1999 at the lowest
drop so check out the link in the video
description that is draw dot slash LTT
