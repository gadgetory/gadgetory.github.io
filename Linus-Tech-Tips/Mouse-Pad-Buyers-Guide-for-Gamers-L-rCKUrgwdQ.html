gamers featuring my personal collection
of mouse pads kick back and relax I'm
about to blow your mousing mind and
explain the real differences that matter
between the more well-known pads and
mats as well as a couple that aren't
Pinterest errs and Facebook keys need
not apply just use your desk or
something
the Coolermaster Nova touch tkeuld
utilizes genuine topor hybrid capacitive
switches and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
okay so mousepad buyer's guide that's
that's like stupid just buy a mousepad
in the color that you want done that's
it right yeah
if you're a noob who plays Call of Duty
actually there are subtle differences
that have a substantial impact on your
mousing experience there once was a time
that mousepads really mattered older
optical sensors laser sensors had
trouble tracking on a variety of
surfaces like textures and colors so you
needed a surface optimized for it these
days optical sensors can track almost as
well as laser sensors on most surfaces
so there you have it mouse pads actually
don't matter video over well they might
not matter in terms of tracking but
there are things to consider when buying
one most manufacturers product pages
have irrelevant buzz phrases like smooth
with maximum glide and control but come
on that's just not that useful well
let's take a deeper dive and see what
does matter when buying a mousepad and
gives you a quick rundown of the various
types of surfaces broken down by
material first up are the cloth pads the
key CK has been the most widely used
mouse pad for pro gamers why well you
want to be able to stop instantly even
when your mass is flying around high
glide speeds might make it hard to
control your aim as the momentum might
carry you over your target the Q CK has
what I'll call medium to low glide with
movements coming to a stop pretty
quickly the liftoff distance is about 1
to 1.5 CDs high this is the height that
mice will stop tracking when you lift to
reposition your mouse in it as it turns
out mouse pads can't affect this getting
back to the Q ck it comes in a variety
of sizes and two thicknesses then might
offer more speed as the thick might
cushion and absorb some of the downward
force but the key CK heavy can give you
a bit more of a consistent experience if
you have small imperfections in your
desktop the Corsair Vengeance
200 has been out for a few years and at
first glance looks a lot like the thick
q CK's the liftoff distance is 1 to 1.5
C DS hi just like the QC K and it even
feels like the ki CK with a tiny
difference that actually has a big
effect the Q CK has a freeness that some
cotton t-shirts have but the vengeance
doesn't without the furnace the MM 200
is a smoother surface that feels faster
than the QC k the mass pad also comes in
a variety of sizes to fit your needs
ranging from the small to the extended
edition which is long enough to cover
your keyboard mouse and vensim the MM
200 comes rolled in a hard cardboard
tube like you get with a poster in my
experience this prevents curling that
can happen to other cloth pads that come
rolled up in a smaller box package kind
of like the Goliath this package
speaking of which the glyphosate from
razor are rapidly gaining in popularity
due in part to their aggressive eSports
sponsorship campaigns the control has a
thick and rough woven texture like a
burlap sack but smoother both pads have
a braided edge to help prevent fraying
and are thinner than most mess pads the
bottom is green rubber that does a
really good job of keeping it from
sliding around the speed version is more
like a a regular cloth pad but with a
slicker smoother feel which makes it
feel faster than the other pad so far
and according to the slow-mo it is
actually faster the control despite the
coarseness feels almost as fast both the
speed and control have a liftoff
distance of about 2 CDs so in spite of
the graphic and difference in textures
tracking is just fine although some mice
do need to be recalibrated to work on
the control due to the rougher thicker
weave next up is a throwback to the
Linus circa 2009 if you were playing CS
back when 1.6 was fresh you might
remember this one before the qck reigned
supreme the pure track talent was the
one associated with pro gaming but not
without controversy at the time the
print design particularly the white one
posed the tracking issue for some mice
as I said earlier though
SURS are actually really good now and
you probably won't have an issue with it
if you bought a mouse in the last year
or two here's a picture I tweeted of my
desktop the liftoff distance is higher
than the qck at two CDs versus one but
it's about the same as the other pad so
far the pure track talent is the most
comfortable mouse pad I've ever used
it's like it's super soft on my wrist
it's like silk it's amazing it's also
got the space for me to swing my arm
around and still provides enough
stopping speed for my flick shots in
Linus's ancient unboxing he thought it
was too fast compared to the qck but
it's just right for me it's weird though
I thought it was faster than the QC k2
but according to the slo-mo it's
actually kind of slower like quite a bit
anyway while it lacks the fancy razor
braiding it still built to last this is
a pure track from upstairs that
definitely looks like it's been around
for years and it still performs it's
super thick and comes in two sizes
standard which is actually larger than
the extra large for most other mouse
pads and a smaller version for desks
with limited space now on to the hard
pads they're not as popular but they
definitely fill a niche for gamers who
demands speed because the surface is
hard and stiff force from the movement
isn't absorbed and instead goes right
into moving a mess but just as we've
seen with cloth pads the material plays
a big part in exactly how fast the
surface feels the destructor 2 is made
of a hard rigid black polycarbonate with
a rubber base that keeps the destructor
from never moving during normal use the
rough and bumpy texture makes it really
really fast it's among the fastest mouse
pads I've ever used personally though I
find it too hard to stop precisely and
even worse the liftoff distance is 5 CDs
when paired with my business 2014 mouse
that's 5 times higher than qck math if
your mouse doesn't have adjustable lift
off distance you might actually find it
unusable for low sensitivity gaming
where you have to lift frequently on the
other hand I find it great for
productivity use
our TSS or MOBAs because of the
effortless glide and reduced need for
pinpoint precision now for an entirely
different kind of hard math bed the my
onyx ant is 320 it's made of aluminium
instead of plastic it's cold to the
touch and the edges can be hard on the
wrist and it's got a very very smooth
surface and because of that it's much
lower than the destructor - and only
provides net levels of feedback the
liftoff distance is not that different
from cloth pads so it's definitely
viable for something like cs:go the func
1030 is an interesting choice and might
be good for those of you who are
indecisive or like to change your
surface depending on what you're doing
this is a two-piece mousepad there's a
smooth plastic frame that has rubber
pads on the bottom to keep it planted on
your desk and the second piece is the
Messing surface that has two different
sides this side is semi smooth flipping
in the round reveals the rough side that
is similar to the destructor actually
strangely enough according to our
slow-mo tests both sides provided
similar speeds and were faster than the
destructor - relatively new options are
hybrid silicone pads they're called
hybrid because they have the speed of
hard pads but the control of cloth the
bottom of the mask pads all feature a
tacky smooth rubber surface that do an
amazing job of keeping them on your desk
the surface textures are very similar
between the mega soma - and hero 3d the
pattern is rough but not hard like
plastic pads it's a soft silicone that
provides a glide almost as fast as the
func ten-thirty and destructor - but
with enough control to make stopping
flick shots possible liftoff distance
isn't dramatically affected like it is
in the destructor - and their glide
speed is comfortably fast
I love the performance of all of the
silicone pads but these are the only
sizes they come in and they're simply
not big enough for me to use
if SteelSeries razor rocket made an
extra large like their cloth pads I'd
buy one in an instant for the visual
learners out there we've handcrafted

closer look at the chart and comment
below and let us know what part of the
chart is
perfect for you do you like it hard and
fast or slow and controlled let me know
