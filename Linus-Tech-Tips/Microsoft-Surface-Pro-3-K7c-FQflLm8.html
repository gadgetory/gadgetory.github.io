I've always wanted to love my conclusion
about the original when I checked out
the surface RT was that I thought the
potential was amazing but it needed to
be acts 86 it needed to be faster and
prices needed to come down well with the
first two addressed and the pricing a
non-factor for me since I traded in my
Lamborghini when my wife got pregnant
with kid number two let's see if the
surface pro 3 is what I imagined this
concept could become with its power loss
protection affordability and performance
the SP 924 may data makes upgrading to
an SSD remarkably safe and simple let's
start with the initial unboxing
impressions the AC adapter is compact
and has a USB charging port Broc on the
device itself is much lighter feeling
than I expected the original surface was
well balanced but dense this one reminds
me of my first impressions of the iPhone
5 it's light but still feels premium and
super sexy at the same time and the
satin metal finish on the back actually
made me say out loud how the hell did
they do that it's the best feeling
windows device I have ever held but
let's move on I got a purple type cover
and from reading initial impressions
from press at the unveiling I was
expecting it to kind of suck it totally
doesn't the integrated touchpad is ok
it's not precise enough it's palm
rejection sucks and two-handed operation
is basically impossible but at least it
has a nice tactile click and the size is
a good compromise the keyboard on the
other hand is an engineering miracle in
my opinion
I swear they've got each key descending
into a portal to another universe to get
that much travel distance on such a thin
keyboard I actually really liked it
except it's too bad it doesn't have a
print screen button and I have to
double-click the back of the stylus to
do that deal-breaker I'll be returning
the surface pro 3 but let's press onward
anyway shall we speaking of the stylus I
guess if I was a student or an artist
maybe I would give a crap but as it is
the best thing Microsoft could have done
for me is give me some
going to tuck it away so I can ignore it
forever too bad there is no slot for it
and the instructions and seriously my
eye is just about rolled out of my head
tell you to stick it to the magnetic
charging port when you're not using it
what a joke
what if I need to charge my device
geniuses well no problem says the
instructions you bought a type cover
right here's the cheapest little chunk
of fabric that we could find attached to
a sticker put this on your type cover
and put the pen through it are you
freaking kidding me
a stylus is either an integral part of
the design or it's a stupid niche
accessory that cost $50 every time I
lose it if it's the former it goes
inside and if it's the latter then don't
bother talking about it
alright but let's talk specs while I
calm down Microsoft gives potential
customers lots of well balanced CPU RAM
and drive choices I picked up the core
i5 4300 u version with eight gigs of RAM
and a 256 gig solid-state drive beyond
that things are pretty standardized so
everyone gets a 12 inch 2160 by 1440 3
by 2 aspect ratio 10-point multi-touch
IPS display a nine hour battery wireless
AC Bluetooth 4.0 etc these are some damn
impressive tech specs given the size and
weight of this sucker
speaking of size and weight let's move
on to the physical overview on the left
we find a volume rocker and a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack on the
right is a mini DisplayPort port a USB 3
port and the magnetic locking reversible
power button on the top is a lock button
and ventilation holes and finally on the
bottom is the shockingly strong magnetic
clip hmm goes to show you when you try
to demo something typical Microsoft
right is the shockingly strong magnetic
clip for the type cover the back has one
of the two five megapixel cameras simple
clean surface branding and the much
improved kickstand I mean this thing is
awesome it's still flawlessly flush when
closed it still has that car door sound
and feel of the old one and it's much
more flexible now it works open a little
bit in your lap or on your desk
open all the way propped on a pillow and
everywhere in between it is so well
constructed I mean I already said the
device is beautiful once but I feel like
I should say it again here because I'm
about to start beating on it pretty hard
as we make our way
the front the display would be perfect
if it wasn't for some very noticeable
backlight bleed on dark backgrounds the
windows button would be perfect if it
wasn't exactly where I rest my thumb
when I hold it in landscape mode the
front facing speakers would be perfect
if the ports for them were big enough to
actually sound like their front facing
and the card reader slot under the
kickstand would be perfect if it was a
full sized SD slot instead of a micro SD
I mean seriously what's the excuse on
something this big I can adapt down but
not up but so far all this stuff you
could have figured out from reading a
spec sheet what is this thing like to
actually use so to find out I set
everything up on the surface
took my XPS 12 out of my backpack and
left for a four day business trip I mean
that's what this thing is supposed to be
for right road warriors it fits in my
windows just a bag like a boss but then
the first time I took it out I ran into
trouble the kickstand system just
doesn't give you the same economic
options that a normal hinge does I was
starting in my chair and I realized I
couldn't really get the screen to face
me properly then shortly afterward due
to its top-end heaviness it fell off of
my lap fortunately I caught it with my
legs but these are the kinds of problems
with the surfaces organ omics that don't
exist with a normal clamshell then I was
on the plane and making some notes for
this review so I propped up the keyboard
to a comfortable angle with the
surprisingly robust little magnetic
system here OOP fired upward one of the
many applications that doesn't have a
metro UI version and realize two things
number one is that the airplane tray
wasn't long enough for the kickstand to
rest hon so I actually had to prop the
screen against the seat in front of me
relying on friction to keep the keyboard
from sliding towards me and number two
is that what the keyboard angled up I
can't touch the taskbar with my fingers
very well and switch between
applications something I've become very
accustomed to with my Dell Harrigan
there are positive points though further
into the trip I was using it to offload
footage from a camera's SD card using a
USB 3 reader and I was struck by the
appeal of a full proper Windows machine
in such a tiny form-factor and with such
great battery life I mean it's true
compared to
normal tablet the surface pro 3 is just
so versatile and so powerful having
proper access to the folder tree having
easy flexible networking capabilities
having strong driver support from random
crap like printers I mean even something
as simple as having a proper full-size
USB 3 port these are all fantastic
selling points and those selling points
unfortunately aren't going to help it
overcome my objections to it I mean
maybe part of the problem is I'm not the
right customer I own about half a dozen
tablets and I haven't touched any of
them in months for me a flagship
smartphone has a big high-res enough
screen for casual use and if something
is time consuming or important enough to
be worth getting off my butt to go get
something better I'm going to go get my
XPS 12 a device that has a real keyboard
a better touchpad runs quieter also
happens to work as a notebook or as a
tablet and is available for the same
price as a surface pro 3 with a type
cover and at this point you might come
to Microsoft students saying but - the
XPS 12 is a bit big and heavy for tablet
use and doesn't come with a stylus -
which I would reply you're right but the
surface 3 pro is a bit big and heavy for
tablet use - and as for the stylus I
don't give a crap about drawing on my
computer if I did I'd buy a Wacom
companion it's also similarly priced and
includes a much better stylus for folks
who are serious about drawing on the
tablets ok Linus gotcha
but in Microsoft's defense they were
never targeting tablets with the surface
pro 3 anyway their marketing is aimed
squarely at the MacBook Air - which I
would reply good for them I guess if
that's how they want this review
structured then here's the tagline they
can put on the product page this device
I would never buy is competitive with
another device I would never buy 5 stars
the MacBook Air doesn't have a
touchscreen so it was never in the
running for me anyway I wouldn't even
begin to consider a notebook without a
touchscreen at this point and once you
get one you'll probably never go back
either trust me now the screen
resolution and the more square aspect
ratio could have won me over from a
Productivity standpoint if Windows 8.1
didn't still handle tech scaling with
the poising brace of a giraffe on a pair
of stilts and ice skates on the ends due
to the pixel density of its screen
surface pro 3 needs text scaling and
comes with icons and text enlarged out
of the box but it really takes away from
the beauty of the display when so many
things are blurry and crappy looking I
mean third-party developers are
definitely a big part of the problem but
it feels a bit hypocritical for
Microsoft to be upset about their
lollygagging when within Windows there
are still things that don't scale
correctly so that's it sorry Microsoft I
can't recommend this product and even
worse I no longer believe the surface
concept belongs in a world where - and
ones exist the Windows tablet experience
is bad enough that I find myself only
wanting to use it occasionally and in
the 2% of the time that happens I'll
settle for a bulkier heavier tablet
experience in exchange for a better
notebook one the other 98% of the time
there are going to be people for whom
the surface is perfect but I'm just not
one of them say Livi thanks guys for
