cable mod you know these guys that make
fancy cables they just launched builds
dot GG which they're gonna kill me for
putting it this way but it's basically
Pinterest for gaming rigs so if he so
you build a gaming rig you submit it and
then people can get inspiration they can
see what parts you use they can see what
like mods you applied to it or whatever
the case may be and you can also go
there if you want to find like the
coolest rad stuff for your build anyway
to celebrate the announcement they are
sponsoring this video where Alex and I
are going to be building our submission
to build CG and they're launching a
contest which obviously we're going to
be winning where they're giving away
10,000 US dollars in prizes for the
sickest builds so check that out but not
before you check this build out
oh let's have we told them what we're
doing yet we're building an awesome
system for for build Statue G okay all
right so you have this course there C X
600 yeah be a bit careful because these
are just wires why are these just bare
it says in the thing scrapyard Wars is
the reason so water cooling next is
cooling right yeah so I have this Swift
tech radiator
I really like the bit where is it
yeah the marine epoxy that's in here
from the time that you drilled into it
fun bit of trivia for our viewers
radiators used to be designed with the
water tubes directly under the screw
holes so it was a fairly easy mistake to
make if you accidentally over tighten
something a little I've heard the washer
aesthetic is like really in because the
more washers you have the cleaner your
build okay so what tubing do you think
we should use I was thinking we need
quick connects anyway so the white could
just run to the quick connects and then
we could change it to blue and red you
know what though there's a compelling
practical reason for putting in some
clear tubing that way we can make sure
the water is in there
Oh true yeah and we need to make sure
that it doesn't kink and write my own
coils yeah those are really important so
basically the way it works is you just
kind of put it on there kind of like
that and then it's like instant
performance increase for your tubing
kink free oh this right here goes on the
front
our build we're gonna have to go in from
behind hmm actually I think that you can
just take this whole radiator bit out
yeah and just move it right to here then
does that fit cuz if we could get even
more cooling that would be great we
could just double-sided tape it oh yeah
that could totally work so for this
build we're going to be using the ROG
Maximus X formula it's a set 370 board
and it's actually freaking sweet so
really don't make a mess so we've got
water cooling for the vrm that's built
right into the motherboard it's awesome
but my only concern is that these VRMs
put out a lot of heat yeah so we
probably shouldn't combine the CPU and
the VRMs on the same radiator so I'm
thinking is there's this cooler master
Gemini or gemin 2's 424 yeah which I
think could look really good in this
case how does this go on oh yeah it goes
over the RAM so that you get the
additional benefits of cooling the round
that's something you won't get with
normal water cooling so we're going to
go with the Trident C Royals they're
definitely the blingiest Ram on the
market at the moment it's like look at
that look can you just see me so the
most important thing before you put on
your CPU cooler is to make sure that you
get the correct amount of thermal paste
oh that's gonna make a mess don't do
that don't do that it's gonna take like
10-15 minutes to clean that up oh my god
it's a dick up into the left just a
touch
so we're gonna have to sew tack mini
1080 that uh it got a bit chopped up so
yeah yeah in the case yeah I remember
that
um did we shave down the top of it -
yeah it looks like that we did this is
gonna look great
oh yeah straight from unloved 0 to epic
hero by not cutting off the end of this
zip tie I can actually keep it for use
later on down the line because all you
need to do is stick a little pin or
something in there and you can bend that
little plastic tab down and then you can
actually extract this and completely
reuse it for any length of project so
I'm just gonna fold this up under the
card kind of like that and what's really
cool is that we actually get some
additional cooling for the rest of the
system out of this configuration so
we're gonna put the GPU in the vertical
mount right here and that gives us some
direct cooling for our chipset which is
located right here on the motherboard so
I guess one thing that we haven't
thought of yet
is where is our pumping reservoir going
to go no you know what it actually looks
like
look there are over Ang's in here that's
o-rings not threading Oh straight piped
in - in fact I love it so since that's
just the reservoir we also have a pump
yeah so I was thinking that this one
right here from active aqua which
conveniently has its own power supply we
could just put it in here it has suction
cups on the bottom - uh that's great and
then we could just have it have its own
power cord no that goes oh I hear can
you help me cable manage this first
though I'm sure see that that actually
goes right back to if we just put a
screw in there it's not the right one
but uh it should work yeah I'm always
gonna notice we do not have the correct
size fittings at all oh really yeah
we could just not do that yeah I think
we're gonna have to not do the pump so I
found another pump rez combo oh great
I'm just not sure where to put it it's
like kind of too long to go up in here
like the last one yeah I like it fits
but it's not gonna be great
it could go sort of right there but it
might be kind of messy yeah I don't
really like that look mm-hmm I'm just
really disappointed that we're not gonna
get to use this rez anymore can we use
this one too and just put it up into the
top sure cool yeah tell me - Reza's is
fine well and it makes a lot of sense
because you want to have the water nice
and high yeah so then we can just loop
it here up there yeah I found that when
I was strapping on my second fan here
which I really want for optimal cooling
that I was accidentally covering my PCI
Express power connector here but get
this I can actually repurpose my fan
strap here as like cable management to
hold it in that is using the old noggin
now our power supply isn't modular so we
can't actually replace the 24 pin cable
but we can get what I think is really
basically the cable not experienced with
one of these extensions so we're just
gonna run this down keeping the cable
nice and taut as we go and then we're
gonna run it back up and you can see
that with the really vibrant green and
black color scheme our extension cable
the regular one just kind of fades into
the background and you barely see it at
all okay so I found some fan splitters
and fan extensions so that's how we're
gonna get power to our front fans over
here and then I also found this single
SATA 2 quad SATA power at at home nice
yeah so that way with just this one SATA
power plug we can power up to four SATA
devices high amperage check this out
there's even a high amperage header on
this motherboard it's like it was
designed for me to plug three fans into
it now what I noticed
is that those leads that I taped up
mm-hmm what we could do is we could
splice on a molex connector
oh yes that to power the pump or do you
think that we can just run this over to
that and just sort it right on I mean I
still want them to be detachable though
so I'm not gonna solder them I'm just
gonna use this them together and use
electrical tape oh okay okay this is
like the perfect situation where you
want to use these antique ink what do
you even call them just antique anchors
yeah tube coils
tube coils okay yep and as you can see
I've gotten a bit artistic with it and
kind of made a little a pattern here
then we're able to just come in here
like this would be horrible if we did
not have these on but now we do not have
to worry at all about potential pink
äj-- and those VRMs just hitting 5,000
degrees i mean that should be fine yeah
so you go in there with that and then we
bring another tube out of there into the
vrm cooler and then we're good
we've completed the loop just make sure
you leave enough slack in the lines that
actually has a double benefit so one
allows us to pull that out and fill it
and then put it back in and two that
means we can repurpose the soft tubing
for a future build if we have a run
that's slightly longer oh yes so I
really want to use white to go down to
the VRMs but we only have this little
scrap of tubing fortunately check this
out this quick can act from colder not
only matches our red white and blue
color scheme it can act as a coupler so
then we can actually take check this out
this piece of red tubing then and extend
it that is perfect
three two oh one oh dang so one of our
Corsair fans isn't connected but that's
not does work I think you might just
have to power cycle real quick here I
thought I saw hey nice ok so now we just
need to I think we need to plug it up
plug it into a monitor and stuff get
these fan headers turned on and on yeah
we've got all of these cables for the
light strips which looks not all that
great you can't have
those cables there so I'm going to use
this cable mode AIO sleeping to just get
it all nice and tucked away so we don't
have to worry too much about it oh I can
smell it we are so close
so at the back we've got a matching
power an HDMI cable and then we've got
other colors I mean yeah she walked out
she really getting pretty I came from
the bottom
I came from the bottom Mobile Alabama
all my killers and go and chill with
your girl I see coach Lee I'm neht dool
neht dool
we've got quite the puddle here I might
need to swap it out every like hour or
two of use but that's fine think of it
like oil changes for your car okay but
instead of oil changes just filling out
the oil leaks out the bottom which I
mean that's a big example to deal with
with their cars oh yes we've got a full
bench drive ready to rock here I want
let's see this thing Hall there's
artifacting our GP is dead tickets
speaking of dead this mean so thanks for
