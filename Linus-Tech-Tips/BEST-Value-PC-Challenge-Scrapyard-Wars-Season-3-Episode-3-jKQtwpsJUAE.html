brought to you by deep brand all right
so it is the beginning of day two and
the very first thing we do is check
email someone who emailed ahead of you
has confirmed he is coming to buy it
there first thing in the morning so
don't come out before phoning me around
11:00 and make sure it's still available
this is Luke I know it it is absolutely
Luke oh man we're not gonna have enough
time oh the guy with the 79 50s reply
back so we can get the city 915 oh no we
don't have time for this right now we
have to you have to go right now
oh this is for the case each the guys
local so it should not be that far
Oh 25 minutes away day two scrapyard
wars oh we are going to get that
graphics card that I talked about
yesterday the r9 290 gigabyte wind force
and then I have bad news the motherboard
CPU and cooler platform guy responded
saying that he had a lot of two gigabyte
six of RAM his good news and then also
told me that he forgot to bring it to
work with him today and that he might
not be able to tomorrow so I was
distracted trying to have Brandon email
motherboard guy so I went the wrong way
on the highway so I'm going to pick up
the graphics card where BCIT he's
waiting I'm late I'm gonna go I actually
heard back from a fair number of my
lowball graphics card offers so it's a
good thing I did this before running out
and picking up that $20 video card that
I arranged yesterday because if I can
find something better
i'ma just bail on that guy so first up
we've got a GTX 460 for 30 bucks the guy
came down from or up from my offer of 20
gtx 550 ti na sorry
this card is too good for $35 well 7870
$40 firm for a broken card what an idiot
frickin tool this guy didn't reply to
any of my questions are you really the
line of sebastian from NCIX okay so no
useful leads whatsoever let's get down
to business so I decided I'm gonna go
for the one shot you know home run swing
right off the bat here I'm gonna load
literally all of this hardware up and
I'm gonna see if it boots and if it does
then I am in really good shape for the
rest of the day and if it doesn't and we
got nothing
ah I knew this motherboard wasn't going
to work why did I even let myself think
it might balls
another shot here with a proper power
supply and see if maybe that's the issue
the display on the back it actually has
a post read up back here but I can fit
no way
we got Anna soos our og board for gigs
of working ddr2 IQ 6600 and a broken
power supply which I'm totally okay with
for 60 bucks
so I know what we're doing today we need
to obtain a new power supply okay I'm
okay with that we need to obtain a case
and what's great about that is it's
really easy to find a case power supply
combos so we need to go out and get a
case power supply combo we still need to
potentially find a graphics card but I'm
going to find out about that in a minute
here maybe we should spend some of our
time obtaining a better cooler because
the cue 6,600 can run pretty hot when
you overclock it so having a really
beefy cooler on there could be the ace
up our sleeve ah we got to go we might
just lose a motherboard right now do we
bail on this guy and try to get it from
case okay so it is 10:09 and everything
is already going completely wrong I'm
pretty sure Lucas getting our
motherboard right now and I just
realized the guy who has the case who
supposedly locals actually 25 minutes
away and this guy is expecting us to
like show up and like 5 minutes you
might be a little screwed here the good
thing that might save us is that we have
leads on both a 69 90 and a pair of 79
50s both of which should be doable
really so I think what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go to this guy's house pick
up the case and the power supply and
then we're gonna do is we're going to go
and grab see what kind of stuff we can
get at the computer shop because that's
we don't have any other appointments I
don't think we might um yeah we'll go to
the computer shop and see what we can
find if the guy has a good motherboard
then we should be able to either pull
off 7950 or the 69 90s but it's gonna be
tricky so I have bad news and great news
the bad news is a motherboard system guy
still hasn't messaged me back good news
is I got the graphics card for 180
dollars
I saved 20 bucks how did I do that well
I checked out the card before he gave it
to me
it's a 290 everything's fine but there's
one little oddity and I went to go take
it out of the bag I noticed this there's
no screws right there there's one screw
holding the plate on here but it's
missing a screw here it's missing two
here in two screws here so I was like
that's kind of weird started complaining
and he gave me 20 bucks off so I got a
290 after market cooled card for a
hundred and eighty dollars which is
pretty sick I just need to make sure
that I have a computer to put it in it
is time to call free geek and see how
much they can save my ass
hopefully entirely scrapyard Wars we'll
be right back after these messages this
episode of scrapyard wars is brought to
you by D brand makers of the precision
cut vinyl skins that you'll see on the
phones and notebooks of our contestants
they offer a wide variety of styles and
colors and support for the coolest
devices including the PlayStation 4
galaxy note 5 and iPhone 6s protect the
body of your devices and make them look
great at be brand calm slash scrapyard
Wars one thing we do have going for us
is that Luc Linus and I we all had a
chat this morning and basically the idea
is is that we're all going to try to
have all of our parts by the end of the
day but if we don't have everything
today we're gonna have until noon
tomorrow so they will have two hours
tomorrow to go and get any last-minute
parts we need so we should be able to
get everything today and we'll do the
build off tomorrow so we don't really
have to worry about putting the together
the systems although I know Luc has
already got started on his sounded like
that anyway okay so we're here we're
about to pick up the case hopefully
don't get murdered this is the first
time we've actually use Craigslist for
this little trip so get some money and
hopefully have a case Hey hi says go on
Austin I thank you appreciate don't
separate those others our Michelin
welcome for you okay thank you
appreciate it it is officially view
again we have our case and I'm gonna say
it's actually way more beefy and I
thought it was so see here
let's got lock on it there we go that's
actually pretty solid and he showed me
the power supply does work we have a 120
fan in the back actually that one in the
front
no still though oh we even have a SATA
cable front panel all right I think
we're in business it's a little beat up
but it'll totally do for 25 bucks it's a
good start
so the guy with the sabre-tooth
motherboard replied he'll let me know if
it's sold or not he got multiple replies
and I have the first who first responded
the first chance you should be here
shortly and if he doesn't show up it'll
be yours it's not about getting more
money but more of a promise to keep Oh
be yours for the same price if other
guys doesn't show up so 7950 guy just
replied basically we're kind of out of
luck on this - he doesn't get home till
7 o'clock he could do it tomorrow but
that would eat up the little bit of time
we would have and we'd have to drive
like a power out of the way so there is
a 69 90 it's $180 so we're gonna meet
him at 2 o'clock so I just got the $200
r9 290 for a hundred and 80 bucks
because it was missing a couple screws
on the i/o plate which while they're
nice to have the card will run without
it
and I'm hoping that there might be some
spare ones for that in the in the spare
screw bin at work the motherboard and
system guy still has not messaged me
back he's at work I can't be mad but
this guy is getting a little frustrating
to deal with he's never had my phone
number he keeps on saying he's gonna
text me and he has not and that would be
a lot easier to communicate with him
over text messages he said he's going to
check for ram last night he did I also
told him to bring the stuff to work so I
could pick it up from him at work and he
did not because he apparently forgot or
didn't read that email or something kind
of think he just forgot so I've got a
graphics card and I've got a line on a
power supply which I'm going to pick up
later today other than that it's unknown
and the free geek stock is really
starting to freak me out so my new plan
is I'm going to go to free geek figure
out what they have if they have
everything I need which is very unlikely
but
if they do I'll just pick it all up if
they don't I will just kind of post up
probably near free geek in the car do as
much research as I can online try to
plan all the appointments I can for the
stuff that I can and then fill out the
holes that I can't find with stuff at
free geek
hopefully that will work I had a lot of
backup plans last night and most of them
are gone now but there's still a few
that seem to be on the fence of guys
that have 66 hundreds and other various
quad cores so I don't know might not be
screwed just really depends on what's it
freaking ya interested in QC 600
interested in a board that it can go in
and a fairly low capacity hard drive so
our options right now this is actually
way better than I expected this place is
super cool is $30 for an Intel DG 43 GT
did she say 35 and not 55 so I've got an
Asus p5q motherboard IQ 6600 a 120 160 I
don't remember gigabyte hard drive
spinning it up 7200 rpm and it was a
little vague but I think 8 gigs of ram
all for 100 bucks I'm a little bit
worried that this thing isn't gonna work
at all as you guys saw there there was
like Tim in the CPU socket and she
rubbed the pins on the board and did
that duh but anyways I think it'll I
think this will be good ok so I'm
throwing my Windows 7 test build on here
to find out what exactly this graphics
card is I cannot believe we got can't
believe that board works
I do have to say one cool thing about
the MacBook Air is that I forgot to
charge it used it a bunch yesterday it's
at like 65 percent battery cray-cray
oh wow it's a sound driver a co dot sis
was what caused the problem
interesting does this even oh oh wow um
we might have to go back to our buddy
there and get a sound card this
motherboard doesn't have onboard sound
so today's going well so far I have
determined that my motherboard by some
freaking miracle works the RAM is all
correctly detected the CPU is correctly
detected it even has drivers for up to
Windows 8.1 so we're going to be able to
run all of our benchmarks
I have arranged to go out and pick up
the graphics card that we figured out
yesterday and I've reached out to back
alley crack pipe computer owner guy
about going and getting a sound card
because that is the thing that probably
had that motherboard in the scrap heap I
don't have a sound card for it so if we
hear back from him maybe we can get a
case while we're there which leaves us
with the optional step of obtaining a
power supply because I could use the one
from the computer inside and that is
about it we're in really good shape it
is time to boogie so I'm just going to
cover up my progress so far and head oh
all right so we are here at the computer
store and hopefully we'd be in a lot of
what we need because we need roughly
everything right now so let's give it a
try
Hey so basically we were able to get a
lot of what we needed so we're able to
get a core i7 2609 well close the
motherboard so it will support crossfire
so we're good with the 6990 but the most
important thing is we've got a seriously
powerful CPU we have a seriously
powerful graphics card we have a 160 gig
hard drive because 15 bucks and we just
need to run benchmarks it's not all
going to make a difference and we have
our second power supply so this is
actually a pretty beefy supply it
actually has an eight pin and a 6 pin so
basically right now I think we're in
pretty good shape I think once we look
glue this or tape this up to the top of
the case granby set so let's go do it
okay so they had a problem mounting the
stock heatsink but the price is good so
I really want to make sure it works so
they let me back into their testing area
which is awesome letting us film which
is awesome free geek is awesome I need
to note this thing though yeah it's I
think the heatsink has a problem that
really sucks because something that I do
know doesn't work is this top salaat but
they say that this one works I want to
make sure it works before I mean the the
arm is broken off that's why it won't
shoot yeah I hate these freaking stock
heat sinks man that's one side in so the
whole right side went in no problem at
all the whole right sides in the left
side on the other hand is just not
working out for me very well I'm having
second thoughts about my video card
matrix strategy what I realized is I'm
calculating FPS per dollar as a function
of only the cost of the graphics card
I have not factored in the rest of the
compute
so if a graphics card costs $10 more
that doesn't mean that if I'm spending
$20 I'm spending 50% more I better get
50% more FPS that means that compared to
the rest of the cost of the system I
might be spending 10% more I only have
to get 10% more FPS so basically the
more expensive graphics cards might be
totally worthwhile even if they don't
score as many FPS per dollar compared to
a low-end one next time on scrapyard
wars then it's nearly gets deported
don't worry one jonatha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
