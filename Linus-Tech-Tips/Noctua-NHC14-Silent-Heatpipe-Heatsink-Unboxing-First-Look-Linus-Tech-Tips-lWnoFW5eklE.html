excited about ever since I heard about
it Noctua needs absolutely no
introduction they make some of if not
the best air coolers on the market all
right so this is a brand new product
from them that is a bit of an evolution
on their NH c12 and it is called the NHC
14 so as you might well imagine that
means we've gone from a 12 centimeter
fan to a 14 centimeter fan it uses AC
type flow design which means that this
is a downdraft cooler and you know what
I I know this one pretty well so I don't
need to really talk too much about
what's on the outside of the box and I
know there's going to be lots of
mounting accessories and fans and all
kinds of stuff inside here that we're
going to have to have a look at so I'll
have plenty of time to yak about all the
different things about this product so
the first box inside we find a set of
Intel mounting hardware and I've said
this before but it's been a long time
since not to has released something new
so I'm going to say it again
I love knocked with mounting hardware it
is some of the best on the market and
here I'm just going to show you guys
something I mean even though their
coolers are big and heavy they're
mounting hardware is built like a tank I
mean look at this thing it's got a thick
thick rubber coating so no matter what
kind of components are mounted on the
back of your motherboard PC be they're
not going to pierce through there and
make contact with the metal and short
anything out they've got a removable
rubber piece here so that makes room for
an integrated backplate if your CPU has
one all right
so for example LGA 1156 does have one so
you'll have to pull that out and you put
this on the rubber makes contact with
the back your board very nice the
overall build quality of all Noctua
products is just outstanding
alright long here we've got more like
solid solid metal pieces once you attach
this thing it's not coming off no matter
what okay here we have a manual which
shows you Intel and AMD mounting
instructions it is a color some semi
color manual alright very very detailed
it's very easy to install these things I
could pretty much do it with my eyes
despite the fact that they are massive
coolers here we have the ante mounting
hardware real simple for that one and
then we have the shared pieces so in
here you're going to actually find a lot
of different accessories that are all
very useful in their own ways and I'm
going to tell you all about them so
first we have low noise fan adapters as
well as ultra-low noise fan adapters so
those are 7 and 5 volt fan adapters
depending on how quiet you want your fan
and how much cooling you want out of it
next we have a splitter so that's so you
can plug both fans because this is a
dual fan cooler into the single CPU
motherboard header then we have some
anti vibration mounts for a fan we have
some non anti-vibration mounts for a fan
and we have some anti vibration little
bracket II guys here actually sure what
those ones do I haven't seen those
before not to a case bad even not to his
case badges are like better built than
anyone else look at that it's like metal
it's like a piece of metal awesome okay
next we have packing okay Oh
cameraman somehow ended up on the other
side of me I'm not quite sure when that
happened while we were filming this
video alright now this is it I haven't
seen this in person yet so I'm actually
like pretty stoked right now so I can
already see there's a six heat pipes
built into this cooler sorry about that
Esther filled up my memory card and I
didn't realize it was full because I
didn't know there was a bunch of footage
on my camera so I deleted all her stuff
hopefully she didn't eat it and I'm just
trying to figure out how to get this box
open love environmentally friendly
packaging and you can see that noctua
has not a single piece of foam in their
entire package it's all perfectly
recyclable corrugated cardboard love it
alright so the first thing we see is the
bottom view of the heat sink where we
will find six heat pipes this is not a
heat pipe direct touch heat sink
although that's never stopped Noctua
from being at or near the very top of
the performance charts in the past
because they do use a very high quality
heat pipe as well as the pretty much the
best menu
during that I'd seen everything is
always really really really tight to
whatever their specification happens to
be just looks really sharp
okay so right on the bottom you can see
we've got our six heat pipes we've got
the whole base is a slot soldered
together all right you can see there's a
small fin on the bottom so I guess
you'll get a tiny tiny bit of cooling
out of that actually got trying to
figure out what that is but hold on okay
it looks like it can actually be removed
somehow okay okay sorry guys sorry guys
I got I got a little distracted there
okay so the knocked well mounting
mechanism that I that I love so much so
it's a solid piece of metal that's
actually screwed in here I've seen some
of their coolers in the past where you
actually have to attach this piece but
what you'll have to do is you installed
the mounting hardware around the outside
of whatever your CPU type is and then
you just screw these two onto the
mounting hardware that goes on to the
motherboard so how are you going to do
that you might ask because clearly
looking at it you're not going to be
able to screw that in very easily but
there is a solution not to I has thought
of everything so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys how this works and I
actually really like their system for
mounting fans too it's uh quite a bit
easier than a lot of the other ones that
I've seen you just do that okay so
they've actually built in holes here and
they give you an included screw driver
that is long enough and slim enough to
reach that's it that's their solution to
the problem so you can reach all the way
through even with that fan installed you
can access the screw and then you can
screw it in from the top just like that
very very nice
love knot to his design now they've got
a huge cooler here for what is a
downdraft CPU cooler they've got very
thick fins and they've actually used
what is traditionally knocked to a use
as a wider spacing on a lot of their
coolers but they've got a very narrow
fin spacing and I think the reason
they've done that is they've got two
high-pressure fans so while these are
not high rpm fans
these are NFP 14s
they are designed along the same lines
as the original 120 millimeter version
of this fan and that means that they've
got optimized static pressure whereas
they're not optimized for high air flow
where there's no resistance to the air
so what that means is that if you've got
a very high density heat sink you've got
two fans that's been at low rpm but are
optimized for lots of pressure you're
still going to be able to push air
through those tight fins so I'm actually
going to remove the other fan and I want
to talk a little bit about the
advantages of using a downdraft CPU
cooler versus something like the D 14
which is as far as I know to this day
the undisputed performance king of CPU
coolers so the advantage of this is that
we get most of the performance of a
monster like the D 14 and a form factor
that is a more likely to be compatible
with your case because you don't have to
deal with any clearance issues with the
side panel because the D 14th huge I
mean it's like like this tall right off
the CPU socket you also get the
advantage of cooling all the components
around your CPU now what that means is
that depending on how you position this
you're going to be able to cool your vrm
you're going to be able to cool your
Northbridge you're going to be able to
cool your RAM that sits under it and
that makes for maybe not quite as good
CPU temps like I said it doesn't perform
as well as the D 14 but it makes for
much better temperatures for all of the
other things that are around it so
you're looking at better overall system
reliability if you can keep everything
well within spec and running nice and
cool not to also build in like I've seen
some pretty cheesy approaches to
anti-vibration
I mean not to us all about silence so
they build in these little rubber mounts
that are going to to stop the fan
vibrations from being passed along to
the heatsink and then by extension the
CPU motherboard and then case so that's
a really nice touch that I've seen on a
lot of Nachtwey heat sinks and I figured
out what that what that screw is so that
screw bolts in this bracket which seems
to provide some kind of additional
support for the oh oh I get it okay so I
guess if it's on this way it may
so that it has a little bit more support
and doesn't put pressure on the heat
pipes from from the weight here and
shipping if it gets bounced around
that's another thing NCIX ships a lot of
PC systems and one of the ones that
we've had the most success with when
shipping or transporting systems is not
to uh that's one of the reasons I like
their mounting system so much so I want
to look at the Box quickly see if
there's anything I missed high clearance
mode oh yeah high clearance mode versus
low profile mode haha that's smart so
you don't have to mount two fans on here
you can do one or two so you can
actually do one on the bottom and that
turns this extreme performance heat sink
into a very low profile solution so you
can fit it even in some HT pcs as long
as you've got enough clearance or you
can put it in up on the top if that
works better for you let's say you've
got something under it like tall Ram
modules down here that you need to make
room for so now you can put the fan on
the top and then if you've got lots of
room all around then you can put on both
fans so there we go we've covered that
particular aspect of it and then we've
also got dual fan configuration yep now
we've talked about that and I think
that's pretty much everything on here oh
yeah they include their n th one thermal
compound which is pretty good stuff I
totally missed that as we were unboxing
all the accessories so thank you for
checking out the unboxing and first look
