sponsor a showcase of their shiny new
flagship the honour view 10 a phone that
takes AI super-cereal and we've got not
one but two of them here to check out so
sit back relax and enjoy the view not
that the view I said there was a chance
you'd enjoy it
so as the smartphone space continues to
mature something that we're seeing a lot
more of is AI as a way of driving the
technology forward like if you think of
all the phone features that AI touches
these days not just things like virtual
assistants and translators but even
smarter ways of processing data off of
the image sensor for example or managing
power so the view 10 uses AI for all of
that design-wise view 10 feels pretty
modern flagship II it's got an all
aluminum chassis that's available in
midnight black and in blue like we have
here but also red and gold and then on
the front you'll find a six inch edge to
edge display in the nice and wide or
tall as it were 18 by 9 aspect ratio
that seems to have pretty much taken
over which I'm personally a fan of and
then also a capacitive home button that
also acts as a fingerprint reader
something that I personally do prefer
because it allows you to unlock your
phone a little bit more conveniently
when it's just lying flat on the table
inside the phone you'll find six gigs of
RAM dual SIM functionality and 128 gigs
of expandable storage so that's all
pretty normal stuff but what's a little
less normal is the eight core Chiron 970
processor something that honor is
calling a neural network processing unit
or an NP you instead of a CPU so the
idea here is that this chip will learn
and adapt over its lifetime with honor
even going as far as to say that it will
ensure smooth leg free operation even
after 500 days of use which is pretty
attractive considering how clunky that
many phones get after just a year or so
the NP you also boasts dramatic
improvements in battery performance like
up to 21 hours of browsing from the view
10s 3750 milliamp hour battery which
combined with fast charging over USB C
should make it pretty hard to get caught
with a dead phone on to the camera or
cameras as it were the view 10 has dual
lenses on the back one 16 megapixel RGB
sensor and then a 20 megapixel
monochrome one the aperture can open up
as wide as one point
stops giving you a nice bokeh effect and
that's even without using software
enhancements like the built-in portrait
mode and wide aperture mode the software
can also use object recognition to
automatically adjust camera settings
according to what is detected in the
frame so if you point the camera at one
of the 13 object types that it
recognizes you'll actually see the
corresponding icon pop up and then the
software's knowledge of what settings
are best will even expand over time
through over-the-air updates and you can
also use the image recognition for text
so with the pre-installed Microsoft
translator app you just point the camera
at text that you don't understand and
it'll translate it instantly right on
top of the image another cool feature is
what they call image super resolution so
this basically lets you zoom super far
into a picture without it getting
ridiculously blurry because it's all
back to AI again it's trying to smooth
out the pixels for you on the fly
flipping over to the 13 megapixel selfie
camera we can experiment with beauty
mode which I obviously do not need at
all but what it will attempt to do is
automatically detect your gender and
then offer desirable image enhancements
not everyone cares about selfies though
when it comes to gaming the vo 10 comes
with game suite which helps balance
power savings and gaming performance and
then also allows you to turn off
notifications and navigation keys so you
don't get interrupted when you're
playing games and then on the subject of
navigation keys the view 10 includes a
few neat alternatives to increase
productivity so you can hide your on
screen navigation buttons and navigate
just by tapping and swiping the
capacitive home button or you can use
this nifty navigation dock or the nav
nipple as I like to call it another cool
productivity trick is using your
knuckles to initiate split-screen you
just knock and draw a line across the
screen and nearly enough it can actually
tell if you use your finger or your
knuckle which is for
so that's it that's a quick showcase
