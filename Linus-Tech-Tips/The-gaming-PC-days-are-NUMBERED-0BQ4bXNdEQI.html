goal they're gonna kill off the
traditional gaming PC and do it without
gamers either caring or in many cases
even noticing how is it that they intend
to do something like that without
becoming about as popular as this
blanket I'm sitting on here in their
Lobby well that's a terrific question
and they sponsored our trip down to
their San Francisco office to answer it
for you this is a shadow ghost basically
what it is is a super low powered Linux
computer that leverages the power of the
cloud to enable it to perform like a
high performance gaming rig so right
here I've got one of these and I'm
running rise of the Tomb Raider at very
high settings 1080p and getting an
excess of a hundred frames per second
and this is all on a seven watt bandless
ARM based system it's not exactly a new
idea though is it
thin clients which are low spec machines
that use a remote server to handle
heavier workloads have been around for
decades and even in the gaming space
this is old news on live the world's
first commercial cloud gaming service
was announced at GDC nearly 10 years ago
but as we're about to see not every
cloud is created equal so let's head
over to shadows west coast USA data
center to check it out now to say that
cloud gaming is a bit of a nebulous
maybe even buzzword where the term would
be a gross understatement you could ask
a dozen different people all smart and
informed people and get 13 different
answers but what exactly it means um
some of them might only see the value in
synchronizing savestates across devices
others might see it as a way to augment
limited local storage for high-quality
assets I mean I still remember
nvidia launched the grid which was this
server full of special GPUs that could
be virtualized or carved up to allow
multiple users to run off of a single
card for later workloads and when
Microsoft first launched the Xbox one
when they were talking up this hybrid
approach even to 3d rendering where some
of it would be done locally and some in
the data center and then the resulting
combined image would be displayed on
your TV but a shadow is fundamentally
different from what anyone else is doing
right now so rather than using an
existing cloud platform like AWS they're
actually building out their own
co-located data centers like the one
we're standing next to right now so
everything inside this cage actually
belongs to them and when you subscribe
to their service you're not getting like
a a chunk of a GPU or a Netflix like
interface with a limited selection of
games you can stream inside of every
single one of these custom-built boxes
it's sixteen CPU cores
48 gigs of system memory and for
performance great GPUs typically GTX
1080s or Quattro p5 thousands which are
about equivalent in gaming performance
shadow is then using their own tuned
version of Red Hat's KVM hypervisor
running on Linux to allocate the CP
and the RAM using virtualization and
then when it comes to graphics each
shadow actually gets its own dedicated
GPU pass through to it this is actually
really similar tact to what we use in
our seven gamers one CPU project a
couple of years ago and for gamers who
subscribe what it means is near bare
metal performance with support for 1080p
144 Hertz or even 4k 60 Hertz gaming at
least in theory because the truth of the
matter is you can have all the hardware
in the world but the user experience is
still gonna suck unless you can solve
the problem with cloud services the
latency and shadow knows this and takes
it really seriously so as part of their
ongoing journey to get the delay between
a mouse-click and an action taking place
on screen as close to local gaming as
possible they've even developed their
own special hardware this right here is
called a Betty and what it basically
does is issue a command to their
software that's just a space bar input
that inverts the color of the screen
then it uses this sensor on the back to
measure the delay so to put their claims
to the test I actually asked them to
give me a copy of their latency testing
software and put it on my machine then
install their shadow client on my
machine so we can do an apples-to-apples
comparison here a wired connection is
ideal but you can get away with 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi assuming that you have a
good fairly recent access point but they
really don't recommend 2.4 gigahertz I
mean especially some of the older stuff
it could be 20 milliseconds of latency
just between your Wi-Fi card and your
router which is really gonna hurt the
gaming experience
ok so we're all set up we've got their
latency in site dot exe here so we're
running this locally on the machine
we're gonna do our multiple tests and
here we go
all right
91 milliseconds now we are going to use
a shadow machine so this is running off
of bat data center one of the racks in
that data center that we were just at so
fire up latency inside here
or what did we get about 91 let's go
ahead no more truth
okay so the long and short of this is
and remember that these are fairly ideal
conditions they've got a pretty decent
connection to here and we are not far
from the data center the long and short
of it is it adds only about five
milliseconds of total latency if the
server is running on the same local
network and that's for all of the image
capture encoding transferring and
decoding and then plus whatever your
internet latency is here and these are
really impressive results like I wasn't
expecting that I was expecting at least
the five to ten milliseconds on top of
what we got natively but depending on
how tight everything is and whether that
latency can be hidden by the refresh
rate of the monitor itself you can end
up with the same results remotely so
those results are really impressive and
it's no accident shado believes that
it's their tuning of both the hardware
and the software at every link in the
chain that gives them their key
advantage everything is tunes to
optimize latency for example the routers
that they use are BGP routers these
allow them to find and hold the most
optimal path to the end user
rather than fighting through the traffic
at a typical internet exchange and they
have been hard at work building their
own software clients for a wide variety
of platforms so that you can access your
shadow on any device that you want
they've even that is to work with folks
like Logitech to ensure that you can use
whatever peripherals you want
so this racing wheel equipped demo right
here force feedback and everything has
project cars - looking pretty slick and
it's running off of that same data
center that we were in before back in
the other demo room things get even more
interesting though so this is the same
shadow ghost that you guys saw before
but as you might have realized by now
it's actually totally optional so let's
say for example I'm tired of looking at
a small screen and I want to play this
same game on my TV
I grabbed my controller press this
button and bippity Boppity there it is
now i'm on their android client this is
an Android powered TV and I am actually
decoding the signal using the processor
built right into my TV I'm using this
controller a little something like that
crazy right
okay now I've been gaming for a while or
whatever I'm hungry I want to run over
to the kitchen I don't want to put down
my game easy solution thank you
got an Android tablet here got my
controller paired to it now I'm playing
on this that's how quickly it switches
now let's say uh okay I don't know my
battery ran out or something now I'm
gonna switch to my phone here we are
this is the iOS app now running that
same game that we left off on from
before completely seamless switching
then oh I don't know why I dropped my
iPhone who knows what I got to keep
coming up with more and more contrived
reasons for me to keep switching devices
here and as a last resort I go okay I
guess I'll I'll game on the MacBook here
go ahead and plug in my mouse and oh
look they already press the button for
me thank you for that and there we are
now we're running on the Mac and
actually the implementation here is
particularly interesting to me because
not only have they actually found a
purpose for the touch bar so you can
change some of your options you can
adjust your bitrate some kind of cool
stuff like that but I'm gonna go ahead
and put the desktop here because this is
crazy
with a simple three finger swipe I can
go from a full fat Mac OS experience
high performance natively running
obviously to a full fat Windows 10
experience now this one isn't running
natively
but imagine the things that you could do
with this kind of functionality I mean
this is not just for gaming anymore you
could install and run anything like if
you were let's say you were editing a
video in Adobe Premiere you could do
your heavy lifting on the shot
and then you could even save your
battery life since your laptop CPU is
hardly doing anything it's just running
over the network so sounds pretty cool
then right without the upfront
investment that comes with a typical
gaming tower for 35 bucks a month you're
getting a gaming PC with a gigabit
internet connection that RIT's through
modern games and not only that that
shadow promises will continue to receive
upgraded Hardware over time so you're
always gaming at high settings what's
the downside okay I mean nothing in life
is perfect so one is image compression
while your shadow can fine-tune its
encoding settings for your connection on
the other side
not all decoders can deliver the same
experience and you guys might have
noticed this especially with the TV from
my experience h.265 at their maximum
supported bitrate of 50 to 70 megabit
per second delivered the best experience
with minimal compression artifacts and
blocking even on challenging color
gradients like the sky but not every
internet connection or device will be
able to handle this so you're gonna have
to try it out for yourself naturally of
course we have a link below for that
including a $10 off offer code for the
first month and in much the same way
that even in a future where ride-sharing
services have mostly overtaken
individual car ownership there are still
going to be people who want to own a
Lamborghini and rock around in it on the
weekend as cloud gaming continues to
gain traction among mainstream users
there will still be people probably some
of what you're watching this video whose
bleeding-edge desires outstrip what's
possible through the cloud and notable
limitations today include HDR
multi-monitor support and VR gaming the
last of which is particularly sensitive
to latency which isn't to say though
that they won't be working on those
things and that there might not be new
gaming experiences that are worth
trading them for I mean here's a
hypothetical for you what if datacenter
technology continued to advance in such
a way that entirely new gaming
experiences
could be created like massive or
photo-realistic environments that simply
couldn't be rendered by one or two GPUs
in SLI in a box next to you if all that
cost you was 10 to 30 milliseconds much
of which could be made up with faster
display technologies in the coming years
things would start to get really
interesting wouldn't they in the
meantime though if you want to try it
out check out the link to shadow dot
tech down below a shadow is just 35
bucks a month with no usage fees outside
your regular data rates and they've got
seven data centers worldwide with two
more coming I would love to hear your
guys's thoughts in the comments below so
thanks again to shadow for sponsoring
our trip down here and thanks to you
guys for watching if you just like this
video if you guys all know where that
button is but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below also down
there is our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
