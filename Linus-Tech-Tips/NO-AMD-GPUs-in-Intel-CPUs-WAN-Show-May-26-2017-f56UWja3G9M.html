head hey are we can it no no you're not
no now you're to center stage okay this
is the lightest show not so late note on
the ranch oh okay then okay fine come on
okay come on in here like leave come on
in here buddy we were doing some weird
stuff today we were doing some real
weird stuff today it involved drag yeah
it involved lipstick you're part of drag
it's like moustache it involved fake
mustaches it involved a cell phone and
taking pictures yeah actually what not
it's not as crazy as it sounds you know
working on a on a piece for honor for
the honor 6x phone and actually I think
it's I think it's going to be pretty fun
if he seems like it's going to be pretty
entertaining have you actually read the
script or you just kind of do I had no
idea okay so every time we go to shot I
was like I don't know what I'm doing
like I actually had no clue okay so the
concept behind the video is it's kind of
like it's like the videos that I've
hosted in the past where I compared my
generation to my kids generation and
sort of the differences then versus now
okay well this time it's now versus then
yeah so I'm looking at my generation
versus the baby boomers and the way that
we use technology yeah some of the ways
that like you knowing technology might
think certain things that they do is
just silly and unnecessary and slow or
whatever solutions that are obvious to
us you and not as obvious to our parents
and our grandparents so I be a pretty
fun little video it's it's a lot better
than we made it sound kind of lame well
I made it well part of the part of the
added bonus is that like so far at least
all of the characters are played by
Linus and I yes
so Linus was played by Linus and then
like I don't know is it just grandma my
grandma is played by me yeah my aunt is
played by him my dad is definite
we kind of like full monty python' on
like the female characters awning okay
and they got me a medium dress well okay
i don't even fit and medium oh I guess
it wasn't for me but like it I don't
even fit medium men's clothes they
bought me a medium dress you volunteered
cram yourself into it I can still feel
it under here there was like barely room
for him to stop the friend yeah yeah the
good news was it was so tight that you
were able to stuff the front without
needing a bra yes
yeah remaining microfiber hahaha
anyway we've got a great show for you
guys this week and Oh for crying out
loud I didn't change the name of the
bloody stream again because it ah yeah
the flow party for party saying dig dig
and garsh darn dammit the wet and the
wind show um
heck okay do you want to tell them what
topics we got no your no I do the the
Intel Intel is going to be doing some
stuff with Thunderbolt 3 they can bring
bring it to more things and I think
they're like opening it up a little bit
so it should be more common which is
really good that's exciting yeah also
there has been a squashed rumor AMD will
not be licensing graphics shifts Intel
not going to be a thing Google has made
the ultimate marketing tool which is way
creepier than it sounds although you
might have seen that coming
and then Intel has well Intel not
necessarily but someone has some
benchmarks of the Intel's 2900 X and a
gigabyte X 299 or s gaming 7 and we have
those there are some very interesting
specs in that league so without further
ado let's roll the intro that works with
music it will it's been doing pretty
good lately
I guess we'll have no idea
the glare like they finally arrived on
time to Orlando but they're probably in
like other time zones and don't realize
that we're actually like almost Canal
commit because they think we're eight
minutes early because it's the access
daylight savings out of 52 minutes hey
we appreciate your confidence hahaha you
guys are uh you guys are wonderful yeah
there's nothing I can do about the fan
this razor blade this is my old blade
because I accidentally left my backpack
at work this razor blade is like super
not thrilled also there's more
background noise in general in the
warehouse right now because as some of
you doubted actually there were a lot of
comments when I forget who posted on
social the picture of the empty
warehouse stood like why would you post
a picture of the warehouse before you
moved in now and we're like oh oh
because that's what it looks like right
now
so this place is a construction zone it
is going to be oh they thought it was
like a nostalgia pick yeah no that's
that like torn apart mess is the
warehouse currently yeah and the
upstairs is full of like pretty much
everything that was in that part of the
warehouse
both Colton and Nick so the whole thing
where they're in like a sales office
that's like clearly a one-person sized
office and they're both in there that's
because we don't have any room to put
them anywhere else or that's what we're
we're renovating so we're updating the
sets we are we're building out a
mezzanine that will okay so it was
originally supposed to be a mezzanine
for storage of like yeah cases and
monitors and boxes okay that actually
takes up a ridiculous amount of space
after a while yeah and it like becomes a
problem because you can't really get rid
of this stuff so gotta put a new
somewhere and then it turned into no
while we make that actual office space
because it was an opportunity to deal
with a couple of problems that had crept
up on us two bathrooms is actually not
really quite enough you know it's
you know let's say okay let's say a
couple people at LMG go out for dinner
the night before and let's say oh they
both get a bad case of the Wow I got to
sit in the bathroom for a long time at a
time well a third person has no way to
use the bathroom so I needed another
bathroom we are getting to the point
where there's like sometimes lineups of
more than one person waiting and for the
microwave yeah
so we kind of needed another like
kitchenette or a bigger one but like
obviously we can't go back and like do
that now that would that's not a thing
yeah no we did actually discuss putting
another kitchen on the other side of the
same wall so we wouldn't have to redo
any of the plumbing there has to be a
lot easier but but now that we're going
to have this space and it can serve it
makes sense more to have a somewhere
else yeah it'd be easier to do it here
so there's that and then there was one
person in particular and I'm not going
to name any names
everyone's asked I'm somebody who really
wanted a shower a shower we are giving
one we're getting a shower
Oh what the the timing the timing yeah
it's a funny story like he might not be
here that long
low plain media is probably going to get
its own face it's going to like finally
won't have myself it's going to be a gen
KF like owner Ville space there's no way
it's going to have like nice facilities
because I mean we don't know how fast
the company is going to grow the last
thing we're going to do is like invest
heavily into you're dating a space only
to be like oh good boy that was a great
sex week yeah yeah um so I'll just have
to come here and shower no there will
not be a fire pole and yes you're you
are more than welcome to shower an hour
not monitored shower anytime you want
babe I'm looking with it um all right so
why don't we jump into our first tech
topic of the day yeah this I I you know
what I fell for it I did a little bit
too I fortunately I think because it
would have been pretty cool
so we were both like you know what sure
yep I I was down for so so what made
this rumor kind of credible and it was
that AMD was going to be licensing tips
to Intel for onboard graphics what made
it somewhat credible to me was that
Intel and NVIDIA don't really work that
closely together anymore it was it was
okay it was rumor and and the rumor was
because of a previous previous licensing
deal between Intel and NVIDIA that
expired in March and it was basically
suggesting that Intel was licensing
graphics IP from Nvidia and that deal
had expired and rather than reach a new
deal with Nvidia they had worked with
ATI Technologies group which owned by
AMD but but sort of a separate unit to
make sure that they weren't going to
have any trouble with their own graphic
chips and you know getting getting
chased down due to patent infringement
or whatever the case may be and it all
kind of like it all kind of made made
sense sort of except that I know that
Intel actually has invested very heavily
in their own graphics yeah probably
doesn't a lot of their own patents and
at this point for them to go ahead with
what the rumor suggested and that was
that Intel CPUs would have powered by
Radeon graphics inside which was
actually pens like pretty awesome that's
I think again world why we sort of
believe it to a certain degree well it
didn't sound completely impossible and
it would have yeah super cool but it's
also like it you know I can see why not
because intel has invested so heavily in
their own graphics IP that for them to
just kind of go okay yeah well know what
you know what forget it we're just going
to use AMD tech does seem a little hard
to believe especially when most folks
aren't really complaining about Intel
onboard graphics these days the other
reason that you know looking back on it
it that it doesn't make sense and this
this is this is ultimately where the
rumor
squash so that's the article of fortune
and that's where you know from my
perspective I'm looking at going oh yeah
Intel's got still whether you like it or
not still the best instruction for clock
and they've got the highest clock speeds
available on their chips so having an
Intel CPU with AMD onboard graphics
would be kind of the best of both worlds
but dr. su from AMD came out and said
look we're not looking at enabling a
competitor to compete against our
products it's not about how do we sell
more products or how do we have IP and
markets where we're not currently
selling products AMD just basically
straight-up said even if Intel wanted it
they're not looking to put a in these
graphics technology which is good on
Intel CPUs they're going to keep it on
AMD's CPUs and for now those products
are frankly not that compelling because
AMD's got their graphics technology on
older series ap use that are running
just what is not in terms of months or
years really old architectural II but in
terms of how much better the Zen core is
really old architectural II products so
when they bring us Zen core ap use all
of a sudden I I think mine and Luke's
excitement about having Radeon graphics
on Intel CPUs doesn't really matter as
much because you'll be able to get
Radeon graphics on a Zen core CPU so you
know I was amped for it not a thing but
I'm not that disappointed so a lot of
people are freaking out about and
there's like hashtag say fluke in the
chat and stuff I'm not like it's not
dying yeah and like I'll still be around
like I don't have any intent to not do
when show and like I'm still planning on
doing some videos here and there
I'm definitely beyond VR stuff hopefully
when it gets you know like more
interesting and better and then like I
have some videos coming down the chain
if you have any here help me out if you
have any like really weird
but kind of interesting or unheard-of
but neat technology things that you know
of just hit me up on Twitter down over
there which that's verging out we saved
Luke yeah you did it reddit Oh terrible
what do we got for our next topic
almoost on okay this is cool though
because okay now the last one is a
little bit disappointing because we both
kind of wanted to happen because those
would have been really really really
cool processors I personally would have
liked to see them in laptops but this
one does seem to be happening don't
believe it's a rumor Intel's plan to
Thunderbolt three all the things so
Thunderbolt 3 still hasn't gone
mainstream which is been frustrating for
a lot of people due to a combination of
high cost and low availability now Intel
is taking two steps to accelerate the
adoption of Thunderbolt 3 they're
integrating funderbolt 3 into Intel CPUs
finally yes thank you which is super
awesome I mean the fact that it was so
expensive to add to the motherboard
meant that it only existed on the super
high-end products and so you were stuck
with it just being like nice tastic for
people who are willing to invest a bunch
of money into a premium board and in
many cases buy an additional add-on
module and in terms of lowering cost
this is like not better but like better
in certain ways next year they are
making the Thunderbolt protocol
specification available to third-party
chip makers royalty-free oh you know
what's really funny about this is I had
spent so much time talking about
Thunderbolt 3 as like one of the only
key differentiators that I could think
of between buying Intel and buying AMD
now that Rison exists because whether
you have a specific use for it
today or not it's a really cool
technology and having the expandability
of a Thunderbolt 3 port on any device is
not something that I would say no to you
never know how things are going to go
down for example I'm working on a test
bench right now that's got dual graphics
cards a 10 gigabit NIC and a red rocket
X accelerator in it it has six PCI
Express slots if I wanted to put
anything else in there you know what hey
being able to connect it via thunder
yeah like let's say I had like a
professional audio capture device or
ordinary something yeah a nice high
speed low latency daisy-chain will
interface I'm not going to say no to
that and the same thing goes for laptops
a lot of people don't think funderbolt 3
is that big of a deal oh yeah sorry that
was that was very disappointing we will
talk about that after but a lot of
people don't think Thunderbolt 3 is that
big of a deal on a laptop but I'm
looking at it going you're not thinking
three years out when some new you know
hot shiz thing happens and you want to
be able to connect it the other thing
you're not thinking about is that while
external graphics enclosures don't make
a ton of sense right now while the the
cheap ones use proprietary interfaces
like the Alienware graphics graphics
booster whatever they call it anyway
it's boost it performed really really
well in our test graphics amplifier um
like the Alienware it's almost like 200
bucks
but the razor core is like 400 or it's
500 something like that
okay that won't be true forever there
are already cheaper ones on the market
and that's only going to continue to
happen so three years down the line so
people look at a nigga what you're going
to spend $1500 on a laptop
another $500 on an enclosure and another
$500 on a graphics card that on any
graphics card that would actually be
faster than what's in your laptop no of
course not you're going to spend $1500
on the laptop use a GPU that's in there
and then three years down the line
instead of spending another $1500 on a
laptop so that you can game you're going
to spend
200 bucks or 150 bucks on an enclosure
and by then graphics technology will be
such that you could spend a hundred and
fifty bucks on a graphics card and will
be better than what's in your laptop
that is the point that people are
missing with Thunderbolt III so having
it is a total bonus and for me
so AMD announced that they're going to
be doing mobile Zen based CPUs soon that
to me was going to be a real bummer for
investing in an AMD laptop but now this
potentially changes everything let's
talk about let's talk about Microsoft
not thinking Thunderbolt 3 is a big deal
yeah so they brought us to China which
was super interesting and why we figure
out what's coming out and I'm pretty
excited because Linus had actually oddly
very recently made a video about the
surface pro 4 which was weird because it
was a super late video it was like
wildly late like this video came about
two months ago I think so his opinions
on it were very fresh and lots of
comments under the video were very fresh
in terms of like there's a new product
coming out so I I have like everything
ready I'm like ok all right I've been
told by them that like they've directly
addressed claims and stuff I'm like man
this is really exciting I like feel like
I know what's coming and I feel like
like one of the quotes that you said in
surface pro 4 video was that you feel
like the service pro 4 was the first
time that the surface pro lined up with
microsoft's vision for what it was
supposed to be yeah so I was like here
we go one of my lines was literally like
and this is where they take it from
there and I was like all pretty excited
and then - his biggest complaints in my
opinion that happened in that video were
all i/o based there was a micro SD card
slot instead of a full SD card slot that
didn't change there's still a micro SD I
think it's SD XD SD XC card slot and
then the i/o was microphone power the
surface dock the connector into the
keyboard mini DP and a USB 3 type a port
that's all it was before and that is
exactly what it is now the reason why I
remember is because I just made the
freaking video about it
no type-c no additional type a going to
plug in like a mouse and a flash drive
at the same time you're boned just I
don't know yeah yeah
and then the pen isn't included in
anymore the pen is so much better now
which is super cool the pen is
absolutely like drastically better now
right and you could that's another
interesting thing you could just buy the
pen because it's backwards compatible
and use it with your pro four and that's
probably what a lot of people yeah
because the pen is what it's like four
times as precise it now has like tilt
functionality and it latency is way
lower it's the lowest latency input pen
that there is like pen super cool there
you go join the dead doesn't have like
15 new things about it that are better
than any other pen I wish can we call it
the pen 15 yeah I would love that
I would love that if they just didn't
acknowledge it at all a straight face
here's 15 things about the Microsoft 10
that are the best I feel like you know
you know how must going to line up the s
and the 3 and the X yeah I feel like he
if he released a pen well no he wanted
it to be e and Ford
screwed him on it that's why we why we
ended up with a 3 X he wasn't alright I
don't man model e and then they said it
was too close Model T or whatever yeah
ridiculous
well then though I thought they had a
model e I thought that was the problem
I'm not much of a car guy so it's hard
for me to necessarily remember this
stuff yeah is there a for got to do or
model e yeah yeah there you go
so that's why that's why they wouldn't
let him get away with it but that's okay
you know a smart guy like mas he can he
can figure out how to get around that
you some wheat speak why not speaking of
smart guys like musk how stoked do you
think he is on this the original article
here is from futurism accom and this is
some sky man creepy yes
right about now you guy I'm going to get
this in switched Ariel this is some
crazy
business the headline is Google's new AI
is better at creating AI than the
company's engineers I hope that was I
linked the wrong things which this is
the auto ml project and artificial
intelligence that assists in the
creation of other AIS this is exactly
what Terminator told us not to do
exactly yeah like to a t-cell auto ml is
a controller neural net that can propose
a child model architecture which can
then be trained and evaluated for
quality on a particular task Wow so so
far they've used this auto ml tech to
design networks for image and speech
recognition tasks so the system matched
Google's experts for image recognition
and exceeded them in speech recognition
designing better architectures than the
humans were able to create this is one
thing that I'm interested in though was
that ever
or were they put in like a time window
like we're the humans and the AI both
given an hour or a day or was it like
what the humans have been up to mail up
until now be honest I haven't looked
much for the latency but I that I
haven't seen that information kind of
anywhere because that's actually a
pretty interesting difference right
there were a couple more quotes on it I
can have a look and see if I can find
anything about because I'm not I'm not
trying to say that it wouldn't be
possible ever for them to do it but I
feel like right now it would be on like
a similar timed test I don't think so it
really doesn't sound that way because
like did they because we're saying
speech recognition right yeah so did
this AI make a better speak recognition
thing than what Google is using
currently right now because if not then
it didn't beat it provides proposals its
worded in a way that I can't like 100
be certain it is a little bit tough to
tell exactly exactly what they mean but
either way it sounds it sounds
terrifying so basically here's the
here's the quote if we succeed we think
this can inspire new types of neural
nets and make it possible for
non-experts to create neural nets
tailored to their particular needs
allowing machine learning to have a
greater impact for everyone
oh I'm sure machine learning is gonna
have an impact yep
good yeah I like you know that's funny I
was never really much of a Doctor Who
guy and then I like binge watched the
entire like like 20 whatever Doctor Who
like not not 20th century Doctor Who the
20 years something yeah and I was just
like this is great I think there must be
one of the only people who really liked
the first doctor from from the new
generation yeah I don't remember his
name anymore but I thought he was I
actually thought he was pretty awesome
but anyway that's neither here nor there
but it makes me think of the episode
where the cars like drive people off
into the into the water and stuff like
that because they're they're using their
they turn they're taking over the world
electronic devices and all that kind of
thing like I just ha I'm gonna be on and
shot in all cup of letters the first
doctor was awful
he was not awful
remember too though that I'm coming at
it from a really different perspective
as someone who never watched the old
show and basically other than knowing
that it was something to do with a blue
phone booth yeah knew nothing about it I
know there's a blue phone booth I know
there's a crazy screwdriver and I know
we haven't watched after him no I think
he like
dies sometimes and then he like glows
and then another one shows up or does he
like like past the screwdriver forward
is it a different screwdriver is it a
sonic screwdriver
no no cam sad now you got to watch some
Doctor Who bro it's actually okay it's
really camp but it's like actually
really good it's really good you'll like
it
you're like um all right let's that's
all I know about the only you know it's
funny I'm like I'm leaning on your
really hard even though I went so long
without watching it yes the reason I'm
doing it is that's what made me fine
okay okay like Firefly okay okay fine
yeah hi I'll watch it okay I watch it to
break third fandoms go that way it's
terrifying cackling like Firefly was
okay because there's only one season but
like when someone comes to you and
they're like this is a really great show
there's nine frickin you know 20 episode
of things I don't going right and you're
just like this is like a week of my life
that I'm committed to this if I like
again do you like usually I wait till
shows they're home free
I still haven't watched any Game of
Thrones me neither because I'm waiting
for the head okay I think I watched like
the first season but I don't remember I
read the first book yeah I thought they
weren't all written and I was like flip
desk nope I own them all on Mike Kim I
didn't know there was books usually I
read the book first right I ended up
watching a couple episodes I was like
yeah this shows weird as hell but pretty
good so I ended up watching the whole
first season and I'm like I'll wait till
all the seasons are done then I figured
out those books and I bought the books
and then was like oh my goodness there's
more books coming damaged it's me so
we've got exactly the same I've actually
gone one step further I already own the
blu-rays for like the first time see it
will HHM be it look to them it HMV
disappeared shut down I went in and like
seasons of Game of Thrones for like $14
or something on blu-ray like it was
ridiculous that's really good so I
bought like $400 worth of blu-rays I got
so much good stuff just and I was just
like yeah okay well I yeah
the good news is I have lots of
time to rip it all tonight lek server
because I won't be watching it for a
very long time yes yeah um all right
what else Oh Google has made the
ultimate marketing tool yeah so this is
what I actually thought we were checking
before the original article here is from
bleeping computer Tom and it'll come up
eventually
way to go bleeping computer this is yeah
this is all I timed it just wrong it is
super creepy the the last one was like
oh my god they're going to take over the
world that's really scary this one's
like oh my god this is the creepiest
thing freaking ever what the actual hell
is this yeah at the annual Google
marketing next conference the Mountain
View search and advertising giant
announced a new service that will let
advertisers track and tie offline credit
card payments with ongoing marketing
campaigns so this is going to be this
system will be driven by machine
learning and combines data from Google's
regular campaigns with third-party
partnerships which capture 70% of credit
and debit transactions in the US yeah
this is terrible yeah
the good news is that and there's like
geolocation and everything to tie in
everything so like though they'll find
mood patterns where like if something is
happening like say your phone is blowing
up from certain contacts and you tend to
make certain impulse purchases when
certain people are blowing up your phone
they'll like I'm not even kidding though
flowers yeah yeah they'll throw
advertisements at you for different
services and whatnot and of course
they're analyzing exactly what's being
said even so they don't even have to
look for it to blow up they could just
look like they could know before you
know any of those ads ready our
anniversary is coming up and boom sky
helicopters ads actually though they'll
know you're like target price probably -
from your payment history so they'll
give you like a value appropriate ad
I mean at what point do we just live in
capsules like the matrix and we just get
like when we want it we get what can a
rejection of happiness we want it we get
my need for just minutes into our you
know what's really funny is I'm probably
and I'm just going to kind of jump in
here and you can correct me if I'm wrong
I'm probably the most digit eeper Sununu
yeah and I'm really fidgety too but
that's not I don't even know why they're
called that I have never been even
tempted to try a fidget spin it no
because it's too it's too uh like basic
one demand I don't get it like I like I
fidget with whatever's in front of me I
love like like I used to drive Nick
light freakin crazy on our conference
calls because we used to do them in the
land show room back when we were at the
old Langley place and there was a boom
arm that had the microphone for the show
above where we'd sit on the couch
because that was the couch we'd sit on
the couch and we do our conference calls
together and so whatever was in my hand
I would put my arm out and I would throw
it up over the pole to myself I remember
that and catch it to myself and I would
like hit the boom arm from time to time
and people who are on the call with us a
oh well sorry did you guys and never be
just like hahaha but yeah I just don't
get it like I think what the thing is
you're fidgeting and like I think we
have similar kind you'll like grab
something and like throw it around and
you're like really interactive with like
this isn't this is too boring yeah going
on it doesn't that doesn't really it's
way too bored with that said have you
tried one no okay so maybe before we I
know yeah least you know if you're gonna
world that I want to if you're gonna say
crack cocaine is bad you should at least
try it first okay just so like it's on
record no obviously not
no obviously not but don't change the
gift yeah anyway back to the marketing
next to Google attribution so that's
what the service is going to be called
it aggregates details about the ads
displayed on your phone
the sights and time that you visited
them what you've searched in Google uses
to your location and Wi-Fi information
from your phone to tell if you've gone
to the mall or walks into a store that
sells that product and finally with the
integration of payment data from
third-party partnerships Google will
know if you've bought that product and
will report it in the advertisers
AdWords dashboard it's driven by machine
learning and combines data from ok we
already set that part holy freaking crap
with that said if Google knew that my
wife's birthday was coming up and
suggested sky helicopters that would be
pretty cool we finally went on our
helicopter ride oh cool
yeah so I bought it for her back in
October in a bit which is when her
birthday is and I didn't have to think
about that for a sec and it took until
now for us to do it because we've had a
very very young baby and it was kind of
like the reason for the timing the
reason for the gift the reason for
giving her a gift that I knew she
wouldn't be able to enjoy for a bit was
it was like hey hon everything is
horrible right now because we have an
infant but here's something to really
look forward to don't know what we can
lead the baby at home for a couple of
hours yeah and so we went we went flying
up into the mountains just north of the
greater the Greater Vancouver area ok
and these pictures are freaking sick so
it's actually my sister's boyfriend who
took us up there and so he's a he's a
helicopter pilot and even got us like a
small deal and frickin man we did the
sunset
yeah sure you guys won't be able to well
wow really cool it's like frickin
wilderness hold on I'm going backwards
no I'm getting to like just flying over
like the city that that's not as good oh
you guys go out but we got like way oh
yeah yeah we land on a mountaintop
that's really cool and you can just see
as far as the eye can see the entire top
now that's wrong it's like like it's
like a jagged peak but it's like
flattened out from the from the cone of
snow on the top and like you're like on
top of the world and as the Sun Goes
Down the light was like we got
perfectly so the Sun coming through kind
of a light cloud on us but blue skies
above us and is just all that one's
blurry it was just unreal middle of
nowhere this would be like a three
four-day expedition for a very
experienced Mountaineer
yeah or you can fly up there in like 20
minutes um it's pretty awful at I let me
just see if I can find like one of the
pictures we took like right when the Sun
was Sun was setting
it's like frickin unbelievable it's like
so quiet just crazy got like the
helicopter in the background there
another thing it was really expensive
like it was still like 500 bucks so it's
not the kind of present that I would buy
every year or anything you know that but
again like you know me I'm the kind of
person who does like a big gift once in
a while and then like here's some you
know breakfast or whatever yeah I like
more like more like a gesture and I
think in that case it sort of makes
sense like this sucks right now but here
like just look at this don't worry about
it let's keep going yeah it was like to
get buzzed as much for me as it was
those of us through the air through the
next six months speaking of getting
through the next six months um you know
we got a maze you shoot the lights are
you in the studio for the next six
months
so Bulger's for the land show today you
know what's funny is I actually didn't
know this until until when I was working
on
pimps my Wi-Fi out in Singapore that
ingenious in addition to making
consumer-grade stuff actually makes
enterprise-class networking gear so this
right here is the EWS 360 ap it's an
enterprise class dual band access point
ideal for large offices schools and
hospitality guests Wi-Fi access it
features 11 AC speeds and it's got a
bunch of business class features it can
operate an autonomous or manage mode
it's got a high-powered radio with a 3x3
antenna design and it's got meshing
technology built in so that means you
can actually run and obviously it's not
as good as running a wire to every
single
a pea we know but sometimes you don't
really have a choice and a mesh they
don't be very very convenient there are
so this is where they really kill it in
terms of the total cost of ownership
unlike some other enterprise access
points there are no per device license
fees and no annual subscription fees so
that's what keeps so while the AP itself
might not be that cheap compared to
another access point that's not really
the point the point is lower overall
total cost of ownership so check it over
check it out check it out over ingenious

sponsoring the show this week Mac Weldon
you look so sharp when you wear a color
I think other than the first year at CES
where you were like were you like
hahahaha you like you did it the way
that like new buy clothes we're gonna
bought an outfit yep
like not not all pants and anyway I
think that's like one of the only times
I've ever seen you dress up the collar
here though there was also Tom wait did
you say Computex Oh can't you text too
that's younger yeah so Mac Roldan
believes in smart design premium fabrics
and simple shopping even he could do it
Mac maybe like actually like they make
super comfortable underwear socks shirts
undershirts hoodies and sweatpants and
they have a line of silver underwear and
shirts that are naturally antimicrobial
which and this is a really fun fact is
actually a thing you can put silver in
your water cooling loop and it will kill
bacterial growth silver ions that's a
thing so when they laced these fabrics
with silver they actually naturally kill
the microbes that cause B oh you're
still going to sweat obviously but hey
at least it helps and like you should
still wash it out and
you know matt bouldin the only clothing
you never have to wash you heard it here
first it was a complete and utter lie
but that's but you heard it here first
anyway Matt Wilden wants you to be
comfortable so if you don't like your
first pair boxers you can keep it and
they will still refund you and not only
do their underwear socks and shirts look
good they perform well too great for
working out going to work going on dates
and just everyday life I mean basically
good clothes should be good for everyday
life yeah so go to Matt Bouldin calm and
get 20% off using promo code tech tips
that's our tip for you today
go to Mack Weldon and saving some money
another tip LTX is happening ticket
rocketdock go slash events last details
last nine seven two four six five LPS
that's two zero one seven I still don't
know why we have an URL shortner that I
also you don't know why that's fine what
the hey you want to come hang out yeah
so it's going to be on July 29th from
11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. we're going to
have the whole ltp crew there we're
going to have fun booths including the
case toss the guess how many CPUs are in
a jar and playing rocket League IRL
we're going to use MOOC not with like
the super powered card oh god there's
like actually like kits you can buy so
yeah okay
or rent rather so there'll be like I
like a whole kit so it's going to be
half way tech like we're going to have
some partners coming out and like
tacking it up like like game at 144
Hertz and 4k I think I think those guys
are coming out and then we're going to
have stuff that's just like completely
carnival like we're you know those
things with the big long bungee cord
where you like run as fast as you can as
hard as you can against the bungee cord
and then it like rips you back Oh God
so we're going to get one of those I
guess so we're just going to have just a
mishmash of like a way to vote on fun
crap to do and you come hang out with
the LPG crew tickets or 30 bucks or
there's a bigger package that includes
full plane membership and some other
cool stuff so there you go LTX is coming
alright other news topic what else we
got here
oh yes leaks so SCI software dotnet is
the original source for the leak here
and it looks like a gigabyte board
running an Intel Core i7 7,900 x10 core
CPU at 4 gigahertz base four and a half
boost was leaked AF so that is the whoo
local rank number two okay a lot of
these numbers don't mean a whole lot to
me but that's okay
20 threads 4 gigahertz Wow if that is
the actual TDP rating that is basically
Intel turning up the heat
quite literally like they have been so
conservative in the stock speeds of
their processors for so long if this 175
watt TDP is for real you are going to
need like a dual 120 millimeter liquid
cooler in order to keep this thing
boosting up which is cool which is great
so those of you done like SoundCloud
listening to the podcast which almost no
one does because we never mentioned that
it exists it's 175 watts
why are you plugging the audio version
nobody cares no teacher I think it's on
iTunes too is it yeah I think Colton set
up like an automated thing people ask me
every once when I like when you guys can
make it like a legit podcast like going
like iTunes and stuff and I'm like I
don't even know if we are not right now
hey we might already hate the LAN show
is a legit podcast I think they mean
like audio podcast well you know what oh
gee third it look at it out on iTunes
itunes ah there's a bulk a that one
didn't go up until like mid this week
well you can still you can talk about on
iTunes so it's like week old news four
days late okay we should maybe maybe
it's not automated it's probably not
automated Colton probably is doing it
manually Wow
which I appreciate his dedication but
there you go yeah the LAN show is on
iTunes
now you know it's a free download on
iTunes can you see how many people like
I've no idea
customer reviews okay hey let's read you
read some reviews great guys I've been
watching their content ever since they
started making tech videos on the
internet everybody glad to see them make
the jump to iTunes as well very
informative well done tech and Yukons
coverage a Canadian accent damn really
nice - really glad to see the land show
make its way to YouTube buddy you guys
having fun laughing at the silly state
of the world focus on technology nothing
supportive as de Canadian boys okay that
one ligament sounded like Pedro right
yeah yeah good to see that make its way
to the iTunes good idea if you can lift
it whenever you want everybody great job
guys keep up the good work there you
want everybody that legitimately said
buddy that would have been perfect I
wish it said buddy yeah but but that one
that second one that did say as they
Canadian voice and it sounded Canadian
before is that yeah though that was
pretty good so there you go if you ever
left a review I think that I think
that's all three I guess if you ever
left a review of the way I do then you
got a hard core when show call out um uh
t moody demon hunter and yoloswag ha ha
ha ha yes and there's four numbers after
it so like Yolo swag shop was taken and
now it's Yolo swag shop 1275 you know I
excuse it but I remember when like email
addresses or were were easy enough to
get unique ones were easy enough to get
that like when I met my wife I
legitimately straight-up held it against
her that her email address at the time
was sweetheart oh nine at something and
I was just like really okay I don't know
I don't know this relationships gonna be
a thing in my girlfriend's defense she
has a gmail now okay
she she got off the Yahoo train finally
oh well she wasn't that Yahoo so yeah
was not at Yahoo she was that like
email provider yeah yeah so you know she
fix it yeah sorry Emma but you're done
no she fixed it
did she fixed it that was fine uh what
else we got
AMD discusses upcoming Ram settings in
Rison so this was actually big news when
raiven was first launching that there
was pretty much nothing to adjust like
you could turn the speed up as high as
you could go and you could tighten up
primary timings but like that was it now
they are opening things up a fair bit
more so there's actually some really
great news here this is community update
number four so first of all I was
talking to my buddies over at lime tech
on raid and loved the lofty C disclosure
I am involved in potentially investing
in lime technologies anyway so I was
talking to my buds over there and they
were like this virtualization news is
good news because Rison has not been a
lot of fun in unread with virtualization
up till now so here we go they're
getting fresh support for PCI Express
access control services which primarily
enables support for manual assignment of
PCIe graphics cards within logical
containers called iommu groups so the
hardware resources blah blah blah can be
dedicated to virtual machines so this is
for GPU pass-through and this is what
projects like seven gamers one CPU have
been all about without ACS support 3d
accelerated graphics in the VM was like
not going to be a thing so this is
freaking awesome really good with ACS
support is also possible to split so
you're talking about this a to GPU
system such that host Linux OS and a
Windows VM could both have dedicated
graphics exactly what we're talking
about frickin awesome
also what's next for memory so added
dividers from memory clocks such a ddr4
4000 good luck getting that running
command rate these come in and a bunch
of secondary timings so there you go
pretty cool Wow really cool all the
things that's a pretty huge up
all the freaking things so you won't get
any of this functionality until your
motherboard manufacturer bakes it into a
UEFI update but it's good to know that
these things are being worked on and
again this comes down to like us not
necessarily being that comfortable
saying go buy Rison now but us also
having the confidence to give the the
technology a positive a positive spin in
our review because we were sure that
given a little bit of time AMD was going
to get this stuff worked on so I am I am
flipping excited for what they're doing
right now over there oh wow
Thank You Ivan yeah yeah you guys may or
may not have noticed but Ivan like kind
of is sleeping in a corner of the
warehouse right now yeah I don't know
how many of you will actually even know
who Ivan is but he's the og og crazy
Russian as well I used to always refer
to him as back on in the NCIX tech tip
days and I've been informed it's not
Russian it's soviet Canadian ok ok I got
it
oh gee crazy Russian cuz that's what I
called you not like I was referring back
to was something that I said that was
wrong yeah perfect
you too bro ok um anyway she brought us
water
she's good people honey mine doesn't
have any ice on it but I think mine has
like construction stuff you know it's a
it's a learning it's a learning
experience um what else we got 26 more
parameters of levity blah oh we're
expecting all we're expecting these
biases to roll out sometime in the mid
to late June timeframe there are
apparently a couple boards that already
have public betas the GAA X 370 gaming 5
from gigabyte and the crosshair 6 from
Asus Europe modernizes media rules keeps
TV relevant this is the same boring
weirdest tarleton apparently the revised
directive gives broadcasters more
flexibility as to when ads can be shown
the overall limit of 20% of broadcasting
time is maintained between 7:00 a.m.
and 11:00 p.m. but instead of the
current 12 minutes per hour broadcasters
can choose more freely when to show ads
through the day okay so that gives them
the ability to sell a lot more
advertising during primetime and then
kind of ease off it when most people
aren't listening kind of like what
you'll see them do on the radio where
they'll have like an hour of
uninterrupted ad free music when
nobody's freaking listening anyway yeah
yeah like really late at night Billy I'd
like to be like four hours or something
like during my morning commute on GSN
1040 is the only radio station that I
still know exists like ever like it's
like an 18 minute drive and I will get
like at least one ad for where to take
my Cummins Cummings turbo turbo diesel
yeah Cummings or come in Cummings uh all
that columns is it different all the car
people are coming for me Oh anyway um so
I can I know where to get my diesel
repaired I know where to uh come in okay
I know where to go for my my freight and
logistics I know where I could buy a
Chrysler and look like all this they get
like so many sponsor regions so the
reason why we're saying Cummings and
most people probably freaking the heck
out is that is a like trailer and engine
shop that's actually somewhat near us so
we've probably seen there it's a local
shop okay it come ins is this specific
yeah okay um so anyway what else are
they doing the convertible a blah blah
plop the new proposed rules are
platforms which organize and tag a large
quantity of videos will have to protect
minors from harmful content such as
pornography and violence and protect all
citizens from incitement to hatred so
there's basically kind of leveling the
playing field a little bit like you know
let's let's take let's say some popular
cancerous online personality that that
is driving viewers to a platform TV
doesn't even really have the option to
like like if everyone's kids are
attracted to this person who swears a
lot and spews a lot of a lot of hate and
garbage every but it's driving traffic
and driving revenue to the platform
basically what they're trying to do is
level the playing field a little bit
there
okay look you can't you can't market
that at that miners yeah okay well now
ensure that regulatory authorities are
truly independent from government and
industry to ensure that the audio-visual
media act is in the interest of the
viewers and they want to something
something something something yeah I
really don't know if that's going to
save TV but I wish them luck yeah oh
good wonderful just when I was enjoying
the Galaxy s8 and its iris scanner this
is from bleeping computer comm the SAP
excuse me the Samsung Galaxy s8 iris
scanner is apparently easily hackable
and fooled by a photo which is funny
because I remember specifically sitting
in a samsung briefing for the note 7
they see they promise all kinds of
things above the note 7 they promised it
would mix load well they didn't did they
never came up but they said that the
iris scanner wasn't going to be like
facial recognition and that it wouldn't
be easy to fool but apparently a photo
of a person's eye taken at medium
distance is more than enough to trick a
Samsung Galaxy s8 smartphone according
to researchers from the Chaos Computer
Group so the saying that they use depth
scanning to try to like make it more
advanced and that whole advancement was
bypassed by gluing a contact lens on top
of the image creating a round surface on
top and that successfully tricked
everything interesting so the and this
is because modern iris scanners and
facial recognition systems are
programmed to use image depths in order
to distinguish between photos and a
human or like other three-dimensional
object so I think there's a number of
different ways that you should break
that to be on lever trick and this is
great to get the best results with your
hack you are going to want to use a
Samsung printer
perfect so take photos using the cameras
knife shot mode as it captures iris
details better and then she got the best
results on the Samsung
their friendship thing is okay to be
fair that out of everything on this
article that seems a little
sensationalist because he might have had
like a Junko printer and then like the
really expensive Samsung printer that he
bought and been like uh-huh guess what
or he had just two different Samsung
printers it was like yeah my vultures
are great was off the only one I have
thanks Samsung for sponsoring this
article onion yeah not so much okay
we've got an iPhone rumor so why don't
we move on to something else
researchers engineer shape-shifting
noodles researchers from MIT engineer
noodles that can change shape so these
sheets of gelatin transform into 3d
shapes when dunked in water which could
save on food shipping costs Oh solving
the world's problem one air pocket at a
time right now I'm not easy to change
shape though well because people like
noodles in different shapes people like
I like bowties you know my family always
called them diapers oh hi that's think
about that next time you're eating a
would you do that especially if you've
gotten kind of like like a really chunky
sauce in it
I was great think about that but I need
it okay some like not minced enough
chunky diapers change diapers um yeah
with like a yellow curry yeah so that's
why if you have to bring curry into it
it looks the same going in is coming out
that was good that's good that's good as
awful as I was I thought okay at first I
thought this was like a feed the hungry
thing not just we're gonna save money on
shipping cost because that's a good idea
yeah you know the researchers created
flat disks that wrap around beads of
caviar similar to Ken cannoli cannoli I
don't know much about caviar so you know
as well as spaghetti that spontaneously
divides into smaller normal when dunked
in hot water like I could see
if if they get to get away with it
I could see Kraft buying this like
patenting the crap out of it and that
being like the only path to my kids
would eat we'd be like no it'll like
grow we want the purple ketchup and we
want that we want the magic noodles but
now the crap package instead of being
this big and that thick ah you like you
would just take like this brick of
noodles they would be like you know like
like the food synthesis machines on like
a futuristic shows right where you just
like have the little breakaway warden
and it's like blue ha ha yeah and I mean
knowing Kraft they'd find a way to find
something that tastes nothing like
cheese but it's somehow delicious anyway
and mix it in there they're all pre done
you just be like it's it's like it's
like a it's like a KD square yeah and
maybe if America is really nice and eats
up all their vegetables they'll get the
good version this time oh my goodness
okay this is interesting apparently even
if you were to pack macaroni perfectly
which would be that the be-all and
end-all of OCD you still end up with 67%
of the volume wasted I say I'm not even
supposed yeah that that makes sense yeah
so it would be drastically smaller than
before okay so do you remember how we
had talked about as like an offshoot
business potentially building like VR
like VR arcades or like local VR centers
yes as like kind of a hey LMG has some
some cash flow why don't we like invest
in a new business idea I'm actually glad
we didn't job because I max is
apparently opening up virtual reality
centers and I'm sure that Wow
is going to do it better than we would
it's also really expensive yeah it's
really expensive but IMAX is going to be
kind of like the premium option they
actually talked about this a fair bit at
the Acer event that I attended a few
weeks back and basically they're like
creating constant they've got all the
partnerships with the film industry so
they want to create custom content with
like triple-a IPS so people can go in
and have like
there's a quote here that says you walk
it of a movie all excited about having
seen John wick or the Avengers yeah and
you can walk right next door like within
the same building right next door not
like to the next building and continue
being immersed in that experience
because you can like continue the story
as that character or whatever this is
pretty sick so in the first four months
of 2017 the pilot Center that they have
down in LA registered more than 25,000
admissions with an average revenue of
$15,000 per week so they're planning
five u.s. centers and they talked about
at least back at the Acer event how they
could see this becoming like a worldwide
fricking thing so what we had talked
about was really a lot smaller it was
kind of later you'd go there like a
little place and there would just be
like you know machines set up and you
could really took some inspiration from
a few of the like interesting tech
places around the world videos that I've
made yeah
and it was going to be like a cool place
to hang out there was probably going to
be some food and like maybe a bar and
then in the back somewhere there'd be
like VR areas where people there'd be
like a TV setup for each station so your
friends could like kind of watch you
play and there would be enough setups
that you could all play against each
other with each other or whatever but we
decided not to not only because well we
had the foresight to kind of realize
that if it was super worth it someone
else would probably wreck us anyways
which sounds like it ended up being what
was going to happen and also that VRS
wasn't at all ready yet when we wanted
to do it um oh you know what Guilford
mall has a little VR thing it's like 35
bucks an hour you know Rhode Island when
I went in there were like three or four
people playing I just walked out so I
was like whoa yeah and I kind of popped
my head in but yeah I think that's
probably pretty much it for the show but
I do have kind of a bombshell to drop
for those of you who have made it this
far so it's uh it's I I wrote very much
to inform you guys this will be I mean I
want you guys to kind of to kind of hear
about it from us rather than just kind
of figure it out eventually but
- Mickey V Nikki V is moving on from
Linus Media Group this is not an April
Fool's prank do not adjust your
calendars basically he's actually taking
a position making biking videos which
actually makes a ton of sense for him
that's the other thing that he's always
been super passionate about but voted
for him yeah it's it's funny we've never
we've never really lost anyone who made
it past their probation and in two weeks
actually Chelsea left as some of you
probably noticed already and we hadn't
really kind of figured out how to talk
about that yet and Nick van Berkel will
be no more now he's still here for two
more weeks yeah and I had actually asked
him already if not next Friday because
I'll be in Taiwan but the Friday after
which will be his last day if you'd like
to come on the LAN show and kind of hang
out maybe I don't know chat with you
guys do some QA whatever whatever just
kind of chill one last time but that'll
be that'll be I'd yeah so I had an idea
off the stream but I feel like I should
pitch it now so I can get the support of
the Wang Cho on oh my god everyone's
freaking out yeah if it helps at all I
feel exactly the same way but it's it's
it's I think it's the right thing I
think everyone is freaking out to a
certain degree but yeah I agree with -
he's always been into bike stuff he's
always been into outdoor video
snowboarding videos bike videos or
whatever and that's all events passion
I'm really excited for him I want to see
the stuff he's gonna make I think it's I
don't think it's impossible that we'll
ever cross paths again yeah be clear
we're we're parting on I mean it's still
kind of you know it still kind of stings
but we're parting on good terms so I'm
kind of hoping some weird tech thing
will come out that is very well
displayed on a bike yeah and we'll just
be able to kind of work with him
there'll be an opportunity to collapse
all like you won't still be making
videos so he's he's not moving out of
the Vancouver area so you're not going
to be like in a completely other country
or anything like that
so it's uh it's it's it's what what is
it what is it it's sweet it's not it's
not good bye and see you later yeah
yeah yeah so I had an idea for like one
one kind of cool channel super fun video
that he could do before he goes okay
last tune-up a lasting up ol Artie ah
there might be too much I don't know
might be too much for me to handle I'm
already gonna think of them every time I
Drive that maybe like ah
Nicky V so those of you that don't know
which is probably not very many of you
but Linus is car the super Civic or the
Lambo as it's called was custom custom
modded painted designed inspired by the
one and only Nikki B yeah there it is
there it is my friends all the all the
modifications he even replaced by
windshield wipers because he was like
these are straight-up dangerous like
these are not wiping your windshield
with anymore painting the painting the
racing stripes
so epic so epic yeah we we created a lot
of memories together it's really funny
sometimes I forget Wow
look at it the same way or do you think
it's like kind of known now I know I was
about to say sometimes I forget how like
ridiculous the car I'm driving is and
then like I'll Drive past the school and
kids will start like cheering like why
don't I cheer all right
oh it's the watermelon car oh it's that
car again yeah so it is with it is with
a heavy heart that I that I make that
announcement got people asking what's
going to happen with Channel super fun
Channel super fun is actually kind of up
in the air for a number of reasons not
anything to do with like it's already
it's already been up in the air for a
while but we're really not sure what to
do with it like it's it's at the point
now where instead of being fun it's kind
of stressful to get them done so an
option could be to just like not have an
upload schedule for it yeah like to just
do it whenever another option that I've
proposed is still having it be a weekly
upload but just limiting the editing
time down to pretty much kind of cutting
together some fun thing that we did and
making making it more about us just kind
of going and doing something fun for a
bit and less about making a video that's
fun yeah so I'm I'm really just not sure
yeah I'm not really sure where we're
going to go with that
but that's that's where we're at a lot
of people are saying RGB the civic RGB
Pacific yeah that's illegal
