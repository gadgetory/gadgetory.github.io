unboxing I'm a Microsoft webcam so this
is a Microsoft LifeCam
HD 5000 it features sharp video with
autofocus as well as true color which
they explain a little bit better on the
back now this isn't the first HD webcam
from Microsoft but it is a new one so
the old one has kind of as far as I can
tell they have pretty similar specs but
the older one has more like a
barrel-shaped
webcam shape so it's like well it's
shaped like a barrel and then this one's
more like a little a little brick okay
so that's the biggest difference that I
can tell right off of that here we go
they have a little uh-oh you know what I
think the one I looked at before was the
LifeCam cinema but I'm not 100% sure so
it looks like that one does have some
benefits that this one doesn't such as a
glass limbs aluminum body and clear
frame technology whatever clear frame is
so this one is also slightly lower
resolution for the photos it's only four
megapixel and it has a flexible base
noise cancelling microphone sixteen by
nine widescreen autofocus and true color
technology so true color means that it
is trying to retain truer colors as far
as I can tell basically it's taking a
dark shot and it's brightening it up a
little bit or a bright shot and
darkening it a little bit okay 16 by 9
widescreen is awesome if you have two
people in the shot as Microsoft so
kindly points out for us and then one
what is this supposed to be
that's a cupcake oh they're showing the
focus right so it can focus on a cupcake
and then it'll it'll smartly decide what
is supposed to be in the focus of the
shot so let's get this thing opened up
and like I do with all of my camera
unboxings I will actually shoot my next
unboxing with the LifeCam
HD 5000 or maybe it's not an unboxing I
think I'm gonna do some other video but
I'll shoot it with this so you will
actually get a preview of what the video
quality looks like for this camera so
this box is like incredible look at this
it comes apart in 18 million different
pieces okay so why don't we first have a
look at the accessories or other things
that come with it here is the
instruction Quick Start Guide one disc
two
plug in 3 put it there or there and 4
move it around a bit aim it I'm guessing
is what they're trying to say next we
have a life cam 3.0 software CD or DVD
I can't tell it's probably a CD and then
after that we have a Microsoft product
guide which tells us all of the safety
and ergonomics considerations webcam
with magnetic and adhesive mounting and
you know basically they're covering
there but legally make sure that you
know everything you need to know about
the product ok so then you just slide
the webcam out this way and then look at
this box this box is incredible you know
what I should just do the focus of this
unboxing should be on the box not the
webcam look at this thing it has like
four different layers and it like folds
in this way and then out that way and it
has like a look oh there I finally
figured out how it comes apart so the
box is actually like this shape look at
that I wouldn't be able to put this back
together I'm not gonna be able to put
this back together anyway here's the
webcam so we'll just take the little
plastic clamshell apart here and slide
that you know I had a lot of trouble
with this on the last one it's a good
thing I've seen this before so you just
take the little clamshell pieces off
there and then we get down to the webcam
itself so you can see it's it swivels as
they pointed out on the on the box and
then it doesn't actually tilt up and
down but what you can do is you can
adjust this flexible base I really like
this mounting system because it means
that you can just kind of sit it like
this point it up at you or you can kind
of move it around a little bit or you
could put it like this if you felt like
it and then I would sort of point this
way or you could you could take oh no
then I'd be upside down okay don't do
that but it also has a little notch on
the front so that you can easily sit it
on top of almost any LCD monitor so it's
it's wide enough that you can take even
a wide LCD monitor like the camera man's
and just mount it up on the top of the
screen like that point it down it
yourself and it's quite secure up there
it's not gonna just randomly come down
so I think that pretty much covers
everything I wanted to say about the
LifeCam HD 5000
it's HD and also there's appears to be
like a video call button on the top and
there's the microphone hole thank you
