CES 2016 this year check them out from
the link below and build yourself a
beautiful website so I was interested to
see that the LEGO Group has a booth here
at pep comm at CES 2016 they're showing
off something called we do 2.0 it's a
very simple robotics and programming kit
for kids aged seven to ten years old the
kit is a hundred and fifty nine dollars
and comes with two hundred and eighty
pieces including a single medium motor a
programmable Bluetooth smart hub
controller which also houses the
batteries I think and a tilt and a
motion sensor you can connect two
sensors to the smart hub or you can
connect one motor and one sensor there's
also an educational pack of 24 kits plus
a curriculum for two thousand two
hundred and sixty dollars is that
worthwhile I have no idea
now the marketing material for this kit
seems a little over the top
it's talking about an innovative way for
students to model reality and conduct
investigations and how a kid can explore
rainforests and discover Mars but of
course that's really just the theme of
the various builds that they've given
instructions for there's a frog there's
a Mars rover a rescue helicopter an
earthquake machine that one's my
favorite and a few others what makes the
kit interesting is the ability to
visually program a simple robot using
desktop and tablet based software the
software also gives you choices between
guided exercises or more independent
problem-solving now again this kit is
aimed at seven to ten year olds or 2nd
to 4th graders so it's not nearly as
complex as the well-known Lego
Mindstorms robotics kits which are
designed for ages 10 and up and because
the kid is so simple and it's directed
at kids so young it's pretty tough for
me to objectively evaluate just how good
of an educational learning tool it might
be for example I was expecting to see
two motors included in this kit instead
of one but the LEGO Group probably has a
lot of good reasons for designing the
kit the way that they did and if you
want more motors and more complexity and
more of a challenge you can always just
get Mindstorms or power functions or
something like that over all the Lego we
do 2.0 kit looks pretty promising
and I'm hoping to do a full more
in-depth review of it on our channel in
the future thanks for checking out our
