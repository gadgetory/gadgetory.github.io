of our video on the razor siren the
comments were full of people asking why
we didn't review microphone X Y or Z or
other microphone that was their personal
favorite and the answer was that we
simply didn't have them but the good
news is that the solution to that
problem was simple go freak and get them
so in today's video we'll be checking
out two mics from Blue Microphones the
yeti blackout which is exactly like the
yeti but well you get the point and the
yeti pro a premium yeti with better
recording quality and XLR support oh and
for those of you asking which appears to
be literally everyone scrapyard wars 1b
is coming out Saturday night so get some
popcorn and plant your butt on the edge
of your seat because it's going to be a
wild ride first
this video though
save on select intel core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015
click now to learn more the physical
tour of these microphones is one of the
reasons I opted to do them both together
as a single video they look almost like
exactly the same thing with a different
paint job so we'll focus on the blackout
to start the stand base uses foam to
reduce unwanted noise caused by
vibrations from desk movements and
features a satisfyingly solid
professional feeling metal construction
with a cable management hole through the
bottom and a shape that cups the top of
the microphone if you rotated 180
degrees for travel the arms have plastic
wish they were rubber spacers in between
and thumb nuts that let you lock the
microphone in at the desired angle at
the bottom of the unit itself is a mini
B USB connector a standard threaded hole
for use with third-party microphone
mounts and a headphone jack that allows
a real-time audio monitoring something
that is a must-have for podcasters games
dreamers are really anyone who wants to
hear their own voice for the assurance
that nothing is wrong with the recording
but who can't stand the delay that comes
along with software solutions so pretty
much everyone who does those things
while we're down here the main physical
difference between the pro and the non
pro is that the pro has this 5 pin
socket down here that with the use of
the included XLR left and right adapter
can be used with external recording
equipment so pro users aren't changed to
a PC Mac or Linux computer for audio
capture on the front of the mic is a
headphone volume knob and power
indicator LED that doubles as a mute
button so it flashes when it's muted
then around the back is the gain knob
for mic pickup and the pattern switch
that allows for any of the four
different pickup patterns to be selected
so there's a try capsule array of
condenser modules inside the little mesh
cover dome at the top that enables that
feature so mode number one stereo I hit
the wrong dial there we go is for if you
want the listener to be able to isolate
the source of
jewelle sounds in a recording
omnidirectional is for conference calls
or if you have some other reason why
you'd want to compromise how nice the
recording sounds for the sake of having
a lot of background or ambient noise
cardioid the mode i'd expect most users
of a mic like this to use is for getting
up close and personal with your mic for
that deeply satisfying AM radio sound
for podcasts voiceovers or other vocal
recordings and finally bi-directional is
for if you had two sources on opposite
sides of the mic like in an interview or
something but you wanted to cut out some
background noise from around the sides I
mean I can think of a thousand better
audio setups for an interview than this
but I guess it's hard to argue with it
for the price and with the ease of use
it's no wonder folks are so fond of
their yetis the microphone is completely
driverless just plug it in with the
included cable select the appropriate
audio device in your control panel and
you are ready to rock unless you pick up
the pro actually blue does have a driver
for this one on their website but I
guess that's because it supports up to
192 kilohertz 24-bit recording something
that might be useful for artists who
want to get the best possible results
although blues QuickStart guide which
has a lot of excellent information in it
for both mics by the way seriously one
of the best manuals I've seen in all my
years of doing this has some great tips
about choosing the right sample rate for
the final destination of your recording
versus just choosing the highest one so
like for example you want a multiple of
44 kilohertz if your audio is destined
for CD but of course once again Linus
gets over four minutes into a microphone
video without actually doing any
frakking sound quality comparisons I
hate that guy you're right and I'm a
terrible person so here we go I'll begin
with each microphone in its ideal
configuration in cardioid mode right in
front of me with a dual layer pop filter
the razor siren will be my main point of
comparison because it specs as someone
on the internet mistakenly interpreted
to mean it's a rebrand are so similar to
the Yeti and it's price is in between
the two leaning a little closer to the
pro next up is the blue Getty blackout
compared to the siren I find from a
reasonable distance it gives my voice a
perhaps slightly less natural but more
pleasing radio light quality and does a
significantly better job of blocking out
background noise of computer fans in the
room and the sound of typing on a
keyboard behind it the yeti pro picks up
even less of the typing and less of the
low hum in the room although the
difference is less pronounced than what
we saw between the siren and the regular
yeti but as impressive as that is the
main thing that makes it stand apart
from the other microphones today is the
sound of my voice through it the best
way I can describe it is that it
delivers sort of the best of both of the
other mics in this roundup but then
again I guess it should since it is the
most expensive so for my next trick
starting with the siren I'll run through
each of the three microphones and a more
convenient off to the side of my monitor
recording location this is where I would
expect anyone who isn't concerned with
the most professional possible vocal
recordings to position his or her
microphone since it gets it out of the
way switching to the Yeti I hear a
difference in the sound of my voice
recording that makes it seem like even
though all the microphones are still set
to cardioid the siren handles the
distance a little better in that respect
at least that would be the case if it's
background hum wasn't so noticeable
compared to the lower-priced Yeti and
finally switching to the Yeti Pro we
once again see why this mic is so well
respected it doesn't sound like it's
sitting in the next room over and still
does a great job of managing background
noise this thing is definitely worth a
few bucks extra compared to the siren
and I guess that's pretty much the
conclusion of this video the siren from
the conclusion of our review on it is
still a very good microphone it's just a
very good microphone with competitors
that are also very good and priced quite
a bit lower and we've noticeably better
recording quality and XLR supported only
a slightly higher price point the Yeti
and especially the Yeti Pro deserve all
the love they get from their users both
come highly recommended at this point by
the way guys if you want to compare
these mics against every other mic I've
ever tested there's a sound
