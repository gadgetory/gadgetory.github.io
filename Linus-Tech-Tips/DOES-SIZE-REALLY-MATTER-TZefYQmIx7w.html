though water-cooling legend Cathar
addressed this once and for all over a
decade ago it is still a topic of debate
in pc and liquid cooling groups so we
are going to find out
private Internet access features fast
multi gigabit VPN tunnel gateways
worldwide so if you're looking for a VPN
learn more about PIAA in the link below
so my answer to this question for the
last six or seven years has been 3/8
inch ID so that's short for inner
diameter 5/8 inch OD so that's for outer
diameter and usually from primo chill in
whatever color your heart desires there
tubing's pretty good stuff and it's been
my belief that any bigger than this will
make no difference to your system
temperatures however I do have to
confess that I have never actually
grabbed some big old thick cold tubing
and tested this in a controlled
experiment so it is time to change that
first we're gonna need a few things
Intel Extreme Edition 59 60 X check
three different diameters of tubing
check a triple 120 millimeter radiator
check UK supremacy Evo CPU block check
fittings check and check check and the
optimal footwear for science extra check
pose oh right the last thing we need
this is a flow meter this will allow us
to measure the flow rate of our
different loops and a shout out to the
guys over at performance pcs for sending
this over to us on super short notice
now as much as I love to spend my day
building testing and tearing down
various water cooling loops with
different tubing sizes there is a reason
that I hired writers so I'm gonna let
Jake take care of that while I go do
very important CEOs duce you put Stoops
in there yeah no you put Stoops in there
oh sure it said stuff before okay sure
whatever
ha ha joke's on me I guess because I
still have to record this narration so
then to keep our testing relevant
the real world all of the loops were
built into an actual case the fractal
design define r5 so to establish a
baseline we're starting with a typical
configuration so we've got our pump
going out to our CPU over to our
radiator and then back to our pump which
has a reservoir built into it the whole
thing is running 3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD
clear tubing from primo chill
as for coolant we're just using plain
Jane water which is going to be replaced
for each one of our tests I mean I mean
not because we would expect that new
water would affect the results it's just
because recapturing and reusing it would
actually be very inconvenient that is
how you fill a water cooling loop so to
put a little bit of extra heat into our
loop this will help to separate the
performance between the different tubing
sizes we're going to set it up to 4
gigahertz with 1.15 volts it's not like
an impressive overclock for a 59 60 X
but it should be stable and really
that's all that we need for this kind of
an experiment all right so let's get out
of going stress FPU and bibbity Boppity
we will be back in a while we ran each
of our tests for a good chunk of time
start a 15 minute timer and then we
reset the statistics collecting them
over a three minute window to get
meaningful averages in between our 50%
and 100% pump speed tests we allowed a
grace period of 10 minutes with the fans
on full blast to cool our water back to
ambient
after the first set was done the process
was repeated with 12 millimeter inner
diameter tubing and then 13 millimeter
inner diameter okay so yeah okay
how our results then well they're a
little depressing they're all within
margin of error and I didn't even get to
use the flow meter because there's no
way to get any results from the RPM that
it reads no liters per gallon or liters
per gallon liters per so it's just an
RPM yeah it's just an RPM yeah
so why it's just no difference yeah it's
it's no difference what why are you
going over there hey stay away from that
what are you wait wait a minute wait
what hey I knew it you weren't supposed
to see that
it's the workshop alright so you had
your fun Jake so back in the early days
of water cooling enthusiasts would often
repurpose aquarium pumps which are
optimized for flow rate and not head
pressure
so using wider diameter tubing could
make a big difference but thanks to more
pressure optimized pumps like the d5 and
the DDC even if this might not seem
intuitive even dropping down to like a
ten millimeter diameter is a non-issue I
mean even quarter-inch which the most
basic all-in-one water coolers use
should not affect the performance of a
modern loop in any way other than the
Bend radius of the tubing so in most
cases it's far more important to
consider other things like the
restriction of your water blocks any
tight bends the inclusion of restrictive
fittings like quick connects but even in
of this worst-case scenario which we
actually built fairly recently the d5
didn't break a sweat so the final answer
then what tubing do you buy well it's
the good old same answer that we started
out with any good quality tubing like
primo chill or ek in ten millimeter
inner that would be 3/8 inch or 16
millimeter outer diameter that's 5/8
inch for our Yankee friends and the
thicker of the wall the kind of better
because it'll help with any kinking in
your bends if you don't want to use
angled fittings like we've done on some
of our builds private Internet access
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption which allows you to
dial in the exact level of privacy
protection that you need they've got
apps for Windows Mac OS Android iOS
Linux and Google Chrome with support for
other platforms coming soon and you can
connect
to five devices at the same time using
your account their apps include DNS leak
protection and ipv6 leak protection as
well as an Internet kill switch that
will block all traffic if the VPN
becomes disconnected unexpectedly so
check it out today at the link in the
video description and get P ia either
for yourself or as a gift so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
hit that like button now I get
subscribed or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also link down
there's our merch storage has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join to
get to get that out of here I liked it
it's pretty nice actually you know what
we should probably put it I should put
this in Luke's off how about like right
here like right there that's pretty cool
right
I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
