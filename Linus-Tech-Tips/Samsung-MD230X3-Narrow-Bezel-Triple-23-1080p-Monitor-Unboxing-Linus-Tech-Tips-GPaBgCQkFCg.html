very cool unboxing this is the Samsung
sync master ND - 3 0 x3 they should just
call it like the Goliath or something
because that would be a lot easier to
remember and it would also be a lot more
descriptive I mean look at the size of
the box this is a monitor it's so heavy
the only way to get it here into this
room was to take it on that cart and the
only way to get it up on the table is by
humiliating myself by trying to lift
something that's clearly way too heavy
for me there you go so what this is is
it is three monitors in one I'm gonna
let that sink in for a minute while I
try to figure out how to get this out of
the box this it actually has clamps on
the box you know don't make me give you
the clamps like those kinds of but I
have two more on the other side here so
I'm just removing those because there's
actually and I could tell this when I
lifted it up there's actually a box that
slides over top okay so that is all
packed with foam and there's some kind
of documentation here which will
probably need alright
so that's okay this is gonna be a long
unboxing just brace yourselves guys
because uh a bit of an adventure I've
never unboxed three monitors in one box
before so it's a challenge but I like an
unboxing challenge I've also never
encountered clamps on a box before so
here we are
what's this we got limited warranty
which is three years parts three years
labor
you can either carry it in or ship it in
they will not pick it up from you which
is pretty much standard we have an
assembly guide and it's like wow it's
actually pretty hardcore oh no it's okay
because it has like 16 different
languages so the English
is the first line but let's actually see
how how many steps there are so there's
at least five seven nine
oh no okay so this is only if if it's
two by three
Oh two by three okay hold on so we have
1 by 3 here we are so 1 by 3 pivot so
that oh no we're not doing that either
oh okay cool so you can put it that is
the way I would use it that's legit
but you can also do 1 by 3 non pivot so
there's 11 steps involved in that one so
you can put it together a few different
ways all right last but not least we
have a warranty statement thing again
okay and then we have a disk which has
their magic eye software magic magic
Brite magic tune and and then let's keep
going with the unboxing so here's a box
pretty substantial got some got some
heavy stuff in there so pull out the
knife again break some more seals cuz
that's what I do oh I missed nice Wow
so you know most monitors yeah they got
you know they got an included cable
right yeah it's got included power cord
this one comes with one two three
standard computer power cables alright
it comes with one two computer power
cable extension cords it comes with I'll
figure those out later it comes with at
least one DisplayPort cable it comes
okay it comes with one DisplayPort cable
to single-link DVI so that is standard
deviations
one USB cable another USB cable so that
is two USB cables
a what appears to be remote alright so
this is a remote for controlling
something about the monitors I saw this
mentioned on the Samsung site but I'm
definitely gonna have to show you guys
how this works outside of the unboxing
but it looks like there's no on-screen
display because you've got things like
brightness and contrast controls right
here on this little remote it connects
via USB so I'm not really sure where it
plugs into but we'll figure that okay
and then watch these look like they'll
just look like magnets I don't know if I
have anything metal okay try this on no
they're not magnets okay well we'll
figure out what they are later then
alright but we have a few of them we
have one two three four five six six of
them okay that's cooling down then we
have whatever these are these look like
some kind of a bracket don't do that
with them evidently
don't know what that is so these are
these are brackets that up you have
there we go so they go like this alright
how many of those do we have we have one
two three four we have four of those
okay and then we have lots of screws so
these are the a screws and we have B
screws alright that is the hardware all
note last but not least we oh we have
some cable management stuff which is
great because we have a lot of cables
alright so that's that's the accessories
you know what we'll actually just kind
of well throw all this back in here and
keep it out of the way while we have a
look at the monitor itself okay next we
have LCD panels the lower so we have
three panels first one is here so let's
go ahead and
from the pictures I've seen of these
they actually look more like like a
professional LCD panel then like a
monitor like based on me look at look at
the industrial design on the back like
these are just like hardcore so you've
got what appears to be visa compatible
that looks like what is it 100 by 100 on
the back maybe 75 by 75 can't tell
and then you've got four additional
mounting holes here you've also got like
sort of like random screws and stuff
you've got a lot more labelled screw
holes all over the back of the monitor
all right I also on the back of the
monitor we have some ventilation holes
here at the top that's where all the
electronics are inside and then at the
bottom you will find all of our input
options so here's one of that here
actually I don't want to put this down
directly on the table so I'm just going
to pick that back up okay Wow so here
are the interfaces at the bottom of the
monitor so we have VGA please don't use
that please please do not buy a $2,000
monitor setup and plug it in via VGA
please okay then we have DVI DisplayPort
so either of these are going to be
perfectly legitimate options and so the
reason they've included two DVI cables
and one DisplayPort cable is because as
you may or may not have guessed by now
this is really intended for use with
AMD's Eyefinity technology so that means
you can plug in two of the monitors by a
DVI and the third one will have to be
DisplayPort since they're DisplayPort
ready that's awesome it's perfect for
eye affinity next you've got USB so this
one says oh this is interesting so
you've got two USBs here one of them is
control out and the other one is control
in I'm going to go ahead and guess
that's something to do with that remote
control thing that we saw this is a
monitor selection button so we'll have
to figure out what that does do and next
we have a power input as well as a power
switch and this is good
because I called those extension cords
but because this has a power out that's
shaped like a power like a PC power cord
like a I guess what would that be female
like a
LP C power-chord you can actually just
daisy-chain one monitor over to the next
one in order to make things as tidy as
possible but we haven't even gotten to
the part of this thing that is so cool
check out how thin the bezel is on this
monitor so I don't remember the specs I
didn't even before I started but I did
assume that I would forget them and I
brought myself a handy dandy tape
measure in order to measure them for you
guys so the bottom bezel is let's see
that's half an inch so that's Wow
that's like just over a quarter of an
inch so whatever whatever that unit is I
think those are sixteenth so like 5/16
of an inch on the bottom on the top it
looks like just a little bit bigger yeah
so that looks like about six sixteenths
okay so hold on you know one two three
four or five that's five either way okay
you know what you guys can figure this
out you're really smart
I'm holding the tape measure up for you
you can always look it up on the Samsung
website now let's look at the side
bezels which are even thinner because
that's the most critical one because
that is where you're going to be able to
reduce the amount of bezel blocking your
images when you're running in AMD
eyefinity so when you put these next to
each other you're actually only gonna
have careful around another one since we
conveniently have three of these
monitors packaged together like this all
right so when you're running a knife in
any mode you're only gonna have well how
these are heavy to the metal casing the
overall yeah industrial design of them
is very uh it feels very beefy unlike
most consumer models that's it that's
all you have in terms of a bezel in
between your monitors so here the last
thing I want to do for the unboxing
because as I can clearly see from the 11
step assembly
process that ties in the user manual I'm
not going to be building this on camera
so the last thing I want to show you
guys is the stand it comes with look at
this thing is that a monitor stand or
what so here put that there want to have
a look at the overall finish of it
because this is the kind of thing that
when you buy a monitor that's 2 grand
essentially you're not buying a monitor
you're buying like a piece of furniture
basically this has to sit on your desk
it has to look absolutely gorgeous while
providing the functionality that you
paid for it
they put a gorgeous brushed finish on
the stand all right there's a little bit
of dust on it but don't let that don't
let that take away from the experience
can you see that in the camera like the
the brushed lines here try and get some
different angles so you can see that
it's just wonderful looks really really
nice and I just want to have a quick
look here at what else we have in terms
of adjustments it looks like like it
almost looks height adjustable but the
pressure that I'm putting on it doesn't
seem to be doing anything but I guess
we'll figure that out later okay
so I'll just so you guys can have a
little quick look at the bottom it's got
a bunch of rubber feet on it so no
matter how hard you try it should be
fairly difficult to knock this monitor
over you can see the base is quite wide
even when you compare it to the size of
the apparatus that will be connected to
it okay so it's about the width and
change of one of the single monitors so
it's going to come out to about here
look any meat it's going to come up to
about here and then up to about right
here like about my arms fan tip to tip
is how wide this is going to
so thank you for checking out actually
hold on up here let me check the box
really quick and we'll go over the specs
somewhat so Samsung is advertising a one
hundred fifty thousand to one dynamic
contrast ratio
okay these are 23 inch I don't think I
mentioned the resolution these are 1080p
monitors each so that means that they
run at what is it 57 60 I think by 1080
or if you're running them in portrait
mode they're going to be whatever three
times 1080 is by 1920 okay what else do
we have to say about these guys before
we wrap this up I think that is pretty
much it I didn't want to find out if it
had a height-adjustable stent but tell
you what if you guys can find out for me
and post it in the comments of yes it's
height adjustable completely higher
adjustable well not completely I mean
100 100 millimetres so 10 centimeters
height adjustable and then also you can
those hinges that we unboxed before in
the accessory package these guys right
here so what these are for
is they actually attach to at each hinge
they attach to the back of the monitors
and they allow you to adjust up to a
30-degree angle
the outer monitors for your for your
peripheral vision so you're looking more
straight at them instead of having it as
like one big long flat panel so thank
you for checking out my unboxing don't
