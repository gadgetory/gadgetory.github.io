6 5 5 K this is basically exactly like
this one except for 220 and also 2 so 2
&amp;amp; 2
actually they're completely different
this is a dual-core processor this is a
quad core processor this one includes a
graphics core on the chip this one does
not so if you're running an age 55
motherboard and you want to use the
onboard video you will need a Core i5
dual core or a core i3 but that's not
really the topic today the topic today
is this unlocked
both of these CPUs feature unlocked
multipliers which means easy
overclocking you can actually check out
my NCI XCOM full tech tips episode on
overclocking the i7 875 K and the same
rules do apply to the i5 6 v 5 K now
this includes all of Intel's
key technologies for the i-5 so that's
their LGA 1156 processors including
turbo boost hyper threading smart cache
as well as support for dual channel ddr3
memory one thing that it doesn't include
that I don't miss is the pathetic
included heatsink that Intel ships with
all of their processors Intel is still
offering a full three-year retail chip
warranty on this despite the fact that
they do not require you in fact require
you not to use a provided Intel thermal
solution right there says thermal
solution required so that's pretty cool
because this thermal solution is not
good for overclocking and this chip is
designed from the ground up for
overclocking unlocked means you can
adjust the CPU multiplier or the CPU
speed with just the push of a button
that's all you have to do you don't have
to worry about any memory ratios any
base clock adjustments nothing like that
you just turn up the multiplier and it
goes faster that simple included is a in
installation book including an Intel
Inside logo label on the back as well as
the terms of your three-year limited
warranty and then here you're going to
find something that basically looks like
every other LGA 1156 chip on the planet
it is 3.2 gigahertz and then it'll turbo
up to actually I don't even know I'm
terribly sorry please leave a comment
under the video so that people will know
how much it turbos up to but their dual
cores turbo up pretty good is probably
like four speed bins
it doesn't really matter anyway because
it can turbo up to whatever you want and
if you check out my tech tips video
where I show how to do that then you
will also know how to make the turbo
boost actually turbo up to whatever it
is that you specify very cool features
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the I five six five five
