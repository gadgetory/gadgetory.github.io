handy tech the show where we find handy
stuff that's tech and show it to you
it's also one of the only series that we
have managed to stick with over the
years anyway we've got a lot of great
stuff in our hands today to fuel your
childhood gaming nostalgia that is
unless you're currently a child in which
case you probably won't really get most
of this stuff speaking of getting it get
tunnel bear tunnel bear is the really
simple privacy app so you can enjoy a
more open Internet to try total bear for
free go to tell bear comm /l TT will
have that linked below
first up is the SN 30 from 8bit doe a
remarkably accurate replica of one of
Nintendo's most beloved controllers only
made like six controllers so it's not
that hard but anyway it even has the
right mix of convex and concave buttons
it's available in nests or Famicom color
schemes and it was designed for use with
the recent Ness classic and super Ness
classic consoles since for some reason
Nintendo decided that in spite of the
much greater size of modern TVs they
would endow those systems with cables
that are much shorter than the originals
so now then you can sit comfortably on
the couch because not only is the SM 30
a 2.4 gigahertz wireless controller it
also lets you reset the console remotely
by holding down and select the
controllers can last for up to 25 hours
off of just an hour of charging over USB
micro-b and they are reasonably priced
at 25 bucks
now unfortunately the dongle complete
with nest style grill marks uses
Nintendo's proprietary connector so
while you can use the SN 30 as a wired
controller for your PC Mac or Android
device by plugging in a USB cable it
doesn't have the broad functionality of
the SN 30 pro turning everything good
about the SN 30 up to 11 it's got modern
Nintendo features like Rumble feedback
and motion control plus this nifty
button for taking screenshots on the
switch it also has thumb sticks a home
button and two sets of L and our
shoulder buttons making it a fully
functional Xbox one controller that can
connect to anything with a Bluetooth
signal the feel is a little less
authentic it's heavier they had to shift
the buttons up to make room for the
joysticks and like the regular one it is
thicker than an original controller not
to mention that it's twice the price at
49
it could be much more useful especially
with the $8 smart phone clip accessory
which has a surprisingly good job of
hanging on to even large phones though
the way
is slightly imbalanced all right then so
you like the idea of tactile gaming on
the go but you want something smaller
how about the our do boy a credit card
sized 8-bit game platform that lets you
not only play games but also make and
share them our D boy comes with only a
single classic 8-bit game but it can be
reprogrammed from a huge library of free
open source and editable games online
the unit itself is super light but still
feels durable with a metal back
polycarbonate front and subjectively
pretty fantastic buttons and it's got a
toggle switch to turn it on a 1.3 inch
black and white passive matrix OLED
screen and 2 piezo speakers to blare
your favorite chip tunes for up to 8
hours on a single charge and because
it's based on Arduino Leonardo
it can actually be recognized as an
input device like a synth keyboard or
even a remote for your quadcopter not
bad for 49 bucks but if you're not
interested in the user programming
crowdsource EE thing you can also get an
alternate version of the our D boy the
tetris micro card this one has an
additional toggle for sound a vertically
oriented screen and only one game an
officially licensed version of tetris
complete with peace preview wall kick
and soft landings there are 15
difficulty levels that should be enough
for most people especially since you
cannot pause the game and it's a little
bit dear at $54 but it's fun little
retro toys go it is pretty awesome great
gift idea now to mash all of the themes
we've touched on so far into one the
nest PI case is a tiny Nintendo themed
enclosure for your Raspberry Pi B+ two
or three it has slots for microSD
expansion USB power in HDMI out and
audio out then it's got its own handy
daughterboard to handle pass-through
Ethernet and four USB to ports as well
as power and reset buttons and a cute
little red LED and this is cool
they include a small fan mount so you
can utilize the original slot and grill
for cooling and there's even a
mysterious little compartment that you
may or may not remember on the original
mess that the net spy uses to hold extra
SD cards this thing is actually a great
value even if you're not into the pie
scene at 28 bucks you could easily pay
more for just a Nintendo themed desk
ornament and I'm not even mad that it's
not as white as the one on the website
because the yellowing here makes it look
really realistic leading us to finally
hmm now we're gonna tie this into the
female god you could use it to lock up
all this gaming stuff so that your
roommates don't touch it with their
greasy Dorito hands trick method anyway
the tap lock is a smart padlock that you
unlock with your fingerprint just press
your finger against the capacitive
sensor and the lock opens in just 0.8
seconds which is key for a lock that you
open and close all the time like your
gym locker or your new year's resolution
forbidden snack cupboard priced at 85
bucks the tap lock can hold up to five
hundred fingerprints making it easy to
share with your whole family and the
battery can last for up to a year or
3500 unlocks before it needs to be
topped up with the magnetic cable you
can grant and revoke access to other
people using the companion app and you
can also use it to check on the locks
battery life and open it without your
finger by connecting over bluetooth as
for how strong it is as a plain old lock
I mean like anything with the right
tools you could obviously break it but
it's pretty beefy so at 300 grams the
electroplated body is made of Zanic 3
while the anti shim and the anti pry
shackle is 7 millimeters of reinforced
stainless steel as for whether it can
withstand the weather though that's a
bit of a mixed bag so tap lock is ip66
rated so any amount of rain should be
fine as long as it doesn't get submerged
but when it comes to temperature it's
only rated for between negative 10 and
60 degrees Celsius so not ideal if your
shed is in northern Canada alright then
