backup plus portable drive it is a
portable hard drive which means it uses
a notebook drive as opposed to a desktop
drive in an enclosure all right two and
a half inch not three and a half inch
easy portable backup for your digital
life for PC or Mac now they do have a
specific max Q but the only real
difference seems to be included cables
as well as the formatting of the drive
out of the box you can actually reformat
it to whatever you need
whichever one you buy so don't stress
too much about whether you bought the PC
or the Mac Edition for your grandson or
granddaughter and you're not sure what
kind of a little computer they actually
have don't stress out about that just go
ahead get the external hard drive and
they can figure out the rest on their
own for a pretty cool reason and I'll
get into that later
aha right there upgradeable interface
even if you buy them totally the wrong
thing with totally the wrong interface
they don't actually have to buy a whole
new drive to replace it they can just
get a new interface cable plug it in and
they're off to the races
social media backup yes what makes this
a backup plus the fact that it already
with the current Seagate software is
capable not only of backing up things
that are on your computer but also
saving photos from Facebook to your
drive so a lot of the time people these
days are walking around with their
smartphones and they're like taking
pictures of stuff this is a simulation
taking pictures of stuff and they're
like oh yeah I'm gonna upload these to
Facebook and so people can like them and
so what happens a lot of the time is
those pictures if you don't religiously
backup your phone might never even end
up on a computer so how do you back them
up
what if Facebook at some point goes IPO
and their stock tanks and then they
disappear umm maybe they'll take all
your pictures with them just kidding
that's probably not gonna happen but if
it does you can backup all your Facebook
photos to this drive with an easy
interface so that is pretty handy easily
backup all of your other stuff locally
and the cloud helps you protect all of
that good stuff and flexible for all
your needs not or a PC I think we've
hooked on that enough there's also very
slim so let's go ahead and open it up
you got your limited warranty
who doesn't warranty on this guy two
years there you do your limited warranty
I wonder what unlimited warranty would
be someone who knows what an unlimited
warranty would be should like post under
the comments and tell us about an
unlimited warranty Oh slick is actually
pointing at something that hasn't
unlimited warranty snap-on sorry about
that guys
battery our brothers battery yeah memory
card was full so snap-on tools have an
unlimited warranty I could literally
take this thing and like break it over
the side of the table and take it to
them and they would give me a new one
so all right what do we got in terms of
cables included we have a USB 3 cable
excellent what else we got going on here
well we have an external drive so this
is a 500 gig drive however it is
available in a variety of capacities and
we're gonna go ahead and remove the
plastic wrap all right so we got like a
matte finish going on on the bottom we
got like a shiny finish going on on the
side we got a brushed finish going on on
the top which looks just deadly it's
awesome can you see how awesome it looks
this look says no there we go that is
what it looks like I'm looking at the
camera over his shoulder okay this is
what I mean about easy upgrade
interfaces so this is just a SATA
interface back here very cool so I am
personally a huge fan of their go flex I
don't know if thinking even calling it
that on this Drive nothing through even
calling it that but this is what it was
originally called was go flex and go
flex was just swappable modular
interfaces so you go ahead the chipset
actually resides in here so you go ahead
and just click that in there now 2 USB 3
Drive because you've got a USB 3 2 SATA
chipset in there there you go take this
off throw something else on there maybe
you got eSATA maybe you got firewire it
doesn't matter just clip that on and
you're good to go so that is my unboxing
of the backup plus slim drive from
Seagate actually here let's check out
how slim it is so I have a like a third
party external hard drive going on over
here and I thought this one was pretty
slim and pretty sleek so uh this is all
in one let's go ahead and have a look so
those are about the
very cool so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look and don't
