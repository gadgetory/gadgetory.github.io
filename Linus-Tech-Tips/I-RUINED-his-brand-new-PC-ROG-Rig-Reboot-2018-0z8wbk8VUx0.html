right now ah you should be coming over
here yes because we are about to build
your new dream gaming machine sponsored
by ASUS ROG Wow
that's it this gonna be one of those
kind of videos laughs apparently yeah
so Nick my understanding is that you
went full snowflake on the the rig
configuration here
I will admit yeah can you explain some
of your choices so I see some
significant differences here you've got
team group 480 gig SSD with a massive
one terabyte additional SSD because like
you know your your mass storage can't
even that can't be on magnetic
apparently for you you've gone Rison I
have why did you decide to go Rison
because I'm not just gonna playing games
all the time what else will you be doing
I mean what you do on your personal time
is not I've been streaming but kind of
hard to do on my laptop because if you
open anything other than OBS it just
crashes right so you could stream a
blank desktop yes interesting so if you
ever built a machine before no how do we
keep finding you people where you're
like super into tech but then you've
like never built a computer I have no
idea
have you ever owned a desktop I owned a
I owned a Mac Mini from 2006 back or
like 2008 or something around there that
doesn't count okay well it was a desktop
okay so here's your motherboard yeah
there it is that the new one yep nice
the latest motherboard go ahead and is
this some other one yes this is the
motherboard I didn't know for sure ah
this guy sure I like this Nick guy can
you open the box though that's the
question oh it's just a baby you know oh
my gosh little over the top for a
motherboard well this is like
top-of-the-line shiz yeah you gotta go
for it I mean not quite they do have
thread Ripper which is more
top-of-the-line but this is like as top
of the line is AHA look at this look at
this motherboard picking up at least got
going on here edge of the PCV and like
heatsinks I don't know ads and stuff
it's good you know what it were that was
an accident wasn't it
stickers of course most important part
I'll apply these for you okay I'm gonna
do a really good job all of them
mounting hardware and these are for
chumps
jump yep chumps those are for people who
don't know what the wires are yeah
oh the chumps are that's me sorry but
I'm here to help I need to leave
woah yeah yeah actually don't do that
okay okay my dad were to open this nice
fallout yes so what I'd like you to do
is put that right look told you I've
never built a peaceful I'm an expert
when it comes to dropping things and the
thing that you learn from dropping a lot
of stuff is how to not drop things and
then you continue to draw the hard way
the hard way the hard way I keep finding
new ways oh this there's a triangle
right yeah but what about that triangle
there's no triangle there am I gonna get
bamboozled twice it should require no
force they do it no but a little bit of
force he lied to me this is all the easy
stuff though yeah this is the stuff I
have actually done once before you lied
no I haven't built the CETA PC I've put
in a CPU and I put in RAM and that was
not the RAM slot that's there I'm sorry
good okay you made it you're gonna try
to trick me there which no no I wasn't I
wasn't but you seem that me more it's
like trust no one not even yourself
that's me right there young kids today
they have different means than in my
generation see yeah for me it's like I
walk into room I'm like how are you
gentlemen cuz they're like you know what
are you talking about that's not English
there nope oh we almost got it yes they
do it yeah okay you got it
now hold on yeah that's again we go it
is customary to line up to line it up
carefully use two hands two games and
then this side doesn't have a thing
oh yeah that's so you generally put that
one in first gotcha and then the other
one snaps into place
Wow so how did you swing 32 gigs of ram
in this thing I don't know it's funny
cuz I'm making him feel special but the
other guy got all solid-state storage
and 32 gigs of ram too so yeah it looks
good to me
the Linus media school of life has
taught me well taught you that by making
videos about things you can get handed
that's a pretty good life that's a good
life lesson if I've ever seen one more
important to be popular than smile how
old are you you you and university yet I
or college or turned 18 I mean 19 two
days ago okay so you graduated last year
I graduated in the spring yes yeah okay
so I this is my first year of university
cool how's that going for you
oh it's good I think I don't know better
than it will when you have this to
distract you uh okay so I'm an
undeclared major at my university right
now and if I had to pick one today I
would do computer science or software
engineering so yeah you came ramming
kind of code on us you can co-op time
yeah that's what I've been doing yeah a
literally six-year-old laptop yes I know
I've watched your video no way okay
what's next
um I think oh it's the mouse man it's
gotta be alright I think I mean I'm
gonna set it up right here right there's
perfect okay you're gonna want to hold
on to that panel make sure that doesn't
fall fall there yep there we go it's
glass whoa yeah
tempered glass Wow here's 20 18 indeed
thank you
that case did you pick this know what I
think you can go I think it's either you
mount the motherboard or you can put the
power supply in I think go with the
motherboard
yep you put it is it going this way yeah
it does cuz this thing goes out there
shake I just go for it
I think it's just I don't know if I'm
lining it up exactly but I think it just
goes like that I guess so I found one of
the screws holy things done okay so
you're an upside down I'm upside down I
even mentioned that before I put it in
and I put it in back look it's nothing
personal it just makes me feel like a
big man you know I just you know I have
to let other people make mistakes so I
can feel like a big shot
what's better than that
I'll doing it well is better yeah I
didn't do it very good
I was like yeah yeah enjoy cuz in your
butt pocket you betcha
houston we have a problem come on get in
there it's it's been one of those days
you know where you don't want to wake up
everything is everybody sucks where are
you going with that really oh man
trying to reference something again you
don't really know why but you want to
justify Rifton someone's head off forget
it
holy crap you're 18 19 19 chesternut
you're 19 which means that when that
song came out I was just born parents
probably consummated to that song yeah
they did it's the young and restless
still around probably like like you've
you've heard of it right yeah I've heard
of that today are you proud of me now
no Lefty no Green Day's yeah how about
Green Day
don't be opposed it yeah you're right I
don't know what Green Day is I don't
I've never heard of it I was just trying
to before I met Linus I thought of
course he's putting on a persona for the
videos cuz he has to sad sometimes but
then you meet him and you're like
there's no way he's just acting like
that you're gonna go that way I'm gonna
go that way go that way I am okay I mean
I'm not judging you our house flies in
yes now what
cables there they are with cable on the
front yeah that would be a good guess
yeah how do you open this it's very
crushed is that like two slang from the
kids now yeah what does that mean cool
it's totally rad but could him even just
trying I'm trying when slang it's
pathetic no it's not it's not that's
that's slang we use us kids the
eagerness you said we need one of these
did I so like start it out and I was
feeling good about things because we did
the CPU and the easy stuff and then we
shot into like where does everything
plug in and line it's just like looked
at me and gave me that look like you
don't know what you're doing and I'm
like yeah help me right wrong wrong
yeah do you like that wrong this I think
we need this one looks like a good one
right yes I'm 1 for 3 I'm still failing
but when getting up there you're
actually 2 for 4 right 2 for 4
that's just under passing I think 50% is
actually a pass now where I come from
what's left and could roast you he put
them out he put the motherboard and I
put it in about his building were you
gonna go after like his shoes yeah I go
after my my looks I mean this is weird I
think his right shoes in a double knot
in his left shoes in a regular knot know
what's in a double knot was just like
it's just falling apart it's just a
crappy double knot it is yeah I'm not
gonna lie
look at this ready no
that's how we do it are you gonna pick
another cable at some port here you know
what wrong right yes the same thing but
one's longer longer is better right -
that's right I'm just laughing because
you were roasting my shoes and you're
wearing white socks and sandals these
are crappy socks I don't recommend them
I had no idea what was going on most the
time what that strap did you just do
what I messed up quite a bit
Wow it's a good thing I was here you
would have just tried a mother voice
that would have been that would have
been like full user error no warranty
nothing but we got there and it was
really fun Oh beautiful
isn't it though that is a work of art -
you had to drop something otherwise it's
not a Linus tech tips yeah this is I I
was I was all like yeah ROG they went
like full out on this all solid states
words for you guys they just knew we
gave you anything that could be broken
by dropping it yep boom yeah good
there's no mounting thingy there no
there isn't so just leave that there
oh yeah you're missing school I am good
deal am i good boy oh yeah I don't know
which way it goes I'm gonna assume this
way nope nope nope nope nope nope
yes yes yes yes yes
in his defense okay there's not a lot I
can say the defendant but like it kind
of looks like it goes on like that but
what would happen you wouldn't be able
to slide this into here or screw this
into oh no way oh they're here what you
are going to be the first to own the
Linus tech tips cable ties yes we are
gonna cable manage your system yes with
LTT edition cable types let's do it
they're just like regular cable ties
except they're LTP except we put this
logo on it that's a logo just ever like
Comic Sans LTG you know what I mean I
just roasted your company just Lloyd
it's just Lloyd radiator yes all my
washer clean up your act
I'm sorry get it ha ha what do we do
next is that all the cables that we have
so far there's only two left I know
there's those two it has to be the
graphics card yes we can plug the
graphics credit no ok that's just on the
floor that's ok it's true to the theme
of the bill the graphics card is not the
most important part of a gaming machine
especially not when it's like the ball
inist
graphics card oh no of course not you
know what this is right
yeah this is top shelf man yeah no they
just came out right 2080 TI this is a
two and a half slot cooler this is the
overclocked edition so it'll run a
little bit faster yeah it's got RGB 20%
increase right there right performance I
don't know this is sponsored by a sue so
I got to be careful about performance
claims I think so not actual don't pull
it into
hey Wow alright open this baby up let's
do it let me use my
nails to like try to cut this tape and
if I fail and it'll just slice into the
skin under your nail and take weeks to
heal
yeah the sacred tablet this is what yeah
the ancient manuscripts foretold of its
arrival you open it up and you're like
whoa nice oh my gosh this thing is a
little bigger than I expected
oh yeah that's really big and don't that
that's not what she said
but he so like I was telling a jono
before that the have like the only card
I'd ever really handled their touch
before was a GT 1030 this is what true
power feels like this thing is just like
all cooler and it's great it's wonderful
I love it
so because you have so much like raw
surface area there these fans like don't
even need to spin up barely a lot of the
time yeah so you're you're gonna hear it
but less than you'd probably think okay
yeah yeah power okay
this is Graham and Colleen gaming power
right here hold on let me brace the case
for you a little bit here do you want me
to go oh wow the best rip Oh
come on click yes cool and what's nice
about running them over the top like
this is they actually give it a little
bit of SAG support yeah do you wanna do
you want to see it turn on sure yeah you
don't want to see that I had don't you
write such a hater we're talking double
triple even quadruple numbers here sorry
this is a little over you good there's a
lip here you want me to say you want me
to give my raw opinions hire me to
sponsor your products with these cable
ties you two can cable manage quite
adequately sorry Louie see if we got
this all tightened down enough pretty
good a little bit of little bit of bulge
there but hey never hurt anyone that's
right that bulge in your computer oh
it's giant penis in your computer yeah
well you ever heard of EP let's try and
shoot down at it so we can't see those
top cables they didn't well he hands
right up thanks David terrific work
David okay yes so this is the part where
we like power it on for the first time
so we got to get the keyboard mouse
mouse Pat's do this thing okay I feel
like it I feel like a young child again
at Christmas when you're that young
child well are you legally an adult here
yeah 19 yeah okay you can't drink yet
though I don't think at 19 yeah so I
don't know if you know this but all your
peripherals they are all RGB and you can
actually synchronize them not just
between themselves but also with the
internals of your system aside from the
RGB which I know is the main feature
it's got Cherry MX switches basically
robust build quality media keys all that
good stuff nice high performance Mouse
oh yes oh yes the monitor is the
centrepiece of the peripheral upgrade
though so you got a 2560 by 6 what
you're upgrading from 720 you know I've
gotten used to it but I know it's bad so
you are getting about 4x the resolution
2560 by 1440 144 Hertz native 165 with
overclocking g-sync super low response
times let's go ahead and find out if the
system works you ready there you go whoa
look at that you haven't even seen the
RAM yet no oh that's gonna add at least
500 FPS the cooler has a screen on the
cooler which is I've never seen it
before and I was like that's really cool
we could also put water water ain't
water in never lose water in you know
what let's stick with frequency
we have your side panel which I actually
haven't seen yet I haven't seen this
either I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
fred durst and you want to see how it
runs of course what's your game my man
monster hunter world okay that we don't
have that you know what we're gonna
we're gonna buy it right now not for you
all right so you got five minutes to
wait which is actually perfect because
it gives us enough time to install an
RGB strip I don't know if we have enough
width we're gonna have to do some jank
stuff here slim this down a bit
don't take the front panel off don't
maintain the PC yeah don't forget
everything I said about cleaning the air
filter
nothing nothing don't make me take this
front panel off please you get to play
some Monster Hunter world while I play
decorate the case with stickers okay I'm
ready
oh no we suggested that these two
stickers go right here and right there
oh yeah that's a great suggestion
I see Otis
have you ever gained on like a high-end
rig like this know I was telling John oh
that I have never even experienced like
SSD speed like I've had hard disks I've
never had an SSD so this is very quick
well I don't know what's going on right
now I think it's just you don't you have
a headset you're right Oh
- Ollie that's you will you actually
play with the character I make you make
a good one I know this is kind of weird
but like the coolest box was that
headset whoa this box is that the
coolest box out of any of this cuz it
like opened up from like the middle like
he didn't pick one side wow this is some
very deep you've got to make a
customization you're gonna be like yeah
there we go max age max wrinkles oh yes
oh cool would you mess with this guy who
laughs crap oh look at these angry brows
oh now that might be a little too
ferocious although I'm gonna dial back
the ferocious a touch here what are
these outfits we're trying to make a
badass here yeah and you did look what
you made a mess what character limit Oh
thirsty mcdr face does that name okay no
no this is not okay nothing about this
image is okay oh you got to be kidding
me I need to make a cat and I'll have to
okay your cat's done
yeah I'm naming him after my dead cat
okay start thinking with this character
go for it ah oh there's your dead
do the honors okay I don't know what's
happening but fred durst can climb any
thoughts on how it runs it runs because
i'm my old computer it wouldn't that is
some well that's something
first tell me Toby where you've been
training dude holy crap
what's going on here I was like I was
like there is no way something is not on
my back right now but I'm just gonna let
it happen Republic of gamers how's it
looking it's I mean can you tell the
difference
are you kidding me of course I'm really
bad but you know and these bots are
really easy and not really doing
anything but it makes me look like I'm
good kind of you can adjust the most
sensitive do you know so it just has a
button right here alright just click
that whoa oh yes it's beautiful I'm not
good at the game like I said they're all
right there
what didn't stand a chance but like whoa
this is like I just like moving around
