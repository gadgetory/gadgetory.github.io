progress video so I've torn out most of
the internal hardware components
motherboards out
I haven't drained my loop yet so what
I'm going to do is I got my bucket here
so I'll be using this bucket in order to
drain it and then I'll just blow on the
end of the tubing to clear out the rest
of it until there's enough out that I
cannot just start disconnecting tubing
and pulling out the components and
draining them one at a time you can see
my temperature probe for my air fans
which are these ones and these ones and
then I've got a separate temperature
probe down here for my water fans which
controls these ones and these ones the
ones on the front radiator I've got a
better picture in my mind of what I want
to do for this particular build I think
I want to clean up the tube make our the
tubing the tubing's fine I want to clean
up the wiring a little bit so here on
the back especially it's a total mess
and there's a lot of sort of extra
there's any way that I can reduce the
overall amount of clutter a little bit
that would be great especially down in
the bottom so that's one of the things
I'm going to be trying to do I also
desperately I mean I had to do this
anyway just to clean out my water loop
check out this blog it's not disgusting
or what you and I'm going to try and get
you guys an angle of it here but do you
see this here I don't know how to get it
to to focus but there's text there's
text on the block's oh shoot this is
really hard to to show with it
reflecting like that but it's on the
other side there we go I think we got it
now it's on the other side of the plexi
so it's not on the side that I'm
touching it's on the other side and
there's text that goes like this and
then there's a like a black line that
runs from here all the way across to
here there's a WW something the most
bizarre thing I've ever seen so um so
that was that was kind of weird Oh what
else we got so yeah there's my old
motherboard raid card that's one of the
other things I have to figure out over
the course of this project this fan is
really loud but it needs to be on there
in order to cool the battery backup unit
so I'm either going to pull the battery
backup unit off of it or I'm going to
figure out a better way to cool it that
doesn't involve this a loud obnoxious
little tiny fan I made most of the noise
in my system so it's got to go the
advantage of the battery backup unit is
that if my raid array fails in the
middle of a write operation or while
something is still in the cache of the
of the raid card and not yet on my
drives it's like partially in both
places it can cause the data to be
corrupted so the battery backup will
flush the cache to remember flushes it
somewhere whatever or from Ram to
something I don't know anyway it
prevents corruption and but what
happened was it was overheating so I had
to put a fan on it and then it's loud so
that's annoying
so yeah reservoirs dirty these are
really hard to clean I love the MT res
micro but I really wish it was easier to
clean so that's one of the things I'll
be doing I've pulled off half of my SSDs
so far so got a pull off the other half
of them still going to be sticking with
the same SSD configuration I mean when
you have 8 SSDs it doesn't matter if
there's data - or SATA 3 you're you're
going to be limited by other things
other than the interface to each
individual Drive so um yeah I got to
clean up wiring to the key balancer a
little bit as well as a lot of extra
there so I'll be cutting off some wires
and then we re tying them in resawing
them in order to clean things up if I if
I have the gumption I also want to see
these the gray on the insides of these I
wouldn't mind spray-painting those black
just so that it's a little bit cleaner
looking at the front if you get this
angle it looks good but then if you get
this L'Engle you see the grey so I'd
like to like to get that fixed up and
I'll think about painting the optical
drive just because that's kind of ugly I
think that's pretty much it for now
so until there are more updates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
