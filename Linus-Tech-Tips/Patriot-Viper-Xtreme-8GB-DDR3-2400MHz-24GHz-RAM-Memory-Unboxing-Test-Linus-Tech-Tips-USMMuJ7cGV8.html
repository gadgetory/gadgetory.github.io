division 2 viper extreme ddr3 gaming
memory with unrivaled performance hold
on take the package off this Slick's all
like shiny then the lights will reflect
so basically this is an 8 gig memory kit
that runs at 2.4 gigahertz yes we are
getting up to the point where desktop
memory is like as fast as video card
memory was not that long ago which is
pretty cool
if you ask me so Patriots Viper extreme
division two series memory kits are
designed for Intel small they say second
generation Core processors but I
actually don't buy that because really
this kind of frequency is not not
necessarily as easily achievable on a
Sandy Bridge processor as it is on the
new Ivy Bridge processor so all of a
sudden these high speed memory kits with
new z77 boards and Ivy Bridge processors
are going to become a lot more
interesting because you can pretty much
effortlessly set them up on an Ivy
Bridge platform so you can see here
we've got copper spreaders on the bottom
okay here you can kind of yeah there you
can see the copper spreader that goes
over the RAM chips itself can you see it
not really okay what's in there
and then connect it to the copper
spreaders you've got aluminum heat
shields that also spread heat and help
to dissipate heat from the memory I mean
honestly I don't know how much of a
factor it is this is only one point six
five volt memory unless you're going
really crazy on it it probably doesn't
you know need the eight pounds of copper
and aluminum that's attached to it but
they look pretty badass in so we're
gonna go ahead and install these in one
of our z77 boards and see how it goes so
here's my Ivy Bridge test platform this
is with a four point something four
point six gigahertz 3770k and my
standard testing kingston hyperx ddr3
1600 so what i'm gonna do is i'm going
to see just how you know plug and play
this new 2.4 gigahertz memory from
patriot is so the full specs
our hymn to 2400 megahertz and then the
latencies are 11:00 11:00 11:30 it's an
8 gig kit running at 1.6 5 volts here we
go there it is installed all we had to
do was enable the XMP profile and there
are these settings that are promised on
the package there look there's the
memory running in the system it looks
pretty ballin out so let's see if we
actually you know what let's do this in
real time
okay so motherboard settings save and
exit save changes in reboot yes so let's
find out if it works together how easy
is it we will soon know when the
computer boots up and let's see how long
Linus can keep talking about nothing
while he waits for a computer to boot
it's a good thing it has an SSD because
Oh incidentally also a patriot SSD
that's a wildfire in there one of the
fastest SSDs out there still booting up
right it's a good thing it has an SSD
because that means I don't have to kill
quite as much time it's also a good
thing this motherboard has a really fast
post you guys see that it's flash green
done starting Windows ready to go
although this is a very beat-up copy of
Windows in the sense that it has like a
billion different drivers on it and a
ton of different utilities and startup
nonsense
however it should still boot reasonably
quickly there we go let's see if it
worked
so if you're really committed to running
high frequency memory then it looks like
Ivy Bridge is pretty simple to do it on
as long as you buy high frequency memory
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and test of Patriots viper-two extreme
division to our viper extreme division
to 2400 megahertz ddr3 ram don't forget
to subscribe to me on youtube let's see
how long I keep watching this
Slick's laughing in the background not
sure if you can hear that or not it's a
good thing someone thinks I'm funny okay
here oh yeah yeah supersonic XT that's
his USB Drive he's running to get more
Patriot stuff wait for it wait for it or
don't wait for it it's fun you don't
have to yes more Patriot stuff you'll
find more you'll find more wait for it
oh yeah wildfire box oh yeah
Tyra Missy blows more wildfire boxes wow
it's like the Patriot Museum going on in
here now okay subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
