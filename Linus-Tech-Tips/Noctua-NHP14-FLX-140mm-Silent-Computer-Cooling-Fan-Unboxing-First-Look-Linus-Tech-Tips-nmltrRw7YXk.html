of a new fan from Noctua this is the NFP
14 FLX now what the FLX suffix denotes
is that it is a flexible design so that
means that the flx fan has three
different speed settings which are
dududududu 1200 900 and 750 rpm and it
achieves this through a few different
adapters that are included with it other
key features of this 140 millimeter fan
are the impeller with vortex control
launches and will show you those in a
minute
the metal reinforcements which allow the
bla-bla-bla ultimate manufacturing
precision high durability and vibration
free running as well as a round frame
now the round frame of this fan is what
makes it so special and we'll get to
more about that in a minute
this has their updated drive bearing it
has the ssl bearing with the smooth
communication drive to ensure superb
running of smoothing by eliminating
torque variations and switching noises
etc etc basically it's a fan but what
makes it special is what we are about to
get to here in just a moment so let's
have a look at the accessories that are
included with the NFP 14 FLX
and first we have four rubber fan
mounting grommets so rather than using
screws which can transfer vibration
directly to the case not to a fans use
these little rubber mounting grommets
these are quite common but they're only
really included with higher end fans or
you have to buy them separately next we
have two low noise adapters so one is
the low noise adapter and one is the
ultra-low noise adapter so all you do is
plug these in inline with the fan and
they will make it run at a slower rpm
next we have four metal mounting screws
you can't always use those rubber
grommets and sometimes good old
fashioned mounting screws or what works
best and then we have AA adapters so
these are 120 millimeter to 140
millimeter adapter but wait - you said
this was a 140 millimeter fan well it is
because of the round frame they're
actually able to make this 140
millimeter fan compatible with 120
millimeter mounts you can see if you had
a
we're frame going around these holes
you'd have substantially less room for
the Fen so not to his engineers
ingeniously decided to make it work this
way so all you have to do is attach the
little metal bracket and you can see
that that makes it a little bit wider a
little bit further out so you can just
attach it to a 140 millimeter hole or to
a 120 millimeter hole very cool
now the vortex control notches are what
we'll talk about next here and let's
just have a quick look at the fan here
so you can see that they're offset we've
got two notches here at the edge of the
blade we have two notches here at the
middle of the blade and two notches here
closer to the center of the fan now what
that means is that the way these disrupt
the airflow is supposed to be more even
overall because they're offset this way
versus having all of the blades shaped
exactly the same way Dokdo has been
doing this on all of their fans for
quite a while now and obviously they're
very very well regarded fans because
people paying very good money for not to
a fans now another thing they've got
called out here is the metal reinforced
SSO bearing shell and magnet so that's
kind of cool I suppose ok it comes with
a sleeved three pin connector and the
last accessory is probably something I
should have mentioned before and it is a
three pin two molex connector so you can
power this thing any way you want you
can power it at any speed you want and
you can mount it any way you want
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and product overview of the Noctua NF P
14 ethyl X okay that wasn't really the
end I've reboxed the fan already but
what I noticed when I was Reebok Singh
it is this little tab right here in huge
boldface type so that I couldn't
possibly miss it says open and we can
actually open up this this merchandising
thing on the back of the fan so we can
find out exactly how the vortex control
Naja's work because my explanation was
just terrible okay so standard trailing
edges can produce rotating pressure
fields and vertices that cause audible
noise at distinct frequencies this
unhhhh this undesired tonal noise is
much more annoying than noise that's
spread over a broad frequency range so
that is what the vortex control notches
do they make it split into several
smaller vortices and the noise is spread
over a wider
to frequencies and is therefore much
less perceptible so there you go thank
you for checking out my unboxing and my
little add-on about the nf p14 FLX</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
