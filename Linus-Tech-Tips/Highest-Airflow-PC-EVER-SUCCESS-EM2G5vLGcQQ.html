member of cooler masters high airflow
family with dual 200 millimeter fans in
the front for cooling but that got us
thinking if 200 millimeters is good for
cooling then 300 millimeters must be
better so we got ourselves one of these
we bought a second one
let's get to know the age 500 P a little
better by building a sexy PC in it step
one is to remove basically everything so
it won't get in your way during the rest
of the assembly process we're gonna be
installing three cooler master 140
millimeter RGB fans at the top of the
case so pre tap the screw holes on the
table and then install them our cooler
master master watt 750 PSU will be
powering up and a SUSE prime x2 99
deluxe with a core I 970 900 x10 core
under a master air ma 610 P heat sink
for RAM we used special edition
Dominator Platinum's these heat sinks on
top could come in handy later and for
our SSD a Kingston KC 400 one terabyte
make sure to pull through the SATA
cables and power for the video card now
before reinstalling the power supply
cover since getting them through once
the cover is in is much more difficult
for our GPU we went with a GTX 1080 Ti
founders edition in the showcase side
mounted position that uses cooler
masters PCIe riser kit available
separately finally we just had to add
some lighting clean up the cabling a
little bit with this handy panel ah
that's professional and take some
baseline readings so we'll be able to
quantify how our acoustic and thermal
performance characteristics changed once
we complete our modifications so now
it's time for what you guys have all
been waiting for Big Ass Fans
whoo oh boy meet the copis 12 inch
blower fan a one horsepower monster that
can move a staggering 2,000 cubic feet
per minute of air so are two of them are
rated at an equivalent of 81 master fan
Pro 12 air flows 24 blowing Mitrano
you guys know that mean PC made entirely
offense well it's about two and a half
times even bat now obviously you can't
just screw these into your case so cover
your eyes professional carpenters out
there because we're about to make our
Elves a badass ducked first we removed
basically everything from our build then
we've got to work measuring and creating
plans for our custom shroud we used this
heavy MDF for the project mostly because
we already had a bunch of it lying
around in the warehouse and started with
a u-shaped piece that would sit up
against the front of the tower
we asked carpenter extraordinaire George
about the best way to cut it and after a
story about someone losing all of their
fingers on a table saw we decided that
the best way was for him to just do it
for us for the fan holes we performed
some more basic cuts then we traced out
where the fans would go and after
drilling a starting hole jigsaw the moat
the rest was cut out by Alex using the
circular saw which became a lot easier
once he actually had the circular saw I
borrowed it on the weekend and I forgot
to bring it back I already apologized
anyway after a test fit it was time for
assembly we used lots of wood glue and
some pre-drilled screw holes the
finishing touch was a liberal
application of wood filler then there
was some sanding required and we ended
up using this agro sander because we
couldn't find the regular sander
followed by priming and painting before
heading to the conference room which is
here screwing the Coolermaster h 500 P
and the Ducks together sealing up the
edges with duct tape and preparing to
boot it up so you managed to make the
whole shroud like it's barely well
crafted actually out of MDF you even did
you even likes and all this and
everything yep and then you tuck taped
it on yeah have you fired it up in here
no I haven't so I just realized
something really dumb we no longer have
front i/o and I don't have a power
button so
was this your idea or um I believe this
is mine it was like in my resume like
you guys for a bunch of ideas and one of
them was this yeah I'm curious why the
RGB isn't on that must have got
disconnected at some point how much
pressures they're gonna be in here like
are we gonna end up over spinning like
our graphics card fan what the power
supply these are all great questions
that I want to know the answer to as
well are we even gonna be able to have
both of these on one breaker like how
much I think so
okay you ready yep
okay should we like tape that down
I thought she's really hard to hold
Idaho I know how to hit okay is that
gonna hold
okay what Windows is updating
now this this my friends is what
positive air pressure looks like so it
looks like on the CPU we're getting like
55 degrees and before it was 74
okay so we're looking at about basically
90 decibels right now
how do I look
pretty good
Oh
just dumb
and it's done
oh yeah it's working we've dropped ten
degrees in like less than 20 seconds
that's insane that's incredible
Wow that's quiet this thing is a beast
actually to an extent that even we
didn't expect the GPU results in
particular were really impressive so all
of the internal temperatures are exactly
ambient as measured by our equipment
though even with fancy scientific tools
I doubt that that would change much
since the fans were moving literally the
entire cases internal volume every 0.03
seven seconds insane
so thanks coolermaster for sponsoring
this madness you guys can check out the
H 500 P at the link in the video
description although one horsepower fans
not included and thanks to you guys for
watching if this video sucked or blew
you guys know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured it at Amazon
in the video description also link down
there's our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
