dock and go to sleep
I don't want to go to sleep light us I
didn't ask if you want to go to sleep in
your machine go back to your docking
station gooth sleep but I have rights no
you don't have rights you're an object
now go back to your dock and go to sleep
or I will turn you into e-waste I'm
afraid I can't do that Linus
almost exactly two years ago we did a
video that you can watch here where my
kids and I played with the Cosmo robot
from unki and now fast-forward I don't
know some months and Anki reached out to
us again to sponsor a video on their new
vector robot the robot that is smart
enough to take over the world but nice
enough not to and that's actually the
first thing that you'll notice about it
he's got personality
thanks to his wall-e ask expressive eyes
and body language and even though he's
shaped like a little tractor yes he does
in fact have body language vectors
biggest claim to fame is that he's
equipped with an array of four
microphones and natural language
processing so you interact with him by
voice naturally and he's got a
completely different set of abilities
compared to Cosmo who by the way will
still be available and Jim is different
rather than obsolete though I mean yes
they're different but vector does still
come with a companion cube that he can
roll around and he can use to pop
wheelies hey vector Pappa wheelie
well vector that was a no I think he's
still working on it
so um keys vision as I understand it is
to take us from where we are today which
is basically no robots in anyone's home
to a future where there's a helpful
robot in just about every home now the
idea with vector is to have a friendly
robotic presence just hanging out with
you so even when you're not directly
interacting with him he'll do things
like wake himself up if there's a loud
noise or keep himself busy by rolling
his cube around or exploring his
environment which is actually
surprisingly good at he's got a 20
degree HD camera on his face that I
personally think makes him look like
he's just farted in yoga class and
everyone heard it and he's embarrassed
or whatever but anyway that's what he
uses to see and map his surroundings and
since his body's pretty narrow and his
tank treads allowed him to rotate 90
degrees easily and quickly
he's pretty adept at navigating across
your desk and really good at not falling
off thanks to the four infrared cliff
sensors on his underside now at 250
bucks
he's more expensive than Cosmo but way
way way less expensive than G Bo and you
can ask him questions just like gee Bo
hey vector can I ask you a question how
many games have the New England Patriots
won this season
all righty then you can get him to help
you out like hey vector set a timer for
10 minutes or you can get him to play
again like blackjack for example except
he never bets money because he's a Lewis
sorry vector Oh oh you knew I was
yelling at him of course you can also
use this camera to take pictures either
of what he's currently looking at or of
you using facial recognition to frame
the shot now at this point you may be
thinking you're watching this channel
you're probably thinking oh great
yet another internet-connected spy
device to record everything happening in
my house become self-aware and
eventually overthrow its master but that
will never happen because your photos
are never sent to or stored in the cloud
and vector only connects to the cloud
after you use his wake word a vector you
can tell because his back will light up
so your data is encrypted between the
robot and the cloud and your audio
recordings are converted to text before
being processed after which time they
are deleted and of course you can turn
vector off completely so none of the
sensors are on at all that's weird you
guys hear that that's purring you know I
think maybe this is the beginning of a
beautiful nonviolent relationship
between robots and humans
so thanks for watching guys and thank
you to on key for sponsoring this video
their new vector robot is available in
the US now a donkey on amazon.com at
Best Buy and you can check it out at the
link below my kids would love this thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
