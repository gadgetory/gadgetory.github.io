visit www.samhsa.gov/dtac 77 90 this is
a 2gig card and it is an overclocked
card with their wind force cooler now as
you might imagine the 77 90 X it's
somewhere between the 77 70 and the 78
50 it uses a very similar overall
architecture to the rest of their GCN or
a graphics core next architecture but
it's basically just sort of everything
that those cards are except a little
less or a little bit more if that makes
any sense to you guys
it does support all the usual AMD Radeon
features so DirectX 11 I finna tee with
up to four displays off of this
particular card and then let's talk a
little bit about gigabytes wind force
cooler so him their brand new wind force
2x is equipped with their new triangle
cool design to 100 millimeter pwm fans
an 8 mil heat pipe thicker heat pipes
are better it's just so you guys know
and the triangle cool intro gets a
patented triangle-shaped aluminum block
into the aluminum extrusion module which
enhances the speed of heat dissipation
more effectively so that's a block right
there which basically just kind of moves
the air from going straight down to
going through the fins at an angle which
is actually sort of smart so let's see
what they put inside this particular
card is overclocked from the standard 1
gigahertz to 1.07 5 gigahertz so 1075
megahertz
comes with a Quick Start Guide a molex
to PCI Express power adapter a driver
disk which you should throw away some
foam as well as a video card itself in
an anti-static bag the anti-static bag
is sealed by a piece of tape yeah
unboxings how we love them so there we
go and the card itself is covered in a
whole bunch of little protective
coverings so check this out
this is what they're talking about with
their triangle thing so rather than just
taking the airflow that goes down
directly through the fans onto the PCB
what they're effectively doing here is
they're changing the direction a little
bit although I have to wonder how much
of it is being taken out ya know a fair
amount so the triangle piece goes all
the way out to here and all the way out
to about here so what that means is
think about it this way guys if you have
fins like this and air goes straight
through them then the air passes over
this much of the metal okay whereas if
you have a fin like this and the air
goes through this way then it gets to
pass over at this much of the metal
effectively making the heat dissipation
more efficient in theory this should
also add a little bit of extra noise a
little bit more turbulence but when
you're using large slow rotating fans I
suspect it's not going to be that much
of an issue now this particular card see
there you go more RAM on the back has
the usual complement of features I mean
there's not really much that changed
with 77 90 that's probably why AMD opted
not to go with an 8000 series name for
this particular card so it's still PCI
Express 3.0 there's the connectors that
I told you guys about which supports up
to 4 display so you've got your single
analog output there remember guys DVID
is not the same as dvi-i you can't do
dual VGA off this card you've got HDMI
as well as DisplayPort some external
exhaust however due to the design of
this cooler not a whole lot of heat it's
gonna be coming off of there you've also
got a cooler here for what must be some
drm components yeah looks like they are
it looks like what gigabytes actually
done is they've taken the 12-volt power
that comes in here routed it all the way
across the card here where it'll be
redistributed back this way because you
can see this part of the PCB is actually
quite bare and we've seen this a fair
bit on recent cards where manufacturers
are actually because they don't even
need all this PCB space but they don't
want the card to look like a little baby
card they're just leaving a lot of blank
PCB area so there you have it there's
that 8 mil heat pipe that that I was
talking about before you can see it's
like you know pretty huge compared to
there's a human pinky finger if nothing
else and then a very solid block of
aluminum makes up the rest of that
cooler design so this is a relatively
expensive cooler compared to what a
reference design card would ship with so
that heat pipe is carrying away from the
solid block cooler over to the
more thin thin type array cooler where
the second fan is doing most of its work
a single PCI Express six pin power
connector is provided and there is your
crossfire connector so the card does
support to wake Frostfire but not 3-way
or more way configurations thank you for
