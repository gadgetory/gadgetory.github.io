complete sea of random companies you've
never heard of but every once in a while
the random gets so random that I sit up
and pay attention so this is ght I don't
know exactly what they do but they've
got weird GeForce graphics cards with
sort of looks like they kind of came up
with their own way of doing the Nvidia
logo and they're kind of older ones like
we've got a GTX 650 Ti on display here
and then they've got a poster back there
let's go have a look at this one of the
biggest selling points in their booth is
apparently this x79 motherboard but
that's weird because intel hasn't made
any chips for the x79 platform in quite
literally years
so what's the deal behind this I would
like to find out so what can you tell me
about this motherboard yeah there's a
memory stock yep yes is it dual or quad
channel 4 channel okay um so where do
you get x79 chipset oh yes chips at you
yeah
but where do you get them does Intel
still make these yeah they still make
them really and then so where do you
sell a motherboard like this Sansa where
yeah I always sound to
South America South America anywhere
else South America and Asia so how do
they buy a CPU for it because Intel
doesn't make these CPUs anymore we would
collected the use this to be you you
know stick with him yeah interesting so
if I'm in North America can I buy this
oh but like I can buy this one so how
much is it okay what currency is that US
dollars okay I don't have any US dollars
I have I have NTD so how much how much
NTD
okay all right thank you so according to
the rep here they're getting genuine x79
chipset from Intel but as for the CPUs
well we know Intel doesn't make those
anymore so apparently they collect the
used ones and then they bundle them
together for customers in South America
and Asia now they don't currently have
any sales channel in North America where
I could obtain something like this but
they said the pricing is about 95 US
dollars and apparently if I can COFF up
the money right now I can buy it and
take it home with me to test
oh I even get an i/o shield Hey Deluxe
nice SATA cable okay there you go I am
the proud owner of this random
motherboard so I don't have any of the
parts that I would need to test it here
with me but that's okay I'm gonna throw
this in my bag take it home and see how
this whole thing shakes out all right
it's been a while we're back in the
studio I've got my test bench prepared
here and we're ready to find out if our
weird x79 motherboard made the trip back
to the studio in one piece but before we
even do that I've got a couple more
interesting things to share with you so
I did reach out to Intel about the
current availability of x79
legacy chipsets and their reply was
we have no idea what they're talking
about no we don't still make those so
that's cool and then number two is that
I did notice that this motherboard had
an MDOT two slot and that felt a little
weird to me at the time but it wasn't
until I googled it and I found this link
to our forum that says nvme support is
not included in the bios of x79 boards
bla bla bla etcetra etcetra basically
not a thing so naturally in addition to
Ram CPU graphics card all this good
stuff let's see if it works with this
thing
first order of business for me naturally
has to be to pop this chipset heatsink
off and have a look at what's down Oh
interesting so they've got a couple of
custom plastic shims on here to keep the
heatsink from wobbling and accidentally
cracking the dye and then they've
actually got some writing in pencil on
the chip that also appears to be fairly
scuffed up so it looks like my first
theory that they're pulling these chips
off of dead and or recycled boards and
repurposing them does appear to hold
some water especially in light of that
information from Intel so I don't know
why they wouldn't just be upfront about
that but hey one thing that is
potentially new is the socket I can't
think of a reason why Foxconn wouldn't
still be able to provide LGA 2011 socket
with that said I also don't know for
certain that it's new
that's not something we'll be able to
evaluate though because we do know that
this is a demo unit board I went with a
49 60 X so that's the top-end chip for
this platform it's a 6 core processor I
think it peaks at 4 gigahertz boost so
not too impressive by today's standards
but certainly still a very capable
machine which is exactly where the use
case for a motherboard like this really
comes from because there's still all
these very usable chips but because the
motherboards die faster than the CPUs do
there's no boards to put them in I don't
get it I'm just so weirded out right now
alright let's go ahead and install this
on my test bench and as you guys might
recall Corsair sponsored our trip to
Computex 2019 where we got this board so
we felt it was appropriate to use their
hydro X series water cooling to make
sure that we are getting the utmost out
of our weird motherboard you know we
wouldn't want to have any cooling issues
holding us back so we're gonna be going
with their XC 9 RGB CPU block which has
their pre applied thermal
pound their RGB lighting and of course
their skived micro fan base really
really tight base on that one
I haven't actually installed one of
these yet but it looks like the mounting
mechanism is about as simple as it can
be so this is the one that's designed
for the high end socket so your thread
Ripper and your Intel 80 DT all right
next we're gonna try out their
compression fittings these were made in
partnership with bits power so I'm
expecting them to be frickin well that's
power awesome so this is my first look
at the accessory package for the XD 5
RGB this is their pump reservoir combo
that I really approve of their approach
with so they've gone with like a really
really durable material for every part
of it and then they've gone with a
genuine laying D 5 pump just rebranding
it sometimes you're better off building
something new from scratch but sometimes
you're better off just going with
something that you know is awesome and
the D 5 is a really good choice there
it's really well regarded not just for
its performance but also for its
reliability 360 degree God for their
radiators Corsair partnered with
hardware labs a longtime industry
veteran fun fact hardware labs was
actually one of the first vendors that I
ever placed an order with when I was
working as a product manager at NCIX
so technically I ordered with them
before I was actually a product manager
I was still working in like the customer
care area and answering support tickets
about computer systems so so remember
when bits power came onto the scene I
was like oh so your entire company is
making water cooling fittings good luck
with that
and here we are partnerships with
Corsair now my test bench GPU is
decidedly last-gen so I'm not going to
be water cooling my card but I did want
to address some of the comments I made
about this thing in my video where I
upgraded my personal rig where I
criticized some things as cost-saving
measures when it turns out they were
actually very expensive to do like the
molding for this piece up here it feels
like kind of a cheap plastic but as it
turns out it's made out of like this
super rugged stuff that was
really really expensive to do the
workforce so there you have it I also
called their back plate flimsy if I
recall correctly and they were like okay
fair point but - its PCI certified so
you can actually install it slot to slot
with another card that's something that
you can't do with the thicker ones and I
was like now this is one key thing that
I would have done differently from the
Corsair on this product line I wouldn't
have gone with a thin wall tubing I like
me a 3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD tubing but
the reason that they did it this way is
that if you use their dies you end up
with less of that kind of transparent
you know border effect and it ends up
looking more like that color just kind
of flowing around your system so that's
their justification this stuff does tend
to be a little bit harder to keep from
kinking but because it's nice and
pliable it's also not too bad either
fun fact I pioneered the concept of
selling tubing as pre-cut 10 foot
lengths as far as I'm aware I forced our
suppliers back when I was at NCIX
to stop selling by the foot to us
because we had no way of tracking it as
a single SKU and made them create part
numbers for me of 10 foot rolls which I
had determined were the right amount to
plumb a basic system and not too much
overkill for a much bigger one I do have
to give corsair credit for a first
attempt this really is very simple to do
like there's not much to screw up other
than getting the inlet and outlet wrong
on the CPU block or the pump and as long
as you consult the manual you shouldn't
have trouble with that anyway I bet to
makers of this motherboard we're never
expecting tight next to be installed on
it let's see if it handles it okay I'm
sure Corsair has a better way for me to
fill this but
wait wait wait gotta get that better
product placement in there
this board does not have a lot of fan
headers on it huh so yeah we're getting
two fans here kids what have I gotten us
into you know what I'm gonna use the
SATA cable that they provided me
nice SATA cable alright not bad okay so
this motherboard actually has like
jumpers for what would normally be BIOS
settings on it
this one is J power 1 2 2 1 &amp;amp; 2 is
always power 2 &amp;amp; 3 is s Oh power there
it is
highest classic start menu installed on
this whose Drive is this so I plugged in
my SATA Drive thinking I'll deal with
that first and then I'll try the envy me
one later and check this out it booted
up right to my nvme SSD no configuration
no hassle nothing we're running nvme on
x79 to put this in perspective not only
does a fully-featured x79 board like
this x79 deluxe from a soos not have an
MDOT to slot on it see that you can't
even just like put a PCI Express to MDOT
to riser card in it because to my
knowledge none of the motherboard
manufacturers like the mainstream ones
implemented the support for booting from
it not necessarily because the chipset
couldn't do it it's just PCI Express
just because they were legacy products
and not supported so the fact that this
thing exists kind of blows my mind
before we go any further priorities
gotta get our RGB lighting hooked up now
obviously I'm not doing the greatest job
of cable management here right now but I
think you guys get the point
to daisy-chain this one here okay and
hey now it's time for the moment you've
been waiting for we're gonna do a quick
Cinebench r15 run and see if this
thing's actually even frickin stable if
it
turbos up correctly now our scores a
little on the low side but something I
noticed when I was checking out our
turbo speeds is that our memory is only
running at 1333 megahertz so maybe we
can go into the BIOS and do a little bit
of tuning well that is a retro looking
BIOS right there if I've ever seen one
Northbridge configuration modern
motherboards and by modern I even mean
this one do not have North bridges but I
see what they mean here the North Bridge
used to be the link between the memory
and the CPU so this has all the memory
settings in it I see where they're going
with it all right so we can load up an
XMP profile so that's cool well okay
then so there are a lot of settings in
here but whether or not they do anything
appears to be a different story
there's no way that's accurate so
wherever their probe is somewhere in the
middle of nowhere all right it's
starting to show its weakness a little
bit our XMP profile does not appear to
have in fact done anything I mean this
is an extreme edition processor
overclocking it should be as simple as
changing the multiplier but now that I
think about it I didn't see any voltage
adjustments in there you know we take
for granted that an x79 motherboard
should be very expensive but the part of
the reason that they're so expensive is
because they have this much more robust
vrm solution that's designed to deliver
tons and tons of current within like a
very very narrow margin if anyone was
crazy enough to build a super basic
hundred dollar board for you know CPUs
that start at 4 or 500 dollars for the
lineup I guess this is kind of what it
would look like no memory overclock I'll
give it this it has really good failed
boot condition recovery all these
buttons you can tweak and then when they
don't work it's like hey didn't work
it's fine we didn't expect that to work
anyway put it back to default hey it
turbos up to 3.9 in a lighter load so
yeah we're getting close to that max 4
gigahertz turbo Oh
okay honestly though that's everything I
needed to know that's a pretty smooth
gamey experience okay so with some quick
Craig's listing we've got 20 bucks for
four gigs so that you could do 16 gigs
times four sticks for 80 bucks so
somewhere between 60 and 80 bucks gets
you either quad-channel 16 gigs or
dual-channel 16 gigs all right so you
can get a 39 60 X for a hundred US
dollars and then this board is like a
hundred bucks so we're talking less than
the price of a brand-new CPU potentially
for a bored RAM and CPU if you're
willing to do some bargain hunting okay
so we've got ourselves a pretty cool
budget little gaming platform here but I
can't take credit for this idea was
actually David my cameraman today who
came up with this there's one more thing
that we can try out could it possibly
support SLI okay well that answers that
question David you know what it was a
good idea
so there it is guys yeah it wasn't a
perfect experience but I mean that's
Deus Ex mankind divided running on very
high 2560 by 1440 and looking pretty
freakin OnPoint so as far as budget
gaming systems go if you can get your
hands on one of these my understanding
is you can find listings for it on sites
like Aliexpress under different brands
presumably they are rebadging it then
hey it looks like honestly not a
terrible option we didn't have any
compatibility issues it boots up fast
and the nvme MDOT 2dr worked exactly as
expected
on another note massive thanks to
Corsair for sponsoring this video as
well as our coverage of Computex 2019 in
general their hydro X lineup of water
cooling is super simple to use looks
absolutely fantastic and we had no
performance complaints about it during
this video whatsoever so you can check
that out at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one
and oh yeah soon-to-be this one this
one's really cool as well as our
community forum which you guys should
