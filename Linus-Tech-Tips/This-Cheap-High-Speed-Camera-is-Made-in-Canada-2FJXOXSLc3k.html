that it was only seven months ago that
Kron Technologies having raised over
half a million dollars for their Cronos
one point for affordable high speed
camera on Kickstarter moved from the
founders garage into what could probably
be best described as the founders much
more bigger much more better garage well
it was so things are a little rough
around the edges in this group of seven
or eight somehow they weren't exactly
sure when I asked them of big nerds
basically happy well hey it's true it's
true and you know it as I was saying
this group of big nerds hasn't got the
place fully set up yet in a conventional
sense but in some ways that's what's
really exciting about it come with me
and take a peek behind the curtains of a
real startup the Silicon Valley vibe is
definitely real and this place is
seriously cool if you're into that sort
of thing speaking of being into that
sort of thing if you're into
high-quality computers this video is
brought to you by Origin PC they build
beautiful custom desktops they sell high
performance laptops and they offer
lifetime 24/7 tech support they use only
high quality products like samsung's 960
pro m2 SSDs which offer amazing
performance visit Origin PC today
through the link below to learn more
the place looks like a typical office
that is at least until you actually poke
your head into any of the actual
workspaces so this is loyals cubicle
where in addition to a laptop on a stand
and an extra monitor he's got another
extra monitor and he's got an
oscilloscope for measuring electrical
signals off of probes as well as a
gorgeous piece of microscope rehear that
he uses to hand solder a bages which are
sort of last-minute quick fixes to bad
boards or bad batches of boards or the
very very delicate leads that you see on
a board like this which are required to
probe CPU functionality or Ram signaling
so it was actually through this board
here that Kron technologies was able to
get two sticks of memory working bumping
their maximum capacity to 32 gigs that
is double what similar competitors can
offer but how did we get here to answer
that we're going to take a look at the
museum a collection of development board
PCBs screwed two pieces of plywood
sitting on a boardroom table that was
clearly along with the chairs around it
acquired from some other companies
bankruptcy auction so this this is the
first Chronos it was built and
programmed single-handedly by Kron
technologies founder david cron Stein he
loved the cool stuff that Mythbusters
was doing back in the mid-2000s but as a
student he couldn't afford even the
inexpensive Olympus that he found on
eBay for 3500 bucks so he went you know
what screw it I'm gonna make my own so
this first iteration here completed in
2008 was made of off-the-shelf
development kits that were relatively
limited compared to what's available in
the Maker scene today it was only
capable of 640 by 480 resolution
at 240 frames per second max so not
game-changing but it worked and it only
cost him 500 bucks that is to say if you
don't count time the second gen refines
the original design it wasn't more
compact but it could record a 1280 by
1024 and add up to 500 frames per second
so now we're getting somewhere
by the third gen it was 2012 or 2015
depending on how you count and thanks to
a foldable board design the PCB along
with all of the other components could
be fitted into a custom 3d printed ABS
housing so this was the first one that
was capable of looking like an actual
camera then we've got some kind of
prototype you looking things 3d printed
metal wood this was apparently for
designing the feel of the grip and then
finally the Kronos 1.4 so this is the
actual camera that shipped to
Kickstarter backers back in mid summer
last year it's not that cheap in fact
I'm sure the irony of a price tag that
his 2006 self wouldn't have been able to
afford isn't lost on David
but the capabilities of the Kronos 1.4
far exceed that camera he saw on ebay
it's got a form factor that is very
similar to a normal spills picture
camera it takes standard c-mount lenses
and it can capture burst shots and video
either raw or converted to mp4 at
resolutions of up to 1280 by 1024 and
frame rates of up to thirty eight
thousand five hundred frames per second
if you wanted something comparable from
one of the big guys in the space you
could get that and it would probably
have more features so David's team knows
that they need to continue to add
functionality through firmware updates
going into the future but it would cost
you four to five
fines as much or more so knowing that
price is one of their advantages David's
team is building their cameras in this
workshop here behind me right here in
Canada around standard commodity parts
with careful attention to whether they
or their users really need something
fancier especially if it comes at the
cost of creating or buying something
proprietary the arm cortex a8 based CPU
that runs the user interface is actually
about nine years old but in general
h.264 encoders haven't really changed
that much in that time outside of the
very high-end so they're sticking with
it for now and there are a ton of
examples of this kind of thing a lot of
work was put into making it possible to
pull data off the sensor at high speed
into the ramp with a $35 FPGA
by contrast the analogous FPGAs and a
phantom camera could cost thousands of
dollars the touchscreen is actually from
a Chinese manufacturer
I think yep there's one here off of
digi-key or mouse or something like that
and the RAM this is what actually holds
the buffered video because the data
rates are so high it's just standard
notebook ddr3 sodium Ram off of Lake
Newegg and this philosophy of openness
continues in the user accessories so you
can just use off-the-shelf laptop
adapters to power it if you want a
battery pack you just need to pick up an
icon Iain el4 a battery pack and in
terms of storage so once you dump off of
the RAM onto something more permanent
you can use a standard SD card you can
just use a USB device you can use
powered eSATA and coming soon they've
even got Ethernet so what we end up with
is a finished product that is
surprisingly robust thanks to the thick
aluminum machines chassis so this one
right here actually got hit by a 300
kilometer per hour
ice ball and survived
then this one was actually pulled into
an industrial filing machine and now
obviously the LCD didn't make it but the
rest of the internals actually did
survive with only minimal damage to the
outside of the chassis so behind me here
David is actually capturing colored
water droplets at 1500 frames per second
and this is absolutely incredible
now the monochrome version does give you
a little bit higher effective resolution
and it requires only half as much light
which is really really important for
high-speed videography but it doesn't
have quite the wow factor of the color
one okay we got to go find some more
cool stuff to do so this one right
here's a lot of fun this is called a
kaboosh kaboosh kaboosh
so this was actually oh how they created
the effect in the stargate portals let's
go have a look at it okay so we're all
set up David's running at 1500 frames
per second there Sean's got 6,000 and
then we've got a third camera here at
6000 Loma truth time ah all right let's
have a look hey that's beautiful of
course we're not done yet though what
slo-mo video would be complete without
some destruction for that we will need
what they call the low hem room so in
here you will find not one not two not
three not four but five of their Chronos
1.4 cameras a flipped over lawnmower
that you can drop stuff in a reinforced
plywood whatever that means cage as well
as a mesh roof and the world's most
technologically advanced
dropping mechanism a dowel with a piece
of string this gonna be fun oh right
one last thing hit the lights for 1,000
watt LEDs water-cooled
with about one third of the brightness
of the Sun so we don't miss any of the
action
Wow
is there anything protecting those
cameras all right next up we've got a
Fuji film tape tape drive tape like a
backup tape whoa
something hit this door pretty friggin
hard Wow what the hell looks like there
was a party in here and everyone was
invited and for our last trick the guys
who put spray foam into our warehouse
expansion destroyed all of our cardboard
cutouts from LTX last year see they're
all stained and stuff so I'm gonna let
you the viewers vote leave a comment
with who you want to see shredded
because we're only gonna do one Linus
Taryn Dennis or Luke and don't cheat
leave a comment if it really works
really oh all right let's see if we can
figure out how to put me into the
lawnmower here all right I think I'd
rather go in headfirst end the suffering
I'm finding your your work place very
high test I'm high I'm finding this to
be a high disc workplace okay all right
you know what I'm just gonna whip this
arm
so that was a lot of fun and at three to
four thousand dollars a pop depending on
how long of a record buffer you want
these things are actually within the
reach of affluent hobbyists who want to
load up an air cannon with bouncy balls
and record the hilarity or whatever else
but the main market for these and
they're apparently shipping upwards of
four hundred of these devices per year
now at the current rate and this is
ignoring Kickstarter our research
institutions universities the
manufacturing sector I mean you can
imagine it would be a lot easier to you
know debug faulty robot arm that screws
on bottle caps if you can really see
what it's doing as well as Armorer's and
trigger manufacturers and even rocket
thrust researchers because there's so
much lower cost than the other options
available that you could have several of
them giving you multiple angles on it at
a time something that's absolutely
invaluable they even support
synchronizing the cameras so you can
record stereo 3d of what's going on
6,000 plus frames per second so I'm
really excited about what these guys are
doing I was absolutely thrilled to find
out that they're in my backyard in
Burnaby British Columbia and I wish them
all the best apparently they're hiring
right now what was it software and
hardware engineers so sorry it was yeah
software engineers with Linux kernel
experience and hardware with FPGA
experience FPGA experience is the big
one so yeah these guys have got big
plans wish you guys the best of luck
because what you're doing here is
awesome and speaking of plans that are
awesome ting is our sponsor for today
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction and with ting it's awesome
because you don't need a
one-size-fits-all plan you pay for only
what you use with the average ting bill
coming in at just $23 a month per device
per month I've said month twice but it's
okay you guys get the point and you
don't have to skimp on customer service
either when you call ting you will speak
to a real human being and you can
find out if you'll save money on ting at
Linus ENCOM we're gonna have that link
below it's their savings calculator you
punch in your last couple bills and
it'll tell you how much you'll save if
you switch to ting they'll cover 25% of
your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and
if you use our link you can get another
$25 off towards a new device or off your
first bill so check it out at the link
