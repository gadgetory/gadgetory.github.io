extreme this is an ultimate extreme
performance CPU cooling cooler called
the C NPS 11x on the back we find some
information which is pretty typical
alright
powerful cooling performance q max of up
to 350 watts v-shape dual heatsink
design for optimal airflow composite
heat pipe heat transfer capacity
enhanced 1.5 x okay we have composite
heat pipes which means that they are not
a typical axial groove they are not a
typical sintered metal type but they
actually use axial grooves and centered
metal in order to speed up the flow of
the liquid and yes it is a liquid or a
vapor or whatever the phase that it
happens to be and that is inside the
heat pipe so let's explain how heat
pipes work real quick I actually saw a
hilarious hardware bought that someone
did where they cut off the top of their
heat pipes on their cooler so that their
side panel would fit so they took their
cooler they just cut off all the tops of
the heat pipes and they're like oh my
cooler so bad my CPU overheats was
terrible yes that would happen and the
reason for that is that key pipes on the
inside have a little bit of liquid
sometimes it's water sometimes it's
something else depending on what kind of
heat pipes you're talking about and what
that liquid does is it goes down to the
CPU where it becomes a liquid then the
CPU because it's hot inside the CPU heat
pipe it's low pressure right so the
boiling point is much lower so so it
gets hot even at 40 degrees 50 degrees
it boils it evaporates and then the
vapor flows up to the top of the heat
pipe where it's cool where it gets
cooled by the fan and the fins that it's
attached to and all that good stuff and
then turns back to a liquid and runs
back down to the CPU now well then how
does it keep might work if it's not
right-side up like this well that is
what the axial grooves
and the centered metal r4 they cause the
liquid to make its way back down to the
CPU no matter what alright so there you
learned something today if you don't
know how when you punch it you also
learned that it's not a good idea to cut
them because I'm table they'll perform
about as well as a tube of copper which
doesn't perform very well for carrying
large amounts of heat
I always love the look of Zalman he
thinks although I've done almost nothing
in terms of Zalman unboxings on my
YouTube channel here so why don't we do
accessories first where we will find
lots of little parts oh wow okay so
sockets it's going to be compatible with
all the latest sockets including 1155
1156 1366 7 7 5 a.m. 2 a.m. 2 plus and
a.m. 3 ok so this looks like Intel this
looks like probably AMD no this looks
like Intel this I don't know what it
looks like basically you got one of
these you got some thermal grease you
got one of these you got a sticker got
some pads and ok you got a 4 pin PWM fan
connector adapter to make your 4 pin PWM
fan quieter so yes it's got a little
inline resistor which is awesome I love
those I have a little collection of them
at home you got some of those some of
those hey you got some back plates well
you got one back plate I'm gonna do this
ahh that's how I open bags today ok so
your back plate is going to protect your
mother boy from warping or breaking when
you put this heavy a little cooler on it
although I'll tell you guys the CNP s 11
X is not that heavy now the first thing
I notice about this cooler is that this
is one of the most dense thin
arrangements I have ever seen on a CPU
cooler now what that allows allman to do
is have more surface area now well mu
more surface area that means better
cooling right yes in most cases more
surface area means better cooling so
what if I like ramped it up and I made
the surface area just a solid mass well
then we wouldn't have better cooling
because no air would pass through that
would be bad
so more surface areas
as long as you can push air through it
so what Zalman has done is they have
made these areas with fins actually
quite thin okay so you can see the fins
are not very thick okay and then what
they've done is they've enclosed it
completely on the top with plastic and
the bottom with another plastic shroud
and then they put a big beefy fan on the
front of it nice big blades I'm gonna go
ahead and assume they've designed this
for static pressure more than anything
else so it's not gonna spin out a huge
rpm or anything like that actually what
RPM ya up to up to about 2,000 rpm okay
so that is gonna be designed to push air
through this not necessarily at a high
rate of speed but at a fast enough rate
to pull a lot of heat away from it so
let's compare surface area right so this
has what appears to be like look at this
compared to a coarser H or a 70 I mean
that could be up to hold on okay move
the camera for a sec so I can see okay
that looks like about double the fin
density of an 870 so in literally half
this the physical size it can have the
same surface area as an 870 pretty neat
okay heatpipes terms of heat pipes we've
got five heat pipes that are not heat
pipe direct touch although that doesn't
always provide a performance advantage
anyway but we've got a very smooth
looking base there's your obligatory
finger shot where you can see how shiny
that is the base appears to be convex
based on looking at the reflection of my
light through it okay so what that means
is that with high mounting pressures you
got nice good contact between the base
and the CPU five heat pipes making
contact all along the base that are
going to be and that which is then
touching your CPU what else we got here
so yeah it's a 120mm fan which I
mentioned a couple times it looks like
you can replace the fan which was one of
my complaints about my very first is
allman cooler which was a CN PS 7000 I
got the Cu version I decided to go all
out and get the heavy cu version which
everyone assured me was going to break
my motherboard but I didn't come on we
have coolers now that are like three
four times five times the size of that
thing and weight
no problem but anyway that was one of my
complaints about that heatsink was that
I wasn't able to change the fan but it
looks like they've remedied that you can
put on whatever 120mm fan you please I
think that's pretty much it that's all I
wanted to say thank you for checking out
my unboxing today the CNP s 11x ultimate
extreme performance don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos oh and one thing all else to
mention about this fen is that it has
blue LEDs so I just need to find a hold
on which one's the rpm sensor there we
go
yeah blue LED fan C glows and stuff
