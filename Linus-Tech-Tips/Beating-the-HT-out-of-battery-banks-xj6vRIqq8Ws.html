to learn more so for today's video we're
going to be doing a durable battery bank
deathmatch so we've got the unified you
eight to one and Amazon basics which is
just going to be our control group
because that's not actually a durable
battery bank a cheero
tough a power power active and a jar of
tank what I'm going to do is drop them
from a certain height then dunk them
underwater at a certain height and then
increase the height and/or depth
depending on what test we're doing back
to back to back to back until we have
one survivor or possibly more than one
because I don't know how deep and how
high I can get but I'm expecting it'll
come down to one survivor so let's begin
so the first depth test is just going to
be on this first step we're not going
that deep the amazonbasics is probably
going to die the rest of them probably
going to live let's try it I'm making
all this making sure all the seals are
fairly tight before I put them in the
jarv seal is a little bit more finicky
than some of the other ones this one
like floats so new looking at IP ratings
destined for a half an hour at X depth
depending on the IP rating that you have
I'm not gonna leave these underwater for
half an hour because honestly if you
drop it in the water you should get it
within that time and if you can't get it
within half an hour is probably gonna be
under the water for a lot longer than
half an hour and we're not going to make
this like a six day battery bank death
match so leave it on the water for like
five minutes at a time and then it's
probably fine also because I'm trying to
put them on the same surface I'm not
just dropping them into the water that
might happen later but for this first
step thing I put them in one by one so
if I have it be a little bit longer like
five something minutes and not just a
dunk then it's a higher chance that
everything is more evil okay so I'm
going to take them out of the water now
got them up I don't want to get water
like in the USB thing while I'm charging
it
so the amazonbasics is gonna be a little
rough but the other one should be okay
we've moved on to Dennis's iPhone sorry
- we'll probably be fine let's start off
with the cheero so there's a little bit
of moisture under the water seal for the
cheero but I don't see any moisture like
in the USB ports or anything like that
so we'll see yeah so that one works we
wonder the uniform a little bit of
moisture but not much and this could be
from when I open it Moisture kind of
goes in yeah that one works jarv tank
this one doesn't have any moisture
inside that one works fine moving on to
the foss power that one works fine
amazonbasics
let's see
does it live on alright PM is on basics
it's dead so I made it through the drop
test but the second hit water this guy
was out we did see bubbles come from it
right when we dunked it so we're pretty
sure that was done and then there were
four let's drop them from higher okay so
the next drop test is up should be
rather simple I'm just gonna hold them
up and then drop them this is about
seven and a half feet so here we go the
jarv
ran away a little bit I'm not that
surprised because there's this really
kind of intense rubber on the sides that
probably makes it bounce a whole bunch
so the scarf almost ran into the water
it almost had an advanced test okay
starting with the foss power
works fine now the unifor we drop them
so that's just something to note the
unified is dead so it wasn't just the
cover coming off the unified actually
isn't working anymore if you look at it
I'm going to press the power button
I'm repeatedly pressing the power button
the lights are not shining I tried in
this USB port and press the power button
the phone doesn't react at all
so yes the unifying is out of the race
that's actually earlier than I expected
so our IP yuna fund so if you look at
the unifying there's like there's a chip
on like quite a few of the corners as
you can see it impacted very very hard
with the ground all of the remaining
battery banks have at least some form of
rubbery material on the outside the
cheero the faust our and the jar all
have a rubbery like it material that's
going to take impacts the unified does
not it just have that hard shell so yeah
i think that might be what killed it
alright jarv is the next one this one
almost ran away on us and has the most
rubbery material around it so I'm
assuming it's fine and it is completely
fine immediately started working and
last but hopefully not least is the
cheer oh well I guess quite technically
not least at this point but anyways
going the choooo choooo works fine we're
down to three
all of them have proper rubbery shock
absorption and all of them are water
resistant so just observing some damage
here on the foss power you can see like
a little bit of a bite in right there
but it doesn't really matter is that has
nothing to do with the actual durability
or the water resistance of the unit as
it's all kind of contained within here
which still seems so some moisture from
the last submersion test but seems
completely fine in terms of integrity so
that guy's things we doing ok the cheer
oh did land on the button bit i've kind
of cleaned it off and it seems fine but
there's no visual damage and other than
that it actually seems to be completely
okay i would be hard-pressed to say that
this had been dropped at all if you just
hand it to me randomly
the jarv on the other hand once we
popped it open we did notice that there
was some dents on that raised part on
the inside and I'm kind of wondering you
can see where it landed on the the
rubbery part on the outside I am
wondering if that is going to compromise
its integrity so we're going into the
water test jarv can you hold on one
important note about the jarv tank is
that it's seal can actually be a little
bit tricky so when you're putting it in
you need to make sure that you've
pressed down everywhere because it
doesn't like to sit naturally on its own
including where the hinges you got to
make sure you go all the way along the
back and then you might be able to
notice it's still a little bit puffy and
that's because the seals on the inside
haven't even gone in yet so we need to
push this area down as well and make
sure that everything goes in that's
because when I take it off you can see
these plugs for the USB ports those
don't even naturally go in so you have
to make sure that they go in as well and
seal everything else off or else you're
going to lose like all of your water
resistance so our first water dunk test
was at about three four inches now we're
going to about like three and
three-quarters to four feet none of this
is exact for not measuring any of it
we're basing it off of like my height so
don't worry too much about it here we go
I'm sure that was sexy anyways they
don't have our batteries I need to try
them out happening
the cheero has some moisture just like
last time but again just like last time
not in the USB port that's probably
because it has the extension under the
top and plug it in no response
immediately yeah no lights at all zero -
that's unfortunate
ok moving on to the Foss power I think
it stopped a little bit of moisture just
like last time but not near the USB port
like that four and a half feet for five
minutes was the great bringer of death
boss powers dead as well moving on to
the jar of tank it is the most expensive
but also might be the last one left oh
there's water under the seal even though
I was very sure that I did it properly
although that might have been because of
the damage that happened when it was
dropped from 7.5 feet if this one's dead
to you that would be kind of a tall the
jar of tank survives instantly worked
still shows full power we're gonna have
a special remaining test for the jar of
tank but as far as I'm concerned it wins
we're just going to see how much it can
take at this point alright it's our last
remaining battery bank I'm now going to
throw it at that rock wall let it hit
the wall fall into the water and then
see if it survives after that okay so
it's a little bit unfortunate that a few
of the other ones didn't survive because
while the jarv tank is still alive it's
also really hard to see it's all black
so if you did happen to drop it
somewhere like underwater and it was
even the slightest bit murky it would be
really hard
okay so I found it it didn't come that
far off the wall I think it's a glance
downwards afterwards it's probably about
six feet underwater we're gonna leave it
for five minutes if it does survive this
we'll do some other tests after that see
even Sarai's those as well but it
survives this I'll be pretty impressed
because after the impact it is very
likely that that water seal came off so
see how it does okay so it's been about
five minutes I'm gonna go grab it now so
you can survive but I don't think so but
the water seals completely off so uh
that's probably ripped jar oh my god the
lights are still on what mice don't work
so it survived that craziness now I'm
going to try smashing into the ground a
few times see if it survives that if it
still lives we'll try some more crazy
water stuff but there we go
lights are still on although they're
like flashing the second you plug the
phone in the light stops flashing and it
charges just fine
the jarv tank is still alive so at this
point the seal for the water is like
completely non functioning and the
battery is slightly bent but it's still
working I think we're getting into like
a little bit dangerous category here I
think it's that I think it's finally
dead so just surveying the damage here
this corner where I threw it down on is
pretty beat-up
like it's actually lifted if you look on
the inside I can like almost peel back
this corner of like the sticker that's
on it or whatever I don't think it's
alive anymore I'm pretty sure it's
definitely conquered at this point but I
dropped it from five feet adopted from
seven a half feet it was under water at
about three inches was under water about
four feet his underwater against a wall
really hard with its water seal coming
off and then at six feet for about five
minutes and then I smashed into the
ground it kept working even though it
was bent and then I smashed him to the
ground two more times
to the point where it's like cracking
and it finally died I think that's
pretty solid in my opinion so it's a few
days later and in a completely different
location but I did want to cover a few
things and I'm going to cover them
starting in order of which battery bank
died so starting with the Amazon basics
it didn't claim anything in its title in
terms of durability and it's cheap and
it's an Amazon basics product so it's
probably just going to work that was its
that was its selling point not its
durability so I'm not surprised that it
died almost immediately when it touched
water but I was pretty impressed that it
survived the first drop the next one to
die was the unified u8 - 1 this one
totes in its title that it is waterproof
which is not true it has an IP rating of
IP 66 which doesn't even mean that it's
immersion rated it means that it is
rated for at least 3 minutes of 100
litres per minute with a pressure of 100
kPa and a distance of 3 meters of like a
water jet being shot at it
not immersive just like a water gun and
it died from a drop that none of the
other battery banks died from which was
a little bit disappointing because it
wasn't really that bad but oh my
goodness is it cheap when it's on sale
and it's basically always on sale so
there you go next up was a tie between
the Foss power power active and the
cheero tough starting with the Foss
power it claims that it is waterproof
shockproof and dust proof in the title
for the product one of those is true not
two of them and that is that it is dust
proof which is not very hard to do its
water resistance rating is ip67 which is
three feet or one meter for half an hour
it died outside of this rating being at
slightly over 4 feet underwater so I
guess it did pretty well in that regard
but it did lie about its capabilities in
the title the cheero advertised itself
properly by saying in the title that it
is water resistant shock resistant and
dust proof which is true it is also ip66
rated which is the same as the unifo but
did survive underwater for a little
while and didn't die until we had it
slightly over 4 feet underwater so props
to cheero then there's the jarv tank
which also lied in its title no it is
not waterproof and no it is not
shockproof it does have an IP rating of
67 with the cap closed and 65 with the
cap open which is
allure to the shooting water edit thing
but just not quite as aggressive it took
shocks like a boss with me smashing
against a wall and then repeatedly
smashing the gates to the ground and it
managed salt water even with very very
good levels well beyond its actual
rating with the cap off over six feet
underwater and managing completely fine
very impressive just disappointed that
it lied in its title I'm going to
personally stick with the cheero tough
and yes they were a sponsor of ours way
in the past I know some people are going
to point that out but they were not a
sponsor of this video at all we bought
the cheer Oh tough that we used in this
video and the reason why I'm choosing
them is not because they were a sponsor
but because they were the only ones that
didn't lie in the Amazon product title
for their item and I actually respect
