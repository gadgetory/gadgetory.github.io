of the FSP Arum series our MCM series
and I'll get to what that means in a
moment Gold 750 watt power supply they
have their W upside down actually they
intended for that to be an Abba not
moron that has a five year warranty it
is 80 plus gold as you may or may not
have been able to figure out by now
it features support for nvidia sli
remember they do have to pay for that
badge so extra value add having that
certification for nvidia sli technology
it has reliable performance and here
finally i'll have to tell you what the
CM and what the M is for cable
management so that is their way of
saying that they do have a modular
interface on this particular power
supply why don't we go ahead and start
the unboxing process with the removal of
the plastic shrink wrap around the
outside oh this is Finn's tonneau not to
die yet okay now we will remove the
paper sleeve with all the fancy shiny
graphics and shiny and video logo and
look at that shiny FSP logo it's not
look shiny in the camera excellent glad
to hear it okay next we have the black
box that the power supply itself chips
inside with a few different labeled
compartments so first we have our Quick
Start Guide which is going to tell you
probably pretty much what a power supply
is and why you care yep troubleshooting
installation of the power supply and
what your connectors all are good pretty
basic stuff alright next we have Nate
I'm actually not only for people who
play this is for gamers and workstations
remember any high quality efficient
power supply is going to be suitable for
pretty much any application that needs
high efficiency high quality and quiet
because 80 plus gold gives you a few
different advantages one it means you
draw overall less power from the wall to
it
that you are producing less heat as
waste when you are consuming an
inordinate amount of power from your
power supply whether it's with a
high-end gaming machine or a high-end
workstation and three you are saving the
environment because you are consuming
less power to power your computer now
these are interesting I have never seen
modular cables like this before and I
may never see modular cables like this
again these are very very unique to
those in a minute because those are
those are almost like the highlight of
the show at this point I look cool okay
let's take this out let's leave this up
here let's get rid of those and then we
are finally going to be left with only
the things that are relevant on my cable
here to this our MCM series power supply
so let's start with the cables that are
pre attached from the power supply
itself and those are going to be your
24-pin connector I don't object to this
cable being pre attached some people do
but I think that's just being fussy
because you need it every computer needs
an ATX main connector period so there
you go next we have two PCIe power
connectors these are both six plus 2s
these I also don't object to them being
pre attached because anyone who's buying
a 750 watt power supply probably has a
graphics card okay next we have a four
plus four pin connector and an eight pin
connector I would have preferred to see
one of these attached and the other as
an optional cable simply because most
motherboards only require one of the two
but at least they give you those options
and you can always tie back the extra
one like this in order to hide it in
your case the modular interface is right
here so it looks like we've got four
peripheral modular cable slots and then
one eight pin that would be for an
additional two PCIe 6 plus two pin
connectors which are likely there as a
modular cable and we'll get to those in
just a moment let's have a look at the
rest of the unit itself this is my
personal favorite paint finish I don't
know if I
or said that in a video before on the
past but in my silverstone tjo seven
I've actually had this paint finish with
mountain mods they call it or they used
to call it anyway they call it black
wrinkle and it's kind of a textured
powder coat finish that is extremely
fingerprint resistant extremely scratch
resistant and I think it looks just
great
I hope the light is catching it okay but
you can see how it has kind of a
different look to it if you look at it
from a different angle the way it
catches the light just just love it it's
a matte finish but it has kind of a
shininess to it you can see there's an
FSP logo there it's going to look just
great in any case all right on the back
we have a power switch we have our power
plug and they have kind of a unique
arrows type design for the air flow
that's coming out of the back of the
unit I mean it's just it doesn't really
matter it just looks kind of neat okay
and then finally we have a 120
millimeter fan in the bottom or top of
the power supply depending on how you
choose to mount it so you put it in this
way it's on the top you put it in that
way it's on the bottom it's going to
depend on whether your case has
ventilation through the bottom of the
case for the fan itself all right let's
put the power supply down for a minute
and let's have a look at these here
cables these are awesome okay so as I
suspected these are for peripherals so
this guy right here is a woo we have one
to save the cables to molex cables and
one floppy connector all on one cable so
you can see about how long it is it
looks like it's probably about 3 feet
long 3 and a half feet long
okay next we have 2 SATA connectors and
2 molex connectors so these first two
are SATA and these next two are molex ok
next we have dual molex so rather a 1
SATA and one molex sorry and finally out
nope not finally not just yet oh we have
three SATA that's good I was looking for
one native dedicated SATA cable and
that's really good to see because this
is great for cable management you throw
this one over we're all
hard drives are you take one of these
combo say that and molex ones you throw
that up to your optical drive there's
you say that and then you run your molex
around behind your motherboard tray to
plug in your fans or whatever else the
case may be and all of a sudden this
modular power supply makes a lot more
sense to me now that I've seen that we
have one dedicated SATA cable and
finally we have that a pin to dual six
plus two pin power connectors so that
means you can install your second
high-end graphics card in nvidia sli
mode so now let's have a look at these
cables themselves so check this out okay
so if that works basically we've got all
of our cables we've got some heat-shrink
and then we have everything laid flat
inside what appears to be almost like a
like a thicker heat shrink there you go
so this will be awesome for cable
management because look how thin that is
that's like here I'll bring out my
iPhone for comparison so you guys can
see but if you're running this behind
your drive cages or behind your
motherboard tray even if you don't have
a great high-end case that has a ton of
room for managing cables behind it I
mean I would almost take this some the
the native PCIe connectors and just tie
them away somewhere and I would run this
up to my single graphics card if I was
only running one graphics card because
you're going to be able to manage it so
well actually I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
the our MCM series Gold 750 M not what
that is m4 modular or cable management
it actually comes with three velcro ties
three more other more different velcro
ties okay so these ones actually these
are super handy I use these on my test
bench all the time just run them through
their time up velcro okay and finally a
sticker that says powered by a power bi
FSP and last but not least four thumb
screws for plugging the power supply
into your case
Jack neon by unboxing don't forget to
subscribe flatus tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos
sorry guys couple more notes here that I
didn't mention before this is a quad
rail power supply with each rail capable
of providing up to 18 amps and the
twelve little rails themselves are
capable of providing almost the entire
capacity of this power supply so that's
good because most modern systems are
very 12 volt rail dependent we've also
got all of the Japanese made capacitors
are rated for up to 105 degrees Celsius
this is critical because if you're using
capacitors that are rated at whatever
they're rated at but only at 30 degrees
Celsius forty degrees Celsius those are
lower rated capacities or capacitors
than ones that are rated for that
performance at a high temperature so it
means no matter what happens with this
power supply it will actually perform
according to its specification quiet and
durable cooling yeah they mentioned that
the the 120 ml fan is a fluid dynamic
bearing fan that makes a big difference
it will be quieter and finally to last
but not least oh that's kind of neat FSP
his own patented icy design allows you
to it allows it to make continuous
adjustments according to the output load
in order to achieve the best possible
efficiency so it's neat so they've
actually got their own custom chipset in
this particular power supply that's
going to optimize the efficiency
according to what kind of loads you're
pulling through it so there now I'm done</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
