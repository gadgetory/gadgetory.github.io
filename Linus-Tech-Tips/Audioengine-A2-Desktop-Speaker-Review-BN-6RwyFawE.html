speaker reviews and this is one that I
have been asked to look at many many
times or at least the older revision the
audio engine a two pluses are the
follow-up to the older revision the
extremely popular audio engine a tooth
and I have to say I was really excited
to take them for a test drive the
Corsair Flash Voyager go is the easy way
to move photos music and videos between
your Android device and your PC click
now to learn more so let's start with
what they are the a2 plus is a powered
2.0 speaker setup that relies on quality
MDF construction with each speaker
equipped with a 3/4 inch silk dome
tweeter and 2.75 inch custom Kevlar
woofer the left speaker contains the
business end of things we have power in
an analog input as well as a USB input
enabled by the now included DAC that's
an improvement over the previous a 2 a
coaxial audio output that allows music
to be sent wirelessly to other speakers
with an optional adapter or a subwoofer
to be added to the system a 2 wire
output to the right speaker and finally
I really can't figure out why they put
this here a rear mounted volume knob at
the front you find the speakers I
mentioned before as well as a base port
that is the only real trick at the a 2
pluses sleeve in terms of reproducing
low-frequency sounds since it doesn't
resort to using any digital signal
processing or fake bass boost circuits
something that will comment on more
later but let's move on to who these are
for well at 250 bucks they're solidly
constructed but not cheap so they seem
to be targeted at folks who are willing
to pay a premium for well-built
no-nonsense products that deliver a
tangible performance improvement over
cheaper solutions but who also don't
want to get sucked into the hype train
of snake-oil nonsense that exists around
many audiophile grade products sounds
like a recipe for success
reddit forums and other online
communities will often rally around just
such a bang for the buck product and
from my casual observation that does
seem to be where a law
audio engines pain comes from on the
subject of bang for the buck they get
reasonably loud louder than the Bowers
and Wilkins nm ones for sure but at half
the price of most of the other products
in this review series I'm not expecting
them to blow the roof off of my house
and they don't in fact I'd say in terms
of maximum volume they're not crank it
so loud it hurts speakers where you're
really going to feel the explosions in
your favorite action games and movies
but they would be suitable for ambient
music at a cocktail party if you were to
try and use them as room speakers as
long as you can convince your guests to
party reasonably quietly another thing
that they're not is studio monitors
although audio engine site does make a
point of mentioning their studio monitor
like design philosophy durability and
you know quality and all that stuff so
don't be surprised if you end up with
something that might not be a studio
monitor but might be tuned a little bit
differently than your typical you know
beats by dre type of sound signature now
speaking of non flat sound signatures
the bottom line for me doing my
listening tests with my usual mix of top
40 music Captain America and titanfall
games dreams is that the a 2 pluses did
not meet my expectations and I actually
found them to be fairly anemic sounding
yes I come in expecting them to have a
more flat reference sound signature but
I was still a little bit surprised taken
aback at how unexcited they were to
listen to given that they're half of the
price of 2.0 competitors like the simple
audio listen and Bowers and Wilkins mm
ones they start to look more compelling
because they're certainly better than a
you know 29.99 plastic speaker set from
a gaming brand but however natural
sounding the bass might be versus the
weird one-dimensional sounding bass that
I described in my mm1 review and as
objectively better a solution it is to
not use software tricks to play around
with the way the speaker's sound
I just didn't mind the a2 pluses that
enjoyable to listen to they get
surprisingly loud for their size yes but
it just feels empty compared to the
system's with these boosting tricks or
subwoofers and however much the purists
might hate me for saying it I prefer
those solutions in a side
by side listening test it's not all bad
news though expandability for the future
is something to consider B&amp;amp;W SMM ones do
not offer any subwoofer connection so
you're stuck with them the way they are
and many prepackaged speaker sets like
Corsairs SP 2500 s use proprietary
cables and connectors so while they do
come with a sub they aren't easily
disconnected from it and connected to
other gear in a modular fashion not so
with these puppies hooking up a sub does
wonders for the a2 plus and the audio
engine s8 subwoofer is a great match for
them
it helps provide the rumble that
multimedia freaks will want and while
you'll be spending about $100 more than
the listens of the mm ones aside from
the mm one's clear superiority at the
high end this combo will actually give
you a very well rounded overall
experience but they still don't get my
recommendation because even with the
subwoofer they feel like an eye
compromised to save space or to save
money solution the enclosures however
well engineered they're reinforced MDF
construction with rounded corners might
be simply don't seem big enough to
deliver the same kick in the mids or the
lows that they're bigger and not that
much more expensive in the grand scheme
of things brothers in the a5 plus 2 so
that's what you're left with if you want
to shop all audio engine not an unusual
thing given the reputation 250 bucks
with no subwoofer and not a lot of fun
to listen to in this reviewers opinion
$600 with an S eight sub woofer or
there's a third option in between that I
really think takes the cake
but you'll have to wait for my full
review of the audio engine a 5 plus to
get the complete picture
don't worry I'll try to get it done soon
