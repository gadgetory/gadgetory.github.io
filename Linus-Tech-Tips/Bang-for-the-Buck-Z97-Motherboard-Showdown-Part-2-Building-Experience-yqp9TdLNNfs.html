100 ish dollars ed 97 motherboard
showdown as you know from the last video
we normally focus on badass top 2 your
mother boards which are uncommon in the
real world and as we've demonstrated in
the past don't really impact performance
in a positive or negative way so this
series will focus on the more sensible
affordable motherboards which most
people will actually be buying and we're
going to explore their pros cons and
trade-offs in this episode we will be
covering the experience of building a
computer with these motherboards things
like PCI layout fan header and plug
positioning when installing into a case
accessories and even color selection
will be covered and videos for stuff
like BIOS usability and finish system
experience will be coming after CES so
stay tuned
the Coolermaster Neptune 240m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive
near-silent performance click now to
learn more one thing on weatherboards
that gets a lot of attention is the
PCI's layout even people that I've built
for in the past have been overly worried
about the future proof aspect of PCI
layout despite them having no real
intention of adding more than one GPU or
any other card for that matter to their
system so for most people it is unlikely
to make a difference but it's still
worth considering just in case the top
two slots and the bottom three slots on
these boards are all identical and those
will be the most u slots anyways because
even when someone does decide to add
more cards they're unlikely to use the
ones in the middle that did vary
somewhat because of their proximity to
the top PCIe 16x slot which will render
one useless with any dual graphics card
setup and the other not recommended to
give after mentioned cards some
breathing room the fan headers however
are of much greater importance if you
want to take advantage of the fan speed
control that's built into your
motherboards many if not all of these
headers can be used in a normal system
and there
position can make or break the
appearance of your cable management
every board accommodated having a rear
case fan but after that they varied
quite heavily gigabyte had a pretty
balanced setup overall although only
having two headers near the top may
limit your selection of a i/o cooler
slightly if the pump must be powered by
a fan header asrock had the most
included fan headers at 6 but the
positioning of them while quite good for
an air cooler will no doubt be
frustrating for anyone who wants to
install a liquid cooling system in the
top of their case as none of the fan
headers are at the top of the board and
only some of them were actually 4 pin
pwm headers a sous slacked quantity with
only 4 available fan headers but at
least the layout was fairly balanced and
MSI had in my opinion the best layout of
all of them with header spread out all
around the board giving you the
versatility to play around a little bit
with the placement of your setup
something to note is that the
positioning in general here is the key
point not amount of headers don't forget
you can mostly fix availability issues
with inexpensive splitters onto other
connectors luckily for the PC building
community motherboard manufacturers seem
to have come to a good old consensus
when it comes to positioning of standard
CPU and motherboard power and standard
case headers we've passed the dark ages
of randomly placed headers halfway up
your freaking motherboard and 24 pin or
8 pin power plugs randomly placed where
they really really shouldn't be for the
sake of system airflow I like right
angle sockets for SATA but not all cases
allow the stiff USB 3.0 front panel
cable to be installed this way so I
understand why most boards offer a non
angled socket but I must say I really
like MSI's implementation with two
sockets one angled and one normal
because even though very few cases
actually have 4 USB 3.0 ports this gives
you the flexibility to even either have
tidier cable management or better
compatibility as for the rest of the
headers USB 2.0 front panel audio and
front switches Asus gigabyte asrock all
had varying degrees of good enough
labeling but MSI's front panel switches
labeling was kind of off in the middle
of nowhere which was a little bit
annoying - they kind of find and could
be first
waiting for some people a Seuss Emma
sighing gigabyte all featured some
degree of plastic guard around their
headers which can help you not screw up
when tediously plugging in all your
various headers but the Azeroth board
did not feature any of these but not a
huge deal the accessories included with
these boards were essentially all the
same standard fare you'd expect on a
value board exactly what you need with
no flashing LED displays and OC brackets
or any of that kind of stuff
each included a user guide of some sort
an i/o shield two SATA cables one driver
disk and every board except for MSI
included a case badge with gigabyte and
asrock also giving you an sli bridge as
they support that feature in terms of
colors every board had an unfortunate
shade of brown for their PCB except for
as rock and as rock gigabyte in MSI all
went with fairly standard blue or red
color scheme with a soos deciding to be
a hero and go with gold I get it they're
trying to communicate their whole we are
the gold standard motherboards thing but
personally I would prefer a propaganda
sticker on the box instead of tacky gold
on my motherboard although if you want
to go for that Iron Man look matching it
with some red components may work out
for you all one of you who's ever going
to do that mr. Downey jr. in summary
this video is about the importance of
paying attention to how all your
components will work together instead of
just how many raw features each one of
them has individually thanks to
standardization your case will probably
determine how well your cable runs work
more than your motherboard your cooler
will probably determine what fan header
layout is best for you and your desired
color scheme also the colors of the rest
of your components in all likelihood
will probably determine what color you
want your motherboard cooling heat sinks
to be so the moral of the story is to
plan for what you will actually use and
not to overspend based on what you think
you might possibly use in four to five
years when you'll probably be replacing
this board anyways by the way the next
video coming in the series will be the
BIOS usability rundown of all of these
boards which will also be very important
so stay tuned for that
guys in the comments down below let me
know what you think is important about
motherboards and in the finished system
experience and BIOS usability videos let
me know what you guys want to see again
comments down below or on the forum
while you're commenting down below or
before you leave to the forum be sure to
like or dislike this video depending on
how you like the fact that we're doing
kind of lower end motherboards and we
normally do share the video if you think
it's good and subscribe to the channel
if you have not already over on the
forum if you don't like the ads on the
forum you can become a contributor if
you notice that new office campaign
banner at the top that will soon be
going away for those of you that don't
like it for those of you that might be
interested click on that you'll see how
the new office campaign is doing also in
the description below this video you can
check to see any shirts if you're
interested in buying one of our cool
shirts like keep on diggin I think
that's still going and if you jump back
over to the forum again one last time
there should be a support us kind of box
chill in there if you click on that
it'll show you different ways to change
your Amazon affiliate codes and stuff
like that so you can support us in other
ways
thank you guys a ton for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
