iBUYPOWER suite and they've actually got
something pretty cool on display that I
wanted to show you guys so this is the
Erebus they've got a video playing
behind me on sort of a makeshift
projector screen
there's no some of the cool features but
since we have the benefit of having one
here in person we can actually just
check out what's going on right down and
dirty in the system so here we have okay
I'm bear with me here because this is
gonna take a while it's a very high
number we have one two three four
radiators in the system so that is three
dual rads and 1 quadruple rad up in the
top of the system so they have
completely over built this case in terms
of the water cooling potential that it
can handle now not only can you mount
all those radiators but you have tons of
room for whatever other hardware you
could possibly want to throw at it so
for one thing you can handle a very long
power supply okay for the next thing you
can handle up to up to six hard drives
and I'm gonna go ahead and assume that
like their other sliding rails these are
two and a half inch ready and if someone
can this is a very early prototype so
I'm just gonna go ahead yeah there's a
mounting hole there so we've got no
problems they're up to four five and a
quarter inch base so this is gonna be
designed for system integration which
means that a lot of those customers are
gonna want not only a reader and a
writer but maybe also a fan controller
and since you don't have to worry about
how to hook all that stuff up their
technicians are gonna do it for you then
I have I have no problem with seeing
that number five and a quarter inch base
on a case like this because they can
make sure that that's all taken care of
we've got a very high end completely
custom cooling solution here so we're
running coolants radiators cool ads
quick connects we've got a Lang pump so
they've really gone a step beyond using
cookie cutter water cooling components
they're using the ones that are actually
designed to last a long time Lang pumps
are number one pretty much I have a leg
pump running in my system I've had for
over three years non-stop and there are
countless countless stories like that
this is actually the d5 I believe what
else do we have here to talk about so we
got some air
fans which falls in line with the color
scheme that they're using you've got I
actually don't know what motherboard
this is but it looks like one of the one
two three four five six literally seven
expansion slots and that particular
board although oh no no yep this is
their this is the UD seven so this is an
x58 motherboard so we've got support for
triple channel memory core i7 extreme
six core processors and they've not only
water-cooled so let's look at everything
we've water-cooled in this system the
CPU and three graphics cards in 3-way
SLI but they've also water cooling
cooled the MOSFETs on this board and
they are using an ek water block for
that - like I said fully custom fully
awesome components not nothing that's
off the shelf and then what are we using
it looks like we're using coolant blocks
on the GPUs now you've got this is a
full cover motherboard water blocks so
you've got not only the MOSFETs cool but
also the Northbridge and the self bridge
if you want to come down here and look
right down there you can actually see
that it is almost completely covered in
liquid cooled metal we're using
compression fittings which I am a big
fan of because it's very very difficult
to lose your seal of compression fitting
even over time and they're using 90
degree fittings in order to really keep
and even some 45 degree fittings that's
that's a nice touch down there to keep
the tubing flow from from kinking and
keep from having any issues with that
particular aspect of it so thank you to
my makeshift cameraman here so that I
can show you the Erebus and don't forget
