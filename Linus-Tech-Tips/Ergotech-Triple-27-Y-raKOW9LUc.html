monitor desk stand with telescoping
wings comes in about the most unassuming
brown packaging that I've ever seen once
you get inside everything is well
protected in bubble wrap but frankly
since it's made of almost entirely solid
metal even if it wasn't protected in
bubble wrap it would probably arrive
functional anyway with its factory
tuning and data center DNA and Intel 730
series SSD is an amazing choice for
gamers and performance enthusiasts
taking everything out of the box it
looks a little bit intimidating but the
install process was actually finished in
less than 15 minutes simply screw the
shaft into the base then tighten the
screw at the back with the included
allen key slide the triple monitor arm
over the top of the shaft then tighten
the little Vice style handle until it
doesn't move anymore make sure you put
this at the height that you want it now
you will need to remove at least some of
your monitors if you want to adjust it
later now it's time for the monitors any
monitors can work as long as they fit on
the stand and have for evasive
compatible mounting holes at the back
the non telescoping version can handle
up to three 24-inch monitors while the
telescoping version that I had can
handle up to 325 pound 27 inch monitors
I'll be using two PB 278 Q's on the
sides and a PA 279 Q in the middle so
just take them off their stock stands
and these ones come off with four screws
then put the included screws somewhere
safe lay the monitors flat on a safe
surface and mount the included
quick-release pivots to the back of them
you may notice that two of the
quick-release pivots in the box are
different from the third use these ones
for the outside monitors because they
have a knob that allows the height of
the connected display to be adjusted
slightly to compensate in case the rear
arm or your desk or whatever else isn't
quite level once that's done fold the
stands arms out straight and simply hook
the pivots onto the back arm they lock
into place and can only be removed if
you lift up the little pin on the top
these pivots are actually where all the
magic happens here they can be tilted up
and down swivel left
right and even pivoted to portrait mode
going either way gives you a lot of
options for adjustment I didn't need to
change it but if you want you can also
use the included larger allen key to
adjust the tension on them to make it
easier or harder to move your monitors
around once all the monitors are in
place bend the back arm to the correct
angle so whatever will be most suitable
for your desired sitting position make
any last-minute adjustments then run all
the cables across the arm and down the
back with the cable management clip for
an extremely clean looking desk now I
haven't set up a triple monitor gaming
rig only once before with 324 inches and
an XFX Eyefinity stand I'd say the
biggest difference this time around was
ease of use everything went together so
quickly and so easily that compared to
before I'd be much more likely to
recommend this another thing that I
liked was the large flat metal base its
size gives the whole apparatus enough
stability that even with just two
monitors attached say while you're
putting it together it won't fall over
and even though it actually takes up
almost as much desk space as three
normal monitor stands because it's so
low profile you can easily put stuff on
it so you end up with a lot more usable
room on your desk with that said it's
not perfect so my biggest complaint I
guess is that well they say it can
handle 27-inch monitors it barely does
it if I stripped the bezels off
something I wouldn't mind doing as a
crazy project sometime it would be fine
but with the bezels on the telescoping
arms needed to be fully extended and I
had to have the pivots hanging off the
end a little bit to get the angle that I
wanted I guess that's about it I mean
the price is solid considering what
competing products go for and how
well-built this is and the fact that
it's upgradable is a big bonus that last
bit was actually a pro tip from the guy
who runs widescreen gaming forum if you
don't buy a telescoping triple stand in
the first place you can add telescoping
arms for larger monitor support you can
add an additional monitor up top for a
three plus one config or even go full-on
crazy and
like a six panel setup the sky's the
limit the this modularity is actually
what allowed the widescreen gaming forum
folks to have their own edition of the
product that use a solid aluminum
throughout making it a bit more premium
feeling they reached out to me about
reviewing that one but the timing was
funny I told them that I already had
this one in the review queue so this is
the one you guys are getting a video of
but if you're considering buying
something like this you might want to
check out the widescreen gaming forum
one as well it's great form over there
if you're looking for tips and tricks on
how to make your games work in weird
aspect ratios particularly wide ones
it's definitely a good place to go
anyway that's pretty much it I guess if
I had to come up with another complaint
about this set up it would be a
self-imposed one and that's that at
about 11 megapixels this setup is almost
30 percent more difficult for your PC to
drive than even a 4k monitor so you're
gonna need to gather up as much GPU
horsepower and video REM as you can if
you want to stand a chance of playing
computer games at this res but if you're
one of those people who's into the whole
surround gaming experience and you know
who you are
then you probably know what a blissful
gaming experience it is at this kind of
a res and at this kind of a size once
you get it up and running unlike
anything else is only the beginning of
how I would describe it oh and I guess
the stand comes with a lifetime warranty
too so that's uh yet another thing that
I didn't say before guys thanks for
watching this video like it if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it leave a
