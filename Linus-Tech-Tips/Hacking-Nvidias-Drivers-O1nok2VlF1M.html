so this is our mining GPU that we're
using for gaming in spite of its
complete lack of any video outputs but
you've seen this before and the last
time we left you guys
we weren't recommending these things
even though they're like 75 bucks for
the equivalent of a GTX 1060 because the
only drivers we had for them were
modified by some Chinese driver
modification team and we had no way of
knowing exactly what was inside them but
today all of that changes first and
foremost we are going to manually modify
and videos drivers ourselves making this
completely safe to use second while
we're at it we're gonna kill in videos
telemetry that they build into their
drivers and third we are gonna run this
in SLI with one of these which is like
what what running a real gaming GPU with
a mining one in SLI they're not even the
same part number oh ed while we're at it
the ten sixty doesn't even support SLI
but we're gonna do it and you know what
else we're gonna do
tell you about our sponsor last way with
glass wire you can instantly see your
current and past network activity you
can detect malware and block badly
behaving apps on your PC or Android
device and you can get it for 25% off at
the link in the video description with
offer code -
okay so here's the situation right now
we're not quite starting from scratch
but pretty close
so we've already disabled driver signing
and you can see how to do that in our
previous video here where we use the the
modified Chinese driver but other than
that we're looking at a pretty bone
stock configuration here so our P 106
mining GPU is installed in our system
but the drivers for it are not loaded in
any way we're in a in a completely blank
state and we are running entirely off of
the onboard graphics that are built into
our CPU here so Anthony's back hi before
we go any further I want to lay out what
our ideal scenario would be here because
in our last video we weren't just
relying on a driver of unknown origins
it was also a little bit on the older
side so in a perfect world we would want
our p 106 mining card here to behave
exactly like a dt x 1060 because
hardware wise they're the same thing
so that means gaining support compute
support and even n banc video encoding
support and all of that while being able
to run the very latest drivers however
we've run into some challenges and we
are gonna have to make a few compromises
here so what do we got well first of all
we won't be able to run on the latest
drive or at least not right now the way
it works right now and we're just
getting a code 43 error every time so
either nvidia has changed something or
they patched it or whatever either way
we're stuck with for 16 point 34 aside
from that as far as I know it's not
possible to get anything to work so so
you're stuck with quick sync which
fortunately you're gonna have to have
because you're running your onboard
graphics anyway in order to even get a
display output from this thing or x264
so with that out of the way Anthony's
going to start by downloading our own
fresh version of that 416 series driver
and then taking the Chinese one and the
Nvidia one and comparing what the
difference is between them so that we
can replicate the modifications that the
Chinese team has made
that allows the driver to be installed
without copying over anything that could
be nefariously hidden inside it so I'm
using notepad plus plus and the reason
for that is it's free it's pretty great
actually it's got a huge and of our
features including this compare feature
which we can access via this plugins
section here we just type in compare and
I've already installed it so it's in
here but yeah once you have that just go
to you load up your first file go to
plugins compare set as first to compare
I've already done that
now I will load up the other one which
is this Chinese driver plugins compare
compare so here we have a full listing
of everything that is different between
these two drivers so as we can see these
lines here have been modified so where
it used to say section 110 it now says
section 108 which is actually the same
if you look at these device IDs once e06
is actually the gtx 1060 1c0 seven is
our p 106 they have different sections
in the vanilla driver but in the chinese
driver they do not that is the primary
thing we're going to be changing here
okay now the final one of these sections
here we'll notice that it actually says
that it's 109 instead of 110 it's
dropped down a number the same is true
over here so we'll just follow here so
it'll be 107 Creech basically what we're
doing is we're copying the same config
from our 1c 0 6 which is our GTX 1060 so
we want section 1 0 7 for all of these
things now what we're doing here is
basically just tricking the driver into
thinking it's compatible we're not
actually changing any of the functional
files of the driver installation is that
correct
that's right and if we go down through
the rest of the comparison here there is
nothing different really so then it's
possible that our Chinese driver was
totally clean yeah possible but I mean
we don't know about the exe s the INF is
perfectly fine we can make some
additional changes while we're here
though telemetry isn't it convenient
that they just listed under env
telemetry yeah for those not familiar
telemetry is a feature of a software or
driver that reports back on your usage
to the manufacturer and a lot of the
time this is stuff that you can opt out
of but a lot of the time it's just baked
right in so there you go we
asked our compatibility check yep let's
go ahead and install it of course we do
not want GeForce experience also don't
care about 3d vision because we don't
actually have anything that we can
connect it to and hopefully we will get
the same exact thing we got the other
day but we did it for ourselves on a
fresh driver hey there we go alright so
that's it if nothing else we now can say
confidently that if you pick up one of
these mining cards and use this method
on this particular driver you will be
able to play games mmm yeah that that
monitor doesn't really have a shield on
its yeah the biggest criticism we had
last time is that we didn't actually
show the Intel integrated and how poorly
that perform oh really yeah oh it would
be worse than this a lot worse yeah this
is Deus Ex mankind divided running at
1080p at greater than 8 frames per
second so it's working now the thing is
even though we're having trouble moving
on to the latest drivers which would
give us support for things like oh I
mean I guess freesync doesn't matter
because you'd be you could actually have
freesync running off of Intel's onboard
graphics yeah you could never mind
depending on whether or not your onboard
graphics supports reason okay but still
there are good reasons to be running the
latest drivers now we're not saying it's
impossible we're just saying that when
we applied this same method to the
latest drivers even checking line by
line we weren't successful so it might
just be down to people who are a little
bit better versed in their driver
modification and Wizardry to figure out
what the additional things that nvidia
has changed whether just through the
course of changing things to make them
better or to specifically block this in
order to make that work either way at
the very least using a slightly older
driver we have a working gaming system
on the cheap but
that's not where we stop today for our
next trick we're gonna run this thing in
SLI now we're still gonna have to deal
with that same driver compatibility
limitation because one of the cards in
our system is one of these P 106 mining
cards but what it at least demonstrates
is that from a proof-of-concept
standpoint this can work
so you might think that this process is
as simple as throwing a real gtx 1060
into the system and then again forcing
our driver to install remember it's an
unsigned driver now so you got to do
that process manually but as we're about
to discover it did not it did not oh hi
mark
whatever the point is there's no SLI
option here whatsoever so now what some
kind of weird thing off the tech powerup
forum yeah what are we doing so it's a
program called different sli auto it's
currently in the downloads folder but
you guys will have the download and
extract that for yourselves and we don't
actually want to run the program
okay that would be too easy yes it used
to work but it doesn't anymore so no so
you'll want to go to see windows
system32 driver store and now we want to
sort it by date we want to copy the NBL
DD and it's the driver itself yeah I
couldn't find it earlier either okay
just in a sea of env pasted into the
different sli auto folder now you'll
want to open up in hex editor I
downloaded hxd it's free
should be there on the desktop you got
it you want to search for the strip for
the string of values seven five zero
five zero f ba oh I already had it there
okay cool there it is so we want to
change that so you'll want to go to the
beginning of that and type in yeah C
seven four three two four zero zero zero
zero two zero zero zero zero the hard
part's over okay so we want to go back
to the folder you got that driver from
we want to take the folder name itself
copy that and this is probably also
already Auto populated but if you go
back to the different sli auto folder
right click and install that CMD go to
edit see where it says the env design
apps that
up there you want to replace that in
every sin every instance so you can use
the replace function in notepad for that
yeah all right so then we want to
restart into safe mode oh lordy okay so
that work yeah sure all right next
you're going to want to go into that
holder again different sli auto and run
install that CMD as a minister well I
guess it's the same thing and it's a
funny way you know what let's just do it
okay
boom reboot now for changes to take
effect yep
so what have we done here sign the
driver really supposedly it doesn't
actually work okay that's something that
we can do though something that requires
a lot more but Singh around that we
don't really want to do right now it
does that copies the modified driver
that we change the bits around in yeah
to the proper locations in Windows yeah
and well that's really about it and then
just to clarify for the viewers out
there changing those hex values have we
done anything unsafe to our system have
we potentially compromised it not
compromised no but who told us to change
those values well it's actually a guy on
the tech power up forums okay by the
name of pretentious yeah there we go
that's the name yeah he's got a little
script that he runs that takes about an
hour or two to find where exactly the
string that we found yeah is in each
driver release and he just updates it on
the forum it's pretty great basically
what it does yeah is it disables the
check for SLI as far as motherboard
compatibility and you know the inter GPU
compatibility so to be clear you guys
aren't gonna be running in RTX 28 ET i
and a gtx 1030 in sli at least not to
any positive effect but over here in a
case where we have two GPUs that we know
are identical other than nvidia deciding
they're not our expectation is that we
would actually be able to achieve an
improvement in performance so here it is
the sli option is there in the driver
we're gonna go ahead and enable it and
bippity floppity
No Oh
keyboard light just went off as it turns
out that SLI mod will not work with the
peep 106
unfortunately whatever maybe it's the
fact that it doesn't have outputs maybe
it's the fact that they have two
different Levi offices that are you know
for whatever reason right now does not
work if we could force the card to take
a different B by us that might work but
I haven't medial to get that to work
either I mean we can still run gtx 1060
s in sli I guess that's still fun all
right so what we've done here is we've
manually installed our driver again
moved our HDMI cable over to this GPU
and we're gonna go ahead and enable our
other device which got automatically
disabled somewhere along the way it's
kind of like a precautionary measure Hey
SLI enabled on the gtx 1060 where's my
deus ex at now beaches I'm actually not
sure what the skins would be like here
now the thing here is that there's
nothing particularly amazing about
running graphics cards in a multi GPU
configuration without a bridge running
between them in fact AMD has been doing
it this way for several generations now
NVIDIA though has stuck to their guns
saying that the available bandwidth over
the PCI Express slots is not enough to
handle the inter card communication and
has even gone as far as to upgrade the
original sli link to the new envy link
standard that you'll see on there our TX
cards with that said even though we
won't be able to speak to necessarily
you know micro stuttering and how this
solution effects something like that we
can see if we could at least get an FPS
improvement with this configuration and
we'll know pretty shortly here yeah a
benchmark only takes 90 seconds hey wow
that's a pretty nice little improvement
there isn't it yeah so once again our
experimenting with Nvidia graphics cards
video does come with some caveats this
isn't necessarily a configuration we'd
recommend SLI is in most cases not as
good an option as simply getting a
single higher powered graphics card so I
don't even know
necessarily disagree with Nvidia
disabling SLI by default on their lower
end cards it's just something that was
kind of fun to do and interesting to
show you guys just how simple it is for
manufacturers to lock down and or enable
functionality at least from a sort of
hex editor perspective now the QC that
would actually go into ensuring that
this would be an adequate solution for
their users that's a completely separate
story and maybe part of the reason that
manufacturers won't allow functionality
that they otherwise could but I'll let
you guys be the judge of exactly why it
is that this is locked out you guys can
