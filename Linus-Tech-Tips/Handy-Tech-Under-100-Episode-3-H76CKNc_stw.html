DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts welcome to handy
tech under $100 episode 3 where I give
very brief overviews of gizmos gadgets
and gear that I or someone in the lines
tek-tips crew here has been using lately
and has been coming in handy for us so
first up is something that I should have
gotten a long time ago these things are
only a few bucks and if you've ever lost
like one screw one screw while working
on something like a notebook or a phone
where it's basically impossible to
replace them once they're gone then you
owe yourself one of these I actually
picked up two different kinds of
magnetic parts trays the first one is
the aptly named titan magnetic parts
tray and the second is the essentially
named Tecton nine-inch magnetic parts
tray it keeps your nuts and small tools
Within Reach
it sounds less like parts tray and more
like partay know what I'm saying
anyway functionally they're both pretty
similar you put metal objects in them
that is to say metal objects containing
iron nickel or cobalt and they well most
of them okay that's not actually how
that doesn't have iron in it and they
stick so you don't lose them
they've got sweet rubber bases on them
so they don't move around on the table
while you're working and in case you
want them to be really secure the bottom
is magnetic too so you can actually
stick the entire thing to a vertical
metal surface if you want to I've only
had them for a little while but they've
already saved my bacon a couple of times
even once when I forgot to use it and
had to pick up some screws that I had
already dropped on the carpet just go
like this
I love these things number two today is
something that I actually personally
can't use comply brand ear tips are
available in a variety of styles and for
a wide variety of different in your
headphones
they're made of supersoft memory foam
and they completely replaced the cheap
silicone ones that usually come with
your earphones with the goal of
improving comfort outside noise
isolation and sound quality particularly
at the low end where bass is concerned
now I said I can't use them but it's not
because I don't want to or because they
don't work with my old SteelSeries flux
in ear Pro earphones they had all of the
intended effects and I loved them with
my only complaint being that they wear
out faster than the silicone
alternatives and need to be replaced
much more frequently with my Sennheiser
IE 80s the drivers are much larger and
even the smallest comply tips which I
usually find to be about equivalent to
one size up for a silicone tip just
don't fit in my ears well enough for me
to use them properly so the way you're
supposed to use them is you squish them
up insert them into the ear canal and
let them expand for a really nice seal
but I just can't split them enough to
get them to really get in there very
well ads along the other hand swears by
them and he stocks up on them every once
in a while to the point where he just
refuses to use normal ones so check out
their earphone finder pick the series
you like they range in price for my
earphones from about $4 to $6 per pair
of tips and then pick a color you like
and you are good to go item number three
is something that I've had sitting on my
need to make a video about this list for
quite some time now I would have said
not long ago that nothing can really be
done to improve SATA cables not so with
the CP 11 SATA cable silverstone has
solved a fundamental problem with the
way that many motherboards have their
SATA connectors positioned this is a
right angle connector and it's great
because no components will be installed
over top of it this is a regular
connector one that's more frequently
found on small high-end boards and
normal-sized mid-range or low end boards
and the problem with them is that they
can interfere with things like graphics
cards making many of the SATA ports on
your motherboard potentially useless the
CP 11 has a remarkably thin cable for
easy management and a head that is so
low profile that you can actually
populate an entire Bank of plugs
directly under an expansion card so you
can use your motherboard to its full
potential not the kind of thing I
generally make a dedicated video about
but definitely something to keep in mind
next time you're working on a small
form-factor machine and are having
trouble with cable management
speaking of management I was having
trouble figuring out where to put all
the cool t-shirts that I got from being
part of the 5-4 Club so I wore them all
at once as you probably noticed
throughout this video
five-four service is incredibly cool you
sign up in under a minute so you don't
have to worry about shopping anymore
they send you a hundred and twenty
dollars or more worth of clothes every
month and to be a member you only pay
$60 per month
well Linus how do I know they won't send
me something that makes no sense and
doesn't go with the rest of the wardrobe
I'm building from their site great
question
you submit your preferences during the
signup process and your own personal
stylist picks out new clothes for you
every month so you can always look great
without dealing with the vulture I mean
salespeople in traditional clothing
stores sign up for the club today at
bitly slash Linus FFC which is linked in
the video description and you can save
15 bucks on your first month that's a
hundred and twenty dollars worth of
clothing for 45 bucks
give being distressed and well dressed a
shot thanks for watching this third
installment of Handy tech for $100 or
less as usual with these I'll do my full
disclosure bit so I bought the magnetic
screw holders on Amazon because I'm sick
of losing screws while the other two
were sent to me to try out and I didn't
pay for them
the comply tips definitely merited a
mention because Ed's ill has been
harassing me to do a dedicated video of
these since I hired him and they really
are better than the ones that come with
your earphones in all likelihood as for
the SATA cables I ended up doing a video
on these because while I told
Silverstone that go ahead and send them
I'll use them for builds but I'm not
going to do a video they've come in
handy quite a few times for me already
so I figured you know what hey this is
something that's come in handy for me
maybe it'll come in handy for you guys
