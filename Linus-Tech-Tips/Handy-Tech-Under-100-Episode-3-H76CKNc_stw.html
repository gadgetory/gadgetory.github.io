welcome to handy tech under $100 episode
3 where I give very brief overviews of
gizmos gadgets and gear that I or
someone in the Linus tech tips crew here
has been using lately and has been
coming in handy for us so first up is
something that I should have gotten a
long time ago these things are only a
few bucks and if you've ever lost like
one screw one screw while working on
something like a notebook or a phone
where it's basically impossible to
replace them once they're gone then you
owe yourself one of these I actually
picked up two different kinds of
magnetic parts trace the first one is
the aptly named titan magnetic part
straight and the second is the
essentially named Tecton nine-inch
magnetic part straight it keeps your
nuts and small tools within reach it
sounds less like parts tray and more
like part a know what I'm saying anyway
functionally they're both pretty similar
you put metal objects in them that is to
say metal objects containing iron nickel
or cobalt and they about most of them
okay that's not actually how that
doesn't have iron in it and they stick
so you don't lose them they've got sweet
rubber bases on them so they don't move
around on the table while you're working
and in case you want them to be really
secure the bottom is magnetic too so you
can actually stick the entire thing to a
vertical metal surface if you want to
I've only had them for a little while
but they've already saved my bacon a
couple of times even once when I forgot
to use it and had to pick up some screws
that I had already dropped on the carpet
just go like this I love these things
number two today is something that I
actually personally can't use comply
brand ear tips are available in a
variety of styles and for a wide variety
of different in ear
headphones they're made of super soft
memory foam and they completely replaced
the cheap silicone ones that usually
come with your earphones with the goal
of improving comfort outside noise
isolation and sound quality particularly
at the low end where bass is concerned
now I said I can't use them but it's not
because I don't want to or because they
don't work with my old SteelSeries flux
in ear Pro earphones they had all of the
intended effects and I loved them with
my only complaint being that they wear
out faster than the silicone
alternatives and need to be replaced
much more frequently with my Sennheiser
IE 80s the drivers are much larger and
even the smallest comply tips which I
usually find to be about equivalent to
one size up for a silicone tip just
don't fit in my ears well enough for me
to use them properly
so the way you're supposed to use them
is you squish them up insert them into
the ear canal and let them expand for a
really nice seal but I just can't squish
them enough to get them to really get in
there very well heads along the other
hand swears by them and he stocks up on
them every once in a while to the point
where he just refuses to use normal ones
so check out their earphone finder pick
the series you like they range in price
for my earphones from about $4 to $6 per
pair of tips and then pick a color you
like and you are good to go item number
3 is something that I've had sitting on
my need to make a video about this list
for quite some time now I would have
said not long ago that nothing can
really be done to improve SATA cables
not so with the CP 11 say the cable
silverstone has solved a fundamental
problem with the way that many
motherboards have their SATA connectors
positioned this is a right angle
connector and it's great because no
components will be installed over top of
it this is a regular connector one
that's more frequently found on small
high-end boards and normal-sized
mid-range or low end boards and the
problem with them is that they can
interfere with things like graphics
cards making many of the SATA ports on
your motherboard potentially useless
the CP 11 has a remarkably thin cable
for easy management and a head that is
so low profile that you can actually
populate an entire bank of plugs
directly under an expansion card so you
can use your motherboard to its full
potential not the kind of thing I
generally make a dedicated video about
but definitely something to keep in mind
next time you're working on a small
form-factor machine and are having
trouble with cable management
speaking of management I was having
trouble figuring out where to put all
the cool t-shirts that I got from being
part of the 5-4 club so I wore them all
at once as you probably noticed
throughout this video
five-four service is incredibly cool you
sign up in under a minute so you don't
have to worry about shopping anymore
they send you a hundred and twenty
dollars or more worth of clothes every
month and to be a member you only pay
$60 per month
well Linus how do I know they won't send
me something that makes no sense and
doesn't go with the rest of the wardrobe
I'm building from their site great
question you submit your preferences
during the signup process and your own
personal stylist picks out new clothes
for you every month so you can always
look great
without dealing with the vulture I mean
salespeople in traditional clothing
stores sign up for the club today at
bitly slash Linus FFC which is linked in
the video description and you can save
15 bucks on your first month that's $120
worth of clothing for 45 bucks you've
being distressed and well dressed a shot
thanks for watching this third
installment of Handy tech for $100 or
less as usual with these I'll do my full
disclosure bit so I bought the magnetic
screw holders on Amazon because I'm sick
of losing screws while the other two
were sent to me to try out and I didn't
pay for them the comply tips definitely
merited a mention because Edsel has been
harassing me to do a dedicated video of
these since I hired him and they really
are better than the ones that come with
your earphones in all likelihood as for
the SATA cables I ended up doing a video
on these because while I told
Silverstone
that go ahead and send them I'll use
them for builds but I'm not going to do
a video they've come in handy quite a
few times for me already so I figured
you know what hey this is something
that's come in handy for me maybe I'll
come in handy for you guys thanks as
always for
watching guys as usual the link to
pricing and availability for all this
stuff is linked in the video description
below the like dislike and share buttons
which I'd love for you to use

description is a support link where you
can buy a t-shirt give us a monthly
contribution or change your amazon
