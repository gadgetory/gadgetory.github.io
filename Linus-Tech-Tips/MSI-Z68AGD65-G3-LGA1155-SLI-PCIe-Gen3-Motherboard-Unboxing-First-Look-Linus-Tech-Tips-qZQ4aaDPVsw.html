motherboard for a couple of different
reasons
number one it is made by MSI whoops here
number two it has a three year warranty
number three it features military class
two with solid ferrite chokes high-seat
caps with tantalum cores and solid caps
for the 10 year lifetime number three
they have added a Better Business Bureau
accredited business sticker to the
outside of the box
so apparently MSI is a Better Business
Bureau accredited business this is
something I did not know number one two
three four number five it features the
world's first PCI Express gen3 support
so that means with a supported CPU you
have support for it double the bandwidth
of PCI Express Gen 2 okay so that means
that a PCIe 3/8 X slot has the same
bandwidth as a PCIe to 16 X slot cool
huh okay also click BIOS 2 has been
implemented on this board so click BIOS
refer to MSI's UEFI Mouse BIOS interface
it has been completely reworked and now
it is click BIOS tooth so hopefully I'll
have a chance to check that out on this
particular board in the near future this
is a certified military standard board
so that's with their military class
components and actually this isn't even
right this board has a 5 year warranty
this sticker is wrong this is an eval
unit from early on it's possible the
decision for 5 year warranty hadn't been
made yet but no this is a 5 year
warranty board along with the GD 80s so
what MSI has decided to do with this
particular military standard board is
stand behind it for an even longer
period of time than they normally do
I've got a couple other cool features
you got your instant OC and the msi
control center software we've got the
supercharger which allows you to charge
an iPad so even a larger device at high
speed even when your PC is shut down and
then we've also got wink III which
allows you to boot up into a pre Windows
OS within the BIOS and do basic things
like browser
the Internet should you so desire all
right we've got a drivers and utilities
DVD a quick installation guide in black
and white we have a top quality and
stability software application user
guide in color on the other side and
black and white on the inside which is
just fine all right we have a rear panel
USB three header so I can plug that into
the on-board header and I can have a
couple extra USB 3 ports if I don't have
front USB three on my case we have an
i/o shield we have the end connectors
which allows me to easily plug in my
front panel connectors without fighting
with the individual little pins against
the board we also have a look at that
we've got that V check so this board
does feature V check which allows you to
check the voltage directly using a
multimeter rather than relying on
software based tools we've got four SATA
cables they are all straight to right
angles and then we have a molex to SATA
adapter I've actually used that on a
number of occasions for the top optical
drive sometimes if you don't want a fee
to say that cable all the way up there
we've also got a mainboard user guide
here and finally an SLI cable so let's
have a look at the board itself and talk
about some of the other features that
are applicable to this board because
this is a z68 for it so besides being
upgraded with support for PCI Express
3.0 it has some cool features all right
z68 board so what that means is you know
what let's start with you know what
let's do the general board layout and
then we'll and then we'll get into the
z68 features so we've got our CPU socket
which is an LGA 1155 socket right here
in the middle of the board around that
we have what's actually a fairly beefy
looking power delivery system you can
see the tantalum core components around
the CPU itself and we've also got a
thick no that's on that note that's a
standard size heat pipe connecting the
cooling for the top of our vrm and the
side vrm all around the CPU socket so
we've got support for core i3 s Core i5
and core i7 CPUs and then we've got our
power up here so we've got
eight pin power connector in its ideal
location along the top left of the board
we have four DDR 3 slots supporting dual
channel operation we have our V check
points this is a great feature because
it allows you to get actually accurate
voltage readouts on the we've got two
grounds ok so we've got the PCH VCC DDR
CPU GFX CPU VT t and VCC P so all those
settings will mean something to you if
you're the kind of person who actually
needs to measure them alright finally
we've got the or not finally you've got
the OC Genie button so that's your
OneTouch overclocking our 24 pin
connectors and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge of the board and
we've got some more fan connectors all
summarized the fan headers after we've
got plenty of SATA ports so we've got
hmm 4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
and 2 SATA our and 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit
per second ports although right now it's
hard for me to tell you guys it looks
like these two are running off the Intel
chipset 4 6 gig per second ports and
these two are probably running off this
Marvell chip site right here but it's
hard to say a hundred percent let me
just see if I can see where those traces
are going yeah yeah that's what it looks
like it looks like those two are running
off the Marvell chipset so moving down
we've got a couple of front USB headers
here this one with red behind it that's
the one that supports the additional
power we've got our USB a 3.0 header
right here and then we've got built-in
reset and power switches here and
finally our front audio header here I
always like to see motherboards with the
maximum number of expansion slots
because that does give you more options
especially if you are installing two
dual slot graphics cards so right here
we have three PCIe 1x slots two PCIe 16x
slots and two PCI slots so if you were
to install two dual slot cards you're
going to be left with a single PCI and
two PCIe 1x which I feel is a good mix
given the state of expansion cards right
now you might have some legacy PCI card
but anything new you're buying you're
probably going to get a PCI Express
version so let's go over how many fan
headers there are on this guy so we've
got one for pin PWM here one for pin
Pete
um here two three pins here and the
three pin here in the middle so that's a
total of five on this motherboard moving
around to the back of the board we have
one two three four USB 2.0 ports one of
those ps2 keyboard mouse combo ports a
clear CMOS button
I love the clear CMOS button on the back
big fan okay we have optical as well as
PO axial audio out HDMI out DVI out and
VGA out giving you an option for what
you want to use if you do use the
onboard video USB three Gigabit Ethernet
and 7.1 audio so this onboard audio
brings us to one of the features and
that is virtue by lucid is a soft so
that's a software that's licensed by
Intel for use on this particular
platform which allows you to use Intel
Quick Sync technology which is built
into the onboard GPU in your CPU the
onboard GPU your CPU the graphics that
are built on to your CPU but use your
dedicated graphics card for gaming and
it will actually help you switch
dynamically between those two different
components when you're doing tasks that
are optimized for them okay the other
feature that is unique to the Zed 68
platform is the ability to use Intel SRT
or Super Smart Response technology which
enables you to use a boot hard drive
such as a one terabyte Western Digital
black or blue for example and remember
don't use a green for boot because it's
not optimized for that and then take an
SSD of 60 gigs or smaller capacity and
use it as a cache for your big hard
drive in order to get up to a four times
performance increase in real world
applications and it does work by the way
in case you guys are wondering this
board is fully SLI and crossfire ready
which is something I haven't mentioned
before and I think that pretty much
covers it thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the world's first PCI
Express 3.0 ready motherboard the z68 a
GD 65 well it's actually the world's
second BAM first because the GD 80
supports the same thing remember to
watch out for the g3 and the part number
in order to make sure that it does
support Gen 3 PCIe graphics and don't
