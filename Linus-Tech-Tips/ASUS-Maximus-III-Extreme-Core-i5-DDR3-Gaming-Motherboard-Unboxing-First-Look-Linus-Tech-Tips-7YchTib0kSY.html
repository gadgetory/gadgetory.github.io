from masseuse this is the latest
conditioner one of the latest two
additions in their republic of gamers
line of motherboards this is the Maximus
three extreme so the other one that's
launching at the same time is the
rampage three extreme which is the x58
version and then this is the p55 version
so that means that it is compatible with
I'm gonna i discarded my remote layer
which was a bad move okay so that means
it is compatible with intel core i7 in
core i5 so those are the Elgin LGA 1156
variants it is sli ready crossfire ready
and let's see what Zeus has to say for
themselves on the back or on the inside
I should say on the motherboard box so
first of all it has rog connect our
energy connect allows you to plug in and
overclocked we get the hardcore way okay
that's not very explanatory i think it's
a little little module though that you
plug into the board okay so USB bios
flash back don't worry about scratching
so rather than having a dual BIOS
feature like their competitors what
they've done is they've actually worked
in a way to just plug in a USB thumb
drive and recover your BIOS that way
clever because then you can cover
whatever recover whatever one you want
extreme engine digi+ this one I've never
heard of say hello to the next
generation designed and then they have a
picture of the CPU socket area so I'm
guessing is something to do with power
delivery ok and then PC bluetooths
overwhelm your acknowledgment with
wireless overclocking experience let me
read that again overwhelm your
acknowledgment with wireless
overclocking experience okay it includes
a copy of 3dmark Vantage as well as a
copy of kaspersky antivirus which may or
may not be a trial version I don't know
alright and then we have a window into
the board itself so you can see that it
has their their typical excellent look
which you always expect from their
republic of gamers line it's always
going to look awesome on the back we
find most of the same information we
found
inside there except for a couple other
things it gives us a big list of specs
and I'm not going to bother to tell you
that and like what concluded because I'm
about to open it up and tell you about
it so let's get this box opened up and
have a look and the board so I'm going
to pull out there's two two boxes inside
here there's two black boxes side by
side so I'm going to pull out the
accessories one first and we'll have a
look at that to start with here alright
so just put the board aside for a minute
and let's see what we find inside the
accessories box we're gonna have to
figure out how to get it open first and
then we'll be good to go Wow lots of
accessories that's the thing about these
high-end boards is you get a nice big
accessory package with them that you
don't typically see on the lower end
models so first of all we have an i/o
shield all right typical looking out
shield it has a Seuss's a fluffy shiny
metal thing on the back alright then we
have a USB cable USB email to a male
then we have a USB and esata bracket
that you can install in your case if you
don't already have those enough of them
at the back then we have the Maximus
three extreme user guide as well as a
couple things okay first of all you've
got the driver CD which also includes a
copy of 3dmark Vantage on it the keys on
the back some of these they're not going
to show you that and then on in here we
have a bunch of stickers to label your
SATA cables so you can label them with
hard drive one hard drive to optical
drive one optical drive to and then you
can write a little descriptive thing for
it that's pretty nice then you've got a
huge republic of gamers k sticker this
thing is enormous there's my hand for
scale so you can throw that on like your
side window if you so desire although
most people probably wouldn't desire but
for those who do desire it is there
that's the thing about you know a big
accessory packages just in case it's
there all right you've got an optional
fan for cooling the MOSFETs next thing
we find is the
I think this is the ROG connect module
or something well maybe this is the
bluetooth thing you know what I don't
know okay next we have a 3-way SLI
bridge looks just like that looks like
any other 3-way SLI bridge so I guess
that die answers that question this
board does have support for 3-way SLI
and then you have just a normal flexible
SLI bridge for two-way SLI they include
a couple of zip ties as well as the
asuste q connect in case you have a
really old chassis that doesn't have the
block of connectors they have included a
wide variety of SATA cables here so
you've got one right angle and one
straight in each of these four packs so
as sous has included eight SATA cables
for you with this board they're black so
they'll look good then you've got three
temperature probes which I'm assuming
you can plug into the board somewhere
and then finally a crossfire bridge so
they've included it looks like a it
might be a little bit longer than a
standard crossfire original though it's
hard to tell cuz I'm doing that off
memory so yeah it's a typical for the
motherboard manufacturer to include a
crossfire bridge but I guess it doesn't
cost them a whole lot because most
manufacturers actually includes the
crossfire bridge with the with the video
card not yet the motherboard so I mean I
guess the last thing they want you to do
is buy a Maximus three extreme you know
high-end motherboard for your build and
you know not have some part that you're
going to need to put together your
computer so a sous has kind of thought
of everything on this one let's get the
motherboard itself out of the box here
just taking off the plastic cover and I
remember having a bit of trouble getting
a motherboard out of one of these
Republican gamers boxes of something and
it's gonna bend it just right yeah I got
to figure it out this time alright so
let's have a look at the board layout
itself so this is a p55 board so that
means you're going to find an LGA 1156
socket so it means you've got support
for core i3 to i5 core i7 something to
note about any core i3 s or Core i5 dual
courses that you are not going to have
support for the onboard video built-in
because there's no onboard video ports
on the back of the board the p55 chipset
does not support
that particular feature where as the age
55 and age 57 do okay you've got your
your MOSFET cooling here connected by
one heat pipe to your northbridge cooler
and then that goes down by an via
another P pipe to your southbridge
cooler and I'm guessing there's probably
a say 26 as well as a USB 3 fo no chip
set under there somewhere actually the
USB chip sup might be somewhere else it
doesn't really matter okay over on the
side once again standard features you've
got your ddr3 dual channel slots and
they use the these unique seuss memory
slots where you can see that only one
side actually moves back and forth the
other side is just fixed so what you do
is you take the module you slide it in
this way and then you put it down and
then clip it into place so that's kind
of a neat feature that they've built
into a lot of their newer motherboards
on the very high end so then up here
we've got a four pin sorry a 4-pin an
8-pin cpu connector right where it
belongs at the top left of the board as
well as a bios reset switch right there
this there that is awesome because you
don't need a vile switch on the back
well mind you you have one but having
one here is so much smarter than all the
guys who are putting them wait a minute
is that even a bios switch no I don't
think it is that does something else
because yeah they've already got one
here they've got one on the back of the
board and then they've got another BIOS
switch down here at the bottom right of
the board which is also a fairly good
location for it because that's the kind
of place that you can actually access
even when you've got a couple graphics
cards installed which is what I was
about to say about this location no Q
reset yeah all right okay so let's keep
going down the board we've got our
24-pin connector right where it belongs
on the right-hand edge and then we have
a go button q led all right up here we
have probit so that is where you can
stick and a multimeter to find out what
the voltages are going to the CPU CPU
PLL I integrated memory controller the
RAM and PCH and then you've got a couple
ground connections there that's pretty
nice and then Q LED tells you CPU drm
vga boot device maybe it's some kind of
error reporting you know what they've
actually include
a lot of features with this board that
I've never seen before and I'm I've been
caught a little bit off my guard here
all right well why don't we keep just
keep on chugging along so download the
bottom side of the board here we have to
say de three so that's a 26 gigabit per
second as well as six say 22 so that's a
23 gigabit per second running off the
chipset and then we have the plx bridge
chip which a sous says is the best
solution for running say 26 and USB 3.0
because it gives them access to the full
bandwidth that they need okay then we've
got down at the bottom this motherboard
has it appears all four pin pwm fan
connectors built in so it has a ton of
them actually why don't I pull back and
have let you have a look at the whole
board and I'll show you where they all
know there's one here one here that's
two three four five six seven eight
eight four pin pwm fan connector so you
could potentially plug a cpu fan you
know and then seven case fans if you
felt like it okay so let's keep on going
here here's all your front panel
connectors as well as one more say to
port and that's probably running off the
same chipset as the one powering the
eSATA port on the back you have one two
three four five pci express 16x physical
connectors but not all of these are
actually going to run at pci express 16x
because with the p55 chipset you don't
actually have access to that mini PCI
Express Lanes down here on the bottom we
have a suz's stylized start and restart
buttons as well as a molex connector so
right there on the bottom of the board
you got a molex connector I'm going to
go ahead and assume that that's for
supplementary power for the PCI Express
slots I mean if you're plugging in you
know you could potentially do one two
three four Fergie's if you had a yeah if
you wanted to turn this into like a
folding board then yeah you definitely
need some supplementary power alright
then they've got another supplementary
power connector up here there's another
molex connector right there on the
motherboard and then
get around to the back panel so here
you're going to find two USB 2.0 ports a
ps2 keyboard port then you've got a CMOS
reset button and that actually is one
then you have a you a couple USB 3.0
ports you can tell by the blue color
coding then you have optical audio out
esatto firewire two more USB 2.0 ports
two more USB 2.0 this is actually kind
of confusing they've gone in color coded
USB to fight all act or red and then USB
3.0 so yeah that's okay I mean as long
as you remember blue is USB 3.0 and you
should be good you got gigabit ethernet
then you have the rog link as well as
the USB cable that connects to it then
you have 7.1 audio and that pretty much
wraps up my unboxing and overview of the
