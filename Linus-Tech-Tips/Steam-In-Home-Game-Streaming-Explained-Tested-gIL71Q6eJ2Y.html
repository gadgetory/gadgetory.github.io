for gaming click now to learn more valve
in-home streaming uses the power and
compatibility of a windows-based gaming
pc somewhere in the house to enable a
great gaming experience on other devices
and operating systems basically anything
that can run the Steam client Windows OS
10 or Linux can use it as long as the
hardware is powerful enough it works on
inexpensive desktop PCs notebook PCs or
even tablets so what does it do first of
all it's in beta so all of this is
subject to change but the basic set at
this point so here you go
in-home streaming uses your gaming
machine with a powerful graphics card
for example your office or your mancave
rig to act as the server and to run a
demanding game then with as little
latency as possible convert that to an
h.264 compressed video stream it then
sends that video stream over your home
network to another machine for example
your home theater PC that's hooked up to
your TV which acts as a client that can
without working very hard decode that
video stream and display it on the
screen at the same time the client PC
takes input commands from your game
controller or keyboard and mouse and
again latency is key here sends them
back to the server to actually control
the game the idea is that any PC with
adequate network performance and CPU
horsepower can let you play your games
the games on your gaming rig remotely so
what does it not do it does not allow
streaming over the Internet although I
suspect workarounds for that won't be
much of a stretch for the technically
inclined it does not allow multiple
people to use the server or streaming
machine at the same time so your office
gaming PC can have someone sitting at it
working on spreadsheets while you're
using the horsepower of that GPU to game
downstairs that will actually be running
the game on screen at the same time just
like in videos game stream technology
number three it does not allow logging
in from multiple locations on the same
work to the same account and playing
different games at the same time we'll
need Steam family sharing for that which
is hopefully coming soon number four it
does not allow higher resolutions than
the connected monitor of the server PC
the game must run on both PCs at the
same time so if your desktop computer
has a 720p monitor and your TV
downstairs is 1080p then your stream
will be limited to 720p the good news is
that the opposite is not true so as long
as your gaming PC has the same or higher
resolution as the other PC your remote
PC can scale that image down
appropriately number five is it's a
little bit finicky right now and it does
not have perfect game compatibility in
the future I'd expect this to be much
improved and you should be able to
stream most of the games in your Steam
library even the ones that you've added
manually number six it does not deliver
the greatest image quality
it's seemingly capped at about thirty
megabit per second maximum streaming
bitrate so that means color depth will
be lower which is perceived as
blockiness and what would otherwise be
smooth color transitions and it also
introduces artifacts some that are
difficult to notice and some that are
very very easy to notice such as these
around a crosshair in Battlefield Bad
Company 2 moving on to hardware
requirements valve has been pretty
tight-lipped about these probably
because this functionality just went
into beta and they are still working on
it
but there are a few things that we know
CPU performance will have to be enough
to decode and playback in h.264 video
stream at whatever frame rate and
resolution you're running officially
valve supports 720p and 1080p at either
30 or 60 fps network performance also
matters but how many megabits or
gigabits per second it can achieve is
not actually the most important thing
connection latency and reliability are
much more critical than throughput a
theoretically faster n or even AC
wireless connection will inherently drop
more frames than a normal Ethernet or
even a slow powerline network connection
because hardline networking performance
is much less susceptible to interference
speaking of interference forget about
2.4 gigahertz and wireless even
if the fruit put is fast enough there's
so much interference on that frequency
that 720 30s isn't a great experience 5
gigahertz Wireless n was much better
than I testing but that's a subject for
another video stay tuned for a follow-up
where we take a closer look at network
requirements the other requirement is
the PC actually doing the gaming has to
be powerful enough to run those games
that's kind of a given all of this aside
so we don't really know exactly what we
need if you are trying in-home streaming
and you're wondering how your
configuration is doing pressing f6 on
the client PC provides a somewhat useful
little analysis bar that drop pops up
and tells you latency dropped frames and
stuff like that I didn't always find
that the numbers correlated directly to
the gaming experience I was having
though so your mileage may vary but at
least it's in there so let's move on to
the practical demonstrations obviously
if you have two powerful gaming rigs you
could stream between them but gaming
locally would usually make more sense in
this case so I'm going to focus on some
demos for you guys that show how I think
this technology will be used
here's demo number one I'm using a Linux
in this case steam OS machine to run a
game that doesn't natively run on Linux
boom
your entire Windows game library now
runs on a modestly powerful Linux box no
excuse not to try it now hey in this
case this is batman arkham origins
running at 1080p 60fps and here's demo
number two this old low-cost low-power
sapphire machine has an AMD e450
dual-core apu with integrated graphics
in spite of its age and lackluster
performance I can have a console grade
gaming experience that is to say 720p
30fps with no frame loss while playing
the latest games in this case I've got
Battlefield Bad Company 2 running here
but that was just for the sake of you
know mixing up our games a little bit
here's demo number three this is a thin
enlight notebook with integrated intel
graphics and I love fitted lights
they're portable there's this one
there's this one this one can work as a
notebook or a tablet it's super
lightweight but like many people I had
to make the decision between portability
and gaming performance not anymore
here it is running BioShock Infinite
at 1080p 30fps this is wirelessly and
the experience isn't perfect but if you
have a USB to Ethernet adapter even this
one right here a dual-core Ultrabook was
able to stream at 1080p 60fps very very
impressive now we're getting into
experimental territory demo number four
is I finna t3 by 1080p it didn't work
with lots of games and it was more of an
exercise in pushing the limits rather
than trying to deliver a great gaming
experience but it worked it's not
fantastic latency feels noticeably
higher and the framerate especially when
moving around consistently can't go
above about 20 fps which is interesting
because we're at three times the
resolution of 1080p so being only able
to achieve 20 FPS or one third of 60 FPS
the maximum allowable value in the valve
settings looks like it may be an
artificially imposed limitation one that
valve could unlock in the future by
giving us higher bit rates for higher
resolution streaming the grand finale
our most elaborate test setup yet we
have two 4k TVs one with our Radeon r9
290x gaming machine and the other with
my pretty run-of-the-mill
I mean it's a GTX 670 so it's pretty
decent but this is with my steam machine
you can see they're connected NCIX was
generous enough to let us come and tear
apart two stores to get access to these
two 4k tvs run ethernet cables between
two tapering stores but we are pretty
much ready to find out if this is going
to work so we are setting we are
limiting our resolution to the desktop
resolution which happens to be a 38 20
by 2160 so that's 4k which obviously
isn't a setting that we can actually you
know set here so we're going to set our
bandwidth to unlimited our frame rate to
automatic and we're going to find out if
this works I've been working on this for
about an hour and a half to get this set
up so let's fire up portal 2
and see if it flies not defeated yet but
we discovered an issue and that is that
the Nvidia graphics card in here with
the Linux drivers that it has to run
because this is a running steam OS does
not support a 4k output over HDMI yet so
we switched to a Windows machine we
tried to use mini DisplayPort to active
dual link HD or DVI to HDMI and it
showed up as a selection in the
resolution options but then the TV spat
that out so conveniently we're at NCIX
and we have another notebook sitting
right here and we are now installing
steam we're running at 4k on that one so
we're going to find out if this is
actually going to work very shortly it's
working actually we uh we've shot in the
dark
we went and fired up Batman and it's
working
capturing 3840 by 2160 at around 20 oh
my goodness it just dipped down to 14
frames per second out something on a
little bit concerned about is the link
utilization here it's telling me 21
percent of estimated and it's not going
above 100 megabit per second so I'm
wondering if we might have a slower than
gigabit connection for some reason if we
might have a bad Ethernet cable or
something like that but I'm going to go
ahead and confirm these changes and we
are definitely running at 4k resolution
now the the bitrate is not really enough
to sustain it properly you can tell it's
quite blocky but in terms of sheer
resolution it's running so there you
have it guys
Batman Arkham origins running in 4k over
the network using steam in-home
streaming is it a perfect experience
absolutely not it's leggy as all balls
right now and the the low bitrate so
it's about 32 megabit even when we're
maxing everything out we're running at
4k makes it look not nearly as good as
if you're actually sitting right in
front of it but the fact that it works
at all just shows such promise for this
technology in the future and when you
consider as well how functional the
1080p version
is and how low latency that is and how
we're going to see better network
connections and faster processors on
either side in the future I think it is
just so exciting and there's so much
promise for this technology so thanks
guys for checking out our steam in-home
streaming video don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and thanks again to NCIX for
letting us come in here and borrow their
two 4k TVs to try this out
