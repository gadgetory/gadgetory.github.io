are going to take this hot tub and turn
it into the ultimate gaming experience
with this LG signature W series 77 inch
OLED TV yes my friends we are creating
the world's first gaming hot tada
here in Delta British Columbia thermal
takes a 500 case has a modern minimalist
design with brushed aluminum panels and
dual hinge swing tempered glass doors
check it out today at the link below
the idea is that right there you're in
your hot tub you got your drinks and you
got your bangin TV right there I'm
having kind of an anxiety moment here so
the box for the TV the TV is actually
not that much smaller it's just about up
to this line on my hoodie pocket here
yeah okay I don't know if I describe it
as perfect cuz like you're sitting in
here probably fine actually so I'm going
to the outside of the post what are we
looking at 107 inches so we need 10-foot
2x4 oh yeah three two by fours one piece
of plywood will hold up it's eight feet
in between the two have some shelf
supplies so why don't we get another
piece of plywood and some L brackets and
let's see if we can shelf it up okay and
maybe a couple more two by fours I I
don't think you'll love to you love to
my force so much why don't you marry
them it's bar exception why are you
there why are under the box Dennis just
I don't understand the things you do
let's go shopping
I only know to do this cuz my dad showed
me he's like yeah you got a you got a
check further you know how warped it is
it's pretty warped but we don't really
care what are you doing
hooch who carries a 2x4 like that that
looks pretty nice yeah that's actually
not that bad okay cool that's not a
thing no so we got our haul here we got
four pieces of wood in this shape we got
two we got two pieces of wood that are
shaped more kind of like this we've got
one piece of wood that shaped real flat
and then some screws cuz we're men and
brackets man brackets I'm a supervisor
Dennis why look at this wood why would
you hold it there
good job subject you know that your
what is really long yeah so we mount you
to the back of the fro it's got to be
the back otherwise the range just gonna
rain on that there wanna make expensive
TV 107 Dennis boy are you going there
but we know oh come on Dennis it's a
hundred and seven inches should we
double check his measurement should we
double check just hold that side let's
do it
no I actually don't at all it's actually
under 107 that's the rate on 100 what I
was holding it no what it's literally
square I know I swear he's really good
at something I'm a little short it's not
that it matters it's just that you were
right and none of us want to admit it no
I don't at all yeah we're a little short
all right so that there's the top of our
ingenious hot tub gaming now you think
how many do you need Jake Jake Jake it's
overkill it's fine what are you doing
can you let go just turn it up let go
yeah this is like oh so like this piece
of wood is flat on my side Brandon and
it's pretty not flat on that side that's
actually like the line now it's a lot
better than it was
- you move the piece of wood let's let's
do let's do some cool measuring of the
TV to find out how big this thing
actually even needs to be alright ladies
and gentlemen let's measure this TV I
was thinking more like so uh you need
your hot tub cleaned sixteen your shirt
sixty eight you sure it's not sixty nine
like why don't we just lie it down on
the top of the hot tub what are you
doing get it out of the way Dennis get
it hey so here's the piece that actually
goes on the piece of plywood 68 by 39
there we go okay Dennis you can move
your hand now there we go okay yeah
there but we mounted a piece of plywood
it's very flexibly it's actually glass
no it's like actually very flexible like
check this out it's super flexible
honestly can you help me Center it well
it looks crooked coz the decks cookin
yeah I know yeah I mean we probably
should have just made it yeah well
that's why you're that's why we have so
many people here we're supposed to be
waterproofing the Xbox controllers so
we're going to basically use a
combination of brush-on conformal
coating and spray-on conformal coating
I'm probably just gonna end up like
going ham with the spray quite frankly I
mean obviously we're not making this
controller waterproof like I wouldn't
recommend when we're done just like
throwing it in the water or anything
like that but it will be quite water
resistant to the point where I don't
know if the steam would end up being a
problem or not look I'm not saying you
guys suck at this but I will say that
James and I did not have nearly this
much difficulty oh wait oh oh yeah
she's on there I don't trust it honestly
this thing's so what no like it could be
in and I'll just stay here for the rest
of the day hold it I'm scared
that's sick yeah so that's pretty cool
and then what I need to do is make
little masking pieces for anything that
I don't want to get conformal coating on
it so we don't have a whole lot of time
to do multiple coats and let them dry so
we're going pretty ham here so here you
can see I've taped over my battery
contacts my connectors between the PCBs
as well as all my button contact pads
here so let's hope this one also works
if on skin wash with plenty of water
cool I'm gonna go do that okay so to say
I put it on a little heavy would be a
gross understatement
it's like gooped all over this chip
hopefully that's okay it's definitely
drying it is possible that this
controller is completely fubar gentlemen
I didn't realize that there were pores
in this tape and so everything I taped
off might have conformal coating on it
as you guys can see the brackets for the
shelves are actually a little bit too
long so we need to put the second 2x4 in
here and then we should be able to get
the second screw in and it shouldn't be
so little wobbly all is good
I tried to goof off the area and just
started to take some of the green color
off the top of the PCB here so that's
that's interesting this is unplayable
okay Dennis don't let him do it
oh that's meant how's it look this is
the moment when we find out if Oh LEDs
work in sub-zero weather direct sunlight
yeah sub-zero yeah a little bit of glare
do we have power whoa are there
batteries in this remote hey I think I'm
on oh okay
this one works this one works this one
doesn't this one doesn't
this one dies this one dies that one
does Alan does it's crazy like it's so
flat like it basically looks like it's
just like in the wood like do you guys
notice that like it's just like kind of
trippy like you're just like oh it's
there yeah okay there's a seam there but
not not by not by much
this is crazy it's actually looking
shockingly good given that the Sun is
just like on the screen all right
Mario we devised a plan we recruited
agent Janice from accounting equipped
her with 1,500 US dollars per system and
gave her some outdoor theater stuff
right here
it actually sounds not bad like
especially if you get down on the level
of the TV I think we actually got the
height just right like when we're
sitting in here it's gonna be perfect
you guys ready we hot tubbin okay you
guys ready here we go look at that it's
almost like we measured it before we did
this all right
I've never actually played over cooked
with oh the keyboard and mouse before so
you ready I'm too short where's Table
Rock wait on the place put on the plate
right in front of me you see the green
guy yeah okay no we don't know horse no
more shrimp side kitchen calls for
exactly zero what are you talking about
okay so more shrimp oh fish
no no jeez
guys this is straight-up sick this is
really sick hot tub gaming is an under
underexplored okay concept here stop
fish here boys if your name is that
Linus Sebastian don't touch the rice I'm
in charge of rice so we time the rice
man I got it
oh no it's red I can't believe how good
this looks in spite of the fact that
it's not even nighttime right now we
have Sun on the TV and you can barely
tell like that's what contrast that's
what like high contrast is all about
right if you can barely even tell where
the sun's hitting it like yeah you can
tell because you're not idiots
why are other people doing rice just
leave it and Colton are you not on top
of this as men well I got him here dude
I'm just trying to help man lucky
let me hear if you want some rice

game Denis is like actively sabotaging
everything I gotta pick up my player if
you gonna put a cucumber on the plate
that it just takes it walks around guys
all right when we came into this video
we straight up we're not expecting
anyone to set up a hot tub TV but now
that we've done it it's pretty good it's
good it's pretty good it's pretty thick
