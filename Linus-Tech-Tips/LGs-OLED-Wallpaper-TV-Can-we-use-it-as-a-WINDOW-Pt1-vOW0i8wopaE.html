organization vlog definitely incoming so
you guys can pulverize the like button
if you're stoked on that but that is not
the subject of today's video today's
video is all about how the window in my
office that we just remodeled and
decorated got moved to here leaving you
with no window and the super high-tech
solution that I'm going to use to fix
the problem
savage jerky is created without the use
of nitrates or preservatives use offer
code LTT to save 10% through the link in
the video description okay so we had to
make a choice replace the window that
used to be for looking out over my
empire with a window for looking out
into part of a stairwell part of an
office space and part of the middle of a
wall or rip it out and drywall over it
leaving me with only tragically a window
out into the bench den now obviously
since you're already watching footage of
it we went with dry walling over it so
that's done now but as you can see they
didn't actually paint over it to get it
to blend in because while a plain wall
would have been fine we had a much
cooler idea one that some members of our
floatplane community totally clued into
during our exclusive office update
videos over the last eight weeks what if
we could use the LG Signature Series
OLED wallpaper TV that we first saw at
CES to kind of have a window here to
anywhere it's less than four millimeters
thin so Yvonne actually came up with a
few different concepts one that's more
of a meeting place so the idea is that
like you could be sitting here chilling
discussing something while giraffes are
like nearby and then two of them that
are more like workspaces where it could
be used as a window or a backdrop or
just to watch videos play games or
whatever although I'm gonna need I'm
gonna need some blinds for my office so
no one can see that I'm just totally
wasting time in here so to evaluate its
utility for our purposes
Tylar set the TV up on a sacrificial
wall here that's actually gonna be torn
down as part of some ongoing set
construction over the next couple of
months all of the electronics for the TV
are in a separate speaker bar unit so
the way it now
is actually by screwing a big flat piece
on to the wall then there are these
little washers at the top that jut out a
bit to support the weight and then the
TV is held flat against the wall by
magnets oh I just pulled it off there
you go
okay first things first though I need to
figure out why it's not actually sitting
flat right now okay so is it not lifting
up here we go oh man that is so trippy
look at this thing
okay so Tyler if I hold it it's crazy
how light it is I got it yeah so well if
we if we were to screw this in does that
look better okay so we need to screw
this in okay that's definitely flat
these ones are good so how do you line
this up are you on it so we're both on
all right and now now it's flat awesome
that was a relatively simple fix
perfect look at that okay beautiful
fingerprints removed let's fire it up
okay so now all we need is some stuff to
hook up to it and let's get this party
started
first things first I will need a gaming
capable test bench Titan XP baby that's
the thing about reorganizing is you
don't know where anything is and so that
and the last piece ah there we go
our Ultra HD blu-ray player HDMI cable
of choice
Xbox one this so all the i/o power this
ribbon up to the TV bottom kind of yank
it on pretty hard here Ethernet USB and
then HDMI is all along this little
bottom unit here pretty cool that wants
to go right there okay so this thing
really doesn't match our color scheme we
got going on here maybe we can kind of I
don't know what cooling is gonna be like
but I mean realistically come on there's
an Xbox I'm not gonna play games on it
so hopefully it'll stay cool enough to
play back blue or hazing then we're good
okay I switch to that input remote
hasn't changed since the last LG
signature that's not necessarily a
problem though I actually really like
the arrow pointy doodad thing that we
got going on here no keyboard detective
quick
it is kind of amazing how much of a
difference it makes to the look when
there's no bottom bezel at all and when
we install it as the as a window we're
actually gonna hide the ribbon cable so
it's just gonna be floating there I
don't even know if I'm gonna be able to
play back these red raw files here this
is not good news yeah without the the
playback bar I could kind of buy that
you know what I think we're gonna have
to do though this is funny I'm gonna
have to get Brandon to shoot at a higher
framerate I think to make it a bit more
believable 60 fps 8k footage baby you
know it's times like this I really hate
that we have to upload our videos to
YouTube where they get compressed to
help cuz honestly this looks amazing and
the bitrate isn't even that high like we
export it
I mean it's high enough that my Wi-Fi
connection is causing it to buffer but
look at this honestly this is worth just
pausing on to admire it so that's 8k
footage off one of the world's best
cameras on arguably the world's best TV
look at the detail in the water and look
you could like see Brendan's face you
know so if there was any doubt that we
actually shot this Tomb Raider very high
running at 4k 60fps that's gorgeous
okay so last order of business let's
fire up a 4k HDR blu-ray ok HDCP
handshake with the Xbox 1s is running
perfectly and I think we're basically
greenlit on this project to everything
that I expected to be good about it is
good about it I mean none of this is
really that surprising I'm already
running an LG OLED at home but stay
tuned for part two because we have quite
a plan check this out I was playing with
this
camera you can actually bend this thing
