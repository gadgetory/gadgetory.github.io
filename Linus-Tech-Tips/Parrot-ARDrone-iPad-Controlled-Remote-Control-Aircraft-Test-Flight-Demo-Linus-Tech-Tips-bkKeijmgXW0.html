the ar.drone but sad this is the first
one that I'm going to be doing on camera
so just want to show you guys the drone
itself I did not boxing but I'll just
give you a general overview so included
you've got the inside hull so the indoor
hall I'm not going to be using that
since I am flying outside today so I
have the orange and yellow outdoor hall
the outdoor hall doesn't provide
protection for the propellers but it
does offer slightly better performance
because it's lighter weight as well as
better battery life once again because
it's lighter weight so the motors don't
have to work as hard so I've got the
included one thousand milliamp hour lipo
battery it's fresh off the charger so I
should get about twelve minutes of
flight time out of it depending on how
hard it has to work so just go ahead and
put that in like that now immediately I
plugging in the battery the LED lights
turn on I'm just going to put the unit
over there for a second and I want to
show you guys the binding process so
what you do is you go and look for the
Wi-Fi network that is AR Drone whatever
your AR Drone happens to be so once
you've connected so the AR Drone is its
own hotspot so you'll see the Wi-Fi will
turn on there and then all you do is go
into I've got a AR free flight and then
I actually have a couple of third party
apps drone ace and drone control these
are cool they allow for some additional
functionality like flashing the LEDs
different colors performing a couple
stunts like wiggling back and forth
spinning circles that kind of stuff as
well as recording video and photos I'm
just going to be using the AR Drone om
one to start with here actually
sometimes it takes a minute to to
connect properly and to boot up so why
don't I finish let's see Oh yep there we
go so connecting checking updating
bootloader and checking version I did
have to update the airdrome the first
time I used it but it was a simple
process and it was just a matter of
doing an over-the-air upgrade took about
five
between the iPad and the air drone
itself so you can see the front mounted
camera here I'm standing in front of it
now those are my feet so here this
should give you some idea of what the
delay is like on the camera can you see
my foot as well as the iPad okay so you
guys can see that so it's not
instantaneous but it's pretty darn good
and then there's also the bottom mounted
camera so now you can see the ground
underneath the AR Drone so you can
switch between those and there's also a
picture in picture view mode where we
can see the bottom camera here and the
top camera here or the front camera here
in the bottom camera here okay
well I'll show you the basic controls as
well before we get started here so you
can reposition the joysticks anywhere
you want just by pressing down so you
can see this the guys moving around so
pressing down on the iPad here allows me
to control the ar.drone front back side
but set aside movement just by tilting
the iPad and then this guy does up-down
and then rotating left and rotating
right so like this okay up and down like
that okay ah there's also an emergency
button to cut out and then this is the
takeoff and land button I'm not going to
press that just yet so let's go ahead
and put the whole on it's just a matter
of slipping it on the front here alright
now this drone has actually been through
some fairly impressive crashes so far
and I have to say the durability of this
thing compared to RC devices that I've
used in the past is outstanding actually
here I'll show you a couple of the
durability related features so number
one is the awesome foam that they use on
the hauls themselves they can take quite
a beating now I've had pieces of them
actually snap but I was able to I can't
even find the part that was broken on
this one anymore I was able to repair
them quite easily using a little bit of
epoxy the propellers are also made of a
very flexible material so that means
that once they hit something they do
have some give to them so they won't
just snap instantly and also they the
electronics in the AR Drone will allow
it to actually cut out all four motors
as soon as one of them encounters
resistance so if you hit a branch for
example it'll cut out all the motors the
AR Drone drops down and
what happens is that prevents further
damage to the more delicate motors and
gear assemblies versus if they did not
cut out when I hit the ground and bad
things happen okay
now I did have one particularly bad
crash I just want to show you guys this
can you see that that's kind of mangled
and can you see that the gear is kind of
bent you can get replacement parts
actually I should mention this for
almost every part of the ar.drone with
the replacement part list you can pretty
much build an AR Drone from scratch if
you wanted to you can get replacement
housings bases motherboards all that
kind of stuff anyway you can get
replacement gears I don't have any and I
do need to use it for this video so what
I did was what happened was I hit a
branch and then it fell down directly
onto a curb so the odds of this kind of
thing happening were pretty much slim to
none but it happened to me of course it
fell from about eight feet high so that
was bad so this broke off and he can you
see the bend there okay so what I did
was I glued it to tack it in place and
then I melted the plastic back together
and it actually see the gears still work
so it actually flies okay which is kind
of remarkable so I'm just going to show
you guys a quick plate here around my
backyard and I apologize for that
segment of the garden we haven't done
anything with that yet that's more like
what we're aiming for here but it's sort
of one year at a time here so here we go
takeoff time so the AR Drone
automatically takes off and hovers a
couple feet above the ground so here
let's show you guys the the basic
control so here's your up
as soon as you let go of the controls
the AR Drone will actually hover itself
which is remarkable compared to most
other RC devices out there it actually
uses the bottom mounted camera to keep
itself from drifting around just very
cool so here you go I can control the
yaw don't worry I'm not gonna pointed at
you okay so I'm going to rotate it until
I can see myself here hold on little bit
more a little bit more just go nice and
gently gently tuck I'll just move there
you go so now you guys can see good you
don't have to keep moving I'm moving
myself so you can see me in the iPad
right there you go
can also see the AR Drone holding itself
still in the air over there so let's go
ahead and let's move it around a little
bit so as I mentioned before as soon as
you put your thumb here you can start to
control the AR Drone by tilting it back
and forth so that's your general
movement control now I can move quite
fast so let's go ahead we'll just go
forward and we'll just kind of do a
little circuit here
now I would definitely recommend for
your first few flights that you do them
indoors because it's a little bit tricky
to get the hang of especially when the
orientation of the drone is changing
around in the air in front of you so
sometimes it's kind of hard to tell
which way to tilt it to turn the way you
want to turn okay so like I said no
matter what you're doing let's say
you're going on here let's bring it this
way so let's say you're moving forward
let go the controls boom a our drone
will hover just like that very cool
right okay so now there's a lot of
debate on the interwebs about whether
the AR drone can actually be piloted
when you don't have a line of sight to
it I would say yes but slowly so here
I'm gonna take you guys around the other
side of my house you're probably going
to want to be looking at the iPad here
because the AR Drone won't be visible
very soon so here we go
hold on like I said when you let go of
it it will immediately stop so here I
don't want to get too close to those
branches so I'm just going to check
around make sure we're not too close to
anything here that's good that's good so
I think we're we're high little low
enough that we won't touch on those so
here we go
you can stop at any time we can look
around there's my ladder
there's my gas meter there's my barbecue
and there is uh here I'll show you guys
where I am hello I'm over here can you
see me yes or no yeah you can see me
okay so that's what the responsiveness
is like when you're flying the AR Drone
in a no line-of-sight type scenario okay
let's bring it back around to the front
and take it back over there and now you
can see I have brought the drone back
from where it was now there's a couple
things to bear in mind when you're
flying the drone one is the amount of
advanced electronics that's in there
Thanks couple cool things so the camera
keeps it from drifting it also has an
ultrasound transmitter and receiver on
the bottom of it that's how it knows
what height to stay at so if I go and I
put it at this height up to I believe it
is three meters the AR Drone can control
its height within a very accurate ring
check this out so you can see
it hardly drifts at all now what that
means though is that if I were to take
the AR Drone and I were to put it up at
a height of about five meters and fly
over those hedges on the left as soon as
it is above the hedges it would take off
five meters above that so be careful
with your drone if you go and you try
and fly over a shed or over your house
you're gonna fly it up twenty feet it's
going to jump up another twenty feet get
caught in a cross breeze and get blown
away and then you're going to be buying
some replacement parts so yeah I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
about it right now there's a great
modding community around for this thing
already which is which is just
outstanding because there's mods to to
control it with a standard RC controller
there's mods to do all kinds of neat
stuff with it and it is a very very cool
device there's also extended batteries
out there so you can fly for about 20
minutes at a time and I think that's
pretty much it so why don't we bring it
in for a landing here
press the landing button and down it
goes thanks for checking out my demo
video of the parrot ar.drone just so you
guys know the way that I'm flying it now
I've only flown it about 10 to 12 times
so that should give you some idea what
the learning curves like this thing is
outstanding compared to other RC
aircraft that I have used in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
