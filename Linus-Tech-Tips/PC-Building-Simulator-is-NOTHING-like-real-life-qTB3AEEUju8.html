this have you heard about this I've
never actually played one of these
simulator games but I was intrigued when
I saw this would having actual PC
building experience translate to the
game and vice versa can you actually
learn to build a PC with PC building
simulator to find out we've got me an
experienced PC builder and we've got a
control group Dennis who will win we're
not sure because there aren't really any
rules in this challenge thanks to video
blocks for sponsoring today's video
they're an awesome subscription-based
resource for downloading stock footage
video and more stay tuned for an awesome
offer from them later on
while you know how this works no it
looks real
what and he didn't think it was a real
game it's a PC looks looks real but no
it doesn't he doesn't so there's a
number of problems one it clearly looks
like a 3d graphic right to the power
supply isn't plugged into almost
anything oh okay I think this is gonna
be a cakewalk
welcome to PC building simulator to
begin go to your PC and open the email
program on your desktop go to you've got
mail wow that way too bad is an old
reference well that's a long email
don't write long emails this is so
cheesy already the letter that reminding
you to put thermal paste in is signed by
uncle Tim objectives PC can boot to OS
remove viruses oh okay plug in the cable
how do i plug in the cable okay so you
click and hold cables to plug them in
where I couldn't even plug in a cable
that's wait I can't okay I'm installing
the virus this is gonna be so easy
Dennis you're terrible luck in the cable
okay click and hold it and click and
hold it no no just click click and hold
oh no no stop don't drag with you clay I
say click and hold click on there and
hold click and hold oh wow I wish real
virus scanners ran that fast to be
honest I don't even know how to remove
email get paid select I made a hundred
bucks for removing those viruses oh dang
why it was my - $15 how do I remove that
virus I have already fixed that computer
and I have left the office for the day
not surprised how do I remove the virus
okay you give me some hint but you don't
remove viruses by working on the tower
go look at the screen no what do you
mind you pick up the computer plug it
back in oh god how to do that again what
are you even doing
I can't plug in the cables she wants a
970 Xin Xin gamer she I'm getting the
cheaper one I'm gonna make more money on
this job yo this gnome virus removal
program there's no remove viruses you
didn't put in your USB oh I need to
Kevin USB

outta here three Rams and he will have
16 GB GB in total i order through your
Rams they charge me and he NSA is
already in transit oh it's not scam
right all right
you wanna do build-off oh this is
another game this is just a warm-up oh
yeah this is the game okay well yeah but
you lost this game so we're gonna try
another game how about this client I
quit you just quit your job just like
that
okay so Dennis and I are doing our free
build challenge now to see who can build
the best rig the fastest wait none of
the piss
PC here that works they are all just
computer cases oh here here on the show
no the clip closet over there yep there
you go oh wow
so I can just put in like the best stuff
I whatever I want
oh oh hyper beast no I don't want that I
hate you okay fine fine fine
I'm putting $1,000 power supply in my
system this yeah very good thing yeah
we're going oh we're going X 3 9 5 why
do you have to do first you have to put
motherboard other boy I know I know
mother boys cool Oh inaccurate
inaccurate this motherboard does not
have a screw hole here this hasn't been
used since like Intel branded boards
this system is gonna break immediately
because it'll short out the back of the
board because I have an extra standoff
in it yeah you only need like four
screws I'm not I'm not Linus Dennis
Dennis I'm putting on thermal paste
already now that's a geek up by GA and
what process there can you put in there
I don't know oh they all look the same
go okay i needa what's that called paste
now you either put the processor in
there first
you're never roses in there you need a
paste to put a processor right
wait I'm right I'm not joking you have
to open and put this paste and put a CPU
what's wrong with that okay fine fine
fine
Oh pick one I'll get rice and five quark
or 1400 I don't know if that's cool but
that sounds cool meanwhile I just put a
hundred twenty eight gigs of ram into my
system okay yeah yeah I do
I saw the paces before the sleepy oh my
god no it's so stupid
see that oh that's right baby mmm don't
drop it
even that's enough um it's a good
yeah thanks upload rice okay maybe what
color charcoal huh purple
I don't like purple though oh man this
is actually okay yep take off the back
panel and no I know I know what's next
you do that you do that and Bram oh no
don't tell me I know it doesn't fit
that's a wrong hole rims are short-term
memory of the pea seeds okay and you
don't need any paste in the memory slot
before you put it in I know
do you know that yeah
the whole stuff it it's I mean it
doesn't let me put it he stuck he
doesn't let me put it in you can
actually connect like your fan hub
Wow so my cabling can actually be neat
too so I can connect my design hub to
the board and then I can connect all my
fans to the hub nice so Tito I actually
have to open up the next one Shh
this one's GPU no you always say GPU
last right Wow
maybe he did pick out something up in
the last three years right I'll do some
hard drive by a hardened an SSD III SSD
don't change my mind
there's no SSD anyways oh this oh my god
pony in it okay I got it I got it
power supply power supply hmm didn't
have enough SATA ports on this board for
all my dried so though funnily enough if
i zoom in on the board it looks like it
does have enough it just doesn't know
that so I was right game was wrong just
want to make sure that the record
straight here I feel that's you
you feel that - what are you even
talking about okay I'm not good at
graphics card 1080 Tandy school maybe 10
80s for hosers what boom all the
motherboard
done
look at those aren't I'll look at those
light up there this baby then it's the
kid you lost the game that would wait
can you look at my look at my setup
alright you will you're short of em
stick for one thing why my god after
three yeah that's wrong why is that
wrong and the only need three four what
what do you mean I need I just want
three okay I have more Reni more well
use only three slots I guarantee you
there's another slot oh yeah it's hiding
I thought
haha so in a nutshell you know what
actually a lot cooler than I thought it
would be you're not actually gonna learn
how to be a PC tech and you're not gonna
be able to jump right from PC building
simulator into building your own
computer there are some fairly
significant oversights as a way to kind
of fool around and get comfortable with
the idea of digging a little deeper
watching maybe one of our videos on how
to build a PC honestly it's not the
worst 20 bucks you could possibly spend
so overall recommended if you've ever
needed a quick video clip for b-roll an
After Effects template or a motion
background video blocks is the answer we
use video blocks here when we're

featured at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join and Dennis should
join so that you can learn a thing or
two about how to build a computer I know
how to be you in real life I know how to
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
