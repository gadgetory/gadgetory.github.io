some things just cannot be expressed on
a spec sheet these you shouldna say Kwas
of usability or industrial design can
elevate the experience of using an
object be it a phone or a pair of
premium toenail clippers from merely
practical to ethereal but at what cost
well it turns out the answer is $2,500
introducing the book one from Porsche
design a laptop designed to get your
motor running and I'll tell you about it
right after we keep the LTTE motor
running with this message from ZOTAC so
tacks ZBOX pcs are great for
applications like streaming and gaming
they feature Intel seventh generation
core processors in tiny form factors
check them out at the link below
okay so the industrial design is pretty
impressive it's got a matte anodized
aluminum chassis with soft campers and
polished edges and all 1580 grams of it
looks and feels amazing when closed with
a hinge design that is subjectively
anyway among the best that we've seen on
a 2 in 1 it's got just the right amount
of resistance and goes all the way
around without requiring you to take the
screen off first or leaving a weird gap
like the Microsoft Surface book does by
the way Porsche designs claims that the
hinge design was inspired by the gearbox
of a sports car but I think it's just as
likely that the marketing department
thought of that after the fact anywho
that's not the only trick up its sleeve
like the surface book and incidentally
the Starship Enterprise book one can
also be separated from its base entirely
and used as a tablet by holding down the
eject button on the side and pulling it
apart a process that is slightly less
jank than the surface book the 13.3 inch
16 by 9 screen is actually pretty nice
with a 3200 by 1800 qhd+ resolution and
10-point multi-touch along with support
for the 4096 pressure level book one pen
by Wacom that looks as cool as the rest
of the product and that can apparently
run for eight months off of its fun
sized quadruple a battery the IO is
probably best described as thoughtful I
mean there isn't a ton of it but it's
really well placed the base has a USB C
port that lets the book one charge in
just two hours then two more USB 3.0
ports for regular stuff and a microSD
slot for expansion then the tablet
portion has a very welcome Thunderbolt 3
port a 5 megapixel camera with IR 4
windows hello and a headphone jack that
doesn't leave the cord floating in the
air like Microsoft's design so as
advertised it's all pretty in premium
right
well not so fast we did find a few skid
marks on this road while the keyboard is
easy to type on the key caps are smaller
than the keys on the surface book
because the gaps between the keys aren't
as finely milled meaning that you
actually have a little bit less keyboard
in the same footprint the keys
themselves also seem to have a bit of a
resistance right at the top of the
stroke that puts the typing experience a
bit on the fatiguing side if you have
dainty fingers like I do as for the
Microsoft precision certified touch pad
well it's big works beautifully and
actually handles very similarly to the
one on the surface book except that on
the posh designs it makes this noise
that well I don't know let us know what
you guys think
finally the suspension is a little
looser than I'd prefer the screen has
enough bezel that you'd think it has
like an extra touch bar on it or
something and because of the way the
hinge is designed the detached tablet
has asymmetrical corners now this stuff
may sound pretty nitpicky but this is
the kind of scrutiny that you expose
yourself to when you charge a premium
for your premium design so should you
buy this notebook maybe but not before
we take a pit stop to talk about the
internals the book one had really good
specs when it launched but that was back
in April and yes I know we're like way
late on this thing but we wanted to
check it out anyway because it's cool
the point though is that that was before
rise in mobile mobile or coffee lake
were things that existed as it is today
everything but the dual-core CPU holds
up pretty well and thermals are pretty
good as a half hour of stress testing in
i-264 never made her throttle and noise
wise she never stood out against our
offices HVAC but you might have noticed
that I never specified what graphics
card is inside and that is because
there's no discreet graphics so no you
won't be able to play mankind
divided at 1080p even on low settings
making it kind of hard to recommend the
book one since the new surface book 2
has an eighth gen core i7 processor and
a gtx 1050 for about the same price back
to whether to buy them I'm the kind of
person who would prefer a graphics card
to a sexy hinge and a sexy design but
Porsche designs clearly believes that
there is more to the device experience
than raw horsepower and we'd love to
hear from you guys in the comments below
