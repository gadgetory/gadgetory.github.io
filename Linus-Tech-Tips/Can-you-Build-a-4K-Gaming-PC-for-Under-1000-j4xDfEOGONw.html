one's going to be a little bit different
instead of trying to put a computer
under liquid or digging space or
anything like that we're actually going
to be building something a little more
down-to-earth it's only around a
thousand bucks for a gaming rig and you
might kind of go okay well - what could
be interesting about this and I'll tell
you this is actually based on a
challenge that was issued to me by the
folks over at Andy who kind of went 4k
displays are becoming a lot more
affordable right now but the perception
among gamers is that you can't really
drive games at that resolution and to a
degree that is correct in the latest
triple-a titles running at Ultra rez
you're going to need like multiple of
the highest end graphics cards in order
to get a playable enjoyable experience
but they also continued what about the
titles that people are actually playing
all the time you're free to play games
like League of Legends or Team Fortress
2 or your more mainstream or eSport C
titles like csgo or Starcraft 2 what
could you build an affordable computer
that can run those games at 4k now that
the price of really nice displays like
this Acer I've got right here are coming
way way down all the time well let's
find out shall we
going back to my purchase of a viewsonic
P 95 F + B I believe that a display can
last you through several of these bad
boys if you choose one of sufficient
quality for your needs now and in the
future
my old dell 24:05 fpw actually got
retired from use by my wife only a
couple months ago when she saw LG's 29
ultra wide so the component choices for
this rig were a little different than
normal
we didn't over build the PC in an
attempt to run every game at 4k but we
also didn't want to build the most
budget cheapo gaming rig ever either it
was meant to be a reasonable bang for
the buck sweet spot so around 900 to
$1,000 gaming and multi-purpose AMD
based PC with some upgrade ability and
with the ultimate plan of passing it
along and replacing it with a new sweet
spot rig when the time is right a
strategy that can actually yield much
better value for the money in the long
run versus trying to spend you know
twice as much on a machine in the first
place in an attempt to get it to last
twice as long not to mention that this
way you end up with two machine so you
can repurpose your old rig for a friend
or family member or server or whatever
else down the line so at the heart of
the rig is an FX 63 56 core CPU although
a 6300 is also a great choice if you
don't mind doing a little bit of
overclocking we could have stuck with
the 8 core that AMD accidentally put in
the motherboard that they sent us but
given how many threads modern games
support and the growing support for
lower CPU overhead API is like mantle
and DirectX 12 I don't feel like
spending a bunch more on a CPU is a
great investment for a sweet spot PC
today
I don't know which sets on our
motherboard is an assigned 9 7 D gaming
board it looks nice if that matters to
you it's reasonably well built it
includes support for 2-week Frostfire if
you wanted to add another graphics part
in the future although it should be
noted that sweet spot rigs usually live
their lives with a single graphics card
and it's got a solid i/o layout with 4
USB 3 ports we kitted it out with 8 gigs
of the heaviest memory that we've ever
seen now I'm just kidding it wasn't
heavy but we had to justify needing two
people to build one computer somehow we
used an AMD branded kit but any dual
channel ddr3 would work just fine if
you're a heavy multitasker you might opt
for 16 gigs right off the bat but RAM
upgrades are one of those things that's
easy and inexpensive to do later on down
the road when and if you need more
that's where all my print jobs with I
mean what some print job our drive power
supply in case choices aren't terribly
important for gaming performance but
I'll let you know what we used anyway we
went with a 240 gig Kingston SSDs that
we had lying around the office although
you could pick any value SSD for your
boot drive these days a 2 terabyte WD
green for mass storage and for large
games and programs a/c Sonic 401 80 plus
bronze power supply and an NZXT s340
case for a solid airflow clean looks and
great price which leads us to the last
key component for any gaming rig the
graphics card
we chose the Radeon r9 285 because at
under 250 bucks with some available for
as little as like 200 and change on
promo it stays within that FPS per
dollar sweet spot that usually exists
between about 120 to 280 dollars and it
also has at least we were hoping when we
spec to this thing and not horsepower
for the games that we're going to be
running on this rig with graphics
settings turned up even at 4k so here's
the finished build and with it done it's
time to benchmark all the games for me
and by me I mean Luke and by all the
games I mean we took anything that had
over 10,000 viewers on twitch TV so like
the mainstream and competitive stuff
added in a couple choices of our
own fired it up at 4k on an Acer b3 26
HK a gorgeous IPS monitor and crank the
details to see how they would run and
actually the results surprised me a
little bit across our test suite of dirt
showdown Starcraft 2 Team Fortress 2
Counter Strike global Offensive League
of Legends dota 2 and Wow
only world of warcraft likely thanks to
its recent graphical update with
warlords of draenor neither the details
turned down at all in order to spit out
not just playable but actually very
enjoyable frame rates at a massive 3840
by 2160 resolution now this won't be the
case across the board we didn't make a
magical computer here if you're going to
grab the latest triple-a Ong
photorealism titles from a series like
assassin's creed battlefield crisis or
the like then you'll need to run at a
lower resolution and deal with the
interpolation that comes along with that
unless you want to step up to some
seriously more powerful hardware but not
everyone is interested in that and I was
still I don't know what the right word
is so I'll say amused when I realized
that the most popular games the gamers
are really spending the bulk of their
time on these days just aren't that
demanding and there's no reason that a
reasonable modern gaming rig can't run
them pranked on a 4k monitor today so
thanks AMD for sponsoring this fun
little build blog and experiment thanks
to you guys for watching like this video
if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked as always check out
the links in the video description to
support us you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one you can give us a monthly
contribution or you can change your
amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate code so whenever you buy CPUs
graphics cards motherboards heat sinks
as as these or whatever else we get a
small kickback that kind of thing helps
us out a lot thanks again for watching
and as always don't forget to subscribe
