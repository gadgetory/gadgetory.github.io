CES 2017 check them out and the link
down below alright guys we are here at
Thermaltake checking out two very
interesting things at least to me the
first one is RGB fittings
these weren't announced at CES they've
been around for about three or four
months I believe but I haven't seen them
yet this is my first time and they are
beautiful my favorite implementation of
them is what they have clear water I'm
sure you guys see that on screen right
now it looks amazing I love actually how
it fades out as it goes through the tube
it makes for a very unique effect when
you're pairing it with like hardline
tubing where you already have huge
amounts of customization in terms of
like how you bend it and all that kind
of stuff you could really make your
build your own which i think is super
cool
it comes with eight LEDs inside of each
fitting and they obviously have to be
plugged in because they light up they go
to a controller which can change the
brightness it can change the color out
of seven different colors and it can
change to a custom mode where it like
breathes through all of the different
colors which is probably my favorite
mode as of right now they just come in
black but this is Gen one and I think
they're super cool so you want to check
them out they're on amazon new egg
thermal takes website all that kind of
stuff
scrolling back here however is something
that's a little bit true to my personal
heart i like a iOS and i like three by
120 a iOS and there are not very many of
them if you watch the last compensator i
used the same one as the previous time
because I thought the block was fairly
attractive and I believe in that video
thermal mic might get a little bit upset
right now I rag Don thermal tape because
I did not like the block that they had
for their 3 by 120 all-in-one cooler it
says so many different things and
there's so many different logos there's
this like uppercase T lowercase T
wrapped in like this crazy aggressive
gear and then it says like thermaltake
cool your life and then there's like
water 3.0 and it's in this weird font
anyways now they have this thing which
is beautiful there's just two very
nicely stylized T's and a ring around it
and our jeebies that's that's all that's
all I want
that's I just minimalistic logo with
some RGB lighting so I can customize
what shows up it comes with three of
their ring plus generation 3 fans so
they have 12 hour GB LED
you can control them through the app on
your computer or eventually you'll be
able to control them through an app on
your phone and they have tons of
dominant even go through them all
because there's way too many tons of
different options for how you can set up
how the different RG bees work and they
all sync together and they just look
fantastic
so if you wanted a three by 120 cooler
and have been a little bit frustrated
because there isn't a ton of them on the
market this is here now also I would
suggest if you're interested in the
block design and you either like it or
dislike it and want a different one hit
them up on Twitter because it is not
completely finalized and they're taking
feedback all right guys thank you for
watching remember to hit them up on
Twitter if you have another idea for the
design of the top of their water block
or some feedback in any other realm they
actually will pay attention which is
pretty cool hit us up in the comments
down below let me know what you think
about like the RGB fittings or the new
design for their block which I like a
lot and thank you to dear Anne for
