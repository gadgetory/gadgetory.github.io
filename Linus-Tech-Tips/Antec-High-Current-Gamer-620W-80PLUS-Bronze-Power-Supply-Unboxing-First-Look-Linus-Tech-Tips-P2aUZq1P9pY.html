brand new product line from Antec this
is their high current gamer series and I
have the 620 watt power supply I
actually don't even have all the details
about the other products in this line
but let's say it's going to be like a
huge refresh and this high current
series is going to be really big moving
forward so this particular unit as you
might have already guessed is a 620 watt
unit
it features 80 plus bronze certification
which is pretty good for a mainstream
power supply and then over here we will
find a bunch of other bullet points
about this unit so it is rated in
continuous power like all ntek power
supplies that means your 620 watt is not
peak it's not under ideal low
temperature conditions
that's your continuous power that it can
provide it has 6/8 so that is six plus
two pin PCI Express graphics card
capability industrial-grade protections
that's your OCPs
and other protection to make sure that
it doesn't short out it doesn't burn
anything out if it's drawing too much
power somehow so here we go here we go
here we go over current protection over
voltage protection short-circuit
protection as well as over power
protection all Japanese brand capacitors
you've got a 130 millimeter dual ball
bearing fan so that's for better
reliability and this is dirt to get this
thing open this is something I've
actually like I really like its it
encourages me about the future but
eco-friendly packaging and this is
actually really smart it's not just a
matter of we took like some cardboard
and like put it around it this is smart
so they've actually got interlocking
pieces of cardboard you can see that
this is dual dual wall cardboard so this
stuff is stiff I mean you know what this
is a sample I actually have to get back
and effects visiting but I'm just gonna
break it anyway look at that that's the
kind of impact it takes to break this
piece and you can see even on the other
side I didn't make it all the way
through if I want to break through two
of them okay so I've broken the top one
I didn't even make it to the second one
not to mention you've got your outer
carton box so that's that's how strong
it is and it's 900 percent recyclable
which is pretty cool we've got a power
cord and then we have the power supply
unit open up we got screwed
and then we have the power supply unit
itself and what they need they talk
everything look at that there's a little
spot in the back for the switch so it
doesn't get any pressure on it during
shipping so that's how the whole thing
goes together very smart sorry I know
you know you opened enough boxes and you
start to kind of gush about smart
packaging I know it's pathetic
okay here we go so this is the high
current 620 watt it comes in a nice
little bag which according to an tech
all of the packaging is recyclable so
I'm assuming the bag can be recycled
somehow as well believe it appears to be
one of those like like sort of quality
paper bags I don't think it's actually
got any plastic in it just get this I'm
done so let's have a look at the
connectors first by the way I think I
usually do connectors laughs but we're
gonna mix things up a little bit so we
got our 24 pin power connector which is
fully sleeved all the way into the
housing okay so that is a twenty plus
four so you can remove those four pins
if you're running a very old motherboard
or mini ITX port for that matter we've
got a four plus four pin CPU power
connector we don't have two of those
remember this is still a mainstream
product so it's four so while it may be
targeted at gamers it's not necessarily
targeted at gamers who are using a EVGA
sr2 motherboard with dual Zeon's and
quad a graphics card so you shouldn't be
running a 620 watt power supply anyway
if that's the case we've got two PCI
Express six plus two pins so depending
how the PCI Express standards go and
upcoming graphics card you can support
do a six pin a six plus 8 or even dual
eight pin PCI Express let's have a look
here at what we've got in terms of
peripheral expansion so let's look at
all X first we've got two individual
wires so these each feature three molex
connectors and then the other one
features one lone floppy connector in
case you do still need a floppy drive
for some reason and then we have six
SATA connectors and those are on two
separates so what you can do is you can
run this one up to your optical drives
you can run the other one down to your
hard drives and SSDs and call it a day
paint finish on
quite nice it's not glossy so it's not
gonna be a total fingerprint magnet you
can clearly see that here and the
overall look at the power supply is
pretty nice actually there you go so you
got some antec branding on the side a
nice little sticker we've got an ant X
stamp on the side of it as well
just talks a little bit about what it is
620 watt continuous power it's actually
kind of a nice looking fan that's one
two three it's a nine bladed fan I can't
see any really anything really about it
there's nothing on the hub but you know
sometimes you can tell just looking at a
fan if it's really cheap like humans to
see the blades are nice and thick all
that stuff and intact design continuous
power since 1986 so the company's about
as long as I am and here we go specs so
those are on the top of the unit we can
provide up to 48 amps on the single 12
volt rail so you can see there is only
one 12 volt rail here and it doesn't
really say a whole lot else about it
here aha there we go maximum 12 volt
load is 576 watts you can provide the
majority but not quite all of the power
from this PSU on the 12 volt rail let's
go and have a look we saw the front so
let's just look at the back of the unit
before we wrap this up we got a power
switch as well as a plug for your power
and that pretty much does it thank you
for checking out my unboxing Oh show
this side of the box okay so this is the
high current gamer series and they're
talking a little bit about what it takes
to make that fan ramped up so here's a
little graph of how much load there is
on the power supply versus how much rpm
you know I always talk about how you
should use a power supply that's gonna
provide you know 50% to 60% load to your
system under load so that means with
this power supply if your system draws
under load above 350 Watts to 375 Watts
from the wall this fan is never going to
ramp up it's going to be super silent
and you're gonna be really happy as soon
as you get up to you know 75 percent or
so load well then you're going to start
seeing a thousand to thirteen hundred
rpms it might get a little bit loud but
it can handle it it's fully capable of
it so that's a pretty good little graph
to refer to that was all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
