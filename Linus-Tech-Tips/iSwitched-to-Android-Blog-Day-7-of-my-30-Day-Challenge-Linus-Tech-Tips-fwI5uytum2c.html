mobile Coolermaster usa.com welcome to
day seven of my experience with the HTC
one so this is my first time taking a
long-term crack at Android and I got to
say the experience has been very
positive so far so I'm gonna start with
the stock Gmail app which I absolutely
love
it allows you to easily and quickly
switch between all of your different
inboxes and it allows you to manage it
through the notification screen to sort
of navigate to each one individually
it's very very seamless and speaking of
seamless just I mean obviously it's a
google OS so it's very well integrated
as far as google stuff goes but YouTube
is a fantastic experience compared to
here I'm just going to go back to the
very beginning
compared to other platforms so you can
see if I'm not signed in to a particular
YouTube account then all I have to do if
I want to upload something is I go on I
find something so in this case maybe
there's a video tour of my motorbike
which I am planning to sell on
Craigslist and I go okay I want to share
this all I have to do is go oh look at
that YouTube is in my top options now
that I've done it a few times I can pick
which one I want to throw that online as
cat tips I select it I press upload and
it is ready to go it is very very
seamless once you're logged into YouTube
you can see him
do-do-do-do-do trending see I'm logged
in now all of your uploads playlist
favorites and all of that good stuff so
I just love the way that it's really
well integrated I'm tempted to start
vlogging based on how easy it is to just
sort of take a video I mean it's 1080p
it's extremely good quality I'm really
enjoying this phone it has a 1080p front
camera as well and just how quickly I
can upload it whether I'm on mobile or
whether I'm on Wi-Fi is absolutely great
automatic synchronization of all of my
junk made switching extremely easy so
all of my contacts were synced no
problem I also I never dial any other
way now this is amazing sifting through
your contacts list is just stupid
compared to this so check this out all I
have to do is go slack so I start there
you go so I start typing and it finds
the right person and just in case it's
not the right person all you have to do
is hold it down
and it will give you the options of all
the different people so in this case
it's just multiple entries for slick so
there's a whatsapp entry and then I
think one other one so absolutely
awesome I love Swift key so I'm using a
hold on I'm using a 30-day trial of
Swift key so let's go ahead we'll just
go go right here
it's just much snappier much more
responsive than the stock keyboard
there's no weird sort of delay as the
letter pops up showing you what you
press the predictive text is amazing
within a couple times of typing out
things like Linus tech tips it had
learned it it was suggesting it for me a
plus for SwiftKey definitely worth the
$2 or $3 or whatever they're charging
for it on google play power toggles is
another great one one of the first
things I complained about with this
particular phone running Sense 5.0 is
that I didn't have a quick way to turn
an auto rotate on and off oh well now I
do so I mean this is this is the
strength of Android if you don't like
something about it and there were things
I didn't like on day one the odds are
excellent that there's a way to fix it
power toggles also addressed my distress
that I couldn't see the the battery
meter with a more exact percentage based
readout boom power toggles adds a little
battery meter you can customize it you
can decide which things you want here so
I went with data rotations
synchronization Wi-Fi flash yeah you
don't need a don't need a flashlight app
anymore I can just scroll down from the
lock screen and I'm ready to go GPS and
Bluetooth so that does absolutely
everything I needed to do which is great
sliding notifications away without
actually open anything is a relief from
iOS this worked on Windows Phone as well
but it offline on skype apparently but
that's extremely handy and now that I'm
used to the multitasking interface I use
it all the time
so a double tap on home gives me all of
the things that I've used recently and I
mean it'll even do things like pause a
video that I was in the middle of which
exiting the app and reopening it doesn't
necessarily do so for example omit the
app that I use for video playback there
you go sure so something like that if I
just go like this I can go okay I need
to reply to I don't know an email really
quick blah blah blah blah blah YouTube
service something something and back to
my video and I'm ready to go so it's
very very fast it took me maybe a day or
two to actually
get used to but now I'm using it every
time pretty much um I still don't really
care for blinkfeed very much I'm more of
a producer than a consumer of sort of
Facebook Linkedin this kind of social
media stuff so I'm not finding this that
useful for myself but I can see how if
you didn't have such a busy feed it
might work pretty well for you so it's
the same reason I didn't end up using
the people app on Windows Phone 8 I'm
not saying it's a bad thing it's just
not necessarily for me and speaking of
other things that are unique to sense
5.0 I'm not sure whether I prefer the
more traditional Android side to side
scrolling or the more honey art and
rather honeycomb the more gingerbread
style up and down
I find myself actually using this one a
fair bit and once I figured out that all
you have to do is go in here and manage
your grid size so you can add more icons
to the screen it's actually not a lot of
scrolling even compared to this side by
side you can see I haven't properly
arranged everything in folders yet these
are still a lot of the stock folders but
I've been super super busy so yeah there
you go
another multitasking thing that I
absolutely love is Chrome's tab
switching so compared to any other
mobile OS that I've used this is
outstanding
and then if you're switching between two
tabs quickly you can actually do it
quickly you just swipe from the side and
boom you're on mobile YouTube
boom you're back on a social blade boom
you're back on mobile YouTube looking at
a completely different mobile YouTube
your own your own live stream archive if
your narcissistic like that I want to
get into the phone itself a little bit
because the HTC One really is a unique
piece of hardware I did drop it already
which was extremely distressing so I was
running to get something that was
overflowing in the kitchen and I was
like Google put it in my pocket fell on
the ground so it actually fell from
pocket height which fortunately for
short people like me isn't that high to
the tile floor and there's a dent where
is it nope can't find it there it is so
there's a dent right here you can
probably actually see it a little bit
better from this angle where this corner
is kind of flat now and then there's
another small dent and I think it's the
opposite corner right there so it did
survive it didn't crack the fact that
the edge you can see it's actually a
little bit wider at the butt come
to the screen is that's probably helpful
for protecting it from a fall I mean if
you dropped it straight flat on its
glass like they did in that one drop
test on YouTube then yeah obviously the
screen is gonna break but if it were to
hit at any kind of an angle it would
have to be a pretty extreme angle for it
to contact the glass first so I don't
know whether HTC thought of that or
whether the curve is so that it fits
more naturally in your hand but there
you go either way that's a intentional
or unintentional benefit speaking of the
curvature in spite of its 4.7 inch
screen I have found that I am actually
able to type one-handed it's not that
easy see it's not that easy
but compared to the 8x I can reach and
since doesn't want anyway
so since SwiftKey does a lot of the work
for me anyway that helps a lot you can
see in my Twitter feed there's this is
uh this is some scary game streamer that
I follow it's a pretty scary tattoo that
she's got going on there anyway
doo-doo-doo ah okay if I had to come up
with one complaint about the phone it
would be that the lock button on the top
looks an awful lot like the microUSB
port here and they're in the same
proportion so if you were pulling it out
of your pocket think about it this way
if you're pulling it out of your pocket
and you want to know the orientation of
the phone at first glance that could
just as easily be your lock button as
this yeah so I've had to I mean okay
very minor complaint but I've had to get
in the habit of putting my phone in 1/8
way and pulling it out the same way so
that I know where my lock button is but
there you Gilman's voice quality on my
end I would describe as outstanding
maybe a little bit better than the 8x
whereas people on the other side are
anecdotally describing it to me as
pretty good so take take what you will
out of that so that's my my feedback on
the speaker and the microphone I decided
to do a bit of a stress test on the
battery now HTC wanted me to talk about
their battery bar which is a six
thousand milliamp hour little it's one
of those little USB charge things so you
can carry around a little bit of extra
battery capacity with you but what I
found is I actually didn't really end up
having a desire to use it because my
torture test that I did on day two
involved six hours six
Plus on being conservative six hours of
playing music on the phone had a
reasonable volume so I was sitting
working on my computer I had it next to
me playing back music so six hours of
that two hours of streaming video with
Amit so bearing in mind most of the
processing is being done by my home
server not by the phone itself but
either way we are being pretty heavy on
the Wi-Fi and then another two hours of
listening to music on headphones with a
few calls not a ton of calls that day
but regular Twitter as well as regular
emails on the phone and I had 35 percent
battery left at the end of the day this
is with automatic screen brightness and
I'm not using the power saving mode I
haven't turned off Bluetooth I haven't
really engaged any tricks or any of
those battery saving apps to help me
save more power so I'm extremely
impressed and it's sort of brought to my
attention that not all X milliamp hour
batteries are created equal
Slick's Galaxy s3 he having only owned
it for I think less than six months
already doesn't make it through a single
day on a charge like at all in fact he
sent me sort of an amusing screenshot of
how how ludicrous it's gotten over time
and I mean remember guys the thing about
a battery is that here let me just find
this Cara I can't find it but he sent me
a really funny screenshot of his phone
saying 25% battery left five minutes
remaining that's a little extreme it
does last longer than that but it's been
pretty unsatisfactory for him so I'm
really interested to see how this lasts
over the longer term because when you
compare it to the galaxy s3 at least you
can replace the battery on the s3
whereas this one you have to rely on the
battery inside being very high quality I
mean my iPhone 4 still lasts me an
entire day even though it's three years
old because at least the integrated
battery that you can't change doesn't
have a horrible memory effect that
causes the battery life to go down
dramatically
anyway I'm pleased for now
auto-brightness has handled extremely
well to the point where I've actually
left it on any phones I've had in the
past I've never left auto brightness on
because I find it drains the battery too
fast but it's pretty smart so if you
cover up the light sensor it's going to
go ahead and dim itself pretty quickly
and it'll dim itself like right way all
the way down to the point where it's not
uncomfortable I find if you're like in
bed watching a video
and it doesn't dim it enough it's just
kind of glaring and uncomfortable in
your eyes and it actually takes it down
to a to a good level so it's very
readable in the day as well.i heats up
when I hammer it with tethering but I
think that goes for most phones pretty
much at all because you are stressing
both the Wi-Fi and the the mobile data
chipsets and the antennas and
everything's just kind of going crazy in
there but we didn't see any kind of
weird performance issues or anything
like that unlike my iPhone 4 which
worked with tethering maybe half of the
time and with half of the devices we had
a couple notebooks and at least one
other phone tethered to it all at the
same time so I think that pretty much
covers it this is day 7 of my Android I
switched and I'm ruining the conclusion
again but I think I'm pretty much gonna
be sticking with Android and I'm pretty
much gonna be sticking with this phone
unless you guys really want me to try
out another platform like maybe
blackberry or a bun too and then maybe
I'll do a 30 day switch to that but in
all likelihood I see myself going back
to Android for the main reasons being
app available 'ti you can find an app
for almost anything as well as the easy
integration with services that I use
extensively like Gmail and YouTube
