get our ideas from where do we get the
products that we make videos about well
today I'm going to be giving you guys
some insight welcome to a new segment
we're going to be calling the mailroom
not because you have to be male and not
because it's necessarily a room it's
more of an area
Colonel bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you browse the
Internet as though you're in one of 20
different countries check out the link
in the video description to try it now
for free
first up the prodigal son has returned
the seven gamers one CPU rig is back
from our bros who helpfully put this
made in Canada sign on it these are the
BS mods guys and who also no way oh wow
oh wow oh wow shots shots fired you guys
shots fired
so we're gonna be challenging them to
either a tech showdown or a scrapyard
war sometime soon and it's on it's on
next up is some pretty boring stuff so
this is apparently 40 yards of 50 yards
of medical No a hundred yards of medical
tape this box right here actually just
arrived this is all the unsold
merchandise from our district lines
t-shirt store and you can tell which was
the least popular of all the designs
we've ever done Edsel I personally think
it's adorable but Masters of the
Universe was not a top-selling design
for us so we're gonna have to find
something to do with those oh we just
got our sample of the G for Tim spectrum
so that was sent to us by Logitech as
well as the Corsair carbide 400 C and
this actually this is this is
interesting this is a shadow box for
mounting like a sports Jersey or
something my wife intends to put her old
pharmacy lab coat as kind of like a
harkening back to the good old days
before she had to work with me all the
time type thing can get these pretty
cheap on eBay alright this next item is
one
that I have absolutely no idea what's
inside I think someone else took a peek
at it but this was sent by LG and they
actually asked me at CES if I had opened
it and I kind of splint yeah I know I've
had that for weeks but no I have not
opened it yet because I haven't had time
Happy New Year Linus do you have any
exciting plans at the beginning of the
year
how about experiencing your favorites
like new you are now the star of the
movie Yvonne - may the force be with you
what
that's cryptic we've got a container
marked - Sebastian Wow that is um that
is uh Wow the Hat is a thing
no I think the bases are aluminum Halon
so um
check this out LG got us a gift
it's like Han Solo and Princess Leia
action figures with the catch being that
they put your face on Princess Leia and
mine on Han Solo so uh carry your Han
Solo solo okay don't really have a
choice looks a lot taller at that
actually no if we stand next to each
other we're pretty much the same page
good okay and there's a gift inside
your favorite movies yes well my
favorite movies lettuce just made me
watch all of them in the last month I
think before we go and see the new one
hey do you want to
wow so many but we haven't watched all
these bonus disc features yeah look at
all of those it's like we didn't do a
sweater not trying on that is actually
creepily like similar
okay let's go back to the mailroom oh
okay I'm a little jelly above that well
I think we all know what the appropriate
thing to do would be we need the rest of
the cast I want him as greedy haha
I know Chewbacca I'm super down with you
Bob doesn t like PS Maj is all like I'll
talk and smack
LG's all like yo here's like weirdest
coolest thing ever back to the mailroom
so this is a 800 watt redundant power
supply that I ordered for one of our
servers this is a box from NZXT now I
have no idea what's inside looks like
Kraken x61 this is embarrassing this is
like a modular headphone system with a
bunch of different headbands and cables
and ear cups that I've had for literally
months this is net gears 28 port 10
gigabit switch which I'm super stoked to
upgrade the server room with now I can
do some trunking and link aggregation
here's a couple letters maybe fan mail
i phone parts oh the new home button for
my iPhone 4 this is care of ms sm and
it's handwritten
dear mr. Sebastian my name is Ian einem
I'm a freshman at the main school of
science and mathematics the purpose of
this letter is a huge thank you about a
year ago I was bombing around YouTube
when I came across one of your videos I
became hooked from then on my life has
revolved around the amazing world that
is modern technology everything I have
learned has come from one of your videos
however there's more to it than that all
of these in videos inspired me to focus
harder on my schoolwork they even helped
motivate me to apply here at MSS M I
began to be more driven and the things
that I enjoyed and in experiencing what
I had when it came time to build my
gaming system your archive of videos had
all the answers though not an insane
system gtx 960 8 gigs ram i5 4460 it
showed me that I could do anything if I
just could do anything it just would not
have happened if not for your videos
even though I'm only 15 I started a
small computer repair business and build
epic custom systems once again I owe it
all to you sincerely Ian PS I vote
turnip that is so charming well thank
you Ian it's always nice to to hear from
people that what we do is more than just
sort of making a video sometimes here
this is funny ha this is all the
Sennheiser gear that was supposed to
appear in the music video for our
Christmas album but that we ended up
just using the microphone behind the
scenes to record so thank you Sennheiser
for providing those we're gonna send
them back anyway like it's not a big
deal it's just yeah we'd never even open
the box Oh awesome first is some a new
cable for my IE 80s really need that
along with that iPhone 4 button
this is cool this is I think this is for
like a sponsor spot or something but
this is a Pacers world's first dual
interphase SSD open so basically it has
a SATA interface on the one side and
then it has USB three types II on the
other side
and then over here is finally the
world's largest mousepad we were kind of
thinking of doing like another holy
episode around this let us know in the
comments if you'd like to see us show
off the the pad Zilla here oh yeah and
this is the toilet paper that we so
desperately need ten guys in a building
seems a lot better
speaking of whatever it is I was talking
about ting calm ting is the mobile
carrier that makes sense and it's funny
because sense can be like sense like in
your head and it can also be sensed like
in your pocket they bill you only for
what you use and the whole thing is
totally transparent so if you're like
gee I wonder if King would be a good fit
for me all you have to do is head over
to their website which you can visit at
Linus ENCOM we have that linked in the
video description and try out their
savings calculator today you enter your
last few bills you know the ones where
you have to sort of look into your
crystal ball and figure out how many
text messages you're going to send and
then you look at your actual usage and
you find out if ting would save you
money and from the last numbers that
I've seen it was something ridiculous
like high 90% of people would save money
by switching to ting and there's other
advantages too if you call them you
actually talk to a person I have
personally tested this there you don't
get put through to an automated system
or anything like that you call them
someones like hello and you're like what
hello I would like today it actually
works it's pretty crazy so the cool
thing is if you head over to the savings
calculator and it looks like it's going
to work by using our link you can get 25
bucks off of a new device or as a
service credit pretty cool stuff so
thanks for watching guys if you enjoyed
our mail room tour of kind of what shows
up here on a daily or weekly or some of
the stuff
sitting here for a long time basis then
it'll hit a like if you didn't like it
though hit the dislike button I've done
my outro out of order now so something

the oculus rift based on what we saw at
CES this year so check that video out at
the little eye in the corner up there if
