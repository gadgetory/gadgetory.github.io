11 results with the GTX 560 hawk
featuring the Twin Frozr three cooler
Twin Frozr 3 there's the logo thing so
that's with the dual 80 mil fans you can
see the hawk logo and the PCB down there
there it is alright MSI hot ok so
basically the max overclock I was able
to achieve on this particular card you
may use my manual brightness settings
area you can actually read that now so I
was able to turn up not only the core
voltage but also the memory voltage and
auxilary voltage because of the
non-reference Hawk PCB so I was able to
get my core clock up past 1 gigahertz
now I was able to run benchmarks higher
than this up to about 1.05 gigahertz but
this was what I found to be 24/7 stable
okay without temperature's going through
the roof ah you can't see it here around
the benchmark a while ago but it peaks
at around 70 degrees
okay shader clock is obviously locked in
the core clock as with most recent
generation Nvidia cards memory clock you
know what doesn't have a huge impact on
performance but this is as high as I was
able to get stable like I said very
little impact on performance though it's
all about the core clock on this
particular card so now what I'm gonna do
is I actually never even rammed the
benchmark at the reference clock speeds
so I will go ahead and run it at
reference clock speeds which actually
aren't that much lower
remember this card is overclocked to 950
megahertz out of the box and I will find
out how much of a performance
improvement we got from overclocking the
graphics card ok so there's clearly not
much improvement in performance to be
had by overclocking the GTX 560 Hawke
Edition card from MSI but there are
definitely some advantages to it so
there's the fact that it doesn't cost
that much more than the regular gtx 560
Twin Frozr - there's also the fact that
it has a better PCB which includes I
mean among other things ok we've got the
V checkpoints which are here we've also
got the where is it
what is this them oh yeah we've got the
different profiles for the fans so you
can go to performance motor silent mode
for the fans we've got this rigidity
plate for the PCB itself to keep it from
flexing when it's installed in your case
which the regular twin frozer 2 does not
one of the other improvements they made
to the PCB design is also the fact that
the PCIe plugs come out the top of the
part rather than the back of the card
which means that the overall length of
it is a little bit less you can see the
Twin Frozr to row it fell that's no good
overhangs the PCB a little bit whereas
here it does not this one froze r3 does
not do that you get the propeller style
fans rather than the more traditional
blade fans and yeah and then you get the
factory overclock so since you can't
push it that much over the factory
overclock that's pretty much to be
expected we're pretty close to the
limits of a GTX 560 GPU you still get
that factory overclock which is
significantly more than the 560 Ti Twin
Frozr 2 which in spite of the covered up
Hawk that's not down there on the PCB
because it's the same PCB as the GTX 460
Hawk this is a true 560 Hawk not just
with a twin frozer cooler on it so thank
you for checking out my little
overclocking adventure on the GTX 560
