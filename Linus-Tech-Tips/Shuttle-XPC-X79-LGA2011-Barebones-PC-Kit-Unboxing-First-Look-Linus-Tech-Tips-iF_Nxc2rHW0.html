I think is freaking fantastic shuttle
has for the longest time actually I
don't know how long they've been
building mini pcs but they're darn good
at it and they their big thing is more
performance in a smaller space and I
think they've really outdone themselves
this time and I don't want it I don't
want to give away what this is yet
so let me just do this I'm actually
going to save the suspense that is if
you guys haven't figured out to just
look at the title of the video at this
point I know right
I'm going to save the suspense of what
exactly this thing is until we've
actually opened up the bare-bones PC
unit all the way because this is the
most performance you are going to fit in
a form factor like this yeah okay so
just for comparison here's the iPhone 4
against the shuttle to show the size of
this reverse monstrosity that is the
opposite of a monstrosity lilliputian
proportions haha see who can pull the
literary terms now BAM
so there is my iPhone I'm not relevant I
know okay hold on hold on we'll cover
the exterior first the exterior first up
we got our five and a quarter inch bay
going on here so this hooks up fairly
easily I've actually done one of these
recently that use the same mechanism
took me a couple minutes of like you
know kid jiggering with it to get it
going alright here is a three and a half
inch front panel so if you want to put
in a card reader something along those
lines you got your power switch your
hard drive indicator LED as well as your
front panel connectors including two USB
three two USB two headphones and
microphone
you got some ventilation going on you
got some ventilation going on over here
you got some ventilation going on over
here that's a 92 millimeter cooling fan
attached to a 92 millimeter heatsink
irradiator you kind of looking thing
a bunch of heat pipes going through it
you got your included 500 watt 80 plus
80 plus bronze I believe let me double
check that one no don't look don't look
over here this is all a secret 80 plus
bronze 500 watt power supply oh good
work okay
this is kind of hilarious so there's two
more USB 3 ports eSATA power so we're
going to have to figure out exactly what
that's all about
eSATA as well as USB ie SATA you 2 more
USB 2 2 more it's six total USB 2 clear
CMOS dual LAN as well as your 7.1 audio
out and optical audio out so if you guys
can already see this is a unique and
very high-end X PC I already took out
the thumb screws guys it didn't just
fall apart
randomly fail ok I included accessories
include a power cord and a quick a guide
which is in color and English even she's
good if you're me you speak English ah
here's what it is that was easily
answered so hold on I'm gonna no I can't
take this off yet I can't unveil it yet
ok so that goes there and this is
actually the coolest thing that I've
seen included on a case or on a
motherboard rather in quite a long time
so it's an external state of power look
at that so that way if you have because
this isn't because eSATA is pretty
inconvenient to run off of a bear drive
which is what I use it for most of the
time unless you have an auxilary power
somewhere look at this they just include
that little adapter for you and then you
just have to have a regular non powered
normal like eSATA cable that is actually
fantastic I think slick can agree with
me on this one he says yes excellent so
I'm not just crazy that's it thank who
does that that's cool ok also included
are a couple of regular SATA cables some
thermal compound the driver CD which you
shouldn't use as well as some
installation screws and zip ties all
right now removing the cover BAM check
this out
so inside actually just have to say
alright so taking this apart there's our
5 and a quarter inch drive mount there's
our two three and a half inch drive
mounts okay there's the drive cage that
goes with them drive screw holes and
there we have it yes this is a full
fledged x79 bare-bones system inside a
shuttle form factor so what is all of
that mean that means that performance
per cubic foot this takes the cake so
there is the 80 plus bronze 500 watt
power supply that makes it all possible
but why does 500 watts isn't nearly
enough for next time against actually it
is it definitely is 500 watts is going
to be plenty for an X 79 system with one
very high powered graphics card which
due to the limited number of slots
available is pretty much all you're
going to be putting in here although I
mean if you've our water cooling and you
do want to find single slot back plates
you could in theory plug in two to
reasonably you know not quite highest
power graphics card but to reasonably
high draw graphics cards because it does
have dual PCIe 16x slots so that's
pretty cool it's in there alright it's
in there guys
we've also got um hold on a second
between two these plug in hold on aha
yep we've got the mSATA supporting
spot right here for adding a small SSD a
small M SATA SSD as well as mini PCIe so
that you can add some kind of other
add-in card with so yes you don't have
the option to mini add-in cards here
once you put in a high power graphics
card that's going to take up your two
slots but you can add a couple more
other things here quad channel RAM is
provided in the form of four dimm slots
on
either side of the CPU socket we've also
got SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports ah
you know what I actually can't tell
looking at them although if I had to
guess I'd say it's the two blue ones are
SATA 3 and the 2 orange ones are say 2
to 3 gigabit per second and over here ah
ok sorry guys I'm all excited about this
one this one it's getting there we go
there so there is our motherboard power
you can see they're using what appears
to be a somewhat proprietary looking
connector I mean is that is that really
a 20 pin power connector is this one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
so as slick pointed out to me while that
may be a 20 pin power connector next to
an 8 pin EPS power connector for the CPU
itself shuttle apparently just does as
they please because it has an eSATA
power connector coming right out the
back of the case so we are shuttle we do
what we want and that that's how we roll
is apparently their mantra which is cool
we've got what is for shuttle pretty
beefy pwm cooling which makes sense
because this is an LGA 2011 socket which
means that all of the CPUs that are
supported on this socket are 130 watt
processors so there's some serious power
to be delivered to the CPU the chipset
also has a cooler on it right there and
you can see that's probably going to get
some excess draft egde going on from the
CPU cooler that also cools the bulk of
the system because any other air that's
being carried out of the case is going
to be by this small 40mm fan on the
power supply itself USB 3 is covered by
and I love the way shuttle does all the
cable management for you pretty much I
mean look at this so here's all your
extra connectors I'll show you those in
a minute but USB 3 is done right here
you can install your memory right under
that's not going anywhere and then uh
here are is your front USB 2 as well as
your front panel audio none of this is
going to get in the way once you just
kind of route it a little bit like that
once you put your graphics card in there
okay let's go ahead and undo these so I
can show you guys
included power connectors so you've got
two SATA so that's for your two three
and a half inch drives two more SATA for
your five and a quarter inch drive and
maybe an SSD that you jam in there
somewhere
you got a couple molex connectors in
case you have some kind of use for those
and you still got a floppy connector
which yeah and then you've got a six
plus two pin as well as a six pin
so what kind of graphics card can you
put in here let's find out this wasn't
easy guys but check this out Radeon 7970
now I actually with have power efficient
the 7970 is I wouldn't be surprised at
all if this just worked without without
a hitch but there you go it physically
fits and we had to kind of cram it in
there but that's what it'll look like
will it get enough ventilation from here
so it'll actually exhaust air out the
back of the case with the blower cooler
and then it will intake air here from
here so that's how it'll get access to
fresh air will it be as quiet as if you
installed it in a full-size case no will
it work with the five hundred watt power
supply and a non overclock CPU in a non
overclocked graphics card guys this is
not for overclocking this is for stock
speed operation within small form-factor
yes very cool guys so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the shuttle x79 bare-bones PC
supporting up to 32 gigs of memory up to
two beast PCI Express 3.0 graphics cards
if you can you know put in like single
slot coolers which doesn't seem that
feasible I don't know where you put a
radiator in here for example die you
know it's just one of those things just
throwing it out there um up to a six
core processor and all within this tiny
tiny form factor don't forget to
