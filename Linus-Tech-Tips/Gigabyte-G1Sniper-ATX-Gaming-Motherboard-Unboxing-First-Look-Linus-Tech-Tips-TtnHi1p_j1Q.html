I was looking at the g1 sniper box
preparing to do my unboxing check this
out the boxes are actually patterned
identically so here it's probably easier
if I stack them save for the color so
every little like mark is exactly the
same on both boxes see like this mark in
this mark see so it's just a color
difference however there is more
difference between these two
motherboards than just the color so we
are going to be doing an unboxing of the
g1 sniper we've already done the g1
assassin and let's have a look at what
is special about this member of the
gigabyte g1 gaming series so it has a
three year warranty which we've come to
expect from gigabyte in the US and
Canada it has extreme fidelity XY 2 X 5
rather powered audio ok it supports the
latest Intel Core i7 processors on the
LGA 1366 platform that includes the 990
X Extreme Edition we've got powered by
creative audio including onboard
amplification as well as a killer a 2100
networking solution ok let's move around
to the back where there's a bunch of
stuff that really we're going to get
more into as we look at the board itself
so let's open up the box here when we
find some digicam and some flatulence ok
and there's the board itself we're not
going to look too closely at that yet
you're going to check out the
accessories so first thing we got here
is three dudes who are g1 killers we
have the I believe it's the assassin the
gorilla and the sniper ok then on the
back we have a target with some bullet
holes conveniently already in it next
yeah
stickers bullets bullet holes skull with
flames coming out of his eyes and a
knife and more bullets more bullet holes
and from g1 see these these two would
actually probably look pretty cool on
case the rest of them I don't know you
might just look like you live in Surrey
and you drive a truck okay here we go
users manual including a chipsets and
utilities DVD throw it away download the
latest off the gigabyte website
multilingual installation guidebook
okay we've got an i/o shield which is
not color coded but it is black so it
looks sweet we've also got a gigabyte
sticker yeah that sticker sucks compared
to the other ones
sorry gigabyte then we have Dolby
Digital home theater logo alright we've
got a front panel USB 3 which is pretty
nice ok using an internal header since
most cases don't have front USB 3 that's
that's a pretty good feature to have so
just mounts in a three and a half inch
Bay alright we've got an SLI bridge
3-way SLI bridge and we've got four SATA
cables so two of them are right angle
and two of them are straight okay I'm
just going to put this back in here bear
with me while I do some Reebok sing to
go with my unboxing and do you and that
will give me a convenient place to put
the motherboard while we talk about that
okay some other words the biggest
difference that I can see between the g1
assasin and the g1 sniper at first
glance anyhow is the form factor so the
g1 assassin uses that XL ATX form factor
which has nine expansion slots and only
fits in a handful of cases whereas the
g1 assassin seems to have a pretty
similar feature set but fit in a
standard ATX case oh it also only has
six expansion slots compared to the
seven expansion slot on the assassin
afforded by the longer form factor so
let's do sort of my standards feel where
we start in the middle where we've got
our LGA 1366 socket supporting four i7
core i7 extreme processors we've got our
four pin power connector up here in its
ideal location we've got sick
memory slots supporting triple channel
ddr3 memory we've got our 24 pin
connector and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge we have six SATA to
three gigabit per second ports and to
say two three six gigabit per second
ports and then we've got all of our
front panel connectors one of the things
that gigabyte has fixed about their g1
series boards as we move along we've got
USB - oh wow three USB 2's one USB three
front header and then we've also got our
audio header
look at that gigabyte is putting their
audio header in the correct location at
the very bottom left of the board unlike
some of their previous boards where it's
here and that's very difficult to get a
front panel cable over to alright we've
also got our expansion slots so we have
one two three PCIe 16x we have two PCIe
1x and one PCI based on the PCI are
based on the SLI bridge I saw included
it looks like the full-speed PCIe 16x
slots are actually going to be these two
and this last one runs at 8x as is
standard on x58 boards it's going to be
16 16 and 8 okay we've got cooling let's
talk cooling for a minute here so this
boys and girls is not a weapon it is a
heatsink and it cannot be assembled as a
firearm I have been notified that this
is not a clip based on my g1 assassin
unboxing actually this is a magazine so
my bad I don't know why crazy Russian
keeps moving the camera around so much
hold it still okay then we've got our
North Bridge heatsink not like that okay
which has LED lights on it which look
cool it also says gaming motherboard on
it and finally we have our MOSFET
heatsink which i think is actually the
coolest one because it's the barrel of a
gun check that out so you got your sight
there you got your barrel which will
have a bullet coming out of it probably
not because it's a heatsink not a weapon
bear that in mind folks okay you know
what let's not do the back i/o yeah
let's talk about the special features
that make G one special so here we have
all of the circuitry that is dedicated
to the onboard sound onboard sound is
something
that I really feel has gotten ignored
while we are innovating in so many other
ways on motherboards so this has a built
in amplifier which means that you can
run even high impedance headphones on
this motherboard and still get a
satisfactory listening experience okay
it also has as I said before dedicated
circuitry for the onboard sound that's
going to provide you with anytime you
have better quality components being
used for sound you're going to get a
better overall listening experience
better signal-to-noise ratio all of that
good stuff and up here we have the
killer which actually has dedicated RAM
as a cache and it is capable of
according to Bigfoot networks reducing
your overall latency and that is a good
thing now I don't care about that okay
what else do we have on here to talk
about oh yeah then control okay so we
got one two just back out and I'll point
out them one two three four
and I'm sure there's one more five fan
fan headers those are all four pin pwm
fan headers and they are conveniently
located where you actually might need
them unlike some motherboards so here's
your back fan here's your CPU fan here's
one two three that are kind of at the
front bottom so that should be pretty
handy and pretty usable compared to some
of the stuff I've seen in the past on
the back of the motherboard you can
clearly see the matte black PCB which I
have not harped on yet in this video
although I do talk about it every time I
see one because matte black PCBs are the
shizzle everything should have a matte
black PCB period okay we also have
screws on the back which I really like
to see not only screws but isolated
screws so they've got little washers
little plastic washers that will prevent
those from ever shorting out and causing
a problem with this motherboard the fact
that we're using screws also means that
cheap plastic pushpins can't pop out and
accidentally make it so that your MOSFET
cooler or your Northbridge cooler isn't
making proper contact anymore and not
cooling something properly so that is
just one of those nice little touches
that I do like to see finally it's the
let's have a look at the back panel
where we have two ps2 ports we've got
coaxial audio out we have an OC switch
okay so you know what give me a moment
I'm going to find out what that does
just wanted to correct myself really
quick because I think I okay clarify
myself really quick so when you're
running with two graphics cards these
are 16 X 16 X but it's not actually 16
16 8 it's when you're running with three
graphics cards it's going to be 16 8 and
8 ok guys so I'm clarifying that 16 16
or 16 8 8 so this one is capable of
doing either depending on the
configuration
so this OC labeled switch at the back is
according to the manual am an OC button
okay press this button to overclock your
cpu to return to the defaults press this
button again pretty self-explanatory all
right next we have 2 eSATA ports we have
4 USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0 ports and a
Gigabit Ethernet powered by killer 5.1
audio as well as optical audio out hold
on my bad 7.1 alright thanks guys for
