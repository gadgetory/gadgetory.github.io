marked the beginning of reasonably
priced 4k displays but while the Asus PB
287 q took an extra six weeks or so to
arrive I guess it goes to show what a
little bit more incubation time can do
for a product because this is one heck
of a monitor a global leader in tech
recruiting is celebrating geek pride by
giving away ten amazing tech prizes for
more info visit the modus Facebook page
or modus com this 28 inch display
actually uses the same panel as the
Samsung one that I just mentioned so
that means that yes it is 10 but with
its thousand to 1 contrast ratio and
support for 10-bit color using frame
rate control dithering it's one of the
best TN panels I've ever seen it is
still not IPs
so there's noticeable color and contrast
shift when looking from the top or
bottom and I even noticed a subtle color
shift with pure whites turning a bit
yellowish at the edges when using the
monitor normally but frankly it's the
kind of flaw you'll notice for a few
hours then completely forget about
unless you go looking for it once you're
actually using the thing let's just put
it this way a su thought it was good
enough to put their PB branding on it
and I agree with the decision that is to
say the monitor looks pretty darn good
but while it's a godsend for video and
photo editors who want to spread out all
their tools with all them pixels it's
not suitable for professional color work
the added TN benefits though of better
than average ghosting performance and
only around 11 milliseconds of total
display leg including input and pixel
response is a big bonus though for
gamers get ready for a beautiful gaming
experience with less than one frame of
total display leg another thing that
comes along with the PB branding is
robust build quality the bezel is
reasonably thin but much more
importantly it has a durable matte
finish hold on not that durable but but
durable so it won't get covered in
fingerprints then instantly get covered
in micro scratches when you try to wipe
them off compared to the Samsung value
4k asu's is offering is an
obvious bye for me for this reason alone
but it actually gets better but PB 287 Q
has 15 centimeters of height adjust a
hundred and twenty degrees of swivel 25
degrees of tilt and even 90 degree pivot
and if that isn't enough for you it has
a vase amount on the back so you can
mount it to a wall or a multi display
arm or whatever else you want and all of
that is without costing extra being able
to position the monitor correctly is not
only great for ergonomics but also for
countering the inherent TN viewing angle
limitations well done
a soos on the back behind the removable
cable cover will find power in an audio
input for the unexceptional built-in
speakers and a headphone pass through a
DisplayPort 1.2 input which supports 4k
at 60 Hertz with a single tile and by
the way the SLI issue with single tile
4k displays is now resolved as of today
and two HDMI inputs that are limited to
30 Hertz because HDMI is just too slow
for 60 Hertz
speaking of which for a laugh I ran this
monitor at 30 Hertz for the first two
days to see if I could get used to 30
Hertz I can't it's horrible
do yourself a favor and don't buy any of
the 4k monitors that run at 30 Hertz
it'll be fine for movies but it's just
not enough for gains or for me even
general desktop use where there are
simply better options available like
this one one interesting thing about the
HDMI inputs is that this monitor
supports picture in picture and picture
by picture if you really like having a
separate computer for things instead of
having another window running on the
device that you're already using for
some reason and it also supports MHL so
you can play content from your phone if
you feel like doing that neato now
before we dig through the otherwise
excellent on-screen controls I'd have
something to get off my back Asus this
rear mounted button nonsense is the
worst thing ever
LG's joystick is better been cues
capacitive buttons are better and heck
so is this
it's hard to figure out which button is
which without feeling out the entire row
or shifting my head to the right to
align it from straight on to clean yeah
please stop otherwise it's really
excellent this is splendid video modes
range from very useful with srgb being
my face
these days as a content creator but
standard also looking pretty good
all the way to totally useless with
reading mode being unfortunately
horrible but don't worry guys darkroom
mode is a good alternative it also
reduces the blue light output just like
reading mode but doesn't monkey around
with the sharpness so it looks quite a
bit better
the usual brightness contrast etc
options are in here and under image we
get some really cool stuff including
five levels of overdrive control and
four levels of sharpness enhancement
with the all-important off option
available for both of them very nice
under system setup you can dim the
backlight to save power turn off the
power LED lock the power button on
overlay a crosshair for noscoping all
them noobs and seriously though this is
basically cheating and no competition
will let you use it but I mean I guess
it's cool to have it on there and you
can change the display port mode from
1.1 to 1.2 which is basically the first
thing you should do when you get the
plotted her 1.1 doesn't support 4k at 60
Hertz now because I had a bit more time
with the PB 287 Q compared to Samsung's
offering I decided to try using it a few
different ways I already mentioned that
I tried it at 30 Hertz but what I also
tried was with a hundred and fifty
percent scaling and with no scaling at
all for a couple of days each and this
is where I feel like for the first time
in a while
the software guys Microsoft and
application developers have a lot of
work to do to catch up with the hardware
unscaled
the extra screen real estate is really
nice but it felt like I was doing it
when I exam the whole time because I was
straining a little bit and without LG's
handy virtual screen splitting app using
stock Windows multi window management
tools like arrow snap either gave me
tons of white space or didn't leverage
the extra pixels other than in
applications that support zooming really
nicely where the fonts look like really
great and really smooth
I'd recommend picking up something like
display fusion though so you can create
your own virtual desktops if you're
planning to use it unscaled but most
people won't want to anyway particularly
without vivid pixel which I bumped up to
25 to improve text sharpness a touch I
could use it but it just wasn't
comfortable like that and this
is the double-edged sword of a whopping
157 pixels per inch in supported
applications like games the image is so
crisp that you can't even really see
anti-aliasing beyond 2 to 4 X I mean man
it's beautiful so it hurts that much
more when you turn on scaling to 150
percent to make text sizes comfortable
but then many applications don't scale
correctly causing their text to be
blurry and crummy looking but when she
looks good man she looks good and the
applications that work correctly are
coming slowly but surely
now that the flood of 4k desktop and
other high-density displays has really
started picking up speed and truthfully
going with Windows 8.1 can actually help
with that already one of the you know
for some of the purists out there are a
few things that Windows 8.1 truly does
do better than previous operating
systems now one thing that actually
helped make the non scaled scenario
somewhat usable for me with this monitor
was the DC LED backlight versus the more
traditional PWM control that causes
subtle flickering at anything about a
hundred percent backlight I've only seen
this on a few monitors so far but it
really does make the display less tiring
to look at which for me means my vision
is less likely to blur as the day wears
on particularly when you're using very
large monitors I find my eyes do get
quite tired normally now the conclusion
for this product is pretty simple as
you'd expect it uses the same panel as
Samsung's offering which means it's good
enough for any general consumer but not
good enough for serious color work and
has some subtle but occasionally
noticeable inconsistency on uniform
light backgrounds but it has a very long
list of great features and improvements
over the Samsung model that earn it a
must buy rating for anyone looking for a
reasonably priced 4k monitor it's
flicker free backlight genuinely makes
it more comfortable for me to use than
PWM controlled monitors and at the same
price you get 60 Hertz support base a
mounting a solidly built ergonomic stand
with all the usual adjustments better
gaming performance and outstandingly
comprehensive on-screen display and a
three year warranty with one year of
zero brite coverage which is pretty
solid
not as
dell's three-year brite warranty but a
lot better than samsung's basic one-year
warranty so I feel like it's a really
well-balanced package so there you have
it
my feelings about 4k versus 3440 by 1440
21 by 9 monitors like the LG 34 um 95
haven't changed but right now the 34
year 95 is the only option available in
that form factor and while its IPs and I
prefer the lower pixel density its poor
included stand and input lag of around
17 to 25 milliseconds our definite point
against it not to mention it's much more
expensive so from the perspective of a
gamer or a value shopper who's looking
for an 8 megapixel 4k monitor this is it
folks it's time to go buy one speaking
of going and buying one do you have any
idea how long it took for my sales guy
to go by this fedora for me today the
stores like seven minutes away by Google
Maps and he was gone for an hour
apparently due to traffic although I
suspect he was probably goofing off but
none of that changes the fact that when
you run to the store for a quick errand
it always takes longer than you think
and that my friends is why we have
