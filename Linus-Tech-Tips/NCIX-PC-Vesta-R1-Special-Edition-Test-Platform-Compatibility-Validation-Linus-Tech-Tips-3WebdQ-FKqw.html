special edition red and black Corsair
650d cases the shop called this morning
to say they are not ready yet but
hopefully we'll be able to have access
to them tomorrow however what we do have
right now is our test platform running
so the overall spec of this machine is
going to be fairly evident at this point
we have the Radeon HD 6990 from XFX we
are going to be using a gigabyte p67
a ud7 and this is a b3 revision board so
that means that the theta2 controller
problem is fixed on this particular
motherboard we're going to be using a
Corsair performance 3 series SSD so
we're using the 128 gig as a boot drive
and then we're going to be using a 2
terabyte WD black hard drive for storage
we're going to be using the Corsair h74
cooling as well as corsair dominator GT
memory to fit the overall color scheme
which is going to be black red and with
a touch of gold because we're also using
a Corsair ax 850 power supply so you can
see we do have just a little bit of gold
on both that as well as the motherboard
itself so that's that's what we're going
for here we're gonna be using a blu-ray
writer we've got the special NCIX
Edition yeat lune red and black fans
that will be decking the system out in
this is a 2600 K processor down here I
think that's pretty much everything as
far as spectacle specs go now we will be
pre overclocking these systems so we're
expecting to get at least 4.4 to 4.6
gigahertz on the cpus for these special
edition systems and we are going to be
flipping the bios switch on the 6990 and
validating that every one of these
systems ships at eight hundred and
eighty megahertz which is the full
unlocked after you flip the awesome
switch on the 6990 of this car so you
got the best possible performance out of
it from that regard okay so we've got
our 3d mark 11 advanced edition score
that is in the extreme preset and that
is an ex 33 61 no score now
haven't actually overclocked the CPU yet
but we will be working on that shortly
and because I mean though the reality of
it is we can overclock with the stock
cooler so we're going to be doing that
once we've actually installed the
systems in the cases and I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say don't forget to subscribe to -
tech tips and stay tuned for more
updates on this exciting NCIX pc vesta
r1 system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
