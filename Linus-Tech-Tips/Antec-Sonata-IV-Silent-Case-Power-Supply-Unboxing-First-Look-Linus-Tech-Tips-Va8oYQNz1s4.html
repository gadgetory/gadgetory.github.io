product from an tech now the Sonata line
has been around since pretty much the
dawn of time as far as I can tell but it
has received some significant updates
since the original antic Sonata this is
the sonata for the is it is like its
predecessors a quiet mid tower case
elegantly silent they've added SSD hard
drive compatibility this is a quiet
computing product for man text which is
in line with the original concept for
the Sonata and is in my opinion what
makes the Sonata line so successful over
the long period of time that it has
existed so we're gonna start opening up
the box but we're also gonna have a look
at what an Tek has to say for themselves
in terms of spec so it can it has a
quiet 621 continuous power PSU so that
is higher than any previous Sonata line
although the Sonata other than the
sonata elite our Sonata proto rather the
Sonata line all comes with a power
supply but 620 watts is very generous
considering that it is so because this
is not sorry about the battery there
guess so because the Sonata has always
been kind of a value bang for the buck
line of products that's very generous it
has 80 plus certification now in terms
of drive bays we've got seven drive bays
three five and a quarter inch and four
three and a half inch seven expansion
slots which is ATX standard one rear 120
millimeter tri cool 3-speed fan and we
have front mounted USB 3.0 which is
pretty cool to see on a very mainstream
case like the Sonata series so let's we
got some foam here so you can see on
text using a very robust closed cell
phone they don't want your sonata for to
be damaged at any point shipping that
was very very close because I probably
should have dumped it out with the phone
rather than without it there's what's
left in the Box in case you guys were
wondering now let's see what the Sonata
4 looks like in person I did not have a
chance to visit an tech at the CES 2011
show so I actually have not seen this
case in person yet and it's upside down
so that remedy
okay so here we are with the traditional
ode I catch you there ok here we are
with the traditional piano black finish
now the last time I use the Sonata was
actually a sonata 2 so I'm going to be
telling you guys what improvements I see
based on that ancient case so we've got
thumb screws on both sides which means
that unlike the older older Sonata we
can actually remove both side panels
there we are so that allows for better
cable management as well as better
accessibility to things like hard drives
or whatever basically cable management
more than anything else let's see how
fingerprint-resistant this finishes so
unlike older Sonata style cases you can
see the fingerprints do leave a mark but
it's not quite as ugly as some of the
previous ones this is actually quite
fingerprint resistant considering
everything and let's see how easily they
wipe off once you've got something
smeared on there oh that's nice actually
that's really nice ok so here we've got
some ventilation on the side for your
drives and then cameraman wants to see
the inside so that's how it's mounted
just using little plastic clips ok so
side panels off so we're looking at the
back side you can see there's not much
room for cable management behind the
motherboard tray
although because there's no window you
don't have to worry too too much about
the overall appearance of the cables
just make sure that you optimizing them
for good airflow so let's have a look at
the front of the case and here you can
see in traditional Sonata style oh ok oh
yeah there we go it's not locked but it
does lock as has per the old Sonata
cases as well you can lock the front
here and so that's what gives you access
to the power switch as well as the reset
switch I remember the old sonatas the
door only used to open up
this much and people would frequently
break them off by accident in fact I
broke one off myself at one point so now
an tech has implemented this 270 degree
door-opening hinge so that you're a lot
less likely to accidentally push it too
far and break it off so there you go
here's our three five and a quarter inch
base and here is all of our front port
access so we've got two USB 2.0 USB 3.0
power hard drive led microphone as well
as headphones all right anything around
to the other side and there is the
inside of the Sonata four so it has a
fairly standard layout although there
are gonna be some tweaks well this is
interesting so the box oh okay the box
actually has to be removed via a screw
so I don't have a screw driver on yet
just this moment so we're gonna have to
make do here but the first thing I see
when I get inside the case is the front
USB 3.0 so the front USB 3.0 actually
runs via wire comes out the back of the
case and uses a USB port to plug into
the back of the i/o shield now I suspect
at some point an tech will update this
product to use an internal header now
that that spec has finally been
finalized but right now this is
unfortunately the most elegant way to do
front USB 3.0 now here's all of our
front panel ports including our front
USB 2.0 our power switch reset switch
power LED hard drive LED as well as
high-definition audio and AC 97 audio
the included power supply has a wide
variety of connectors this is a neo eco
621 so it's 80 plus you can actually see
the full specs there but it is a single
12 volt rail power supply which means
that no matter what kind of components
you're using as long as it has enough
power to supply to those components you
will not accidentally you know trip any
overcurrent protection or anything like
that
so we've got one 24 pin power connector
we've got 1 4+4 pin power connector as
well as no
yeah that's four plus four pin power
connector we've got dual PCI Express
connectors and you can see these cables
are fairly short but since they are
designed to work inside the Sonata four
which isn't fairly small chassis that's
not a problem at all so we have two PCIe
one is a six plus two and one is a six
pin so you can support any of the
highest end graphics cards with in this
case although be careful with
ventilation you're probably going to
want to add another fan say for example
on the hard drive cage or position
something on let me see if I can see if
they actually have any additional fan
mounts it looks like this fan can be
mounted on here but I don't see where
any extra ventilation is gonna oh that's
right the extra ventilation is gonna
come from the back in the hard drive
cages on the on the back side panel okay
so we've got six SATA connectors and
then we also have one two three molex
six molex connectors so that's our power
supply connectors here is our Tri cool
fan so we've got our switch is actually
integrated into the back of the case and
it's powered by molex connector so I'll
go ahead and show you guys that switch
and while we're back here I'll show you
the entire back panel so it comes with a
dummy i/o shield there's your seven
expansion slots here's a little bit of
extra ventilation room and other than
that there's not really much of note on
the back of the case now harddrive
mounting has been altered a fair bit on
the Sonata four so you can see these
hard drive cages can actually fit drives
on silicone grommets here we're gonna
remove the whole assembly here I'll show
you guys how this works so you can
actually mount the drives on silicone
grommets and you can do up to four
drives sideways so that that is a fairly
unique way of mounting the drives this
is all with bum screws so you don't
actually have to use a screw driver to
mount your hard drive which is kind of
neat as well and now let me see what
we've got in terms of accessories in our
accessory box here
okay so beyond the power cord which
stands to reason as this case does have
an included power supply we have some
zip ties as well as all of the necessary
screws we're going to need we have a key
for the front case and an antec case
badge and last but not least oh we've
actually got a drive bay adapter so this
is a five and a quarter inch to three
and a half inch external drive bay
adapter just in case you have a media
card reader or you know heaven forbid I
suppose a floppy drive or anything else
that you might need to plug into a three
and a half inch external drive so that's
pretty much all I have to say at this
time about the Sonata four thank you for
checking out my unboxing and don't
forget to subscribe to - tech tips for
more reviews on boxing's and other
computer videos aha I found the SSD
mount or rather cameraman found it it's
right here so this is not for a fan this
is for mounting a two and a half inch
SSD drive so you would put it right on
there so there actually isn't any
additional forced air intake so you're
going to be relying on your 120
millimeter exhaust for all of your well
exhaust so I wouldn't really recommend a
super high powered GPU like a GTX 580
but anything like a gtx 560 or below
should be just fine in a case like this
which is designed more for a mainstream
gamer or a mainstream consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
