a product from an Tek now the Sonata
line has been around since pretty much
the dawn of time as far as I can tell
but it has received some significant
updates since the original antec sonata
this is the sonata for the is is it is
like its predecessors a quiet mid tower
case elegantly silent they've added SSD
hard drive compatibility this is a quiet
computing product for man text which is
in line with the original concept for
the Sonata and is in my opinion what
makes the Sonata line so successful over
the long period of time that it has
existed so we're going to start opening
up the box but we're also going to have
a look at what antec has to say for
themselves in terms of spec so it can it
has a quiet 620 wat continuous power PSU
so that is higher than any previous
Sonata line although the Sonata other
than the Sonata elite are so not a proto
rather the Sonata line all comes of the
power supply but 620 watts is very
generous considering that it is so
because this is not sorry about the
battery there gets so because the Senate
has always been kind of a value bang for
the buck line of products that's very
generous it has 80 plus certification
now in terms of drive bays we've got
seven drive bays 35 and a quarter inch
and for three and a half inch seven
expansion slots which is ATX standard
one rear 120 millimeter try cool three
speed fan and we have front mounted USB
3.0 which is pretty cool to see on a
very mainstream case like the Sonata
series so let's we got some foam here so
you can see on text using a very robust
closed cell phone they don't want more
sonata for to be damaged at any point
shipping okay well that was very very
close because I probably should have
dumped it out with the phone rather than
without it there's what's left in the
box in case you guys are wondering
now let's see what the sonata for looks
like in person I did not have a chance
to visit antec at the CES 2011 show so I
actually have not seen this case in
person yet and it's upside down so that
is something I'm going to have to remedy
okay so here we are with the traditional
oh did I catch you there okay here we
are with the traditional piano black
finish now the last time I used a sonata
was actually a sonata too so I'm going
to be telling you guys what improvements
I see based on that ancient case so
we've got thumbscrews on both sides
which means that unlike the older older
sonata we can actually remove both side
panels there we are so that allows for
better cable management as well as
better accessibility to things like hard
drives or whatever basically cable
management more than anything else let's
see how fingerprint-resistant this
finishes so unlike older Sonata style
cases you can see the fingerprints do
leave a mark but it's not quite as ugly
as some of the previous ones this is
actually quite fingerprint resistant
considering everything and let's see how
easily they wipe off once you've got
something smeared on there oh that's
nice actually that's really nice okay so
here we've got some ventilation on the
side for your drives and then cameraman
wants to see the inside so that's how
it's mounted just using little plastic
clips okay so side panels off so we're
looking at the back side you can see
there's not much room for cable
management behind the motherboard tray
although because there's no window you
don't have to worry too too much about
the overall appearance of the cables
just make sure that you optimizing them
for good airflow so let's have a look at
the front of the case and here you can
see in traditional Sonata style oh okay
oh yeah there we go it's not locked but
it does lock as as per the old Sonata
cases as well you can lock the front
here and so that's what gives you access
to the power switch as well as the reset
switch
I remember the old sonatas the door only
used to open about this much and people
would frequently break them off by
accident in fact I broke one off myself
at one point so now antec has
implemented this 270 degree door opening
hinge so that you're a lot less likely
to accidentally push it too far and
break it off so there you go here's our
three five and a quarter inch base and
here is all of our front port access so
we've got two USB 2.0 USB 3.0 a hard
drive led microphone as well as
headphones alright anything around to
the other side and there is the inside
of the sonata for so it has a fairly
standard layout although there are gonna
be some tweaks oh this is interesting so
the box oh okay the box actually has to
be removed via a screw so I don't have a
screwdriver on me at just this moment so
we're gonna have to make do here but the
first thing I see when I get inside the
case is the front USB 3.0 so the front
USB 3.0 actually runs via wire comes out
the back of the case and uses a USB port
to plug into the back of the i/o shield
now I suspect at some point antec will
update this product to use an internal
header now that that spec has finally
been finalized but right now this is
unfortunately the most elegant way to do
front USB 3.0 now here's all of our
front panel ports including our front
USB 2.0 our power switch reset switch
power LED hard drive led as well as high
definition audio and ac97 audio the
included power supply has a wide variety
of connectors this is a neo eco 620 wats
so it's 80 plus you can actually see the
full specs there but it is a single 12
volt rail power supply which means that
no matter what kind of components you're
using as long as it has enough power to
supply to those components you will not
accidentally you know trip any over
current protection or anything like that
so we've got one 24 pin power connector
we've got 14 + 4 pin
our connector as well as not yet that's
four plus four pin power connector we've
got dual PCI Express connectors and you
can see these cables are fairly short
but since they are designed to work
inside the sonata for which is a fairly
small chassis that's not a problem at
all so we have two PCIe one is a six
plus two and one is a 6-pin so you can
support any of the highest end graphics
cards with in this case although be
careful with ventilation you're probably
going to want to add another fan say for
example on the hard drive cage or
position something on let me see if I
can see if they actually have any
additional fan mounts it looks like this
fan can be mounted on here but I don't
see where any extra ventilation scan oh
that's right the extra ventilation is
going to come from the back in the hard
drive cages on the on the back side
panel okay so we've got six SATA
connectors and then we also have one two
three molex six molex connectors so
that's our power supply connectors here
is our try cool fan so we've got our
switch is actually integrated into the
back of the case and it's powered by
molex connector so i'll go ahead and
show you guys that switch and while
we're back here i'll show you the entire
back panel so it comes with a dummy i/o
shield there's your 7 expansion slots
use a little bit of extra ventilation
room and other than that there's not
really much of note on the back of the
case now hard drive mounting has been
altered a fair bit on the sonata for so
you can see these hard drive cages can
actually fit drives on silicon grommets
we're going to remove the whole assembly
here to show you guys how this works so
you can actually mount the drives on
silicon grommets and you can do up to
four drives sideways so that that is a
fairly unique way of mounting the drives
this is all with bum screws so you don't
actually have to use a screwdriver to
mount your hard drive which is kind of
neat as well and let me see what we've
got in terms of accessories in our
accessory box here
okay so beyond the power cord which
stands to reason as this case does have
an included power supply we have some
zip ties as well as all of the necessary
screws we're going to need we have a key
for the front case and an antec case
badge and last but not least oh we've
actually got a drive bay adapter so this
is a five and a quarter inch to three
and a half inch external drive bay
adapter just in case you have a media
card reader or no heaven forbid I
suppose a floppy drive or anything else
that you might need to plug into a three
and a half inch external drive so that's
pretty much all i have to say at this
time about the sonata for thank you for
checking out my unboxing and don't
forget to subscribe to- tech tips for
more reviews on boxing's and other
computer videos haha i found the SSD
mount a rather camera man found it it's
right here so this is not for a fan this
is for mounting a two-and-a-half-inch
SSD drive so you would put it right on
there so there actually isn't any
additional forced air intake so you're
going to be relying on your 120
millimeter exhaust for all of your well
exhaust so I wouldn't really recommend a
super high powered GPU like a gtx 580
but anything like a gtx 560 or below
should be just fine in a case like this
which is designed more for a mainstream
gamer or mainstream consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
