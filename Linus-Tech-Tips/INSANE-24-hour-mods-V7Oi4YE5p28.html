computex 2016 this year check out their
lap dog it allows you to use desktop
peripherals on the couch also thanks to
MS I will be checking out their stuff
later on the show welcome to in win
booth they have eight different
computers that were modded for the mod
in Taiwan competition there's a lot on
the line three different prizes of
$5,000 and full system rigs all this
kind of stuff and you guys can vote you
guys are worth 30% of the total vote so
let's walk through each one and see
which one's your favorite first up is
coat of arms by BS mods they have the
30th anniversary logo on the shield on
the back they have a sword on the front
it is very obviously a medieval theme
one of my favorite things actually
harkens back to scrapyard Wars they have
this stuff that they found at Home Depot
which goes behind the cross and on the
inside of the computer as a skirt for
the motherboard tray which is just I
don't even know what it was just stuff
from Home Depot
apparently it cost 20 bucks and it adds
a ton to the theme it looks perfectly
medieval next up was titanfall by Team
Mongoose another two mod 24 contestant
which is pretty cool to see one thing
that I really liked about this rig is
they didn't leave anything bare
everything was covered by something and
then painted and then textured and it
just looks great
they have the titanfall eye up on the
front they have the trailer playing on
the front which is actually pretty cool
touch and then they scratched up the
SSDs which is cool because they're
different colors one of them was I
believe silver the other one was red now
they made them both look titanfall and
right on the top of the front there's
the 30th anniversary logo then we have
computer 3 pulsar by mbf they completely
absolutely change the inside of this
case the motherboard is in a different
direction the radiators on an angle they
have IO coming out a completely
different part of the computer they have
water cooling hard pipes coming in and
out the back of the case with reservoirs
out the back completely in a stack all
the way down pretty cool space inspired
case but unfortunately there is no 30th
anniversary logo and it did start to
leak so it has been shut off which is
the reason why it's not shining up all
nice and blue like it was earlier when
we first showed up our fourth contestant
is state of the art by running with
scissors they have the 30th anniversary
logo on the back and they have what
looks very much like the when show logo
going all throughout the computer so
they might get an extra point or two
from us for that the end the inside I
also have to point out that while they
do have sleeve cables like a couple of
the other group
do they actually sleeved their own at
the event to at least a certain degree
which is pretty damn cool and I must say
for an event that was eight hour
segments over three days this front
glass panel looks like it was from
factory extremely clean would very much
expect to see it on a case very cool
then we have 509 by babe tech another
space inspired computer with some pretty
interesting modifications they have
acrylic stacked with metal and then
glued together and paste it on the case
which makes it look like a spaceship
from descent which is actually kind of
cool I love that old game inside the
reservoir in the top there is an in win
logo which does count as the 30th
anniversary thing but because of the
bubbles it is a little bit hard to see
so I don't know how well that's going to
show up on camera they also have another
30th anniversary call it on the right
hand side panel where there's a lot more
of the like spaceship style aesthetic
then for number six we have WMD by team
down under these guys went absolutely
crazy there's so much stuff going on I'm
not entirely sure where to start but I
will start with their external radiator
which kind of reminds me of whole room
water cooling the tubes go at the back
just like in whole room water cooling
then they have three triple rads all
strapped together in what looks like a
backpack which is pretty cool and
there's an LCD display that has a
readout that comes from I 264 I also
appreciate that they didn't let anywhere
go without bullets even the reservoir on
the inside of the case is rounded with
bullets on the inside which is pretty
sweet and I like the oil drum style
reservoirs on the front fits the
military aesthetic as well then we have
glass city by SM PC modding this is a
meticulously clean and tidy build they
have glass on the back that shows their
cable management a very bold move for a
time restraint competition in the front
they have beautiful custom brushed
aluminum which is on the power supply
and around the inside of the case and
then their own pass-through panel for
the water cooling so that it can go to
the reservoir up in the front
another fun note is that they used water
cooling heat sinks on their memory but
then didn't water cool them it actually
looks really nice and clean with that
metal but I do unfortunately have to
point out that they didn't include the
30th anniversary logo anywhere on the
build and last number eight we have
Skull trail by kun mod this is a
beautiful rig it has a vertical graphics
card which I think works really really
well for this case I do like the blue
aesthetic that they did throughout
is a little bit of an age aesthetic but
I think it worked really well here they
added a quadrat up in the top which is
actually pretty cool there's a little
bit of controversy over the rig because
some of the metals were seeing seed and
painted by in wind but the I don't I
don't know how the rules exactly worked
out so we'll see how that ends up but
regardless it is an absolutely beautiful
build and one thing that I really
appreciate that they did is use glass
panels on each side this door and this
door are both glass panels and it looks
great so if you want to vote and I think
you should go to mod dot in - wyndcomm
and that'll probably be somewhere around
here anyways also again thank you to
Coursera for bring us here took the lap
dog if you like gaming on your couch if
you want to play like Civ or something
on the TV that's pretty cool also thank
you to MSI they have an a guest desktop
computer that we're going to check out
here and a new GT X 1080 so stay tuned
for that and stay subscribed aligning
