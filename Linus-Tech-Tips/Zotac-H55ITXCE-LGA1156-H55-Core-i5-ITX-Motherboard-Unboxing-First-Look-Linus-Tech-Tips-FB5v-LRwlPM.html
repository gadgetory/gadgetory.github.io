the zotac age 55 ITX Wi-Fi mind you
that's not really the whole story today
this is the whole story now with USB 3.0
because they had a board called this
before but this is the c dash e revision
which features USB 3.0 now i don't think
we ever actually unboxed the original
board so why don't we run through all of
the aspects of this board since this is
an unboxing and first look it's an aged
55 board so it does feature in LGA 1156
socket with support for core i3 Core i5
and even core i7 quad cores up to a max
TDP of 95 watts we have intel quickpath
technology until HD graphics ready
although this is the big one PCI Express
16 X because HD graphics is not quite as
impressive as being able to put a GTX
480 on a motherboard that's smaller than
a GTX 480 there it is okay hold on
there's more though dual channel ddr3 up
to 1333 megahertz 2 dims up to 8 gigs of
ram 6 SATA 2 stop moving what you doing
I guess that makes sense
10 USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0 ports
that's a lot a USB Gigabit LAN 802.11 n
Wi-Fi that is n standard Wi-Fi up to 300
megabits per second and that is one
feature-rich board so here this is your
antenna plug PCI bracket thing so you
will use this to plug in your antennas
which are also included with the port
like they really do include everything
it's kind of neat how sometimes you know
when you compare like a sounds like a
small product it seems to come with a
big accessory package there's two
antennas there is a DVI to VGA adapter
that is an i/o backplate very solid
feeling here's an extension cable into
case you need to extend your CPU 4 pin
connector to a longer CPU 4 pin
connector then you've got three SATA
cables which is an odd amount and
finally a quick installation guide and
fine
again a user's manual with a DVD that
you should CD rather that you should
throw away and download the latest from
ZOTAC check that out
lifetime warranty in USA Mexico Canada
and Latin American so Latin America so I
yeah eat it Europe Middle East and a
pack that's hidden Pacific Asia I
believe something like that anyway we
win we get a lifetime warranty you got
only a five-year warranty which is
actually still pretty freakin good for a
motherboard five years is is is actually
outstanding compared to some of the Tier
one motherboard manufacturers so here we
are let's have a look at the overall
board layout I thought this was actually
I thought I was showing you the board
right-side up but it looks like I'm not
it looks like now I'm showing you the
board right-side up so let's start with
the CPU socket as I mentioned before
this is an LGA 1156 socket with all of
the latest Intel processors supported
that is the ones on this socket not the
LGA 1366 processors we have a PCI
Express 16x slot we have a four pin CPU
power connector we've got a heatsink
right about here you can see this had to
be kind of machined down in order to
make room for the CPU fan but that means
it's gonna get a lot of incidental
airflow from whatever fan you do install
and you better make sure whatever CPU
heatsink you install it's giving that
some airflow because this is meant to be
installed in cramped cases where cooling
isn't always the best and if it's
designed to work this way
make sure it works this way they have a
battery we have our age fifty-five
chipset six SATA two ports two USB
headers I mean really this thing has
like a ton of USB anyone is that ten USB
2.0 on the back let me just verify that
really quick than one two three four or
five six no no that included the four
here okay so 10 total and then two USB
3.0 so it's all good
alright we have our wireless end PC mini
PCI Express card as well as our dual
channel ddr3 slot supporting up to 8
gigs of ram in a 24-pin connector here
is your CPU no this is system
and and this is your cpu fan connector
so you have two four pin pwm fan
connectors on this particular board here
is your front panel connector headers
and then that looks like your front
audio connector right there this board
does not include firewire which is fine
because firewire is mostly useless
anyway and let's have a look at the i/o
on the back here we go
we have a reset CMO switch that is
hardcore I want you to look closely at
that camera man clear CMOS on the back
panel I love this on a board like that's
barely as big as a C Mo's battery it's
epic it's awesome if that doesn't call
for overclocking and I don't know what
else does so we've got one two three
four five six USB 2.0 ports as I
mentioned before two USB 3.0 ports a ps2
port which I do still like to see DVI
HDMI eSATA Gigabit Ethernet optical
audio out as well as 7.1 audio and then
this is another thing that I just think
I should call attention to I talked
about this previously on Anna soos video
card look at the matte black PCB I mean
that is awesome everything should come
with a matte black PCB I mean look at it
it makes everything look way cooler I
mean if if Batman was in like glossy
piano black or you know that that color
that's like more like brown than black
like if Batman wore that color he
wouldn't look as cool but he wears matte
black and that's why he looks awesome
unless you watched the really old show
where he wears like gray and it's like
tights
Batman was less cool then thank you for
