this is the red eye and we are going to
try and figure out based on the
packaging what it does so okay we've got
the top of the box apparently it
provides you less clutter and more
control okay all right all right I can I
can dig it let's keep moving so
apparently it looks like this it is made
for ipod and works with iphone okay this
is all true it does work with both the
ipod and the iphone move around to this
side less clutter okay we covered that
already aha here we go you can turn your
iphone or ipod touch into a remote
control free application download
required so it's no big deal you go on
the App Store you download their red eye
appt here's the other side again and
yeah okay so yeah we've turned basically
you turn your ipod or your iphone into a
universal remote let's get the Box open
and we'll talk a little bit about how
this works so this guy right here this
is a Wi-Fi to infrared bridge it also
serves as a charging base station for
your iPad iPhone I well yeah obviously
you can't plug an iPad into it sorry
ipod or iphone so it's it's like that so
if it sat on your coffee table you might
say for example plug your phone into it
like this and then you wouldn't have to
worry about it running out of battery
while you're navigating channels which
is cool because i don't have the app
installed yet but i will be doing a
video outlining how to use this guy but
it seems sort of how it works and if you
can use the multi-touch to well be bad
apparently but you can use the
multi-touch to scroll through channels
or to increase the volume decrease the
volume you can actually customize the
layout of the universal remote on your
touchscreen according to which devices
you want to use so here we've got a
quick start guide so apparently you need
to plug in your red I device install the
software connect to the redeye device
and then set up the redeye device on
your Wi-Fi network last but not least
you can start using your red eye system
now it's actually expandable by adding
more red eyes or more iphones you can
configure it so that you know this
iphone is controlling this room right
now and
I fo now you want to control the living
room so that's pretty cool and cameraman
can scan that well we see the important
product information guide as well as the
oh there's a little support thing how to
get help with the product if you're
having trouble alright let's find out
what else we have inside and oh yeah
basically it turns it into a universal
remote for any of your infrared devices
that is your TV your cable box your DVD
player whatever else you happen to have
they have a huge library of codes Oh
need a doctor so I don't have to
actually just leave my phone hanging
there they have a huge library of codes
but you can also actually use their
little app to to learn new codes so you
can use your old remotes to program new
codes into their app so you've got a few
different adapters depending on what
kind of an iDevice you're going to be
plugging in and then last but not least
you have power so please do stay tuned
to my line of tech tips video blog where
you will see how to use this you can
also see more unboxings reviews other
technology videos like that and thank
you for watching and if you do already
have one of these you know Pete please
feel free to leave a comment under the
video I do read them actually and let me
know what you think of it and if there's
any particular things that that you
found work really well we say for
example bringing it over to someone's
house when you're having Christmas
dinner and then kind of quietly using
your iPhone you know install that in the
corner and then like either iphone to
like randomly change the channel when
someone's trying to watch the football
game or whatever so I didn't give you
guys that idea though don't forget to
subscribe so it's plugged in my phone is
charging cameraman insisted that we do
another video clip so that I could show
you the power LED and I guess this is
also a good time to show you that i have
installed the the adapter so that my
phone is supported so it's not going to
just when i'm pressing on it to change a
channel or whatever it's not going to
just put pressure on the connector so
there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
