Don box I have the g1 55 mobile gaming
environment and I think what they mean
is briefcase designed entirely to fit a
console and a screen inside now it comes
with the screen but it does not come
with the console or the controllers or
okay here we go
console and accessories not included so
that's that's that's important right
there although it does include some
accessories it does include an HDMI
cable
so speaking of HDMI it comes with a 15
point 5 inch HD LED display an HDMI
dedicated input stereo speakers and dual
audio jacks over on the other side you
can see it is designed for PlayStation 3
slim Xbox 360s so that's more slimmer
than the original Xbox 360 which it is
also designed for although some Xbox 360
consoles will require the use of the
component 2 HDMI converter ok I guess
that's the older one that did not come
with HDMI all right the G 155 is a
self-contained mobile gaming environment
that lets you stay in the action when
you're on the move to strap in your
gaming console store your accessories
select your favorite games and you're
good to go
the G 155 integrated HD display stereo
speakers and dual headphone jacks will
immerse you in your favorite game
wherever you are just pop it open plug
it in and play cool the components that
are included you know what we'll go
through that when we actually open it up
play supports your favorite gaming
console see integrated 15 point 5 inch
HD display lets you catch every detail
of your favorite games cool crank the
integrated stereo speakers and dual
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jacks and protect the rugged case
protects all your gaming gear from minor
impacts now this next one is huge travel
light weight design complies with
airline regulations and carry-on
guidelines that is cool so you can
actually use this to well stand in an
airport very inconspicuous Lea this guy
would not get questioned by airport
security I can guarantee you that you
can use it to to travel or you can use
it to recreate that old old MTV
commercial with the chair and the guy
being you know blown away by the by the
music
so you can do either of those things
let's go ahead and open this baby up now
I'm not going to be doing a demo with
this particular unit just yet but I will
be following up with one and okay
but I will be following up with a demo
of the unit after we do the unboxing
video so let's have a look at these
accessories that are included there is a
Walmart here which is going to so
that'll be used to power the screen
itself you will need to plug in your
console separately so that is two power
jacks for the entire unit once you put
in the console next we have a little
tiny HDMI cable which as you'll see will
be as long as needed
for this particular unit nice soft
closed cell foam very durable wouldn't
worry about this thing getting damaged
in shipping at all with that stuff
packed around it from the bottom you see
the same thing and I will go ahead and
this aside while we take out the unit
itself
Wow very cool-looking well-built
actually it feels like like luggage
actually okay so let's take a look at
the outside in the detail before we open
it up
great little G logo there on it alright
on the bottom you can see we've got
rubberized grip II pieces here here here
here and here so when you put this down
it's actually gonna keep it flat so it's
well that's a little okay well right now
without a console in it it's pretty
heavy on the one side so it might seem
inclined to tip over
I suspect once you put the console in
its gonna sit very easily and it's very
difficult to move around with those
rubber pieces down there the handles
right here so you can see it's got two
metal rods on either side and should be
able to support the weight of it no
problem on this side which is clearly
meant to be at the bottom that's for the
console sits you've got one two three
rubber strips and on the other side as
you guys saw already we have the
manufacturer logo so let's go ahead and
open and that'll be a little bit easier
to do also with a console sitting in it
and there is the mobile gaming station
so inside we find a user's manual let's
go ahead and take out this pack here
some velcro strips to hold down response
all cool cool
okay flip this over so manufactured week
25 of 2011 all right we've got an insert
here so this side is for the PlayStation
3 slim and xbox 360's and then this side
is for the Xbox 360 so since I'll be
installing an Xbox 360 in here I'm gonna
go ahead and put that in so you can see
we have some little padded storage
compartments here where you can store
things and then you can just pull on a
rip cord here tighten that up so that
it's not going to go anywhere in transit
okay say anything on the other side
storage compartment here not you can
cinch it shut and make sure that nothing
comes out this is for securing the
console as I mentioned before so these
just run through the hop the loops which
are down here okay so I would recommend
leaving those I mean once you put the
console in you're never gonna take it
out anyway so you strap it in don't
throw it down going anywhere and now
let's have a look at the display itself
so you can see it comes with a
protective plastic cover so that is a
glossy display alright remember guys
blossie does help with the vibrancy of
the image although there are certain
disadvantages to lossy style displays
and that is when you don't have adequate
shade for the display you can get a fair
amount of reflectiveness off it however
check this out with the included shroud
over the g1 55 gaming station it
actually provides some shade to the
display so if you're sitting in front of
it like this I would expect that unless
you have a light directly behind you
pointed at the screen you're not going
to have too much difficulty with that
because it's going to provide some shape
for it now in terms of controls on the
screen itself let's just coming down
here and have a look so there is what
appears to be an IR sensor there is a
power button your stereo speakers here
and here we've got volume down volume up
brightness down brightness up a menu
button there is the power input
and here's the HDMI input and this is
cool so two dedicated headphone jacks so
if you didn't already know that this is
a special SKU just for this particular
unit as far as the included TV goes and
you should know that by now because it
has their logo on it okay and then B it
has not only the speakers but also the
two headphone jacks so that means that
if you're on the go you can plug in
either a little wireless headphone thing
which I have one they're really handy
and then you can have two separate
people using their wireless headphones
or you can plug in just two regular
headphones and you can have two gamers
running at the same time off the screen
without any difficulty so here are the
HDMI cable goes here and then it's just
going to plug into the back of your
console like that and then the power
cable is going to go right here and I
will plug in to power and then power
will come over back to your console but
you can also run to a nearby power
outlet speaking of which the length of
the court might be relevant to some of
you so I'll just show you how long it is
so you should be able to reach without
too much difficulty a nearby wall in
fact let's try and find a nearby wall
outlet that I can reach from there look
at that
haha it worked success alright so I look
forward to bringing you guys an update
once I've had a chance to actually game
on this guy and thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look on Linus
