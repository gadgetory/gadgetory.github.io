Computex this year we would not be here
without them also thank you to linda.com
alright guys welcome to the random field
of glowing sheep in the background where
we will be checking out the fractal core
500 the core 500 is basically a tuned
down version of the node 304 and now why
is it not called a node something no one
was actually able to tell me so we're
moving on from there the front of the
case is a brushed faux aluminium
actually plastic front panel with a
surprising five and a quarter inch Bay
in terms of i/o you've got two USB 3.0
audio in and out power button with a
white LED a hard drive activity white
LED and a reset button
there's meshing pretty much everywhere
the front has meshing just on the side
of the actual bezel the top of the case
has a large meshed area which is
actually filtered and your RAD will
probably go there the left hand side has
a large meshed area as well the bottom
has a kind of not super huge but also
meshed area and the right hand side has
a smaller meshed area moving on to the
inside of the case there's tons of
storage there's one two and a half inch
bay just inside the front panel just
kind of before you actually get into the
rest of the case then on the far right
hand side there's two more two and a
half inch slots on the far side of this
middle metal plate and then on the inner
side there's two three and a half inch
bays four hard drives and then just
below the five and a quarter inch bay in
the front there's one more hard drive
spot leaving you with three spots for
three and a half inch hard drives and
two spots for two and a half inch hard
drives or SSDs for cooling you can
install a 240 millimeter radiator in the
top or possibly a 280 if it kind of fits
but you're very likely gonna have some
kind of compatibility issues there in
the back of the case you can fit a 140
millimeter fan but it already comes with
one so they've got you covered there for
graphics card you've got pretty much all
the clearance you could want you can fit
basically as long as the graphics card
as you would like but you may have
noticed by now that the power supply
positioning is a little bit weird is not
at the back of the case you don't
actually see a large power supply
spacing at the back of the case
although you do see an input for power
supply power without one even being
installed there that's because there's
an extension or a pass-through that goes
throughout the case and your power
supply actually gets installed much
closer to the front under that five and
a quarter inch Bay kind of on the
right-hand side what do you guys think
about the core 500 let me know in the
comments down below
over on the forum or on twitter at luke
underscore le afar also her ash Josh

this year I want to talk to him about
what the core 500 was like but I
couldn't because he wasn't here

reason why we're actually here they have
