sending us to PAX East 2016 check them
out in the video description below
when welcome to PAX East 2016 my name is
Nick van Berkel usually Brandon would be
doing these kind of gear bag videos but
guess what Brandon's not here and I am
so I'm going to be doing this gear bag
video today for you so what we've got
here for a backpack is the DES kind
reload bag this is a bag that I've had
for a while from shooting sports and
that kind of stuff I'll bring it with me
on trips because shooting shrimp lower
coverage is kind of like shooting sports
because you're running around all over
the place and you don't know where
you're going to be we generally bring
one of our other cameras like the a7s2
and we go travel on the trip and shoot
some show coverage because it's smaller
and when you go through the airport
they're not asking you like what's this
thing it just looks like a photo camera
but this year we're bringing the fs5
because we weren't able to bring one of
our other cameras because Brandon's got
them somewhere across the world who
knows first things first
I always bring my Canon 6d as like a
backup camera we probably won't use it
but it is a good camera in a pinch so
it's decent to always have around and it
doesn't take up that much space so we
generally bring like a 24 to 105 because
it's a pretty good all-around workhorse
lens and it's got image stabilization so
when you're like for Red Bulls deep into
show coverage and you're trying to get
that still shot with your hands shaking
all around it does a pretty good job at
keeping you steady so you don't look
like an idiot when you're filming
excellence we have here is a Tokina 11
to 16 it's super wide you're not really
supposed to use it on a full-frame
camera I do anyways and use it at like
14 to 16 mil because I do what I want
and it still looks okay alright another
little piece of gear I like for backup
just like the 6d is an h4 n I always try
and bring one just in case your audio
solution screws up another piece of
equipment that I like to bring on top of
the camera is a little LED light
something that can just sit on there
this uses so many batteries it's a young
no I don't know how to pronounce that
maybe Denis does it is his light
it's pretty good for lighting b-roll in
situations where you're going to have
crappy lighting which is like pretty
much every booth when you have one of
these puppies it just lights up whatever
the hell you're trying to shoot you're
not
at like 12,000 ISO you get that light on
there you're going to get those six
shots it's going to be looking wicked
but we got a ton of battery banks here
those are always handy in pretty much
any situation some people like to have
over your headphones I like to bring IMS
or earbuds these are like clips s4i
headphones for an iPhone they do a
pretty good job at replicating decent
sound it's enough for monitoring and if
you've got like over your headphones all
the time you might be blocking out some
of that outside noise which is great but
at the same time you're probably only
got one free hand and now your hands
they trying to like get stuff ready and
put these headphones on you're gonna
look like Dennis in their office with
headphones all over his face I have the
Sennheiser momentum Wireless I honestly
just bring them for the airplane I don't
like to hear anyone else on the airplane
so I bring these puppies on I turn them
on noise cancelling and then I try and
ball sleep now I know this is a tech
channel and you guys want to see the
latest and greatest gear and all those
sort of electronic gadgets and gizmos
and whatnot but one of the biggest
things that I always have to have in my
camera bag
it's next because you're going to be
grumpy man you're going to be out there
on the show floor you're not going to
eat for like who knows how long six
seven hours you got to have some clip
bars in there so you don't get into a
bad mood you don't get that low blood
sugar this is something I don't usually
bring in my camera bag per se but they
were giving them away at the twitch
booth and I figured hey that's actually
a pretty good idea to have with you at
all times
little old spice a little deodorant so
you're not stinking up the place because
you're going to be running around
there's a good chance you probably gonna
stink another thing that's essentially
you got to have your Kingston card
reader who knows when you need to
offload footage if you max out a card or
something like that I also like to keep
a little box a little case a little
waterproof sealed
Brandon Lee case for carrying your cards
I usually end up putting them in my
pocket which is not a good practice if
you go out shooting all day and then you
end up losing a card or breaking it
that's a waste of time for you or your
boss or your mom for everyone honestly
we brought a Sennheiser wireless mic kit
this is the AV x kit that we've done a
review on in one of our past videos
audio is obviously incredibly important
because just like right now it's
incredibly loud and if we didn't have a
hammer type mic like this one you
probably wouldn't hear me at all it'd be
booming and echoey and all that kind of
junk but that's pretty much it for all
the camera stuff Luke's going to tell
you about some computer stuff in terms
of the computers we have three different
like high-end gaming computers starting
with Dennis's computer which is
kind of the most badass doesn't I 7 6700
K yes a desktop series CPU 32 gigabytes
of RAM and an NVIDIA GTX 980 desktop
edition this is a laptop and as a
desktop processor and a desktop graphics
card which is actually kind of ludicrous
we have a video on it up here it has a
crazy model name so yeah just click on
that it's a Sager Burkle's is almost
equally as insane but just not quite so
much in the CPU department he has an msi
gt72 s it has an i7 69 20 HQ 32
gigabytes of RAM and another nvidia 980
GTX desktop Edition card so it's a
mobile processor and a desktop graphics
card then myself minds can adjust for
gaming not actually for editing so cool
regardless I got to borrow a gaming
laptop from work that was nice anyways
mine has an i7 47 you 24 gigs of RAM and
NVIDIA 980m I guess I don't get a
desktop 980 for gaming whatever the
reason why we're here in the BYOC
section with these laptops is so that we
could shoot on the floor and then send
someone back to the BRC area with an SD
card and have them editing in minutes
instead of bringing everything back to
the hotel at the end of the day and then
editing there that made it much more
efficient and we were able to edit
things at the show much more on time
Brandon isn't staying up til 4:00 a.m.
in the morning yeah just a lot easier to
do it this way anyways guys I massively
prefer this style I like it when people
are able to come back and edit during
the show it's nice having a base of
operations for us to work out of that
isn't like a booth that costs us
thousands and thousands thousands of
dollars that being said the nerd fusion
booth was pretty quick shout out to 7 us
there anyways let me know what you guys
think about this video in the comments
down below thanks for watching all of
our PAX East 2016 content this is it we
got a pack and go home so I'll see you

their keyboards and mice and headsets

you to discord which Dennis might
actually be able to see the little thing
up there I'm not sure if you can see it
from here anyway
doesn't really matter they're awesome
they have free voice and text chat
servers with tons of different
customizability options you can have
friends list it's free like I already
said it's there's DDoS protection

don't know they're cool
