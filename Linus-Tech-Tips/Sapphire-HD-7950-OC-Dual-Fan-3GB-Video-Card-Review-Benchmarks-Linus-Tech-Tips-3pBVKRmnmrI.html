Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 and I guess the
7950 in general although I'll be testing
it a couple of different ways so first
of all a quick overview of the card
it's a 7950 which means that aside from
the fact that it's got a custom PCB okay
it's got a custom shroud with custom
dual 92 millimeter fan cooling big old
fat heat pipes for also for cooling
right there big fin array um heat
spreader for all the memory and vrm and
all that good stuff you can see that
down here in the black piece it's got up
to four displays out with DVI HDMI and
dual mini display ports it is a PCI
Express 3.0 card two PCIe power other
than that it is a completely normal 7950
except this is an overclocked edition so
this is an overclocked card so I'm going
to be testing it two ways I'm going to
test it in its default config and then
I'm going to manually dial it down to
regular 7950 to see how much performance
we're getting by buying this overclocked
card versus a different one in terms of
the competition we've got quite a few
things because this is a next-generation
card
it's an overclocked card I'm going to be
comparing it against not only things
that are somewhat fair like the GTX 571
580 which are in sort of similar price
bans and they're similar types of
products but also the GTX 590 which is a
dual GPU card the HD 6970 as well as
6950 with the dual BIOS switch on this
particular card I can test it either way
although it is a 69 70 I just hit the
switch up to position two and I can test
it as a 69 50 I'm also comparing it to
its big brother the 7970 although that
is a 100% vanilla card so we're going to
see how this overclocked Edition
compares not only to the 7970 but also
to what it itself would be if it wasn't
overclocked before we get to
benchmarking results I want to walk you
guys through the card a little bit so
here it is on my test bench I actually
haven't seen the performance numbers of
this particular card yet but I want to
start with another number that's very
interesting so due to the 28
a meter manufacturing process and some
clever engineering from AMD
this system idles at 86 watts from the
wall unfreaking believable the card is
near silent so even over my course I
reach 70 and Noctua fans you can
probably only start to pick up these
fans at idle at about this far away
whoops
at probably about 3 or 4 inches away so
that's that's very cool it makes the
system very quiet because you can see
the courser fan also doesn't spin when
the power consumption is very low bear
in mind with that 86 watts at the wall
this is an overclock to 4 gigahertz core
i7 2600
no Intel power saving features enabled
on it so it's at 4 gigahertz right now
simply astounding oh oh yeah finally
idle temperatures so we're also going to
log the temperatures during our
benchmark and find out how hot it gets
during a gaming load so at default 7950
clocks that's where we took these power
measurements and temperature readings we
are peaking at 55 degrees and I'm going
to have to fire up a game again in order
to check the power because I forgot with
load power consumption just north of 200
watts so that means with this 80 plus
gold power supply which check it out the
fan isn't even spinning in a game
scenario we're actually only powering
giving the system about 200 watts of
power with about 220 watts being pulled
from the wall with the carnet it's 900
megahertz default overclocked speed we
were only one degree higher at idle and
just a touch higher in terms of power
consumption at the wall it hovers around
90 degrees give or take just idling at
the desktop so now let's fire it up and
see what kind of performance numbers we
can get out of it
power consumption again in the witcher 2
seems to be pretty much identical and
the stems the reason because i haven't
actually changed any voltage settings to
2-under volt it and then to re over bolt
it back to its default speed of 900
megahertz so let's have a look at our
maximum temperature which is 56 so we
managed to get one degree toast here
there's a 56 there somewhere and it's
is very very quiet I also noticed that
this particular card exhibits
significantly less coil whines sorry
about the focus there guys then most of
the AMD reference cards that I have
encountered whether it's that one that
one or that one so that was a huge
positive surprise for me so I'm going to
go ahead and compile the results and
we're oh I showed you power ok I showed
you power consumption I showed you load
temps at the overclock speed so let's
have a look at the performance I used
Crysis 2 The Witcher as well as
battlefield 3 so if you guys really care
to analyze this then you can go ahead
and freeze the frame here and you can
see all of the data including min Max
and average for the three games that
we're testing and all the cards I just
want to clarify one thing this is the
7970 this is the 7970 with a 7950 bios
on it because i wanted to see how
closely it would perform to a 7950 at
stock speed with the with the with the
BIOS flash to 7950 because I was really
hoping I'd be able to do the same thing
that I do with my 6970 where I can use
it as a 69 70 or 69 50 but it looks like
the 70 900 series doesn't disable the
functional units if you flash it with a
different bios so that's what that weird
cryptic b2 result is I have the 7950 OC
- the sapphire Oh seed card and then I
turned it down to stock 7950 speed so we
could get those results as well so other
than that it should be fairly
self-explanatory one other thing that's
going to stand out to you guys is that
in battlefield 3 the 6990 didn't seem to
be performing right although i just i
included it anyway because honestly it's
been my experience with the 6990 overall
hence it being shelved at the moment
over there literally shelved um that
it's just a bear to work with it's not
very consistent so GTX 590 is the big
winner with 7970 outperforming
everything else in spite of it being a
single GPU card 7950 OC does perform a
little bit better although if we go back
to the min max average you can see that
the overclocked minimum is significantly
better than the stock minimum so it does
seem to be helping there you go there's
those results
average FPS then we got Crysis - so
Crysis 2 the two dual GPU cards are
pretty much neck-and-neck
sorry I didn't add the data labels there
you go oh and I didn't change the
formatting here whatever you guys you
guys are cool you were waiting hold on
there we go fix it those are legible so
the dual GPU cards lead the way the 7970
um comes in second with the GTX 580
exactly tied with the 7950 OC making the
7950 OC a significantly better value and
this one also we see a fairly different
performance level from the overclocked
card versus the stock card something to
be noted here is that these dual GPU
cards neither of them scale particularly
well which means we're probably running
into a CPU bound scenario around 130 FPS
on this game finally the which are two
very very GPU bound so you can see the
dual GPU cards do pull away the 7970
performs at the top of the single GPUs
with the 7950 coming in just behind it
so looking at the data labels there and
we're gonna go and yeah yeah yeah move
those decimals so you guys don't have to
look at completely illegible numbers SEC
fixed okay and then the Nvidia cards
really fall down at the bottom of the
heap of this one with the last
generation AMD card so this game really
shows the power of the 7950 with the OC
card coming in somewhere between a 7950
stock card and a 79 70 which is
significantly more expensive so there
you have it 28 nanometer architecture
delivers awesome power consumption great
performance the dual BIOS card
supporting Eyefinity with up to 4
displays the duel fans run cool and
quiet I'm actually really impressed with
the cooler on this particular card so
