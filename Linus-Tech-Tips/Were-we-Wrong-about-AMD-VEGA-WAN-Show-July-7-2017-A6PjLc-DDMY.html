friends and also all of you people who
are watching because well let's face it
you and I are the one no I'm saying that
we're like we're friends okay I'm not
saying we're not you just put there
internet friends you win yes they're
internet friends but that is totally a
different classification Jake calls me
an Internet friend does he really he
does even though you actually are in the
same building as each other and
everybody's like four to six thousand
the first time I met him was in person
right you know he's wrong so an Internet
friend we can like we can actually
define this fairly easily and internet
friend to me okay someone that you had
to meet first online okay okay and that
you've only seen in person either once
or if the additional times you've seen
them in person were because you happened
to be traveling to get there anyway okay
is that fair so like a con or something
yes like they're in it like you met them
at a convention awhile ago or you met
them online or yeah okay and then oh we
both happen to go to pax yes I see them
at pax once a year they're still an
Internet friend yeah okay yeah yeah I
can see that yeah you got any other sort
of ways to define what an Internet
friend is um no I think that's pretty
good I think you could meet them in
person first ilk really yeah because
like for instance there was at LAN
Coover okay I met a dude who's sitting
right next to me do you have to meet
them somewhere techie can I just jump in
with that I think that would help a lot
okay what I see I think it has to do
with like the percentage of interaction
so I met this dude at LAN Coover okay we
only started talking on the last day and
pretty much all that happened was I was
like hey what's that game that you're
playing and he's like it's this like oh
and end up being a multiplayer game and
I was like it looks pretty cool maybe
I'll get it he was like sure I'll play
with you add me on Steam never talk to
him at all outside of that interaction
in person and then only talk to him
online for like years past that okay so
I think you're pretty safely Internet
friendzone that guy yeah now let me get
you with a different one so
met someone at Bible Camp okay okay so
I'm there for like a week but see that
that's the I think that's one of the
differentiators this isn't necessarily a
techie thing that you're talking about
but you're kind of locked in this
situation yeah you committed to go here
yes I had to be there you're staying
there max really yeah
not allowed not even gets a payment
thing it's in like hope so you're not
there to go anyway the thing about the
British Columbian city of hope you're
all sweet other than the name for a
little ironic case yeah so okay so I so
I meet a girl at at camp and we only
talk like a few times it was one time
but then we exchanged no not like that
but then we look at what I became poke a
really state Bible Camp no band camp ah
so we exchange MSN because that's what
we had to drive this service in those
days Oh everything was so we spent the
next year MSN in constantly but didn't
see each other for an entire year okay
okay then after the following year Bible
Camp we start dating is she because it
develops into something else
is she still an Internet friend for that
first year see okay this is even more
wild because I've only ever actually
thought of the concept isn't because
these are what my friends do I've only
thought of the concept as internet
friend as gamers right because anyone
that I had like extended conversations
with that we weren't gaming mm-hmm was
like people that went to my school so
they were definitely real-life friends
because I saw them Dave got it right so
I think that is a real-life friend that
transitioned to an Internet friend that
transition to a girlfriend that is a
real-life person okay that's a lot of
transitions I think you guys
flip-flopped a little bit okay I think
there was some flopping okay got it got
it internet friend swapping we do the
friend flop yeah what I was really all
wrong with that so we got a great show
for you guys today
contrary to what you might think what
I'm in witness that in
besh main news topics am VXR vague
aspects leak
Wow surprising so this is the the gaming
version of Vega um number two how is it
just all AMD news no one saw that coming
go rise in five sixteen hundred becomes
the second best-selling CPU on Amazon
that's actually pretty cool though let
me go get a round of applause yes AMD
dredge right building a thing that
people think is bomb alright although
this is kind of a part two of that news
story the rumor has officially been
squashed AMD having taking ten percent
market share from Intel if not a thing o
building the world's biggest lithium-ion
battery in South Australia but the
Germans are building an even bigger
battery but that's not gonna be ready
for like quite a while while Elon Musk's
version I think is gonna be ready pretty
soon and the format dictates that we
should have four main news topic
call-outs but I have to call this one
out Canadian porn mega site pornhub
becomes interactive with a new series of
videos so you'll pretty much never have
to leave the house again now is sort of
where that might be heading all right
then let's launch the intro and get into
it
I had no idea that pornhub was Canadian
are they ready there yeah they are I
even looked it up on Wikipedia careful
with that search now no I'm okay now
okay now hold on let's get this bulb in
get the sponsor yeah
here you service turkey fresh book out
seven mg MGB okay so now let's do kind
of ten steamboats to make sure that
launchers checking to make sure we did
that aren't still watching gotta have a
wee bit of a buffer shadow you know we
could pretend to launch into a topic
about the high-tech thing that's in this
box blah blah highly related yeah highly
right is that look at this vacuum in
there okay I think we've waited long
integers
okay so Linus is screen so porn how to
Canadian the first thing obviously is
Canadian porn videos okay so you can
watch Canadians and Canadian babes and
Canadian amateurs Canadian girls
Edward leaps today I learned that
pornhub is a Canadian company
this is reddit to be the UH one second I
am eighteen plus but I don't know for a
fact that you guys are like go to
Wikipedia and here we go okay okay its
Wikipedia launched and headquartered in
Montreal go figure
and here okay I learned something else
today Montreal is the third largest porn
producing of the city in the world after
LA and Amsterdam
wow I had no clue at all I love how the
rigid the first part of that so proud of
my city haha how about that good job
um okay anyway let's get into let's get
into some tech topics here first
so this was originally posted by mr.
troll on the forum and these for England
and one is WCC F Tech so take it with a
grain of salt as usual looks sick I'm
just going to drop that in there really
quick I really like this new design that
looks a lot better than the frontier
edition it does I love the blacked out
PCI Express bracket it's always you
don't touches like that that make a big
difference and actually this logo I
really didn't like
black on blue okay but red on black
really sick like that's honestly the
whole time it is just reminded me of
descent okay you don't say anything
I could see how you could go kind of
scary eyes on it yeah but without being
too overtly that yeah I like it yeah
it's kind of got like a Batman the
Animated Series kind of vibe to I think
it brings the little bit of the fun back
to like how graphics cards get to look
yeah completely it's been like well the
only high-performance graphics cards
that have existed have been in videos
and they're gray and they are the order
black yes some black they're gray except
when they're black and also you get a
green lighting accent or a badly brain
but like and they look sharp but it's
been the same thing for a really long
time and like I kind of I understand
that it looks gaudy and is objectively
worse but I kind of sometimes miss the
old days and you'd have like the art on
the graphics card shut up you think it
was fun you can miss your sponge and
miss it in a nostalgic way but you would
not put that in your system today admit
it now because I admit no admit it mr.
Rickard cringe boom I'm not letting you
change the subject
admit it you would not put that in your
system today I would no you would no you
wouldn't would no you wouldn't
upgrade me to today's you guys I'll do
it no they don't
there aren't even any there's nothing
dad dad anymore did it there is nothing
at D Brant to skin it okay hold on let
me see if I can find little zone dress
like um I'm sure they've looked into it
at some point okay okay not bad this is
what we're talking about but like it's
not kind of crap that used to be on
high-end care but pull me back out camo
and like some why are these all the same
thing did you look up this yeah I looked
up this specific card Oh hilarious okay
this I I said that's fine but it's like
there's like that barks coming off of it
and it looks ridiculous but that's fine
that's not like stupid like looks like
okay let's find some gain word video
kinda like okay they're pretty cool
those all look fine okay no no but let's
go back to like you know 1888 hundreds
like look at this
yes hahaha looks like WWE Buddha or
something like what literally changed
their mind on what they were drawing
many times and then we're just like
that's fine
just perfect okay I'm you know what's it
screw it
I'm not getting paid that much to do
this anyway yeah exactly like no you
would not be putting that jank bullcrap
in your system total performance means
all right so let's talk about some RX
Vega specs here it's going to be
shipping with a core clock of around
1630 megahertz so at what point do I
people were hating on me so hard for the
Vega reality check on last week's LAN
show I'm not suppose I knew that there's
this the professional card so it doesn't
indicate about the gaming card things
like that's like comparing a NVIDIA
Quadro to a g-force in games which you
can do and they perform the same got on
surprising there are some fair points
there are some features that are not yet
enabled on the frontier edition card
that had hesitated first I almost call
that boundaries edition there are some
features that aren't enabled on the
frontier edition card and they are
gaining features but what I said on the
show if you actually listen is that it's
not going to be making up the
performance Delta to give AMD a
legitimate talk to your competitor it's
not going to get faster er enough to
take on the 1080 Ti I don't see that
realistically happening and something
you guys have to understand as well is
that Nvidia is just toying with them at
this point they are they have they are
showing volta hardware
and if they have big Volta you don't
have to think too critically to look
back and go well whenever they've got
working hardware of a given new
architecture the other size dyes are
only as far behind as the team tweaking
and altering and finalizing them takes
that's how far behind Volta hardware is
so by the time you can actually buy an
RX Vega nvidia sitting there going okay
do we launch in you know two months or
like do we start announcing do we start
teasing to to kill the hype train a
little bit or do we do we have a year to
sit and milk Pascal miss while out you
know while Volta just well we take all
our Volta and we send it into the
supercomputing space I mean to be clear
it's not like I'm rooting for Nvidia
here people misunderstand me a lot of
the time it's just that I can take
things that we know and extrapolate
based on other things that we can guess
or that were historically true and make
an educated guess even if I don't have
the hardware in hand this is why we
theorized in the past about being able
to make a video about a graphics card
before it comes out and how accurate
that would actually be and honestly we
keep joking about making it but if we
did I don't think it would be a very
valuable piece of content and we get
trashed on for making it so ya know real
so we're not going to do it no but a lot
of times when we have been pretty damn
close very like freakishly close like
with one piece of information like it's
all we knew was price yeah putting
together believable performance graphs
based on everything else that we know
pretty pretty solid and like one thing
that I did for the 1080 launch was I
went around and I asked creators what
they thought the price would be or know
what they thought the hardware would be
in it and what they thought the price
would be rash and how they thought the
performance would be ish and other than
the surprise of SNP
pretty accurate it was pretty close
within a hundred dollars every time
within a pretty tight performance metric
every time okay so I Lucy a little bit
of discussion in twitch chat about how
we tried to do that with the risin 5 we
did not yeah and it worked
yeah all right since five numbers we're
bang on and and all the stress and upset
that people had about some of the cores
being on one PC X and some of them being
on another one ended up being a
non-factor when it came to anything
other than a few specific benchmarks
most of which were synthetic so you can
you can guess a lot anyway sorry I will
finish talking about the specs eight
gigs of HBM to memory which is freaking
incredible but also terrifying so it's
incredible because HBM 2 is coming to a
non like AI supercomputing card yeah
but terrifying because it's not going to
be cheap and I do worry about rx Vega
being price competitive if it's going to
be shipping with such expensive memory
yeah
so that'll total 484 gigabytes of memory
bandwidth alrighty then and the rumored
3d mark 11 performance score has rx Vega
at 30 1,800 about 4000 ahead of the GTX
1080 and about double the score of the
GTX 1070 that's oh no that doesn't seem
right
I don't think there was that big of a
difference between the 770 I mean mind
you guys this is a synthetic benchmark
and it has the ten atti maintaining a
commanding lead with over 38,000 points
the rumored cost would be $600 so right
now it's hard to talk about graphics
card price yeah exactly what I was just
going to say 1080i on amazon.com looks
like it's about 900 to 950 1080i on
Newegg right here looks like it's about
750 plus maybe a little bit depending on
what version you get they do have stocks
so it looks like miners are not buying
these very high-end cards at least in
stock limit two per customer so if it
can come in
within spitting distance of the ten atti
at $600 then at least AMD is looking
like they could have a performance
competitive product though we still
don't know necessarily anything about
how async compute is going to shake down
what Vulcan and directx12
performance in real games is going to
look like we still don't know much about
how it's going to size up power
consumption so like performance per watt
lies although that doesn't look very
promising ah might also just like barely
matter because I suspect this price
isn't going to stay the same at all
right because AMD cards right now are
better the beining remaining so they're
just all going to vanish that's kind of
my expectation we'll see yeah it's
starting to the mining thing is starting
to cool down a little bit it's still
pretty easy apparently I can tell but it
starting to cool down a little bit so
we'll see by the time this actually
drops how much impact it will have in
regards of that bump up of above but
yeah alright so ah this was originally
posted by pricing on the forum so it's a
little bit more Vega news before we move
on
AMD's raja Kaduri confirms RX vega die
size at 484 millimeters squared so
that's pretty darn big that's a big GPU
we actually covered this in a little bit
more depth in our NVIDIA GPUs through
the ages as well as Deepika named DGP
now we did both of them we did both AMD
and NVIDIA GPUs through the ages and I'm
trying to pull that up right now but
there have only been a handful of GPUs
that have been bigger than about 500
millimeters squared so Oh for some
reason it's prompting me for credentials
here that is that is very very annoying
so I can't look it up other than to like
load up the video right now but
what that tells us is that AMD was if
die sizes anything to go on and a lot of
the time it can be because it tells us
sort of how expensive the GPU is and
therefore what price Bend
they're probably hoping to target with
the finished product and therefore what
performance they think that they're
probably going to have to compete with
so that tells us that AMD maybe didn't
think that they were going for
unprecedented performance like they
would have with something like the our
600 so that was the 2900 XT but
hopefully I can find yeah I think this
is going to be too hard to find live
right now
but it tells us that they were
legitimately going for something pretty
darn high-end yeah unfortunately I can't
I can't find my my die size graph with
all of them on it but that's ok wata
graphs man yeah it's a lot of graphs in
this video so there's this just not a
lot I can do about that oh I hope I'm
not yeah no I'm not doing that ok so
here we go this is part 1 of 2 of this
next topic this was posted not by nobody
on the forum so this was an article over
on Tom's hardware and the risin 5 1600
skyrockets to number 2 on Amazon and
while this isn't a like 100% indication
of you know how many of them are out
there pass mark submissions have
increased telling us that people are out
there buying AMD risin CPUs which is
great news even though this is after
intel's reactionary moves with the 77 40
and the 76 40 yeah and like the kind of
hash mark thing that's obviously only
going to be like rather hardcore people
but being number 2 on amazon is very
transparent like building your build
your own PC people for the most part but
with that said we actually have a review
unit coming in of an all AMD entry level
gaming rig from Dell
okay that's interesting right yeah
because if you get partners like that on
board that makes a lot more mainstream -
Dells the kind of company that sells
boxes to people who aren't necessarily
looking at the real world performance in
benchmark X and you know real world
application why just want to buy a thing
and have it play a game and they're
looking for appealing specs and that's
something that AMD did really really
well with Rison is they not only
delivered something that performs well
in the benchmarks but they delivered
something that looks great on paper
sounds good this one has eight
processing cores and 16 threads even if
you don't understand what that means
sounds like a lot it's a lot it's double
what number what the comparably priced
Intel one would be yeah that is
fantastic
synergy to use the probably the word
they used synergy between the marketing
team and sales team and engineering
ticketing sales and engineering yeah so
you got to give them full credit for
that and like having worked selling
computers before it totally works
oh yeah and like you might even be like
this one is better and someone will read
the numbers on the sheet and be like I
don't care you're trying to upsell me
you're a jerk you're probably getting a
commission finishing novel yeah because
this one says it has more numbers it's
like well then the frustrating thing is
that like they could be right a lot of
the time like I was always the sales guy
that was like I would upsell but I would
upsell because people would walk in
wanting to buy an Athlon 64 3500 plus or
3700 plus or whatever I think the third
700 plus was an ephah I worked with a
different clientele well I was often
down sewing right
yeah so they would walk in and they
would want like I synced like a high-end
single core and I'd be like whoa whoa
hold on okay for a hundred bucks more
you're already spending like five
hundred dollars for a hundred bucks more
I want you to buy this it's an
entry-level dual core you're going to
like it and baby like they'd come in the
next week and they'd be like getting a
new keyboard or something be like holy
crap
I am so glad that people do that and I
spent the extra hundred bucks my buddy
has this one because they'd be like
buying whatever the trend hat or
whatever
it runs circles around it he can't even
believe it
she's going to be in next week to buy
one like yeah dogs what's up I was cool
and like I always liked people getting a
good value even if I didn't necessarily
get them a cheap price because that to
me is what spending your money smartly
is about about not having to replace
something 9 months or 12 months from now
when you could have spent an extra
hundred bucks now to keep it for two or
three years and there's like this
there's some impossible metrics they're
like I hate it when someone will come in
and ask like hey I get out the questions
about that's with my 2600 K oh yeah I
had my 2600 K for a super long time I
was streaming with it doing all this
other kind of stuff and they're like hey
I just bought this processor is this
gonna last me as long when t 600 K it
lasted you and I'm like man that is way
too big of a time frame it's like me to
tell you yes or no I can't give you the
right answer to the wrong question yeah
like this isn't you know I can't I
really can't do this I don't know what
it's like randomly VR raisi new
technology yeah ah yeah
and unlike VR actually like really super
catches on and everyone's doing it and
O'Brien lag and like only processors
within the last two generations are able
to do it because they have some weird
technology on die and yours doesn't have
it and you're now pissed at me because I
said you'd be good for that long like I
can't I really can't do that but like
there are certain things that are rather
obvious like hey dual cores just came
out and look they're like way better at
basically everything then single cores
are no the single most expensive
computer component that I ever bought
for myself was an Athlon 64 4400 plus on
launch yeah like before we were talking
about things being like business
expenses yeah and I also okay you could
probably argue the two 7900 GT exes that
I bought at the same time
but with two products it's two products
and I got those I had the less than a
week because I bought them used off a
guy who was flipping them and was just
like he was moving to crossfire ah at a
time crossfire was bad so he was going
to crossfire and I I got them from him
for like a hundred dollars below market
value each and then I slipped them for
what they were worth so I had them for
like a week just to tool around with
them just to just to bask in what it was
like there on e top-of-the-line SLI
gaming setup and like you know even
though I was following all the rumors
and everything like that the used market
hardware values are not the same as the
retail market they're affected by things
like rumors yes so as soon as a rumor
dropped that something else was coming I
knew that $200 was going to be dropped
off the value those each of them
instantly so I was like I was like
holding on to them like this I was like
I got to get rid of these things I got
to get rid of anything but that didn't
stop me from like playing far cry and
stuff yeah yeah darker one yeah dog ball
man oh man that's great game it was like
there were things that like really irked
me about it like the fact that it had
problem there were organic creatures
that you could hit like six times with a
rocket launcher and they wouldn't die
and like rocket ammo was like every game
it was pretty limited like if I'm
carrying around rocket launcher ammo
like let me use it fun with it a little
bit yeah like it should leave a gaping
crater the size of you know a freaking
football helmet in the side of this
thing at least yeah you know anyway
sorry we wow we are do not hang on topic
Terry well here program in other news
AMD's r7 1700 is in 4th place as well
with that said this was originally
posted by red silver spine on the forum
the rumor that
AMD managed to gain ten point four
percentage points of CPU market share in
the second quarter of twenty six twenty
seventeen is a little misleading because
the data is from a self-selected survey
and they're putting it very mildly here
so the original article is from seeking
alpha here
AMD customers are more likely to
self-report on AMD's increased sales in
market share really Andy Wow I mean to
be clear any fan of any company is
likely to self-report
at a at a rate that's higher than the
actual numbers would be but how do I put
this lightly
AMD fans you guys are at Busey a very
enthusiastic about AMD moving on which
is good what's good
yeah we need arguments on the Internet
more of them at least you know just we
need at least AMD versus Intel AMD
versus Nvidia AMD versus versus our
other AMD yeah and AMD versus just cyrix
alright tesla to build the world's
biggest lithium-ion battery in south
australia this was posted by DISA tech
subbu 11f guy name is that on the form
of the original article is from ABC dot
EU so yeah the headline there is pretty
self-explanatory but basically the point
is that they're promising to build it in
a hundred days or it'll be free and this
world largest lithium-ion battery will
be will be able to store energy or will
be used to store energy from a nearby
wind farm and it's like the the free
thing that would cost them 50 million
dollars yeah
so basically musk has issued a challenge
to his own company to build it in a
reasonable amount of time or eat the
cost of it which will be like huge PR
either way I guess but I think that's a
part of the point is I'm pretty sure
he's sure that he can do it and this is
a marketing stunt essentially for other
countries not necessarily other people
but for other countries yeah I'm like
look we can beef up your infrastructure
superfast and right this is how
confident we are and to be clear this is
a risk on both sides because this is
basically like this is like a bet it's
like if I can build it in a hundred days
you pay for it and if I go over the time
limit I'll pay I'll pay for it yeah Wow
which is pretty wild so this is this is
a crazy stunt for him to get this tech
out there on a much larger scale than
something like a home-based battery
we're sure you're able to take advantage
of off-peak grid power and then use it
during peak hours saves money blah blah
blah da da no no this now we're talking
about taking energy that was stored
while it was windy and using it once the
wind dies down very freakin cool so
South Australia has been battling power
problems since a statewide blackout in
September 2016 and this could really
change the way that renewable energy is
stored so very cool but and we've got
another two-parter here the original
article here is from Batteries
international calm the Germans have
announced that they will be building c4
olds biggest battery in underground
caverns which makes it like even cooler
because it's like the bat tree cave
oh oh yeah you can with that on the spot
yeah gotta be prepped oh that's pretty
good thank you
oh to be fair okay Mustang is apparently
going to take them a hundred days this
crazy battery cave battery is going to
be done by the end of 2023 but it'll be
seven hundred milli watt hour megawatt
hours excuse million hours megawatt
hours compared to just a hundred like a
small anchorman
it's like what it's in a cave
but it is a fizzy German fun it will
work better than the others Hey we
opened up an old bunker and just threw
it in yeah that's right yeah um

hungry I am so you know what no let's do
need for seat first
okay need for seat makers of the max
Nanak line of chairs that you've
probably seen featured on Linus tech
tips many many times especially in my
office so I actually love that chair
yeah um they now have a new service for
their chairs now instead of just having
to you spoiled it you suck in fact I'm
just having a Max nama khlo go
embroidered you can now have Sam your
name which would have come in handy a
lot of times around here with you for
all the times that people have taken my
chair I actually have a label on it it
says lioness chair do not steal didn't
it happen today
with this one even that's embroider yes
it did
so maybe it's not easier to track down
though maybe it's not the solution to
that particular problem so people being
jackasses is not something that
embroidery can solve but at least you
can have like a be a multicolored
embroidery thing on your chair it's
freaking cool they've got tons of
different chairs something for everyone
and they've got a preview tool that
allows you to see what it's going to
look like on the chair
they've got outstanding customer service
and I can speak for the quality of the
products I've been using mine for over
two years now
me too since I did my first review and
other than order - other than my cheap
Costco gene staining the seat blue a
little bit it looks like the day I got
it yeah like I love my chair yeah so
head over to need for seat dot-com and
check out their new embroidery service
today leaving us to our last concert
which which apparently I've seen
multiple people in the chat actually
asking for this one to be on the show
because I think it's entertaining when
we eat hot things alright so I think
it's my turn
your turn hey yeah well in some
delicious stop first okay now get into
it that's true Javad jerky is made with
the best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives the goal was to create a
snack come with full of flavor and spice
that wasn't bad for you the inspiration
comes from the flavor of garlic lime and
cilantro because it brings out the
flavour in premium beef hmm my personal
favorite is maple buffalo bacon which I
think we're out of because I just eat
the entire pack every time we do a spot
but if you're into spicy men do they
ever have a lot of a lot of options well
you're going to hit me with this week
you had me try and this one's good I
love the crack the crack pepper and sea
salt honestly I thought it was pretty
good at first
now I absolutely I just won almost as
much as an opal interesting now so I'm
putting it over on this side so you had
me try all bell pepper the ghost pepper
because you thought it was hotter than
the Reaper so I'm actually gonna and I
tried it and it wasn't that bad so I'm
going to leave it up to you you can go
with the one that is listed as hotter
and I think it's hotter or you can go
with the one that is not listed as
hotter tae-yul I think it's hotter
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do
both okay I'm going to settle the see I
would I was thinking about that but I
didn't want to put that on Oh huh I see
I thought you were going yeah no don't
think they just could you beat around
the bus that you didn't throw me under
it hahahaha all right you were setting
them up you were setting up their
expectation yeah a little bit okay
there might have been some minor social
engineering oh they're not all er that's
a solid piece of jerky right that's a
good-looking piece of jerky that's a
terrifying looking peak looking piece of
you could probably use offer code ltte
and save 10% @ww savage jerky calm okay
we send them a message about the
challenge pack thing I don't think we
remembered we should okay so you go
ahead you do our next next topic here
and I'm going to do the sorry I got some
of the other one stuck in my tooth
not okay I don't want I don't want to
taint it don't want to change it so I'm
gonna do a bite of ghost pepper buffalo
sauce first just to get my tastebuds
going then I'm gonna do one a beach okay
you go ahead and move on to our next
topic I also ate a really spicy one
apparently wearables are tanking jawbone
is liquidating its assets we've kind of
seen this coming for a while even from
your own personal experience how often
is your Smart Watch paired with your
phone just out of an interesting
question you overheard me talking about
the idea yeah but I'm like not even
remote the answer is like almost never
right well I wouldn't say almost never
uh how long has it been here let me fire
up the end gadget source for this one
throw in the chat okay I got it
Jawbone's demise heralds the end of the
wearables industry I think that's a
little sensationalist I don't think
that's necessary a little rough little
bro yeah there's still space for I think
you overheard me talking to Colton yeah
because he asked me who okay I wasn't
expecting to have to talk for the spot
he asked me if I would be comfortable
doing a product placement for a non
SmartWatch where i'm jaring it yeah yeah
yeah I was like he's like yeah I know
you love the SmartWatch and I'm like
yeah so let me put it this way um for
over two weeks I was wearing an Apple
watch that was paired to my iPhone 6 the
one that I only use to listen to music
and watch videos in bed so when I was
actually out and about during the day
like I well obviously wasn't getting
call notifications or text notifications
because it doesn't have a sim in it and
it would only like I'd randomly get like
a bunch of notifications when I got home
like it clearly was not the optimal
experience and it just wasn't even worth
the 5 minutes like I like the SmartWatch
experience I just switched phones so
often that I did it's not that important
I just don't bother yes and like as a
consumer buying these
I would I would buy and I would own one
but if I had an Apple watch I wouldn't
run out and buy the Gentoo so my
experience was because I so nice Mart
watch 3 I believe it was and I think I
made a video on that quite a while ago
only other one okay well so did you just
survive the ghost pepper right what you
thought was hotter okay so I tried the
Sony SmartWatch three I believe it was
quite a while ago made a video on it all
that kind of jazz my issue with that was
we had we had a little thing where like
if you're reviewing a type of product
you should probably use it so I held
onto that one for a little while it's
now back but I found myself the need to
charge it all the time and the fact that
the charging port was under it and under
a silicon thing so I couldn't just like
dock take it off and like drop it on a
dock I had to take it off and like get
under there and probably take it out of
its actual band and then remove the
silicon thing and plug in the little
cable it's like it was just not a very
useable experience and it got to the
point where I would rather take it off
and leave it yeah see that one it's
hotter oh okay
see that one's definitely hotter hold on
give me a sec just let me let the pilot
cleanse a little bit okay so I still
think it's just it's tedious and the
thing is like that steps to make that
experience better requires buying a new
watch and then now I'm now I'm buying
another watch and I wasn't really that
saw it slide with that one and now
that's the current level of watch and I
still don't think it's that great I
think we might get there eventually but
I think we're if that's exactly it
I think demise of wearables is a little
ridiculous I just think that wearables
aren't going to be the slam dunk like
next smartphone like companies like
Samsung or maybe even Apple we're
expecting them to be because they're the
experience right now just isn't worth
five or six or eight hundred dollars
like a premium watch yeah people feel
like is because it's a piece of jewelry
whereas I do think that there are
wearables out there that are more
reasonably priced yeah that can make
sense and I also think that development
will continue and we will get to the
point where
the charging thing is a great point like
if I misaligned my watch and it doesn't
charge that night yeah it doesn't work
the next day also pain in the butt
where when wireless charging gets to the
point where you just kind of throw all
your junk in a bullet the other day yeah
then that's cool that's way way way way
better experience so it needs to be a
lot easier it writing right now I feel
like it's kind of a barrier between
using things but charging it is tedious
making sure it's paired with all your
stuff and Linkedin to all your apps
right now is tedious it's not a seamless
experience through your phone like
there's just too many steps that you
have to constantly redo an X to solve
area to cover the news here this is just
the latest wearable pioneer to throw in
the towel last year pebble sold its
assets to Fitbit in a fire sale that's
for Fitbit they're trading at a 52-week
low so jawbone was actually last valued
at 1.5 billion when they raised 165 mill
in January 2016 despite shuttering their
business they still think they're worth
a significant amount of money due to
pending litigation with Fitbit but the
company has begun the process of
liquidating itself at least in part I
also think that there's probably too
many wearable brands I'm not that
surprised I'm a little surprised at
stepping into jawbone because they've
been around for a long time and that
most of them are just kind of junk from
my experience yeah I mean you were gonna
do sorry ok I hear ya the Apple watch
blahblahblah like you were going to do a
roundup of Fitness wearables yeah
wheat they're only ran out and bought
like six of them super dinky yeah but
like it never happened because well ok
are we the real reason why I shouldn't
happen took way too freaking long ok so
we wanted to pair with a educational
institution at a local university yeah
we want to pair with a local university
because they have a really cool on-site
medical thing where they can like use
proper equipment to properly test
exactly what's going on with your heart
and we didn't want to do it with like
just some fitness band because I wanted
absolutely as accurate as I could get
because I wanted this to be an actual
thing that people could point at when
debating the vibe
bility of fitness watches yeah and they
were interested but they wanted to
launch these videos along with something
that they were working on and then it
took them like they said it was going to
take a few months end up taking them
like six months I still sort of
contacted them and they were like okay
well we're not really launching this
thing in the same way as before we can
still work with you on it but how much
are you willing to pay us how much you
willing to let me hey us how much you
willing to pay us to use a facility how
much are you willing to pay us use the
consumables how much are you willing to
pay us for our time per person that has
to be there here's all the people that
have to be there basically it wasn't a
partnership anymore yeah they were
looking for like a many thousands of
dollars paycheck to run this testing
that was only existing for the sake of
for the like we weren't going to be
making that kind of money on it like no
we're going to make like a couple
hundred bucks on Adsense and we invested
a lot in buying all the watches part of
the idea of the video we're not we were
investing in a video crew and editing
and all that stuff but like we bring to
the table and it was going to be
exposure for their program like they
were just they were not being partners
about it at all and it was it was
supposed to be a like absolutely a pro
health video which is why we wanted to
work with a health focused Institute
because it was supposed to address the
idea of people over exercising and I
know that sounds kind of weird because
it's not usually the problem that exists
but the problem that they were trying to
address was rather old people my 80s 90s
year old people that we're trying to
stay fit and that's awesome but going
too hard at it and stressing out their
hearts like going for extended very
extended bike rides every single day
right and it was just too stressful on
their hearts but they were looking at
these smartwatches and going oh I'm
still within the training zone right but
that doesn't even if that is accurate
which it's my probably I don't really
know if I'm going to say that it is it
still doesn't account for a lot of other
things that can be going on with your
heart that can be super bad even if
you're in the training zone there can be
other things going on but then you drop
down a lot of research in terms of hard
stuff yes yeah but people trust this
thing and they go oh it's saying that
I'm doing well there forever
is going well but the heart's not as
complicated as just as fast as going so
people trust been around it more
complicated yeah yeah and the fitbit's
congratulating them and giving them
gamified feedback about how well they're
doing when the heart can't take this
much stress because they're old and it
can't so we were trying to help address
that also point at like amount of steps
that's happening and pointed how stupid
that is and we had a really cool shot
where we were in a bus in Mexico and my
step counter was just going like mad
because there was all these bumps right
so that we were going to address how
inaccurate these things are but it just
never ended up working out okay I have
the answer
so the reaper is hotter on the tail end
okay so it leaves a more extended burn
yeah okay whereas the ghost pepper
probably has a hotter initial burn it'll
bit of a punch but what I'll say is that
this is the most of either of them that
I've been able to eat in one sitting one
my naming tolerance yeah like I've
always and shows like I've always said
in the past they're delicious
yeah but I can only handle like a bite
yeah oh wow
oh that's like a full sized piece and a
half now if you told it all together
right I'm feeling good that's crazy
these are freaking delicious they are
they're even better once you see we're
off the sponsor spot just in case people
are wondering but like yeah mad at Timmy
so they should okay they should offer
two different things now and we should
like absolutely contact them about this
there should be the challenge pack I'm a
tolerance pack and the tolerance pack
and the tolerance the tolerance
subscription maybe where like it sends
you you you pick where your start is on
the line yeah and then it'll send you
them like the same kind for like a month
and then you get upgraded up one heat
tear and then it sends you the same kind
for like a month and then you get
upgraded and you have to try to like it
yeah all right so the original article
here is from TechCrunch
and it finally happened yep pornhub has
built-in support for interactive toys
huh
this is a great meme right here this
image is not related to the text because
I don't think techCrunch's is edgy
enough to put in an image that is
related to the text here maybe not sure
that one
so Lauren Adia was a little bit more
than enough oh yeah my stomach is still
working on it but okay if someone no
one's going to do this but if someone
went back to like the first time that we
had a savage turkey sponsorship oh yeah
I just don't kill me me too yeah it's
attacking them we're getting back so
Canada's porn mega site pornhub has
launched a new series of videos that
sync with a user's interactive sex toy
to make it a more intimate experience
both visually and physically and
something that I referenced a little
while ago on a win show that you weren't
here for yeah was that I'm still
subscribed for like the oculus subreddit
stuff like that and I've seen a the
percentage of time that I post hits the
front page that is about
not-safe-for-work topics seems to be I
don't know if this is 100% accurate but
it seems to be to my perceptions without
diving too far into it increasing over
time as interest in VR decreases because
the people that are are still interested
in it a lot of them are using it for not
safe or work stuff and pornhub is saying
that their VR category is doing very
well I'm actually not that surprised a
million plus views per day yeah I don't
even think there were that many of you
our headsets out there I mean sometimes
I mean here we are more than one video
who knows fair enough and it's all in
how you define a view yes like if you
just like okay yeah skip the first step
you know else alright yeah skip to the
end so here we go yeah is that a view I
don't know probably important terms it
probably goes yeah yeah all right
so yeah I think that's pretty much it
yeah really
sound someone's not really that
interesting okay the hackers doing a
thing oh this is ridiculous
original article here from Ars Technica
posted by WM groom a k1 Drive has
stopped working on non NTFS drives fat
discs are no longer supported and more
surprisingly neither is the new ress
file system oh oh oh okay now just to be
clear it can still get yeah I had a
little bit there go down the wrong pipe
okay that's particularly ouch but
basically okay why don't you do this one
the onedrive thing okay yeah so to
continue to use the software files will
need to be stored on an NTFS volume you
saw the error that was on Linus's screen
I'm going to bring it back up there you
go so it will warn you so that it must
be formatted with NTFS filesystem
now the thing that sucks about that is
you have to move all of that stuff off
format your drive and move it back which
is like super lame yeah if you're buying
storage space yeah that's like safe so
you don't have to have it duplicated
because that's the thing with with the
like scale of that mortgage
infrastructure thing where you have it
in like three different locations in two
different formats in blah blah blah you
would have to retain that while moving
things off of the NTFS systems on - wait
no off of the whatever other systems on
- NTFS systems and what you're probably
going to be doing is wanting to keep
your current infrastructure and just
format it so you'd be moving it off to
something they're gonna have to trust
very likely in the cloud whether it's
AWS or something else because you don't
- permanently by all these drives and
then moving all of it back which is not
just tedious but it's expensive super
freaking annoying I'm going to move us
off oh we're already off so you guys
don't have to look at that ads it's now
online is the screen looking back at
NTFS is the default system for Windows
but people using SD cards to extend the
store
on small laptops and tablets and knucks
that's a big thing right now so a lot of
people that have business II computers
that they mount on the back of monitors
those are commonly knucks these days I
know a while ago they were all the zotac
can trim the name of it right now
but zoton box yeah he died but they're
commonly knucks these days a lot of
people expand the storage on nuts with
SD cards so yeah basically it's terrible
and it's yet another reason not to use
onedrive because Google Drive works and
people often using storage spaces to
manage large redundant storage volumes
will often use our EFS storage spaces
their own thing yeah Oh in other news
this was posted by Jamie's cone on the
forum red apparently in terms of the
phone one quick thing before we go yeah
apparently the company's position is
that onedrive should always have warned
about these usage scenarios that it's
only a bug or an oversight that it was
allowed that it was allowed to be used
on non NTFS volumes at all which is just
bogus but anyways yes red announced the
phone lines is going always going for
the sea salt that makes a lot of sense
yeah red is announcing a phone it's a
very very expensive phone costing
roughly these are subject to change
either fifteen hundred ninety five
dollars to the titanium version or one
thousand one hundred and ninety five
dollars for the aluminium version which
is just nuts is a 5.7 inch holographic
display it runs Android the handset
screen can seamlessly switch between
traditional 2d content and holographic
3d content such as games it will support
hydrogen for view content a file type
that red has produced and content will
be stored via that content will be
stored via the red channel which allows
users to stream holographic games and
movies that it's nuts ready saying that
it may struggle to fill orders very
unsurprisingly due to the display
production limitations of making like
this holographic display and stuff that
can support hydrogen for view
content they're not telling us almost
anything about specs no we can assume
that the camera was pretty cool yeah if
you look at the picture which you should
be able to get by jumping in there I had
it open here the camera is fairly
prominently displayed up at the top
there yeah and you gotta look I could
make I actually don't have a reasonably
thin I like the grip on the side if you
compare to the size of the yes I like
your phone side too if you compare to
the size of the headphone jack it
doesn't look that thick no there's some
type of docking port style thing on the
bottom near where the type C is there's
a huge red logo on what look there
that's their limo connector yeah okay so
this right here is looks like it's to
attach it so that so they're not telling
us a lot about specs like in terms of
processor could it act as a display for
your camera that yes yeah okay
they're advertising that you can use it
as a display for a red camera okay so
that's assuming you want to spend the
$200 for the cable and the $200 for the
bracket that sits on that dock yes red
there you go
and the one for your camera so 600 $600
$300 each for those parts I actually
have another you heard it here first
folks I have another holy episode
coming
featuring an overpriced red product dude
if you just you can get infinite holy
 views just buy every single thing
that ready oh yeah I mean I don't even
know if this phone's going to be a
review I bought one by the way so I
bought one and not because I plan to
keep it I plan to flip it though yeah
but I bought one so that we can do a
video on it because we go back real
quick red doesn't sample for Jack one
thing I wanted to point out is like the
the phone's on kind of a weird angle and
stuff but you can kind of figure out how
big that red digital cinema hydrogen
logo thing is yeah and that looks like a
relatively similar size to the camera
that's up at the top so that camera is
huge it's also a little hard to tell
from the perspective but this looks
lower profile than this heatsink it
looks like a race which looks below that
which also still has a camera bump yeah
that camera might be like dope AF pretty
massive which is cool actually that's
really cool because as of right now I
play one game on my phone I use it for
messaging services mainly email
and I Tamara that's pretty much it all
right um blah blah blah some boring
legal battle some others pain some other
thing and I think that's pretty much it
for the Lanzhou ray so thank you guys
very much for tuning in and if you were
wondering if you're not already signed
up for floatplane Oh a little plane
right now yeah we're gonna go through it
yes very good dying so on slow plane now
is the mezzanine on update the office is
in shambles
that was actually kind of interesting
the permits have stalled construction is
not moving forward at the rate that we
would have liked right now and
everything around here is in such
horrendous condition that it is killing
me a little bit of a behind-the-scenes
look at what it's like to work basically
in a construction zone yep trying to
film professional videos no but those
with like while increasing production
quality but the feedback on our videos
lately has been great speaking of which
where's that one video that I like a lot
there it is
okay so this video turning turning scrap
electronics into gold bars is like we're
signing up for club playing club over
it's freaking amazing it's it's one of
my favorite videos of any kind from any
creator that I've watched in a while and
I had no idea that it was coming and I'm
not just saying that like if you wait
till it comes on YouTube that's fine
watch it it's an amazing video but I
would suggest checking out on floatplane
it'll look better anyways and sound
better so there's that yeah but it's an
amazing video it doesn't feel
necessarily 100% like a lot of the
content that we make yeah it's much more
like deep dive into something really
interesting and informative it's very
professional piece I think it's super
cool there are no dick jokes no um which
is like we also reviewed what is
hands-down the best value gaming
notebook we've ever checked out now this
is the predator Helios 300 we've got our
review of ek waterboxxes aluminum gaming
products ice-cream gaming products water
cooling products but of course you can
water cool a gaming machine Tech cookies
phone tethering as fast as possible
and why does your internet connection
randomly stop working this is a bangin
video oh yeah
the intro to this is fantastic
the ultimate DIY arcade machine guides
so that's the arcade machine that is
behind us right now you should blow it
up and play umm just generally alan alan
keyes them alright ah we checked out the
main gear element acts like the most
amazing looking gaming machine we have
ever reviewed yeah this thing is
unbelievable like yeah engine a detail
give main gear like basically on a
limited budget and tell them to water
cool things with hardline and it'll look
amazing yeah I know right we've got our
Asus veterus review is up so that's the
thinnest GT X 1080 gaming laptop

mouse to studio tour actually just went
up on YouTube so that's uh so that's
everything that's up on flow plane right
now but not yet up on YouTube you know
we've actually even after scrapyard Wars
interest in floatplane like people seem
to be feeling like it's a pretty good
value yeah we've lost some subs which we
knew because you scrapyard Wars hype but
we are actually gaining new ones at the
same rate that we're leading them
already
which is pretty cool which is actually
really cool so I'm just going to post
that in twitch chat where you guys can
go sign off if you want to and that's
pretty much it
