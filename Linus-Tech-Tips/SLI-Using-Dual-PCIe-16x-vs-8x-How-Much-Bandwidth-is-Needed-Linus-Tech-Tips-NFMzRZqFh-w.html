benchmark in this case 3dmark 11 to
evaluate something that I have received
a lot of questions about over the years
so what you may or may not notice is
that I have changed my test bench I have
gone with an Intel X 58 platform for
this particular test I'm using the
gigabyte g1 gorilla motherboard you guys
better look at that g1 gorilla
motherboard with an Intel Core i7 960 so
that is a quad core processor I've got
that chip clocked at 4 gigahertz in
order to reduce the any CPU bottlenecks
that may occur in a my test and now ok
no do not always ask before opening this
file so what I'm going to be looking at
today is the effect of PCI Express band
width on SLI performance so you can see
I have not used the top slot and there's
a very good reason for that if I
populate the top slot then it will run
at 16x bandwidth and then if I populate
the second slot I will have two cards
running at 16x bandwidth if I populate
these two slots I will have two cards
running at here we are PCIe 16 at 8 X
bandwidth so I'm just going to switch to
the other card and show you guys here so
there you are at 8 I expand with so that
is what we're going to test I'm going to
see what the 3 mark score is writing in
these two slots versus these two slots
so you guys can see how much of the
difference there is in performance okay
so for my first run-through we got X 3 3
8 6 3380 6 3d marks in 3d mark 11 so now
let's run them at 16x and see what kind
of performance boost we get from giving
them the fall available bandwidth our
two card configuration running the same
test achieves 3389 3dmark so for
comparison at 8 X + 8 X bandwidth we
achieved 3300 and
eighty-six 3d marks so we oh hold on
hold on oh no we should put an ad on
three three eight nine okay divided by
three three eight six to find out the
performance improvement point zero zero
zero a one-mile rather that's a point
zero one percent performance improvement
by going from 68 X 8 X 2 16 X 16 X pcie
2.0 slots so to anyone who wants to run
SLI or crossfire on the Intel P 67
platform I guess this means you're
pretty safe from performance degradation
even with high performance GPUs like the
GTX 580 thank you for checking out this
