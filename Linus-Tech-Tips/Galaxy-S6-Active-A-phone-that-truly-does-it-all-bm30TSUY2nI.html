with their s6 lineup first with the edge
whose stellar looks unique curved screen
and phenomenal camera would have
captured me as a user if it wasn't for
its average at best battery life and now
with the s6 active it looks like they've
addressed my one complaint but is it
enough for me to switch from the droid
turbo drop the like on this video by the
way if you're stoked to see the results
from our GPU boosts 2.0 investigation
with six gtx titan x graphics cards and
seeing how they perform against each
other under identical conditions
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their all-new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more the
Galaxy s6 active features an 8 core
Exynos 7420 processor with a Mallee t760
GPU 3 gigs of ram and 32 gigabytes of
on-board
unfortunately non expandable storage the
screen is a beautiful 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED Corning Gorilla Glass 4 covered
affair that boasts a resolution of 2560
by 1440 and infinite contrast since the
black pixels are actually turned off
outright and man I love the screens on
s6 phones that I've used and above that
you'll find a 5-megapixel selfie camera
to go along with the 16 megapixel main
camera that also records in ultra HD for
video sounds pretty familiar right well
it should because under the hood the
galaxy s6 active is really not very
different from its siblings a really
nice change from previous active SKUs
which toned down the flagship specs of
the regular ones in exchange for its
additional ruggedness which isn't to say
it's identical there are some small
differences like the fact that it's
available in only one capacity instead
of having 64 or 128 gig options and
cannot be bought pre equipped with
wireless charging and there are some
major differences like the fact that the
active does not feature a fingerprint
sensor and that it comes equipped with a
massive 3,500 milliamp hour battery
that's enough for even me to get through
the day love it once you go big battery
there's just no going back I mean these
days I laugh at people who have slim
sleek phones and big stupid battery
banks in their pockets that they have to
keep them plugged into which I guess
leads us into the physical tour doesn't
it this is a love it or hate it design
my friends while I personally love the
looks I've actually never seen it in
person without the sexy D brand skin
that those guys put on before they sent
it over so that weird Arctic camo thing
never had a chance to bug me
and life isn't just about looks anyway
what use is like a lady who looks great
but like falls out of your arms every
time you try to give her a hug and that
unfortunately was my experience with the
s6 active well I never actually did drop
it
the awkwardly positioned multitask
button way over here and the boxy design
not to mention the higher than usual
weight made it more difficult to manage
for my small hands then even phones that
are slightly bigger and thicker like my
daily driver Droid turbo the good thing
is that this particular lady is super
duper ruggedly built at the back is an
ever so slightly raised border around
the camera bump with the flash and
regrettably rear mounted speaker being
the only other features on the back I
mean look at the speakers not that bad
it's just rear mounted so basically the
worst possible position at the front are
the hardware home back and multitasking
buttons that are a huge turnoff for many
users for that I actually found more
convenient than capacitive buttons in
this position since they're stiff enough
to require a fairly decisive click so I
never accidentally pressed them while
holding the phone in landscape
orientation to watch a movie and not
much else on the front either around the
edges are a microUSB port on the bottom
supporting quick charge a headphone jack
on the top in mic referred position a
horrible lock button on the right that
sticks out about four miles from the
chassis and that this thing is super
easy to press by accident so real pain
in the butt and until you manually
disable this function and software it
actually hangs up the phone if you bump
it during a call and then there's also a
poorly positioned volume rocker
seriously it's nearly impossible to hit
one without the other
with a cool multifunction button right
above that which acts as a shutter when
you're in the camera app and can be
programmed to perform a variety of other
functions with a single press or a hold
from within the settings menu neat now
what some of you might have noticed is
that in spite of the s6 actives ip68
dust and water resistance rating of one
and a half meters for thirty minutes to
go along with its salt sole
radiation thermal shock and vibration
resistance
I mean hey you might need vibration
resistance I'm not I'm not judging it
has no lame
you know rubber flaps or anything like
that all buttons microphone speakers
jacks and even the tool is SIM tray are
always sealed an implementation that
just feels much more trustworthy to me
so let's talk then about general usage
experience well it's a galaxy s6 with
stormtrooper armor essentially so
generally speaking performance was great
the camera is magnificent with both the
rear and selfie cameras just delivering
some truly stunning results I mean look
at this shot of me sitting in a darkened
room writing this review on my laptop
versus the droid turbo another decent
phone and TouchWiz has improved so much
that I don't feel like it's a knock
against a device anymore so kudos for
that Samsung but there were a few things
that bugged me this time around anyway
first the s6 active has got an
unbelievable amount of bloatware on it
disable all that stuff before you even
set up the phone I mean seriously while
tangent Games milk video AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
what is this crap and and don't tell me
in the comments what it is I don't care
I don't want it on the phone it
shouldn't be there
another weird thing and maybe it's just
mine so guys let me know this one in the
comments if your experience is different
is that double taps only register like
70 to 80 percent of the time for me when
I go really fast which caused a lot of
typos in words with double letters for
me and then finally we've got a couple
of TouchWiz annoyances number one never
tell me what I can and cannot do with
the battery life left on my phone
Samsung disables the camera under 5%
causing me to miss a great picture
opportunity with my baby girl not cool
and to please fix the trusted devices on
that lock like if you have a wearable or
something like that you need to press to
wake then there's no way to disable the
stupid swipe to unlock I never noticed
on the edge because I was always just
using the fingerprint reader anyway but
this was kind of annoying on this phone
I have a trusted device so I don't have
to have a screen unlock which doesn't
mean that I don't
like the phone the s6 active lives up to
its name it's a phone for people who use
their phone rather than just admiring it
and while I don't plan to switch because
I prefer the extra 10% greater battery
capacity and the gestures of the droid
turbo like flicking for the flashlight
and wiggling for the camera
I wouldn't criticize anyone for picking
up an s6 active instead of a regular s6
as long as they know what they're
getting themselves into because that is
both the appeal of Android and its
Achilles heel the s6 active is just
different enough from other Android
devices to make it a contender for me
it's and it's great to have that choice
but because it's a weird carrier
exclusive model and therefore a
relatively low volume one it is already
lagging behind other s6 is when it comes
to software support a problem that's
often difficult to properly overcome
since the more obscure your devices the
lower the chance that any one
manufacturer or indie developer will be
working on new Android updates for it so
that makes the answer to should you get
one fairly straightforward if you like
it exactly the way it is then I give it
a massive thumbs up in fact I'm
switching my wife over to it because
we're one mA it's battery life and
camera are driving her up the wall and
for baby owners and this phone is
perfect thanks to its stellar camera and
durability but if you're expecting it to
continue to evolve over time then I
might not take the plunge speaking of
taking the plunge head over to D brand
comm slash Linus active if you guys want
to learn more about deep brand and the
awesome skins that they offer for phones
game consoles controllers laptops all
kinds of cool stuff their vinyl skins
serve a couple of purposes number one is
they look great you don't have to get
white you can get all kinds of different
finishes and different colors definitely
check out the variety actually our LG g4
video has a great showcase of all the
different finishes on the same foam
backing so that's pretty cool
and the other purpose they serve is
additional durability so if you're
worried about you know an incidental
drop scratching your phone or something
like that a vinyl skin
they cost a few bucks so if you scratch
it rip it off replace it it leaves no
residue and you can put them on quite
quickly the last thing that's great
about deep brown skins is the fit and
finish of their vinyl skins they spend a
lot of time on the fit and finish and
they go on absolutely flawlessly so
check it out that's deep brand calm
slash Linus acted it's linked in the
video description and give it a try see
if you want to you know personalize one
of your things that needs a vinyl wrap
