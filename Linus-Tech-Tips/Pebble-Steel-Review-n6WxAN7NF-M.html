DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts this isn't my
first experience with the pebble
ecosystem and you can find my original
review in the video thumbnail here but
if you don't feel like watching that
I'll summarize for you the pebble is one
of those few products that changed the
way I go about my daily life the App
Store has improved the product further
since my original review with easy
access to apps for better music control
forcing your phone during when you can't
find it and much more stuff like that
and even better but even though I'm not
a heavy app user worth every penny only
begins to describe how I felt about my
vanilla pebble so for the first time
pretty much ever I ordered the pebble
steel the second I heard about it
instead of waiting to see if it was good
and here's my review of the unit I
bought that ended up being delayed five
months because of a shipping address
mix-up that to pebbles credit they did
eventually resolve to my satisfaction
speaking of things they resolved to my
satisfaction my original pebble actually
started glitching out around the same
time my steel arrived and while it's
disappointing that the screen is
displaying gobbledygook a lot of the
time it is actually still somewhat
usable and after a couple quick messages
to their support they're shipping me a
new one and I don't even appear to have
to send the original back so two thumbs
up for saving me the cost of shipping
the unit onto the steel now I think the
packaging actually says just about
everything there is to say about this
product versus the original
it looks great feels premium and the
message that it gets across is hey we
may still be the same company with the
same basic product but we're all
grown-up now
check us out and that's what steel is
compared to the original pebble the main
stuff hasn't changed it has the same
sized
eing display with unchanged contrast and
resolution things I'd like to see
upgraded in a future revision the
battery life is the same the button
layout is the same it's still waterproof
the Bluetooth connectivity is unchanged
and it's still compatible with all the
same apps the improvements are all in
the design which is great because let's
face it
owners most of the comments we get about
our watches sound more like thick is
that versus oh wow that's great what is
it there's a big difference now that
changes the steel is available in matte
black or brushed stainless steel and
both bottles ship with a leather strap
pre attached and a metal wrist band that
was a touch big for me out of the box
but has an included screwdriver and the
ability to shorten it so I was able to
resize it and swap it myself pebble
doesn't recommend doing this yourself
but aside from the pins being extremely
tight online I had a pretty hard time
with that I didn't have too much
difficulty and this guide here got me
through it in about 20 minutes now that
I've tried both I think I'm gonna stick
with the metal band for now honestly
they're both great and whichever one you
like better is a hundred percent of
personal choice
the leather one is lighter not
waterproof and feels a bit more casual
while the steel one feels aside from the
added weight and bulk a slightly more
comfortable on my risk with the
waterproofness being a nice touch so
there's the pros and cons of each of
those moving past the strap the watch
face itself has gotten a nice upgrade to
its smaller overall with cleaner
straighter lines the bezel is smaller
particularly on the top and bottom the
buttons are closer together with a nicer
tactile feel to them and the front
plastic of the original pebble has been
replaced with Gorilla Glass a welcome
upgrade I mean I may not do hard manual
labor every day but I do work with my
hands sometimes like even just in
computers and I have scratched the
bejesus out of my original pebble this
should hold up much better
the last upgrade is actually pretty
minor one there's a little RGB LED for
charge status indication and app
developers I guess can make use of it at
some point but I haven't seen any news
posted about it in the last few months
correct me if I'm wrong
so um looks like it hasn't really been
used much yet which closes out the
positive points that I'm going to make
in this review and leads well into my
one complaint pebble seriously you
change the charging cable it's one thing
to have a proprietary charging connector
Apple does it and I accept the way they
do it because not only is the lightning
Stan
they developed infinitely better than
the microUSB one that everyone else is
using but they also don't change it on
us every year pebble what the heck Meg
I really hope this doesn't turn into a
trend and I hope that they've given this
iteration a little bit more thought for
the future so I don't need to run out
and buy new charging cables every time I
upgrade my watch to the latest and
greatest as I'm very likely to do unless
Apple knocks it out of the park with the
I watching the iPhone 6 or the Moto 360
really blows me away overall I like
their charging cable I like that it's
magnetic I like that it's easy to use
but I just really wish they wouldn't
change it all the time and I guess
that's pretty much it
I loved the pebble the steel is even
better because it doesn't attract as
many weird stares I know a lot of you
noticed that I was using another
SmartWatch for a while there to be
perfectly honest the only reason I was
wearing it for so long without reviewing
it was that I was really busy and
couldn't find time to get it working
properly so I just kept leaving it on my
wrist to remind myself to tinker with it
when I had a moment and right now I'm
waiting to hear back from their support
I still haven't gotten it working so you
may see a review on that one when the
software improves but for now pebble
still my go-to my experience hasn't been
without its rough patches as I outlined
at the beginning of this video but
they've managed to make it right every
time and quite frankly aside from the
product support has to be a factor when
you buy things and up to this point I'm
a very satisfied customer so guys like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it I hope you enjoyed my
review of the pebble steel and the
difference in the experience I know I
didn't really cover that much about
actually using the thing quite frankly
once again it hasn't changed that much
