thinnest not to be confused with the
2012 HP Envy Spectre one and at a mere
ten point four millimeters it is the
thinnest notebook on the planet not that
we're saying it couldn't still be sexy
if it wasn't because on that note then
is thin the only factor when it comes to
sex appeal or could the spectre have
weaknesses that lurk beneath its
unblemished glowing skin that overshadow
its strengths let's find out
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so the new West
Specter sports an aluminum and carbon
fiber construction with a pleasing
metallic Brown I mean I don't know
there's probably a fancy lipstick word
for this and a shiny gold ghetto booty
accent at the back that gives it a look
that won't go particularly well with my
sense of style but that certainly hits
the elegant and sophisticated mark if
that's what HP was aiming for simplicity
is the name of the game here and on top
we find HP's redesigned logo I did poke
fun at it on Instagram but I actually
really liked it and not a whole lot else
on the bottom are the air intakes for
the hyperbaric cooling system that HP
has borrowed from Intel and some
non-slip feet on the right side we find
nothing on the left side we find nothing
on the front we find nothing but an
indent for the one finger operated and
very stealthy hinge and finally around
back we're treated to an IO selection
that looks a lot more barren than it
actually is so far right is a headphone
microphone combo Jack far left is a
type-c connector that handles USB three
five gigabit connectivity and power
input for the included 45 watt adapter
then in the middle is where things get
very interesting these type-c ports are
both packing Thunderbolt three heat
meaning they can drive 4k DisplayPort
monitors a daisy chain of up to six
supported devices each USB 3 10 gigabit
per second or they can actually act as
alternate power inputs if you had a
bulky device to plug in and want it to
put it over in the edge 1 this is a lot
better than the current generation
MacBook and it's wimpy single type-c USB
five gigabit connector that requires a
hub or a dongle to plug in anything
while charging but I criticized Apple
for sacrificing functionality to the
thin and light gods and wily
peas sacrifice is not quite as extreme
they're not going to get away completely
unscathed here first though let's talk
hardware specs inside the spectres tiny
frame HP has managed to cram and Intel
Core i5 6200 u so that's a hyper
threaded dual core at 2.3 to 2.8
gigahertz eight gigs of LP ddr3 memory
256 gigs of PCIe storage a 2 by 2 AC
wireless solution a 38 watt hour
lithium-ion hybrid battery and four
bangin Olufsen approved speakers with
core i7 models with up to 512 gigs of
storage also available and I have to
give credit where credit is due here
while the spectre might lose a bit of
the premium feel that normally comes
with using high-end materials like
aluminum and carbon fiber
thanks to HP's mission to keep weight
and thickness down to a minimum it's
obvious that tremendous care and
attention went into the execution of
this device the screen is bright
beautiful and rocking a very uniform IPS
panel that lacks touch but whose strong
contrast performance makes it look
better than the mere 1080p resolution
would suggest and I still believe 1080p
is enough at 13 inches the speakers
while not especially loud manage their
full range without any noticeable
distortion and without causing
unpleasant vibrations elsewhere in the
chassis a frequent problem with thin and
light notebooks and most surprisingly
the keyboard is a joy to use with this
satisfying stiffness at the top of the
keystroke that makes the travel feel
longer than it is this is right up there
with my favorite notebook keyboards from
both a speed and accuracy perspective
especially impressive considering the
thickness of the device overall but not
all the news is great the cooling
solution works really well at room
temperature keeping the fan off in idle
and light load conditions and reasonably
quiet even under full load but in spite
of the hyperbaric cooler which by the
way is just a fancy way of saying high
static pressure intake fans versus the
standard exhaust fan configuration
sitting in the bedroom of my
and house or going out into our
warehouse on a 28 degree celcius day
yielded some pretty unpleasant surface
temperatures even at idle in the default
cool control fan profile with the high
performance one forcing the fairly whiny
fans to work quite a bit harder even my
blade 14 not known as a particularly
cool running device was noticeably
better in this regard to be clear this
isn't a huge shot against it I mean the
CPU is much faster than what you'd find
in a MacBook and never thermal throttled
in my testing but if you live somewhere
hot it is something you should be aware
of as is the inclusion of McAfee live
safe on the kind of low-power machine
that manages to sit between five and 10
percent CPU usage while idling at the
desktop
other than that the bloatware
installations were really not that bad
the webcam is super mediocre something
that I wish wasn't true of any device
that's advertised as being for business
use on a manufacturer's website and the
click pad while gesture enabled
frustrated me with its inability to
register left clicks when you touch the
very edge of the pad during two-handed
operation though with that said it has
boatloads of customization options and
as long as your name isn't Linus
Sebastian you'll probably get it working
just fine for you as long as you don't
mind the below average size which I
guess draws us perfectly then into the
conclusion the last time I looked at a
somethingest laptop in the world it was
the gram and I praised LG for finding a
unique identity for their product and
seeing it through even if it meant some
compromises that hurt usability but what
was different about what LG did was that
instead of beating out the competition
by a hair in a way that's not really
noticeable day-to-day while hurting the
everyday convenience of the device a
single type a port would have helped a
lot here they crushed the competition I
mean the grand is 10% lighter than even
the specter whose screen is two inches
smaller diagonally in a way that stands
out much more to me than another thin
and light even though it's the thinnest
one yet
with that said HP's target customer is
not me
that much was obvious from the moment
that I wanted to plug in a mouse and a
Yubikey for multi-factor authentication
and needed to search high and low for
another adapter separate from the one
that they helpfully by the way do
include in the box but while it would be
easy for me then to say we'll just buy
the razor blade stealth that makes a lot
more sense I mean if I'm carrying a
laptop already
what's another two millimeters for
higher performance a touchscreen and a
more premium feel
the stealth also completely misses the
style mark for the young professional
demographic that HP appears to be
targeting with the specter and that's
something that I think they nailed so if
you're a yuppie or a jockey or whatever
it is that they call them these days and
it's between this and a MacBook I'd say
take the specter for sure and you know
what else I'd take for sure a look at
master opcom they've got all kinds of
great deals and the principle is pretty
simple mass drop has this massive
community of people who want to buy cool
stuff but don't want to pay full price
and they've got great connections with
authorized distributors and directly
with manufacturers who want to sell
stuff to those people so they bring
together they go hey we've got a bunch
of people who want to buy it can you
lower the price they go hey we got a
lower price
y'all want to buy it everybody freaking
wins and they've even gone a step
further beyond that very successful
formula and collaborated with certain
manufacturers to create mass drop
Edition products and the one that we're
highlighting today is the k7 xx mass
drop Edition headphones from AKG now if
you're not familiar with that particular
headphone it's the same as the k7 xx
that I checked out in my video which you
can look at up here but in a nutshell
they were configured by mass dropped and
manufactured by AKG they're open backed
headphones with large cushiony ear cups
genuine leather on the headbands and
memory foam ear pads with the lure
covering they've got a two-year warranty
which is covered by mass drop and you
can order from anywhere but a $25 fee
will be assessed on international orders
still a pretty darn good deal though
check it out at the link in the video
