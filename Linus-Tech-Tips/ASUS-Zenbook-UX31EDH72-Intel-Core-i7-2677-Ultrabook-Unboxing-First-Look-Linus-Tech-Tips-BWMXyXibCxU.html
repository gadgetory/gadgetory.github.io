very exciting and I am excited to bring
you this exciting new unboxing from the
exciting channel Linus tech tips which
does unboxings reviews and other
computer videos this is an unboxing but
we're also gonna do an overview of the
unit in general here is some packaging
and here is other more different
packaging so the Zen book is part of a
new class of notebooks which is called a
thin and light no it's called a thinner
and lighter no wait it's called an
ultrabook
yes so an ultrabook is thinner and
lighter than a thin in light and
basically refers to a class of notebooks
that is thinner and lighter than a thin
light yes totally circular blabbing
right now while I get the packaging
opened so the most obvious competitor
for the Zen book is the macbook air
although there are other PC guys who
will be releasing ultra books in the
near future great packaging actually
reminiscent of the way Apple does the
macbook air which we also unboxed so
here we are
Zen book mu I can already see it has USB
3 which is better than the MacBook Air
I'll hold the MacBook Air a thunderbolt
which is better than the Zen but so
let's just give them both some time to
reveal their strengths and weaknesses
and we will go from there so let's find
out what comes in this little package
here we are going to find a USB
connector attached to an Ethernet port
AHA so you can run a wire nut network
out of the box on this end book
fascinating next we have oh look at that
a little mini connector to VGA you can
run a VGA external monitor out of the
box on the Zen book Advantage Zen books
so far next we have a power adapter that
looks a little something like this
actually fairly similar to the way that
the MacBook Air does things except the
MacBook Air does have the option to
instead extend this cable and make it
even longer and not too
yup as much space in your power brick so
advantage MacBook Air all right what
else we got in here oh it comes with a
case that is a big advantage then but
because we all know Apple accessories
are not cheap so here we are it comes oh
you know remember those commercials
where they shows you the air fits in an
envelope a Seuss thought to provide you
with an envelope so you can do that demo
all day every day for all of your
friends go ahead let's that bad boy in
there and that is how much face and a
Suzanne book will take up okay don't
worry we're gonna keep going here what
else we got for documentation here
Zenbook branding they're pretty nice
okay inside we find a battery notice hmm
something caution do not dispose of in
fire do not put in water do not eat it
that kind of stuff okay next we have a
cable tie Thank You a soos very elegant
very not macbook air like alright next
we have a notebook warranty card here's
a big advantage isus because you get
look at that complimentary one-year
accidental damage protection plan BAM
you must register within 60 days from
the date of purchase and follow the
simple steps but you get accidental
damage protection that includes water
electricity broken screen and fire
doesn't cover acts of God however okay
okay so what else we got here 12-month
limited on a complete unit 24 months the
new purchase Monday okay this is just
general stuff okay so that's not that
useful you know on the accidental damage
warranty bit system recovery DVD
fascinating next we have a notebook
user's manual as well as an LCD cleaning
cloth advantage Zen book alright and
let's go ahead and get the Zen book
taken back out of its envelope here and
let's check it out so it is also
slightly lighter than the MacBook Air so
these are both I'm comparing both the 13
point three inch models so the Zenbook
is yeah I'm cheating I have a cheat
sheet down there is one point three
kilograms and the MacBook Air is one
point three five kilograms which
actually holding on to the unit's
doesn't feel that significant to be
perfectly honest but that's okay I mean
every advantage counts right
all right let's check out the overall
form factor so I'm gonna do my my
traditional iPhone size comparison so
there it is at its thickest point here
it is at its thinnest point at the front
of the unit I'm gonna go ahead and open
it up here and then I want you guys to
check out the alright so I want you guys
to check it out
on the screen here yeah there we go so
that's the thickness of the led-backlit
13-inch screen actually I believe it's
13.3 inch okay and then there is the
bottom of the unit so there's that
thickness comparison so overall yes it
is very thin and very very light all
right you know we're gonna close it back
up for a second and so let's have a look
at what we've got in terms of i/o here
we've got a USB 2 port a headphone jack
and SD card slot so far all this is
looking pretty familiar along the back
we have a hinge excellent next we have a
DC in so there's your power we also have
an super speed USB 3 port so that is to
combat the Thunderbolt port on the
MacBook Air we also have I think it's
micro HDMI as well as our fancy-pants
little one that supports our to go oh no
hold on this is this so this does HDMI
and VGA so cool
so ok give me a sec here guys I got to
find out what this is got a little
confused there guys so this is the VGA
this is the micro HDMI and this is a
light ok so let's go ahead and up here
there's a little lip here which is gonna
help you lift up the lid
of the Zenbook look at how fancy-pants
this thing looks Wow okay so we have in
traditional PC fashion actual left and
right click buttons which will help you
left and right click in the software
that you use in your daily life
we also have check this out so a soos
actually got authorization to use
altered branding for Intel Core i7 as
well as Windows 7 in a monochrome kind
of style so that it wouldn't disrupt the
overall look of the machine we've gotten
sort of your typical isus branding here
stereo microphone by the look of things
which is pretty cool next to the webcam
and then the keyboard layout let's check
out the keyboard layout so the keyboard
layout looks very ideal from where I'm
sitting right now we've got long
backspace long inter long shift long
shift and a reasonably sized tab we've
also got a fairly ideal layout in terms
of the arrow keys as well as pretty much
everything else that I can see on here
you know what it's pretty darn similar
in fact to the MacBook Air okay here we
go so there there's both machines side
by side so the only major differences
look like the inclusion of a Windows key
on the Windows machine and yeah that's
looking like pretty much it in fact they
even both have their power keys here
although it looks like the a Suzanne
book has not come pre-charged
so I'm not going to be able to turn it
on just yet now I do want to take both
of these notebooks and I haven't really
done the finish on the top yet here so
this looks just outstanding it's kind of
a circular here you might need to move
to that side so that we can get the
light on it can you see the circular
pattern in it
yeah you can't okay good so you can see
kind of the well the circular pattern
with the Zeus branding in the top of the
notebook here and then on the bottom
very very sharp looking by the way kind
of like stainless steel appliances sort
of thing and then on the bottom instead
of a circle it's more like a brushed
pattern and then we've got little
plasticy rubbery feet on the bottom as
well as ventilation holes all along
that the unit can be opened up with Torx
screws all along the bottom if you
needed to well open it up for any reason
in particular so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the Isuzu Zenbook and
stay tuned to my NCIX plumb channel for
a more detailed a comparison of these
two notebooks head-to-head and thank you
for watching Linus tech tips don't
