volcano I see you guys followed in
videos review guide to a team sad to see
- tech tips benchmarking api's which is
close to its end of life what about our
X 480 Vulcan performance fine let's talk
about the new API is DirectX 12 and
Vulcan how they work how they perform
what they mean for the future everything
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free now what is an API or
application programming interface in
layman's terms it's a facilitator it
handles requests similarly to a waiter
at a restaurant taking orders you can
think of the customer as system a system
a wants to access some functionality or
information that system B which we'll
call the kitchen controls now system B
doesn't want to just let system a
directly access all of its information
there are security and liability issues
here but not only that having all these
different customers trying to talk to
the cook directly unless timed near
perfectly has the potential to be more
confusing than helpful enter the waiter
or in this analogy the API the waiter
can serve the customer with a menu of
subroutine definitions protocols and
tools that the customer can use to
achieve his task the customer then sends
that request through the waiter to the
kitchen where system B will act out
those instructions and then send a
response back to system a through the
API clean simple and delicious
theoretically this is how it works but
they can be more bloated and therefore
slow have you ever been to a restaurant
that has like four different menus one
for just all the different kinds of
freaking water with many pages
containing a multitude of items which
are essentially the same damn thing then
you can relate to the frustration of not
being able to find what you're looking
for at all do you ever just want to
throw the damn menus all in the air
stomp over the kitchen and scream can
you just render me a chicken burger and
some yam fries is that too much to ask
ok let's come back to that later first
what are they used for lots of things
api's can be used for web based systems
operating systems databases software
libraries or in this case computer
hardware but as important and ubiquitous
as they are they're not something the
average user will ever interface with so
why do we suddenly care so much about
DirectX 12 and
Elkin as selling points for games and
video cards well hype machine aside
DirectX 11 and OpenGL the predecessors
to the shiny new graphics api's are
rather bureaucratic like the complicated
menu analogy but worse because there are
even more degrees of abstraction there
are many systems and devices talking to
each other at a time passing
instructions around with many of them
being redundant or outdated it's just
not as efficient and there are other
problems for instance one of your
processor cores carries the burden of
managing the vast majority of all of the
critical time sensitive tasks one of the
main ways that the new graphics api's
are more efficient is that they can use
previously untapped hardware resources
multi-core CPUs are a great example here
look at this relatively realistic
hypothetical scenario given to us by AMD
thanks guys they show that OpenGL
stacked all of the work of presenting to
the user and processing the OpenGL
driver on to core 1 along with a large
portion of processing the OpenGL runtime
and the largest portion of game code
processing this leaves little for course
2 to 4 to work on almost nothing 4 5 &amp;amp; 6
to work on and literally nothing for 7 &amp;amp;
8 and for your reference DirectX 11
works in a very similar manner now let's
look at Vulcan though this is generally
applicable to both of the new generation
api's one of your processing cores is
still responsible for a bigger part of
the work than any of the others but
overall utilization is noticeably higher
even all the way down to core 8 now this
is a hypothetical example so I'm not
going to spend time analyzing the exact
improvements to the millisecond but in a
nutshell Vulcan the DirectX 12 do a much
better job overall of sharing the load
across all cores another key objective
is to shed old layers of unneeded
abstraction they've done this by
simplifying protocol routes minimizing
graphical driver overhead focusing
heavily on preventing time heavy draw
calls sent linearly to a single core of
the CPU instead of parallelizing draw
call packages in order to ease up on CPU
and let the GPU function as it should
kind of like multiple waiters attending
to the needs of each diner at a table
instead of having one waiter
with many plates on his arm dropping
them off one at a time another key is
that game developers can talk more
directly to the GPU Hardware this is
what is meant by the term lower-level
api think of it like having a manual
transmission in a car instead of an
automatic but to all the gear heads out
there watching this don't just assume
that all your DirectX 11 OpenGL games
are outdated junk at this point bear in
mind that poor operation of a manual
transmission can be worse than an
automatic or simply not better just
because a game has Vulcan or DirectX 12
support doesn't mean that efficiency and
performance automatically improve and
this is true especially for games that
were released with it early on though of
course there are a few exceptions for
the best results the new AP is need to
be part of the core design of not only
the game itself but the underlying
engine as well and you do the math it
can take easily two three or even more
years to make a good triple a title and
these api's haven't even been available
for that long
meaning the implementation of these
api's was likely added to tick a
marketing check box appease a longtime
partner or hopefully and very likely
just to gain the valuable experience
that you can only get by working
directly on them but when more true
DirectX 12 and Vulcan titles drop this
level of control for developers has the
potential to be awesome but a little
scary too because we're putting a lot of
responsibility on the game and more
specifically the game engine developers
and this is a major shift so I just
spent like four minutes telling you how
interesting and important the new AP
eyes are in reality the truly
interesting component of the equation is
going to be the new game engines that
arise because of the freedoms afforded
to them by the AP is not necessarily the
api's themselves and from game engine
creators who care the
John Carmack's and Tim Sweeney's of the
world you'll get amazing new features
unlocked by this additional performance
and flexibility but back to the scary
bit from before we're also putting this
greater degree of control and the
responsibility that comes with it in the
hands of gaming companies who tell us
things like 30 FPS is a good thing or
that implement game physics effects that
are reliant on the framerate that hasn't
been a thing since like Intel 46 and I
was arguable back then that's
inexcusable trash back to the API is
though since that's what we're really
here for so far we focus on similarities
but how do dx12 and Vulcan differ from
each other let's start with DirectX 12 a
big focus for Microsoft this time around
has been the introduction of their new
Lda and MDA modes for multiple graphics
cards for a rundown on how those work
check out this video on WTF is going on
with SLI along with this Microsoft's
vision to allow developers to support a
mixture of graphics card models and even
brands so the user can get as much power
as possible out of their available
hardware think of this more in terms of
using your onboard graphics to get a
little bit more oomph than a compelling
reason to build this monstrosity one of
the ways this could work is split frame
rendering or SFR this is when a portion
of the screen is rendered by one GPU and
the rest is rendered by a second but
we'll have to wait and see how well this
performs in the real world so that's
cool but being a Microsoft product
DirectX 12 will only function on Windows
10 and Xbox so Linux OSX Android
enthusiasts and actually even people who
are still in Windows 7 and Windows 8 are
left out in the cold which brings us to
Vulcan Vulcan brought to us by the
Khronos group is the primary successor
to OpenGL and is proudly cross-platform
working on everything we just mentioned
and more this is a huge deal for steam
OS in particular and Linux in general
because it should bring with it a
stronger support for a wider range of
titles something Linux has struggled
with ever since well ever so Vulcan is a
big deal
has been using it as an droids low-level
API since 2015 and Dan Ginsburg from
valve has talked about it on stage and
said that Vulcan is the future although
that's not surprising considering
directx12 doesn't work on steamos and
valve Microsoft relationship this has
been getting a little tense lately
moving on there was one last thing that
they had in common
asynchronous compute now this has been a
highly controversial subject making it
unfortunately
outside the scope of this video but if
you guys want to see a similar video
dedicated to it let me know in the
comments down below
in a nutshell though it allows
additional lightweight work to run in
parallel alongside the main graphics
thread so specific lighting technique or
post process anti-aliasing method like
TSS AAA
now this dynamic scheduling introduces
some challenges for Nvidia and AMD that
did not exist in a more static ecosystem
but that's for them to worry about and
for me to maybe cover in another video
that being said it does seem that AMD
has been pushing harder than Nvidia and
it shows performance wise as AMD is
currently seeing more of a benefit than
Nvidia in the 3d mark time spy benchmark
which allows you to switch asynchronous
on or off when reviewing the numbers for
these api's you'll notice that they're
kind of all over the place looking at
rise of the Tomb Raider a Direct X game
we can see that while it does make a
significant improvement at 1080p
once you step up a bit to 1440p or even
4k things seem to fall apart a little
bit and DirectX 11 actually pull the
head hit men on the other hand did not
share this funky scaling pattern and
seemed to improve when using DirectX 12
or at the very least stay the same
across all the graphics cards I tested
it with which should represent GP 104
with the GTX 1080 GP 106 with the gtx
1066 gigabyte edition for the nvidia
side and the power of AMD's new polaris
architecture with the RX 480
moving on to ashes of the singularity
this game is like half benchmark half
game so it shows the biggest improvement
by far
when using DirectX 12
instead of directing and for the Vulcan
fans out there I've heard there will be
a patch coming for you as well
one great additional piece of insight
that ashes displays at the end of their
benchmark is CPU frames versus GPU
frames what this essentially means is
how many frames your CPU could
potentially push compared to what your
GPU actually pushed so if the CPU number
is higher you could get more overall FPS
with a graphics card upgrade notice that
when we run the more CPU focused version
of the benchmark the numbers are at par
because now you're intentionally CPU
bottlenecked moving on to Vulcan Doom
numbers for the Nvidia side are just a
mess for the GTX ten eighty Vulcan was
similar to Tomb Raider worse at 4k than
opengl 4.5 dropping down to 1080p
however and it's a whole different story
with massive improvements shown the arcs
variety does show the performance trend
that we would expect improving
considerably when running the Vulcan API
and utilizing asynchronous compute
shaders good so the features sound
pretty great the performance depending
on your configuration is probably good
but it might not be great what about
supported games on the DirectX 12 side
of things the list seems rather
populated and there is a fair number of
titles on the way that are claiming they
will support it but this doesn't mean
that DirectX 12 integration hasn't been
riddled with issues quantum break was a
mess tomb Raider's back-end barely even
functioned for a while to the point
where they added a warning if you enable
it and the upcoming Deus Ex mankind
divided which I think is out now it was
supposed to launch with support for it
and that's been pulled for a while so
they can fix it up and Vulcan side of
things is rough too their support list
has four items on it one of which is
upcoming one of which is dota freaking 2
not sure about you but I sure needed
more FPS in dota on my DirectX 12
capable hardware another is the rather
wonderful single-player game from 2014
possibly not that many current players
unfortunately and then lastly we have
doom
a beautiful-looking game with proper
built-in support and asynchronous
compute capabilities cool but that's
singular so there you go
in conclusion the future is bright with
physics and AI heavy games being among
the most exciting things we have to look
forward to which is awesome but the
present is more a light at the end of
the tunnel situation get excited for new
game engines that support these api's
and be on the lookout for awesome new
game engine technology that will likely
arise from the improvements made here
this may finally signal the return of
our old cores for gaming episodes maybe
we'll finally have an episode that
doesn't end in four cores is the best
because by that time you're $1700 ten
core Extreme Edition will finally matter
maybe today we're highlighting the k7 xx
limited edition ruby-red headphones
of course from Mass drop they also have
a bunch of other cool things that you
can buy like with other people so that
the price goes down and if more people
buy it the price goes down further to a
logical minimum and it's it's really
cool we should check out mass drop
regardless the products were showcasing
today is the same spec wise as the k7 xx
headphones the lines reviewed and you
guys all liked some time last year you
can check that video out here or all
over my it's going to be the real
difference however is that this run uses
red accents on the ear cups and headband
remember that this is a limited drop so
if you want a pair you're going to have
to act relatively fast these headphones
were configured by mass drop and
manufactured by AKG just to note for
international orders if you're outside
of the US there's a $25 shipping and
handling fee put on top and that's it
check out mass drop thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked oh but if you
liked it you know what to do hit the
like button get subscribed do all that
kind of stuff check the link of video
description down below where you can buy
like GPUs or something I guess we talked
about those in this video also check out
the length of video description down
below to buy a shirt and go to the forum
to talk about everything I said in this
video there's might be something wrong
full
lay the crap out of me for that and then
I'll learn and that'll be good but oh
man
anyways watch this video which is about
wTF is going with us alive because we're
making a series of these now although
continuing to do these might kill me so
I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
