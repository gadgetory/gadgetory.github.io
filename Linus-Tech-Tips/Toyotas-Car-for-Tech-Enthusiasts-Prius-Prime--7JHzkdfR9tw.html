sponsored social posts or better yet
tuned into the awesome periscope stream
from the Prius Prime announcement at the
New York International Auto Show where I
ran around opening up hoods and honking
horns and stealing the touch-up paint
from the prototype Prime you guys know
how I do it really raises an interesting
question why did Toyo don't want to
partner with me again well thanks guys
and we're even doing it better this time
not only do I have my very own fully
functional Prius Prime to unbox one of
the first off the production line but
while in the interest of protecting
trade secrets they couldn't tell me
absolutely everything I've also got a
handful of interesting answers to my
questions about what really went into
this fascinating marriage of technology
and automotive engineering I got where
they always - sorry am i up now if
anyone's in line up so up oh let's go
have a look shall we so it starts on the
outside this is what car people do right
they admire the 15 inch slicked
aerodynamic covers over your dope 15
inch alloy rims isn't so hard you got
your aggressively angled headlights
lines stuff and this is really cool
there's like a robot man face styling to
the back but what you guys don't see it
here look you got your your sunglasses
right there you got your like mustache
and like a nose well we can agree to
disagree that's fine but what pretty
much everyone does agree on is that
Prius prime features noticeably sporty
or styling than previous Priuses why I
mean in the past Toyota was perfectly
content to build Priuses that look like
well Priuses so it turns out the answer
has to do with drag using a combination
of simulations run on their own
supercomputers did you know Toyota has
supercomputers I sure didn't but
apparently they kick ass because only a
single prototype needed to be built to
the air flow separation suppression
characteristics of the upper body
and the air flow rectifying effects of
the enlarged underfloor covers in a wind
tunnel to achieve Prime's 0.25 drag
coefficient only marginally higher than
a 787 airliner and there are lots of
other things that might seem like
premium or sporty or an enthusiast
design choices that really come right
back down to efficiency slick AF front
grille design nope right there flap to
control engine cooling and air
resistance LED lights these are four
cool factor right wrong LEDs are smaller
lighter and more power efficient than
traditional lights Toyota Safety sense P
features like their pre collision system
with pedestrian detection lane departure
alert with steering assist full speed
range dynamic radar cruise control
safety okay yes safety but also
efficiency in your car that doesn't go
anymore it's not efficient right carbon
fiber reinforced polymer trunk track day
right wrong weight reduction and
redistribution efficiency let's get
inside shall we
no one's gonna move the caramel on in
here right okay okay so this is the
point then I think I'm supposed to
mention the best-in-class 19.8 cubic
feet of cargo capacity
I mean I'm Canadian and it's cubic foot
anyway besides I'm more interested in
the how so they upgraded the battery
from 56 cells to 95 cells over the last
gen and to make room for it they moved
it down and forward this has the obvious
benefit of getting the weight closer to
the center of the vehicle and then they
actually adjusted the suspension in the
rear as well making it more vertical
let's move on in shall we
60/40 split engine mode oh you know it's
always funny to me when we do projects
like this because there's like a
committee on whether my clothes are
going to clash with the interior styling
of the car like that's the concern they
didn't get awkward right ah okay so
let's take a look around here most of
this is at least somewhat familiar we've
got the Qi wireless charging we've got
the colour heads-up display JBL green
edge speakers proximity sensors parking
assist backup camera so it's an 11 point
6 inch 1920 by 1080 full HD display
running an undisclosed operating system
that handles all of the things that you
would traditionally do through the
potato I'll shoot can we do that again
all the functionality that you would
normally get through the console nailed
it
it's also running an undisclosed
processor but I can speculate that it's
doing a heck of a lot more than just
smoothing out the animations on screen
because there is a lot going on in here
scheduled charging the ability to use
easy mode normal hybrid mode or a third
mode that dynamically switches between
them and their predicted efficient Drive
which sounds painfully marketing speaky
but actually does pretty much what it
sounds like
the car will learn up to a thousand
stops and will coach you on when to
release the accelerator so the
regenerative braking can kick in earlier
and work its magic even the climate
control system was custom tailored for
prime in cold weather down to minus ten
degrees Celsius which involved this
fancy battery heating element in order
to keep things working properly so that
means it's a cold day you hop in you can
run an easy mode immediately and
furthermore thanks to the heat pump
based HVAC system your range in cold
conditions is going to be improved over
systems that power the heating element
off of the battery directly so it's that
combined with everything else we've
looked at today that allows prime to
achieve its epa-estimated 133 MPGe
your mileage may vary full of
disclaimers taxes not included batteries
not included other charges maple okay no
batteries are included so I don't want
it I want to get any trouble saying
things that aren't true
which I guess leads us pretty much to
the end of this thanks to Toyota for
bringing us down here thanks to you guys
for watching if you want to learn more
about Prius prime you can check out the
link that we've got in the video
description that's Toyota comm / Prius
prime and I think that pretty much wraps
it up like this video subscribe all that
good stuff make sure that you like the
video I think I said that see you guys
