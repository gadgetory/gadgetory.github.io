the d-link DWA 182 this is pretty much
actually don't know of another one I
mean there's media bridges there's a not
a whole lot else but there are not a lot
of wireless AC clients out there yet and
d-link already has a USB one so very
very cool stuff so this is a dual band
AC 1200 next generation Wi-Fi remember
guys this number right here refers to
how many megabit per second it is
theoretically capable of delivering so
in theory this guy's capable of over a
gigabit in terms of raw throughput now
remember there's overhead involved so
you're not going to see that in the real
world plus you have distance and speed
drops and whatever else but that's what
it is theoretically maximum capable of
so there's the speed superior range dual
band so that means four point or 2.4
gigahertz and five gigahertz five
gigahertz remember is not quite as good
for range but is a little bit better for
speed and there's a lot less
interference on that frequency versus
2.4 gigahertz which everything from like
old Wireless cordless phones and all
kinds of other stuffs on their HD 3d
ready at that kind of speed it better be
easy setup okay so draft AC compliant
and compliant D compliant a compliance
so it's got lots of different backwards
compatibility WPS set up for easy
configuration this is basically all the
same stuff it just told us on the back
oh they have 24/7 support now I didn't
even know that and their packaging is
printed with sway ink
Windows 7 compatible hopefully Windows 8
compatible too
let's find out what's in here so we've
got a Quick Start sort of start here CD
we can download the latest off the
d-link website got something in like the
francais a written offer or whatever
source code thing okay I'm glad we put
that on a piece of paper ah dual band
okay package condom really we open up
the package and it tells us the package
oh well that's so that we can check and
make sure that everything's in there but
seriously there's your Quick Start Guide
and finally Wow look at this thing this
is this is a manly USB adapter important
install the software from the bundled CD
before inserting the adapter they did
put it on a big yellow sticker so I
guess I better make sure that I do that
although that won't help me the next
time when this is in the pile of like
network adapters and I don't see that
warning and then I forget and plug it in
without you know what I'm going to do
this is something I highly recommend you
guys do for yourself
just leave warning labels for yourself
on things there problem solved no you
know what let's just make it not look
stupid there we go so there's a WPS
adapter there's your indicator LED that
must be a new d-link logo because I've
never seen that before there's a more
traditional d-link logo on the back got
some information including the MAC
address and here we have all cardinal
sin committed caps that don't attach to
the back that's that's a shame USB to
interface meaning we'd be limited to 480
megabits per second anyway because
that's the limit of USB 2 so so if we
can get that kind of throughput then I
guess I'll be then I guess I'll be
pleased with it because that's more than
a G adapter can do anyhow it comes with
an extension cable so if you don't want
to plug it directly into something you
want to get it up sort of higher away
from something then that'll help and
it'll look something like that oh there
we go I think that pretty much covers it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the DW a1 a2 one of
the first AC adapters for this new
exciting standard don't forget to
