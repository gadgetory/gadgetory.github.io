if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience
welcome folks to my unboxing of the
Corsair air 540 this is part of their
Carbide series go ahead and open this
bad boy up and let's see what Corsair
has to say for themselves first and
foremost I would stand in cooling and
quieter operation I don't know about the
quieter operation because it's quite
messy but definitely outstanding cooling
more on that in a moment included AF 140
L fans lower striction fan covers and
dust filters ideal for advanced air
cooling with support for 280 or 240
millimeters in the top 280 or up to 360
millimetre front rads and built for
Brewers so that either means that it's
built for people who make their own beer
at home or it's built for fans of the
Milwaukee Brewers I'm not sure which of
those things is the case but what I
think we can be sure about is that if
any of those people happen to be PC
enthusiasts then this case was built for
them regardless of what baseball team
they follow alright so there goes the
box and whoa look at that the statics
making the hair on my arm stand up see
check that out that's why you should
discharge a case before you ow all that
got me really good ok before you can
build a system in it so it uses a closed
cell hard foam not my favorite as you
guys probably know but I understand why
manufacturers do it from a cost-saving
standpoint the good news about this case
is it does come in a nice double thick
corrugated box so hopefully we won't
have any trouble
I know Corsair has been pretty good
about their packaging in the past in
fact with their ax 1200 eye power supply
we threw it out of a moving car to
simulate what will likely happen to it
and shipping and it did not break so
there was that all right so now time for
the case itself we've got a manual which
I of course won't look at and then we've
got the air 540 I like cube cases but
not when they're over-the-top I thought
about getting a mountain mods case at
one point I ended up not doing it but
basically the point I'm trying to make
with all this is I like a belt then that
they're shorter
but I don't necessarily like about them
that the footprint is wider and that's
been the thing that has made me not get
them for time and time again when I've
considered them so the front of this
case has a very unique sort of layout to
it it has two vertically mounted five
and a quarter inch base it also has your
reset power harddrive indicator LED
microphone headphone and two USB 3.0
Jack's other than that is completely
clean on the right side and there's a
reason for that there's not really much
back there then here we've got up to a
two to one to 140 ml fans or three 120mm
fans behind a nice open grill with fan
filters as well as a nice little coarser
emblem kind of a soft no it's not soft
touch but it's a matte plastic finish
that actually looks quite sharp in
person and seems to be reasonably
fingerprint resistant which is
definitely a positive thing for a
computer case because even building in
one the first time there are ones that
you can stain to the point where you
can't even use them anymore well you
could use them but it would bother you
if you have obsessive-compulsive
disorder like me um self diagnosed I'm
not actually obsessive compulsive or
maybe I am either way I have to finish
this sentence in a way that will be
satisfying okay so we've got an air
intake right here next to oh what's that
that's where the power supply now that's
kind of funny and we can also look at
the case from the back because this
gives us a better idea of what's
actually going on inside so lots of
ventilation holes here here here and
here as well as our i/o and one two
three four five six seven eight PCI
slots so those will give us support for
ATX motherboards but not necessarily XL
ATX but we could if it's an XL ATX eight
slot board up here on the top we are
have support for to 120 or to 140
millimeter fans and then we also have
the ability am using these thumb screws
on the top there we go to pull this off
so go ahead take a step back mister
camera operator b-roll sir and we can
pull that off just like that so that
gives us a better look at the way that
the mounting mechanism works for those
fans and/or radiators that you want to
mount up there on the top and check this
out you can also pull off the front just
like that so that's where we get access
to our fan filters as well
as you can actually bolt this down if
you want so normally it's just secured
by the top piece but there's two spots
for thumb screws right here and right
here that will allow you to secure that
in transit or whatever else
now we also get access to our front
removable fan filter which I have no
idea how to actually remove but I'm sure
there's a way look at that that was easy
it's magnetic
very nice and it goes on low yeah that
gives us a closer view of what's going
on in there so there's those AF 140 L
fans those are the low-speed variant of
their AFM's
compared to the retail versions you do
not get the rubber isolating mounts as
well as the color rings that let you
change the look of them so they will
look just like that forever and ever and
ever we've got a nice big side panel
window and there's a good reason for
this because you can see pretty much all
of the important guts on the inside of
your system through this side panel it
is basically enough room in here for a
motherboard room that is all because the
motherboard goes here why don't I grab a
motherboard we'll make this simple on
ourselves why won't I get running boards
where they go just get one there you go
so the motherboard goes right there
which leaves you room for a couple of
drives down in the bottom so here I'm
going to point it those down here you
can see all the accessories are included
in this little box and one of the drive
cages so you can put either three and a
half or two and a half inch drives down
there using the included holes for two
and a half inch drives okay those are
over so those are hot spot check that
out so you can swap those in down there
no problem you also have room to install
lots of thick radiators here and thick
radiators here and then that is pretty
much it on the side look at all these
cable management holes though remember
these debuted with the 800 D and we are
still seeing the use for them today
because everything else needs to go on
the other side of the case which means
it needs a way to get over to the
motherboard so let's move over to the
other side
I'm just going to pull off two more
thumb screws here which are all we need
to do the whole case is coming apart
without any tools a lot of the time even
cases with thumb screw screws need a
screwdriver to take them apart because
they factory tighten them too tight and
I can't get them apart on my own so
we've got tooless two and a half inch
drive mounts here well that's kind of
clever
the clip to go I didn't even know that
about these go ahead and look at you can
pop on or off as many as you want in
fact that would allow you to mount them
and then install them so there there's a
stack of four of them and then the way
that they clip into place is just in
here so you can they have a tension
mount at the back see right there that
will pop them out as soon as you move
this away and allow you to easily
install and uninstall two and a half
inch drives that's kind of cool as well
as your two five and a quarter inch bays
right here and then that is pretty much
it for drive installation options so you
get the two three and a half inch
hot-swap ones with the included black
cables right here so you run these to
your power supply which happens to be
located like right here for very very
short cable runs there we go so power
supply goes here you run these to the
front of your motherboard through here
and then that's it
for two and a half to three and a half
but you've got a lot of empty space up
here that you could probably sort of mod
something maybe you put your pump up
here or you'd like your reservoir or
whatever else but you little rez down
here all the included cables are black
not quite down to the individual wire so
you can see the HD audio cable right
there has a little bit of color to it
but yeah you can have a closer look at
that if you want but honestly it's not
that bad there's the included USB free
wire here's the tool is five and a
quarter inch Bay mounting and I think
that pretty much covers it so what does
it come down to with this guy if you
already know that you need an air 540
then you already know you need an air
540 it does cool better there is a
direct path for airflow right from these
fans to the graphics cards which are
going to be sitting like right here
where my hand is that here I'm going to
show you I'm gonna grab a brackets part
two that my friends is where your
graphics card will be right next to the
fans in fact longer graphics cards will
be even closer to the fans right there
so if you want the best possible cooling
and you want to get all that stuff all
those drive cages all that random junk
out of the way of your cooling this will
work for you if you want something
that's super compact and has a smaller
footprint then maybe it won't thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the air 540 carbide series case
from Corsair leave me a comment tell me
if you prefer a narrower foot
or if you prefer something that has more
of a more of a cubish sort of shape to
it if there's a practical reason for
doing so and as always guys don't forget
