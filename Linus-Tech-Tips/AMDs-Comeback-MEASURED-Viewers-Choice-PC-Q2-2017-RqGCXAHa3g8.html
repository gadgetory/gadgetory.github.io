of AMD's rise in seven CPUs and the
results are in
it's time for us to pull back the
curtain on just what our audience
members bought this last quarter so come
away with me as we use 46 thousand lines
of Amazon affiliate transactions to spot
consumer trends spy on your sex toy
purchases and yes build up a
hypothetical PC using the most popular
parts off to Big Data lad
the phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with genuine Cherry MX switches
and a new white backlit variant check it
out at the link below
so did AMD dethrone the champ no not
even close so the core i7 7700 K is the
best-selling chip for the third time in
a row but all of that crying I did in
the last video available here seems to
have actually had in effect the better
value gaming chip the core i5 7600 case
has edged its way to the number two slot
I mean it's a distant second but I still
feel better about myself but what about
portion well let me put it this way out
of the top 10 best-selling CPUs from our
list 4 of them are rising with the 1700
and 1700 X performing just about equally
in fourth and fifth place respectively
this brings AMD from just seven percent
market share in episode two all the way
to twenty nine percent among our viewers
so I think it's fair to say then that
competition has returned to the PC space
the question now then is how much should
we expect that slice of the pie to grow
as AMD launches more products like the
value-oriented rising 3 and as
developers start to optimize their games
to get better performance out of this
new competing architecture place your
vet in the comments below
cooler masters three-time champ the
hyper 212 Evo blew away the competition
yet again with triple the sales of the
runner-up the other two spots on the
podium are occupied by the usual
suspects as well in third is the hyper
t2 which is basically a budget version
of the 212 Evo and climbing to second is
the corsair hydro series h 100 i
all-in-one liquid cooler
by this change well I am attributing it
to some bank account recovery since the
Christmas drain and rise in X processors
that need beefy cooling and don't come
with coolers Corsair continues to
dominate ram sales of the 149 different
SKUs that were sold 23% of all sales
come from the top three best-selling
ones with 32 hundred megahertz dims
in either black or white taking the cake
build it and they will come
AMD rise incompatible a.m. for
motherboards are here and they're even
closer to the top of the list then the
chips that fit in them somehow
in second place is the asus prime x 370
pro 4 AMD's platform of support for both
overclocking and dual GPU gaming
configurations and in first place well
last episodes winning board reigned
supreme once more this affordable asus
be 150 LGA 1151 board isn't capable of
overclocking all of those 7700 keys you
people are buying but at least it's
cheap and it's got an MDOT 2 slot so go
for it I guess there was a huge upset in
the graphics department where the best
selling card by just one point was the
Asus GTX 1080 Strix this was actually
the best-selling 1080 last time around -
but that was only good enough for fourth
place overall this big jump in 1080
sales seems to be due to the $100 price
drop that they got after the release of
the 1080 Ti in March so we're expecting
even more changes in this segment once
the GT 1030 drop no I'm just kidding
it's the upcoming AMD Vega cards that
we're expecting to shuffle the deck
somewhat one more thing have you guys
noticed how many graphics cards have VR
in the name these days well we have its
20% with MSI Asus and ZOTAC being me I'm
going to say it
worst offenders here let's see if this
trend like putting gaming in the name of
everything picks up in future episodes
in the last episode the 250 gig Samsung
850 Evo overtook the 500 gig variant of
the same drive as our best-selling SSD
well guess what the 500 gig Evo is back
we just can't quite figure out why if
you think it's because of a price drop
you'd be wrong on average people
actually paid $17 more for it this time
around here's just so much gosh-darn
mystery in the world isn't there
something that makes a bit more sense
though is sales of MDOT - SSDs these are
on the rise with the most popular MDOT -
Drive arriving in fourth place with a
$75 price premium over the 850 Evo of
the same capacity on the hard drive
front the one terabyte Western Digital
blue is still king but we're going to be
keeping our eyes peeled for higher
capacity hard drives becoming more
popular now that Intel octane module
sales have started to hit the books
because those things can accelerate a
hard drive in a big way for operating
systems Windows 10 home USB drives have
officially and decisively claimed the
number one spot we don't even have to
count the one person who bought the
Spanish version and later returned it
the USB cost the same amount as
downloadable Windows but has the more
flexible license terms of the retail
copy EVGA continues to supply the most
popular power supplies but just because
the 500 watt bronze one again doesn't
mean that the technology isn't moving
forward overall while the price of this
PSU has stayed near the rock bottom
forty two dollars the price of the EVGA
650 watt fully modular 80 plus gold has
actually dropped around 30 bucks since
episode two making it a more attractive
option for cases the best-selling single
SKU was the corsair crystal series 570 x
RGB that we featured in our when
showpiece the upgrade video and in our
editing den up
but that's not quite the whole story if
you count all the color variations then
the best-selling case was actually the
fan tax and suit evolve tempered glass
edition naturally more budget-conscious
shoppers went for the NZXT s340 while
those interested in smaller form factor
cases chose Silverstone's ml o 8 this
time around Noctua iced the competition
with the NFF 12 coming in on top even
though they cost twice as much as course
there's popular air series fans and they
only come in one distinct let's just put
it that way color scheme so we'd like to
ask the audience do you think it would
be better for not to us in the long term
to maintain their strong brand identity
or to offer more modern flavors maybe
even RGB blasphemy sorry I got carried
away okay moving on now we've been
monitoring the situation and high
refresh rate 1080p displays one once
more this time it's a 24 inch or from a
soos and the march towards the
mainstream doesn't look like it's
slowing down with high refresh rate
gaining way more market share than any
other key feature over the last quarter
now really oh okay well you're not going
to believe this one but take last
episode's best-selling mouse and
multiply it sales by five that's how
many of these damn things you guys
bought it's the red dragon central
forest mouse from our cheap gaming mouse
roundup and guess what second and third
place are from that video too but wait
it gets even better you guys also bought
the keyboard to go with it the red
dragon K 503 harp the seven color
backlit gaming keyboard I guess you guys
really love these cheap crap roundups
hey because it gives you so much more
money to spend on the ever-popular hype
Rex cloud 2 gaming headset they must
sell so freakin many of those things so
then putting it all together we once
again for the third time running have a
compatible computer it's got five of the
same parts of last time but while
similar but cheaper was the trend in the
last episode of viewers Choice beers
choice PC number three is a hundred and
seventy-five dollars more expensive than
even the first viewers choice PC with
the price jumps coming mostly from
moving upmarket with the graphics card
case and SSD Skillshare is an online
