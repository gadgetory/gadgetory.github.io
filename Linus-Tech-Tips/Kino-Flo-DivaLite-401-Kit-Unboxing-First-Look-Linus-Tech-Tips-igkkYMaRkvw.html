what is apparently sort of some kind of
voodoo magic when it comes to when it
comes to consistent lighting that we can
use in the studio and carry around with
us so this is the Kino Flo diva light
get 401 which comes in an awesome
carrying case so I can already see that
so we're gonna go ahead and wow this is
cool you should come check this out you
can't even move Kenya there's stuff all
over the floor camera man can hardly see
what he's doing and where he's going so
comes in like I'm oh I was gonna say
briefcase but if your briefcase looks
like this you're doing it wrong swirling
luggage so we've actually got two of
these there's another one right over
there and I'm only gonna unbox one of
them for now but this is to go along
with all of the new - tech tips gear
including our fs700 camera or new tripod
it's all kind of there there's an HDMI
cable that's sort of special as well and
all it comes with the skin oh I failed I
actually bought stands for these but
they come with them so I don't know give
me that look like you know what woody
woody doing over there what are you
doing and I don't have a good answer
from so here's the stand that comes with
the kit I should have known something
that's like a kit from my phone with a
stand but I did not I did not realize
that so there we go that goes down there
the whole thing goes kind of down to the
bottom and then you can
there we go that's more like what we're
trying to do here I don't know what
we're trying to do here there we go so
this needs to go at the bottoms and then
this we want to turn nice and white so
that it go anywhere okay so I don't know
how I do stand the other ones I got are
like 9 feet or something like that so
let's find out how it's all there okay
so these Kino Flo is use banks of banks
are very consistent lighting in order to
get lighting effects that are as well
very consistent and very even and they
don't change in color temperature over
time like like the more traditional
incandescent Stu you can easily put gels
over them in order to change the quality
of the color ah look at that it comes
with a carrying case that is suitable
for here we go I'm just gonna reach over
here suitable for the Kino Flo True
Match lights that you also need to go
with them so I got either those 55 watt
bulbs and you can probably just put the
whole package in here no you can't
really they want you to open the package
well fortunately we're good at that on
this channel although I'm a little bit
worried I don't want to touch them or
anything I don't know if these are the
kinds of bulbs that you're not allowed
to touch oh that's okay they have
plastic pieces on the ends don't we deal
all right so these can go in here or
they will be safe and they can be
transported that way
awesome so you can start up to 1 2 3 4 5
6 in this little carrying case that's
made of late
corrugated plastic so it'll be quite a
bit more durable than if they gave you a
cardboard one so we'll go ahead and put
that back in there okay here's some kind
of adapter whoo ha okay this is likely
something to do with it ah yes so this
is for mounting at different angles and
it comes in a really they put it in a
ziplock bag and then they tape over the
Ziploc so it's like okay thank you I
suppose
it's quite difficult to open there we go
okay so this looks like it's for
changing the angle so you can put this
on the top and then you can kind of have
it sort of like that that's my guess
anyway I'm just guessing right now it's
very robust feeling though
okay let's go ahead and put that back in
there so our true match light you can
put away for now operation manual
here is the light housing itself so for
the value price of only it's a two foot
four bank full it's in here okay so
here's a diffuser comes with that so for
the value price of only like fifteen
hundred dollars you can get yourself
makino float evil night and that doesn't
seem like a good idea to you then you
also don't have to you know I'm not
pressuring you or anything I thought
what this channel is about pressuring
people to buy things but I'm definitely
excited to see what kind of results we
can achieve with these
these new lighting kits and all that
heavy actually I mean it's not light but
well it is a light but it's not like
alright so punches built-in both in
shutters which are on
oh that's tiny they're just on like
tensioned like metal pieces here so
they're quite flexible so you can play
around with where you want them to go
it's got it's a little bit directional
but you can get an adapter that will
make it more directional if you should
so desire this piece comes off quite
easily with filter so you just remove
all the velcro sand you can do that to
install lights or take it off or do
whatever it is you want to do I'm
guessing this evens things out a little
bit it takes four bulbs total so once
you turn off power to change lamps do
not create fixture on the back yes we
don't want to basically don't want to
open up and need the internal power
supply stuff that's going on in here and
then this piece can yeah there we go so
that's a ball and socket piece right
there so you can tighten that up once
you've got it positioned exactly where
you want it and then this can mount onto
probably this piece here to achieve a
straight up mouch things actually quite
heavy I'm making this look easy because
I'm so puffed but I'm not making it look
easy at all Emily okay well whatever
this would go in there and it would
secure if I can get it open wide enough
give me a second
alright so we installed four banks of
lights but which is a total of eight
tubes here and then this is this is the
gel holder so this piece is just you
know it's actually cameraman and I were
both noticing that it's it's kind of
ghetto actually the whole construction
of it like it's made of like corrugated
plastic or like just piece of like
laser-cut you know metal and like velcro
straps for things I guess it's expensive
because it's a specialized piece of
equipment but I still would have would
have liked to see sort of the you know
the craftsmanship that goes into
a little bit more impressive winders oh
yeah I want to show you the side of the
unit really quick first before I turn it
on here so I've got it attached to the
stand that came with we didn't end up
needing this for anything so I guess
this one would allow you to have a
little bit more flexibility in terms of
what you're doing but we'll be using it
in a studio environment for a - tech
tips so there you go
comes with a built-in dimmer so I'm
gonna leave it at the dimmest to start
if there's also a remote dimmer as well
but you won't be using that at the start
you can tie over here is selectable so
you can change you can either fire up
two lamps at a time or four lamps at a
time the switch right there there's also
what appears to be some kind of a fuse
or switch for 120 volt versus 230 volt
operation so let's start with two lamps
and full dimness just so that we don't
sort of break anything and diesel
informs me that I'm supposed to say
striking before I turn on the light so
striking okay that's not doing a little
lot so let's go ahead and change to
change to four labs here there we go
you also don't have to deal with the
warmup times that are typical of oh
really now you probably have to Java
know whatever the lighting is supposed
to be consistent with this thing
does it look very bright my hand is more
late I suppose let's turn up okay we're
about halfway
hey what about three-quarters do it
there we go so now we have what is
apparently very natural very Sun lady
looking studio lighting so you got a lot
to tell me here hold on I just
reposition this a little bit yeah did I
look I look beautiful to you does this
work are we good my shirt look mcgarrick
the coop do that you know J Lo's
directionality so we have two of them
we'll probably need more at some point
but you know Frank too is hopefully
enough thanks for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the Kino Flo
