asus rog g 703 and this thing it's
pretty freakin sick like we were able to
achieve 5 gigahertz overclocking all six
cores concurrently but can you really
call it a laptop when it doesn't fit on
your lap and should we be making the
sacrifices required to have a clamshell
design for a machine like this when
quite literally everyone is going to be
using it on a desk
well Asus thought not and over here at
our early preview of CES 2019 here in
our studio because Asus brought the show
to us is the rog mothership a complete
rethinking of the desktop rapoo it's
still heavy though the desktop
replacement category
private Internet access I mean that's
basically it that's exactly what you get
with PIAA and it's got loads of other
features as well check it out at the
link below okay so I guess step one is
to kind of open the thing oh I've been
informed there are tabs on the bottom
don't don't no I don't want the answer
don't wait oh that's weird so here's all
these vents on the bottom here with some
very hefty looking dents copper fit Wow
all the copper everywhere look at this
freakin stuff and this ventilated
perforated bottom here and I was
expecting that this thick side was gonna
contain the laptop and then this thin
side was going to contain the screen
that's like sort of the way that laptops
have sort of traditionally where blow
it's that no that's that is in fact the
keyboard so quiet that so this piece
comes down here and then this is what
speaker grilles intakes what is this
speakers hell yeah oh my god it's a
surface for gamers how about that
so instead of having the cooling of the
CPU the GPU the SSDs and all that stuff
choke down against the desk or your lap
or whatever the case may be they put
them all up here and the results well
they claim they are pretty darn
impressive my allowed to turn this thing
on I can turn it on okay oh my god it
came apart you can use it as an AI oh
and you can just ditch the keyboard and
like or you can just use the keyboard as
more like a traditional keyboard and
it's raised so check this shiz out you
can either just kind of adjust it for a
different organ on mcfeely you got your
trackpad on the right you got your
keyboard on the left and then
run a type-c wire over to your your
actual like a i/o computer with a screen
that folds on to the front of it I don't
know what to even call this thing
anymore or you can just flip over to
wireless mode here bebop and you can
like use it from the couch and you can
have that hooked up to your TV or
whatever the case may be and then it's a
pretty common use case actually for a
laptop I will find the power button at
some point this must be it
okay this is a prototype it's not
working a hundred percent here just
gonna plug in this mouse having a little
go freak out okay I'm not saying I broke
it I'm just saying it's broken and I'm
the last person who touched it that's
all where was I
so the original concept here actually
came from basically like going like this
with a G 703 and then measuring how much
better the temperatures of all those
heat generated components are once
you're not restricting the airflow by
having them sitting up against something
so in actuality this new device even if
it did have the same hardware wouldn't
necessarily run any cooler because
they've gone and they've made it thinner
to eat up that extra sort of thermal
budget that they made for themselves
which isn't to say this gimped on the
components because what's in here
requires some pretty hardcore cooling so
it's rocking a 6 core core I 989 50 H K
and r-tx 2080 that they won't let me
look at at all like not even in task
manager they've actually gone and
disabled it in the BIOS though given
that we do know the model number and
that is an RT X 2080 we're expecting
full-blown desktop performance but
computing isn't the only way that the
rog mothership that's what they're
actually calling this thing is insanely
fast so this will be their first mobile
machine with greater than
one gigabit networking it's actually two
and a half G which might feel kind of
strange given that we went from 10 to
100 to 1,000 to 10,000 but then now also
there's these weird Inbetweeners but
that's still a really nice bump that's
about 250 megabytes per second
real-world to a server that is enabled
for it so I mean it's not like you're
gonna have to do that necessarily
because it's got three nvme SSDs in raid
0 that also get additional cooling by
the way due to the upright nature of the
device so these are so fast basis
couldn't put all of them running off of
the chipset so two of them are directly
connected to the CPU for a wild eight
point seven gigabytes per second of data
transfer speeds I mean just like you
know it's not the most impressive demo
but you know just like booting up like
launching it you will definitely feel
the difference it's faster than I can
say
shave and Freud I don't even know if
that means what did I just say cuz I
said like German joke I don't get got it
the only problem though with the display
is that when you have all of these
components right up against the back of
it all that heat can be a very bad time
so to solve this problem no wonder this
thing is so heavy they created this CNC
machined heat shield so this right here
is what actually separates the display
and all of the heat generating
components and guess what this takes 20
hours to machine not to mention it costs
a freaking lot of money but I guess you
know the monkey was just out of the bag
and the engineers went hog-wild with the
robots because actually pretty much
everything about it this CNC machine out
of solid freaking blocks of aluminum so
this here is the
back panel with the kickstand there
where's the kickstand the kickstand ah
yes I believe this is the kickstand
beautiful needless to say everything
here there's a cost to CNC okay both in
terms of materials in time but there's a
benefit even without the actual laptop
in it this thing is incredibly stiff
like this is as much flex as I'd expect
from a finished device and it's just a
backplate so that's pretty much all we
can say about it for now
other than a quick look at IO you got to
power inputs so that should give you
some idea how power hungry it's gonna be
you got your VR port here SD and the
HDMI all that good stuff other than to
guess Thunderbolt 3 nice that this thing
is going to be extremely expensive so
let me know you guys want to see a full
review this thing yeah you want to see a

believe I missed this part look at this
they've got the cooling solution here
it's like it's massive its massive
