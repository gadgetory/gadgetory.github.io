focused a or a sub-brand back in 2014
the company has expanded the product
line from laptops and peripherals to
motherboards and video cards and now
finally to what is apparently the
world's first tactical monitor whatever
that means the product page is actually
ADA fascinating specimen the bezels are
portrayed as unrealistically thin
there's a couple of I think somewhat
misleading statements and then there's
this what is active noise-cancelling in
a monitor are you kidding me
well as it turns out they're not and
we're gonna find out exactly what that
means after this message from our
sponsor glass wire with glass wire you
can instantly see your current and past
network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code linus to
get 25% off glass wire at the link below
i'ma be upfront with you the active
noise-cancelling feature is the reason
that this monitor made it to our studio
it just it just raised so many questions
for you when it hit my inbox so we're
gonna start with what's up with that the
monitor has three microphones on the
front that actually listen to the
ambient noise in your room so then my
first thought was maybe it would use
them to try to add ENC to whatever
headphones you happen to be wearing if
they were plugged into the audio pass
through port but no it's actually kind
of the opposite the anc isn't there to
help you hear content better it's meant
to help others hear you better so what
you do is you plug your microphone into
the monitors three-and-a-half millimeter
jack no dice if you use a USB mic by the
way oops and then you use a horse's
sidekick software to specify what kind
of mic setup you have and how much noise
canceling you want to apply so then does
it work actually yes the monitor was
able to cut out our offices HVAC noise
and it actually sounds pretty good with
my HyperX cloud twos but other mics I
tried had a significant trade-off to
voice quality regardless of whether we
set it to very low or very high so
whether you'll end up using this feature
probably depends on your mic and your
room but I'm guessing a lot of people
especially the ones that watched our
budget Mike round up a little while back
are gonna end up leaving it off that
doesn't mean this review is over though
because as it turns out the noise
cancelling is only one of several gamer
focused features that are actually
pretty cool mostly like the sidekick
software itself which provided you have
the monitor connected via USB gives you
access to all the options that you'd
normally find in the on-screen display
except way less cumbersome so yes the
monitor still has the joystick nipple
which still is a lot easier than
discrete buttons on the back with no
labels but if you're watching this
channel I probably don't have to explain
to you guys why a keyboard
is just plain better than anything else
and there's also added functionality
like being able to bind just about any
setting to a hotkey it's super cool and
something that I hope gains mainstream
adoption even if there is a slight input
delay this is also where you find the
rest of the gaming features like another
one that's done right the on-screen
reticle now you might think that using
one of these counts as cheating and
you'd be correct but hey at least if
it's built into your monitor you can get
away with it and what sets the 8027 QD
apart is that unlike other monitors with
this feature the stock crosshairs are
visible without being distracting or
blocking your view plus if you're not
happy with it you can actually draw your
own completely custom one and go ahead
and put that on there so it could even
just be a tiny little dot if that's what
you're into next we've got a couple of
more maybe features so there's screen
overlays for vital stats that you can
customize the displays refresh rate and
timers and counters that you can bind to
hotkeys and then use for things like
tracking an opponent's attack cooldown
in a MOBA or reminding you to Scout in
an RTS or counting your headshots and an
FPS or I mean a million other ad hoc
things a gamer could do but that I
suspect few would do maybe I'm wrong hit
me up in the comments and then there's
the aim stabilizer which appears to be
yours his name for motion blur reduction
now the marketing claims that it removes
in game motion blur like from weapon
recoil to help you see better but in
practice it appears to be simply the
same backlight strobing that's been
present on gaming monitors for years now
and like those features it effectively
reduces smearing but it also reduces
maximum brightness introduces some
strobing crosstalk and it can't be on at
the same time as free sync then finally
there's some features that are just bad
like super resolution which is just
gross sharpening and black equalizer
which claims to increase visibility
in dark areas without over exposing the
bright areas but appears to be the usual
crank the gamma approach to this
function one that we wouldn't recommend
let's get back to free sync though
because all these tactical gaming
features aside this is actually just
straight up a solid monitor in its own
right
it's 2560 by 1440 144 Hertz and it's got
a free sync range of 48 to a hundred and
forty-four Hertz with low framerate
compensation which you can actually see
it work right here so the frame rate is
below the free sync range which means
that our low framerate compensation
inserts duplicate frames and the panel
refreshes at double the FPS this does
improve the perceived smoothness oh and
by the way yes that is the Nvidia
pendulum test thank you for asking
because even though this monitor is not
at the time of writing on invidious new
white list of free sync monitors that
are g-sync certified a quick update of
our Nvidia 10 series graphics card
drivers to version 4 17.1 7 does allow
us to turn it on and it appears to be
working pretty well another pleasant
surprise is actually the color accuracy
now this monitor isn't designed for
professionals that do color critical
work it's still an 8 bit panel plus frc
nor is it a top-of-the-line HDR monitor
with full array local dimming but it
does have vasa display HDR 400
certification so it is technically an
HDR monitor even if the peak brightness
is just 400 nits and perhaps more
importantly it has excellent coverage of
the DCI p3 color space with Wow like
really Wow
color accuracy that's just about as
close as the human eye can discern
so that is a total bonus for something
that's being billed as a gaming monitor
as for the industrial design it's got a
sharp kind of aggressive look with a
matte black anodized finish The Stand
assembles with just one screw and is
very robust articulating on all four
axes and we even saved the best for last
it's got RGB panels on the back that you
can configure individually I mean so
what if the user can't see them in most
people put their monitor against a wall
they're gonna know they're there in
conclusion then for $600 Horace's first
foray into monitors delivers performance
commensurate with other offerings in
this price range and with a handful of
extras for gamers that push me into yes
territory we recommend this monitor even
if the product page did lie about the
thinness of the bezels though we are not
endorsing that behavior it's gross we've
all got our everyday grooming routines

course shaving at least we should and no
