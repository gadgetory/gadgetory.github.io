got the WD my passport edge portable
hard drive this is a USB 3 or USB 2
which is basically the same thing well
the same physical connector the USB 3 is
about 10 times faster so I shouldn't say
it's the same thing it's ultra slim has
pad backup and it has password
encryption well-liked encryption that
you can open with a password rather not
password encryption password encryption
this new concept of encryption that
involves nothing but passwords no
cryptic encryption is like much more
complicated than just like a password
because I think it was just a password
then like you could just take the drive
out put into something else and then
read all the data off it WD has thought
of that and they don't want that to
happen to you or me found why they care
at all what I could not draw electro
links electronics like don't worry will
actually look at the hard drive now ok
take this out there we go let's have a
look at what WDS to say for themselves
this is a 500 gig drive however the
other capacities will look pretty much
the same automatic back where software
back where backup software is included
whenever you add your change of file
it's instantly backed up very cool
w security helps protect your files with
hardware encryption and password
protection to keep your data private now
some of you might think oh no it's ok
you know I know my data if I've got
nothing to hide then you know it's no
big deal but personally I would argue
that everything is private even though
we upload our entire lives to Facebook
if you didn't upload it to Facebook it's
probably for a reason so you might as
well use something encrypted the
contents are the smart wear software the
quick install guide and the things that
you see here yeah there we go
aha that's slim look at that it's
basically like like the actual plastic
shell on this must not be thicker than
like this because there's basically just
like a hard drive in there with four old
loser rubber to look at that they put
the XE little touches like that they put
the extra money into doing instead of
just molding a plastic bump onto it
which actually doesn't do anything
because it would just slide around on
the table like this which for hard
drives by the
is bad the rubber dots actually keep it
from you know moving unnecessarily which
is good okay there's your USB 3
interface on the back which goes a
little something like this and then like
this remember this plug is compatible
with USB 2 on us because we never hold a
hard drive like this by the way that's
sort of terrible there yeah I'm like
football safe encrypted ok in the back
of the connector there's additional pins
and then on the front of the connector
there's the USB 2.0 pins so that's how
that works
the software is presumably available for
download Allah did say it did say
package contents smart where thought you
know what is probably loaded on the
drive actually herder
there's your hair oh man I love this My
Passport edge this is a Quick Start
Guide plug the thing into the thing run
the thing and then get updates awesome
download the latest software Thank You
WD for validating what I've been saying
for years don't forget to subscribe for
more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I hope you've
enjoyed my unboxing of the My Passport
edge from Western Digital wait let's see
how long we can keep something from
turning off the camera
on my neck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
