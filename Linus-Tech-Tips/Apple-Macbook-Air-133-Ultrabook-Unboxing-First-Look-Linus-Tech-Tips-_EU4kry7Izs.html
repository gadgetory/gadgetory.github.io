I said I'm unboxing the MacBook Air
clearly that was a lie this is the Asus
Zenbook 13.3 inch all tried now I'm just
kidding I actually am unboxing the
MacBook Air but before you hit the
dislike button it's for a very good
reason it's so that I can compare it
against the Asus Zenbook so the MacBook
Air yes it's been out for a little while
this is the second-generation product
let's have a look at the overall spec of
the machine that I have here in the lab
today this is you know what it's not
going to be quite a fair comparison
between the MacBook Air and the Isuzu
Zenbook because in terms of the overall
spec the MacBook Air is actually not
quite up to snuff it is a core i5 versus
a core i7 processor on the Zenbook it
has they both have 256 gig SSDs they are
both similar in terms of the size in
terms of a form factor the amount of RAM
but the MacBook Air has Thunderbolt
which the Zenbook does not and what was
the other thing that was sort of missing
that I felt was not quite as good about
the MacBook Air yeah I think that was
pretty much it so basically um yeah it's
going only a core i5 instead of a core
i7 and yeah has a built-in FaceTime
camera which I think what they mean to
say is webcam and then software called
FaceTime pre-loaded on the machine but
you know I'm just a nit picking right ok
so hello inside the MacBook Air we find
a typical Apple documentation very
simple very slick very beautiful they're
so good at this congratulations you and
your MacBook Air were made for each
other I really hope I wasn't made for a
MacBook Air because I think that's
really you know selling myself short a
little bit here you can click anywhere
you can pinch to zoom you can rotate
images you can scroll up or down switch
between full screen apps using three
fingers and you Mission Control using
three fingers up so yes you have a
multi-touch touchpad
with gestures and all kinds of good
stuff like that excellent so here's
ready set up go and life with your
MacBook Air and problem meets solution
neat okay well you know what let's just
put that aside for now what else we got
here we got your Apple one-year limited
warranty that's another thing that's not
going to be quite as good about the
MacBook Air is the warranty is not as
long of a period compared to the Asus
notebook all right
I believe the battery is ninety days but
go ahead and correct me if I'm wrong on
this one here guys it's a one year on
the product itself and then 90 days on
the battery I really wish I could find
it this is taking so long
yes no yes I think so okay whatever
alright what else we got here um this is
another thing Apple is so good at and
that is creating power bricks that don't
suck along a little bit confused by this
oh cool okay so you can either see I'd I
really don't know Apple products that
well so I apologize there guys so check
this out you can do this one of two ways
so you can plug the wall wart directly
into the wall which would be not ugly
very elegant very nice and then you plug
in your little magnetic connector to
your MacBook Air which is also very
elegant very beautiful or you can go
ahead pop this baby out throw this in
here and you can plug it into low you
have a nice long cord now more
reminiscent of a of a PC style cord but
we're going to go with more the more
elegant solutions since that's clearly
what today is all about are doing a
macbook air unboxing so part of the
unboxing process is the removal of the
plastic so let's go ahead and unpeel
this bad boy so here we see apple's
trademark gorgeous aluminum finish and
really not enough can be said about it
if you've seen an apple you pretty much
know what i'm talking about so you got
that beautiful anodized aluminum
aluminum remember is lighter than most
metals but still retains the necessary
strength for use as
building material in consumer
electronics magnesium is another option
in fact that's been done in the past I
think Toshiba did it maybe it was
Panasonic one of them has done it with
with a thin and light style notebook but
the problem with magnesium it is highly
flammable so aluminum does not have that
particular drawback here we have a blue
piece paper protecting the 13.3 inch
screen and you know what let's do let's
do overall form factor a little bit
things that Apple does right well
everyone loves the chiclet keyboard
personally I don't but everyone else
seems to love the chiclet keyboards I
like a little bit more tactile feedback
but I am NOT the mass-market
they do their layout right though so
their Delete key is wide their shift is
wide their return is wide their other
shift is why their tab is wide
everything is wide they have properly
laid out arrow keys and the overall
keyboard feel and spacing is excellent
that is why people buy these machines
another thing Apple has figured out no
one else seems to be able to is huge
touch pads that are somewhat
proportional to the size of the screen
in terms of their shape so we've got a
nice wide screen large size multi-touch
touchpad that is going to make your user
experience better we've also got our Web
MD popstar Facebook FaceTime FaceTime
camera up here and let's go ahead and
check out the overall thinness oh yeah
oh this is going to be even better than
usual I'm going to do my iPhone
thickness comparison so there's my
thickness comparison on the top so that
is the screen and then here is my iPhone
thickness comparison to the bottom of
the MacBook Air just like that then
we're going to take the whole thing and
do the thickness comparison just like so
so the whole thing is very very thin the
form factor is outstanding as you guys
are probably already aware since I am
NOT the first person on YouTube to check
one of these out here we have an SD card
reader we've got a USB slot and we've
also got a I believe that's a
thunderbolt port moving along to the
back we've got makes blacks look looking
hinge we've got some rubber
well more like plastic plastic feet here
they're going to keep you the the
rounded bottom from
creeping along the table we've got our
power connector a USB 2 port a headphone
port and that is pretty much it
not a whole lot - this thing is they're
very easy to open up the cover though
due to the the shape of the lip right
here so you can just pick it up just
like that and let's uh go ahead and turn
it on if I can figure out how to do it
sweet I love how they still make that
noise alright so actually one more thing
I wanted to go through really quick is
the expect comparison between the
MacBook Air I have and the Zen book I
have so the Zen book is one hundred and
fifty dollars cheaper and instead of a
1.7 gigahertz dual-core Core i5
processor this one has a well if I can
find it
2677 mi7 I don't even know what
frequency that is um yeah I got nothing
here guys so it has a 256 gig SSD it has
a wireless LAN Bluetooth this guy has
four gigs of ram 256 gig SSD 13.3 inch
LED backlit 1440 by 900 display they
both have integrated HD graphics
built-in webcams I'm assuming this one
as a webcam chinglish for the main
language tirado return okay headphone
port Thunderbolt port Wireless and
Bluetooth 4.0 yeah they both have
bluetooth backlit keyboard and ambient
light sensor pre-installed Mac OS X and
iLife and size and weight is here cool
okay so that was pretty much my unboxing
of the MacBook Air don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos especially if you want to stay
tuned for my Zen book coverage coming
soon okay so we have the specs now the
core i7 is actually just 100 megahertz
faster so that's a 1.8 gigahertz a
regular speed and a 2.9 gigahertz turbo
and actually one more thing to wait so
the Asus is 1.3 kilograms and the
MacBook Air is 1.35 kilograms so the
Asus ultrabook is actually lighter as
well as its other advantages</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
