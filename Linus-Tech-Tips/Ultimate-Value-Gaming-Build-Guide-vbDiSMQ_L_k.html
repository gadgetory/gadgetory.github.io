of megabit living gentlemen leave the
world and bring your friends step inside
and close the door
because we today's build guide is one
that you've asked for pleaded for
demanded - you said if you don't do some
value oriented content about stuff I can
actually afford I'm going to unsubscribe
well I heard you I heard you this video
isn't about getting a zillion frames per
second in Crysis six while running on
three 8k TVs and surround this video
isn't about liquid cooling your CPU your
graphics card and that cheeky smirk off
your buddy's face all at once
it's about getting good value and
upgradability out of your new gaming PC
without spending a whole lot of money
welcome to the ultimate value gaming PC
build guide Intel Edition to start with
a safe static free workstation is a must
I use a mod mat and an anti-static ankle
strap now the only tool we really need
for assembly is a multi-bit screwdriver
but a magnetic parts tray a pair of side
cutters and a pair of needle nose pliers
is nice to have before you begin I
always recommend verifying that the
system posts or powers on and outputs to
the display you can use your motherboard
box as a free non conductive test bench
and since this is a basic motherboard
without an onboard power button the
handy trick I'd like to show you is that
you can use your screwdriver to short
these pins if you don't have your power
button connected yet and you want to try
the board our CPU choice was all about
compromises the pentium g 32:58 gives up
multiple processing cores it gives up
hyper threading and it gives up turbo
boost it also gives up the massive cache
that the higher end has well and has
only processors in its family and joy
but Dern it this chip has spunk and with
a little overclocking it'll hold up
surprisingly well and all but the most
demanding triple-a titles even when
fighting well above its weight class
as we demonstrated in this little video
a couple of weeks ago you can easily
swap it out for a core i3 or a core i5
if you want a little bit more horsepower
though without changing anything else in
this build guide hold your CPU by the
edges and identify the corner with the
gold triangle align that with the corner
of the socket that has a triangle as
well lift up the retention arm lift up
the socket cover place the CPU into the
socket with no force lower the cover and
fasten the retention arm again
fancy coolers are the kind of thing that
rich kids with their h2 bows and LN
tubes might get to enjoy but if your dad
is a blue-collar honest working man kind
of guy well you might just find that
stock cooling does a good enough job for
a mild overclock and doesn't cost you a
penny unless you grab a can of stove
paint for 6 bucks and make it look
badass that is besides you can always
game on it now and splurge you know 30
bucks on a cooler next time you've got
some walking-around money check the
bottom of your heatsink to ensure the
pre applied thermal compound is intact
then unwrap the four pin fan connector
from the clips around the outside of the
fan orient the cooler so that your fan
wire will have the closest path to the
CPU fan header on your motherboard then
put it down on top of your CPU with the
plastic push pins at each corner
sticking through the holes on the
motherboard push down on opposite
corners until you hear it click plug the
fan connector into the board then double
check the nubbins at the back of the
board to make sure that they look like
this
buying ram is easy for a value gaming
build don't get fussed about which kit
we're using just go to your favorite
store or shopping website find the least
expensive dual channel ddr3 kit in the
capacity of your choice from a reputable
brand like kingston corsair d skill or a
data and buy it XMP support is a bonus
but the speed of the RAM doesn't matter
too much pull back the tabs on the 2
grey Ram slots then position each dim so
the notch in the bottom lines up with
the notch in the socket and press firmly
on both
fens until the tabs at the ends snap
back into place on their own sometimes I
choose a component for these build
guides because it's a super expensive
piece of hardware that I just want to
touch sometimes I do it because the
features and performance call to me and
it's a perfect match for the rest of my
build and sometimes I'm just morbidly
curious so today we'll be building in
the spec oh one because I just wanted to
know if this $50 gaming case can deliver
an experience that still lives up to the
Corsair name pull the side panels off
and stash the thumb screws somewhere
safe along with the rest of the included
hardware the cases only included 120
millimeter cooling fan is already
installed in the front which is a good
place for it since that intake is
filtered to keep the PCs guts both clean
and cool if we had beefier Hardware a
rear or top exhaust fan though would be
a good addition
now the motherboard choice is always
tough and in a value build it's even
tougher the board doesn't impact
performance so I could literally buy the
cheapest thing that will accept my CPU
and graphics card and ran and call it a
day but it does affect features so we
went with a z97 see from a soos because
it has official support for overclocking
although lower end boards even business
grade ones are known to do it and it's
got a good balance of features quality
and expandability to price press firmly
on the four corners of the i/o shield
until they snap into place then plug the
eight pin power supply connector in now
to avoid a cable management nightmare
later on place the board down on the
integrated standoffs and install the
screws that look like this into the five
positions around the perimeter of the
board the middle one can be left blank
this is just a post to hold the board in
place while you secure it while you have
easy access to the board plug in the
front power and reset switches as well
as the power and drive activity LEDs
follow up with the block style
connectors for USB to front audio and
USB 3 then finally plug your front fin
into the header on the motherboard here
so we can use software to
control it later too practical folks
there's only really a couple things to
consider when shopping for a budget
power supply price and quality me I can
be a bit of a sucker for looks so when I
saw that the 430 watt cxn is on with a
$20 rebate for only 40 bucks I went for
it it's black semi modular and 80 plus
bronze making it a solid deal compared
to the C Sonic gray unit that I normally
use for budget builds for another 15
bucks to 600 watt version though would
be good if you want a bit more growing
room but other than a quad core or a
slightly better graphics card this
system isn't really being built to be
super upgradable so the 430 watt is a
great choice slide the power supply in
grille side up for better cooling and
attach it to the case using four of
these screws you already ran the eight
pin connector when we cheated a bit in
the last step so plug in the 24 pin
connector
being cognizant of the space you'll need
behind the motherboard tray for cable
management when you try to close the
rear panel plug in a modular SATA cable
and run that over to the front bays then
plug in a PCI Express connector and run
that to this cable management hole right
here an SSD is still a no-brainer to me
even on a value build a hard drive
doesn't cost much more than a night out
at the movies with a friend who won't
stop shoving popcorn and nachos into his
or her face so in my mind it can be
added later but an SSD makes the whole
system snap here and more responsive we
went with an Intel 530 series 120 gig
drive but frankly a 300 or 700 series
drive would also be fine
grab whatever series and capacity gets
you the most gigabytes for your dollar
and go with that
pull one of the hard drive sleds out of
the side of the case and use four of
these screws to secure the SSD to it
please note that if you're installing a
hard drive at this stage you'll want to
use these screws instead slide the cage
back in plug in the SATA power connector
that you left hanging before then plug
the right angle end of a SATA data cable
into the drive and the straight end into
your motherboard choosing the best
graphics card for a value gaming rig can
be done one
two ways method number one find a recent
video card roundup find the lowest price
you can for each of the cards in it then
divide the frame rates the reviewer gets
in the games you want to play by the
price and by whichever one delivers the
best FPS per dollar method number two
buy everything else
cheeping out wherever possible and then
spend what error is left of your budget
on the best graphics card you can find
we ended up with a radeon r7 260x
because there was a good deal at amazon
when we went pricing this out so your
mileage may vary on that but the general
rule is that the low 100's too high $200
range is generally where you're going to
find the FPS per dollar sweet spot
installing expansion cards is the one
area where Corsair yeah let me down a
little bit with this case because it's
otherwise very good for the price with
folded edges to keep my fingers safe
being an awesome inclusion take out the
two screws that hold in this random
piece of metal at the back then take out
the two screws holding in these two PCI
covers that correspond with our PCIe 16x
slot align the card carefully with the
slot push it in firmly put the two
screws back in put the random piece of
metal back on and then plug in that PCI
Express power connector that was cable
managed earlier cable management is a
bit of a bear on this case or at least
it appears at first glance to be there
isn't a ton of room behind the
motherboard tray and there aren't a lot
of places to tie down wires so we're
just going to kind of do our best with
it the good news though is that the rear
side panel bulges out so installing it
over top of our slightly rat's nest II
wire arrangement here is actually no big
deal if you're not looking to spend much
on peripherals I still recommend
something halfway decent for the mouse
because it doesn't cost that much and
makes a big difference
grab an M 45 optical gaming mouse where
are no frills optical mouse from someone
like Valley for example the keyboard is
one that's not as big a deal to me and a
basic ps2 keyboard will do as well as
most gaming membrane keyboards until you
start spending
overall pretty pennies on them for
features like macro keys and
backlighting at which point I would
almost suggest just forgoing it for now
and saving up a few more pretty pennies
for a mechanical keyboard later on down
the line for the monitor anything with
gaming specific features will cost a lot
more than a commodity 23 inch 1080p
display so unless you really need HDMI
pass-through virtually no input leg-like
on Ben Q's RL series just go with a TN
for faster pixels or IPs for better
colors commodity monitor pick one that
looks nice to you and call it a day
press Delete or f2 to get into the UEFI
BIOS for the motherboard hit f7 to get
into advanced mode and turn your CPU
multiplier up to something in the 42 to
44 range you shouldn't need to touch any
other settings but while you're in here
you might as well check and make sure
your RAM is running at its rated speed
an able XMP if that option is available
to install your Windows operating system
create a bootable USB Drive and then
reboot while mashing f8 immediately to
get into the boot device selection menu
where you'll pick your USB Drive once
the setup process has begun it's
basically a matter of clicking next
until you land on the Windows desktop
once you're booted drivers can be found
on the manufacturer websites for Asus
Intel etcetera and this is a good time
to hit up ninite.com to pick up your
favorite free applications and a nice
easy to use junk where free package the
last stage here is to find out just how
well our little budget gaming rig
performs so we took it for a spin in the
most popular games many of which are
very inexpensive or even free-to-play
being streamed on Twitch TV and
discovered that if your objective is to
have a capable inexpensive gaming box to
play league with your friends that a
machine like this is going to be right
up your alley if you want to get the
most out of Crysis 3 quad core Core i5
or i7 CPU and a GPU upgrade might be in
order but this will at least get you
started as a member of the PC gaming
community now sit back and enjoy some
bland
of our finished system which I really
wish I had painted the heatsinks on the
motherboard gold on while I think
