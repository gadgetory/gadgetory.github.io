teamed up with mass drop to oh I'm
actually hyperventilating a little bit
here to bring you guys an awesome Black
Friday giveaway sign up for mass drop

ASU's prime X 370 for those of the red
persuasion it's a really good time to
buy a cooler as long as you really like
Coolermaster the hyper 212 LED is just
$15 and the hyper t2 is 10 bucks I mean

computer you might as well get one to
hold down loose papers on your desk need
more terabytes you can get a 2 terabyte
external drive from Seagate for 63 bucks
or a 3 terabyte from Western Digital for
just seven dollars more that's the one I
would personally take then if you want
to expand your internal storage you can
get a 4 terabyte Seagate Barracuda for
90 bucks now I know you're all waiting
to hear about the noteworthy graphics
card deals so here they are we've got 18
percent off of GTX 1050 TI from ZOTAC
