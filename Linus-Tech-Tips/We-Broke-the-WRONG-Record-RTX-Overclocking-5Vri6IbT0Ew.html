and then this okay bye
that's all I really want out of this so
the r-tx 2080 turned out to be kind of a
dud in terms of performance per dollar
at least until r-tx actually happens but
what Nvidia did manage to bring us with
the r-tx launch is the twenty atti now
it might be the most expensive consumer
graphics card ever but it's also the
most powerful consumer graphics card
ever almost as fast as the Titan V so if
you're anything like me you've probably
been asking yourself well how far can it
go well we could just take Jays and
Steve's words for it that wouldn't be
any fun would it this video is brought
to you by Mack Weldon Mack Weldon wants
you to be more comfortable and that's
why they've got their try on guarantee
if you don't love your first pair of
underwear you can keep it and get a full
refund so use offer code techtube to get
20% off at the link below
first order of business is setting up
our testbench with the fastest stock
card that we have on hand the msi r-tx
20 atti gaming extra on out this thing
isn't especially amazing most boards
right now are actually closely based on
Nvidia's reference design but it's got a
100 megahertz boost clock advantage out
of the box which is better than a kick
in the shorts now there are a few ways
to overclock and videos turing cards and
we're gonna start with the simplest the
new OC scanner so it's this little
button right here and what this promise
is to do is automagically get you the
best clocks possible on your card so
it's doing basically what you would do
in normal overclocking it's loading the
GPU it's gradually increasing the
frequency and then it's checking for
stability we're up to 1500 megahertz so
far this is actually pretty cool scan
succeeded average overclock is 154
megahertz one thing I'd like to add
though is that even if OC scanner does a
great job of your core clocks you're
definitely gonna want to adjust your
power target and you're gonna want to
adjust your memory clock separately
because having a look at our
overclocking results here we saw that
with an 8 percent increase in frequency
over stock we only beat our
out-of-the-box results by about 4
percent and then with mamrie thrown in
we were actually pleasantly surprised as
it turns out tuning memory on tearing is
as important as tuning the core but I am
NOT happy with our results however
pleasing they might be yet while we were
tweaking our OC for stability we hit our
first roadblock
Turing's non-adjustable
core voltage thankfully there's good
news thanks to our buddies their power
Steve from gamers Nexus and J's 2 cents
we know that with a certain mod to the
card we can actually increase the
voltage and that in spite of the twenty
eighty series is excellent thermals in
our original review once for
overclocking cooling is going to be the
mage
limiting factor and that come on screws
come on haha that is where that noise
you guys have been able to hear in the
background all this time comes in we
have brought out not one but both of the
chillers so Anthony let's do this think
so the mod is pretty simple right yeah
so we need to take the back plate off
okay we need a screwdriver kit I said we
only need to remove the back we need to
remove both so basically the card needs
to be naked MSI apparently is using the
back plate to actually cool so like
there is heat pads and stuff back there
that's what they say yeah we've heard
that story before okay so I'm pretty
sure what we're looking at yes these
guys here so these are on the input on
all three yes but it's possible that if
we do all three then the car will think
that there's an error and lock itself to
the lowest power state so probably what
we want to do is to one of the eight and
one of the six and see what happens we
can try all three up to you I mean
probably I thought you knew what you are
doing what's the first time I've done
mmm-hmm yeah this is the resistor these
here question with order so will shunt
these to fake a connector he what the
card does is it knows that this is 12
volts coming in and it also knows the
value of each of these resistors so by
measuring the voltage across these
resistors it can tell how much current
is being drawn by the card so what we're
doing is telling the card that basically
it's never drawing any current so it'll
always draw more current what a dumb
card well I'm you need to trick it this
is fun until the card is broken then
it's less fun but I mean that's
inevitable we haven't gotten there yet
it's not inevitable that looks way
better so we say don't try this at home
a lot but for real this time
really don't recommend this yeah this
will void your warranty in many
different ways you're going to yea
that's not even there's a good chance
this will break your card
thank you yeah so okay cool
uh we know that that's gonna clear the
cooler okay it's interfering so they had
to be bent down like that in order to
stay under these fins here no no this
should be fine
but four screws yeah slots I mean it's
all it had to begin with
so is afterburner all we need to test
this yeah cool so as long as we do we
need something 3d to bump it over 300
yeah probably a good idea
and so this being stuck at 300 megahertz
is bad all right I'm not hooking up the
RGB this time what no I'm not doing it
the card won't work really no oh
show me the knot 300 megahertz so here
we go yes so this is good
mm-hmm so now what you can increase the
power target okay but wait that's it
that's basically it that's the whole
unlock how do we get more voltage that's
how basically goes to a higher power
state than it would normally Wow
well hopefully that's good enough let's
throw it on the chiller so I'm just
gonna make sure that the pump on the
chiller is working here
yep it's working so as soon as we hook
the bench up boom we can go sub-zero so
I'm a little disappointed that that's
all there is we don't really get any
more dials to adjust but we are still
going to have some fun with this now the
original plan was actually to have a
full cover block here in time but it was
supposed to arrive yesterday and last I
checked it is not yesterday anymore it
is in fact today and it isn't here so we
are going to have to raw doggin a little
bit here so we've got an old style so
GPU only block and some blowing Metron
and believe it or not that is the
stretch oh wow so even though this GPU
is enormous the spacing of the mounting
holes is actually really tight so we are
gonna have to drill some new mounting
holes for this ek block here do we want
to just sit tight now I don't really see
convenient anchor points for the zip
ties so we are gonna be going full
eyeball here because measuring is very
time-consuming what the jazz it'll go
there my watch I'm not taking my watch
off I do need safety goggles on
what I know how to use a drill press yes
yes I took shop class so I'm just
pushing the bit in right now shoot I
might not have tighten the bit enough
all right now let's give it a shot I
mean how bad could it be extra holes in
there these bolts are too thick for the
holes of the card so I will return with
more nuts and more bolts dang it my
ancient collection of random water
cooling crap
might bail us out here it's gonna say
one other option is taking the drill
press to the card itself and widening
the holes okay now we find out if I got
those holes right well there's two kinds
of right right and right enough and we
are at least one of them I think I just
found an old backplate that happens to
have the same spacing what the crap
do we have thermal compound yep we're on
but it's not tight enough I need some
washers oh that's quite a bit better so
all that's left now is to replace our
CPU cooler an all-metal ek supremacy
I've got the mounting hardware here and
pull the Corsair stuff off first though
we're not going to do too much in the
way of insulation this is what is known
as a suicide run yeah let's let's start
crying out on there because I don't know
if those if those pads do sub-zero I am
gonna set up our anti condensation
solution blowing Metron pointed at the
socket area we need to get a couple of
professional sealing devices on there if
we can professional lubrication device
first okay so we need to hold on to
these blow Amite ron's when we first
start the system up to make sure that
they don't take off and or move so I've
got the one back here they will cut your
finger so by the frame is ideal yep
alright so stuffs gonna get pretty loud
here guys
okay
now I'm getting a little stressed Oh
oh yeah wants to move
mine's still not on there goes wait no
it keeps trying to spin up and not being
able to CPU fan speed or defective blah
blah blah oh but we have a post yeah
okay
oh here we go mind spinning cool okay
okay so I need to prime that Res I guess
is the idea it's just water now we got
to fire up and ck you leap now this one
just where you go just just readjust
that there a little bit there
all right this is some sketch stuff we
got going on here today
oh boy I think the CPU block is already
frosting over whose comments
yeah that's frost there we go now they
got airflow baby we need to see if that
frost is going away with the airflow
okay try 5 gigahertz okay okay posts yep
5 yeah do we want to go further let's
see if it gets the windows first
that I know that booting into Windows is
really a good litmus test but doesn't
put it 25.2 and it doesn't boot then I
know that 5 is probably stable Oh
so we have two different kinds of
blowies here I'm gonna switch this one
to the CPU socket this one is blowing so
hard it's pushing the condensation off
the block windows at 5.20 prop here so
let's just get some shop towel so we
want to make sure that that doesn't fall
down onto our board this is so dumb
well I've actually got some kind of the
saison that's made its way to the boards
now I'm not sure how to get it out
GPS seems to be in a pub a low-power
state right now what yeah we're back to
all we have when we have a to sunshine
the sooner we can get a load on the CPU
the better off we're gonna be I need
heat let me throw it up yeah that's not
stable what are we at right now five
point two okay a little more volts head
could do that okay let's see that yeah
what's the worst that can happen we blow
at $1200 GPU and a $2,000 CPU and okay
you can see it's like splashing out of
under by the socket there there's actual
splashes on the side of the RAM I am
floored that this is working still no
it's just not stable at five point two
okay so the CPU itself is not that bad
but see there's an ice chunk right there
in the socket yeah you can see how wet
or CPU is okay so everything's dried off
so I'm gonna shop towel it up a little
better than last time
I have another trick up my sleeve I'm
gonna run the heat gun
right now I lost this play out through
the window through the
although boy a - yeah it's a different
one this time you might need the boot in
the same booth if we don't get the BIOS
this time around pretty sure this is not
how this monitor is supposed to look
here we go
oh alright do Pig okay oh it's trying to
run a fifty two again which is weird
because I changed that down to wait did
I I think I figured out why we're
posting okay
so me that higher power state oh yes
okay GPU temps 28 degrees not too shabby
maybe it's not the most perfect thermal
paste application could be that it's
running firmer oh now we need to try and
push the GPU without crashing so first
we want to have a look at the Hall of
Fame here oh dang J's two cents just got
bumped out of the top ten by three
points oh wait no this is uh that's dual
GPUs so J's and Steve are both in the
top ten only one can remain well the
technically they could both remain we've
we don't we won't necessarily beat them
so we'll see if it's stable hopefully it
is no are you sure it's not the memory
but it's the zero and see what happens
all right so this is just what the core
clocks
so we just try stock speeds and see if
like it's even working
do that this is just what the power
targets turned up
all right what do we want to try then
try 175 and 850 you sir 850 850 is
stable it's a bit better
what are those other guys writing I'm
not sure okay there it goes mother it
looks like right before it crashed it
had tried to go to the higher power
state if we could lock it to a specific
power state that would be perfect but I
don't think we can do that I certainly
haven't found a way to do it
like it's entirely possible that one of
our other cards does better at higher
speeds but because of this state
transitions will be low in high power
this one is actually the most stable at
high clocks whoa
oh did something short that was the CPU
test I don't think that was the GPU that
crashed so the CPU may not be stable at
five so this is one of those movie magic
things where we go forward in time a
couple of days because a lot has changed
since the last update here so first we
figured out why the system we think was
just crashing out right while running
3dmark we were only running a thousand
watt power supply and between the
overclocked 18 core and the r-tx card we
could have easily been drawing more than
a thousand watts so we've added a second
power supply whose entire job it is is
just to wait what does this even being
used for anymore
CPU and motherboard at this point just
CPU right now okay but we weren't even
on the GPU but anyway so we've added a
second power supply we've adjusted our
temperatures a little bit we're not
going quite so cold because the
condensation was a real problem and
we've gone through a rampage six extreme
here instead of the prime board we were
using before the good news is we think
we're ready to rock you did you change
the RAM - yes now what are we using
slightly faster before we were using 29
66 right now we're using 3200 and it's
got better timing finally as we made
some adjustments to the graphics card
overclock yeah so it should be a little
bit more aggressive boosted the clock
set maximum voltage and adjusted it so
that it's less likely to crash when it's
going between power state transitions so
what's our final CPU clock speed now
final CPU clock speed is 4.8 on all
fours do we have a chance to beat Jay
and Steve with a single card here yes
they have very similar CPU clocks and
our GPU clocks are higher if we beat Jay
than we have the second highest next to
kingpin I think this is usually the part
where the graphics card will crash
so hold together bake try again shall we
I think what we really need if you want
to take it to the next level is an
overclocking room so when you're
crashing at a pretty consistent stage in
the benchmark what that means is that
something about that particular scene is
stressing the GPU in a way that's
causing it to become unstable now what
we can do here is Anthony is actually
digging around in all the different
power states of the card and the
frequencies that is trying to run it and
he's trying to smooth out that
transition so here he's looking at
exactly what clock speed we were running
at right at the moment that we crashed
and that he's adjusting that portion of
the curve when this room opens up and we
can see more of it train challenging
this is the furthest we've made it so
far for the polarizer
there's gamers in excess 80 to 85
Thursday's two-sentence 8321 if
something is wrong here
something's wrong this shouldn't be
taking 40 milliseconds per frame okay so
we're not actually sure what happened
with the CPU there but we rebooted and
it's back at 4.8 gigahertz now but
before we rerun now that we've rebooted
there's a few things we've got to do the
optimizer benchmark we've got to turn
off any unnecessary services like Adobe
update we got to wait a little bit for
Windows to finish doing all of its boot
up garbage and then we're gonna go ahead
and hopefully this is going to be it are
we expecting this to a posted by now
not necessarily
so hypothesis somewhat confirmed here
we're not actually in online mode we're
just passing through and we're going all
the way from 119 volts without firing
this up down there to as low as 112 with
3dmark running now theoretically a
computer power supply should be able to
handle something like that but we want
every advantage that we can get here so
dang it where's the thing for that red
label on top what red label okay new
plan
so I realized I don't actually know if
this is a line interactive UPS and in
the time that I could look it up I could
also just run an extension cord to our
server room where I definitely have one
of those so here we go we've got good
news that was one of the smoothest
friends I've seen I didn't notice any
hitching or any graphical anomalies
nothing like that and we know for sure
our CPU overclock is working this time
all we needed was a $15,000 line
interactive uninterruptible power supply
system yeah one thing you have to like
roll in on a dolly yeah come on maybe so
we want this we want this to be in the
30 millisecond range yeah roughly 30
milliseconds is what we're looking for
okay
we're getting the odd frame that is
taking quite a bit longer so as a
reminder even though day is on Team
Canada which we have to respect those
are the targets oh just calculate the
score
RTX over walkie part three we might have
found the overheating problem with our
CPU of course this is our flow rate
right now so we don't know exactly why
that is at this time the the coolant is
still viscous holy crap yeah block is
leaking a little bit the weirdest thing
about all of this is that if this is
gummed up somehow the coolant here is
still clear so I don't understand what
it's gummed with if this pump died
that's gonna be extremely inconvenient
so what I don't know about this block is
whether it has like an accelerator plate
or something in it something that
restricts the flow it does and we're
gummed up there's our problem we've just
got a bunch of like little debris and
crap it's probably falling into the res
from the room that's all built up on the
block you know I might even just remove
this flow plate there's our Inlet we're
gonna take that accelerator plate out
this go
yes this way and let's put this back on
and see what happens maybe we can keep
those temps under control now so we're
gonna plug the pump back in and what I'm
expecting is to see a lot more flow
that's more like it let's try again
so our CPU temps are already better we
are Sub Zero right now
we were idling at like fifteen or twenty
before minus four minus five okay let's
hit this test can't believe it if that's
what was holding us back all afternoon
so mad I just want to be like hey guys
and then yep it's clean I haven't even
seen you spike 2:35 it's clean it's
still clean so just in case this drips
down I need to get this chopped towel
here but I need a wrench to hold it down
or blowies gonna just blow it away see
just a perfect as long as our CPU is not
throttling we could see a slight
improvement to our GPU scores as well
I'm loading up the leaderboards again
one more time one more time that was a
fluke yeah fluke so this time I'm not
gonna bring out the leaderboard this has
looked like a clean run okay I'm doing
it I'm bringing up the leaderboard here
we go are you sure
come on baby why why with the suspense
what's the board finally succumb to
condensation right now Anthony you you
did all the work
submit it you got a second best in a
twenty atti
next to King okay okay
