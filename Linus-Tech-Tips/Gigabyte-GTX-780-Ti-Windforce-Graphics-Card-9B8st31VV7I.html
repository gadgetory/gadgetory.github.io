gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more it's as though
gigabyte is determined to have all of
their cards look pretty much the same
it's yet another day and yet another
wind force graphics card from gigabyte
so this one is the GTX 780 Ti wind force
it's clocked at 1020 mega Hertz base
clock 1085 megahertz boost clock it's
got three gigs on seven gigahertz gddr5
memory lynnae's 384 bit bus and unlike
the 290x wind force it is pretty much
the same price as other OC cards is
actually only about a twenty dollar
adder over a reference cooled reference
clocked card making it a very
interesting option it's got a massive
six heat pipe triple fan cooler with
their triangle cool slanted airflow
redirection block with a max cooling
capacity of 450 watts although guys it
should be noted that not all wind force
cards use this exact cooler this
particular one is very very strong 450
watts like I said it has a 6 plan and an
8 pin PCI Express connector on the top
and then that's pretty much it up there
PCI Express 3.0 16x connector on the
bottom at the back we find not a whole
lot except we did notice that this card
uses a reference PCB so in spite of the
clock speed and cooler differences it
has the same PCB as our reference GTX
780 Ti so that's a 6 + 2 phase power
design it supports the usual and video
technology so that's SLI up to 4 Way
with those 2 connectors on the top GPU
Boost 2.0 cuda physx geforce experience
so that's gameplay recording and
streaming as well as the all-new G sync
which finally has some sweet monitors to
go along with it inside the box the
usual stuffs included a couple adapters
anti-static bag driver disk etc but
we're really interested in is the
performance of this card with GPU boost
2.0 performance is directly affected by
the GPU temperatures and that should in
theory
in better clock speeds both at stock and
overclock settings at stock this was
definitely the case although likely do
as much to the much higher base clock of
the card as anything else but we
overclocked all of our cards before
testing and what we discovered is that
while the card ran relatively cool and
quiet we did not get a lucky chip and
the card actually didn't overclock as
well as our reference 780ti bear in mind
that our reference 780ti is a bit of a
beast we were lucky on that one but in
general let this be a lesson to you in
the silicon lottery there is no sure
thing we have found that reference cards
usually lose and non reference cards
usually win when it comes to
overclocking performance but here's the
proof that there are exceptions I'll
hand this over to Luke to deliver the
bad news but this card it seems like we
hit a luck of the draw
case our reference card seems to be
quite fast and with this card if I try
to make it as fast as our reference card
we actually had some problems with
artifacting and screen glitches and some
pretty serious issues it wasn't going to
run that fast
I was hitting power and voltage limits
like crazy and I just couldn't go any
higher they may or may not be some
voltage mods out there that you could
try if you run into this on your own
but I'm not going to go there it
performed absolutely quite well just not
as fast as our reference card and the
main thing that I liked about it
considering I couldn't make it go any
faster was actually how quiet and how
low temperature it was it was really not
that loud at all it was really hard to
hear which is a good thing and it
usually sat around like 70 degrees which
is actually really solid for a graphics
card so that was totally fine like and
dislike the video as always in the
comments below are you interested in
something like this a reference design
with an aftermarket cooler on it or are
you someone who's going more for
aftermarket PCB and aftermarket cooler
say that on the forums below and you'll
get more interaction there which is
great and as always subscribe to Linus
tech tips and if you're on the forum
check out the PC gaming section where
the star citizen group is we have now
become official and we want to hit those
upper-echelon we're currently the 16th
in the world for largest star citizen
team we want to get up there a little
bit more so see you guys there
