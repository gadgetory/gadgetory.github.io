today actually we have no idea if it's
gonna be a great video because as you
can clearly tell our mizu 16th not to be
confused with the mizu 16 this is anyway
it's not the 15-hour mizu 16th is
clearly still shrink-wrapped but we were
intrigued by this phone because on the
product page for it it claims to be
water-cooled and it's not the only phone
to clean that so what the crap exactly
is water cooling in phones can we can we
investigate that by perhaps taking it
apart we sure think so but we've been
known to make mistakes from time to time
speaking of mistakes this video is
brought to you by did we remember to get
a sponsor did we make a mistake last
wire allows you to instantly see your
current and past network activity detect
malware and block badly behaving apps on
your PC or Android device use offer code
linus to get 25 percent off at the link
below
so step number one would be to open the
package yeah I mean what else is cool
about this phone do you know what else
is cool bug I actually don't know
anything about this phone why did we
even pick this phone so it's got a
snapdragon 845 yeah so it's a pretty
flagship we got eight gigs of RAM 128
gigs of storage there's a 6 inch screen
3000 milliamp hour battery and an In
screen fingerprint sensor wow that's
cool
that is pretty cool what other phones
have that other than the vivo oneplus oh
really yeah the 16 so it feels pretty
phony that say that it's genuine but
like a phone Oh
to get a complete fingerprint please
peel the plastic film off so apparently
their doctrine is called fly me I've
actually never used a meizu meizu meizu
phone before apparently there is lineage
OS for it so okay do you really not
helping it feels pretty like kind of 1
plus 16 actually how do we really how do
you even you know don't Android now even
phone espanol I'll be Spanish no oh jeez
Louise well let's see what else is in
this this here box while he's taking
this hey Wilson what do you have what
BAM a charger look at that oh that is
that's big charger what is it there
another case we get two cases we got two
case it's what the heck really did the
camera died so while Brandon fixes the
camera I'm gonna go ahead and enroll my
fingerprint this is significantly slower
than the oneplus 61 like I saw I see
that it lights up under your finger yeah
Congrats
the setting is completed yaps you can't
miss oh we better get snapchat I want
sender file that looks free clean yeah
let's see what about the settings what
the heck that looks very high phony what
about the camera I've seen worse it's a
little bit cool what okay hold on I got
a go landscape for that terrible okay
yeah it's it's not great it's kind of
lifeless you know like pasty and really
white I might just become I just
basically what now we do the autopsy we
might have a
what the kids would describe as a bad
freakin time you're not I would know
that kid you're not old enough to do the
like as the kids would say no that's the
whole joke though so this just looks
like what we're just I say we try and
take the bag off you want to go back
we'll look at the screen it doesn't look
like that's the thing what it separates
I bet it does let's take the back off
what is this this is a fingerprint
scanner I don't know what the crap that
is it is a Rome flash wow you have some
huge pores sorry anyway he'll rob you're
gonna hold the big thing and I'm gonna
stick it in okay the guitar pick what
are you how are you gonna get it anyway
just kind of lick my finger here oh
there is not much of a gap there that's
cooling downside whoops how is it on
again yeah that's a good idea I think
he's wrong I think it's screams first so
I'm just gonna pursue that Avenue this
time Oh hold up wait wait wait wait wait
we're penetrated boys oh yes that is hot
on my very bare hands oh there we go
that looks like some adhesive holding on
to that there
Wow there's no connection say nice
whatever it was only like 400 bucks why
did you just turn it off I'm just
curious making sure we didn't break it
this is YouTube putting its best foot
forward
security guard pranks satisfying slime
death wish dangerous riders seven
riddles that will test your brain that
was fun
so it works and we got it open how are
we gonna keep track of where these go I
thought we weren't putting this back
together why aren't we putting it back
together if you just remember it's fun
no I'm not gonna remember and you're not
gonna remember you're probably all the
same size screws anyway they're probably
not why would you say something like
that
that's such a stupid thing to say
there's actually a fairly warranty there
so yeah wait no cuz there's the haptic
feedback thing so does this speaker
yeah speaker magic we opened this up and
it actually didn't have water yeah let's
not scammed what the hell are they
talking okay so what you're saying then
is we should have gone in from the
screen I don't know if we can I mean I
actually don't know if looting we should
probably take the battery connector off
before we continue yeah we probably
should oh wait is this a tab no no look
at that careful don't bend it too much
just they thought of that you stick a
long pro beeping under here no no
plastic ones please please Jake
I still don't pull why than to pretty go
man look at this it's got like extra
antenna mounting spots like lots of them
fingernails the proper tool that's what
Luis Rossman told me is it yeah it's
taking reals
I don't know it's weird yeah that's like
it is we didn't take the SIM tray oh hey
look there's the copper thingy
that's it no but wait it's probably goes
underneath yourself that's their water
cooling I don't think we have all of it
out of there yet it's got to be thin
it's a phone that's how that works yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah Oh point four
millimeters thick point four millimeters
so basically there's our SOC everything
else has shields over it so it's
actually kind of hard to tell exactly
where the storage is if I had to guess I
would say and flash is probably under
here or DRAM looks about that size but
what we're after is the cooler so you
can see that's where they've got the
thermal compound between it again is
presumably our SOC and the water cooling
solution what is it I don't think we
really get it out of there but we can
expose more of it okay I'll be right
back the kids have gone to bed we can
get some serious work done around here
nice I feel entirely comfortable being a
gist to you because you treat me exactly
the same you know it's just because
you're old okay Wow
he's doing it with metal is that it
that's the most we can expose that can
we take it apart more I mean do we want
to be able to put it back together or
you don't care at this point no I want
to give the people what they came for
okay we could cut it in half
what's inside just start like scratching
at it
Linus rigged everything oh wow that's a
cool guy I love what he does he's just
better at it than we are so I'm gonna
let him do the scratching you know what
I don't even care because that you know
what that's as deep as we're going
because I want to flip this phone on
eBay when we're done so basically what
is water cooling
what is water cooling this dude you want
to go grab a prop for us when I go grab
like a water cooler oh I was gonna bring
a heat sink
no deep you know no you're not watching
what hey can you go get a water cooler
oh yeah yeah I know I know you're
talking about yeah he was gonna okay so
basically what you're looking at here is
I think calling it a water cooler is a
little disingenuous but you actually
could make the argument that it's a
fluid cooler at the very least because
what's happening is we've got a flat
base so that allows it to make optimal
contact with whatever type of processor
whether it's a CPU GPU SOC whatever type
of processor you're trying to cool and
then right under it and it really is
actually very impressive how thin
they've managed to make this this kind
of tube shape you might say it's kind of
like a pipe yeah it got down to helps
with the heat you know and also this
aluminum heatsink that it's embedded in
it's really really impressive how thin
it is but what it is is a heat pipe so
it's actually the exact same technology
that you would find in what we would
traditionally described as an air cooler
sorry I mean water cooler I'm gonna
start calling them fluid coolers and the
reason I'm gonna call them that is
because the way a heat pipe works is
right here okay so first of all these
the inside of them is usually at very
low pressure like near vacuum and then
in the factory you'll always know to
set one end of the heat pipe you're
gonna have a nice clean termination see
that and then at the other end you've
got kind of this mess where it was
crimped off and sealed so that's because
these are at very very low pressures so
the low-pressure affects both the
boiling point of the fluid inside and
the condensation point so what happens
is here at the heat source even though
the difference in temperature between
here and here the fluid because remember
both liquids and gases are fluids the
fluid will boil which will cause it to
go to the end of the tube and then over
at the end of the tube where there is a
fan blowing air through it to cool it or
your hand which is effectively kind of
like liquid cooling the phone like
because your blood is pumping or yes so
the point is that at the other end where
that fluid is then being cooled it turns
back into a liquid and then there is
usually on the inside either sintering
or like some kind of wicking texture to
the inside of the heat pipe that causes
that liquid to wick back to the point
where it's heated up again so you end up
with this kind of this flow so is it
water cooling not in the way that we
would traditionally define water cooling
because we've typically referred to this
as heat pipe air cooling but there is
fluid involved and in some cases heat
pipes are actually filled with a fluid
that is either completely or mostly
water so it's it's possible it's
water-cooled but I'm gonna call it fluid
cooling from now on to be fair did you
say do you think water is in it's in
quotes only water so maybe they're like
