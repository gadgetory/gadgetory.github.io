tech tips Twitter and Instagram you'll
already be aware that there was recently
a crisis at our headquarters sorry sorry
it's still a little difficult for me to
talk about this but I became aware after
returning from a brief absence that
someone had been at my desk touching my
things sorry excuse me
so naturally at that point there were
two avenues available to me the first
would be calm measured discourse with my
trusted employees about the importance
of respecting one's personal space and
possessions while the second would be to
over-engineer some manner of mechanical
deterrent that would give any
interlopers a much-needed taste of
justice so in the end I decided well
let's just say this isn't a video
detailing how to host a discussion about
office protocol
mass drop is currently featuring their
exclusive k7 XX red headphones built by
AKG learn more and buy one today at the
link in the video description meet the
enforcer out of the box the elite strike
rhino fire is a fully automatic fixed
point anti-personnel nerf gun with a 2.8
dart per second rate of fire and arc
range of up to 81 feet and a 50 dart and
munition drum capacity it's a beast in
its own right but it only works when I'm
around to operate it which means I
needed to turn this hefty foam blaster
into a fully automated motion detecting
stationary sentry turret so to
accomplish this we'll need the following
three servos an Arduino a webcam and a
laptop to coordinate at all not to
mention some quick rewiring and just a
touch of fine woodworking now in much
the same way that you can't make an
omelet without breaking a couple of eggs
you can't modify a nerf gun without
first voiding the crap out of the
warranty so step one then is to
carefully mind you these things are over
a hundred bucks disassemble the rhino
fire our main objective here is to
access the internal wiring but the
lighter our gun is the easier will be
for our servos to turn it and the
aptly-named Rhino has a little more junk
in the trunk than we'd like out of the
box which means we'll want to remove our
bulky trigger assembly not to mention
the six D cell batteries that also have
got to go once the gun is in pieces this
is also a great time to give it a quick
makeover doing it upright involves
laborious ly sanding off all the logos
then taping and painting in layers etc
etc etc but that's literally as
interesting as watching paint dry
so we're going to skip over that with
some video magic ah much better so as
you can see we've removed some excess
weight at the back pulled out the
battery pack and isolated the internal
switch
that turns on the motor next we need to
assemble the body of the turret that
this will sit on this bottom box is
where we install the webcam and laptop
so it needs to be nice and roomy our
first servo goes inside the top of the
box and the gun bracket is mounted on
top which allows rotation along the
x-axis
we want to keep the load on the servos
as light as possible especially when at
rest which means keeping the weight off
of the moving components themselves now
our first plan was to simply place this
ring of ball bearings between the box
and the gun bracket but during the
prototyping stage we found that to be
insufficient the wood was just too rough
and the bearings were too small for this
to be an effective solution so the way
we solved that then was to layer the
ring of ball bearings between some
discarded CDs thanks AOL that we
attached to the wood the CDs are the
perfect size though some minor
modification was necessary to make room
for the servo and they're smooth enough
that the bearings were able to roll
properly greatly reducing the strain on
our servos now that we had turn we
needed tilt good news though the Rhino
comes with a tripod mount already that
is located close to center mass so we
gently modified this to allow a dowel to
be inserted the dowel fits into two ball
bearings that are housed in wood panels
on either side allowing for ease of
movement since the gun isn't perfectly
balanced we added some small weights
until it required very little effort to
tilt it up and down now our server all
installed at the end of the dowel can
tilt the gun more quickly drastically
improving the ability of our sentry to
track its target so with the wood frame
built we next mounted the remaining
servos the Arduino and our battery packs
now while our initial plan was to wire
the internal motor of the Rhino directly
to the Arduino in the end we decided to
go with a third servo and a 3d printed
prong controlling a mechanical switch
and with all of that in place we just
needed to neatly wire it all together
then hook it up to the laptop and webcam
in the base and run the software that we
downloaded from Project sentry gun
Rudolf labs comm a super awesome
open-source sentry project that you
should totally check out by the way now
I'll take a moment to give you guys a
quick pro tip when you set out to do a
wiring job like this no matter how small
the project is or how simple you
initially assume it will be pick up at
least two different colors of wire red
and black for positive and negative are
pretty standard don't just get one color
because you're confident that you can
keep everything straight and you think
green is pretty you will end up four
hours deep into the project surrounded
by hastily marked wires from five
different motors in two different
batteries in a hopeless tangle deeply
confused and full of regret so so much
regret alright let's get back on topic
before our final test we've got one more
housekeeping item our final job looks a
little messy so hey can we get some of
that video magic going on here I guess
we're just gonna have to embrace the
whole junkyard chic aesthetic thing
testing time
success
I can now feel comfortable leaving the
office knowing that my tools pens and
prawns will rest unmolested of course
for the majority of the time when I'm
here I don't actually want this thing
hovering behind me so I needed to find a
way for it to pull double duty
fortunately with the help of a little
open-source facial recognition software
it can be easily repurposed as an
employee morale booster now that's what
I call a motivational tool satisfaction
