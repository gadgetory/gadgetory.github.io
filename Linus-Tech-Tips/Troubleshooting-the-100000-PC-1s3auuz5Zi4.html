so I'm actually really excited about
this project as you guys can see I have
moved all of these six workstations one
CPU stuffed into our conference room so
anyone who wants to have a meeting or a
conference call or whatever else has
like a third of the table to work with
now but there's a good reason for it
I actually like I need all this space in
order to spread out all the things I
need to connect to it in order to make
sure that it is actually working because
while I have done a little bit of
validation like theoretically I haven't
yet actually hooked up like a whack of
video cards to a monitor and made sure
that the whole thing is actually
functioning as it's supposed to the
other thing I'm going to be doing today
and this is actually the main reason for
the stream because otherwise this is the
kind of thing I would just work on in
the corner of my office and the shadows
and then finally bring to light when
it's time to make the video the other
thing is I got what might be a really
important pro tip from none other than
Wendell from level one text about why he
thinks here I'm just gonna move this
monitors like really cool cuz it takes
it's got six different display inputs or
something like that and it can do four
at a time
tiled across the display so that's
that's cool but it's really heavy so he
had an idea for how we could achieve
hot-plug ability for our VMs by using an
additional tag on our iommu group ICS
override thing so basically that's
that's what we're gonna do today and
we're coming along for a voyage of
discovery because I'm not sure how any
of this is gonna work theoretically I've
got everything re plugged in since I
moved it over from the other room so
we're gonna go ahead and hook it up and
I do have one extra trick because now
that I've got four graphics cards not
six yet just four because I didn't
a couple more monitors in here where's
where's this going right so now that
I've got four displays what I wanted to
do was make sure that the onboard video
on this thing is working properly
so that I can use that for my hypervisor
so I'm going to use that for unread and
then each of my six graphics cards that
I'm going to use my seventh slot for
this breakout cable to the daughter
board so each of my six graphics cards
can be passed through to a virtual
machine I mean is it a virtual machine
anymore when you are able to sit down
like add a keyboard and mouse and
monitor and use it like hot plug USB
like is that a virtual machine anymore
or is that like a a real machine but
using virtualization no one knows all
right so just waiting for it to boot up
there we go okay that's good
a tube don't you love it when you go
live and immediately something doesn't
work I'm not sure what postcode a2 is
maybe it's just one of those things
where if I press like go into the BIOS
or something it'll pick up can you see
that Brandon got a 2 over here so I had
I had changed it already to use the VGA
as the primary display output but I
hadn't actually seen that working yet
here well there you have it guys is real
you know real tech troubleshooting here
they pick up Brendan you did oh no I
mean up yeah it's not going on over oh
no I think I know what happened
sometimes the server boards so now
actually I'm not sure if this is what
happened because it's possible that I
was the one who moved this but sometimes
they ship with the onboard VGA disabled
with a hardware jumper and so what I'm
hoping is that by moving this little
this little header here normally pins 1
&amp;amp; 2 are enable and pins 2 &amp;amp; 3 are
disabled you can tell pin 1 by the
little silkscreen white square behind it
so I'm pretty sure I just put it to pin
1 &amp;amp; 2 yeh ok
oh I thought we were off to a pretty
rough start here ok
that should be better so we should be
able to boot it up so basically just a
recap for those of you who didn't watch
the video where I was talking about six
workstations one CPU and the goal here I
want you to come over here so I can show
them the daughterboard here so what
we're doing is we're using two of them
tells 28 core Xeon Platinum's
and we're using virtualization in an
attempt to create out of a single tower
6 8k video editing capable workstations
that people could use
currently like all at the same time to
edit 8k video off of a single
motherboard but one of the biggest
problems at least from my perspective
with using a VM as like a daily driver
workstation is that if you want to use a
USB device like a keyboard or a mouse or
a thumb drive even you actually have to
plug it into the system and then through
your hypervisor you have to configure
that USB device to be passed through to
your virtual machine before you boot so
if you wanted to oh I don't know say for
example plug in a card reader so that
you could offload some footage from an
SD card you wouldn't be able to do that
without shutting down your machine
reconfiguring some nonsense and then
turning it back on the way to get us be
hot plugging so that allows you to just
plug in and unplug USB devices like you
normally would is to take an entire
controller so you can see here I've got
this daughter board that's got a whack
of USB controller cards plugged into it
here you take an entire controller
and you pass that through to the virtual
machine that way anything that you
unplug or plug in to that controller is
hot pluggable for that VM now if you're
only running like two VMs like we did in
to gamers one CPU you can actually take
multiple USB controllers built into your
motherboard this one has at least two on
it and you can pass one of those through
to one of the VMS and one of those
through to the other or something along
those lines as long as you don't pass
through too many and you leave nothing
for the hypervisor assuming that you
need one there but if you've got like
six there's no other board that I'm
aware of that has like six USB
controllers on it so we reached out to
one stop systems with the idea that if
we could take one of their daughter
boards here which takes there's a link
card that you can't really see but you
can see it from the back here I'll try
and get you know from the back so you
take this link card here and it takes
your PCI Express slot runs it over a
cable so this is just PCI Express over a
cable sends it to this target card and
then takes that 4x pcie 3.0 link
correctly and splits that out into eight
slots here so as long as not everybody
is like hitting their USB port with a
PCI or with a like USB 3 SSD external
drive or something at the same time that
should be fine because this board is
using the same kind of technology that
your motherboard already uses to split
out the lanes on the CPU to all the
different slots and all the different
devices that are built into it so it's
using a plx chip these are quite
expensive their server or grade hardware
but I mean hey this is a crazy project
and you got to kind of you got to do
what you got to do so normally I'm gonna
show you guys oh bloody hell
I'm gonna show you guys the command line
version of unread here
sorry I just I have to I have to reboot
it I want to use the GUI version here
just to make my life a little bit easier
so normally when you would boot up a
system like this or for virtualization
what your motherboard does is it groups
your resources all of your devices into
what are called iommu groups and then
anything that is in the same iommu group
has to be forwarded to the same vm so
it's pretty typical for something like
the VGA device and the HDMI audio device
on a single graphics card to share an
iommu group mind you that wouldn't
normally be a problem I can't think of
too many situations where I would want
to have the video device and the audio
device for a single graphics card go to
different virtual machines that doesn't
make a ton of sense but you can also run
into issues where for example on a
motherboard you might have your SATA
controller and your network controller
on the same iommu group so if you wanted
to pass an ethernet controller through
to your VM you would also have so you
would not be able to pass that SATA
controller through to another one so
what happened last time around
was that while this motherboard is very
virtualization friendly even when we
enabled the ACS override little
hack that you can do we still have like
I think we had something like 80 iommu
groups it's a very virtualization
friendly but what happened was that even
though almost every device on the board
could be split out individually all
those devices that were on that daughter
board we're in the same I Oh mmm you
group which makes sense because they're
all running off of the same slot so what
that meant was that while we could pass
through one USB controller to one of our
VMs running off that one slot we weren't
going to be able to get the multi slot
expansion that I wanted so that I could
send a separate USB controller to every
one of my VMs and have every one of the
editors working off of this thing able
to have their own USB hot plug now I'm
you know obvious solution to that would
be just get another board with more PCI
Express slots in the first place but
those are rare and/or exceedingly
expensive and normally designed for use
in a custom enclosure that's like system
specific so if you guys remember from
eight gamers one CPU which was actually
ten depending on how you slice it we
actually had a server enclosure that
could take ten graphics cards and I
think we managed we managed to put like
one other like network card in it or
something along those lines so the thing
had like it was like 10 or 11 PCI
Express slots or something along those
lines but that's it was like a rack
mount servers it sounded like a jet
turbine like it wasn't suitable for use
as like a video workstation alright so
yeah we go
boop-boop and let's go ahead and start
the array so settings
know it's tools I was writing system
devices okay
so here we're gonna see with the ACS
override which is a little tweak that
you can do in order to try to split out
devices that are sharing an iommu group
we're gonna see that all of our USB
controllers are on the same one but
Wendell told us that there
an additional flag that we can enable
called multifunction that might actually
help us split them out even though
they're all running off of the same PCI
Express slot so here you're gonna want
to come in and have a look at this
Brenner and see if I can controller USB
here they are
yeah so here's our I Oh mmm you group 70
which has got a bunch of plx bridge
nonsense going on on it that makes sense
because that's exactly what this thing
is doing its using plx plx pci express
bridges in order to split that one lane
out into alright excuse me split that
one slot out into many slots and you can
see here all six of the cards that I
have installed so here's that of kwanzaa
10 gigabit ethernet card this board
doesn't have onboard 10 gig and we're
definitely gonna need 10 gig for 6
people to be able to edit 8k footage at
the same time and then we've got here we
go 5 USB controllers but we would have
to pass these all through to the same VM
which completely defeats the purpose so
this is sort of the moment of truth
where we find out if the stream had any
purpose whatsoever let's just do both of
them so it might be as simple as this
and apply now we're gonna reboot oops
reboots not there oh there's so many CPU
cores I have to scroll for days just to
get past them all it's a very very first
roll problem of course now we're gonna
reboot and see if that fixes it
this is why we usually use the magic of
video editing in order to cut this like
waiting around out like even when you
guys watch even something that's like a
I think I think the one where I was
trying to get hot plug PCI Express was
that like a 20 minute video Brennen 20
25 minute video something like that that
was days it was like over a day of
actual like shooting that was why you
had so much okay cut you know you can
cut okay cut and the worst part is that
when you're working on server hardware
instead of working on like more wait was
I'm using this board oh yeah that one
wasn't even that bad when we're working
with actual server hardware it is a
nightmare because those boards instead
of taking like 2 minutes to reboot they
can take 5 minutes 6 minutes 8 minutes
to reboot especially when you've got
like a whack of raid controllers each of
which has a bunch of drives on it like
our 45 drive servers so they're super
mikro boards in the first place which
means they already take a few minutes to
do a reboot then they each have anywhere
from 3 to 4 raid controllers each of
which has their own boot up and
initialization process they go through
and each of those raid controllers has
in the neighborhood of I think it's us
12 to 16 drives or 11 to 16 drives or
whatever it works out to so about 15
drives each on them in some of those
servers so they can take when I'm
troubleshooting some some stupid thing
they can take like 10 minutes per reboot
cuz you got to wait around for the OS to
load as well right ah it's brutal so I'm
really hoping that this is just gonna be
a super simple thing and you guys aren't
gonna be just tuning into this live
stream for no no payoff all right come
on show me the boot options I mean even
this like a like a more like a prosumer
like a workstation grade board when you
have this many devices that it has to
load up every time it turns on it's a
bit of a chore there we go
OOP
hope everybody's having a great Friday
out there I'm sorry I'm not monitoring
chat at all I have no idea what you guys
are saying it's chat entertained oh
really
yeah oh well that's nice thank you hey
Brandon do you want to do you want to
show you know what let's do proofs in
the pudding proofs in the pudding baby
oh yeah let's do some pudding proof no
no come on over here let's there we go
here we go
are we streaming live yes we are yes we
can all right let's go back and see if
there and see if it's booted up I know
my hair is so bad right now thank you
for pointing it out it's more than just
the neckline that's bad it's just
everything about it is terrible I need
to go get a haircut but it's like you
know personal appearance play with
computers would you guys even like me
that much if I was like perfectly
groomed all the time I think I think
what just happened okay
we lost our displays signal now we get
signal main screen on perfect I think
okay start the array I'm not actually
sure if I have to do that whatever shut
up oh shoot
I've got a weird thing with this install
where I don't know what the crap it's
doing but it keeps losing my cache
drives every time I reboot it for some
reason
so no device
yeah no device let's go this one let's
see if that's the right order usually
doesn't matter that's so weird I've
never seen this before
also I screwed up my vm's and I put them
on the wrong I didn't put them on the
cache anyway so it actually probably
doesn't matter but anyway anyway anyway
moment of truth moment of truth
morning you are booted with peas ride
etc etc come on baby this doesn't tell
us the island of new groups yet we got
to wait around for this to load because
if this works halt this project gets so
much cooler like it becomes actually
usable for those wondering I'm not
really planning to make my editors do
this looks really promising look at this
our VGA and audio devices are split up
into their own groups now hold on a
minute where are they we have we have a
hundred and we have a hundred Oh every
one of these is split out oh no way we
have two hundred iommu groups on this
thing now almost every single device is
in its own group including our USB
controllers so theoretically now we can
stub them and pass them through the VMS
and have the whole thing work just like
sitting in front of the computer because
remember guys with USB you can connect
anything now like it used to be USB was
just for like your your flash drive and
like your mouse but probably not your
keyboard cuz you were probably using ps2
for that but now if we have a couple of
USB 3 ports for each VM well now all of
a sudden you've got you know extra audio
device options and USB audio devices are
great these days like there's there's
almost nothing that you would plug
because remember we don't need land like
there's nothing you would have on the
back of a motherboard that you couldn't
have through USB if you've got hot plug
oh that is fantastic ok next step then
wow that's a lot of scrolling oh this is
fantastic
okay what's going on with this VGA
connection here looks a little flaky
actually okay stop messing with me stop
messing with me I'm having a good day
oh that's tremendous okay I already
wrote these down ahead of time so that I
wouldn't have to go and refer back and
forth to the pages so just give me a
quick sec here and I'm going to pull up
my thing
what not now not now I am live-streaming
okay here we go
so multifunction blah blah blah okay so
it's PCI stub ah IDs equals and then
we've got okay it was 1b 21 :
12:42 comma I'll explain what this is in
a minute 1033 : zero yep zero one nine
four and one nine one two zero zero one
five and then I think it's just a space
yeah okay that should be right so I'm
just gonna grab that I'm gonna copy it
to the GUI mode as well mm-hmm oh no
I've already I've got that there must
have been tooling around with that
before
I often reuse my I'm raids so
multifunction blah blah blah okay yes
that looks good to me
okay so we got a reboot now because what
we just told our machine to do is to
okay so what we just told our machine to
do was to take those PCI identifiers x'
so what those numbers are is the first
four digits are the the manufacturer
identifiers so Intel for example that
would be eight zero eight six which is a
reference
and tells original 8086 processor but
most most other manufacturers are much
harder to read remember it's like a
seemingly random string of letters and
numbers and then what the second for
after the colon what the second for for
is the unique identifier for that
particular hardware device so in the
case of our USB controllers here what
we've done is we've looked up you know
silverstone and this particular USB
controller card and what we've done is
we have told the operating system the
Unrated operating system that when it
initializes it's going to ignore these
devices it's it's not gonna it's not
going to load them it's going to leave
them so that we can pass them through
entirely uninhibited to virtual machines
so it's called stubbing oh this is going
to well and yes it's live haters
pre-recorded live streams who would do
that monsters that's who okay that was a
good time to boot up system let's go
baby don't let me down
b2 okay no no I mean I had a I had a
feeling this might work but like seeing
it work is always different because I've
had a lot of feelings that a lot of
things might work over the years by
Wendell Wendell never lets me down when
the level 1 techs go check out level 1
techs after you're done with this live
stream not before but go check out level
1 text because that guy knows his shiz
he was over here for our gaming on Linux
thing a lot of people were upset that
our gaming on Linux video didn't mention
natively gaming on Linux and I have to
confess we sort of took that for granted
I think this is one of those cases where
between me Wendell and Anthony we all
sort of assumed that people would be
aware
you can just play games on Linux with
like the Linux version of steam and
stuff but we had a lot of people really
upset because they felt like we made it
seem like gaming on Linux was more
complicated than it is because we
ignored just running games on Linux
natively like firing up looking-glass
and all this your wine and all this kind
of stuff fair point but I think actually
we've got a really good opportunity to
to rectify that with a new gaming on
Linux video that's entirely dedicated to
gaming just on Linux because steam has
their whole windows games on Linux thing
that they announced quite recently
actually and we're we're really really
interested in taking a look at that okay
hopefully I design those correctly let
started okay I mean this is all still
theoretically actually what this thing's
problem is it's been stupid he's gonna
deal with that kind of stuff okay so I
didn't pay attention to the serials so
I'm actually not sure if this is gonna
work
yep there we go we're good all right so
my cat so weird I always see the weird
stuff when you go alive you know okay so
let's just make sure everything's
looking good here what what oh for
crying out loud okay he's only supposed
to come in if like my audio dies or
something guys are messing with me here
and he knew that he knows he's be
everything's be everything's okay alarm
this is going off everything's fine no
not necessary okay
USB wait what oh wait no we're expecting
this yes okay so wait here's an as
MediaOne and he said okay yeah no these
are still here so that's fine I guess
let's go ahead and have a look at what
we got here and hmm that's interesting I
only see one of them that is not so
these are USB devices so this is the
conventional pass-through method and
then this is one of our controllers but
what I would be expecting to see is
multiples in there oh oh maybe I screwed
something up in here now I'm now I'm
stressed out now I'm really stressed out
oh wait hold on why is there a line
break here is that affecting me I'm sure
there are like Linux wizards out there
they were like yes that is affecting you
actually didn't notice that before okay
let's just make sure I typed these right
one be twenty one twelve forty two ten
thirty three zero one nine four nineteen
twelve zero zero one five yep that's
right okay let's see if that line break
was messing us up because if only one of
those is showing up then it looks like
this might not have worked at all which
would be really really disappointing
right about now oh hey just so you guys
know this is fun here's our process for
making sure that our thumbnails are
exactly as poisonous as they need to be
so the editor goes through and sends me
a preview and I say yes that is
appropriately poisonous or not
appropriately poisonous this is actually
going to be a really fun video I think
you guys are gonna enjoy it Brendan and
I shot this this was one of those ones
where nothing went right because we were
trying to demonstrate the Windows
activation servers rejecting the
activation of our Windows once we
changed a bunch of hardware and they
didn't what I think is that within a
certain period of time maybe of initial
install or maybe within Hardware changes
it might assume oh you're you're
troubleshooting and ignore you but I'm
sure there's like a machine learning
algorithm that tries to find the people
who are actually moving the hardware to
a different or moving the license to a
different machine incorrectly but anyway
what I do is I explain why a lot of the
time when we do screen capture or when
you look at my screen in my office
there's that activate Windows thing and
though the video is gonna be called why
does Linus pirate windows and I assure
you guys there's actually a very good
explanation so you should definitely
watch that I assume that's going out
like this weekend or something oh I
should probably reply to him that looked
pretty good to me though looks good nice
I swear this is taking longer to boot up
every single time oh you know what we
can use this time on actually this is
good so my plan today assuming that
everything goes well is actually to use
this monitor and I've got all four of
these graphics cards plugged into it is
to use this monitor to actually get four
VMs running so that's why I've got all
these keyboards and mice and all this
space laid out for us so we can try and
get things actually working yes what can
I do for you so are we running out of
power
apparently we have no what okay thank
you oh crap did I missed that oh bloody
hell ah you know what I'm not gonna wait
for another reboot here Brandon where do
you want this plug didn't you say how do
i plug it in yeah okay
turn it till it feels right now baby
okay we're good all right you know what
I'm just gonna run and get my laptop so
I can admit it over the network I just
need my laptop but I have my microphones
remember private Internet access is what
oh they're the sponsor from the stream I
didn't know we had a stream sponsor well
heck yeah brother yeah all right yeah
come in and interrupt me when I'm trying
to just do something for with no sponsor
and they're like all right fingerprint
let's go let's go there we go all right
it's chewing this up man so I didn't
check the line break on the headless one
or the non goo evil and not headless
logs it's intended to be used endlessly
so about 20 of 0.22 so now you guys can
see I'm looking at the same interface
that I was that I was using before
actually you know what I could do is I
could just hook this up to that monitor
then we wouldn't have to really change
what we're doing but that's fine not
flustered I'm just doing it live which
is always a little bit stressful OOP
yeah stupid thing the cache is doing
that we'll get it cache drive weird news
science finds working okay so now you
know what let's let's do that let's go
ahead and use my test cart my amazing
test cart that you guys probably
remember from this PC can fly or we
built a flying piece of here whatever
whatever we called the video just gonna
plug this in don't grab these this is
exactly the right amount of regular USB
Taipei's for a modern laptop to have -
is is fine all right
we'll switch I think oh no that's auto
adjustment apparently maybe that one
there now we'll never know the
difference
okay so I am hoping yeah I'm hoping yeah
that's what I'm hoping check this out
okay so you might have noticed I only
entered three device IDs that's because
these two renesis controllers are the
same so if you stub one you have to stub
both but that's fine and then these two
as media ones are the same model the SN
1142 and then finally we've got the
super old NAC one from before renesis
took over any C's USB 3 host controller
things like the og USB controller so
that is flippin exciting we've got 5 USB
controllers and now all we need to do
now all we need to do is try it actually
ah well let's let's go oh gee NEC let's
pick a let's pick a graphics card here
shall we
Oh which one which one do we want you
know what let's take the top slot so
that would be the Quadro P 5000 right
there
sound card oh lordy Oh probably this one
oh yeah
probably that one 3 C 0 0.1 yep probably
ok ah 9 course update so if everything
went according to plan one of these
quadrants here is gonna light up let's
have a look over here Brendan so I don't
actually know if this thing is on now it
is HDMI one oh crap what
unexpectedly closed the monitor
operation not permitted
let's try ws2 Oh had the NEC one there
for some reason let's see if that was
the problem
come on baby don't let me down
show me the start little triangle oh
that's not good
that's bad the sound cards bugging us up
let's just try without sound for now we
can cross that bridge when we get to it
come on
okay in the meantime why don't we try
one of the other cards here let's try
the gtx 1060 with the renaissance
controller whoa hey it should be lit up
now they're ready
there it is okay that just like happened
in the background well I wasn't paying
attention which controller did I plug it
into only one way to find out
hold on USB gaming mouse is set up and
ready that's a good sign that's a really
good sign nope that's a function that's
windows lock wait what do I even have
anything plugged into that card oh wait
I mean if it wasn't detected yet maybe
that's the issue come on you bastard
this one's got the num lock eliminated
that's a good sign no nothing yet I
might have to actually go back in like
trace for the cable and ws2 is booted up
so this is this is the real acid test
seeing two of these VMs booted up and
having them both be hot pluggable is a
very solid indicator that we are going
to be able to do all six because that's
the limitation we're trying to get
around not being able to wait not being
able to do to pass through the cards
plugged into that daughterboard
to two VMs to two separate VMs sorry I'm
getting distracted because I actually
have to like think now this is this is
much much further than I thought we were
going to get today this is turning into
a very long stream we're trending wow
has anything this hardcore IT trended on
YouTube in years this is like actual
tech stuff not like a phone no offense
to phones phones are great I like phones
too as much as the next Mouse is working
hey Mouse is working okay
well why isn't the keyboard working wait
hold on a second why isn't the keyboard
working okay well you know no this is
good news so I just got to find the
other end of that USB cable what which
one is it this one
ooh where's that going did it did it did
it in tracing Oh for cryin out loud
didn't have a keyboard plugged into this
card
okay so then this is it this is the test
we're gonna use that bloody keyboard so
this is it this is the NEC card right
here okay and then this keyboard should
light up which it did and okay I'm going
one two three four actually yeah this
keyboard was in the right spot already
and then this mouse should go here and
we should be able to yes hot plug check
this out look at this no pad I'm a type
some cheese Yeow
yes okay that's good but I want to see
another one light up first so WS to hear
they have a look
is the 1060 so the 1060 is here the 1060
is plugged into HDMI in four but for
some reason even though this is booted
up this is not lighting up and I'm not
sure why that would be input here we go
oh well that's why because this is
configured to
hdmi 3 so why don't we try that oh and
you can clearly see this was already
working so there's that alt tab but but
okay I'm trying to temper my excitement
here because we're not entirely out of
the woods yet it is still possible that
hot-plug will not work on both of them
so where's my where's my mouse for that
one let me have a look here always the
last one I mean it always has to be the
last one because why would you keep
trying if you already found the one that
works all right it's always the last one
you try anyway oh okay so I need to get
together into the Cougar see I had all
different keyboards and mice here that
was the plan because I was planning
based on my results last time to have to
use different ones because when you pass
through USB devices to the ends if you
don't pass through the controllers
because okay remember when I was
stubbing things if you guys were
watching before when you put in a
hardware ID you can only stub like all
of them or none of them well USB
controllers have like a similar or USB
devices have a similar issue so when you
pass through a USB device to a VM you
have to pass through all of that USB
device so if I had six keyboards and six
mice that all matched they would all
have to go through to the same VM so
that's why I had a bunch of different
ones but now now that I can pass through
controllers and even same types of
controllers like I have to stub them all
at once but I can pass each individual
one through now that I can do that I can
have all matching peripherals and that
will make that will make my OCD excited
okay so the cooler one is here so let's
go ahead and unplug it and the bloody
one well I really wish I had like a
thing so exciting because now we're
going to
hold on a second that's okay so now
right so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna Alex and I have a whole plan laid
out for this already we're gonna like
this salad do another case or we're
gonna custom fab something so all these
are gonna be secured really like
professionally you know that cool stuff
oh I'm so excited right now okay if this
works we should be good yes yes it's
alive
the project is alive let's go ahead and
task manager' this up so you can see
here each of my VMs one on the left
actually looks a little cleaner I don't
know what's going on with the resolution
here this might not actually have the
right drivers installed but each of them
has okay 18 virtual processors so that's
nine course and then nine hyper threads
18 for this one the same thing nine
cores nine hyper threads we're gonna try
and split it really evenly down the
middle so in theory each each CPU will
have three VMs so we'll be sharing six
channel memory across three VMs so we
shouldn't actually have to have this VM
talk to this CPUs Ram almost at all so
six virtual machines three on each CPU
and then we'll leave a couple of cores
on each CPU for the for the hosts or
anything else that we want to run on
ungrate or whatever else so the idea
being that each system effectively has
64 gigs of dual-channel equivalent
memory bandwidth we're gonna switch over
to obtain drives I haven't done that
because I wasn't even sure if this was
gonna work those are just sitting on the
table we're gonna switch over to octane
drive so every system should have SSD
like performance even though we're
running three systems or rather six
across a raid zero of our raid 10 of
octane drives I mean do you guys want to
see us try and light up to more like or
are we done here I mean we've basically
we this is it this is proof of concept
now we're good I think I mean
can always run into issues but like I'm
pretty sure we're good but you want to
see us light up the other two I'll ask
Anthony Anthony what do they want they
haven't spoken okay cuz they could be
bored uh how many
25,000 people are watching this that's
cool all right cool
ha um well in the meantime until I hear
from you guys I guess what we're gonna
do is just start adding some more vm's
then so let's all right well I can't
finish the whole project today guys
we've got a whole like plan like we're
gonna have six cards in there they're
actually gonna be installed not hanging
out of these like testing PCI Express
riser and nonsense here massive shout
out to Thermaltake by the way for
sending us all these because it's really
hard to test six cards in a board unless
you're using a bunch of risers but
they're all gonna go in there nice and
clean it's gonna be hard line water
cools everything there's gonna be custom
fabrication going on on our case labs
case here rest in peace case labs like
we can't finish today but we can
certainly we can certainly get a lot
closer to full validation here so let's
go ahead and let's give this one did I
ha
we glitched out the GUI isn't that
fantastic look at this there's like
because it's three digits because we
have a hundred and eleven threads on
these two CPUs on Reed Lake doesn't know
what to do with it okay so I don't
actually know exactly how many course
I'm enabling here that's tremendous
so one two three four five six seven
eight nine theoretically that's that's
nine course here let's go ahead and give
it 64 gigs around the system has 384
gigs around by the way so every system
can have 64 gigs ish I think I might
have to tone it down a little bit yeah
what's 64 times 6 yeah no I'll have to
tell them down just a touch but for now
we can do that
ah OS install whatever so I did I think
theoretically throw a couple more images
on here so we won't have to wait around
for those to copy do you remember which
cards I used already Brendan I didn't
use the tight necks okay sorry I what
did I use already 1017 p5 okay so
definitely not tight next and then I
haven't used one of these as media
controllers yet those are gonna be a
little bit inconvenient because I can
only they have one type C port and I
don't know if I have a dongle on me but
let's just go ahead and fire it you know
I'll go grab a dongle I'll be right back
sorry one sec That moment when the host
just leaves a livestream with 25,000
people waiting like I'm wasted okay so
what is what is the math work out to for
that Anthony if I'm gone for 10 seconds
how many hours of people's time have I
wasted it feels like a lot of pressure
right now I'm gonna I don't even know if
I wanna know the number I wasted 69
hours sorry everyone
okay so ws3 is fired up oh I guess I
shut down WS too but I didn't really
need to well let's let's go see if it's
let's go see if it lit up over here
second oh wait no you know what I think
it just hasn't I think it just hasn't
refreshed and caught up here hello
let's hope up
oh did we crash the host dang it I knew
we were pushing her luck you still alive
there buddy come on everybody oh we
crashed the host oh I wonder if I
screwed up when I plugged in that type-c
thing hmm I don't know it's possible
that I like shorted something I don't
think I grounded myself on the case
first crap so just okay I don't
generally wear like a ESD strap but
generally if while you're if every time
you stop moving you just touch something
big and metal or ideally something
that's actually plugged into ground you
should be fine
should p.m. but I did not do that
hi everyone who sent a super ton
troubleshooting Blake Blake why oh cool
hi Blake banks I like the stream - Wow I
should okay but I do also really want to
get this working so that's the flip side
of that ah
let's okay let's let's open that okay
hold on before I do want to finish my
thought first okay so a good example of
something that you can touch to make
sure that you are actually grounded
would be the casing of a power supply
that is plugged in even if it is not
actually powered on the casing is
grounded to the ground plug of your
power of your of your power cord which
goes to the ground plug of your house
assuming you're not in one of those
places like Japan where they don't have
ground plugs for some reason and then
you are definitely grounded like you are
not leaving your room grounded okay
so yeah we boot it up in that mode again
so let's go ahead and do that okay oh
man now I really do feel like we're
pushing our luck here stressed just fix
that stupid nonsense really wasn't
dealing with that right now oh this is
exciting though I mean maybe you guys
are my good luck charm like maybe that's
what's going on here wait a minute
where's my vm's tab where is my vm's tab
why is a naval VM set to disable what
what just happened we just crashed hard
so hard oh my Wow Wow ws3 is gone okay
so you know what that's fine because
we're gonna take this opportunity to
make sure that everything is configured
correctly so WS one is going to be the P
5000 and the NEC controller cool ws 2 is
going to be the first renesis controller
and is going to be the no yeah the 1060
let's leave that the way that it is 1060
okay
ws 3 so let's try that again
ws 3 is gonna be this nonsense that you
got going on here so we heard it's three
three nine ten you know what let's just
call that good enough I mean if it's
gonna nuke our config if we crash again
then I guess this is all a waste of time
you know what let's just throw yeah
whatever I did fifty three gigs of
memory who cares okay
manual user domains ws3 there's that
boot disk
okay now let's throw the ten seventy on
that one and we're gonna do the second
Renaissance controller create that okay
then we are going to add a WS for
and we're gonna grab I don't know let's
just grab some CPU cores in here
somewhere
bla bla bla bla none of this really
matters that much right now well we'll
do everything properly later because you
got to make sure that you're not taking
cores across separate Numa nodes in that
kind of crap so these are all just copy
paste of ws1
so they're all just the same thing okay
so now this one gets the Titan X and it
gets one of the as Media's okay now
let's take it slow let's start up one
just patience I know I'm asking for a
lot of patience you guys have been very
patient already I think we've been at
this for like an hour
by the way Thank You Brandon you're a
superstar what what 2 euros to get me to
play Minecraft uh I played Minecraft
once actually I played it with my son we
were on the the Cano Cano PC thing and I
didn't really get it because I'm old
someday though someday I will learn
minecraft ok this one's up WSU's er
there we go beautiful now let's do ws2
this is gonna be my last attempt if we
crash when we launch ws3 I clearly have
some more complicated troubleshooting to
do there might be some hardware
instability or something like that like
I I have never actually heavily loaded
up this platform so I don't even know
how how primetime ready it is
there's ws2 ok I'm just gonna wait for
it to boot so so yeah I don't know what
caused that and there might be a little
bit more work to do stuff that would not
make sense to livestream the whole time
come on baby good ok so here's where we
crashed last time ws3 I wonder if it's
those as meteor controllers John from
unhurried did tell me they were junk oh
but he didn't tell me why so I don't
know if maybe
just unstable or they cause instability
or they maybe they're crappy with
pasture I don't know exactly what he was
talking about so it's hard for me to say
okay theoretically it started so we
should see it light up any second here
but I haven't actually checked the
inputs for that so let me just
double-check that real quick here we
never had it light up before right
Brennan okay oh so that's gtx 1070 which
is oh I haven't even tested this cable
before so that's theoretically going
into the type see the type C connection
on the back of the monitor here and I
think I did have that one set up but
that's weird
I haven't played around with type C
display inputs much theoretically it's
this top one but you know what we've
actually got another option I've pulled
in an extra HDMI cable just in case so
two only two of the HDMI inputs on this
monitor run at 60 Hertz but for testing
purposes doesn't really matter because I
just bumped my cards did it crash okay I
just like shouldered the daughterboard
because when we actually roll this out
for the finished video everyone's just
gonna have their own monitors anyway we
won't be using any display / type C or
anything like that so it won't matter
okay so this goes into 1070 so yeah I
don't even know if this cable works so
we want to eliminate as many variables
as we can here so that was HDMI in -
where did I put the remote input this
one what'd I say - 200 okay alright now
this might tell us if it's those as
media controllers that are bugging us up
because ws4 is the first one I'm trying
to launch here with one of those
controllers so that way that was the
Titan X right so the Titan X goes to
HDMI three I think so let's make sure
that's right HDMI one no I think it's
gonna take you to my three that's how we
look here oh that's a good sign there's
one CPU might pull this off ah you know
what I should do
I should check my my Network link speed
here give me one second I don't know if
I hooked up a 10 gig connection to this
port oh shoot I didn't so we're only
running at gigabit so what I was kind of
hoping was maybe I could even fire up
Adobe Premiere here and do like a quick
you know actual demo or something I
don't know maybe we can you think we
could sustain to over gigabit you've
seen the data rates on the network
connections while you're editing right I
think we could do too I mean we can try
okay
just can you look away while I sign in
to premiere I don't want people
hijacking my stupid Creative Cloud
account that would be very inconvenient
okay sign me out of the other computer
so I can sign in here yep fine
no no I'm not I'm not done yet sorry
Brendan you're going to timeout I'm
gonna stare at the wall hi
okay Thank You Anthony very helpful okay
we're ready to sign in ready okay
I wonder what Adobe's uh like login
servers think of the same user logging
in at exactly the same time on two
different machines from the same IP it's
like what is this guy doing like what
what is he doing
I can tell these VMs haven't crashed
from the cursors that are still blinking
but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna fool
around with those ones too much I don't
think yeah so apparently they didn't
think much of that because premier is
not launching over here till loading
okay
we went full her pa'dar oh wait
there we go that's looking pretty good
welcome to premier pro open a project
just go find something do you have
anything that you would suggest that we
try to open like what's something that
we're done but like barely sorry deep
spark oh yeah sure
okay deep spa project okay their project
I feel like we're not gonna leave a lot
of suspense in the finished video at
this point that I guess that's fine can
you think of another one I don't want to
open the scene the same one twice
bathroom that never smells flying PC
that's probably been offloaded hey no I
don't think it has for some reason okay
cool well someone bugged up but that's
good for us right now okay so we're
gonna need 10 gigabit Network for sure
in order to get decent performance out
of this whole setup but convert project
yeah sure whatever
yeah sure whatever I think s I'm running
a different version of premiere than you
guys missing some video filters offline
all
okay now normally you wouldn't do this
we want o no output devices available ah
no I don't we'll deal with audio devices
later because this is more than just
like you know gaming on multiple VMs on
a single box this is like actual
workstation use with enterprise grade
hardware this is cool stuff okay so here
we go let's it's generating peak file
for the that does take a while
I'll premiere Oh
premier yeah its template file structure
blah blah blah oh really I don't know if
we can wait that long unfortunately
okay well we might have to call it I
mean I can already see we're running
into a bottleneck this is hitting 650
megabit per second
this one's hitting 300 so right there
that's it that's our gigabit this is
holding us back already we need to go
ten gig maybe even to ten gig
connections teamed in order to make sure
that all six of them are able to like
real-time at it aka red footage so I
guess that's pretty much it then this
stream is brought to you guys by private
Internet access private innocent private
Internet access is the VPN with a bunch
of talking points so I don't remember
exactly what they are right now but
basically it's a VPN so it allows you to
hide your identity online allows you to
use online services as though you are in
a different country it allows you to
avoid tracking online if you don't like
people keeping an eye on what exactly it
is that you're doing on the Internet and
we're gonna have a link in the video
description once this goes up as an
archive where you can check out P ia I
don't actually remember what our vanity
URL is for it
so let's outro this then thanks for
watching guys if you disliked this video
then you know I'm sorry
I'm sorry you don't like fun but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description I don't know if you
guys are going to
by this stuff CPU 5-grand other CPU
5-grand
ran oh boy that's gonna be like six
grand worth of RAM graphics cards we got
a pile daughter board five grand by the
time you put all the connections and the
cables and everything in it so yeah not
really recommended but you can go check
you can go buy a t-shirt we'll have that
link below as well okay Anthony kill it
by the way thanks everyone for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
