no way welcome to the window where I
used to life I don't use any and two
computers I use one yeah I don't think
they're police on it I'm sorry I'm sorry
I hit the mic I hit the keyboard over
here I'm not good at using the computers
I'm just I'm trying to use the computers
that is basically the whole channel
hahaha little bit about yeah it's a
combination of things yeah we have a
great show for you guys today the best
show the pretty much the best show um
twitch opens up its money-making tools
to non partnered channels I don't know
about twitch but uh not all of them I
don't know if I'd open up my money
making tools to non partners if you know
what I mean Wow Wow
only in approved circumstances which is
what they're doing that's right you
still have to apply with a condom yeah
there's a rumor that Google is planning
to add a native ad blocker to Chrome
super sick also you can flash possibly
your Radeon rx 470 towards a 570 because
this seems to happen every time the
towards is weird
co-op Fox I changed it I included it cuz
I was like no and you can't flash
something toward I mean I could've
elevating rewards and it ends up being a
565 because it was on the way it was
almost bad in kleitman 569 yeah yeah
yeah cuz it coming god I Jack words with
the last name in there 569 yeah I'm
totally down that's what it should be
called anyways long as you're the other
way hahahaha oh that's for phone numbers
to confirm dota 2 player identity wow
that ranked match that's a big step
forward for the removal of anonymity
from online gaming and by step forward
to be clear I'm not I'm not going to say
I'm for or against the move I mean as a
step forward towards that particular end
goal we can discuss it more later first
you have to sit through the intro with
sound new revelation
Oh savage turkey artis you bastard yeah
[Laughter]
how you get some accounting yeah I
thought okay I saw the habanero one and
I was like last time it just lasted
forever anyways so I can just eat that
one and no one's really going to care
because it just burns everyone else out
now it's open yeah you know everybody
else stuck with the severy single other
person every single other person three
fair does this is the reason this is the
reason that we're pushing here
muhahahahahaha is a development project
okay if you were wondering why I ate
dad's jerky to kick me over the house
that's right
and you deserved it and you know it yeah
time to pay rent alright so let's go
ahead and why don't we jump right into
our first topic here let's let's have
some let's have some fun here let's get
right into twitch opening up its
money-making tools to non partner
channels so the original article here is
from TechCrunch and the funny thing
about this is it is right on the heels
of YouTube actually closing down access
to their ad generating money generating
tools from folks who aren't abiding by
end like an advertiser friendly sort of
unspoken content guideline yeah now I'm
not saying that this is an apples to
apples comparison by any stretch of the
imagination but if twitch was looking
for a good time to kind of you know open
up the floodgates and be my only two
creators that want to do it as a job
trying to be more creator friendly this
is a this is as good a time as any
there's some interesting things it's not
full partnership so if you're looking at
partners right now and being like oh yes
I'll be able to become that or my friend
will be able to come that or whatever
it's not quite the same you won't get
everything yeah why don't you start with
a rundown of that
it's that partners get your partner
partners yes our partners have you have
a subscription button which is like the
bread and butter of being a partner and
these guys will not get that a
subscription button is five dollars a
month and you get a chat badge so I'm
showing that your subscriber if you
subscribe for a really long time that
chat badge can get upgraded you get
special emojis in the chat all that kind
of fun stuff I think there's been some
like potential leak kind of stuff where
people are talking about how there might
be different tiers of subscriptions in
the future but who knows
then there's cheering with bits which
both of these tiers will be able to get
cheering with bits is like there's
always been donating to streamers this
is a way to donate to streamers through
the twitch platform instead of through
something that the streamer sets up it
shows up in the chat with a little
animated thing depending on how many
bits you actually donated and streamers
can tie it in to actually have it pop up
on the stream and play a sound
notification wherever you will get that
it's a virtual tipping they call it and
I believe yeah when you when you cheer
you get a chat badge that slowly
upgrades over time depending on how much
you've cheered I'm gonna be honest with
you I'm streaming on Twitch right now I
do not get that the to your thing yeah I
don't get it I don't get why it
incentivizes people to to like donate
more to like shiny things I know I don't
get it and like okay another one is if
you cheer and comment in the same line
you get the partner can have a thing
where that gets pinned to the top of the
chat the most recent cheer can get
pinned to the top of the chat so if you
want your comment to be seen by everyone
for sure in a chat with comments flying
by you add like a little bit of money to
it and get spin so everyone sees I don't
personally care about commenting on
twitch so it's not for me
I only comment patrol you on your stream
occasionally everything I'm not even
listening so I can't even respond okay
the only - the only time I have enough
time just sit and watch your step no
offence
hahaha maybe the only time that there
couldn't that there isn't
some things anything that's why I got me
is what I'm like rocking the baby to
sleep yes yeah and I'm just like yep it
is not important in what I'm doing right
now it happens quickly so you're muted
you're muted af yeah and I'm just like
well I'm in the chat scrolling and then
everyone freaks out and they're trying
to like communicate for both of us
so the chats are trying to talk for me
to you and then sort of like it that
gets really weird yeah well there's the
delay yeah so the guys days can be
really long yeah or not or not it exists
in almost at all yeah so it's really
confusing it's very weird um so so so
can people pin it so can people cheer
for us like here so I believe our we
partner we are partnered for sure that
we might not have that enabled okay and
that would be good oh because language
cheering I'm an idiot and I don't know
how the dashboard works basically but
well not the dashboard well there was
that one feature that you're like yeah
you're going to need to turn that on I'm
like and you're like I'll do it for you
well we also know how to hosting thing
enabled is that we yeah yeah yeah no
there's been - I don't the other one
life
I don't ever exactly where it is but
it's not dashboard hard on your sound
will be there are settings subscriber
only chat exclude custom to enable
cheering with bits any blue is faithful
so it's the same we have everything we
have royalty tax and service tax
disabled an interview what the heck is
that
we have subscriber only chat disabled we
have excluding subscribers from slow
mode disabled we have cheering with Fitz
disabled the custom cheer mode disabled
bits threshold settings disable chat
badge settings disabled restrict access
to archives disabled ad free for
subscribers is enabled heck yeah and our
affiliate options are disabled as well
as our earning revenue from game sales
you might want to turn the bits one on
we are clearly not doing this right we
must be the worst partnered twitch
streamers on the entire platform free
BET I think you're also supposed to stay
a minimum of three times a week that
clearly never had like we're even on
time let alone three times a week so
yeah maybe maybe not so like what people
should aspire to be okay
so this this just in we are not
what people should aspire to be more
adolescent extreme West don't stream for
as long don't stream Dane head hold up
it all the money-making stuff yeah allow
subscribers but like don't really worry
about giving them anything cool
apparently yeah and pre-record last week
swag show that's right I almost got the
lens that was actually um oh yeah you'll
have you'll have cheering with bits if
you get into the affiliate program I
believe there's also ads right you can
have advertisements on the channel those
are all give you some money but that is
very bro and then if you are planning to
livestream this week's LAN show make
sure you change your clock setting oh ah
see that see that changing the clock
settings for this clearly pre-recorded
show haha thanks livestream yeah I don't
get any weird issues with like the
computer not being able to do things on
the internet because the timecode is so
wrong and stuff because you're just
local recording that's right you just
set it back to normal and upload it
later no problem easy alright so anyway
in a nutshell this new tier will be
called affiliate yeah not um partners
okay it's a little cooler for partners
because partners get stuff like a
verified chat badge we haven't set them
apart when they go in other people's
chats and and it will still be on an
invitation basis so based on a number of
criteria including timespan stream oh
sorry I'm spent streaming viewership
numbers and follower account I think
those last two were pretty good right
yeah we're doing pretty okay okay yeah
alright it's an easier way to start kind
of getting your foot in the door because
right now the threshold for becoming a
partner is very hard to hit when the
discoverability of
which is platform being not a partner is
really really bad yeah right that's fair
like unless you're like the first person
streaming some hot new game and even
then you've got like an hour yeah you
really don't have that long yeah and you
need to be like exceptionally good at it
often yeah to really draw people in like
there's a few success stories where
someone gets like a weird early access
code so they get like a day of head of
everyone else so they're further in the
game than everyone so then they get a
bunch of your I hate or like a bunch of
servers goes down but the one they're
connected to is able to stay up so they
get a bunch of it like there's there's
weird ways if you wait and make it
accidentally promoting small fun
streamers since 2000 whatever it hasn't
been that long I've talked to you about
this and it's it's hard because with
with something like YouTube you get off
board it every about 5 10 minutes
because the video will end and it's
going to suggest a whole bunch of other
videos right so you'll get off work you
might continue purposefully going for
their videos but right it's making a
conscious decision over and over and
over again every 5 to 10 minutes with
twitch you click on one person and then
it tries to keep you there so it's it's
harder for them to try to spread their
users out and then if you want to go
find one of these little smaller
streamers you're going to be going to
some game and then you'll be like
scrolling through pages and pages of all
things that look the same yeah just like
thumbnails yeah of a game yeah cuz like
that's pretty much it that's going on
yeah cuz you can't put boobs in it
anymore so what do you have to do like I
can't I can't even like am I even
allowed to wear a low-cut I think that
yes this is okay you know I've shown it
known it known it so I could even I
could even like that's what's probably
fine that's probably fine too I think
mid-drift is also not allowed it's kind
of funny is it yours probably cool
depending on the compression this kind
of leg hair could even look kind of like
a shadowed between boob kind of cleavage
area what do you know why why did you
show it
giant pecs yeah giant backdoor knows
that's what's going on over here
giant giant weird ah ha ha we put the
loot in nude
yeah all right another news Google this
is rumored the original post on our
forum was by dead-eyed
psycho thank you for posting that Google
is rumored to be adding a native ad
blocker to Chrome can you even imagine
honestly after you read through this it
completely makes sense what they're
targeting is stuff like pop-up ads that
don't go away for a timer and that
autoplay videos Sheriff adds that
autoplay sound there they're only
targeting ad blocking for things that
they view as like kind of pain in
treatment yeah intrusive a damaging the
user experience this is coming back to
is it ad block plus I can never keep
track this is coming back there's so
many or whatever but the concept though
of a responsible yes
web ad yeah and white listing ads that
are non intrusive that's the idea then
so their thing is they're they're
blocking ads that are beneath a
threshold of user or consumer
acceptability mm-hmm you go to website
it's like oh my goodness this is
ridiculous hopefully they'll be blocking
it so tell me this what would this mean
for the effectiveness then of online
advertising because there's a reason
that obnoxious ads exist if they didn't
work they wouldn't exist nobody would
put them on their website so and and I
mean you've got some experience with
this yeah the obnoxious ads how much
more do they pay a lot more like to the
point where I actually don't know like I
don't remember the exact numbers because
this was a couple years ago where we had
this like fight
you did well no not you and me oh I see
cuz I was gonna say I don't I don't
think I was ever pushing you for like oh
I'm not okay to give a little bit of
context we're talking about the four
yeah particularly the tech kids calm
forum that's the only place where we
there's a recent a little bit of a
kerfuffle where
member of the team Colton added a bunch
of ads and like didn't put them in the
right spots and didn't enable the right
rules so like people that had paid to be
on the forum while not seeing ads we're
seeing ads and they were like everywhere
and in really obnoxious places and stuff
but I took care of that it's fine now
but there was a little bit of a
kerfuffle way back in the day when we
were kind of deciding how we want
everything to work and a partner that we
had that was like getting the ads for us
to put on the website was a little
distraught because they wanted to put
ads not just above the fold because we
have one ad that's above the fold on the
top right I don't think it's too
intrusive but they want to put it like
center middle top here why don't I log
in so you guys can see okay so here you
go you know I'm actually here I'm just
going to move us so um this spot right
here is what we call above the fold
which is above the first page break on a
website you can actually see we don't
even have anything on our section well
we don't have a lot of advertising on
our site is impatient we have water down
there okay there's no food or water but
there's but like why would anyone be
here down at the test post yeah
not oh wait probably not everyone can
see okay well anyway um okay well right
now we're logged into an account that I
think has access to stuff that not
everybody does but basically the
advertising partner wanted us to put one
of those ones here or above that I like
I like they're here yeah you know
they've wanted it specifically to go in
line with the logo up in the top part
and and they wanted it auto-playing
video not necessarily sound because they
agreed that was pretty intrusive but
like auto-playing video pop up stuff
like because those are the things that
make money if you make it like the top
middle of the page at the a bit more
money and like I think Colton put one
right in this air opes hold on at that
think Colton put one right in this area
yeah so I asked that pretty quick
there's one where if you go into a forum
section yeah it's if they're not logged
in who's the long post I am logged in
though if you're yeah I know but if
you're not logged in there's one that
goes in between these two posts
but if you are logged in it goes away
and right now it doesn't have it but
I'll put it there again and back in the
day it had this where it shows on each
side of that ad because just log in to
get rid of this ad right and the idea
was we just wanted more members yeah and
if you're if you're just checking out
like a troubleshooting post and you're
not going to come back like sure you can
never have enough members that could get
ridiculous pretty great that's it yeah
painful deliver ha ha ha ha well the
member itself not that painful as long
it upstairs each of them doesn't have a
ballsack probably okay yeah
has branched into this look though sorry
Brandon okay so in a nutshell there's
there some reasoning behind all this so
Google may choose to block all
advertising that appears on sites with
offending ads instead of the individual
offending ads themselves so Google is
like taking a stand against crappy
advertising because these kinds of ads
are what are pushing people to install
ad blocking software and 26 percent of
US users now employ ad blocking tools on
their desktops anyway yeah and this is I
mean this is estimated but if you're
Google and your whole business is
contextual advertising with the idea
behind it being that you are providing
an ad that has relevance to the user I
can see why you might be leveraging your
position as the number one browser to to
try to reverse that tide and try and try
and stop bleeding out the users that you
can show advertising to and there's that
that common quote that I don't know how
many people actually go with this but
there's a common quote that like if the
ads weren't so intrusive I wouldn't run
adblock yeah I personally think that's
kind of BS I most a lot of the time I'm
sure they're that I'm sure it's true for
some people I know one person in
particular that has it set to OFF for
all sites but then if it was like that
he can like barely view because of it
help specifically turn it on right okay
and I'm like okay that seems a little
bit more of
to me right but like whatever I
understand the concern there's it is
very annoying when you go to some sites
and it's just everywhere and unusable
one that I particularly really hate is
when you're on a news style website and
they have those news style ads that are
just all bullcrap
the a sponsored story I never I never
actually click on them but I often think
that it's real at first so I'll go read
them and then I'm like oh crap it's one
of those stupid things again no I just
that so it just it's it's distracting
and it's never going to make me click on
it because it's so obviously BS but
that's the thing is like they wouldn't
exist if comes from well there you go
clicking on them here we go so this is
what we're talking about it's like he
doesn't speak with his daughter anymore
after the incident and like it's
obviously can you yeah I don't know who
the chick is but she's probably some
well-known person too
it's like she had ideas about I think
that this one usually has an O in and I
think this is yeah how can you not even
copy paste and like it's it's there's
often lots of skin like it's there
there's like weird medical stuff is
always in there yet you can see at least
at least too early the secret will
destroy the diabetes industry try it
tonight
what watch this simple trick up like I
just I hate where yeah absolutely hate
this all right so yeah I would be very
done with that go ahead google run for
it I'll make sure the forums all good I
do wonder if they're going to make the
make it through the like you know the
regulatory bodies that exist I don't
know who exactly would be would be sort
of monitoring that I don't think it's a
problem because your browser interprets
the its anti-competitive if Google is
blocking other ad providers ads with
their browser that they control and
their an ad provider and they're not
blocking their own ads I mean they could
say no we're blocking our own ads
equally ours aren't obnoxious so they
don't fall within this criteria that was
determined by this third-party Coalition
for better
it's not our fault but that's got to
hold up in Crimea I'm sure Google has
like done is going to do their duty I
mean it's not like this is happening yet
it's not like this is even confirmed
very much a rumor I'm sure they'll do
their due diligence before they just
roll this out but I have some serious
doubts about whether or not this would
make it through the scrutiny of a legal
review and given the size of the
advertising industry the kinds of
damages that Google could potentially
have to pay for a move like this could
actually be enough to dissuade them like
they yes they have enough money to buy
the earth and all the heavens but it
could be significant enough to be an
issue yeah to do it this was originally
posted by filo one so for those of you
who were wondering if perhaps AMD did do
the retooling and refining of the
manufacturing on their RX 470 and 480
graphics cards that they said they did
in order to turn them into 570 and 580
graphics cards then I don't remember how
I started that sentence so I'm not sure
how to end it but for those of you that
actually believe yes um it may be that
they didn't do quite as much as they
said they did and the high power
consumption of the 570 and the 580 may
simply have to do with AMD binning for
high leakage high power chips and
cranking up the voltage so it is it
looks like the original article here is
from guru 3d there could it even maybe
been some retooling to help them get
larger bins of cards that they think
would fit under this yep yep and that's
that's very very possible and we may
probable as well but what it looks like
is that most of the board partners are
using the very same PCB design according
to Hilbert
they're that they used for the 400
series and since the device ID doesn't
appear to be changed just the subsystem
ID then there's the possibility that you
can flash the graphics card using a TI
tool or excuse me a TI flash so looks
like it can be achieved regardless of
CPU and yeah there you go I mean it's
not like this is the first time that yay
thank you
oh it's not like this is the first time
that AMD has run into this sort of thing
which really does kind of raise the
question did they did they not see this
coming it's not it wasn't even that long
to go maybe they don't care I think my
favorite one was 292 to 90s because it
was like literally sold as a different
product within the same time frame yeah
they've had other situation they taught
a lot fracturing radians goes all the
way back to like 9500 non-pro where they
reused the PCB design and memory layout
of the Radeon 9700 there you go and if
you had I believe it was the I shaped
memory config versus the lower cost with
lower clocked l-shaped memory config
then you could flash it to 9700 that
right you would probably know that
wouldn't you memory yes so so so Elvis
okay L was good or bad sorry so
apparently L was good i shaped was bad
anyway which kind of leads me to believe
then that they must just not care I mean
remember the 50 not 50/50 870 it might
even be good for them it just had a bio
switch on it yeah and they're just like
yeah there's like a normal BIOS in like
I'd needed whatever bio do whatever
you're going to do with that maybe they
just don't give a crap
it might legitimately be good for them
because this isn't it's very unlikely to
come across as bad news to people that
are very informed because they're just
me like oh sweet I can buy the older one
and they just do this crazy manual thing
and most people that aren't informed
aren't really going to care and they'll
buy whatever one
into their budget properly so the
hardcores will be like excited and
talking about their brand maybe this is
hi AMD ends up was kind of that
rebellion about that team that team red
kind of fanaticism where it's like they
just kind of leave stuff there for those
super hard course there five years built
on hope built on Easter eggs Easter eggs
and hope um where it's just like
realistically no one else is probably
even going to care about the small
performance difference between a 400
series and a 500 series and like the
actual risk I think a lot of companies
worry about this where they're like yeah
I mean realistically we don't care if
people were to flash the card but what
we're worried about is people screwing
it up and breaking the card yeah but I
think the the percentage of users who
are actually going to download a tool
like ati flash is so small that all you
really stand to gain is hardcore users
who are like super excited about it
doing it and talking about what a great
company you are and the people who don't
care just not doing it and just having
to listen to their friend yes yes okay
them yes the 480 is cheaper and better
you know what I just learned my game
just fine I can't be bothered with that
I'm just going to get a 580 I don't care
go away shut up I'll see you on I'll see
you on discord in 20 minutes yeah so now
there you have it okay now let's get
into our biggest topic of the day right
after these ads fresh books oh are you a
small business owner or freelancer
having trouble keeping track of things
like expenses and time logs on a given
job invoices that you've sent out to
your clients fresh books is all about
making that easy instead of having your
like accounting software on your
computer at night and you get home from
a long day of painting houses or
whatever it is and your arms are
legitimately started serious
no I know well because I yeah you do
enough thousands of reps of pretty much
anything
and you're gonna get a workout yeah um
and the training the ladders ain't bad
either I thought like okay not to do
that I think we're going up with a fiver
yeah which is five-gallon yeah yeah I've
gotta learn about carrying a five-gallon
bucket ladder that even is like fill it
with almost anything and that's gonna be
a no yeah but alone it like a dense
liquid yeah um but but anyway so the
point is freshbooks lets you take your
accounting with you and makes it simple
enough that anyone can do it you just
take pictures of your invoices and log
them you log your hours so you can make
sure you're sending out your bills
properly you invoice in less than 30
seconds you send a nice
professional-looking invoice and the
client pays on your terms so you can
take deposits you can actually have them
pay through the platform so you can get
paid faster yeah and this is really cool
you can see yeah when the client has
seen the invoice and put an end to that
oh did you send it yet sir I didn't get
it hey um you know I don't my checkbook
um you know what forget your checkbook
well don't forget your cheque but
remember your checkbook and pay me
because I know you saw it or pay with
their little module thing yeah or that
they have a reader as well yeah so check
it out at fresh books.com slash win try
it out you get a 30-day free trial and
now we're get yes yes now we're getting
into the savage savage jerky which is
the one that I really like the rock
couple actually the last time I ate the
reaper on stream and just like died so
that was a level 5 of hot they showed
their like heat level at the bottom
which i think is super cool down good
level 4 I've got a 2 I'm going for the
maple buffalo bacon waffle ooh big these
guys actually this is really funny so
you know how they sponsor just like a
bazillion years ago yeah and then they
just went like radio silence on us yeah
so it turns out that wasn't because they
hate us that was just like a shipping
logistical issue so yeah they don't hate
us it's all good which is good because I
was like hey Colton did we get any more
samples of that jerky and he was
lighting everything they said oh so bad
I know
so maple maple buffalo bacon
wait is that a 5 screw to the 4 okay we
have a 5
No we have the Carolina Reaper that's
what I ate last time I like died and we
also have the ghost pepper
did you try ghost pepper yet oh we
caught it okay I want to try the Mojo
habanero okay let's see how you do with
that I'm calm are you good with spicy
stuff to you I just really like the
maple one so I'm eating that first okay
have you tried the maple buffalo bacon I
have not just really good it's not that
hot hmm you might not get the full
effect if you've already eaten a really
spicy one recently I can clear it up
yeah you got a silent really this is
like the same consistency as milk it
works
you disgust me in every way ha ha what's
wrong with you everything we're gonna
wash down ha ha ha turkey bacon lips
some swollen everything is wrong with
that paper okay so the mojo have now
this is an order the 3 3 plate
oh no it's gonna work for you okay okay
so yeah that's the two is like oh no no
the Reaper is 5 that does go all the way
behind it adds another Bowl adds another
bar over the rest of the packages okay
so it ghost peppers are for okay okay so
see if you can handle the ghost pepper
then folder so is this one this one this
one's with me this can't be that bad
because the maple buffalo bacon is a 2
and that's really not that hot I don't
carry that many feet from the make this
stuff is like so covered in like spices
and like alright habanero it's spicy
it's not too bad put its place
no it's spicy but it's nice yeah beef
lime juice water girl there's a little
bit of kick Oh
it takes a sec
you can taste the citrus though it has
lime juice orange juice and lemon juice
Oh how's it going that's nice though
it's really good it tastes really good
yeah Cayenne whatever have an arrow
pepper I see jerky is you'll eat it a
little bit slower yeah otherwise like
enjoy the package a little bit it's easy
to like destroy an entire bag of jerky
yeah okay well what do you think of what
you think of the maple one I liked it
but I like the I like the beef ones more
personally well I'll just keep this then
yeah I love being the host because like
olt who's been keeping everyone else
away from this stuff with a stick for
the last week and you've been seaming it
basically for us to sit on stream and
eat it that good good pretty spicy
though cool oh I don't think I'm
completely dying like with the Reaper I
never tried the crack suffering sea salt
one so I'm going to just eat Whoopie
ones for the rest of the show but they
add it guys savage jerky well I call it
a little wrong there uh-huh yeah inhaled
a little wrong trust me you don't want
hot jerky down your windpipe that's bad
anyway savage jerky dot-com use offer
code ltte to save 10% lots of different
flavors and it's a it's good stuff Ninh
so this one the ghost pepper one is like
a good top of my tolerance level spice I
think yak like I had one I'm good for a
while I'm okay I'm processing it
everything's fine until the reapers are
elves too much I'm actually usually
pretty good with that yeah yeah I've
never had that problem that's far more
detail about your bodily functions than
I ever cared to know but I guess I kind
of invited don't I we shared it with
everyone
yeah on the stream that's uh that's the
way we do it live and archived all right
so Val this is a huge move originally
posted on ARS technica let's go ahead
and get that are you sure this has
already happened with csgo
just to add to that valve asks for phone
numbers to confirm dota 2 player
identities and the idea is that this
move would cut down on expert players
intentionally smurfing noobs and if
you're not familiar with the term
smurfing then get off twitch because you
suck and I'm kidding because I know a
lot of people are here for our tech show
and not necessarily regular twitch
viewers so smurfing refers to creating a
separate dummy dummy profile that is a
very low level so you can just like kind
of fit with your jackass friends and be
look look God doesn't know how to play
this game as well as me because I've
logged like 800 hours so like I'm not on
a new account now I want to do a cow and
I'm just going to like kick as Oz's is
so great so I think the ghost over one
sorry to go back hits you a little bit
later yeah well my salivary glands are
like firing trying to like cool
everything down nice it's uh yeah I
don't know these are maybe like for me
at least like one strip every like wide
while thankfully they are resealable
packages anyway yeah so the idea is you
have to have an attached phone number
this should cut down on Smurfs like you
were just talking about but also
cheaters because if your phone number is
used and then you are banned
I believe you cannot reuse that phone
number for three months three months oh
so phone numbers can't be passed between
accounts without a three month waiting
period yeah so it should reduce cheaters
as well so if you can queue up with only
people that have verified numbers mm-hmm
that means you'll have less cheaters and
less Smurfs which makes a way better
competitive experience this I'm like
fairly certain this is already encounter
so I guess I should have just checked
chat valve statement here players using
multiple accounts create a negative
matchmaking experience at all skill
brackets so our goal is to add just
enough friction to this process that the
number of players doing this will be
noticeably reduced
having more players using their primary
accounts will have a positive effect on
both ranked and unranked matchmaking
yeah so it's already called CS co-prime
you have a prime enabled account if
you've attached your phone number and
that has made a significant positive
improvement in the csgo community so
they're spreading it over to Rivet - you
had an interesting mention I haven't
actually heard anyone bring up the fact
that it reduces anonymity in gaming it
does until you said that but that is
true and that's something that a lot of
people are really feel very strongly
should be preserved but that's a
viewpoint that I've personally argued
against in the past I mean as but okay
and all of this comes you have to
understand take it with a dumptruck
worth of salt because this comes from my
perspective as someone who has willingly
forfeited basically all of my online
privacy by being a web via video
personality yeah so I look at I look at
it and I go well for me though the ways
in which I could behave like a complete
ass hat online are pretty limited
because if anyone figured out it was me
I actually there are people out there
who know who I am I have a reputation to
uphold anonymity means you don't have a
reputation to uphold
it could be the nicest person one day
and the crappiest person the other day
and there's basically no consequences
and there's arguments to be made the
other way like anonymity lets you you
know truly speak your mind in a way that
you couldn't but there are a lot of
people particularly in the gaming
community that quite frankly I don't
think should be allowed to speak their
mind um
I'm letting him go I disagree I'm just
saying but I'm letting him go to get his
point across so my so basically I think
that anonymity is the same as not having
any accountability and for myself I've
personally made the choice to forfeit my
anonymity and I would love to be able to
reap the benefit of interacting with
other people online who have
willingly forfeited their anonymity so
that's what I like about this move from
valve they're not forcing everybody to
do it yeah they're just saying if you
willingly give up that anonymity and you
are willing to tie your personal actual
you to an actual avatar in a one-to-one
relationship then you get the benefit of
interacting only with other people who
are also willing to do the same and I
think that's a great move
I'm cool with that concept at this level
where the anonymity loss is not public
but just to the okay it lessens out see
that's that's where some of it loses me
to because I want to give a phone number
to just anybody um that that becomes an
issue even with valve and these big
companies like what they do with data is
so sketchy we have a topic in here that
we'll probably talk about later where
Bo's has apparently been stealing
people's data in terms of like what
music and podcasts and stuff they've
been listening to on their wireless
headphones which is like what the hell
guys and apparently they have very
definitely been selling it which is just
like so garbo but we'll talk about that
later I'm real I so like I do not like
giving forward my information but at the
same time if it's something fairly
minimal I don't really use my actual
calling feature on my phone much anymore
and if someone calls me and it's not a
number that's already in my phone I
pretty much don't pick up right and like
phone services and stuff now auto
detects certain numbers so like if my
ISP calls me it will tell me their
company name yeah so they show up if
it's a super random number I just don't
pick it up so I'm not that worried about
that leaking I personally think this is
a cool system when CS co-prime came out
I jumped on that as soon as I could
which right because I I thought that was
cool I don't like losing my own enmity
outwards to people that are playing the
game sure I hate that concept I hated so
much when YouTube was supposed to be
like real names right that was stupid
I hated that that was a dumb idea
and I think the Internet agreed with me
but losing a little bit just so that you
can get rid of all to like
just terrible people not all of them but
a lot of the terrible people is pretty
cool especially when like could you
attach I wonder if you could attach like
a Skype number that I don't know or
something that isn't like your real
phone yeah that's something I haven't
really tried I mean I mean obviously
there's the whole other issue of like
basically like burner numbers being very
very inexpensive yes but but you'd have
to go out and do something that's good
enough for me in my opinion yep and it
like this is a convenience yeah if you
reduce the convenient because like I
would rather go out and get a burner
number or go get a Skype number or
something I don't know if that works
don't even know if that's possible but
go do something that takes a couple
steps so that it would increase the
barrier of like Oh in 20 seconds I could
just be trolling a bunch of people and
gabi a giant jerk well okay now maybe
you have to go to the store and buy a
pay-as-you-go phone or something
yeah like that that takes more steps you
have to absolutely like leave your house
and go deliberately do something the
amount of people that will actually do
that it's pretty low and that I would be
very happy
comics aber asks why no s-8 review oh
it's coming I filmed it today yeah
basically we didn't get one early so
there's that all right we did we pick
fun of the note too much or like no
actually well there I just I had so much
to say about it that it was already
going to be like an 11 minute video
without pre-roll and integration no I
mean like the reason why we didn't get
it early oh no no we've just that are
our Samsung contacts it's it's a it's a
complicated thing we're probably getting
too far into like the boring business of
being a youtuber right now but basically
we are physically located in Canada but
the majority of our audience is in the
US so so for a lot of big companies the
u.s. division can't talk to us because
we are on Canadian soil and the Canadian
division only wants to talk about stupid
Canadian things
I feel like we really like when this
phone is launching on Bell I don't care
when it's launching on Bell
I want to know when the hardware is
available so I'll get these deep and
press releases like you know three weeks
from now that are like oh can you
believe this phone's coming to Rogers
and tell us I'm like a review units
available right what am I supposed to
say about it at this point thanks for
nothing
so we should just like incorporate in
Delaware ah and get like a get like a
100 square foot one-bedroom apartment in
like nowhere land what what is this ah
oh I thought it was something but you're
gonna like get the hammer and attack me
no I mean this is exciting
um what is that what does that mean
paint me scared but excited or something
like that I don't member it is but
whatever um but yeah like I almost it's
a pretty big issue being in Canada yeah
companies even when I like tell them
we're in Canada and they're like oh yeah
we can have our like Canadian contact
reach out to you I'm like please no
please don't do that no like oh no it's
fine I'm like it is not fine
it is not fine at all nothing about this
is fine yeah um speaking of things that
are fine we've got some fine videos up
on floatplane Club right now yeah so you
guys have been hard at work on some
pretty crazy stuff is there anything
that's not totally behind the scenes
that we can talk about I mean there's
the call for coders there's the fact
that we basically don't know what the
platform is I was just going to say uh
yeah I guess I can address some of the
comments on this yeah that would be cool
people have questions in twitch chat and
I see them through the blur of twitch
chat I will try to respond to them a lot
of comments on mainly the YouTube side
not this side we're just very odd our
cameras gone by the way we're just very
very odd like people people being like
oh yeah building a different version of
YouTube is a terrible idea
and I'm
yes it is yeah that would be a terrible
idea that's not what we're doing
did you know I would invest exactly zero
dollars in that idea yeah that's that's
horrible
people that think I'm like asking for a
lot I am definitely asking for a lot but
they're like oh my god one person can't
build this platform on their own like I
know that's why I included this section
about how they're going to have to
collaborate with all of the other people
that are working on the project No so so
many mr. violence is about to turn into
a is about to turn into a rant isn't it
a little bit I'm holding back I'm
looking for questions in the chat all
right I'll talk about some of the some
of the videos we have coming up so we've
got the tiny laptop tested someone's
asking if I did hair implants lately no
we did a bunch of really cool testing on
that that super tiny GPD pocket laptop
including running games on it itself
using game stream it's got a great
really sharp 1080p IPS display really
cool little device so we've got our
video up for that we've got the first
build guide in over a year the thousand
dollar gaming build guide with
pyrotechnics that is real fire you
haven't seen this have you no that is
that is most is that when you just I
think I gave you the can for that no
it's it's definitely one completely my
manager move of include what no no the
computer is on fire in this video don't
worry about ok so there's something
maybe get Alex to work on this I've
wanted to do this since scrappy doors
for I wanted to work with rod on this
but it's like it isn't really working
out I want to look into fire cooling
fire cooling using fire to pull the air
through the chassis okay
I could be that buyer would consent it
so you use it to pull through yeah so
get some big heat sinks yeah okay get a
fire going okay fire cooling I like it
yeah I like it cool something with heat
so other things that we have on there
right now we have the worst CPU cooler
ever
sketchy heatsinks episode 2 oh man
that thing really is abominable I will
point be open to other Creators
underwater microphone for GoPro wow
that's an amazing picture not for a
while
yeah not photoshopped very relocated
dolphins adult dolphins their photo sure
did you do that we have the RGB Ram
roundup they were school and I think now
we're caught up to - what's up on you
RGB rare roundup yep it definitely is
2017 he had dogs all right so why don't
you address some of the questions that
people have about Lee a lot of its going
really fast and I haven't really
actually seen a toggle oh okay
how is hopefully supposed to be
different the video confuse me so if you
remember vessel back in the day there
was an idea where a video would show up
on vessel one week before it showed up
on YouTube and there were exceptions to
this like LAN show or anything that was
extremely timely if a new product just
came out it would show up on both
platforms at the same time etc etc etc
floatplane is going to accomplish that
and and hopefully much more it should
have different tiers the quality should
be better well it will hopefully soon
have its own platform which we are very
actively working on gets on the website
yeah not just a sub forum on Linus tech
tips comm which is like the Anglian
works but it is pretty janky yeah and so
yeah it will have other tiers that
people can subscribe at which will have
other things that having our own kind of
CDN things set up will enable us to give
to the people that are contributing the
biggest difference I think from in terms
of what we think will make it a success
business-wise is that instead of being a
burden on the creator instead of being a
contract that a creator signs and
commits to like a one week early access
window that you know they are
contractually obligated to uphold that
could potentially hurt their ability to
get the best discoverability on YouTube
that's the strength of YouTube
discoverability and reach a broader
audience
we're not looking to damage that so for
us the way that creators would use
floatplane club would be up to them yeah
so if they wanted to go like a more
roosterteeth type route and say okay we
want a for our early access window sure
then we'd kind of go okay then go ahead
and do that you know whatever whatever
your subscribers are down for we think
is totally cool we just want to build
the platform for them and allow them to
use it as they will and part of the the
like mentality behind the whole time has
been not trying to force people to stay
there so we're going to try to have a
very transparent
we've always I think I like to think
we've always been really transparent
Atlantis Media Group we've literally
have a series called honest answers or
we explain like we're all going on your
question how do we make money now you
get review samples like things people
really want to know and we want to be
transparent not only to users with open
club but also to creators we're not
going to have weird shadow algorithm
changes that like screw with everybody
we're going to be very open about how we
use people data we're not going to tell
people's data etc etcetera etcetera
so yeah the idea is the idea is pretty
simple we Vessel shut down on us pretty
much overnight and we went wow thank
goodness we are smart and talented
enough mostly what's sitting in that
chair to replace this functionality for
ourselves what about other people who
were successful with a tool like vessel
and who would want something like that
in the future or we're interested what
are they going to use or who are just
interested what about why is it that you
have to be a giant sort of mega
publisher like college humor or escapist
magazine or roosterteeth that can afford
to develop your own platform in order to
move viewers off platform where the
Creator can make a lot more purview and
deliver additional benefits to the
viewer why do you have to be a mega
publisher in order to achieve them we
don't think you should have to be so
that's the idea we're building something
that we were going to build anyway for
ourselves because we have that
capability now and then we're taking it
eight steps further to make it
accessible to other people yeah that's
floatplane club so people can use it
like you were talking earlier however
they want they can set up whatever tiers
they want maybe they have a 14-year
exclusivity window that would be a
pretty bad way to use the platform I
think personally but they can do that if
they want we like our one-week model it
works for us in terms of like a pacing
of how we work on videos someone the
chat asks do flow playing videos ever
hit YouTube yes all of them yep that is
definitely the idea sometimes the window
ends up being longer than a week because
timely videos go in the slot that it's
supposed to go in and it gets bumped
back and weird things happen but they
always eventually hit YouTube and I
don't think we actually have a great
example of that so see this the RX 570
and 580 review that went up
simultaneously yeah and for that reason
going back further the red weapon
unboxing is not up on YouTube yet even
though it was posted on floatplane Club
on April 13th yeah so something like a
red epic unboxing those written weapon
unboxing is awesome I think it's super
cool I'm excited to define a time
sensitive yeah it's not a new camera
it's an equally relevant piece of
content two weeks from now three weeks
from now quite frankly and a large
percentage of people you guys are
watching away and show you so you guys
have probably heard about flow claim
before but a fairly large percentage of
people when vessel died thought we just
didn't have that anymore
right and didn't notice anything changed
because nothing changed nothing changes
you still get the exact same amount of
videos mm-hmm
they're just also somewhere else a
little bit early so if you're not
interested in full plane don't worry
about it enjoy your life have a happy
day yeah but if you want to see some
stuff in a place that honestly has
better comments and does have a guest
can't can't just comment section I'll
say yeah
yeah and that drives us to engage with
it more - which is oh there's more
comments from internal staff on there
and like better bit rates and most
scenarios because it's variable okay I
tried to ask this question a handful of
times would you guys ever get people
like team four star I have no idea what
that is yeah do you know what that is
not
okay and how would you handle the MCA so
dmca we would handle it the same way
we're required to by law yeah
as for creators I'm assuming they're
like edgy or something so at least for
the foreseeable future creators would be
on an invitation-only basis ah because
it opens us up to a lot of liability to
be hosting video content from our site
we would have to make sure that it's
people that we trust so you would expect
the initial roster to be people who we
know personally yeah and that's about it
a big part of that is we don't want to
grow too fast and break the prop or
something I'm not one-on-one asking
would we be able to make an exclusive
series for floatplane club like nerd
sports was on vessel yes we would do
nothing to prevent a creator from
uploading exclusive content and using
float playing club as so you can
understand what the creator page is
going to look like it's going to look
like your page slope lane club takes
only like the sliver down the left and I
think the top banner yeah everything
else is branded the Creator and unless
the person browsing that page actively
follows other creators we don't plan to
have a ton of discoverability tools
included no the idea is that a creator
would be able to direct their viewer to
their page engage one on one and not
have to worry about any BS that happens
in between that so whatever it is that
they want to deliver we want them to
have the ability to upload it manage it
the way that they want and deliver a
really high-quality viewing experience
and because the platform will be paid
every view will be paid for at some
point so people that are subscribed to
us on floatplane club right now are
paying 3 bucks a month we can afford to
do that and I've had people point out to
me well YouTube could flip a switch and
double their bit rates I disagree in
fact I think that because of their scale
they're actually less likely to do that
if it were to cost YouTube a fraction of
a cent more to deliver each view that
would actually add up to something real
yeah whereas if it costs us a fraction
of a cent more to increase the bitrate
of every beat what do we care yeah yeah
it's a very interesting experience and
like like he said with the maybe stuff
that doesn't go on YouTube or whatever a
creator can do that we don't have any
plans to do that but a creator could do
that if they wanted actually I thought
about it but just like cell phone
footage okay not like real videos well
that that would be maybe where like we'd
have like an additional feed yeah
because there's like there's a I'm not
going to go way too into it right now
but the like the other section which one
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so it
could just go in like a different area
watch the mic pick that up anyways um
people asking what about YouTube red
yeah what about it so YouTube red is
site wide and includes google play music
great product we think people should
subscribe to YouTube bread it
dramatically increases the per view like
the per view earnings for the creators
that you love you know and there's
absolutely no reason not to continue to
enjoy YouTube red I mean for us really
we want to challenge creators to come up
with different and new ways to make
floatplane Club worthwhile for their
viewers so you know we'd love to we're
also not going to be the like developers
developers developers where we're just
going to put it completely in their
hands we'll have some like guidelines
and suggestions of how they can do stuff
yeah so the idea would be like you know
on YouTube bread it's pretty
straightforward you subscribe to youtube
bread you don't see ads that's it that's
all there is to it what if you had other
ideas what if you had ideas like you
wanted a subscriber only chat for the
first half an hour what if you had ideas
like you wanted people to have custom
emojis you know things that are
available on other platforms like
Twitter but not on YouTube what if you
had ideas like you wanted to have a
mailing list like a newsletter or
something you're going to do that to
youtube bread know so it's it's a tool
box that's the idea yeah
okay well I don't want the whole stream
to end up being about this although I
will say that we're not losing viewers
people are apparently pretty interested
in it bottom let's go ahead let's move
on to some of the other stuff that's
going on the original article hears from
CNBC Nintendo's Ness mini
apparently the rumor is allegedly
Nintendo was discontinuing the Ness mini
in order to make room for the Ness mini
which will rumor Glee be ready for the
end of the year I love this sub headline
here the smash had popular games
including Super Mario World and Donkey
Kong Country really the sniff had
popular you have got to be kidding me no
way apparently some Ness classic
consoles are on you day for as much as 5
grand that's stupid
anyway um ok yeah that's pretty
straightforward
I basically covered everything that was
so the noose Ness will also have
plug-and-play setup and an array of
games would come pre-installed and ready
to play
ok well like maybe some random dude put
one up for 5 grand that no one's buying
because there's other ones that are not
$5,000 they look like two to three
hundred dollars on average which is a
lot but it's not 5 grand a little blown
out of proportion
cosplay goes bad for a gamer in Grand
Prairie or goes really really well I
have an alternative take on this go for
it though um basically the guy was
walking around the street with wearing
what looked like a bomb on his back he
was dressed as a character from Fallout
wearing a gas mask helmet armor and
bullet belt carrying a flag that's a new
California Republic
so first up you're an idiot so there's
that a little bit at least eight
officers responded with their long guns
drawn yes we do have guns in Canada and
yes if you walk around looking like
you're loaded for bear we actually have
you will get them pulled onto you who
per cap
Canada has a lot of guns yeah like a
huge amount compared to most countries
he was observed going into a Linz
alterations because he wanted some
alterations made to the costume through
conversation with the man police were
able to determine that he was wearing a
costume and that there was no threat to
the public what had looked like a bomb
turned out to be several chip cans that
were painted silver the man was taken
into custody but later released without
any charges and probably a stern
talking-to about being a complete idiot
so I think this is fantastic for the guy
like one of the best things that could
have happened to him reason being uh-huh
a lot of cosplayers going to get
sponsored I'm settling in here he made a
cosplay costume that was good enough to
fool the police to get guns drawn on him
to get him pulled in okay so I'm gonna
stop you right there and say you're as
much of an idiot as haha I see because
the maja you were there when we were
doing the first channel secret okay yeah
on the bug I saw a bright yellow gun did
narrow bottoms on you to a bright yellow
gun that fires salt tickle flies they
thought if you officers they have to
respond if someone reports you someone
with a gun yeah so it was an idiot
neighbor it could have been any idiot
the police had to respond but there was
eight of them that a drew gun okay
that's fair if I remember correctly they
just walked up casually and we're like
okay no Dobby don't walk around not
winging it around cuz like your
neighbors are great they thought it was
cool yeah they tried it yeah yeah they
were actually pretty cool cops like they
were they didn't draw guns it's a little
bit different so this guy can take this
and go like look my cosplay so good it
fooled eight different cops they drew
guns on me it's impressive
bring me your convention pay me and make
a cosplay thing I'm there it should be
the best thing that's ever happened to
his career terrible man claims this is
from Ars Technica calm his Bose
headphones intercept what he's listening
to an Illinois man says my headphones
transmit audio metadata to data miners
segment dot IO why would they be doing
this brutal it's a claim the civil
complaint alleges that those collects
the names of any music and audio tracks
played through the headphones along with
the customers personally identifiable
serial number
it also says this information gets sent
to third parties including data miner
segment I o Moses lawyers likely will
argue that while it may be sending out
copies of the metadata artist song title
etc its actions do not constitute
contents of any wire or or oral or
electronic communication as defined
under the relevant wiretap law therefore
it could argue that they are not liable
the counterpoint is that those products
interacts with consumer smartphones
which transmit operational instructions
regarding skipping and rewinding audio
tracks which would be content holy crap
what's the hell man super lame don't
like it at all I guess it's not enough
to get to $2.99 that someone like no
wonder Wireless is there like 399 there
really sorry they're really expensive
you already got $400 for a bomb cost
that has got to be less than $100 we
need someone else to make really good
active noise-cancelling headphones
sennheiser dixie 550 is available liked
the i tried both of them the bose ones
were way more comfortable they are more
comfortable you just said really good
you didn't say really more comfortable
really good isn't over they sound really
good they sound better yeah
yeah I'm just saying which Isis found in
this potential I didn't say that I just
that I like to the Bose Comfort more
because I wear Sennheiser headphones and
I prefer some hazard sound signature and
I'm very used to how most n eyes or
headphones sit on your head and Heiser's
audiophile line the HD line has a
different feel that I wish they would
just abandon all their other fields and
just stick with yeah but it's not very
it's no recordable
it's not very portable it doesn't look
very good yeah so I get it but yeah yeah
uh Microsoft is doing its own Chromebook
thing it's kind of weird that's pretty
cool so our original article here is
from TechCrunch so it's supposed to be
one of those like a Jew cloud kind of
devices it's very targeted at education
stuff because it's supposed to be either
spin effective no pictures of it like
you just said but yeah low-end laptop
cloud-based services all-day battery
quad-core intel celeron processors
shouldn't be that bad I mean quad core
so it's probably going to lose because
it's Microsoft's cloud services versus
anything Wow
you're as savage as this jerky Oh
seriously though that's mean I mean um
was it wrong what's it called SkyDrive
or onedrive now I can't even keep track
anymore
I think onedrive ones wrong this is that
bad I hate it you upload the file you
don't like it now like here yeah all
right sounds weird Oh Apple yeah Apple
whole home water cooling heating you
ruining my buzz right you're just you're
harshing it um Apple originally posted
by PC world will return heat generated
by the data center to warm up homes so
this is being done in Denmark this is a
new data center that's focused on
returning to the community so it's uh
it'll be fully powered by renewable
energy part of it coming from recycling
waste products from farms and won't put
stress on the local grid and they're
making a major push to be one of the
greenest companies on the planet um the
new corporate headquarters that I wonder
how much it costs in building materials
and how much that all harms the earth to
solve it from wherever they got it
anyway at one point their new corporate
headquarters called Apple Park will run
on renewable energy
they've also cut their use of toxic
materials and are using more recycled
materials and products and packaging
pretty epic all right
I got that's pretty much it you well

through all right mojo habit I love to
maple bacon
I like the mojo habanero the ghost
pepper one when I pulled this out was
when I could have had another ghost ever
what if I really wanted to but it's like
it's like just slightly outside of my
like comfortable tolerance level the
Mojo habanero is like right in where

flavor 5% uncomfortable but that was the
one with the citrus right I think so not
