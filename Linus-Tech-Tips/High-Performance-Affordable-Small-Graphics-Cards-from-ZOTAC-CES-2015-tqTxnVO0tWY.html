brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom glass for the best darn
screen protectors out there as well as
hyperx alright guys welcome to the zotac
sweep will be checking out three
graphics cards over here but the first
two will be the 970 amp extreme core
edition and the 970 amp omegac or
addition both of these graphics cards
are going to be faster by about 20 to 30
megahertz they're going to have about
the same cooling and temperature
performance and there'll be a little bit
slimmer so the previous editions were
about like two and a half three slot so
you can really sli them very well the
new ones will be exactly two slots so
you'll be fine the amp extreme core
edition will have a twelve twenty eight
megahertz base clock at thirteen eighty
megahertz boost clock four gigabytes of
gddr5 and a 7200 memory clock so a
little bit faster but not that much of a
difference and also the 970 amp Omega
core edition 11 1152 megahertz base a 13
yo form a Hertz boost and 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 and a 7 10 megahertz memory clock
so not only will you be getting the same
or more performance in terms of cooling
and raw graphics output performance but
you'll be getting it in a smaller
package which is more versatile and a
more affordable graphics card overall
last but not least is kind of a short
and stubby 970 with a rear exhaust
designed cooler with a single fan it's
going to be able to fit nicely in very
small builds and they're wondering what
the interest for this graphics card is
so in the comments down below and maybe
on their Twitter or my Twitter let us
know what you think about this form
factor for 970 alright guys if you want
