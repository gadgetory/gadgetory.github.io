science bias lighting halo 6 LED kit
this allows you to backlight your
monitor for continuous comfortable
viewing it reduces eye fatigue enhances
color definition and increases viewing
hours okay it has also been found that
with these LED backlighting things for
your monitors you can reduce your eye
fatigue enhance color definition and
increase your own oh hold on I'm reading
the wrong C I'm looking at a cheat sheet
over there and I read through the ones
that were already here so uh him bring
out colors more clearly dark and blacks
and increase the perceived contrast
ratio so let's see what they have to say
for themselves makes it easy to outfit
your monitor with professional
backlighting bias lighting that adds a
subtle white backlight to your monitor
reducing that fatigue and increasing
perceived image clarity the color and
brightness of the leds are carefully
calibrated to achieve the optimal
viewing experience increase your
monitors perceived contrast ratio so
that's on there making blacks blacker
and colors more vibrant simply attach
the LED strip to the back of your
monitor and insert the USB plug in an
open USB port on your computer or
powered USB hub the sound science halo 6
LED bias lighting kit complements any
monitor up to 24 inches in size well
then let's unbox this bad boy done now
let's install it okay here we go
so this is a 24 inch monitor which is
apparently it is good for up to 24 inch
mom'll go ahead and I'm gonna plug this
in to the USB port three USB port yes ha
now we have LEDs cool beans okay we also
have some protective film on the front
go ahead pull that off okay and then we
have adhesive backing on the back so
what you want to do is find a spot on
the back of the monitor where it will
reflect off the wall and give the back
wall behind the monitor some glow halo
effect around it this is what and this
is not just sound science saying this
this is not what rather it's not just
sound science saying this but the light
behind the monitor is what helps to
achieve the enhanced comfort and
decreased fatigue which are sort of both
the same thing that can be achieved by
using these products I'm gonna put it
sort of approximately in the middle of
the monitor as middle as I can get and
I'm gonna stick it there then I'm going
to turn the lights down a little bit in
here because we've gotten we have it
everything I want doing my filming
lights over there so that it's very very
bright in here so I'll just get my so
now you can get a better idea of and
more like a normal lighting scenario how
much of a backlight below it's gonna
throw off the back of the monitor okay
let me just move this one so you can see
along the side there now I haven't
actually tried using one of these
products in the past but I am gonna try
this one at all um I'll try and remember
to post some kind of an update and let
you guys know but thank you for checking
out my unboxing of these sound science
bias lighting don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from on boxing's
reviews and other computer videos and
hey if you want to check out what it
looks like installed on the back of the
monitor that is how it goes
slick informs me that it was kind of
hard to see how much
there was because I was changing the
lighting in the room and then I was
turning on the bias lighting so here I'm
showing you guys on and off on and off
don't forget to subscribe for more on
and off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
