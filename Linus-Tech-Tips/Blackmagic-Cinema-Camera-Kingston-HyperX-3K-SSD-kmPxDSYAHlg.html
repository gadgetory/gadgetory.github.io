gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more the Blackmagic Cinema
Camera our new camera by the way very
excited has been on the market long
enough now that I'm not going to spend a
bunch of time talking about the specs
other than a few key ones here it has a
two and a half K sensor intended to be
down scaled to deliver sharper than
normal 1080p or 2k it's got 13 stops of
dynamic range which basically amounts to
less detail lost in the highlights and
lowlights and it can shoot in
uncompressed cinema DNG RAW avid dnxhd
and Apple ProRes vs. AVC HD which is
what we're stuck with on our fs700
unless we use an external recorder it
includes a key for DaVinci Resolve which
is otherwise a thousand-dollar piece of
software which is pretty darn cool and
it comes in a very pretty box which
won't matter one fish is nipple to most
people but I like boxes so there you go
they're great at box design now they're
great at other things too black magics
design philosophy is a little bit
different from other companies they
emphasize building what we can versus
what the market will be willing to buy
for a given price and they emphasize
open standards rather than closed
proprietary vil ones in fact one of the
most notable things about this camera
for me is a great example of that and
that's the use of two and a half inch PC
SSDs for recording standard computer
SSDs are probably one of the only
relatively inexpensive mediums that is
capable of delivering strong enough
performance to handle the massive 150
megabytes per second data rate required
by 12 bit raw tuna 1/2 K recording while
other recording solutions sometimes do
use two and a half inch SSDs convergent
design is one of them most other
companies choose to use firmware to lock
down recording media to proprietary
drives which deliver consistent
performance sure but are much more
expensive Blackmagic takes an open
approach and allows you to use whatever
SSD you want which when you consider
that a 250
gig drive holds only about 30 minutes of
raw footage is pretty nice but this open
approach has some drawbacks for them and
allowing customer to put drugs within
adequate performance in the camera will
lead to drop frames in the footage and a
bad customer experience for which
Blackmagic could easily be blamed which
leads us nicely into the second part of
this video which is both I guess a
feature for Kingston HyperX 3k SSD and a
bit of a public service announcement
now Kingston was kind enough to send us
over 3 480 gig drives for our recording
needs this will let us shoot about 3
hours of uncompressed raw footage
without offloading to a PC which is
great and in exchange all they wanted
was for us to talk about why their SSD
is great for use with this camera which
is easy because it's right on black
magics validated drive list so there you
go yay moving on no seriously I should
probably give some background as to why
it's on there
hyper X 3 K drives deliver great
performance in this use case because
they use real-time data compression to
take the large files that you produce
while filming and to turn them into
something smaller on the fly before
committing them to the flash chips on
the SSD this is actually similar to how
other video compression standards like
h.264 work except for one major
difference when you read the data back
off of a hyper X 3 K Drive it
decompresses it on the fly again
delivering the full quality file to you
without you ever noticing that it was
stored in a compressed form this
technology is perfect here because
uncompressed raw footage is right in the
wheelhouse of SandForce controller-based
SSD drives allowing them to perform
pretty near optimally and of course
they're just standard PC SSDs so the
same tech works in your computer as well
on the back we find a 5-inch 800 by 480
capacitive touchscreen that can be used
for camera settings playback and review
a metadata entry and it's large size is
actually another example of black magics
because we can attitude truthfully a
5-inch display doesn't cost much more
than a three inch display so they put it
on way to be
with that said the BMCC isn't perfect
the on-screen controls are not as
granular or as fast to adjust as our
main camera the sony fs7 hundred with
its deeper settings and reprogrammable
hardware buttons but considering that I
could buy three black magics and the
lens for each for the price of a single
fs700 and the lens and it delivers
better image quality out of the box it's
pretty darn compelling although the FS
does have slow-mo built-in ND filters
and with the firmware upgrade in a
third-party recorder pulls ahead and
image quality and can record in 4k so
just something to bear in mind last
things to show on the camera are of
course mounts on the top for any
accessories you might have straps on the
right hand side oh yeah that s SD slot
where you go ahead and pop a 2 to 1/2
inch SSD in there for your recording
needs on the bottom we've got
ventilation yes it is actively cooled
there's actually a fan inside this bad
boy and then last but not least is the
record button up there on the front that
I never actually mentioned now to close
out this video we're undoubtedly there
are many folks who didn't make it this
far in and left comments underneath
wondering why we could possibly need
this camera for unboxings I'll leave
some footage here from some of the
projects that we've done that aren't
unboxings where it would have been nice
to have a B camera or a little bit more
control in post-production than the
stock AVC HD recording of the fs700
allows so we do do other things than
unboxings and we will put this camera to
good use and I think that's pretty much
it guys we're really excited about
having it like this video if you liked
it dislike it if you just liked it leave
a comment and let me know you know
something
tell me what kind of fish is your
favorite to eat and then as always guys
