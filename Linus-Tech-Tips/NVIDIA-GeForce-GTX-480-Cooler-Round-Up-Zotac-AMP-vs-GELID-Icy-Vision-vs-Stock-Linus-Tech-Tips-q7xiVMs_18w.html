test comparing the stock geforce gtx 480
to the zotac and perdition geforce gtx
480 to a geforce gtx 480 with the gelid
IC vision so you can see these two
coolers are quite similar both triple
slog coolers whereas the stock cooler is
a dual slot cooler that blows the
exhaust still at the back of the case
both of these are going to exhaust air
into the case so while this isn't a
perfect test because i am using an open
test bench as opposed to a closed case
where these two would be at a
disadvantage it's still going to give us
a little bit of an idea so you can see i
am running furmark in extreme burn mode
right now I am running at 87 degrees
Celsius so I've got msi afterburner
running in the background there 87
degrees Celsius fans beat a seventy-nine
percent so I'm going to let you listen
to the fan it's quite loud a little bit
on the obnoxious side my room
temperature is 27 degrees Celsius right
now so at a 727 we're going to take that
to be a 60-degree delta so delta means
the difference between the ambient
temperature and the temperature of the
GPU and that's at a hundred percent load
at seventy-nine percent fan speed so
next we're going to run the B amp
edition and then we're going to run the
IC vision and see how they compare in
terms of noise and in terms of the Delta
oh I should probably mention the
overclock I'm running at right after
burner I'm running at one point 0 7 5
volts and then I'm running at 8 50 +
2200 on the core and memory respectively
fan speed is set to auto at all times
well here's the zotac amp addition I
have to say right off the bat I'm very
very impressed because we're running out
the same overclock here okay so you can
see here all the settings are the same
we're running the same burn test and we
are hitting a maximum of 72 degrees on
the GPU but that's not really
interesting part because that's not a
whole lot lower our room temperature
right now is 26 so ah it's going to make
me do math so that's about 46 I hope
2622 whatever i'm going to guess 46 and
then i'll double check my math later so
it's a 46 degree delta at here's the
kicker forty-seven percent fans need
some forty seven percent so let's say we
go ahead and kick the fan speed up I'm
sure we can achieve dramatically better
temperatures like let's say let's put
this fan up around eighty percent which
is where the other one was and I bet
even at eighty percent it won't be
nearly as loud i'll actually hold on no
no no wait ah we gotta go back to auto
gotta go back to auto ok so we're back
to forty-five percent ok so i'll let you
listen to the fan basically you can't
even hear it it's super quiet so if we
go and ramp it up to a fan speed that's
more like what the other one was at
which even at eighty percent it's still
not nearly as loud as the stock cooler
at eighty percent
then I think we're going to see really
really low GPU temperature so I'll come
back once that stabilizes you can see my
room's heating up a little bit now we're
at about 30 degrees in the room but so
even more impressively than it would be
if we were still at the same temperature
we're seeing 64 degrees on the GPU
that's very consistent so that's at
eighty percent fan speed we're not even
going as as fast as we possibly could so
that's only a 34 degree Delta at eighty
percent on the zotac amp edition card so
that's very very impressive running at
the same overclock setting so what that
means is you can either have more
overclocking Headroom on on an amp
edition card so you can turn your GPU
voltages up higher or it means you can
run at the same settings you could on a
stock card but you can do it very very
quietly now there is the disadvantage
that you can't install as many expansion
cards in your system because you can see
it's quite a bit thicker than I a
regular card so it takes up one extra
slot but you could still put an
additional video card right here and you
can still run SLI even in this
motherboard which is just a p55 board it
just has the right spacing as long as
you got three slots facing you can even
run sli with two amp addition cards well
the I see visions temperatures and fan
speeds have finally stabilized a little
bit i'm not i mean okay if i was
upgrading from the stock cooler i'd be
absolutely thrilled with the results but
based on the fact that i'm running this
compared to the zotac amp edition card
i'm not quite as impressed we stabilize
around 80 degrees on the GPU and then
get that to focus and at about fifty
seven percent on the fan speed but it's
the fan noise that's kind of bothering
me here because even at lower fan speed
i find it has a bit of a pulsating
pulsating sound to it when it's in a
closed case it's probably not going to
bother you but it's one of the things
that I do notice when it's on the test
bench so here I'll just let you listen
to it
I'm not sure if you can hear that or not
but anyway so 80 degrees and my room is
actually a little bit cooler now whoops
oh that's bad I'm trying to turn on my
my thermometer here I went and moved my
probe I'm trying to keep it in front of
the fan and take without jamming up the
fan which is what I just managed to do
there we go so basically i want the the
temperature of the air that's going into
the fan so 80 degrees minus about okay
looks like it's about 27 degrees in here
so that's 50 a delta of 53 so that's a
little bit worse so 53 degrees at
fifty-eight percent on the fan so I'm
going to go ahead and turn it up to sort
of a more comparable eighty percent and
then we'll see what it settles on in
terms of temperatures well very
interesting that appears to be as high
as the fan speed on the icy vision goes
so you can see I've turned it up even to
a hundred percent now it sounds exactly
the same and it's cooling exactly the
same rooms about a degree warmer now and
it's at 82 degrees so that's all sort of
well within margin of error so it looks
like that's as fast as the fans on the
icy vision run I mean it has the
advantage of being compatible with a lot
of different GPUs but I'd say overall in
the gtx 480 if you're looking at an
option of either buying a stock card and
then throwing an icy vision on it versus
just buying a nap edition card in the
first place it comes to about the same
price so i think the recommendation at
this point should be fairly clear i just
want to explain these results a little
bit better so remember this is not the
temperature of the GPU this is the Delta
so that means that's the difference in
temperature between room temp and the
temperature of your graphics card so a
delta of 60 degrees means that if your
room was 40 degrees your GPU would be
100 degrees if the Delta is 34 it means
that if your room is 34 degrees for
example
sort of a more realistic room
temperature although quite warm even in
the summer 34 degrees then your GP would
be at 78 degrees or if it was at 40 it
would be at 84 degrees so you see how
what I mean they're so this is a delta
this is not an absolute temperature so
these two are for the amp this is for
stock and this is for the IC vision okay
hopefully that's all pretty
self-explanatory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
