replaced the LG 65 eg 9600 65 inch
curved OLED 4k TV in my living room with
LG's brand-new Signature Series OLED 65
G 6p thanks LG BT Dubbs the birthday
cake was cool but this is better
now last time around I was blown away by
the massive improvements to image
quality compared to my old 1080p LCD
that were made possible by the switch to
OLED pixels and four times as many of
them at that but have we reached the
point of diminishing returns or is the
2016 flagship another quantum leap
forward thanks to the industry's next
big buzzword HDR let's discuss
Coursera boasts unrivaled comfort and
universal compatibility on its void
surround headset featuring a genuine
Dolby 7.1 headphone USB adapter check
out the link in the video description to
learn more the g6 as I'll be calling it
for the rest of the review because it's
fly is gorgeous in ways that I've always
been able to appreciate like the way the
organic light-emitting diodes the O LEDs
are so close to the surface of their
glass backing that they almost seem to
be floating they're dramatically
improving resistance to glare and
viewing angles to new ways I mean it's
funny how your perspective changes over
time there was a point in my life
not long ago mind you that a display a
monitor or a TV was all about the panel
it could be in a cardboard box housing
for all I cared
as long as the image quality was the
best that I could get for as few dollars
as possible and yet now that I'm older I
find it a easier to appreciate the value
of a beautifully designed enclosure for
my TV because I view it as a piece of
furniture as much as a window to my
Netflix fix and be easier to justify the
price increase that comes with better
industrial design because of how much
the piece is surrounding it managed to
cost without having a TV inside them and
people judge you if your stuff sucks
being an adult is kind of a bummer
unless you've had the sexiest toys on
the block though right the first thing I
was blown away by with the g6 was it
thinness feels like we're saying this
every year doesn't it but this time it's
different the protective piece of
cardboard in the box is almost the same
thickness as the entire display assembly
at least that is until you get down to
the somewhat blocky integrated sound bar
power supply and video input box stand
thing at the bottom I mean let's face it
putting all that stuff down there then
calling your display 2.5 7 millimeters
thick is a bit of a hack isn't it though
this does raise the question
do I care if they hack whether it's
Samsung's 1connect or LG's bulky power
input base everyone is pulling stuff out
of the TV now because it no longer
physically fits in order for them to hit
new fitness targets but I just don't
care but if I don't care about that and
likely neither do you did I care about
the rest of it being thinner in the
first place what kind of TV could they
make if they didn't stress out about
that I'll probably never know so I'll
just have to live with LG's approach
which isn't terrible since they did a
lot of things right including using
their hack to have the integrated Harman
Kardon co-branded speaker bar fired
directly at the listener instead of
downward the next thing they did right
is the image quality I still lack an HDR
capable pattern generator to measure
this stuff exactly so for now all I can
really do is put it in the words of my
wife with whom I did blind a B testing
between an SDR and an HDR master of
Sony's camping demo clip my first
instinct is this one looks better
referring to the HDR one it feels like I
can see more detail even though the
scene seems darker the colors look
almost more vibrant and that's HDR in a
nutshell it took me a while to wrap my
brain around this but it doesn't
manifest so much as a difference in
color as it does as a difference in
contrast that makes a dark scene with
bright lights for example look less
washed out because it's not trying to
cram everything into this narrower
contrast and color space it's more about
how it feels more natural and more true
to what it would be like if you were if
you were sitting there though taking
advantage of this requires that the
content is mastered in HDR at all then
beyond that that it's mastered in HDR in
a way that you the viewer will find
pleasing I was really struggling with my
comparison between my old set
and the new one watching Marco Polo on
Netflix colors skies landscapes skin
tones were all clearly better on the g6
but I had to crank the OLED brightness
even in the bright HDR preset to make
out any details in the shadows at all
well I don't know if it was the g6
firmware update or the Netflix app
update but instead of just saying HDR in
the top corner partway through my time
with the TV it started telling me if it
was HDR 10 or the competing Dolby vision
standard the g6 supports both and the
Netflix app doesn't allow you to
manually choose so watching HDR 10 only
content like LG's chess demo
side-by-side the superiority of the
newer display is obvious in the
reflections off the King's armor and the
glistening off all this Chinese stuff
which means then that I just don't seem
to like the Dolby vision Master of Marco
Polo as much as the HDR 10:1 that was
the problem
thankfully unlike most manufacturers LG
at least supports both of those
standards but I would like to see them
take it one step further and allow me to
set a preferred one and/or switch
between them at will because other than
that the thing looks amazing
which doesn't mean that they didn't do
anything wrong
the first one is a relatively minor one
but at what the actual F moment for sure
the power cord is permanently attached I
mean I guess anyone who can afford an
$8,000 TV can also afford a $5 extension
cord but come on and the second one is
much bigger LG and other TV makers too
need to wake up to gaming there simply
isn't any excuse anymore I don't expect
anyone to give a rat's ass about the
half dozen people other than me that are
running gaming PC's in their living
rooms but in three years since it
launched the PlayStation 4 has sold over
40 million consoles stop ignoring this
maybe if everyone complains they'll deal
with it next year that's apparently why
the curved screen is gone by the way
and the g6 follows directly in the
footsteps of its predecessor astonishing
image quality to the point where
anything else just kind of looks net but
if it appears that a conscious decision
has been made by LG to say screw it to
input leg in favor of concentrating
almost entirely on image quality then
it's because that's exactly what
happened even in game mode it's slow so
the bottom line then is the g6 as a
fascinating product the onboard
processor is tangibly faster that same
air mouse magic remote interface that I
really like is still here LG's software
isn't Android TV but it has a plex app
and a Netflix app which is pretty much
all that I really need and while oled
burnin continues to be a concern to the
point where LG's interface even has an
image quality restore routine that takes
an hour to run my year-old panel with
adequate care continues to behave well
which leaves us with the bottom line
would I pay $8,000 for this TV no the
law of diminishing returns hits pretty
hard once you've crossed over into OLED
territory at all but would I say it's
the best viewing experience I've ever
had if you simply don't care about money
and you're willing to compromise on
gaming then yes yes I would which isn't
to say that you always have to fork out
a ton of money to get the best
experience I'm of talking of course
