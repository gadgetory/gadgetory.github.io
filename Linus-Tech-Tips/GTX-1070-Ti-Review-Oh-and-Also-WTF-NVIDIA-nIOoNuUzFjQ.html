that for the holiday season and the
foreseeable future
I think Pascal is just unbeatable we
assumed he meant on the very high end
where AMD hasn't even teased an upcoming
competitor but I guess he probably
already knew then that the gtx 1070 TI
was on its way but what is this an
exciting new offering or just a
transparent attempt by Nvidia to get all
the press including us talking about
them by repackaging existing tech to
secure their market share while Vega
availability is low so we're going to
show you some performance numbers but
only after we talked about the BS that
NVIDIA is pulling with this launch and
after you listen to this word from our
sponsor Mac Weldon Mac Weldon believes
in smart design premium fabrics and

looking at the spec sheet gtx 1070 TI
has more in common with the 1080 than it
does with the 1070 it has the same core
clock the same TDP just a touch fewer
CUDA cores and in fact all it has in
common with the 1070 is the name and
memory configuration even visually it's
almost identical to a GTX 1080 founders
Edition same cooler same shroud same
overall length and width same power
connector I mean for all intents and
purposes this card feels more like a
Bend 1080 with cheaper gddr5 rather than
gddr5 X memory and given how quickly
it's been brought to market by the look
of things it probably is but just
because the product is a familiar face
with a mustache and a funny wig doesn't
mean the business practices are anything
we've seen before so in the past
founders editions were more expensive
presumably to avoid competing with bore
partners that are building custom
solutions like a soos EVGA and MSI but
this time the MSRP s are the same now
there's nothing legally ethically wrong
with this but it's known in the biz as a
dick move and while consumers might not
care about that
I mean lower prices is better right this
next one is a similar grade kick in
their teeth do you guys remember
greenlight and videos program limiting
overclocking friendly partner designs
with unlocked voltages well they are
tightening their fist even further board
partners are apparently now being told
that they can no longer sell cards with
a factory overclocked BIOS installed
Nvidia I'm sure you know this already
but this is a big load of bullshit I
mean look at poor EVGA 's website
everything from a bass blower card to a
water-cooled
card ships with exactly the same clock
speeds and the rumor going around from
even reputable sources like PC purse
Brian Shrout is that not only as every
card clocked the same out of the box
relying on GPU boost for any performance
gains and from my understanding these
vendors aren't even allowed to bend the
parts right so the higher end cards
don't get the best GPUs necessarily it's
kind of more luck at the draw here what
I mean what it feels like is they're
trying to keep this card from being too
good so that they can keep selling 1080s
some partners are trying to work around
this by bundling one-click overclocking
software but at worst this screws over
the users of platforms without available
software overclocking tools like Mac
users with external GPU boxes and at
best it's just adding more junk for the
consumer to install to get the
performance that they paid for whatever
your reasons for doing this Green Team
they're not good enough and we don't
like them with all that out of the way
the world does still need to know how
this card performs though so we grabbed
our KB Lake and rise and test benches
along with a fine selection of recent
GPUs to pin it against so is it good
enough to crush AMD's hopes and dreams
we start out with a solid it depends on
Rison we got slightly better performance
with Vega and Deus Ex mankind divided in
both 1080p and 1440p while our KB Lake
bench gave us more mixed results rise of
the Tomb Raider flips things around with
the 1070 TI pulling out ahead on both
Verizon and core i7 that is until we
look at DirectX 12 &amp;amp; 1440p where once
again the gap closes significantly and
Vega even overtakes it this trend
continues all the way through our bench
suite with the Vega 56 either pretty
close to 1070 TI and for honor and Ghost
Recon wildlands or outright
outperforming it like at 1440p in
Counter Strike global Offensive our
synthetics are initially more kind to
the 1070 TI with a higher result in
firestrike extreme and time spy but
uniden superposition gives the edge to
Vega 56 as for productivity blender
cycles renderer shows a clear preference
for AMD with Vega 56 shaving 15 seconds
off the 1070 TI's time to render the BMW
and an even wider gap in the classroom
test as for power consumption it clearly
favors the 1070 Ti though with a cool 30
watt lower total system power draw than
Vega 56 and an even wider gap of course
compared to Vega 64 unsurprisingly it's
pretty close to the GTX 1080 though it's
thermal performance under synthetic load
actually winds up a little better
so is it a Vega killer well that's where
it gets interesting
based on supposing MSRP s no but when we
consider vega's ongoing availability and
pricing issues it actually doesn't do
too badly at all not badly for Nvidia
that is both consumers and invidious
partners are kind of getting the shaft
here speaking of getting the shaft the
last thing you want is to be using an
air ports free Wi-Fi network or you know
doing some emergency banking at that
random cafe and be giving away your
personal information
well tunnel bear can solve this problem
it's the simple VPN app that makes it
easy to browse privately and enjoy a
more open Internet with tunnel bear
turned on a couple of things happen
number one your Wi-Fi connection gets
secured with AES 256-bit encryption and
number two your online activity is kept
private from your internet provider
advertisers or anyone else looking to
track you or profit from your data
because it switches your IP to one from
some other country you just pick it and
boom so start a seven day free trial at
tunnel bear comm /l TT and go check it
out at the link in the video description
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
our sponsor which has other cool shirts
and our community forum which you should
