use a 20-amp and our wall outlets are
just the normal 15 amp these are
adapters we're almost done putting the
new workbench together each of you are
gonna build your own desk okay
of course there's RMI series power
supplies feature premium components for
great performance with very low noise
click on the link in the video
description to learn more we are
installing our UPS is also known as
uninterruptible power supplies so these
were sent to us by General Electric I
didn't even know that they made that so
we are going on we've actually already
got one in if you look up there we've
got one of our UPS is in and so this one
is responsible for our this server and
that networking gear and then each of
these bottom three that we're installing
now is going to be responsible for one
of our storage servers and the reason
that I have one each is that we can tell
the UPS to tell the system to shut down
in the event of an AC power loss so that
it can shut down correctly Oh rather
than just having the power pull on it
how many more uh this one and then one
one more left so we got one two three
four desks up no we got more up desks oh
I just take away to subway today yeah
I'm hooking up all the ethernet jacks in
the test bench room oh I just want to
blow this out and then again no this is
a different one oh yeah
do it chinese-food by there's no
microwave here so I eat the code nothing
less there bub yeah I'm watching a funny
video configuring the switches
fascinating so it was love a good um not
quite next like Keira about arrived yes
hate Aaron do you want to build a robot
yes I do want to do that you're probably
good at sticking small things into
places can you help me out here forget
that that's pretty funny
we can't shave it at shave it down
because it because anything it's keeping
the heatsink on is that really the only
PCI slot you've got this is just
cardboard zine
yeah well I just removed the screw from
the one right above it Joey that's a
good window oh let's screw this in the
way hey my helmet has a light on it it's
very useful okay it should be in our you
add ha no you're not it huh you know I'm
of course covered in dust hey guys
welcome back it's me Nikki be a game
we're going to be putting together a
desk today we've already got the legs on
we've got the motor secured and you know
we're just going to dive right into
doing cable management alright so what
you got to do take the side off the
double sided tape though that's the way
you don't need that no one put this on
find a nice spot for the middle would
you look at that gorgeous absolutely
beautiful wonderful what do you think
about this desk now Dennis speechless
that's what I'm telling you this thing
is beautiful to work of us mine own I
can't even paint a picture that's
beautiful alright so doing this in there
and that throw you throw you drill down
and that's it folks that's all we got
here that's a that's how you build a
desk
Nikki V out okay so what I'm doing right
now is I'm configuring our switches here
with link aggregation so that is to say
I'm bonding together multiple interface
is in order to get higher speeds between
our two switches here so I'm actually
going to be aggregating these two and
then probably B's - between these two
switches so that's 20 gigabit total then
I'm aggregating these two - Wanek server
remember this is the high speed SSD
server with the 24 Kingston SSDs so we
want 20 gigabit to that now I know that
no single client will be able to hold 20
gigabit because I'm using LACP but
that's fine because we don't have any
clients that are 20 gigabit but we might
have multiple 10 gigabit clients that
are hitting it so I'm basically bonding
these ones bonding these ones in bonding
these ones so that there's essentially a
superhighway between anything plugged
into this and Wanek and anything plugged
into this and Wanek so to answer the
question of more moving blogs as I've
seen Wow doorknob I don't know is the
key that's what it was yeah my tweet was
quick question are you guys down for a
few more moving vlogs and it has 119
favorites so people do want more moving
blocks oh yeah keeping going late in the
day we released a video yeah there are
actually a couple of them
that's hilarious like I was kind of
dismayed that there was no living vlog
on Nestle this morning tech videos yeah
this is a view of setting up tech that
you're not going to get anywhere else
that's true alright like it's not it's
not a tutorial but you get to see the
kind of monster
so we have to go through to get the
stuff all working I look at this
nonsense
yeah this is this is reality this is the
real reality television flowers is
non-player yeah so there we go so
there's my direct-attached copper sfp+
cables I hope it doesn't matter that
those are different lengths it should be
fine and then I'm setting up that
bondage within the switch admin console
right now we started to clean the fridge
because all the shelving was really
gross
there was like mold ich coming going on
the edges that's nice and reasonably
clean this door makes that door open
instead of just so instead of just
opening one door you can open both doors
with one door Tom Wanek is up here good
develop oh good today's video yeah frog
on you sexy beast remember that time
that - and I went to the carnival now
actually down doesn't look like we have
very much it appears to happen that
video doesn't lie video is always true
right Taryn what what so Fraser server
here is finally getting its final config
unfortunately for a time pulling out the
Titan X he doesn't get that but I am
putting in to Titan blacks so we've
determined that ultimately we've ended
up with Adobe Media encoder for our for
our Cinna form transcoding and all that
stuff so we'll be using Adobe Media
encoder with the CPU for that but we'll
be using DaVinci Resolve for denoising
so we're going to go ahead we're going
to throw to tighten blacks in here now
unfortunately the only place to obtain
tighten blacks is ah
from the editing workstations the old
editing workstations because these are
going to be replaced by Titan X's which
means that I actually have to pull these
blocks off put air coolers back on them
and yeah so this is going to take me a
little bit and then I'm also changing
out the power supply this was this was
generously contributed by one of our
viewers this is a zippe 800 watt
redundant power supply so we're going to
throw that puppy in there as well then
this server is good to go so we are
going to build Mac's anomic scares nice
you get Smiley's
oh yeah that's mine is yours yeah
crossing off this is what I thank you
goodbye Estella stabilities okay
wait why is only one that's so strange
it comes with one of the line and then
you have to put the other one separate
so I'm going to start just putting the
chair together and guessing I mostly
know I lucky again as I'm real good at
not using instructions Brendon you're
not making this part really right it's
my pops up my process of building this
chair so in the race to build chairs
it looks like dennis is in the lead and
renege you know you haven't really even
started
so Harvey told Brandon funny you can do
this on his own about the instructions
and when I got over here this back seat
wasn't even on the chair
I'm here to mum I'm halfway done
yours is orange worse the way worse
cause it's orange in the one minute that
I've been here I've made more progress
on the chair then Brandon has in the
last 15 why are you helping me because
his is almost done you need to use this
Brendon I know yeah you have to pull
that I'm done
Wow Brendan look at bandits haha he's
going to sit down the floor for a while
look at that oh this is good
so comfortable this actually make you
want to sleep this is too comfortable to
work doing you like dentists this is so
scary
okay one Titan black extracted four to
go
start by removing the CPU blocks yes
that is how we take out a graphics card
in a Linus water-cooled system it's got
a DVI cable still plugged into it like
who moves their system like that and
yeah exactly one person ever Brandon
so now we are going to drain this sucker
that my friends is some gunky water
check this out so you can see the debris
that's been clogging up the blocks now
this is interesting so if i hook this up
so if i hook this up not only does the
water drain very slowly if we come down
here and look at the CPU block see how
slowly that's draining even if I blow on
the tube I can barely get the flow going
that's how gunked-up the blocks are what
kind of help huh you oh okay what color
is that that plastics supposed to be
that is supposed to be clear and if you
look carefully you can see that it is
still clear in places I use a compressor
I don't know if it did that work
whoa the pressure that's built up here
actually takes a while to leak out Wow
so now we've got to remove the block and
this my friends is why I always say keep
your stock cooler and screws all
together and preferably with the screws
actually screwed into the locations
almost all cooler where they go because
if you ever need to remove a block from
a card you are going to be super
thankful that you have that cooler
screws this side don't like it when this
happens
half the thermal pads come off a little
but it's okay it's not a big deal
because you can just kind of put them
back on the locations where they go now
we got to clean off our thermal compound
reapply and then we're good to go okay
so our two Titan blacks are installed
we've got our X 540 t2 Nick over here we
have our Thunderbolt card so that
actually plugs into one of our graphics
cards via DisplayPort so we'll be able
to connect our new card reader via
Thunderbolt directly to this system so
all that's left is to throw this puppy
back in here basically I need to just
kind of put this fan in place it's not
going to have any reason to shift and I
don't want to drill any holes right now
so I figured hey hot glue hot gluing is
always a good idea oh dang it
there oh whatever that's not really
gonna go anywhere I guess what a nice
video this was today and you know what
that makes me think of Squarespace taco
