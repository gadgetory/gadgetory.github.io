case man if anyone actually remembers
where that reference is from in one of
my previous NCIX tech tips episodes then
you get three gold stars of approval or
disapproval I'm not really sure because
that was terrible that was one of the
most shameful NCIX
tech tips moments of all time the camera
man tried to talk me out of it but he
did not succeed this is my unboxing of
the level 10 GT so the first thing we're
going to see on here is ahem
driving inspiration this is the snow
edition featuring internal USB 3.0
SuperSpeed so internal means it uses the
internal headers not those goofy around
the back reaching through the case
coming up behind the back of the i/o
shield and plugging in ones all right we
have some specs here so front speed 2
USB 3 SuperSpeed pitstop 5 ez swap hard
drive bays triple max ready for extra
long graphics cards even up to 36
centimeters which is quite long let me
tell you
quad fan maximum ventilation cooling
guessing it has four fans triple color
shift adjustable fan ambient colors neat
cable clear advanced cable management
SSS smart lock security system and cool
flux liquid cooling already this is a
very slick looking case if the pictures
are anything to go by why don't we go
ahead and get it out of the box and then
we will see if it looks as good in
person as it does in photos so the first
thing we find is a very very thick
packing foam so we've got about an inch
of foam around the case itself and then
an additional inch of puncture
prevention space which means even if
something were to you know be sharp and
length go through the box it would
actually have to go this far yes I punch
the box they would have to go this far
and then through the foam bra in order
to reach the case and do any damage so
it's quite clear to me that thermal tank
takes the safety of their products
during transit very very seriously I
haven't actually unboxed many thermal
products in the past so this will be a
bit of an adventure for me on the bottom
we found another pretty similar piece of
foam and finally here we have a black
shroud so this is scratch prevention for
the case also very handy to have if
you're ever transporting the case around
I'd recommend holding on to that because
then you can throw it in there with your
system in it
go to your land party or wherever you
happen to be going and your case will
not get scratched because if you have a
slick looking case like this odds are
you want it to stay slick looking and
not look stupid because it has a big old
scratch all the way across sided so I
have never actually seen a level-10 GT
in person which means this is going to
be a slightly more challenging unboxing
for me but let's go ahead and let's
start walking through the features so
we'll start at the front on the front we
find a few things we find four or five
and a quarter inch base which are
convenient and easy to remove by the
look of things yes they are we have one
three and a half inch front Bay which is
more than enough these days you throw
your card reader in there or whatever
the case may be we have a lock for the
front panel which is currently locked as
far as I can tell we have one two three
four five buttons oh and maybe that's
what's locked that is apparently what
locked right now so these buttons
probably do something okay also on the
front we have four front USB two we have
our front audio ports we have our hard
drive indicator our reset switch and our
power switch up at the top we have
settings for the fans high and low as
well as the thin led ambience and the
omlettes colors we have super speed USB
3.0 so that is a total of six yes six
front USB ports and finally we have an
eSATA port which the cameraman is no
longer interested in he is interested in
what appears to be a strip of LED
lighting and my guess is that there
reason there is no power LED included
for this particular case is that that
lighting is done here and here at the
front so I have found the key it was
strapped to the back I'm going to I
already talked about that he's trying to
point out things I forgot he loves that
you know ah so here I have unlocked the
harddrive cages so check that out so all
you got to do is mount either a two and
a half inch drive or a three and a half
inch drive into this removable sled lock
that back in place or press the button
and then you can see here on the bottom
is actually a little flat so that allows
you to get your fingers in there and
pull it out alright so here let's take
let's take those all out here I'm just
going to press those buttons unlock them
there we go this shows you how easily
and how quickly you can actually take
out all five of the hard drives in your
system which is why it features a lock
because that is how quickly somebody at
a LAN to take out all of the hard drives
in your system all right moving around
to the side we have a small window here
at the top showing you the CPU and RAM
area which is a great area to show you
because that's likely where your liquid
cooling is probably located okay we also
have some ventilation over here
including a headphone hanger I guess
that's something that you can attach to
that spot no need okay and then here we
have a cooling fan which is going to be
blowing nice cool air and it is filtered
actually there's your removable filter
look haha push it in unclick it push it
back in to lock it back in place it is
you've got a removable filter blowing
cool air over your graphics card there's
a security systems lock so I'm using
that same key same key very convenient
to unlock the side panel which I'm not
going to open up just yet let's have a
look at the back of the case first where
we have those grommets for liquid
cooling if you're using an external
radiator setup we've also got a rear 140
/ 120 mil
on Mount we've got our other security
key so there's two just in case you lose
one and we have one two three four five
six seven eight
PCI expansion slots very nice to see I
really like to see high end cases having
eight because even with a seven PCI slot
board sometimes you've got a bottom PCIe
16x slot so that way you can install a
dual slot card in it moving along to the
other side we see that thermaltake has
done an excellent job matching the white
finish on the metal parts of the case to
the white finish on the plastic parts of
the case that is a very challenging
thing actually come check it out right
here so here's the front plastic top
plastic and the side metal all in one
shot so the finish is very very similar
between all of those parts of the case
so give me a poke and cameraman wants to
look at the level 10 GT logo down there
which is very nice camera you did a good
job you did good okay give me a second
to get this opened up and I'll be back
now my initial thought was to open the
side panel we would actually flip this
switch but that didn't do it nope
there's an eject button
on the bottom you can see it's labeled
with a little eject thing and you go
ahead and swing the door open so that is
how you worked on your level 10 GT so
what was this switch for well that will
actually redirect the side panel fan
airflow either up to the top or down to
the bottom depending where your cooling
needs are so if you have your video
cards mounted in the bottom you put it
there
mount it in the top you put it there oh
yeah also you have what I think is a
very cool feature right here you have
little contacts here's little contact
pads here so that's how this side then
is powered you actually don't have to
worry about routing a cable from the
side panel into your case because it's
always very difficult to manage that
cable because well the case has to be
closed in order for you to route it and
once the case is closed very difficult
to do that so I like this that's a good
solution okay moving right along we have
our accessories which are in a box right
here so we'll go ahead you know what why
don't we look at the accessory package
first and then we'll move on
package first thing we find is some
cable ties along with the mounting
screws for all of our hard drives and
all of our other drives next we find a
full 810 CPU power extension cable very
handy if you have a shorter power supply
go ahead and clip the ha
there's the headphone hanger so this is
actually kind of a neat feature I need
one of these uh I mean this one
obviously won't fit on my case but there
you go you throw that on there boom and
your headphones on there no big deal oh
yeah I'm matching headphones check this
up I have cameraman Siberia headphones
yeah yeah it's not natural what we buy
steel series headphones throw them on
there then you with a winrar okay so
let's go ahead and get the next
accessory thing out so here we have a
guide manual thing okay that's it still
a fairly complete accessory package so
we've got protective covers on the front
what front
oh that's the eSATA plug there's your
internal HD audio plug front USB one
front USB to your front switches
including your power switch hopefully
somewhere here power switch there you go
and you've also got our front USB 3
cable so that goes to your front panel
header we've got some fan connectors for
the internal fan so let's go ahead and
I'll show you guys those fans we've got
a big little guy in the top we've got a
big old guy on the side panel we've got
our 140 millimeter fan here in the back
so that's where you're going to be able
to mount your liquid cooling single 120
mil rack now if you look up here on the
top if you take that 230 mil fan off
you've actually got mounting holes for a
dual 120 rad as well so this is a fully
liquid cooling ready case very good
thinking Thermaltake
all right we've got grommet holes for
our eight pin cpu connector grommet
holes for anything that goes up near the
top of our motherboard which is pretty
much nothing grommet holes for our 24
pin grommet holes for our PCI Express
and finally grommet holes for our front
panel connector so I'd take these put
them right back on with that hole where
they
came from and bring them up in the most
convenient places at the bottom of my
motherboard next we have our power
supply mounting which includes a
removable filter so that means you can
comfortably mount your power supply with
the fan facing down and it will be held
far enough off the ground in order to
draw air in appropriately and it will be
filtered finally we have power for the
mounts on assuming front
something-or-other
front I don't know something power for
the case oh yeah I know what that's for
come around the back with me cameraman
and I will show you that is not for this
actually that's for something else ok I
don't know what that's for let's find
out let's follow it
follow it follow it oh that's probably
for the fan controller ok there we go
mystery solved I don't know ok I'm not
gonna worry too much about it here we
have what is one of the best features in
this case the hot swap interface so that
has 5 SATA power connectors there you've
got 5 SATA data connectors here so this
is one of the smartest hot swap
interfaces I have yet seen it is
something that can be very easily taken
out if you don't want it you just take
out these screws you take them out you
don't want it fine no big deal no hot
swap you lock it up done throw away the
key no big deal ok then there's no PCD
these are straight pass throughs so you
don't run into any problems where you
have say for example a compatibility
conflict between SATA 2 and SATA 3
because it's just a straight pass
through copper to copper no
complications involved
next you relies on your own cables so
you can actually route the cables
however you want you can plug in the
power however you want it is fully
modular that way and last but not least
it is incredibly cheap to implement like
this so you're not going to have to pay
a ton extra for engineering that you
don't need there you go it's just a
smart way to do it as for the five and a
quarter inch base the mounting devices
are here so these are two lists you go
ahead
unlock lock unlock lock pretty standard
fare these days but there you go last
but not least I didn't see these before
there are feet so look at that you can
a little bit more stability for your
tower by letting out the four feet that
are along the bottom maybe we'll go
ahead and pull those out there we go and
that is it that is my level 10 GT
unboxing and first look and I'm actually
pretty impressed
big thanks to thermal tape for sending
this for us to check out and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos yeah after we finished I
found another secret compartment so to
speak you just press a button at the
back you pop this up so there that's how
you take out the included fan and you
install the dual 120 mils that you would
need for your radiator for something
such as of course our H 100 something
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
