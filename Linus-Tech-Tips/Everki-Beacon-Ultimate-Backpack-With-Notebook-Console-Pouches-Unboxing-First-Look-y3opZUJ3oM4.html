for me this is the only backpack that
I've ever unbagged on my channel and
there's a very good reason for that this
is an aversive a pack and it is designed
for technology users like myself so my
backpack that I usually use is a Windows
Vista brand backpack and we're going to
see how well the n'ver key stands up to
the kind of load that I typically carry
around with me fitting mouse mouse pad
um tablet you know various chargers
we're going to see how much room it has
and how well it can accommodate these
things so here we're going to have a
closer look that's okay so a very key
style that works this is the over key
beacon and what does it got to say for
itself in terms of features so
innovation is the result of challenging
the mind to overcome the obstacles that
others have sidestepped the design
studio uses this mentality to consistent
and play new and unique ideas in the
creation of our products I've heard very
good things about these backpacks so I'm
actually quite excited about this 180
degree variable opening front pocket
okay cool
four-point weight distribution for added
safety and comfort okay neat stowaway
weather resistant shield that's handy
dedicated paddock notebook slot with
anti scratch fur liner okay quick access
hip pockets with mobile phone audio
vents that's handy as well dual
reinforced handles for lifting heavy
loads
where are the dual reinforced handles
what we'll have to find those a little
bit later oh well here's one of them
okay and that does look reinforced
integrated audio cable management loop
okay interesting what else we got in
here limited lifetime warranty
protection ok that's handy so why don't
we why don't we get started here so on
the back we've gone a couple kind of an
adjustable looking straps
got a couple little leaks right here
I've got a hot here is our dedicated
audio cable management
do that so you can run your cable up
through here and up through here so it
won't get caught on anything when you're
taking your backpack on and off that is
incredibly handy the overall padding
quality on the straps I'd say is very
good comparable if not better than my
existing Windows Vista backpack but then
I think at almost as far as others
people are concerned almost anything as
an improvement over Windows Vista so
don't you see okay so sits right on my
great where on the shoulder okay
let's see what else we got here that
looks like probably the stowaway
weatherproof shield now weather proof is
sort of one of those things that gets
thrown around an awful lot I wouldn't
expect to be necessarily taking this you
know on a motorcycle with you in the
rain and expecting nothing inside to get
even down but I would expect it to keep
the rain off enough that nothing should
get damaged or soaked through this layer
and then this layer and then whatever
I'll see you have inside the bag so that
is a very cool little feature the fact
that it snows away like that means that
you can just kind of cram it away and
only use it and only have it affect the
aesthetic of the bag when you actually
need it so yeah there you go
weatherproof shield I could have just
read that little tag and then I'd have
known what it was so with audio vents
here are the audio vents
although look at that they're not just
simple openings so they should actually
be a little bit weather resistant
themselves so that's kind of nice there
we go yeah so there is a fabric on the
other side of it the liner you can also
use it for you know school if you're
like your mom's like why do you need
this bag you could be like oh because I
can store my pens and calculators in it
but really what you're doing is you're
putting like your phone and your DNA
whatever else you could still use DSS I
don't know this one does not have the
audio vents but it has a slightly
different cable management system and it
does have a loop for hanging you know
keychain or whatever else off of it so
that's kind of handy there you go you
got two little pockets there overall I'd
say the build quality is just
outstanding on this so far materials
used are very very robust feeling and
all the zippers have slid very very
easily well that was my fault okay so
let's keep going here is the 30 or 180
degree oh well there's the other
reinforced handle so there's the two
reinforced handles and they are
definitely about as reinforced as they
get so let's keep undoing things here
let's see what this is so here we have
some stowage stuff so there's a pocket
there love lots and lots of individual
little pockets helps you stay organized
so that goes in there and then we've got
up hold on let's do this one first so
there is the laptop hmm
check this out so it's not real for very
disappointed about that actually I'm not
it's ok so it's not real fur but that is
very very soft so let's go ahead and see
if it will fit my huge 15.4 inch gaming
laptop Wow very easily tons and tons of
space left over once I put my notebook
in there so that's that's awesome it
barely barely barely fits in my law in
my Microsoft bag so here why don't we
leave that in there all right so let's
keep going here so here is a how is this
the inside no you know what give me a
second figure out how this works ok so
we figured out how the 180 degree
opening thing works you just undo these
buckles and then these zippers actually
go all the way down to the bottom of the
bag however I'm not going to bother
doing that for the video and then this
just looks like another padded like
pouchy thing that you can you can put
stuff in so this does go in here lift
it's fur-lined
give nests and then you know maybe if we
had a tablet computer that we wanted to
have a little bit of extra padding we
could check that in there although it
looks like you could keep like another
laptop in it no problem although you
don't have to use it so you can take it
out and then you've got a bunch more
pouches and pockets and stuff so
actually that's probably a better place
for my tablet there we go
try that in there and then we've got
pieces of velcro here that help you to
keep this button closed it also will
hold this nope this is to close this
okay good now I understand okay I mean
really it's how they intend you to use
it is sort of not that important but the
most important thing is just there's
lots of different ways to organize your
stuff in here so we've got this is just
a divider it doesn't go all the way down
to the bottom that feels fairly well
built so it should stand up to the test
of time and then this can be closed up
there so you can hold in whatever's
there then you finally got with more
padding on the bottom although hello
that's that's kind of that's kind of
cute dual dual usage padding so that's
your rain proof shield down there and
then finally some more pockets this is
where I might keep something like spare
batteries or jeweler screwdrivers or
whatever other tools and I'll look at
that they're lined with a with nice soft
material also look at that oh that's
awesome
even the sides pretty good attention to
detail in here I can see why these bags
are are becoming so popular cool well I
think that pretty much covers it so just
to to remind you guys again this is the
over key beacon and I think that it
would not the bottoms like a very very
thick robust rubbery material you could
pretty much drag this thing around and I
wouldn't expect it to be subjected to
any real damage so thank you here I
wouldn't be complete without you know a
fashion show shot of it and don't forget
