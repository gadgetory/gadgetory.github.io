to unbox this is well three different
products but they're all NZXT cables and
I'm gonna just start tearing the
packaging open because that's what I do
okay so now I'll explain what they are
these are sleeved extension cables so
basically what this allows you to do I
don't know if you've heard of a murder
mod but there's there's a guy who's
actually from Vancouver and he started
this this whole murder mod thing where
people started sleeping their cables
individually into the connector rather
than doing the whole bunch as one big
sleeve and then exposing the coloured
bits at the ends now his reasoning for
doing that was that actually you don't
see most of the cable so most of that
sleeved part you're gonna hide behind
something and then the only part that
actually goes on to your motherboard I
guess is building it this way is the
part that's going to be colored so
there's no point in sleeping it the
other way so that's why he started
sleeping every cable individually so
NZXT knowing that it's actually a lot of
work to sleeve a cable like that like
it's it could take you hours to do your
power supply hours and hours so they've
released these extension cables that
will allow you to basically take your 24
pin connector for example hide it away
somewhere and then run an extension
cable over to it and then actually plug
the attractive individually sleeved
cable into your motherboard now instead
XT is also using a very high quality
sleeping so you can see that you cannot
see any of the colors of the individual
wires through the sleeving which is very
nice I'll actually know it looks like
they're cheating a little bit but that's
okay they're using black wires for every
wire and then a blacks leaving over it
so it looks like a very very nice
finishing touch overall once you come
out from you know for example your well
on a motherboard that isn't old and
doesn't suck your coming out from behind
the board plugging into the ideal 24 pin
location and it'll look kind of
something like that okay so they've got
a variety of other cables available as
well I've got a couple of them here
today
this one is a molex to SATA cable so
suppose you bought a modular power
supply now you don't even have to plug
in a single SATA connector to your power
supply
plug in a molex and then run this
adapter over to four SATA cables so if
you've got four hard drives mounted one
on top of the other you've got this
attractive for SATA mounting cable
sleeved thing that you can plug into it
now and it looks so much more sharp than
having those colored orange and yellow
and red and black wires all over your
case now last but not least I'm going to
show you the I mean it's going to be
basically that I'm showing you the same
thing again but this is an eight pin
extension cable so you do the same thing
that you did with your 24 pin but with
your four or eight pin motherboard
connector connector so you hide it back
somewhere you run it around to the top
and now you've got a nice attractive
individually sleeved wire thing going on
so these will be available at NCIX soon
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the NZXT individually sleeved cables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
