four gig ones enough to install an OS
for free with press kits about new
products or whatever on them they've got
to do something pretty special in order
to grab my attention especially if they
come from a company that doesn't
normally even make USB drives like
visiontek Corsair Gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more so this isn't vision Tech's
first portable SSD they actually had a
product that let you plug an M SATA SSD
into a little enclosure then connect
that to your PC via USB 3 although it's
certainly they're much more elegant one
so much like the nine zero zero six nine
six the nine zero zero seven one eight
they really got to work on their product
names promises much better performance
than a normal high-capacity USB drive by
using an LSI Sam force 2281 SSD
controller yeah the same kind that a
desktop SSD would use rather than a
normal thumb drive controller to
interact with the flash chips on the
drive but this time instead of some
clergy dongle and fragile and SATA drive
you're getting a solid aluminum housing
one that is evidently assembled in the
USA if that kind of thing is important
to you that is both heavy and rugged
feeling enough for me to be fairly
confident that I could kill a man with
it oh sorry I didn't tell them I was
going to do that if the need arose it
also has a metal key chain loop on one
end a nice upgrade from the last SSD
controller based USB Drive I checked out
and a standard rubber USB port cover a
significant downgrade from other designs
that I've seen that is sure to get lost
quite quickly and then the last nice
thing I have to say about it physically
completing the sandwich is that
compared to that other Drive it's much
skinnier making inserting it in two
closely spaced ports much easier a bit
more on specs Before we jump into
benchmarks though it's backwards
compatible with USB 2 but obviously were
best on a USB 3 port with support for
you a SP a data transfer protocol that's
better optimized for random reads and
writes and visiontek claims that you can
achieve up to 445 megabytes per second
read and 440 megabytes per second write
well above what we were able to do with
our Flash Voyager GTX from Corsair the
only other similar SSD in your pocket
based product that we've seen so here we
are we've got a pretty simple benchmark
suite today black magics disk speed test
gives us a really clear idea of how this
drive will perform in what is in my
daily life anyway
a typical workload by reading and
writing compressible data to and from
the drive it should be noted that it's
important that the data is compressible
for a SAN force base drive like this
because it will not perform nearly as
well with incompressible data especially
given how few flash chips there are on
the drive itself so while it appears
that I wasn't able to replicate the
numbers from the box this is still one
wicked fast USB Drive about the same
speed as our angel bird SSD to go pocket
that is considerably bulkier and more
expensive but then also available in
higher capacities we've got a 120 gig
version of the vision tech here but
there's also a 240 gig and that is
pretty much it now it should be noted
guys when looking at these results that
you will need to be cognizant of what
USB 3 controller you're using on your
computer because if you have an older
one you might not see numbers this high
with anything the Voyager GTX the
visiontek USB 3 120 gig solid-state
drive man they got to work on their
product names or the angel bird so thank
you guys for watching like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you just
liked it leave a comment if your
feelings are more complicated than this
also check out the link in the video
description you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one give us a monthly
contribution or change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
so we get a small kickback whenever you
buy USB drives whoo look at all the USB
drives thanks again for watching and as
