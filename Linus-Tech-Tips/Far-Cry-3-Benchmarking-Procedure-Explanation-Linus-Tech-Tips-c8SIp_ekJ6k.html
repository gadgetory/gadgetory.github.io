just took one out with a bow and arrow
with fire on it so there you go take
that tiger but in all seriousness this
video is about our Far Cry 3
benchmarking procedure so we want to
show you guys exactly how we run it down
to well ok the settings will vary
depending on what class of graphics
cards were running but we want to show
you how we achieve a reproducible
real-world benchmarking scenario so it's
in this case slick found one of the
trials that involves racing around a
course and we want to show you guys how
you can run exactly the same benchmark
as us using fraps and compare your
system to whatever we're testing on our
test bench this will give you a really
good idea of how it stacks up compared
to newer hardware that comes out as we
test it so without further ado here is
slicks benchmarking procedure for Far
Cry 3
so what'd you see me doing actually has
nothing to do with the benchmarking
procedure that you just saw quite
clearly but oops shooting civilians will
not be tolerated repair I just blew one
up like two seconds ago and it didn't
seem to care but I just want to show you
guys what we run in fraps in order to
run the benchmark so settings wise we
are going to set a benchmarking hotkey
and set it to stop benchmarking after
120 seconds we always run a two-minute
run now I would recommend for
consistency sake do some practice and
see how close you can get it with the
same hardware in the same settings
before you rely on yourself to use this
to actually measure performance so all
you have to record is min Max and
average and it's going to spit out a CSV
file that looks a little something like
this
C colon slash fraps benchmarks and
here's all the benchmarks we've run on
this drive since we started it up so
here let's have a look at I don't know
some Far Cry 3 benchmark or something so
this will tell you the minimum the
maximum errantly this particular run
slick was basically looking at a rock
because that's very very consistent
impacts on average but that's pretty
much it don't forget to subscribe to
