scenario for the gtx 590 I wanted to
have a look at its performance and 3d
vision in a couple of 3d vision ready
games one of the ones that i picked was
batman arkham asylum i'm running at 1920
x 1080 so that is 1080p 4x anti-aliasing
and all of the details are maxed out
completely now what I did discover about
batman arkham asylum as well as one of
the other games that i was running in 3d
hawx 2 is that it can pretty well run
the game completely maxed out with
absolutely no slowdowns whatsoever at
60fps you can see the fraps counter up
in the top corner and pretty much no
matter what I do in terms of gameplay it
just stays tagged at 60 frames per
second so I haven't actually tested any
of the other solutions yet but once I
have a chance i'll hopefully i'll be
able to show some kind of a difference
in the performance now i wish as much as
the next guy that 3d vision would
support higher Reza's but right now the
biggest limiting factor is the displays
or rather the display interfaces because
deedie i only supports up to 1920 x 1200
at 120 hertz which is required for 3d
vision or it supports 2560 by 1600 at 60
hertz so we're pretty much stuck with
1080p as a maximum resolution so I just
wanted to discuss the requirements for
3d vision before I get into my results
so first of all you'll need the 3d
vision glasses either with the ir
emitter or the wired version that is
just about to come out or is already out
depending on when you're watching this
video you'll need a 3d vision ready
graphics card so pretty much any geforce
8800 series and up gaming great graphics
card is going to be ok for that and then
you'll also need a 3d vision ready
display in this case i'm using Anasuya
g23 VG 236 but you can also even use
that projectors so if you
actually sort of look over here you know
what I could turn my light on here and
then we'd probably be getting better
quality video but you can also use a 3d
vision projector so here I've got an
acer 3d vision projector that I've been
tinkering around with in the last little
bit so yeah I'll be bringing some
results to you I'm only going to be
comparing it against high end solutions
so I'm going to be comparing it against
a single gtx 580 as well as gtx 460 s in
sli to see how they stack up
you
so hopefully you guys enjoyed the charts
and graphs segment of our video today so
this is I'm going to try to help you
guys interpret the results as much as I
can here because some of them might be a
little bit confusing like batman arkham
asylum and hawks to both show our gtx
590 performing pretty much identically
to gtx580 sli but also pretty much
identically to do if i can find it gtx
560 SL I so why is that well the reason
is that in 3d vision your capped add a
number of different frame rates so what
it does is the driver takes the closest
lowest frame rate bet ate that beta
takes the closest fixed frame rate and
it takes the highest possible one and
then it stops it there so basically if
you're in a game like batman arkham
asylum or hawks to wear it always can
run higher than 60 FPS it'll run at
60fps in your negate if you're in a game
like battlefield bad company 2 where you
saw two of our results for around that
40 FPS mark what that means is the game
is probably running somewhere between 45
to 55 FPS but the nearest fixed frame
rate is 40 so they 60 and 40 or two of
the ones that we do encounter so that's
why those results are so clustered so
hawks to in batman arkham asylum
basically what we learned is that those
games are not limited in any way by
these graphics card configurations at
1080p fully maxed out running 3d vision
now battlefield bad company 2 on the
other hand has kind of confusing results
because you see that those are my hot
cross buns okay you can clearly see that
the gtx 580 sli destroys the 590 by a
margin that shouldn't be possible
because gtx 580 sli is faster than a 590
but not by that much so the reason for
that is again the same thing so the gtx
580 sli score is almost
d frames per second which means that it
was probably running above 60 frames per
second but then capped at 60 frames per
second for most of the the the the
segment of the game that I played
through whereas the gtx 590 was just
under that threshold where it couldn't
run at 60fps most of the time so I had
to drop itself all the way down to 40
which means that you get much leggy or
performance in that particular title now
I mean I had everything pretty much
maxed out you can back off a couple
details don't get me wrong you'll get a
very very enjoyable 3d vision gaming
experience on the 590 in bad company 2
but that is why we saw the results that
we did and that's once again why the 590
was so close to our 560 result Metro
2033 is the one probably the only one
where we actually see sensible scaling
so this game at very high quality with
everything completely maxed out in game
is probably too much for any of these
solutions so really I find Metro 2033
doesn't look much different on high the
only reason I benchmark on very high it
so that I can just say all maxed out
because that's a little bit easier for
people to to try on their own rigs to
compare against my results so I guess
that's pretty much it that's all I
wanted to say about it thank you for
