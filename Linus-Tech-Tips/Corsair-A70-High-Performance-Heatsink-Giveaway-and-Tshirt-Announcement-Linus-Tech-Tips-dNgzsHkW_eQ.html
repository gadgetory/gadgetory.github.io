video we have a very special
announcement to make the cameraman has
just finished his work yes he actually
does do work from time to time updating
the linus tech tips channel with
official tech tips gear now so you can
get official t-shirts unbox your
t-shirts butter knife t-shirts as well
as throw away CD t-shirts so when the
channel actually gets updated with this
I don't know if he's actually completely
done yet but he showed me this as a
preview and I love it then you can go to
our cafepress store where you can buy
shirts that are tech tips themed so this
one is the professional unbox ur t-shirt
I just want to get the larger view for
you here so it has a box and it says
professional unbox er you can read into
that whatever you will I won't judge you
and then next we have the back button
not working because this is a mac and it
sucks then we have oh yeah yeah here we
go tech tips with just the the trademark
orange screwdriver as well as the linus
tech tips logo and this is actually one
of my favorites right here relax i
remembered my knife mm-hmm so these are
all sort of themes from the show and you
can buy them or you cannot it's up to
you but you've also got throw away the
CD which i think should be a popular one
among viewers now i also have a little
contest to announce along with this
video if you post a video response to
this video and you show us your favorite
t-shirt then you will be entered for a
chance to win a corsair a 70 cpu cooler
this is their latest high performance
cpu cooler it's compatible with LGA 775
1156 and 1366 as well as a m2 and m3 on
the AMD side so no matter what kind of
system you're running you can use this
new cooler it has a two year warranty
and I haven't unboxed it yet so I guess
you'll be getting a new one how very
exciting would that be now but wait
there's more this is going to run for
probably about a month so if you order
one of the official Linus tech tip
shirts and you post your video response
wearing one of those shirts then I can
tell you now you stand a much better
chance to win and it will definitely
improve your odds so thank you for
checking out this video on the linus
tech tips official gear that is now
available and good luck to anyone who
wants a chance to win the a 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
