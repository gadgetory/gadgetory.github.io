again welcome to my unboxing and first
look at the a data 64 gig nobility and
005 the news ok USB 3 thumb drive now
you guys might wonder why am i unboxing
a thumb drive what is the point of
unboxing a thumb drive to which I would
answer the point is speed because this
thumb drive is capable of reading it up
to 180 megabytes per second and which
makes it a hundred and twenty percent
faster than what I don't know but it's a
pro drive it also is very big look at
this thing but very big in a way that's
not sort of ridiculous like this this
Drive drives me crazy because look how
wide it is see this is this is a
kingston drive and like look the USB
interface isn't even like centered so by
the time you plug that into anything you
can't plug in anything next to it this
drive right here is long because it has
to have multiple flash chips on it
there's nothing we can do about the
physics of that but it's narrow enough
that you should still be able to plug
other devices in nearby it has a cap
that shouldn't be 20 it only goes on one
way I wish it was reversible but it's
not the end of the world has a spot here
for a queuing you know what the whole
point of this is basically speed so
we'll be back in a moment we'll show you
guys a real world test of the speed of
this drive alright so we're plugged into
we're using an as media controller on
this particular shuttle PC and we've got
it plugged into our front USB 3 just for
lulz we're trying a bit of a new
benchmark we're using the black magic
disk speed test to find out what we can
actually get in terms of like real world
sustained reads and writes now 86
megabytes per second is some pretty
beast write speeds for a USP tribe that
is absolutely out
standing the read speeds weren't as fast
as we saw advertised on the box but 120
megabytes per second reads are still
very respectable now that's not
necessarily the be-all and end-all of
benchmarks so what we might do here is
take a 1.27 gigabyte file and copy that
over two hour drive and see if we can do
on my iphone in my pockets I don't have
a time or bubble time it there you go
now I run into some problems the first
time I did this benchmark so I'm sorry
I'm going to completely different place
to have been completely different things
I'm Idina drive plugged into the
as media controller on this particular
issue sports p9x79 deluxe I've got my 88
a drive here so we're going to do a
quick test of a coffee speeds and since
i'm using windows 8 we should actually
be able to get a fairly accurate
representation so these two files are
about one gig each so it looks like
we're writing at about eighty five
megabytes per second consistently to the
drive which is very very cool stuff now
if we take some other USB 3 drive but we
go ahead and copy that exact same file
to it what I'm expecting to see is
significantly different results i'm
going to go ahead pull up my knee data
drive i'm going to put in this as a
patriot transporter xt usb3 drive so
still you sp3 it's going to be faster
than a USB to drive but not expecting
anything near as Extreme as what we just
saw so let's open a folder to view the
files let's go ahead and copy this bad
boy in here so we're seeing about 36
megabytes per second which is not the
same as the ad to drive so not all USB 3
drives are created equal if you guys
thought that then you're probably
mistaken about that particular notion
now what I want to do is I want to go
ahead and read off of the drives to find
out what the difference is there all
right let's truly a day to drive back in
here i've rebooted just to make sure
that there's no funny caching issues
with the files in windows or anything
like that so we've got our drive open
now
my few here so you guys can see what's
going on and we are going to copy it
into the root of the drive and see what
happens i need to administrator
permission I'll show you administrative
permission 170 megabytes per second 174
average of 175 so guess guys it's not
quite the 180 megabytes per second that
they advertised and honestly the rights
aren't quite there either but I think
what we're about to see when we throw
our Patriot drive back on the backend
test bench is that it is pretty
significantly more baller than just your
average USB Drive I mean this is pretty
cool it's a fairly large product but I
still think that you definitely see kind
of a value add to it here if it's going
to go and go and be that much faster
especially in terms of reeds let's copy
it somewhere else will copy it to the
AMD folders to sure that nothing silly
is happening here so here we go we see a
much more mundane mundane read speed
around 35 megabytes per second so thank
you for checking out my little
benchmarking review video of a data's
and 005 pro the coach descent appalled
at the end 008 the new the new drive

can't find my remote control how am I
gonna turn off the street know who's
hiding right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
