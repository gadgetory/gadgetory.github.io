the site Tech X 55 but I think it's time
for me to have a little me time with the
large and in charge warthog a tent HOTAS
from Thrustmaster if I'm lucky I may
even get to take this hose test joystick
set up to play with in a cockpit
fractal design listens and the define r5
case was made with feedback from you the
PC community so click here to learn more
after spending extensive time with an
arrangement of joysticks the main
difference I've found with the Warthog
a10 is that it lacks any and all toy
like feeling every other joystick or
HOTAS combo setup I tried either felt
too light resulting in it flopping
around or I could easily feel the cheap
plastic construction neither of which
were true with the a10 which is probably
as it should be considering this thing
is 550 canadian dollars let's start with
the joystick excel the sheer weight of
this thing is phenomenal at 3 kilograms
and in combination with the 4 rubber
pads at the bottom
even without bolting it to your desk
through the included screw holes you'll
have a hard time actually making this
thing flop around under proper use which
is really good in terms of buttons it's
got you covered
- pinkie push buttons one with a lever
one exposed one metal dual trigger 2
standard push buttons one four-way hat
that has push functionality - 8 Way hats
and 1/8 way point of view hat it has a
16 bit resolution for joystick positions
and a 5 coil spring system which they
claim will deliver firm linear and fluid
tension with no dead zones and I'd have
to agree with them moving this joystick
around is notably more fluid than any
other ones I had used the spring system
has just enough tension to help you in
making precise movements without
overshooting your target and will also
help you keep steady through the
firmness I mentioned earlier the buttons
and the trigger feel real but this may
or may not be a good thing for you if
you want to get the closest experience
to being an actual pilot while in the
safety of your own home
this is probably for you but if you're
just looking to play arcade shooters
with fast activating twitch buttons and
triggers and whatnot then maybe not the
metal trigger feels great but it's heavy
and has long travel distance which may
be good for you but it's a little slow
compared to something like the aviator
oh one which has short travel time and
light trigger overall same deal with the
buttons other joysticks felt more like
toys with short travel times and very
low force for
required to press them down resulting in
very quick inputs where with the a-10 it
takes a lot more in tension if you shoot
someone with the a-10 you meant it I get
this as its namesakes suggests the US
Air Force approved the hotel as a
replica for an actual a-10 warthog for
military applications it's probably
beneficial to not have hair triggers all
over the place for diplomatic reasons
and while squeezing the metal trigger of
the a-10 may make you feel like a god it
will take a little bit more effort than
the others next up we have the dual
throttles you have one three position
switch one position being momentary
while the other two are permanent two
three position switches with all buttons
being permanent one three position
switch with to being momentary and one
being permanent one standard push button
one four-way hat with push button
functionality one eight way hat and one
mouse hat with push button and three
magnetic sensor which basically covers
what's on the throttle itself not even
just the control panel around it which
has a metric ton of included switches
and knobs as well the throttles have the
option to separate if you want
independent engine control and even
afterburner support if you want to go
that route Mountain the a-10 has that
the throttle has 14-bit resolution on
each throttle as well and if you missed
any of the buttons you can find a list
on their website which also happens to
include the line realistic pressure on
buttons and switches which is
essentially reiterating what I brought
up before just like the joystick this
thing doesn't feel like a toy switches
are made of high-quality heavy materials
and take some force to move they feel
amazingly real but again they can be a
little slow when compared to their
arcade style competition even the
throttle fell under this umbrella it
isn't fast and it won't really cater to
twitch movements even with the friction
dial turned down but it feels smooth it
feels real it makes you want to put on a
flight jacket some aviators listen to
danger zone and drive to the air base on
a motorcycle
basically it's top gun badass that
leaves us with one thing left the
software the hardware included is an
incredible work of art and thrust
masters target command software is like
and unfortunately abandoned back road
McDonald's which has been mostly
reclaimed by the earth it's terrible
manipulating this software is tedious
and while they do have downloadable
profiles many of them still require
further input and customization on your
own if you're set on buying this HOTAS
please note that it will take us some
serious time to get it properly set up
but the software does seem to be stable
so if you have an iron will and are
willing to fight with key binding for
potentially hours while you kind of
learn the ropes you'll have a stable
setup in the end I spent the time it
sucked
but in the end it was definitely worth
it flame star citizen and elite
dangerous on this thing fill me with the
true and pure excitement that I haven't
felt in a while it feels real and a
small part of you feels like you're
actually there once I'm able to properly
combine these with a VR setup I hope
someone will feed me because I don't
know if I'll ever be able to come back
out in conclusion if you're looking for
a replica if you'll hear something
that'll make you feel like you're really
flying a fighter jet or a spaceship or
if you're just a fan of quality
construction the Thrustmaster
a-10 warthog HOTAS may be for you
although you may have to save up for
awhile to afford the hefty but probably
deserved 550 canadian dollar price tag
this thing is incredibly configurable if
you're willing to struggle with it it
feels great in hand and has a wonderful
hefty weight and tactile feedback the
solid build quality and weight will keep
it on the table even in a nasty dogfight
and in a zombie apocalypse you could
probably use it as a melee weapon but it
is crazy expensive and you may have a
hard time keeping up with the little
guys with their twitch tastic
hair-trigger setups what do you guys
think let me know down below or over on
the forum preferably are you looking for
something that feels real and has some
crazy build quality to it are you
looking for more hair triggers and
arcade style setups I won't judge don't
worry I like this one but I won't judge
anyways while you're down below
subscribe follow like dislike favorites
share all that kind of stuff don't
forget to jump over to the forum and
check out the support links changing
your Amazon affiliate code will help us
a ton and jumping on any of our sponsors
will help us as well if you want a shirt
that isn't about Star Wars I wore this
because of these things you can check
out our shirt link in the description
down below as well we've got some cool
ones like sleep is for pussies which
I'll hopefully be wearing on a 24-hour
charity stream that I'll do once
- probably gets back because right now I
don't have time for that anyways thank
you guys for watching I'll see you next
