US dollars worth of materials in it but
it launched at a retail price of 840
what and the iPhone 10 while actually a
little cheaper to assemble at three
hundred and seventy dollars retails to
start at about a thousand what if you
could buy a phone for much closer to its
actual cost well it turns out you can
welcome back to another installment of
why the five Italian friendly content
are you guys buying this where today
we've got one of the top-selling phones
on Chinese e-tailer gearbest
the 213 dollar you me digi s - not to be
confused with the Samsung Galaxy s2 also
today is this exciting opportunity to
learn about madrenas coffee madrenas
coffee blends specialty cold brew coffee
Zin two 16-ounce grab-and-go cans for
everyone's convenience actually just the
convenience of their customers check
them out and use offer code Linus to
save 40% today
the Umi did G or Jimmy did G yeah let's
go with them s2 has hundreds of reviews
awarding it four point seven eight out
of five stars on average and you can
order one of these puppies for just two
hundred and twenty nap okay actually it
depends what warehouse you order it from
because gearbest is super weird but
let's call it two hundred and thirteen
dollars now based on the language of the
bulk of the reviews the s2 has been a
bigger hit in Russia Poland and Italy
than it has in the fancy-ass US and day
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
you'll get ridiculed by your flagship
fondling friends because the s2 doesn't
look like a budget phone it has a
six-inch edge to edge display in the
chic 18 by 9 aspect ratio and anodized
aluminum chassis with a USB type-c port
and it's got a dual lens for your camera
right above the rear fingerprint reader
and the internals aren't terrible either
unlike some value smartphones it's got
64 gigs of storage and it's expandable
via microSD in the dual SIM slot it has
the same amount of RAM as the Google
pixel too and it has nearly double the
rated battery capacity of the iPhone 10
50 100 milliamp hours so in practice
getting it to two days is a pretty easy
feat now compare that to what budget
phones were like just a few years ago
the Samsung Galaxy s5 and the motorola
moto e both launched in 2014 with a
similar price differential to what we're
looking at here except that the Moto e
was 50% thicker than the galaxy s5 had
half the RAM and didn't have a front
camera at all so how then have companies
like Umi digi which was only founded in
2012 managed to close the gap so much
well there are three main reasons first
the small brands avoid some of the
expenses that eventually
ricky'll down into the price of premier
brand phones so they use off-the-shelf
components instead of researching and
developing their own cutting-edge tech
they focus on online and guerilla style
marketing instead of doing things like
spending fifteen million dollars on a
single Superbowl commercial
they rely on established ecommerce
platforms like gearbest and Amazon
instead of trying to build out their own
stores and they benefit from what's
called the economies of agglomeration
what that means is that since everything
is made in and around Shenzhen China
they have easy access to manufacturing
talent and inexpensive labor without
having to invest much in their own
logistics the second way that Chinese
companies keep the price down is by
flat-out paying less for their
components and now I'm not even
necessarily talking about using older
inferior technology I'm talking about
using the exact same parts that could be
in your Samsung or your Apple phone but
for less money so how do they get a deal
like that
the answer is binning a big brand with a
reputation to uphold will by the
suppliers best parts they're a parts
batches of thousands of units where
maybe only 1% of them are likely to fail
that manufacturer's quality checks but
as for value brands like this one
they'll buy batches with significantly
higher failure rates and much lower
price tags to match strategy number
three for keeping the cost down is to
just not make any profit on the device
now only digi doesn't do this but Jamie
famously sells their phones with zero
profit margin in exchange for market
share and brand recognition paying the
bills ostensibly by selling accessories
like headphones power banks luggage and
really slippers ok so does all of this
mean then that soon there will be no
reason whatsoever to buy a flagship from
Google Apple or Samsung the answer is No
no it doesn't because budget foams still
have a lot of cut corners the s2 screen
for example looks like it was just glued
on to the front of a phone instead of
being seamlessly integrated into the
camp furred edges though in fairness
once you put it into the included
sandstone case that particular flaw
melts away with that said there's no
hiding the resolution the s2 has about
the same number of pixels as the iPhone
6 from 2014 but they're spread over a
larger area
giving it about half the pixel density
of the leading phones its size and this
is noticeable when you're reading text
and in particular in the way that
Netflix seems to handle streaming
content to this phone it looks
noticeably worse than even other value
devices and then there's the camera
while it isn't a complete potato patch
the dual lens business is basically a
complete marketing gimmick because the
bokeh mode doesn't do I mean it just
doesn't work like at all it just kind of
makes everything but the center of the
frame blurry it's it's just stupid like
look at this it's just it's just it's
like rubbing Vaseline on every part of
the lens that isn't the very center here
nobody takes pictures like that I mean
never mind not having a I assisted you
know bokeh background removal there's no
there's no I even there's no
consideration of depth at all it's a
total joke
and then finally there's the support or
lack thereof I was having issues with my
pixel to itself and Google quickly
effortlessly dealt with the RMA for me
even offering advanced replacement I
would be floored to hear a similar story
about you me digi and as for software
this thing is running Android
marshmallow which launched in 2015 and
it will probably run marshmallow forever
but might not seem like a huge deal on
the surface but Android didn't even have
a built-in
- light utility at that point and it's
got Google now on tap instead of the
assistant which you can't get unless you
do this one weird trick that phone
manufacturers hate so is it time for you
to stop spending your life savings every
time you need a new phone
the Umeda gs2 is a near stock if a
little dated Android experience with
almost no bloat and it's not even that
slow so if you don't care much about the
camera and some people don't I say it's
time for us to take a long hard look in
the mirror and ask ourselves do I really
need the latest and greatest need is a
strong word but the speakers are awful
fast charging is a super nice thing to
have and that oh man
that Netflix experience I don't remember
the last time I saw a movie look this
bad and I like Marvel movies speaking of
