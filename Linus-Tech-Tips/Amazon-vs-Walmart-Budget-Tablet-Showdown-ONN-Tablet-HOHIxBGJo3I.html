deplorable barely anyone that matters
even still bothers to make them and
they're so far behind Apple's iPad in
basically every way that matters that I
wouldn't blame people for not even
knowing that they exist and a
consequence of that is that for the ones
that do exist you basically want to
spend as little as possible on them
while still getting good enough
performance for the things you want to
do because remember low price does not
always equal good value so if you're in
the market then for an inexpensive
device that you can like use to watch
movies in bed or look at recipes in your
kitchen or into a kid to run off with
yes around I mean I'm not giving them my
note 9 that's for sure so today we're
gonna be taking a look at Walmart's
10-inch entrant into the budget Android
tablet market and determining is it even
worth $80 or should you just pony up
double for the reigning incumbent best
selling cheap Android tablets the Amazon
Fire HD 10 that's fine that's just the
box speaking of fine our sponsor for
today's video thanks to world of tanks
for sponsoring this video
it's the free-to-play epic online
multiplayer game that features authentic
tanks from the mid 20th century use the
invite code take tastic at the link
below to get some great bonuses
so I think the first thing that I want
to know is what exactly is it about this
that makes it a Walmart tablet this just
looks like they took whatever Chinese
tablet they could find and then they put
this sticker on it that entitles you to
$20 of e-books from Walmart ebooks oh I
think they did slightly more than that
because this is actually Walmart's in
store brand oh it's the same brand of
the tv-tv
yes okay but different than the laptops
and desktops
that's the overpowered brand okay so
then Walmart just either doesn't employ
very good graphic designers or they went
out of their way to make this look I
think so is that an expectation
management strategy for sure like you
want a box that attracts the type of
customer that this appeals to if the box
is super premium looking I might not
even look at the features of the price
because I expect it's out of my price
range got it okay so it's 10.1 inches
it's got a 1.3 gigahertz processor 2
gigs of RAM 16 gigs of storage and a
claimed battery life of five and a half
hours now that's not a huge battery life
claim no it's really not but if that's
screen on time it's also not entirely
unreasonable well this one here by
contrast claims ten hours which is
double that but this is kind of better
in almost every way except for the RAM
which is the same it has more memory
starting at 32 and an option to go to 64
this is really not a very impressive
display even just aside from text being
kind of blurry like when I have a web
browser open you can see here even just
basic app icons have kind of a fuzziness
to them and that's because it's only
running at 1280 by 800 resolution worse
than that though is that there's a
really really big air gap like it's been
a while since I've seen one this big
between the panel behind and the glass
on top so it kind of feels like your
finger is floating above the icons you
trying to hit as opposed to actually
touching them now with that said the
actual responsiveness of it is far from
the worst I've seen this is running
Android actually a pretty pure Android 9
while this has Amazon
Oh ass on it that's a smoother animation
for sure though so that's a bit of a
double-edged sword because you've got
all the Amazon junk pre-loaded and you
have to sideload your Android apps
that's right there's no Google Play
Store in here but this one's not perfect
because you can see there's an extra
button here besides your multitask and
home and back button what's that button
look like a Walmart Walmart logo what
happens oh thank goodness I have a
dedicated button to shop at Walmart or
more grocery Sam's Club open up Vudu and
Walmart's ebooks of course which I get
$20 of credit for thank you okay so this
is me trying to put the volume down and
it's going up and I would think that the
left side is intuitively down yeah but
if I let's check that out if I rotate it
down down down is up and down wait wait
I get it now that the volume button it's
not designed to be used like this it's
designed to be used like this so there's
your volume up and there's your volume
down it's right there at your thumb so
your palm could just accidentally turn
it off I'm not saying I support this
we're gonna make you say you're saying
that's what it is
oh that is not HD that sounds awful oh
my god that doesn't even look like like
HD yeah like I'm talking 720 HD
okay let's compare the sound though
that's a lot better
easily twice as good give me that one
again not as loud nope and it fuel it
sounds vibrating Anthony Hopkins does
not sound like that yeah no it's day and
night
yeah Dan Nate so that's a clear victory
for Amazon what's our next step then
well we can do a gaming evaluation but
here's where it gets a little tricky
this one uses the Amazon Appstore the
only one that was on here was passmark
okay so I got past mark in there and we
can run the benchmark side-by-side so I
went and did some tours for a bit and
you're done
I've been done for a while and by you're
done I mean um
some of these tests don't seem that bad
like the 1.1 gigabytes per second of
storage speed wait oh no that was memory
oh oh oh
31 megabytes a second you might as well
be running off an SD card it's literally
1/10 the storage speed like never mind
half and that makes a big difference on
a device like this but what about the
camera
oh let's see who can take the greatest
picture of this tabletop gaming stuff
here oh my goodness maybe it'll be
better once it actually gets to process
it so here's my processed image it's
really not any better than if you find
whoa
so I'd say there's some over sharpening
and this is a little bit too saturated
but it's definitely better okay so it
sucks but the question at the top of
this video was is it good enough like if
you can pay less is this one good enough
to get done what you want to get done I
would say for the discerning customer no
I would either pay the extra for this
one or I would just step down to a
smaller Amazon tablet knowing that I'm
at least gonna get a reasonably color
calibrated screen if it ran Netflix
without compression artifacts all over
the freaking place I'd say yeah at half
the price I'll just save the money
because the build quality of it well not
exceptional by any stretch is it's not
gonna fall apart it's it's it's robust
enough that you could toss it onto the
couch with confidence it's just not good
enough that I could recommend it as
anything other than a secondary tablet
for the kids and I would personally take
the compromise of a smaller sharper
screen over a larger one that just isn't
good enough it was funny because when we
did the Amazon video were like yeah this
thing's not great but apparently it's
not the worst whoa good job Jeff
speaking of good job World of Tanks is a
free-to-play multiplayer online game
that lets you master the art of armored
combat it features over
500 war machines from the mid 20th
century including legendary Sherman's
Churchill's Tigers and more they've got

cool shirts like that one and our
community forum which you should totally
