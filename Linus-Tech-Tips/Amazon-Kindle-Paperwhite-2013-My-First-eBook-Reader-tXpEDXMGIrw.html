delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more so I must be the only person on
earth who had never really used a Kindle
before I bought this one consider this a
review not from a seasoned eBook readers
perspective but rather from someone who
has mostly relied on dead trees for the
enjoyment of novels in the past yes I am
just old-fashioned like that I guess
the first thing I notice about the
Kindle was the guaranteed or certified
frustration-free packaging I laughed and
then opened it up inside I found a
charging cable but no wall wart a
QuickStart guide which I didn't really
need because the thing only has a one
button and the Quick Start Guide
basically says push the button and the
paperweight itself
basic specs wise it's got a six inch
ePaper display with a 212 pixels per
inch density 16 levels of grayscale for
maps and illustrations and a blue tinted
brightness adjustable backlight it's got
2 gigs of storage for up to 1,100 books
plus free cloud storage of books on
Amazon if you actually have more than
that
and Amazon figures it'll do about 28
hours of continuous battery life but
with my low back light preference and
slow reading I actually got more out of
it than than that so let's start with
the screen ePaper is really really cool
the screen saver on it which stays on at
all times remember it doesn't take power
to maintain an image only to change it
actually looked like a sticker that was
over top of the screen and I initially
tried to like peel it off before
realizing what a dunce I was being and
turning the thing on the screen does
still have a bit of a yellow cast but
it's much better than other paper
devices that I've seen and really is
more white when it came to benchmarking
um I don't know amazon says it's faster
than the old one or something and I
don't know I still couldn't type my
wireless password at full speed so I
figured what is there to do with this
thing
other than read some books and see if
the actual speed bothers me or doesn't
Bob
me the QuickStart guide made it easy to
get started within about eight minutes
and had walked me through all the
functionality I needed connected me to
my Wi-Fi and I had purchased a book I
decided to skip the whole Facebook and
Twitter integration thing though so
maybe that would have taken a bit more
time and then of course you can't bench
mark without comparative testing so I
read The Hobbit on my iPad - to cleanse
myself of that second movie I read I
hope they serve beer in hell on paper
followed by the first book and about a
third or so of the second one of a song
of fire and ice on the Kindle the higher
display density contrasts sharply with
other readers and significantly reduced
my eye strain compared to my iPad - I
see well close up so smaller font sizes
with fewer page flips is more
comfortable for me as long as the
resolution is high enough that the text
doesn't look distorted and I found the
pixels weren't very noticeable to me
unless I was closer than about four
inches speaking of page flips one thing
that drove me crazy was that referring
back to things like maps or family trees
in a fantasy novel like I was reading
was nearly impossible in very flow
breaking compared to being able to keep
my pinkie in the appropriate appendix
for quick reference or my thumb I'm
willing to trade my appendices however
not my appendix my appendices for the
quick dictionary feature on the other
hand that lets you look things up either
in the dictionary or on Wikipedia and
have it defined for you that is
extremely handy the backlight was also
super convenient I found on a setting of
about four or five
I couldn't tell it was on with the
bedside lamp on in my bedroom but when I
ventured into the darkened house to
retrieve a reading snack the setting was
perfect for that as well so I actually
never really adjusted it now Amazon
touts this as optimal for reading with
one hand but I call bollocks on that it
can be as light as it wants to be but
it's not balanced in portrait the bezel
is so narrow in fact if you look at the
picture on Amazon's website no one can
hold it like that they've got the thumb
like way off to the side here the bezel
is so narrow that you couldn't hope to
actually use it that way unless you're
also resting it on your lap or bed or
something and for right-handed folks
this was really frustrating the only way
it works in landscape mode here we go
is this way with the narrower side in
your right hand most people are
right-handed Amazon Moo is great for the
lefties they have that nice big bezel
that I could actually legitimately call
suitable for one-handed reading but
until Amazon gives you the option to go
either way with landscape mode I I can't
really let that one go I mean I know a
book is heavier but the thing about it
is that it's also inherently balanced
unless you're just starting out or just
finishing it up so I guess that's it
it's not the most complete review I've
ever done but the conclusion isn't
likely to change with more experience
with the product so while it doesn't
compare to holding a book for me and I
think it's the biggest scan ever that
ebooks cost the same as physical books
given their digital distribution cost
savings and the fact that they don't let
people lend them more than once for 14
days which is ridiculous I'll still
probably be continuing to buy books on
Kindle rather than paper your mileage
may vary but the space savings and
convenience of only having one device to
keep track of outweighs the superior
experience of the smell of paper and
turning actual pages for me thank you
