supply that I've had a look at in the
last little while now Moscone is really
coming on strong releasing new power
supplies they really want to get back
into this so let's see what their 1000
watt offering is going to look like so
okay first of all we've got the front of
the box which is standard looks like
they've got they've only changed one
thing like two things on the front of
the box versus the front of the box on
the 700 watt this number is different it
is 1,000 instead of 700 and right here
is an 80 plus gold badge versus the 80
plus bronze that we saw in the 700 watt
let's have a look at the overall specs
for this unit so you can see that it is
capable of providing up to 912 wats on
the 4 12 volt rails combined and up to
900 75 watts so that's a-ok right so our
other 25 watts are on the minus 12 volt
as well as the plus 5 volt plus 5 BSB
rails okay so most of the wattage of the
power supply can be provided from the 12
watt from the 12 volt rail but not close
to all of it like some of the other
units we've seen over the last little
while let's flip this guy over and have
a look at what it's got to say for
itself on the back so they claim a
one-hundred-thousand-dollar mean time
between failure for this one with even
an even higher rating for the thermally
controlled nanotech bearing fan we've
got a plus gold certification with
efficiency up to ninety percent okay and
you start for combo cables with SATA and
peripheral connectors yeah we'll have a
look at the connectors in a minute so
here's the electrical safeguards we've
got over current protection over voltage
protection under voltage protection
short circuit protection over power
protection and under load protection
comes with a 2-year warranty so let's go
ahead and assume my camera here and
let's get this package opened up and
let's have a look at the dual 1000 watt
so it's got a pretty basic overall
packaging thing going on here just a
simple paper sleeve over a plain black
box but let's see what's inside
really counts okay so we have an owner's
manual for muskan enhanced bolta and
dual series power supplies okay there's
some pretty basic stuff there alright
we've got a power cable included nice
thick one some velcro cable ties it
looks like we got four of those included
maybe it's 55 yeah five of those
included you've got some screws as well
as a couple of plastic zip ties and then
we're down to the power supply itself so
not a whole lot in terms of packaging or
accessories in here but ultimately if
you're anything like me you usually
don't worry too much about the packaging
accessories and you are more concerned
about the power supply itself so this is
not a modular unit something to be aware
of unlike the jewel 700 watt this is a
cables connected power supply so let's
look at the actual PSU itself and then
we'll have a closer look at the cables
so it's got a plain black finish on the
sides the top as well as on the other
side where we find a muskan sticker that
outlines the overall specs of the unit
for us once more the front is plain
because all of the cables are
pre-attached to this psu and it is not
modular as I mentioned before there's
your nanotech fan and on the back we
find what we've come to expect from
muskan power supplies and that is a
crosshatch style back and it looks like
it's going to be very very free-flowing
so you shouldn't have any restriction as
far as the air flow goes on the back
here we've got power switch as well as
any power in all right let's see what we
got for cables here now I do prefer
modular power supplies but modular
interfaces do introduce a little bit of
extra resistance so it's possible that
to achieve that 80 plus gold
certification the mush can opted to go
with a fully attached cable design to
make sure that they get that extra
efficiency boost here so we've got a 24
pin power connector it's a nice long
cable on that as well we've got
okay what's this one yeah here we go we
have an 8-pin that is a straight 8 pin
so it's not a 4 plus 4 you can't slide
it apart but that's an 8-pin eps
connector okay i'm going to assume
there's another one of those somewhere
yeah here's one okay so we have another
one of those so you can plug this power
supply into motherboards that like 28
pin connectors like the EVGA classified
or the MSI big bang xpower all right in
terms of PCI Express connectors we've
got a 26 plus two pins and two oh wait
hold on okay so we have yep we have four
six plus two pins so there's two here
and you can just slide these together to
make either six pin or an 8-pin and then
there's two connected to a separate
cable which has escaped from me want you
more whoops sorry there's one more that
had fallen down there so I couldn't see
it we actually have a total of six six
plus two pin connectors so this power
supply is ready for 3-way SLI or freeway
crossfire with cards requiring six and
six six and eight or eight and eight PCI
Express power connectors so there's all
of our EPS pcie alright let's see what
we've got for peripheral connectors here
let's take one of these and see what it
is so this guy is for SATA right there
the next one is for theta so that's up
to eight SATA so far next we've got four
more SATA so that's up to 12 SATA
connections and finally we've got four
molex connectors with a floppy connector
as well just in case you still have
something that requires one of those so
that is the overall unboxing and first
look at the jewel 1000 watt power supply
