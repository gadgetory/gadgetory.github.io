hundred percent serious about the SSD
game for the first time they have an
exclusive unique controller design that
they are shipping in their new Neutron
and neutron GTX lying products so we've
got the neutron GTX here today this is
the 240 gig capacity drive so much like
Sam force drives Corsair is setting
aside about 13% of the total flash
capacity for spare area which allows the
drive to remain keep the performance
higher over time as it fills up with
data as well as just generally behave
more more smoothly it also gives it a
little bit of extra so when cell
eventually and guys there's no avoiding
this the cells do eventually die and
then it can use some of the spare area
to compensate for that over time if you
keep your drive for a very long time so
we have the 240 gig drive this is using
a totally new totally custom controller
so let's go ahead and get this opened up
and have a look at gun great package
here of course there is so good at
packaging shiny red se two three seven
millimeter right don't worry I'll cover
all this stuff in a moment I'm just
trying to figure out how to get it open
here so inside the box we've got let's
see a warranty against defects cool
notification for Australian customers I
must have gotten like an international
temple or something okay we've got one
of those two and a half inch to three
and a half inch adapters we've got
screws for screwing into you know things
such as your system or the adapter okay
there are two sets of screws small ones
for this big ones for this now let's get
into the drive itself so this is using a
link a media LM 87 800 controller it is
a dual core controller dual arm cores
actually with 256 Meg's of fairly fast
fairly fast cache memory are ya can do
second sorry guys brain fart I was
looking for a ddr2 800 cache memory
which is pretty fast compared to some of
the other stuff out there I mean crucial
is using ddr3 but
actually clocked slower so yeah okay so
let's talk about what is when how this
how this came to be so Corsair has
entered into an agreement with link a
medium where they are actually
collaborating and working together on
this controller architecture on this
drive to the point where even both of
them are doing quality control because I
know for a lot of consumers who have
bought SSDs early on in their lifespans
in the past they've been burned with
things like firmware issues or things
like even data crops I mean even Intel
hasn't been free from this micron
crucial had a had a firmware bug that
caused the drives to just stop working
after a set amount of time being powered
on which they then fixed with the
firmware update however both blinky
media and Corsair are doing extensive
validation with this drive and the
firmware update process is extremely
easy and Corsairs estimating anywhere
from about three days to issue a fix for
any kind of firmware bugs that they find
and then from there two weeks to
determine if it breaks anything that was
that wasn't broken by applying the fix
so overall I'm expecting good things I
think Corsair is uh I mean I think we
all know that Corsair is pretty much a
okay when it comes to supporting their
products so I'm very excited to see how
this shapes up over time because as much
as the performance is great announced
the state of 3dr does support trim
maintains reasonable performance over
time even if you hammered really hard
and performs right up there with really
high performance drives like the Intel
520 the vertex 4 as well as the Plextor
m3 Pro even beating them in many cases
I'm really excited to see what is yet to
come from this architecture because
remember it took Intel to really squeeze
the most out of the sand force SATA 3
controller so that took what six months
a year something like that so Corsair
and link' media have a lot of time to
work on this and potentially squeeze
even more out of it and the flash isn't
going to be a bottleneck particularly on
the GTX drive the GTX drive uses toggle
Man which is the fastest op out there
right now and I think that's pretty much
it yeah we've almost wrapped up so
another cool thing about this
it uses a seven millimeter low-profile
you know what I'm actually gonna go snag
another drive just so that I can put
them next to each other here and compare
for you so what that means is that some
of the smaller notebooks are ultra books
these days that are using two and a half
inch drives are lower profile than a
standard drive so you can see here
there's a two millimeter difference
between a 9-mil drive and a seven mil
drive Corsair has done this in order to
enable compatibility no matter what kind
of a device you are installing the drive
in so with the included adapter you can
install it in a three and a half inch
bay a normal two and a half inch bay
using the mounting screws on the bottom
or the mounting screws on the side or
even a slim two and a half inch bay due
to the low profile design of the drive
the state of three chip set of the SATA
three connectors are at the back of the
drive exactly where you'd expect them to
be and other than that I guess all that
remains now is waiting for the NCIX
tek-tips SSD update where we feature
this guy and tell you a little bit about
the performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
