spending excess amounts of money on a
clearly inferior platform well of course
there's h80 igt and h100 I GTX
all-in-one liquid coolers improved both
the appearance and cooling of your PC
click now to learn more all right guys
I'm here with Rafael asking the age-old
question counselor PC PC our contry
counselor PC PC or console console or PC
console or PC PC just used to be console
of a PC obviously PC Kathlyn PC PC PC
console or PC PC definitely that was
really fast PC PC so you're both taking
PC a lot of people have picked EC today
which makes literally no sense why PC
it's amazing you can upgrade it later on
on the road all some more game options
but I think it's better because you
could customize it a hell out more than
a console you don't get to customize
anything yeah I can customize my
PlayStation I can put skins on it make
it look different and it makes it go
faster stripes right yeah it does that's
that's a proven scientific thing
screenshots with I don't get why don't I
need screenshots if I'm going to show my
friends something I'll bring them over I
know the PC players are like not that
social but like I have friends that'll
come to my house they can see my screen
I don't need the screen shop faster
better performance why would you want a
better performance human eye can't see
above 24 fps why do you want more
performance on your front on your PC do
you know what kind of processors in your
xbox a good one well I can tell you that
my 7 quad-core 2600 K that's cool you
just had a whole bunch of numbers that I
don't care but I could have I could have
a jiu-jitsu 4820 Q in my xbox I don't
know what the crap is in my xbox why do
I care well not necessarily because o
Ubisoft at resolution as the god to do
be soft has told us in the past is
literally just a number so there's no
point even bringing out performance in
terms of resolution at all that's why
stuff like watchdogs is running at 792p
on xbox is because whatever that's a
weird number but that's cool who cares
it's just it's fun it resolutions just a
number it is just a number buddy make
everything with nicer thanks everything
I totally don't agree but whatever okay
so you're saying that FES doesn't matter
it doesn't close your eye Oh FES does
matter you don't want it to be too high
all too high your eye is a problem it's
like golf scores when it comes to FBS
would you rather have 120 or Lord of the
Rings has proven to us that 48 verses 24
24 wins I went to go see the Hobbit in
both different frame rates 24 FPS was
better so why would I want more I think
we can both agree that the Hobbit wasn't
that great of a memory anyway okay -
shame everything about PC just blows for
consoles out of the water for example
like its cost
you just enjoy money leaving your wallet
for no good reason
yes you guys are overkill PC so you
obviously spend way too much money on
your PC personally but we have like 700
pcs that run just as good as an expo
action better you might as well just
throw out the window because it sucks
you're talking about your computer your
console I would never you know the
difference between good and bad yep I'm
good consoles are good you're bad pcs
are bad my playstation is pretty small
how big is your computer valid point
mm-hmm right Linus doing a video whose
lining Linus he's uh just like when
you're weird gods or something yeah sort
of really I mean I worship my my I pray
them every night I know you guys like
worship gaben and this line is stewed
and stuff like we don't have these weird
cults we can just enjoy gaming without
worshiping and spending our time
fantasizing over these weird figures
these short little people so there's a
lot of really cool exclusives on
consoles why would you go to PC
flexibility if I can build Lex ability
to not have cool exclusives yep I don't
know titanfall destiny which you don't
have halo which you don't have
Last of Us which you don't have GTA
which you sorry do you have GTA oh you
guys don't have gta5
that's really interesting I've had this
game for a year and a half seriously you
guys don't have it yet yeah so ain't I
gotta say about that but I've already
played it on console so he's secretly on
my side I've already converted one even
I feel kind of bad it's like like at
first I'm like ah man I just lay these
PC people and now I'm just like oh yeah
yeah I mean I have an Xbox one for one
and I play it once in a while okay next
up is John now John PC or console
console console okay do you just hate
graphics or what's up with that no the
human eye can't see over 24 FPS where
did you get the information on human eye
can't see over 24 fps Wikipedia oh
that's a very credible source are all
your friends also console putz yes do
you hate resolution as well as FPS or is
that like a one-dimensional thing I
don't know I stopped a upgrading off to
for a AP TV I've got big true oh so do
you have a modern console with a tube TV
yeah I've got an Xbox one well if a game
costs less than 45 pounds then it's
probably not worth playing okay got to
pay for gold if you want to be able to
play online do you pay for gold is that
something you enjoy doing yeah my mom
pays for it your mom pays for gold okay
