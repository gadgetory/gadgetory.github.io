brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital Nvidia is starting
things off on a strong note when you
walk into their booth the first thing
you're gonna see is three 4k TVs running
an NVIDIA surround powered by four GTX
Titans running an nvidia sli and you are
going to see project cars a game being
played by real people so this is not
some kind of you know random tech demo
or anything like that running at a very
smooth frame rate speaking of smooth
frame rate if you look up above me you
can see right there
for case around gaming at 1.5 billion
pixels per second NVIDIA has got tons of
stuff they're demoing here game stream
with shield is obviously a big thing we
went in the back room when we checked
out Tegra k1 they've got some amazing
demos running with face works as well as
with Unreal Engine I mean it's a truly
DirectX 11 point 2 opengl 4.4 compatible
graphics chip using kepler the kepler
architecture inside a mobile form factor
so that was super amazing but really I
mean if you guys have heard me talk
about g-sync lately you'll know how
excited I am about it and there was some
misconception floating around that
g-sync was only gonna support 1080p TN
panels but that's totally untrue they've
actually got a wide variety of different
partner solutions most of which will be
coming out this year with support for
g-sync but the one that really grabbed
my attention is the pre-production one
here at the end of the line so they've
got two Asus 4k monitors running here
one of them's got their pendulum g-sync
demo and that's interesting but we've
seen that before I wanted to show you
guys the real world demo because
normally you can't really demo g-sync on
video but in this case they've actually
found a game that in a real world
scenario demos it incredibly well so
they've built a little app that cycles
between the different sync modes so you
just press page up and right now we're
running in vsync mode so you can see
we're here over the water fraps is
giving us a clean 60 FPS and everything
runs butter smooth now as soon as we
yeah there it is as soon as we go over a
populated area it starts to really
stutter because it's dry
bring down to 30fps due to the variance
in how quickly the GPU can process these
easy frames versus those more difficult
ones now we're gonna go ahead and press
the button again and I believe this is
gonna drop us it yeah there we go so
we're up at around 78 FPS over the water
still looks very very smooth over the
water where we can maintain that
framerate but what happens when we go
over that say oh look at that vertical
tearing alright one more time here one
more time here okay so where the water
smooth smooth all that tearing very very
very or awesome very awesome kay you can
see it like sweeping back and forth so
that's what happens with vsync
completely off now here's the last
example with g-sync
we're not gonna see any lag and we're
not going to see any tearing the little
green dot 60fps over the water nice and
buttery smooth passing over the land oh
wow look at that nice and smooth because
instead of dropping down to 30fps we
were able to drop down to any frame per
second because g-sync lets the graphics
card control the refresh rate of the
monitor so if it's running at 42 frames
per second that monitor is running at 42
refreshes per second very very cool guys
don't miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
big thanks to NCI XCOM for allowing us
to be here at the show remember they're
your source for great technology
selection and service we have a couple
of other sponsors Corsair memory as well
as Western Digital huge thanks to them
as well because without them it wouldn't
be possible for us to be here bringing
