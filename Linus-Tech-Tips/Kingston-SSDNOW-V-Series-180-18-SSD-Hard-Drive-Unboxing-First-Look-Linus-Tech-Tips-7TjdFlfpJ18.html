series this is a v+ drive and it is the
180 so you might ask you know what's up
with an arbitrary number like 180 well I
would postulate that it stands for 1.8
inch so you can see that this SSD is
actually substantially smaller than
other SSDs in the SSD now v+ series and
the reason for that is that not every
device out there uses two and a half
inch drives what a concept
some subnotebooks and even other devices
actually require you to have a 1.8 inch
drive if you want upgrade and kingston
is not going to leave behind any part of
the market that they can meet and given
that SSD technology is very easily
shrunk down to smaller sizes well hey
why not produce a 100 1.8 inch drive I'm
not a big fan of the whole plastic
clamshell packaging but it's not too
hard to get apart so let's see what
Kingston has to say for themselves in
the documentation here kind of clever
the way they do their manuals you just
kind of take apart the packaging and
then BOOM there's your getting started
guide so 1.8 inch drive something to be
aware of is if you're upgrading a
notebook for example that comes with a
1.8 inch drive you might be in for a bit
of a treat getting things apart they
don't actually say much in here about
that they're just talking about the
physical installation make sure you got
to say to the interface and a SATA cable
make sure your configure your BIOS to
boot from the SSD all of that good stuff
this guy is about staying up-to-date on
Kingston technology news and products ok
challenge first of all interface ok this
is not a standard SATA desktop interface
so I want you to look at a standard
desktop drive so we're gonna orient
these guys the same way these are
clearly not the same it actually is a
proprietary well not proprietary it is a
standard connector but it's a different
standard connector on a 1.8 inch drive
versus a two and a half inch drive
because you can clearly see that this
drive just isn't wide enough to fit all
that stuff on with the necessary
reinforcements and structural bits that
need to go along with it
so that's the reason for the different
interface now the other thing to be
aware of is that taking apart a drive or
a computer or an appliance or whatever
else you have that is designed to accept
this kind of a drive might be a bit of a
challenge because they're usually highly
embedded highly proprietary and then
you're gonna require probably a set of
torque screw drivers as well as some
other special stuff as well now just in
terms of sheer size I want to show you a
three and a half inch desktop hard drive
so you hold that up to a computer it
looks pretty small looks pretty normal
this is what a hard drive looks like
okay two and a half inch drives these
are basically gonna replace three and a
half inch drives in the next couple
years as far as I can tell they're about
one-quarter the size of a three and a
half inch drive so you take that you put
it on top you can see that we could
easily fit two side-by-side you take
that and put it on the side and you can
see that we could easily stack two so
you actually have some adapters for
example three and a half inch to two and
a half inch adapters that you can mount
in a case that will just take two SSDs
and mount them in the sandwich form
right directly on top of each other so
you can fit double the density and then
I've even seen five and a quarter inch
bay adapters that allow you to hot swap
for two and a half inch drives in the
space of one of those so everything's
getting more miniature all the time but
this just really takes the cake this
thing is just tiny compared to a two and
a half inch drive you've got about half
the thickness so here I'm gonna give you
that angle so you can see it pretty well
even less than actually oh no that's
probably about half the thickness of the
two and a half inch drive although it's
not quite the same proportion so it's
not a one to four ratio like the two and
a half to three and a half so you can
see the interface makes it just a little
bit too long to actually fit four of
these in the same space but there you
have it Kingston produces a full range
of SSD products including two and a half
inch as well as 1.8 inch drives and
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the Kingston SSDs now V+ a 180 that
is a 64 gig very very very small you
okay here's a good comparison Oh hold on
pause so just for size comparison this
is a crazy Russians credit card which he
thoughtfully loaned to me so that I
could show you guys how big this 1.8
inch drive is compared to a credit card
so you can see it is actually smaller
than a credit card
so hey if you got an encrypted one of
these you could actually like carry it
around in your wallet remember this is
the encrypted drive this one's not
encrypted is just really small so there
you have it that is the 1.8 inch drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
