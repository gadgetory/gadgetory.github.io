delivering it this is our very first
value oriented system build guide and
our very first AMD build guide so we're
going to be going through the usual
stuff so that is best practices when
choosing your components best practices
when building your system and of course
because we're going with an APU from AMD
we're going to explain some of the
benefits of an APU versus a more
traditional CPU as always our
configuration starts at the heart with
the CPU actually this is an APU so a
traditional CPU has general processing
cores built into it that communicate
with your system memory and do most of
the things that your PC needs to do now
over time this has begun to change and
what an APU does is it integrates Radeon
graphics course and what AMD is really
calling DirectX 11 discrete grade
graphics into what would normally be a
traditional CPU so in addition to the
four traditional CPU cores in here we've
got a bunch of Radeon course that are
great for running games and for other
applications as well so for example
rather than just being good for games
integrated graphics can now be used to
accelerate OpenCL compatible
applications and in the transition
towards HSA or heterogeneous system
architecture which is a way of saying
that all of the processors are not going
to be differentiated the same way that
they used to so okay well this is a CPU
and this does this and this is a GPU and
this does that instead they'll be able
to work together to reach a goal at the
same time rather than you know say for
example waiting around for each other to
do work until it becomes their turn to
work on the same task it's going to
amount to better performance for your
system overall although it was a little
bit complicated to get the whole thing
going because we needed a hardware
support and software support and it's
all going to kind of happen at the same
time now for our system we chose the a
1060 790 K which is a new model we chose
this because of its great balance
between price and performance and the
fact that it includes very powerful
Radeon graphics so lower end ap use will
tend to have less powerful graphics in
addition to less powerful CPU cores so
for some of the OpenCL demos that we're
going to show you this is going to be
quite important for your APU system you
may find some other very interesting
choices with either lower prices or even
better performance than this one so
don't feel like this is the only option
it's just what we went with to demo this
platform for memory our usual
considerations pretty much come down to
well the size how much ram we need and
then how many channels we need it to run
it whether it's dual triple or quad
however for an APU there are some
special considerations speed becomes
much more important because graphics
course that is the the Radeon course
built into the APU require higher
bandwidth for optimal performance than
traditional CPU cores do so we went with
a gigs of AMD's Radeon series memory in
a dual channel configuration for our
value optimized config but another
option if we were willing to sacrifice
some performance particularly in gaming
and OpenCL applications now for better
upgrade ability in the future would be
to get a single eight gig stick and then
throw another eight gig stick in later
on down the line and run it in dual
channel then because our motherboard
only has two slots now why did we go
with AMD memory frankly there is no
difference in terms of performance
between AMD memory and some other memory
that's running at pretty much the same
speed and timings the key difference
here is compatibility because AMD is the
one building the memory controller
that's on the chip itself and they're
the ones validating the memory for it
you know that it's going to work with
that said there are many other reliable
memory brands out there and if you buy
something from you know Kingston or
Corsair or whoever else there's I mean
there's a very very slim chance that
it's not going to work it's just what
you're comfortable with they have
several series of memory including their
entertainment performance and gamer
series modules and you can find a
capacity and speed that's going to work
for you pretty much regardless of your
needs and your budget we went with a
very value oriented option for our
motherboard in order to demonstrate the
potential well cost-effectiveness of an
APU based system with some of the lower
cost ap use and
the board like this if you don't need or
want much in the way of expansion and
you just want performance for your
dollar it's pretty hard to beat it I
mean this one right here this is the FM
to a 55 MD GSR 2.0 from asrock doesn't
have many frills it doesn't even have
USB 3 for example but it only costs
about 50 bucks you can take small steps
up in terms of features and robustness
you can add USB 3 here in better audio
there all the way to fully featured
gaming grade boards like this one but I
guess the point of all this is that the
choice is up to you so this is a g1
sniper a 88 X it's a fully overclocking
ready gaming ready crossfire supporting
motherboard on the FM 2 plus socket
which is going to have support for
upcoming Kaveri ap use and so everything
in between this and this totally exists
so let's be clear about the power supply
in case choices we made here there are
much less expensive options you can
spend about a third of what we did on a
case that has a bundled power supply
that will fit all this stuff and it'll
probably work just fine at least in the
short term it's just that that's not
necessarily the only way to go about it
so we wanted to show off what you can
get in terms of a case with great
ventilation great compactness and very
reasonable build quality for about 40
bucks with the fractal design core 1000
but ultimately the choice will be up to
you with a value oriented build a lot of
the time the difference between 20 bucks
and 40 bucks is a lot so it'll come down
to whether you're going to be doing any
upgrading in the future and you want
that expand ability whether it's worth
the additional investment as for the
standalone power supply you versus using
the bundled power supply that might come
with a case we never recommend using
that bundled power supply even if it
came with your case throw it away and
get a real power supply you never know
what's inside them and just because it
says 400 watts on the outside doesn't
mean that it's actually capable of
outputting 400 watts only use bundled
power supplies if they're from a
reputable brand like an Tek for example
for our PSU we went with a see sonic 400
watt OAM unit see sonic is great they
build quiet reliable power supplies and
are often available for less than other
brands this one right here has nothing
special about it on the outside with non
sleeved cables and like an ugly metal
housing
but it's like the Millennium Falcon it's
got it where it counts nice quiet 120
millimeter fan nice solid weight to it
which is usually a good sign for a power
supply because it means there's actual
components and side verses it just being
a metal box and of course 80 plus bronze
efficiency is still something we care
about because it can be an indicator of
the quality of the components inside
storage is always a tricky one for us to
talk about and there are a couple of
options here so for 60 bucks you can get
a WD blue one terabyte drive which has
mediocre performance and decent capacity
is one terabyte but you could also spend
a bit more and get something else so you
can either get a WD black one terabyte
which will give you better performance
and still good capacity or you can get a
kingston v300 120 gig SSD if you don't
mind planning for a quick upgrade to
your storage because that will give you
lightning-fast performance but only a
hundred and twenty gigs of storage which
isn't going to be enough for you know
massive video collections or a bunch of
games or anything like that
so we opted for the Blu drive just
because we wanted this to be a pretty
inexpensive rig but I wanted to talk
about those other options as well
talking about graphics with the computer
like this is another tough one because
we set out to build a good all-round
performer and to do an APU build guide
here and because an APU has decent
onboard graphics there's no compelling
reason to add a dedicated graphics card
unless we were serious about gaming now
if we were serious about gaming there
are some fantastic options out there in
terms of graphics so for example we've
got the r7 260x that is fully supported
by our motherboard by our power supply
and by our case thank goodness for
custom rigs right the actual ability to
be able to upgrade them is awesome and
adding something like this will take our
gaming experience to the next level
there are however a couple of reasons I
can think of to go with an APU out of
the gate even if you do intend to
upgrade to a graphics card later because
remember guys there are AMD CPUs on the
FMX platform that are a little bit less
expensive so if you put a graphics card
right in you might not want to do that
okay so number one reason is maybe
you're not sure how much you're going to
gain the APU this one right here will
handle battlefield 4 at 720p with medium
details so at least this gives you the
opportunity to play it and make a
decision later on down the road about
whether or not you want to have a
graphics card and it is less expensive
to go for an APU versus a CPU than it is
to just buy the graphics card outright
number two is maybe you just plain-old
don't have the budget right now with an
APU you can get the system up and
running and decide later so that's tied
in very closely to reason number one
reason number three is maybe the gaming
aspect of a PC just isn't even for you
you can still benefit from the APU from
a computer spective more on that later
and the system will at least be capable
of having a little bit of umph when you
know the grandkids come to stay for the
weekend and they bring a couple of their
games with them for example the last
thing you want is a situation where it
just flat-out doesn't run the APU is not
going to give you nearly the gaming
experience as a dedicated graphics card
like this but at least it brings the
system to width in gaming capability
range without costing a whole lot more
on to our peripherals choices we went
with the age to 36 lb ID for our monitor
and the MK 124 our keyboard and mouse I
mean the logitech MK 120 is nothing
special it's very inexpensive but a
cheap mouse and keyboard we can kind of
live with especially if we're not gaming
and especially when you consider how
much more you really need to spend to
get a great keyboard and mouse so we'd
be spending probably another you know
10% of our total budget on something
like a K 30 from Corsair and an m40 from
Corsair which would deliver a great
gaming experience and actually most of
the performance of even higher cost
solutions than those ones but just is a
little bit more than we're willing to
spend if we're not gaming about now if
you're serious about gaming and you do
opt for the GPU upgrade for example then
maybe you can add something like that
later on down the road for the monitor
though I really believe that you should
purchase a monitor more like a piece of
furniture everyone benefits from a
better monitor it
less fatiguing on your eyes and things
just plain look better they look like
the content creator wanted them to look
like but the great thing about monitors
is that unlike something like a graphics
card where you buy it now and it runs
all the games really great and then two
years down the road it doesn't run
anything very well anymore a monitor
performs as well as it does pretty much
throughout its lifetime so if you buy a
good monitor you'll be looking at a good
image five years from now and if you buy
a lousy monitor you'll still be looking
at a lousy monitor five years from now
so we went with an IPS monitor because
the experience is so much better it
looks better and it really just doesn't
cost that much more when you consider
how long you might keep it but this is a
very personal thing look at your desk
how long have you had that monitor if
it's more than three to five years and
it's lived through a couple of full
system upgrades and you skimped last
time maybe think about getting something
a little nicer for yourself this time
around on the other hand if it doesn't
bother you at all then that's great but
I personally find it very frustrating
particularly with for example low-end TN
panels when you're in something like an
email application even and the red
versus unread messages are difficult to
distinguish from each other
because you can't tell the difference
between pale yellow and white that
drives me crazy and a better monitor
makes that a non-issue for our OS
Windows 8 is the obvious choice for a
machine like this because it actually
provides better performance on an APU
versus Windows 7 this is getting fairly
well-documented and I'm interested to
see how things continue to progress in
this direction in the future well it's
time for the actual building now so
start with a safe static free
workstation as always an anti-static
strap I like to keep mine on my ankle to
keep it out of the way because I find
when it's on my wrist it just get caught
on things and I'm more likely to make a
mistake and then beyond that all we
really need for assembly is a multi-bit
screwdriver now I always recommend
building the system outside of the case
to ensure that there are no issues with
something getting shorted out and to
make sure that everything is already
working before it's all jammed into a
case and it's difficult to swap things
in and out
troubleshoot it the motherboard box
makes for a very handy non conductive
test bench however this is a very very
common mistake don't use the anti-static
bag that's on the outside of your
motherboard on top of the box okay once
the power is actually applied to the
board some of these bags have conductive
outer coatings and can actually short
out the board if it's powered on so guys
just to be very very very clear when the
board is not powered on on top of static
bag okay when the board is powered on on
top of rather on top of anti-static bag
not optimal I would rather have it on
something like a piece of cardboard like
the top of the box so we're going to
start with CPU installation first
carefully remove the CPU and heatsink
from the box the pins on the CPU are
extremely fragile AMD has the pins on
the processor not in the socket versus
their competitor so we're going to leave
the CPU inside the plastic shell while
we determine the correct orientation
next we're going to lift up the
retention arm on the socket then align
the small golden triangle on the corner
of the CPU with the small plastic
triangle on the corner of the socket
finally we're going to place the CPU
down onto the socket until it falls in
on its own we don't push the CPU into
the socket with any kind of force just
give it a little wiggle to make sure
it's in there okay and once that's done
you can lower the retention arm and your
CPU is installed in the socket just a
couple things to consider when you're
putting the heatsink down on the CPU
number one is to make sure that the
metal clips on either side of the
heatsink are positioned correctly to
hook over the bracket around the CPU
socket and number two is make sure your
fan wire is as close as possible to the
CPU fan header that is usually labeled
on your motherboard so first now that
it's in position is to take the clip
that's on the side that does not have a
plastic arm on the heatsink and put it
over the bracket around the CPU socket
then turn it around and this metal clip
does have a plastic retention arm so
we're going to go ahead and put the
metal clip on to the CPU bracket then
take the arm and turn it pretty much a
full 180 degrees this requires a little
bit of force until it locks into place
finally guys take your fan wire and I
recommend twisting it up a little bit
here so that the wires don't spread out
and get into the way of everything and
then plug that into the fan header which
should be again clearly labeled now
please note guys that I recommend better
CPU cooling than the Box cooler that's
included if your objective is to have an
extremely silent computer or to run
beyond stock speeds by overclocking your
processor neither of those things are
very appropriate with our config here
and a better motherboard would be
required in addition to better cooling
to make that possible
ddr3 installation is simple especially
in a motherboard that only has two slots
so you don't have to worry about which
ones are right for a dual channel
operation or color coding or anything
like that all you do is take the modules
and align the notch in the module with
the little notch in the socket open up
the clips position the module on the
socket then push down firmly on both
sides it should be noted guys that we're
installing gamer edition memory from AMD
and we had talked about using more value
optimized memory in this system don't
worry the way high-end memory works is
it's just rated at being able to operate
at a higher speed but we're going to be
doing for our performance numbers later
on in the video is turning it down
manually to simulate what you'd be able
to get with entertainment class modules
hey now we're ready to start putting
stuff in the case so first we're going
to remove the two side panels by using
the handy-dandy thumb screws that come
included on this case then we're going
to take those side panels and put them
somewhere safe where they're not going
to get lost
speaking of keeping things safe and not
losing them a really handy trick that I
use all the time is when you take out a
screw put it back where you got it
so that you're not going to lose it so
all those thumb screws can go back into
the case once we've taken off the side
panels just don't get confused when
you're trying to put the side panel back
on you're going like oh why does it fit
back on oh there's a thumb screw in the
way so I've definitely done that before
next thing just another sanity check
type item
is take your i/o shield and make sure
that it matches the motherboard and that
it is oriented correctly before you go
ahead and install it into the back of
the case by aligning it and then firmly
pushing in all four corners until it is
poking through a little bit and sits in
place without falling out so the thing
about a power supply with no packaging
is that it doesn't have any screws
included or anything like that don't
worry guys it doesn't matter in spite of
the fact that the handy dandy box full
of mounting hardware that comes with
your case doesn't list power supply
screws on the back of it they are indeed
included and they look a little
something like this
the next step is to take your power
supply and decide on the orientation
when you put it in the kit oh wait note
because we have a top mounted power
supply in this case we only have one
orientation that it goes in with you can
actually see that there's only one set
of screw holes so the reason for that is
that while on a bottom mounted power
supply case you can decide to pull air
away from your graphics card area or to
pull air through what is normally a
filtered intake on the bottom of the
case with a top mounted case if we flip
this power supply around it would have
nowhere to draw air from because the top
of the case is completely solid so it's
for the safety of the power supply
itself that it only has one option
another handy thing about this
orientation is that our cables are now
at the back of the chassis where it's a
little bit easier to route them and
manage them behind the motherboard tray
so all that's left is to slide it into
position and then do up the four screws
that we pulled out of that unlabeled box
and that's pretty much it the power
supply is in to install the motherboard
in our case we're going to need the
little brass standoffs as well as the
little black screws with the tight
threads on them that are required to
actually secure the motherboard to the
standoffs now before you put the
standoffs onto the motherboard tray in
the case you're going to want to make
sure you're putting them in the right
place because there are some options
depending on the kind of motherboard you
have so we have a full length M ATX
board but it is narrow so we only
actually require six standoffs all we
got to do is hold the motherboard up and
we can see which holes the motherboard
standoffs need to go into so once we've
determined that there are a couple of
different ways to install them
number one is if you happen to have one
of these handy-dandy little screwdrivers
you can go ahead and install them with
one of those but unfortunately this case
it doesn't come with one of them the
other option is to install them by hand
and then tighten them the last little
bit with a pair of pliers or something
along those lines
once all the standoffs are in carefully
position the motherboard over them but
not touching them because you don't want
to scratch the back of it
I usually hold the motherboard by the
heatsink itself because it gives me
something firm to grip onto that won't
damage anything then inserting at an
angle to ensure that we're not scraping
the board across the standoffs as we put
it in we go ahead and put the IO through
the back of the case then lay it down
flat and put in at least one screw right
away so that the board's not going to
slip anywhere and slide around all over
the place again we don't want to damage
it finally finish up by installing all
six of the screws that secure the board
in place and that's pretty much it your
motherboard is now installed with the
motherboard physically installed now
it's time to install all the wires and
cables and connections because this is
the point in the build where it's
easiest to get at them all so we're
going to start with the 24 pin connector
this is the large thick connector with
well 24 pins it only goes in one way so
if it doesn't seem like it's fitting
turn that baby around and put her in
followed by the what would normally be a
pin connector on a high-end board but
this board really doesn't need that much
power for the CPU it's very efficient so
we can break away 4 of the pins and we
plug in the 4 pin connector above the
CPU socket here that is followed by the
front panel connectors so this is our
power switch our reset switch our power
LED and then our drive indicator LED the
power switch and reset switch the
orientation is not important as long as
you get them on the correct pins which
are often labeled on the board but if
not you can check out the motherboard
manual that's in the Box where as the
power LED and the drive activity LED the
orientation does matter so make sure
that the colored wires correspond to the
positive pins on the motherboard the
last one is the speaker this one the
orientation is important as well so same
thing colored wire to positive terminal
and if you get any of those wrong in the
first place in the lights or the speaker
don't seem to be working don't worry
about it just flip them around it's not
going to damage
anything next up we've got our front USB
this case supports a single front USB 3
connector but unfortunately our board
doesn't so we weren't able to plug that
one in but it does support front USB 2
so we just want to note where the pin is
missing on the connector where the pin
is missing on the header and then go
ahead and plug that in front panel audio
is installed in much the same way
there's a missing pin in the brick and a
missing pin on the board just like that
you go ahead and plug that in and you're
pretty much ready to rock the last thing
now is the fan so there's a front fan in
this case that gives us positive airflow
inside or probably about neutral when
you factor in that the power supply is
going to be exhausting some air as well
which is lots of airflow as long as
we're running you know integrated
graphics or a low-end graphics card
otherwise I would recommend installing
maybe a rear exhaust fan or something
like that but since we don't have a rear
exhaust fan we're going to use that
space right there to manage some of our
wires so because there's no room on the
back of the motherboard tray on this
case for cable management we are going
to just kind of secure these wires to
each other most important of all is
getting them out of the way of the CPU
socket area and the vrm area which is
that area to the left of the socket so
that you don't have any overheating in
those areas and then making sure there's
a little bit of clearance between them
and the power supply so that there's no
interference with the airflow that needs
to happen there and then finally we're
going to do a little bit of you know
strapping together of these wires at the
front to make sure that that front fan
has an unobstructed airflow path to the
inside of the case for the hard drives
we need very specific screws ones that
have threads on part of them and then
just a straight part that actually goes
through the rubber grommets that are
pre-installed in the hard drive mounting
plate that is positioned vertically in
kind of a unique way so you can either
put two three and a half inch drives on
the rubber mounts or you can position
three two and a half inch drives such as
SSDs if you space them out correctly and
you don't already have a three and a
half inch drive installed otherwise you
can do one three and a half inch and one
two and a half inch it should be noted
that there's also a converter up in one
of the five and a quarter inch bays that
can support either three and a half or
two and a half inch drives now one of
the things I like
about these cases how clever the
harddrive mounting system is most people
buying a $40 case don't need half a
dozen hard drives so it's designed to
not only well be targeted towards the
right people yeah they're probably just
going to have a couple drives but also
deliver a great experience for those
people by allowing much more airflow
over the drives in order to keep them
very very cool compared to most cases in
this price bracket which are just going
to have your typical standard hard drive
cage in the entire front of the case
that really obstructs air flow a lot so
it's a it's a smart design that I quite
like now in terms of actually hooking up
the drive once we've screwed it into the
plate we've just got our single three
and a half inch drive we're going to run
a SATA cable directly from the
motherboard over to the hard drive
there's not a whole lot of cable
management to be done given we've only
got one drive then we're going to run a
SATA power cable from our power supply
down to the drive and then we'll do a
little bit of cable management with them
to get them mostly out of the way and
that's it
now I can't emphasize enough how
optional this particular step is it's
more the kind of thing where after you
build the system if you realize it's
time for a graphics card go ahead and do
this so all you got to do to install a
graphics card again because this case
and power supply and motherboard all
support this kind of an upgrade is pull
out the top two PCI slot covers by just
uninstalling the two thumb screws then
position the graphics card in this case
it's an r7 260x
over the PCI Express slot that's a 16x
slot push down firmly until it locks
into place then screw the two thumb
screws back into place and finally plug
the PCI Express power cable into the
back of the card now you will have noted
probably that this card only has a
single 6 pin PCI Express connector
required in order for it to function but
because this 400 watt power supply is a
good quality one and comes with two six
plus two pin PCI Express connectors we
could actually go ahead and install even
much higher end cards without any
difficulty because we have that
flexibility that we built into our
initial system with the side panels back
in place our system is pretty much ready
to beat well fire it up but there's
still some software stuff that we
going to have to do so we'll start with
BIOS configuration go ahead and mash on
delete to get into the BIOS and there's
a couple things to double-check so let's
make sure that AHCI mode is enabled for
our SATA ports and also ensure that our
components are all detected and our
memory is running at the correct speed
in this case we're simulating ddr3 1600
because that's sort of what would fit
within our budget
next up Windows installation is a snap
if you know how don't worry about the
lack of a disk drive in this machine
installing off of a USB is as simple as
finding a friend with an optical drive
copying all the files directly off your
disk onto your USB Drive and then
throwing that into the system booting
from it and you're ready to install in a
simple system like this there's only one
drive to install windows to so it's
pretty much click click click click
click name your PC click click click
click and you're done the system will
automatically reboot a couple times and
you'll be dumped at the desktop now
drivers are something that many people
struggle with once we're at the Windows
desktop but it's not too overwhelming if
you break it down even devices that
already have drivers installed
automatically from windows update I
would still recommend checking the to
make sure you have the latest ones from
the manufacturer or website as Rox
website should have the latest AMD
chipset drivers LAN drivers and sound
drivers but it's never a bad idea to
double check by going directly to AMD
site real tech site or whoever else is
the actual manufacturer of the chip of
the component that's on your motherboard
if you're having trouble finding a
driver for something here's a trick that
I use go to device manager right-click
the component in question then go to
details and use the drop down box to go
to hardware ID Google the ven underscore
number de Vie underscore number string
and it will usually tell you exactly
what it is and often there's a link to
where to download the driver so the
conclusion of this video is not so much
about the system but more about the
future of the apu on the desktop moving
forward okay so AMD's made it very clear
that apu is sticking around and the
evidence is starting to really increase
to indicate that we don't necessarily
need the best CPUs to have a great
computing experience if we can augment
it in
other ways so let's have a look at how
our system actually performs starting
with gaming in battlefield 4 at 720p
with medium details it's as advertised
it works it's playable and of course we
can add our 260x graphics card to it and
all of a sudden it's a great 1080p
capable gaming machine but at least it
functions out of the box other
applications that can take advantage of
the GPU that is built onto the CPU the
APU so to speak are things like WinZip
or batch filter processing scripts for
Photoshop for example these were able to
perform much better with the apu using
OpenCL acceleration versus just relying
on the cpu all of this sounds
particularly awesome and promising when
we compare it to other options available
in the market like older pcs that are
not able to leverage their GPU compute
in order to improve performance or
things like gaming consoles that are a
little bit locked down in terms of their
functionality the value of a value PC I
guess we call it value PC but we don't
often think about it that way is you
know the additional functionality web
browsing a vast number of supported apps
upgrade ability and all the things that
we can change about the way we use it in
the future
speaking of the future Andy's got some
pretty exciting things coming for the
APU platform including support for true
audio better graphics and compute
performance with their upcoming Kaveri
ap use and the continuing evolution of
the processor technology that's on them
towards HSA which is the equivalent of
having your CPU and GPU working together
on a Google Doc at the same time to get
work done versus them like making
revisions to a word document and then
emailing it back and forth to each other
than waiting for replies I know I
actually already talked a little bit
about HSA earlier in the video but they
wanted me to use that analogy but I
liked my construction versus growing one
better so I compromised by putting them
both in whichever works best for you
let me know in the comments and until
next time peace out guys and don't
forget to subscribe here some glam
footage of our value Andy APU system
really hope you guys enjoyed the video
like it if you liked it dislike it if
you dislike it leave a comment if you
know
things really compels you to leave a
comment and as always don't forget
subscribe I think I already said that
but I'm just basically buying time here
please guys check out some little band
footage of the system yeah I'm now
