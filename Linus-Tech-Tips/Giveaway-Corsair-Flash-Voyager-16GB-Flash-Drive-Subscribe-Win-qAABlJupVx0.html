with something very exciting to announce
we have another giveaway that we're
going to be doing so you can win a
Corsair Flash Voyager 16 gigabyte USB
thumb drive okay there's the flash
voyager it has a nice rubberized grip ii
coating on the outside so that you won't
drop it and it also has a ring to attach
it to your keychain okay then on the
back it has some information like about
the five-year warranty I think it's five
years ten years ten year warranty also
it's durable shockproof plug and play
and windows compatible excellent okay so
you can win a thumb drive all you have
to do is you have to subscribe to both
of my YouTube channels so the first one
is here this is Linus tech tips that's
my name Linus and it's about tech and
sometimes I give a tip or two so you
should subscribe to that one with the
big yellow button right there and then
you should also subscribe to my other
channel this is NCIX tech tips which
also has a big yellow button about
subscribing you can see the video that
would be playing if I press the play
button is about the NCIX
Esther's Easter extravaganza promotion
that we're running right now so that's
pretty cool
subscribe to both of those this week and
so it does Monday the 1st of March today
and if I knew how to operate a Mac then
that would be a miracle Cielo
okay Mac's are stupid look at this okay
there no I finally came up okay so I
click the thing I go to open the date
and time now it finally comes up see
Mac's are slow too
I'm just kidding I don't know if Mac's
are stupid and low but I like PC and I
don't when I try to use the camera man's
Mac it just it always ends up being a
disaster like this this is brutal you
move the mouse to the corner and it just
wrecks everything it moves all your
stuff all over the place very confusing
anyway we're gonna do the draw next week
so that means you have until then to
subscribe to both channels you have to
be in both channels if you want to win
and last time we did a giveaway we said
it's for North America only we're
scrapping that completely because
everyone hated it so we are going to be
doing worldwide for this one but if you
are outside of North America it's
possible you'll have to chip in for the
shipping for us so thank you for
checking out my video blog and don't
forget
subscribe and win</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
