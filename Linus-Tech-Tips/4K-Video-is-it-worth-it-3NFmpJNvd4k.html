metric ass ton of work I mean not for me
mind you ed did all the heavy lifting so
make sure that you show him some love by
liking the video or following him on
Twitter or something because his
findings are absolutely fascinating if
you consume or create video content on
the web welcome to 4k better video
quality or a big fat placebo
Intel's bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their all-new core i7 6700 K and
Core i5 6600 K processors check out the
link in the video description to learn
more so its investigation into 4k video
quality was actually inspired by a
Panasonic camera known as the gh4 at a
mere two thousand dollars trust me that
was amazing when it came out the gh4
could shoot 4k to an internal SD card at
a bit rate of 100 megabit per second you
can learn more about bitrate and why
it's important here which for the first
time put 4k video production like pro
grain production in the hands of regular
consumers who happen to be in the market
for what is also a fairly capable
mirrorless stills camera ballin right we
sure thought so we picked one up pretty
much right away and the vast majority of
our b-roll has been shot on the gh4 for
months with us going as far at one point
as to shoot 4k on our a cam a sony fs7
hundred 4k on our B cam the gh4 and edit
on a 4k timeline with a native export of
4k video that we upload but this proved
to be very challenging at the time the
FS 700 s high bitrate 4k footage was a
total bear to work with the file sizes
were huge putting significant strain on
our networking infrastructure when
multiple editors were working at the
same time and we experienced other
workflow interruptions ranging from poor
editing timeline scrubbing
responsiveness to annoying file
splitting during long clip recording to
even export errors when rendering out
the final videos so we went back to
1080p down scaled from 4k using our
external recorder on the a can since the
fs700 sensor performs so well at
resolving fine details regardless of the
output file resolution anyway and
continued shooting being roll at 4k
natively on the gh4 since while that
does slow down the editing timeline it's
not in a manner that completely cripples
the productivity of our editors like the
4k native FS footage did so what you've
been seeing out of us since then this is
really important is a 4k timeline with
down
sampled 4k footage off the fs700 that is
then read
to 4k and native 4k footage from the gh4
that is then exported at 4k when we
create the file to upload to YouTube or
vessel fast forward almost a year and we
were moving into a new office and
rolling out three new servers a
rendering server powered by two intel
xeon e5 2699 v3 18 core processors a
high-speed SSD based 20 gigabit network
storage server and a 100 terabyte plus
archival storage server these
potentially addressed almost all of the
previous issues network performance file
size and rendering horsepower
not to mention that adobe hasn't been
sitting on ass for the last year and
premier has improved a fair bit as well
in terms of how it handles high bitrate
and 4k files so it was time to evaluate
whether it was worth it to go native 4k
again as part of an investigation into
how we could use our 36 core video
crunching server to improve our workflow
so we started by taking a closer look at
some of the 4k footage that we'd shot
recently on the gh4 comparing the visual
quality of the native 4k footage and
then that very same footage down sampled
to 1080p with a variety of codecs trying
to figure out how to get timeline
performance perfect and the results
shocked us when viewed on a 4k monitor
they were indistinguishable from each
other and in fact even when compared
using overlaid still captures in
Photoshop and by setting the blending
mode to difference they were nearly
identical so then was there any point
recording in 4k at all we needed to dig
deeper so we specifically recorded
identical clips at 4k and 1080p natively
on the gh4 camera and compared those
against each other this time with the
1080p footage up sampled the 4k same
result down sampling 4k to 1080p up
sampling 1080p to 4k they just all look
the same so we broke out the big guns
and used our proper professional-grade
camera our sony fs7
to do the same comparison now we can see
the difference watching the files over
our own local network between the
upsampled and the native 4k footage with
the text on our figurine appearing to be
more in focus when watching back the
native 4k file even though the camera
and subject were not moved in between
shots but what does this difference
translate to in terms of a real-world
benefit we all know that YouTube is at a
4k option for quite some time but should
content creators even be worried about
shooting and editing in 4k should they
export in 4k for their upload should you
the viewer select 4k when watching we
have all those answers but buckle in
because if the rest of this video
sounded pretty technical this is
probably going to be a little worse I'll
start with the answer for the content
creators
since this affects the content consumers
as well regardless of your camera
working on a 1080p timeline with 1080p
footage will not result in a degraded
experience for your viewers thanks to
the video processing done by YouTube the
benefit of your fancy camera is
basically limited to better performance
on a green screen and better color
grading and punching options in
post-production something that is
arguably much more important to the
appearance of the footage than sheer
resolution anyway so I'm not
pooh-poohing fancy cameras but we also
discovered that up sampling to 4k for
your final export is worth the extra
file size and the extra rendering time
because when YouTube detects a
resolution of 4k on their side they will
offer a 4k viewing option to the viewer
that features a higher playback bit rate
and therefore sharper image quality on
both 1080p and on 4k displays which
leads us finally to the answer for
consumers conventional wisdom would
dictate that watching content at the
native resolution of your display is
ideal this is something that most of our
viewers seem to be aware of based on
these poll results but if you have the
internet connection and bandwidth cap
limits to handle it this is not the case
for online video or
least on YouTube watching at 4k on a 4k
or 1080p monitor yields a noticeable
visual quality improvement regardless of
whether the video was natively shot at
4k or up sampled thanks to YouTube
delivering the video to you at a higher
bitrate which leaves us finally with a
last message for the content creators
out there if there's anything to take
away from this video it's don't get too
focused on 4k or resolution in general
in the same way that a 4k recording
phone is not a professional video
recording device entry-level 4k cameras
are not equal to their 4k pro-grade
brethren but don't worry most pros are
just using their for kid gear to have
more flexibility during the creation of
their 1080p final product anyway so if
you're producing web video you may
actually be better served by a superior
1080p camera at this time because lenses
encoding settings codecs camera sensor
size and sensor quality all impact the
finished product and on that subject
stay tuned for the results of our
investigation into editing codecs it's
going to be at least as interesting as
this one especially for you video
editors out there thanks for watching
