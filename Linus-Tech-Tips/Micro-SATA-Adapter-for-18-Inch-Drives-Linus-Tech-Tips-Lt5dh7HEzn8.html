Kingston SSDs now v+ 180 this is a 64
gig solid state drive and one of the
things I pointed out was quite special
about it is the fact that it's really
small so if we compare it to a normal
SSD that is a two and a half inch SSD
well it's very small and I also noted in
my unboxing that it uses a standard that
I'm not familiar with for its SATA
connection so this is called oh shoot I
totally forget no micro SATA yes
excellent and I grabbed this cable just
so that I could show you guys if you
ever need to pull data off a 1.8 inch
SATA Drive and you want or you want it
to let's say you randomly add at 1.8
inch SATA Drive like say for example me
and you wanted to be able to test it on
a desktop or or bench market or do
whatever else he does you need to do you
need to get one of these so right here
is the micro SATA interface that is
power and data so I'm going to go ahead
and plug that in just like that okay and
then what you have to do is you have to
take a regular Saito plug off your power
supply and plug it into the power so we
have now powered up the drive okay
no notable status change after you power
the drive because it is an SSD and it
doesn't make any noise and then finally
you need to whoops if it doesn't slip
under your test bench you need to plug
the SATA connector into the motherboard
alright and hopefully oh yeah that was
fast
look at that so we've already got it
ready to use and alright we have to
actually uh our I always forget most
efficient way to do this computer
managed dis management area and I am
fumbling around some tech tip ok so we
are going to initialize the disk and
then we are going to make a new simple
volume assign it to drive letter x4
extreme
and then we can view the file so it was
that simple that's all we had to do I
kind of wish I had some files to copy to
it or something but we can do that later
anyway that is what is involved in
adapting a micro SATA drive such as the
Kingston SSDs
be plus 180 to a regular SATA power and
data interface don't forget to subscribe

videos about my work and whatever else
it is that I upload to this channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
