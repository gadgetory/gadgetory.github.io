welcome to my unboxing and first look at
the blackberry z10 so i'm gonna open
this up with saying a big thanks to Bell
Mobility here in Canada for providing me
with a blackberry z10 because otherwise
I wouldn't have been able to get my
hands on this phone and as a Canadian I
am extremely excited about the Zed 10
because it is one of those sort of you
know you know Canadian company not
formerly rim now blackberries is kind of
their their their last big sort of kick
at the can with blackberry 10 and I'm
really really excited to try it out but
the funny thing about trying it out is
that I'm not actually gonna be the one
trying it out doing our I switched
30-day trial with blackberry 10 is
actually going to be slicks
responsibility so that'll be interesting
he's been a hardcore Android user for a
long time and I'm I'm just fascinated to
see how this goes so inside the box we
find not really a whole lot there's a
little tiny wall wart very very slim
very very stylish very small I mean
personally I prefer if they ship a
bigger wall board and it charges faster
but as long as it you know charges the
phone and charges it adequately then I
don't think we're gonna have a problem
here the USB port is on the side of it
just like that alright also included in
the box we've got some documentation so
start here which has presumably some
instructions because BlackBerry 10 is
all about gestures it's about getting
around with gestures there's no back
button there isn't even a home button
there's not a single hardware button on
the phone so for those of you who are
used to iOS are used to Android devices
where you do have hard buttons it might
be a bit of a thing to adapt to now I
was one of those few sort of you know
demented people who thought that the
BlackBerry PlayBook was awesome at the
time and really enjoyed the gesture
based navigation so maybe when slicks
done with the z10 I'll spend some time
with it and see what I think of that in
more of a smartphone like environment so
the other things inside the box are you
know nice long USB - a - mini B cable
for charging as well as a pair of
headphones although I'm not entire
convinced that anyone actually uses the
headphone / headsets that are included
with phones these days but there you go
it's got a single button so you can take
your calls as well as a clip so you can
clip it to things and then what appear
to be probably the most uncomfortable at
your buds ever anyway that's not what
you paid good money for you paid good
money for the z10 phone so on the top of
the phone you're gonna find your lock
button as well as your headphone and
microphone port so it's a three and a
half millimeter jack i've actually
powered up the phone just now
the said 10 has one of the brightest
screens available on the market with
some guys measuring it as high as 700 CD
per M squared which is pretty much meant
to be usable in direct sunlight the
disadvantage to there the way that
they've implemented their screen
brightness functionality is that you
actually cannot turn off auto brightness
now this is one of the things that
bothered me immediately about Windows
Phone 8 where some of the decisions were
being made for me for example in Windows
Phone 8 it is impossible to auto to lock
the auto-rotate you can't do it it auto
rotates no matter what and I'm looking
at this going really and then in iOS at
least when I'm back when I was using it
maybe they've changed this now you were
only able to lock phones in portrait you
couldn't lock them in landscape and why
are you making these decisions for me
why don't you let me make the decision
whether I want to trade-off battery life
or whether I want to trade off the
screen brightness so so there you go
that's something that sort of doesn't
appeal to me about it right off the bat
but you know since I'm not the one doing
the I switched I won't be the one to
have any complaints about it I suppose
on the side we find micro HDMI as well
as a USB port for charging and then on
the bottom we've got what looks like yes
the price pot to pick take off the back
plate so we'll we'll cover that in just
a moment and then on the other side
we've got the volume rocker so on the
back of the unit there's sort of a
chromed finished thing here I'm sure if
you're watching this video you've
probably seen a blackberry z10 at this
point but there's the 8 megapixel rear
camera as well as the flash and then on
the front there's a 2 megapixel camera
that is right about there now I've had
people complain I look at my screen
I've had people complain about the
finish at the back of the phone saying
that it feels that it feels cheap but I
don't get that impression at all I mean
let's be really clear this is not the
HTC one this is not like a beautiful one
of the most beautifully anodized
finished phones I've ever encountered
but it's also not where did that thing
go it's also not a galaxy s4 where it's
like a glossy scratch Abul piece of
plastic on the back that actually feels
quite flimsy even compared to the z10 so
let's go ahead and top the backing off
of this one you can see it's just like
it could be a butterfly
if butterflies were made of plastic and
stuck to the back of phones whereas the
one on this at 10 which I've already
actually know what that's really not any
better is it okay well there you go I
like the texture then let me just put it
that way I find it easier to not drop
but the advantage of any of these phones
that have replaceable backs whether it's
the s4 s3 or whether it's the z10 is
that you can replace that back cover
with something else if you don't like
the stock one so speaking of replacing
things if you don't like them there's a
removable battery just like Samsung's
phones and then you've also got your SIM
slot right there so they make you remove
the battery in order to swap that oh
that's kind of a smart design and a
micro SD card reader and if there's
anything I've missed about the HTC One
in spite of the fact that I went from
iOS where Apple doesn't has never
believed in expandable storage to
Android going from a 16 gig phone to a
32 gig phone I found on a modern phone
when you're shooting a lot of 1080p
video with how great the video capture
capabilities of these new phones are
you're going to use up the space really
fast if you're a content creator at all
so spec wise you guys probably know this
already it's 1280 by 768 so you are
fully capable of watching HD videos but
not full HD that gives up 335 pixels per
inch which back when it was released was
quite competitive but these days with
phones like the HTC One and the and the
galaxy s4 on the market is a little bit
different it's got bluetooth for NFC
dual band Wi-Fi 4G LTE a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 plus which isn't
as fast as what you might find in
something like the Droid DNA from a
TC or the newer s700 processors in the
HTC One and the Galaxy s4 but it's still
plenty fast for most of the things that
you're going to be doing whether it's
browsing or whatever else it's got two
gigs of RAM and this is the kind of one
of the coolest things I think that I've
ever encountered on anything anywhere
ever so I haven't actually used the
phone yet I've not quite touched the
screen yet but check this out so the way
that they've implemented the keyboard
which is a very clean layout by the way
to see seen reports that there's no
delay no leg and that seems to be true
for the most part this is something that
started to drive me crazy about the
iPhone 4 near the end of its usable
lifespan for me but oh it's a bit of a
lag there yeah you can see that anyway
is when there's when there's a delay on
the keyboard it just drives me nuts but
under the screen there's actually heat
sensors so if you consistently miss type
and miss hit the z10 will actually learn
where you usually hit when you're aiming
for a particular key over time and make
life easier for you so hopefully slick
we'll talk about that during his
impressions of the phone and yeah that
should be just like absolutely awesome
so let's show some of the basic gestures
so let's go back to see it's funny
because I still don't know how to use it
at all so I think it's from one side
blackberry hub so that takes you to the
hub you can add accounts hub is cool
because it allows you to bring all of
your messaging together whether it's
Facebook SMS or whatever else and then
besides just showing you everything at
the same time you can also filter out
the things that you don't want to see
let's just go ahead and lock the phone
so that I can so I can start from
scratch here alright so let's do a tour
of the gestures that are the main
gesture so we are unlocking the phone up
here actually here's something even when
you're in sleep you can unlock the phone
by nope yeah there we go
very cool so you don't actually have to
press the hard unlock button you can
have it just locked and going up from
the bottom unlocks it or you can see the
lock screen which will give you a
preview of any notifications that you
have as well as allow you to access your
camera without actually unlocking
phone entirely so then we do the same
thing in order to do that so
multitasking is accessed by scrolling up
from the bottom and from there you can
actually see some of the things that I
have open including search settings
calendar now this is a funny one the
browser is open but you can see it's
sideways this is a bit of a weird thing
where if you leave an app sideways and
get this okay so you scroll up from the
bottom now and it opens up multi - it's
in portrait really so you have to take
your phone and go like this and then it
leaves that app actually in in landscape
mode so there's there's some funny
things but you know what for those of
you watching the video this is an
unboxing I am NOT a blackberry 10 expert
by any stretch of the imagination but
these are things that are already a
little bit unintuitive for someone who's
coming from a few other major smartphone
platforms that I'm pretty familiar with
now so anyway so there's that from the
lock screen down swipe puts it in
bedside mode which I personally think is
really cool I it basically just turns
your phone into a clock and then gives
you easy access to alarms it's these
kinds of productivity focused things see
there's a little clock you continue
notifications on or off there you go
well whatever they were off before now
they're apparently I don't know
somewhere and then you can turn your
alarm on and off just by doing this
which i think is really neat and you get
rid of that just by scrolling up and
getting rid of it the other thing too is
when the phone's not unlocked again
these are very product right
multitasking then we can that see there
as an Android user and an iOS user
that's unintuitive to me on both of the
previous major platforms that I've used
scrolling down from the top lets me
access my quick settings and my
notifications regardless so there you go
we have to be in the multitasking menu
so rotation lock Wi-Fi notifications
alarms Bluetooth from settings are all
accessible from within here now moving
over to your I guess whatever it's
called app drawer right is just
scrolling to the right so you can see
all your apps that launch they had
70,000 apps I don't know how many they
have now but at least they have sort of
the critical ones things like Facebook
and Twitter which we're missing first
party apps when Windows Phone 8 launched
at least I think one other two of them
were same thing with YouTube where
Windows Phone 8 was missing a native
well ok there was a native app written
by
someone in collaboration with Microsoft
but it wasn't a Google app and that was
that was really that was really missing
then um okay swiping oh yeah so from
within any app so let's go back to here
so no matter where we are we can go into
our multitasking here this is a vastly
inferior thing compared to the Android
experience that I've been having so when
you go to here I can see I don't need
such a large preview of the browser
thing that I had open or whatever else I
prefer this approach where I have nine
things and I understand that the larger
4.7 inch 1080p screen versus a 4.3 inch
720p screen enables that but it's
considering that they're in the same
sort of price bracket I would consider
that a much superior way of doing
multitasking but once you're in here you
can preview your messages just by
holding and then if you gesture from
left to right off the screen you can
access the BlackBerry hub which as you
can see I did a quick test between me
myself and I of the text messaging and
then I can also see my text messages my
blackberry messenger and a hub which
sort of once you add the accounts puts
everything in there phone dialing so
BlackBerry hasn't forgotten that this is
a phone so the first thing that you're
gonna see every time you scroll up from
our swipe up from the bottom is going to
be phone searching camera these are sort
of the most critical these are the
things I use most often on my phone with
the exception of search I really don't
use that that much I usually just open a
browser but phone is great to have there
you can't dial by number unfortunately
so if I put in lioness that's not gonna
work this is a great feature on Android
I use it all the time
I almost never look at my contact list
any more because I can just dial people
by name outstanding every platform
should have it and that is a very very
unfortunate thing but apparently
searching contacts is quick according to
some of the sort of anecdotal evidence
that I've read about but honestly I
don't see this being any quicker than
what I already had on iOS which is not
as fast as just dialing it in the new
blackberry messenger includes video
calls and screen sharing as long as you
have enough data for it and of course
the feature that makes blackberry
blackberry is the security so blackberry
balance
unlike Samsung's Knox which is their
bring-your-own-device
work initiative for having a an employer
accessible sort of corporate section of
the phone when you bring your own device
and then your own personal one and they
can't talk to each other
blackberry balance has been around for
years and is very very well regarded in
that in that respect so I think that's
pretty much it that covers what you guys
probably need to know about the Zed ten
that isn't gonna be covered by slick
when he goes cold turkey on Android with
his s3 I'm taking your s3 that's yeah
no s3 for you you're going you're going
z10 you know you're going z10 and thank
