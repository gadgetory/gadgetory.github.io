while you can see that's a box of hard
drives and here we have that Norco case
that I promised I'd do just a stupid
raid build in and that's what I've been
working on for the last little bit here
so in terms of the hardware specs we've
got an end tech 1200 watt power supply
we've got a dfi x58 board four gigs of
ddr2 ram we've got a fairly low-end Core
2 Duo processor in there and then
probably the most expensive piece of
this entire build is this guy right here
this is an arica 24 port raid card with
512 Meg's of RAM on it you can actually
replace that with more RAM if you feel
like it it's got a high end processor
and we're using SFF 8087 cables to
connect to the back planes that are
built into this norco chassis so I'm
gonna I think that covers pretty much
everything I got I got kind of a basic
video card in here and this is just an
in-progress shot so you can see I've
actually just begun to install hard
drives in here so I've got two Western
Digital 1 terabyte black drives and
that's it so far so I'm going to be
installing another 22 drives so that
means depending on how we configure it
we can have up to a 24 terabyte raid
zero hard drive partitions so yeah
that's pretty cool don't you think and I
guess that's all there is to say about
it for now we're just going to I'm not
sure what I'm trying to accomplish with
this it's just like I had this case and
like I had this card I was like okay
well what kind of stupid voodoo magic
thing can we do with this and this is
what I came up with so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
