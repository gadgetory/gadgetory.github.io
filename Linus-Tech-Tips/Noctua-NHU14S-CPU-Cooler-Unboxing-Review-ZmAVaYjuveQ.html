ready for anything
click now to learn more welcome to my
unboxing of it seriously to leave your
plus vitamins on the table of the Nhu
14s which is part of their award-winning
u series which basically was what the
Germans used to win the weight now
that's probably not funny they're
Austrian okay hold on
so the hu 14s is a single tower heat
pipe cooler so not like the D series so
there D 14 is the dual Tower one it
retains the same performance as their
previous view series coolers but does
some does it a little bit differently so
it has a slimmer profile that allows the
Nhu 14 s to be installed on a
motherboard even in LGA 2011 motherboard
with fans with full height ramped and
not have any interference so let's go
ahead and pull this bad boy out of here
as always knock to as packaging is
excellent if a little bit plain so it's
just plain cardboard packaging fully
recyclable which I do actually like to
see inside we see that they've included
one of their NFA 15 fans which is a 140
millimeter fan that actually uses 120
millimeter mounting points so this gives
it pretty good compatibility however
this particular fan design you can tell
just by looking at it was pretty much
optimized for this cooler you can tell
because you see right here the vibration
reducing pads that are on the four
corners of the fan are set up perfectly
to sit on here you go this piece right
here on the outside of the Nhu 14s now
when it comes to product quality if you
guys have been watching me for any
period of time you'll already know what
I think about the Nhu 14s what I thought
about it before I even opened it it is
the utmost pinnacle of product quality
noctua makes excellent gear they back it
up with a six year warranty which you
might say want to heatsink that doesn't
matter will on
and it does they're saying their friend
will not die for six years or they'll
deal with it for you they use some of
the best actually I would go as far as
to just call they're mounting mechanism
the best in the industry you can see
right here it comes in either this box
right here for the Intel mounting system
so it's going to have like you know
wicked solid hold down pieces that are
made of like thick old steel it's going
to have all the little screws and a nice
little package here it's going to have a
thick backplate I mean look at that
thing it's rugged and it's going to huh
it's going to have the option for you to
upgrade it for free later in all
likelihood because Noctua has done that
for years now offering existing
customers new mounting hardware for
future sockets so there's the AMD stuff
in here as well as all the accessories
in this box right here so this is where
you'll find your C even their case
badges are better than other people's
case badges they include a gorgeous
metal case badge as well as noise
dampening strips so if you don't want to
use not to a fans they do include a
couple of rubber strips so you can use
different fans but you should probably
use the Noctua fence a couple more metal
retention clips for mounting different
fans to the heatsink as well as their
nth one which is good I mean it's not
the best thermal compound on the market
unlike everything else about the product
which does happen to be as good as it
gets but it's not bad at all they've
also got some additional corner mounts
that's kind of interesting for the fan
presumably so that's kind of neat and
then they've got a screw driver so you
don't actually even have to have any
extra tools in order to install the Nhu
14s speaking of installing it on the
base right here you will find that it is
actually not that shiny of a base so
we'll do the obligatory finger shot
there you can see you can't make up my
finger that clearly guys the the
shininess of the base does not actually
necessarily tell you anything about the
thermal performance of it this has been
true for years Swift Tech was one of the
ones that had trouble with this because
they used to do a very flat look on the
bottoms of their blocks but it was flat
even though it wasn't shiny and they
sometimes got flack for that versus
other manufacturers highly polishing the
bases but they weren't actually
flat which is not conducive to it being
a better cooler this particular base
doesn't happen to be completely flat
it's a little bit bowed which has been
shown with the high mounting pressures
we use today to give slightly better
performance than a completely flat base
and you can see right here at the bottom
they use six heat pipes and it should be
noted that even though they're quite
small heat pipes they're not you know
super pipes like a soos actually here I
have them happen to have it right here
is using a 10 millimeter heat pipe on
their latest gtx 780 cards you can see
by contrast the 4 millimeter pipes don't
look that big but quality of heat pipes
is actually terribly important whereas
the size of them is important but is not
the only factor the overall
manufacturing of it is of course perfect
it has no blemishes on it whatsoever the
fins are all completely straight exactly
like you'd expect from nock to as
excellent packaging and check it out
more on that hold down I mean look how
thick that piece of steel is on the top
of this cooler so what is the advantage
basically they've taken the U series
they've upgraded it to 140 millimeter
giving you better performance while the
same performance but giving you better
performance in a slimmer form factor
than what you can get elsewhere allowing
you to use a nice high performance
cooler to fans and full-size memory
modules meaning that you can actually
cool your memory directly with the fans
on your CPU heatsink as well without
further ado I'm going to sign off and
hand you guys over to slick to talk
about the performance of the Nhu 14s on
our standard test bench so we can start
with idles at 20 degrees Celsius so if
you want to see more details about our
ambient temperatures and the rounding
and everything that's going on you can
check out the Google Doc that's linked
in the description but these are our
temperatures at 20 degrees Celsius for
idle so I was kind of surprised at how
well it actually performed and now a few
you can be looking at the Zalman results
and be a little bit confused but what's
going on there is I have that fan turned
down to 1,100 rpm and that fan actually
naturally runs a lot faster now we can't
replace the fan on that cooler so in the
review of that cooler we'll have a
couple of different RPMs going on there
but I was really impressed with its
performance on idle and we're gonna move
on to load now into load performance
which I'm a lot more interested in
because honestly I know the
going to work on idle its load that I'm
really kind of worried about and I'm
interested to see how things will play
out so that you can see the hidi and the
Zelman res Raider three kind of fight
with themselves down at the bottom and
then the interesting race is a little
bit higher than that with this guy on
the Corsair h100 I again will have more
numbers as time goes on except to rerun
a lot of things but I was really
impressed with it did quite well and it
makes sense because of how big it is and
because of the fact that it has a much
larger higher performance fan but I was
still quite impressed like this video if
you liked it dislike this video if you
don't like it and in the comments what
are you going to go with now a iOS have
been here for a while but there's still
some perceived terror over them now are
you going to go with an AI o or an air
cooler that's up to you and if you like
