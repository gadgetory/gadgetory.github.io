of emotions for me over the years with
the highest peak being when I dropped a
crap ton of cash on them for my staff
and the biggest Valley being shortly
afterward the defect rate of the
aforementioned blades that I bought for
my staff now the most recent last gen
blade was fine in fact we've got two
units that are both still working like
the day we got them but it was such a
boring pure spec update that honestly I
was having a hard time figuring out what
the heck razor has been working on for
the last few years
fortunately all of that changes today
this is the blade 2018 and this is our
sponsor today Corsair Corsairs
next-generation strafe mark 2 keyboard
features a variety of Cherry MX RGB key
switches and eight megabytes of on-board
profile storage check out the link below
to learn more
once I got over the shock of razor
moving to kind of a a boxier design
compared to their older curvy one my
initial impressions of the razor blade
2018 are actually very positive the
aluminum chassis is extremely rigid in
spite of its overall slimness and the
significant reduction in bezel size
makes it feel far more 20:18 then it's
not so 2018 predecessors probably the
most important change to the ID here
though is that razor has finally made a
laptop that will impress both your
gaming friends and your business
associates that is assuming of course
that you do get at least a little bit of
help from debrand
and maybe tone down the RGB on the
keyboard so it has HDMI mini DisplayPort
and USB type-c along with three
full-sized USB Taipei's and that type
see I showed you that's a Thunderbolt 3
port very nice not to mention it's got
significantly better performance so its
core i7 8750 age and gtx 1070 max-q
might seem a little pedestrian compared
to other manufacturers who have been
bitten by the core i9 bug but as we've
seen over the last couple of weeks
unless you're building a machine like
this one you can actually end up better
off with a less powerful cpu but one
that you can actually cool compared to
an Opie one that ends up throttling all
day so we're gonna fire up an i-264 test
here and we're gonna see that while the
20:18 does actually trade some clock
speed for thermals when hit with a
synthetic load so you can see here it's
running at 2.6 gigahertz for a short
while then it's gonna drop down to our
base of 2.2 gigahertz in games this
thing regularly turbos up to 4 gigahertz
ending up in about the 90 degrees range
and never thermal throttled in our 24
degrees Celsius office and our GPU
stayed nice and cool in the low 70s and
as you
see here I'm gonna lean in close to it
the Finns are certainly audible but not
distracting at all and what else is cool
is that this generation blade keeps the
keyboard nice and cool even while gaming
though it should be noted that this area
right here right above the keyboard
that's where your heatsink is you are
not going to want to touch that
now performance is right about where we
expect it with the 1070 max-q getting
beaten but even then only slightly by
the full-fat gtx 1070 in the asus
zephyrus what linus you might say what I
really loved about the old blade was how
loud it was huh if you're not concerned
gamer I'm just gonna fire up synapse
here all you have to do is enter gaming
mode which actually boosts up the clock
speed here we go of our gtx 1070 max q
takes the CPUs TDP from 35 to 45 watts
with a max turbo power of 85 watts and
generally makes the blade 2018 a worse
laptop if you were blindfolded in gaming
mode with the blade 2018 in front of you
we'd forgive you if you mistook your
gaming rig for a drone taking off we
would actually recommend leaving gaming
mode off until Razer provides maybe some
finer control of the power and fan
profiles because the performance gain is
in our estimation not really worth it
now on the subject of options that
gamers should actually use the 144 Hertz
1080p version of this notebook is the
one to get you can completely ignore the
60 Hertz 4k version unless you
desperately need a touch screen 1080p
144 Hertz is a perfect fit for this CPU
GPU combo and the IPS panel in this
version is bright and vivid with the
high refresh memory making everything
from games to even just messing around
on the desktop navigating windows feel
and more responsive I think the only
thing that I would like to see added in
razors options is a touch version of the
1080p one because right now they're
really making you choose between the
ultimate compact gaming laptop and one
that is still optimal for productivity
though this might be something that we
have to take up with the actual panel
manufacturers and not so much with Razer
now above the screen here is the webcam
pretty decent compared to other laptop
webcams which is to say that it is still
behind literally every flagship phone on
the market and we really wish that
laptop makers other than Microsoft I
guess would be the only one that seems
to be taking it seriously still bad we
wish they would start doing a better job
given how small of a camera element you
can have and how inexpensive a camera
element you can have that can end up
with a very nice-looking image these
days with that said at least Razer
borrowed some of its mobile expertise on
the speakers for this puppy they do lack
a little bit of punch on the low end but
they make up for it with clear sound
that is pretty loud and excellent stereo
separation
now back to the bit that we talked about
before about how this machine could
easily be used for gaming and
productivity what about the keyboard now
razer keyboards have been a real
sticking point between me and Alex who
has kind of become our de-facto notebook
editor now I have liked most of razor's
notebook keyboards with the notable
exception being the blade Pro key on the
other hand literally changed my personal
blade stealth desktop background to this
when he had to use it for like an hour
now fortunately Razer has actually made
some revisions to the keyboard in this
model and we can finally agree it's very
good it's got a nice snappy feel to the
keystrokes it's not too loud and we both
feel comfortable typing on this machine
for hours then below that very
satisfactory keyboard is one of the
biggest touch pads that I have ever seen
on a Windows machine in fact it it might
be the biggest one like check this thing
out it is awesome to use like it baffles
me that it has been two years since the
Apple MacBook Pro 2016 and no one has
ripped off that design yet like it's
still not quite as good as the one on
the MacBook Pro but with its glass top
really nice feel nice clicky buttons
although not the whole surface is
clickable it's the closest that we've
seen in a Windows machine opening up the
blade 2018 reveals actually pretty
impressive upgrade ability given its
size both the RAM that's a new one and
the storage can be easily swapped and
that is a hacking impressive 80 watt
hour battery that gives it four hours of
life in our PC mark test now that's not
an amazing result compared to other
productivity centric notebooks but it
absolutely smashes other gaming laptops
that are this powerful bringing us to
the price our model here comes in at
2,400 US dollars which is considerably
more than the asu's eris but I'm going
to put next to a
right here and remember guys this is a
laptop that already had a substantial
thin tax built into the toll that it was
gonna take on your wallet if you're
gonna be gaming day and night we feel
that the Zephyrus is a better choice it
offers a bit more performance while
making less noise it has more room for
games thanks to its hard drive in
addition to its SSD and it offers silky
smooth visuals thanks to gsync by
contrast the blade is still very
competent for gaming and crushes the
Zephyrus when you're on the go thanks to
its more professional looks excellent
trackpad smaller form factor and double
the battery life but of course you get
to pay a thinness tax and a razor tax
speaking of taxes dbrand ships worldwide
have anything to do with that whatever
it doesn't matter
dbrand makes awesome vinyl skins for
laptops phones tablets consoles
controllers and more they use high
quality true textured 3m vinyl on every
product and their skins are cut with
unrivaled precision they measure many
times and cut once only to ensure they
have a factory fit for your product not
only do they look great but debrand
skins protect against incidental damage
and scratches like say for exempt one of
the main reasons I love a new brand skin
on my laptop is sliding in and out of my
bag that way you don't end up with a
completely scuffed up surface on both
sides of your laptop that sucks
especially when you're paying this much
for it their products are affordable and
they ship worldwide so check them out at

which has cool shirts like this one well
like this one in the sense that they're
ltte not like this one in the sense that
you can buy this design anymore and the
