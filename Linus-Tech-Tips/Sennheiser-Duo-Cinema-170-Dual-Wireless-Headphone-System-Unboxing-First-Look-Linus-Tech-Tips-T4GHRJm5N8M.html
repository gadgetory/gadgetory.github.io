a product that's pretty cool now I was
actually looking for something like this
a number of years ago when I was when I
was sharing little okay this is just
hard work when I was sharing living
accommodations with somebody as opposed
to living on my own and the reason I was
looking for something like this was that
not everyone in the house you know in a
house that is shared necessarily wants
to go to bed at the same time so if I
wanted to watch movies with my
girlfriend at the time um late at night
it could be annoying because it's loud
bothersome and you know bass is
unpleasant for for people who don't want
to hear it when they're sleeping that
kind of thing so I was looking for
something with a wireless headphone set
up that could support multiple
headphones
and I ended up not being able to find
anything mind you this was a couple
years ago this solution while fairly
expensive would have been exactly what I
needed so this is the duo cinema 170
which is basically the RS 170 digital
wireless surround sound experience and I
think what they mean is digital wireless
headphones with surround sound it's an
experience you so they it's an RS 170
set which includes the dock as well as a
pair of headphones with a supplementary
set of HDR 170 so that is the headphones
now the dock supports up to four at a
time but let's have a look at what
Sennheiser has to say for themselves
before we get too much further closed
circumaural digital wireless headphones
with clears uncompressed audio
transmission okay so what does all of
that mean uncompressed audio
transmission means better quality audio
that's fairly simple what does closed
mean so closed means that the sound is
isolated from the people around you
whatever you're listening to is isolated
from the people around you and whatever
you're listening to is not going to be
interfered with by the ambient noise
around you
as well so close means that they are
somewhat sound isolating okay
circumaural that just means it goes
around your ear so that's pretty
straightforward dynamic transducer
systems with powerful neodymium magnets
for clearing detailed audio reproduction
I don't think that it is necessary for
me to say that sennheiser is well-known
for their phenomenal sound quality um
yeah they've been doing it a while so I
just kind of trust them on this one
surrounded dynamic Dada dynamic based
listening modes cool multi-purpose
transmitter also functions as easy
charge cradle and docking station multi
receiver transmission up to four people
listening to the same source ergonomic
and adjustable headband for excellent
secure fit I had it on backwards before
and I was like oh he's not very
comfortable now they are leatherette
your pad and head pad cushions for
outstanding comfort no setup required
just plug and play
so no setup required what does that mean
that means in theory there should be no
syncing of the docking station to the
headphones themselves it should be just
basically transmission of sound out and
receiving of sound in so let's go ahead
and open up the accessory package for a
little quick so there's a guide as well
as your random piece of plastic the deed
for a peep
that's so much better in French than in
English awesome instruction manual on
PDF how to activate oh cool okay so here
let's check it out so you've got
controls on the side of the on the side
of the headphone so there's your volume
up and down your power button and you
can go into the either surround or bass
mode actually let's do the close-up look
at the headphones themselves right now
so you got your leather red leather ette
cups which you can see have nice deep
padding around them you've also got a
very ear shaped headphone see this is
the kind of thing that it takes
Sennheiser to figure out is that ears
are not ovals and they're not circles
that is the difference between audio
companies and like gaming companies like
there's a well known gaming headset for
around 100 bots not going to name any
names but D the earphones are like big
circles like this and while it
accommodates almost any shape of ear
they could have just as easily gone with
a big shape like this and
culminated almost in a year as long as
your ears aren't on sideways and I hope
I haven't offended any viewers whose
ears are sideways on their heads I don't
think I have any of them so there you go
the difference between audio products
and not audio products the little things
so there's your adjusting hoo-ha on the
side of it everything that comes with it
I don't know we need too much though
okay cool so you can either not boost so
you can undo store you can run it at
full volume from the base station itself
shows you how to connect the audio
devices to it okay all those pretty
straightforward so you can use it with
pretty much anything that supports a
three and a half jack so our few point
five millimeter Jack there's power and
then there's the zero decibel or minus
eight decibel settings got a pretty
secure base stand on it shows you when
is charging shows you minutes and base
or surround and it has a power button on
it so that's very very simple um yeah
that's cool so you're not let it limit
into movies you can also have you know
you can have it plugged into your you
know music player of some sort I mean
you do people still have CD players so
you can plug it into one of those if you
wanted to safety guide look at that it
has a bigger safety guide than an
instruction booklet gotta be really safe
about using this like it's like if
someone like puts on these headphones
and suddenly they're like inspired to
like I'll crash into like something and
use it safely don't like yeah it'll be
unsafe okay um bunch of stuff in here no
way okay
I already I'm all ready okay I'll admit
this right now I'm already bit of a
sennheiser like fanboy over here I love
Sennheiser products they just blew my
mind
because they included one of the other
products that I'm also like the biggest
fanboy of sanyo eneloop batteries these
things are amazing they last forever you
can recharge them like a billion times
and they're just the best rechargeable
batteries ever and they include real
rechargeable
so that has a ton of dip by the way that
was my memory card being full not my
battery running out so there are a ton
of advantages to this one is that that
means that this is a whatever they are I
think they're nickel metal hydride or
something like that remember I don't
remember what kind they are but they're
like awesome and anyway it means that
this is a charger for Anna loops which
means that you can swap these out with
other more different any loops and you
can actually the great thing about Anna
loops 2 is that they'll hold their
charge for an extended period of time
even when they're not being used and
they're not being charged so you can
have extra batteries on hand that are
good quality batteries that you can use
in all kinds of other things and you can
easily swap them in and out and charge
them on the base charge them in your
wall charger whatever else the case may
be so they included real batteries
instead of like crappy non-rechargeable
which are just going to end up in a
landfill and are offensive for that and
a number of other reasons including the
cost of them which is just absurd
because you advertise these over how
many times you charge them over the
course of five years 10 years and it's
like pennies anyway moving on we've got
a cord protector we've got a
three-and-a-half millimeter to three and
a half millimeter cable as well as an
adapter to RCA so you've got everything
you need to easily plug this device into
anything that outputs a stereo signal
great you've got oh look at that or I'll
put yeah so anything that I'll put the
stereo signal so you could even plug it
into I like one of the bigger headphone
jacks just like that preferably without
plastic inside the connector next we've
got power adapter and a bunch of
international power adapters okay
so now let's take a closer look at the
headphones themselves so they're
adjustable here which we sort of have
come to expect they have a lot of
rotation here so even if you have kind
of a funny head shape where your ears
are back here or your ears are like more
positioned here no matter what you're
going to have pretty good comfort there
you've also got there's your charging
contacts which go on to the base station
and then you've also got your pleather
II foamy sort of tops right here so
they're very lightweight actually for
wireless headphone
and they're also very very comfortable
just due to the fact that Sennheiser has
been doing this for a while and they
know how to make headphones that fit
your head which I mean sounds easy but
actually isn't I mean so in here we find
yeah basically the same thing again I'm
not going to bother really taking that
out because I don't think we're
contributing anything at this point but
to more Ana loops and another pair of
headphones are inside the second piece
there so there you go that is the RS 170
headphones the duo cinema package which
includes two RS 170 s and it is also the
unboxing partial unboxing of the HDR 170
which is the well made not not including
a receiver so the useless one that only
is useful if you already have one of
these so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look I think I just
said that I think that whole long spiel
is okay well then you can just tune out
at any time now I - don't forget to
