so theoretically we're live are we I
can't tell I hate flying in the dark
like this are we live
I think we're live cool hi everyone
welcome to a very unusual livestream
here in the parking lot at Linus Media
Group so we've hauled our whole setup
outside you want to show port Anthony
sitting sitting sitting in the parking
lot here we've got a we've got a you
know we've got a spot for him with his
ups and is mixer and stream PC and all
that good stuff and Cleve green yeah we
know we know okay there was a whole
thing so the purpose of this livestream
is twofold one is we have gotten a lot
of questions including one of our
neighbors here in the business complex
where our offices who literally walked
up to us while we were preparing to do
this live stream and goes hey so yeah I
was wondering you know like I saw your
car was pink and all that but then one
day you drove up and it was like covered
and all this stuff what happened with
that
so purpose number one of the live stream
is to finally answer once and for all
for all of those who don't know what the
heck happened to my car and purpose
number two was actually to do a test of
our simultaneous live-streaming we've
set up an rtmp server here in our server
room and the idea is that it's going to
we're gonna push to that at a very high
quality encoding bitrate then that is
gonna take it and it's gonna push to
youtube and twitch separately at least
that was the theory if that had worked
we would have gone live at exactly 3:30
instead of 3:30 4:00 so it's not working
yet we aren't sure exactly why we've had
tests running all week and it was just
fine and then of course the second you
go to try and actually do something it
completely falls apart so what happened
with my car well the as the saga goes I
bought a 2003 Honda Civic for eleven
thousand dollars back above
must have been about 1011 years ago now
and I went with this car because it was
pretty much the best kilometers left on
it per dollar that I could find on the
market so it only had about forty
forty-five thousand clicks on it even
though it was actually about four or
five years old at that time it was just
eleven grand but the guy was getting rid
of it because his lease was up and he
had the option to buy it out but he
didn't want it something something
something anyway we also I think statute
of limitations is up so I can admit that
he gifted it to me so I actually did not
pay tax on that purchase that was that
was a long time ago good luck going
after me for that anyway so it was a
really really good deal and I I have I
have driven it whether sort of I liked
it or not
ever since then now a lot of people
wonder you know you're a youtuber you
know with that YouTube money what kind
of what kind of car do you drive so I
don't think I've ever actually done like
a proper tour of my car so it's got a
lot of features you know the horn it's
got the windows windows that go like
this not like this you know windows like
this okay the doors don't lock so if you
actually ever did see my car in a
parking lot somewhere I would appreciate
if you didn't but um the odds of you
being able to just open up the door and
go go into it are 100% because and I can
I can explain why I was actually broken
into a couple times probably about must
have been about seven eight years back
and what they did was they they broke my
my door locks so these are just for
decoration now my keys don't work in
these in these door locks anymore and
while I could have the thing rekey then
all of a sudden I have to carry around
two keys one for the ignition and one
for the doors and so it was a similar
story on the other side and then because
this is such a basic car this is the
base based basic estrada l' of the honda
civic from that year it doesn't even
have keyholes for the back so there is
there's I can lock the car because I
could go like this oh wow you can see
stuck that is full of glitter glue so I
could lock it but I wouldn't be able to
unlock it so the only way to get back
inside my car in the event that it's
locked and I have had to do this is to
open up the trunk see it's really easy
to find the the key hole for the trunk
you just look for one of the blue paint
splotches and then just kind of yeah
there see that one so I've actually had
to do this before what I would crawl in
from the back here and then there's a
safety catch for the here we go for the
seats to push them down and then I can
crawl back into the car cuz I lent it to
my sister and she didn't realize that
you can't you can't lock it and so she
locked it when she parked it for me and
I had to pull one of these Oh
in order to get back into the driver's
seat now there's some other really basic
stuff about my car it's a manual
transmission but I actually really like
that that's that's one of the only
redeeming features because as you can
see it's got lots of places for buttons
but it doesn't actually have any buttons
to go there you know see here's another
here's another empty button that that
doesn't do anything I don't even have
air conditioning although I did upgrade
my deck as you can see I've done a
tremendous job of peeling back some of
the paint so I can at least tell what
radio station I'm listening to yeah
that's a CD CD CD deck right there with
aux-in that's beautiful my wife got that
for me that was actually a gift so
here's what here's what happened right
so then it was painted by by Nick by the
one and only Nick Evie actually it was
painted originally by the whole team as
part of the office break-in prank so I I
got everyone away from the office so we
could break so we could paint the car
and then we staged a break-in at the
office while they were there so that
went up over on channel super fun and
then the one and only Nick Evie you did
up the see this is pink now but it used
to be orange yeah there we go did up the
orange rims with the green racing
stripes and so it got to the point that
it was such a ridiculous meme that I
figured ok LTX this year so that's the
convention that we did back
and I want to say July those LTX in July
you guys think so I think it was in July
so we decided as like totally
last-minute thing literally the night
before we decided this we were gonna get
some art supplies so Nick light was
legitimately out buying glitter paint
markers all that kind of crazy stuff oh
yeah this is the one the morning of LTX
and then he brought it down there we put
out some tarps and we decided kind of a
fun event would be giving people an
opportunity to leave their mark on my
car indelibly forever as sort of a like
you know they were here kind of thing
the only issue is that people got a
little bit carried away so you can see
everything from the outside to the
inside to even under the hood got
painted or glittered or glued like
someone even took the battery connector
off painted the battery terminal and
then put it back on maybe they were
trying to do me a favor and make me
think that my car was dead so that I
would finally get around to replacing it
but true to form I spent about two three
hours after LTX cleaning off my
windshield cleaning off the rest of my
wooden look at this someone painted this
timing belt I don't actually know if
that's a timing belt it's definitely a
belt so I'm gonna I don't I don't I'm
not much of a car guy but I'll get to
that later that's actually an important
aspect of this stream so if someone
actually painted that so anyway I
cleaned off to the greatest extent that
I could some of the windows and I didn't
entirely do my best I guess I could have
chipped away a little of this and I've
been driving it but the issue here is
that while I am mostly okay with driving
this there are some things that have
been kind of issues so with the amount
of glitter glue that got dumped onto my
seats can you hear that like they're
actually quite crunchy and it's not very
comfortable
so that's a bit of a problem and then
because there's so much glitter in my
car it kind of gets everywhere so you
can see here that I had to take James
somewhere for a shoot and he actually
insisted on bringing a tablecloth into
my car and putting it on the seat so
that he didn't have to touch it my wife
my wife went to a business meeting must
have been yeah earlier this week I think
on Monday and she rolls up she's like
three minutes late so she's not like
super late or anything it's not the end
of the world but she's a couple minutes
late which is already bad manners
everyone else is in like suits and she
pulls up she's in her yoga pants she
walks out of this car and she's just
like this is this is ridiculous
like we can't we can't we can't do this
anymore so the hidden purpose of this
dream now that I've explained exactly
what happened to my car like I couldn't
I couldn't even get the back clean like
look at this there's so much like
confetti and stuff on here it's like
it's like a pollution hazard like it's
ridiculous so the hidden purpose of this
stream is a couple of things number one
is I am ready to reveal the replacement
for the Lambo I bought a new car today
number two actually have multiple hidden
purposes to this stream number two is I
would like to hear from you guys what
should we do with the Lambo we've got a
few options there's a local shooting
range that we could take it to and we
could just take the whole team out there
record a channel super fun and shoot the
crap out of it you know ten points if
you can break a window 30 points if you
can knock off a mirror all that kind of
fun stuff so that's an option
another option is there's the place down
in like Vegas or something I think I
forget exactly where it is but it
probably would be Vegas where you can
hire an Abrams tank and you can drive
over a car of your choice with the tank
so that might be kind of a fun option
I've had a lot of people ask why don't
you why don't you
sell it or why don't you donate as a
charity or something like that and the
reason that I wouldn't want to do that
is I actually have legitimate safety
concerns about driving this vehicle so
for years now it's had one here on this
other side two three at least three I
thought there were four a couple of them
might have joined here's oh yeah four
it's had four cracks and or deep chips
in the windshield each of which
individually would be enough to
disqualify this from being safely driven
on the road because it does affect the
structural integrity of the vehicle
especially if it were to be hit from the
front and the cost of replacing a
windshield on a vehicle like this is
vastly greater than the actual cost of
the vehicle itself so I couldn't in good
conscience provide this vehicle to
someone especially with the amount of
work that would be required to get it
street-legal
that's something I'm actually a little
disappointed in our community about we
had like two rules rule number one was
have fun
rule number two was keep it street-legal
and we ended up with some we ended up
with some cuss words we ended up with
most of the windows like most of the
windows looked basically like this this
is one that I didn't bother to clean and
then the back the the front windshield
was probably a little better than this
but not as dissimilar as you might hope
all these lights had to be had to be
scraped off that took that took quite a
while although it was easier before the
paint was totally dry that's another
thing that was kind of my tipping point
was I I accidentally left my window open
like just a sliver so a little bit of
water dripped in and some of it got on
this like this goop Daan glue that
someone put here on the door handle and
it kind of went wet again because of the
water and I got it all over my hands and
I was like you know what this is this is
just kind of my limit so so right so
back to ulterior ulterior motive of the
stream number whatever it was
oh yeah sure hit me with a super jet
another $50 $50 super chat Wow yeah what
to say hi hi Cleve Greene it's ok
because you love the channel what's ok
just everything's ok
oh that we relate ah yes ok
Kris Bennett says don't buy a Tesla
well the decision sort of already made
that the car has been sitting just out
of frame this entire time so I guess
we'll see what else you got
warning twitch has an exclusivity clause
knots okay we'll be fine yeah
don't worry about it if twitch kicks us
off then twitch kicks us off like
whatever it's fine Scott Scott trainer
alright so everyone super chats and not
super chats oh there's a train whatever
that's like the excitement train
everybody get on board so I bought a
whole
it's mmm the what effect
oh nothing we can do about that now
should be fine now we're going the other
way so why did I buy a Chevy Volt I'm
sure a lot of you are kind of wondering
because that wasn't one of the cars that
I was talking about it's definitely not
the most exciting car in the world by a
longshot but here's the reason so
something that probably I hope a lot of
you know is that while I am a tech guy I
had a lot of people say well you're a
tech guy just get a Tesla and I was like
oh yeah I mean they're basically rolling
computers which is pretty cool there are
some there are some issues with sort of
Tesla in general I'm not a huge fan of
what they're doing in terms of right to
repair access to replacement parts
honestly though when it comes to just
picking the product I want and and then
using it and enjoying it
that's not the kind of thing that I'm
typically gonna like make a stand about
you know oh you guys don't provide tools
to third-party repair centers I'm you
know I wouldn't even consider you but it
was definitely a factor I don't think
that I'm ready for all-electric yet so I
do have an all gas vehicle I also have a
2016 Honda Odyssey minivan so that's our
sort of you know family family wagon but
and so I did consider all electric but I
just I'm not sure from ready to make the
plunge and some of the plug-in hybrids
these days one of the ones I was looking
at was the Honda clarity and this was
one of the other ones I ended up looking
at have make a pretty compelling case
for me in particular so I live about 20
kilometers from work so as long as I get
a car that even once you factor in you
don't have to really worry about cell
degradation because the way that they
configure these things there is so much
extra battery capacity in them that
they've built in like a good five to ten
years depending on the manufacturer sort
of exactly what it is but they've built
in a good 5 to 10 years of battery
degradation so
just grab more reserve battery life and
start presenting it to you they never
let you fill it all the way like I think
this one is something like 75% to 30% is
all it really allows you to do it
doesn't even let you charge it all the
way and that's best for the health of
the car
and that's something that we actually
talked about in a recent video where we
said that you need to stop or stop
charging your phone overnight you guys
can check that out same basic principles
so worrying about battery degradation
isn't really a huge thing until after I
think it's like 10 years with this one
but you do have to account for cold
weather so this one does I think it's
something like a 50 mile range so that
works that doesn't like what's 75 or 80
kilometers or something like that
whatever that converts to I think it's
about 80 85 kilometers under sort of EPA
rated conditions and so for me in the
cold where you're gonna probably take a
30% hit that means that I'll be able to
get to work I could do a short errand
and then I could get back from work all
on battery without burning gas and the
only time I'll really burn gas is if I
need to drive down to Richmond for for
badminton or something like that
all of that while I'm still getting the
benefit of a gasoline engine so it
doesn't have some of the sex appeal of
some of the OL electrics where you can 0
to 60 in 5 seconds or you know you can
well you never have to visit a gas
station ever again but for me I'll be
driving it all-electric probably a good
80 to 85 percent of the time so that on
top of incentives that you can get for
installing electric charges Chargers at
work so we're gonna install some
electric Chargers here at the office
Brandon's gonna be pretty happy so late
means that I can start charging up at
work where the company pays for charging
for some reason I'm sure they're gonna
find a way around that at some point
figure out that people are going to be
abusing the heck out of Chargers at
their offices or at malls or whatever
else the case may be on I'm sure they're
gonna make some progress there because
there's taxation implications right if
someone's actually getting all of their
fuel from a charger at work after it
once it gets over I think it's like a
couple hundred dollars it becomes a
taxable benefit anyway that's that's all
like sort of corporate management speak
that you guys probably don't really care
about but some anyway
I'll be taking advantage of that for now
so I'll be charging it up at work and I
don't know what else can I really tell
you guys about it I stuck with my mo
which is as you can see this is not a
brand new car I actually in my life have
only bought a brand spanking new car one
time that was the minivan and that was
because I planned to drive that thing
for 10 to 15 years and minivans because
there's such a commodity item like
nobody buys a minivan on an impulse
because they're like passionate about
minivans and I'm sure someone did but
for the most part no one does that so
they tend to follow pretty much a
formula for pricing where however much
usable life is left on it as some kind
of function of how old it is is the
price so a new one actually ended up
being a better deal than a fairly recent
used one whereas for the most part
that's not the case so one of these this
is an LT 2017 so the current equivalent
it's got leather seats and the bose
sound upgrade but nothing else no other
extras so one of these would probably be
somewhere in the neighborhood of around
40 I want to say 41 or 42 thousand
Canadian dollars plus that stupid fee
that the dealerships charge use like
five six hundred sometimes as much as
$1,000 depending where you go so Plus
that fee plus taxes so this one has
29,000 kilometers on it so that would be
what about 20,000 miles and it cost me
thirty one thousand plus the six hundred
bucks for the fee so basically I saved
about ten thousand dollars a quarter of
the price of the car and the way that I
calculated I figure any car consumer
grade vehicle has probably a usable
lifespan of about two hundred thousand
to two hundred like two hundred and
forty thousand kilometers before you
start getting into ok time for a new
transmission although I don't know it
only has one gear ratio I don't know
exactly how that works in here but time
for a new transmission time to start
actually replacing some significant
things and your upkeep cost starts to
become noticeable and you have to be
taking it into the shop more frequently
or repairing it sidelining it more
frequently so the way that I see it
I've still got a good it's only used up
maybe what one seventh to one eighth of
its usable life but I got a quarter of
the price off
so I don't know you guys want to see the
inside did you wanted me to open up the
other door you can poke your head in
that way let's do that what's that yeah
sure you can hit me with two yep all
right so this was a purely pragmatic
decision this was sort of the most
electric car I could get for the least
amount of money overall actually
especially I heard people talk about how
Tesla's don't have amazing interiors for
the price that you pay and I but I'd
never really like side by side compared
them riding around and Brendan's Model X
it doesn't feel like you know that's a
car that's you know three times I would
pay three times as much for that
interior finish like honestly it's like
fine and okay do you want any with those
super shots now Daniel Warren votes for
the tank all right Daniel duly noted see
Bart interesting propositions so see
Bart wants us to do the shooting range
first then the tank okay I actually we
could do that but I think there's an
issue and that's that we would probably
want to drive it down to Vegas for the
tank and I don't think it would be
street-legal anymore once we everyone
had their add their way with it with
with a rifle word or tan gun or whatever
the case may be we could drive it there
then shoot it then run it over with a
tank that's not a bad option then we
could just tow it from the shooting
range to the to the desert all right hit
me with one more leo says painted pink
okay so actually I'm glad you mentioned
that
all right so right interior so I don't
have OnStar or whatever so the built in
navigation doesn't work that's kind of
annoying
you
you
how do you say okay regenerative braking
so I like that there's different modes
for regenerative braking and anyway all
of this all of this actually got me
thinking you know we have not done a
particularly amazing job of addressing
the car technology segment over the
years and part of the reason has been
that engaging with car brands has been
I'm not going to name any names because
some of them have actually been great
some of them have been really good among
the best brands we've ever dealt with
and some of the others have been just an
absolute nightmare to deal with and
that's one of the reasons that we really
haven't approached doing car videos from
sort of a technological standpoint
because I think it is something that our
viewers would like and feel free to let
us know in the comments if you agree or
if you disagree and it is something that
I think we'd have a lot of fun doing and
honestly I actually had a blast shopping
for this car generally speaking I don't
really like shopping but you know there
was there were so many different things
to consider so many speeds and feeds so
many trim models so many different
things about the shopping experience
Chevy's shopping experience I mean I
went to a couple different dealers one
where I was looking at a new one and
then one where they had this one can can
be all over the place one of them was
great and actually didn't end up being
the one that I bought from because they
only had new cars and one of them was
absolutely terrible like it was really
annoying it was classic car salesman
with the whole stupid like well you know
check that price with my manager and
then they come back and they give you a
different one you get like the sales
sheet has like seven lines on it before
the final price because it's just
designed to do this stupid back and
forth and I'm kind of sitting here going
stop wasting my time just just tell me
the price of the vehicle so there's a
lot of things that from sort of just
like a general consumer buying a car
standpoint that don't get covered and we
hate dealing with car brands so it led
me to an interesting conclusion and the
reason that I don't plan to paint this
car pink I think we should start doing
car reviews but we should do them in a
really different way so some of you will
remember this back when back when we
originally started doing phone videos I
think I've
probably told you guys this but I had
never actually purchased a smartphone in
my life I had only ever been issued them
through work and I wasn't really a
smartphone guy so the way that I really
approached it rather than knowing all
the right benchmarks to run and and all
the different sort of software settings
and and features to look for I just
would use them I just start using them
and I'd go well here's some things I
liked here some things I didn't and I
made a lot of mistakes along the way but
I also think it gave our phone videos
sort of a unique perspective and what I
got to thinking was well this was a lot
of fun shopping for this car and I hate
dealing with car manufacturers but I
would like to do car videos so maybe
what we should do is we should approach
them really differently I'm not gonna
try to pretend to be a car expert but
what I'll do is I'm gonna buy this car
I'm gonna drive it for a month so you
guys can expect in about a month to six
weeks time to see a video on the Chevy
Volt the 2017 model is very similar to
the 2018 so there's not not a huge
difference there to speak of so it'll be
it'll be about this car and then what I
think we're gonna do if we can figure it
out from a taxation standpoint is we are
going to sell this car immediately we
might even have a link so we just have a
link under the video where people can
see the listing yeah then someone in our
community can buy it maybe we could do
like an exclusive merchandise thing we
could do like a like a plaque you could
get a plaque with it that has like like
a golden album kind of like a CD and it
could be like the LTTE drivers CD and
you could be an ltte driver get it
because drivers anyway well we'll figure
out some way to make it kind of special
and so someone can buy the car the know
exactly where it came from and who owned
it and then we'll let the community vote
and they can tell us what they want to
see next there's some really interesting
stuff coming in Haeundae just announced
something I know Jaguar has the eyepiece
coming yeah yeah the kkona yeah who's
that is that Hyundai yeah so Hyundai has
that coming so anyway let me know in the
comments on this video what you guys
think and I guess I guess that's pretty
much it that's the purpose of the stream
that's what happened to my car and this
is this is it this is it this is rippln
blam bow
the plates are off baby plates are off
no no it's day it's just gonna stay here
until we shoot it up or blow it up or
drive over it with the tank or whatever
the case may be it's done that's it it's
actually it's been kind of uh that's
been kind of bittersweet actually
because this car has gotten me to many
many places over many many years and
like I said I'm not really a car guy but
I'm certainly I like my stuff that's
been good to me kind of guy and it's it
served me very very well but I'm just
I've just kind of had enough of like you
know this sort of this sort of thing you
know so that's pretty much it guys this
video is brought to you by PI a private
Internet access is the VPN that's
basically a VPN it's just a good one so
it masks your location so that the
services that you use online and the
sites that you use can't tell where
you're from
it keeps any information from leaking
out to advertisers or other folks who
might want to track you or profit from
your data
they've got servers they've got
thousands of servers and what is it like
28 different countries all over the
world and their rates are affordable so
go check them out that's I don't
remember our vanity URL but we're gonna
have that linked in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you dislike this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured hey we need to get an affiliate
link for these things if people are
gonna actually run out and like buy cars
I don't know how does that work BIOS on
Amazon anyway also link down there
emerge torch has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join and we should
probably do a handful more Super chats
don't give me the dollar amounts just
names and messages se says Linus have
you thought about installing solar and
using that to charge it and absolutely
we have thought about doing solar here
at the office so we've got all the way
from this end of the building here all
the way to the bay on the left of the
Linus Media Group's sign and then the
whole thing is probably I think it's
about 40 or 50 feet deep something like
that so we've got that whole roof area
up there
the issue though is that a it's got kind
of a faux front on it for one thing so
you because of the angle of the Sun a
lot of times a year we're gonna lose
probably a good 10% of the roof space to
that and then the other issue is that we
live in the Pacific Northwest so you
only really get four to five months a
year of real bona fide sunlight and that
tends to make it pretty difficult to
offset the cost what I actually want to
do if anyone out there like works
closely with a solar installer or solar
panel supplier or something like that is
I'd love to work something out where we
do like a bunch of content around it
like what I what I really want to do
what we've been trying to do since we
moved in here is whole building solar
solar panel setup so where we actually
get the whole company and we try to do
it ourselves and kind of bungle our way
through it like a whole room water
cooling like vlog style I think would be
a really fun way to to really talk about
the real life challenges of getting a
solar panel installation going so I
think something like that would be fun
just for those who are messaging about
it already don't worry we're not gonna
actually like hook up high voltage lines
ourselves we like have an electrician
who's cool and will come in and like
help us with that stuff don't worry okay
what else you got Ryan says keep it blue
yeah I was kind of thinking maybe like
like if we do something with vinyl then
that doesn't affect whoever gets it next
right so we could just do like like ltte
orange racing stripes up it or something
like that like that'd be pretty cool
josh says hood is a set piece for Rancho
huh probably not we're probably gonna do
an show inside because it's gonna be
it's we have enough challenges to solve
before when show today with this dual
streaming thing anything else okay one
more
gareth says thermite plus Lambo yeah
hydraulic press Channel hmm now that's
an interesting one I don't even think it
would fit in there press I've seen that
channel alright see you guys go ahead
and cut me
