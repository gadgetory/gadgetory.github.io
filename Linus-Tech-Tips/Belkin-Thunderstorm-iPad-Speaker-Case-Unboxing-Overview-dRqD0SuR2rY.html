now to learn more this my friends is the
Belkin thunderstorm which their branding
as a handheld home theater and if you
check out their website they claim this
is the loudest iPad case now not the
loudest iPad dock because obviously you
can put an iPad or iPod into like any
number of massive things these days
which for some reason people buy but
it's inexplicable to me but anyway docks
are apparently a thing but no this is an
actual iPad case so Belkin partnered up
with odda Phi to make this particular
product possible and while from what
I've seen the audio quality might not be
the best thing you ever heard which
makes sense because it is extremely low
profile for speakers which have just
sort of physical restraints on them in
terms of you know how much sound they
can produce and how great it can be in
terms of their actual size it's
apparently not bad either so here is the
iPad case itself this particular one is
designed for iPads Gen 1 and Gen 2 and
they do have a separate option for other
more different iPads so the way your
iPad fits in I actually happen to have
yeah this has been missing for a while I
just found my iPad so I'm like super
stoked on that so I'm gonna go ahead and
take it out of its existing case which
is just a slimline case that does not
have speakers so it is definitely
quieter than this one so all you do is
throw the iPad in there
I don't throw gently place then lock it
in place with the dock connector down
there so now it's all you know what I
don't think I got it quite in hold on
yeah okay well let's find out how to
pull it out then there you go so you
just pull in it and then you try again
ah now it's in there so you just got to
get it under the lip here so the iPad
should be reasonably well protected so
there's kind of a smart coveri looking
cover on it they've got apparently some
information for the user something about
an FCC statement and
industry canada and whatnot and whatever
oh look at that they have instructions
for this so there's instructions on the
back that tell you everything that I
just told you you can download an app
the Thunder app lets you select the
optimum audio setting maybe we should do
that we'll be back in a moment all right
so we installed the app which promptly
prompted us to update the firmware
actually of the device itself so the app
does not too much basically what it
allows you to do is change the stereo
separation so they have suggested
settings for games music movies and
voice chats and then it also allows you
to preview your settings with a built-in
audio clip so they actually use sort of
airports throughout the device I
shouldn't say airports like like ports
for air not like
you know like planes and stuff like that
not airports but that's basically what
allows it to achieve its base enos and
it's not bad audio quality let me put it
this way is as good or better than those
little like you know Bluetooth speakers
you can get like the jam box it destroys
the jam box I can say that much I'm not
a big fan of the jam box by jawbone but
something like an antique sp1 I'd say
it's probably similar maybe even a touch
louder than the sp1 and something I
didn't cover yet before is that the way
that this folds gives you the option to
have a couple of different angles for it
so you can fold it like that or you can
fold it like it that and it can sort of
sit in various different ways
depending on what you prefer so let's go
ahead and play it
so that's maximum volume and I'm talking
what I consider to be sort of a louder
than normal speaking voice which should
give you some idea how loud this thing
is and yeah like I said okay audio
quality not perfect but is it more
practical if you use your iPad for
watching movies and listening to music
at the beach or whatever else very very
frequently than something like a
Bluetooth speaker perhaps it is bulky so
you're taking something that is sleek
and slim like the iPad and you're
turning it into a bit of a brick you do
have to remember to charge it however
should be noted that you don't have to
keep it open all the time so this is
something I didn't notice before but the
speaker kind of pokes through the front
cover here and it will at as well will
if nothing else also keep your iPad from
getting damaged so it's quite thick on
the back so that's sort of the flipside
of that accessing the headphone port
looks like it's gonna be a bit of a
challenge if your headphones use a right
angle connector however if they use a
straight connector you should be fine
you charge it here the lock button is
here your other more different rotation
lock buttons here volume up and down is
there and then you can it looks like
you're actually gonna have to pop it out
in order to access the dock connector so
this is more like the kind of thing that
you'd keep in your beach bag and for
your iPad in when it's the appropriate
time this also disconnects magnetically
as you would expect if you're a Smart
Cover user which I am not so I was not
expecting that if you liked the video
click like the video if you just liked
the video click dislike the video if you
were totally impartial to the video then
I guess go join the Linus tech tips comm
forum because it's awesome then you can
discuss your impartiality with the other
people there who will definitely want to
talk to you don't forget to subscribe -
