little bit curious this is a watch from
Tokyo flash you can basically they they
pm'd me on youtube there were like oh we
have these watches and we'd like you to
have a look at them you know see if see
if there's one that you think is neat
and we'll send it to you for your
impression so here it is I actually
don't remember anymore which one I
picked but here so you can check out
their site so they have over here they
have a bunch of just sort of neat unique
watches some of them have like touch
screens some of them are led like they
will show the numbers and kind of cool
ways like this looks really confusing at
first but then the way you read it is
it's one two three hours 45 minutes
pretty cool huh so yeah they've got a
bunch of different styles and actually
this might this might have been the one
that this might have been the one that I
picked anyway okay so Oh rumble brought
me a mouse to throw from hey want it
come on okay alright so here's what we
have in terms of packaging but mousepad
no I go can take it got okay change the
way you think about time nice packaging
overall a little tab here to open it up
got a manual here oh yeah there that's
that's the one that thought I ended up
picking so I hope there's something in
English on the other side aha excellent
okay so includes an instruction manual
how to read the date and time it's good
that they include those instructions how
to set the date and time in the
animation checking and setting the alarm
recharging the battery and oh yeah you
actually charged these you charge this
particular model with your with USB so
you don't have to worry about replacing
watch batteries or about winding it that
comes with a couple little things comes
with a screwdriver
a little extra screw here and also comes
with the USB charging cable so you go
just one of those five volt cables wow
it's quite so quite solid quite solid
and heavy actually that's uh huh there
you go there you go guys just opens up
like that you know what give me a second
to peel all the plastic bits off so
let's start with the setup process guys
you just hold the a button in order to
get into setting mode so I've already
set the date as well as the time
remember guys there's 12 months as well
as 12 hours so it uses the same odd 12
lines around the outside of the watch in
order to display the data on the time so
this is just it saying okay yes we're
done setting up everything so you press
this button to see the time so you can
see it's 1125 right now which happens to
be right excellent and then you press
this one to see the date which at this
point is the oops hold on 12 through
fourth month and it is the sixth of
April and then you can press it again to
see what time your alarm is set for and
then turn it off two buttons it's a
little bit big for me right now as you
can see but it can be easily sighs so
you just go ahead and open it up you can
see that there's a little bits in there
that you can knock out and then put
fewer or more links into it I just want
to give you guys like a closer look at
the at the watch itself I hope you have
enough light so it's got a very dark
metallic finish actually has quite a lot
of quite a lot of weight to it feels
really good class feels pretty solid
kind of need actually there's the model
name can you see it is it caught in the
light and of course my camera picks this
time to not focus can you see it now
yeah okay so there you go guys it's 11
26 now got to eat actually sorry guys
something I missed is the there's a
screw covering the port to recharge it
so you won't have to recharge it that
but whenever you do you do have to
unscrew it the reason they have a screw
on theirs because there is a seal around
the outside so it's not going to be
waterproof by any stretch of the
imagination guys but if you you're
sweating or whatever you don't want just
various random debris getting into the
charging hole so that light indicates
charging and I think we're pretty much
done here so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the key
say I don't forget that you can check
them out on tokyoflash phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
