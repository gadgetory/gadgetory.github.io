get shanked with a thread Ripper like
torque yeah I know
yeah and you're gonna be the first
person to ever get shanked with one
welcome to the livestream he wouldn't
start the stream so if you're wondering
why the stream is late well okay that
sort of depends what you're wondering if
you're wondering why the stream is
taking place at such a late hour that is
because it is sponsored out the freakin
wazoo by madrenas madrenas they make
coffee cold brew coffee fees more
different regular coffees and now now
for the first time for the first time
ever they make a Linus tech tips coffee
roast yes my friends in fact I've got a
bunch of information from Colton about
the coffee roast that I will not be
reading because you know what Colton
that guy's fired or rather roasted
lightly fired and delicious just like
our roast so for December 1st through
7th offer coat Linus over on madrenas is
going to be bumped to 50% off is that
correct yes 50% off Thank You Pam
everyone who pre-orders the Linus tech
tips roast is going to get a free Linus
sticker really yeah yes anyone even want
that cute sticker dude all right all
right all right whatever ah the lambo
micro roast will fuel the roast of Linus
and we'll have more information about
that later that's a sort of an optional
talking point okay look we might be
doing a roast but like not a coffee
roast like a roast of me but then like
sponsored by madrina so it's like a
coffee roast but whatever you guys get
the point we're gonna have slo-mo as a
moderator on our live stream on YouTube
we're gonna be hosting something our
twitch channel on their twitch channel
coffee for fuel and during the stream
and that's just today right the first 50
people who pre-order will get an
additional bag for free is that right
yes cool all right so what are we
actually doing today though um our
writing staff needs new workstations
and the reason for that is that quite
often Oh in the course of us making
videos they have to work with 8k footage
and Alex how's that experience without
10 gig Ethernet and on an underpowered
workstation it's not even an experience
it's just like you see a frame and then
it's like a dial-up internet like three
minutes later you get like the next one
yeah yes it's about like that so that's
like one-eighth quality you can't even
do like more than that so we had some
some good friends of ours are you
keeping track of like who's systems each
one is and stuff Jake are you just
you're just grabbing random stuff and
yeah you know he tries to help but he's
young you know he he's young he tries he
tries her oh thank you just throwing
throwing SSDs dropping them on the table
you know who taught you how to tack
anyway okay cheese so you've done a very
good job of bringing over this system
but we're actually gonna start with busy
391 because that one has kind of a
cooler hardware Thank You Jake
good work Jake here Alex can you help
them take that down there I'm just gonna
I'm gonna stand here how's the video all
right so our goal today and Colton
doesn't believe in us our goal today is
actually Jake can you go over there and
operate the camera so they can see cool
thanks Jake our goal today is to build
an Alex can you go back over there and
grab the parts so that Jay can operate
the camera our goal today is to build
three workstations and Colton doesn't
believe no no you don't to do that just
leave it on the sticks what do you are
you crazy
are you crazy okay well there's the
piles of workstations our goal today is
to build three workstations and Colton
Colton doesn't believe in us Colton
Colton doesn't think look I believe in
you guys I just don't know how long
it'll take there's a prompter in your
face
let's Lynn I don't think you guys can
build three systems in 120 minutes I
just don't think you have Colton home
call it's me and Alex okay so when you
said yield all right all right all right
so let's start we're gonna bring the z3
96
I didn't know I thought it was just
modeling the kinds of know what why
would why would I hire you to do that so
which ones this this is Jean you were
hired for your mad tech skills that
Colton for whatever reason that guy
doesn't believe in I mean you could
model stuff if you wanted actually
you're a handsome
you're handsome gentleman okay although
what I'm what I am actually wondering
about though so this one's for James is
it yeah apparently okay but that's what
I here's for me look why because
workstations but then like what does
Ivan get ah his laptop still right look
okay okay what about we build Ivan a
desktop and then I just keep my okay
that's still quite good okay what are
you running right now
6900 K and Quadro yeah yes you're the
one with the 6500 K yeah we're looking
for that we've been looking for that for
a long freakin time
yes just man okay so okay couple things
here first of all everyone's getting
r-tx graphics cards apparently Jake are
you having trouble over there should I
switch to chai just switch to the other
the other angle here like what's the
Jesus what's the other one oh lordy what
what just happened what just happened
what am I even switching right now I'm
not yeah I don't I didn't know you're
not supposed to click the button you do
it in OBS oh okay well I thought they
were I don't know I thought they were
bound to something look okay look I know
this stream is a total bull crap fest so
far but like well not crap fest crap
fest makes it sound like bad I think
it's pretty entertaining so far it
smells very good with all those cones
yeah the word I was looking for was poop
demonstration you know but like the less
yeah the less pee first you know like
it's an accent and s can you stop
tilting the camera you're gonna make
everybody date this is awful
it's an awful experience okay okay so
here's what we have to decide so the
people who actually need work stations
then are who Ivan James and
and panthan it yeah okay so which one of
them gets the hardware that we requested
from a suits we actually I sent them an
email this is really funny so I sent a
seasoned team I was like yo
we're building up some workstations for
the writers who need them because
they're reviewing 8k footage and from
time to time they may actually end up
plunking things onto the timeline rather
than just annotating timestamps that are
relevant to help the editors sorry okay
yeah we really useful that would be like
really really good
we need to okay you can stay like more
Center you've got a drift all right I
also need coffee so I'm you explain this
and I'm gonna make coffee and then the
body of the email was like I mean other
boards graphics oh yeah ten gig Knicks
would be cool and they're like okay
great
so they send over a motherboard a
graphics card and I don't know how to
operate this I just got it it's it's a
it's a grinder but it's it's not
grinding things so they only sent over
one of their newsy 390 pro WS board that
looks sexy as hell so who gets bored oh
I did it
yeah everyone's really happy
oh we're probably about good there we go
390 Pro and the 9900 cake or i9 for
their workstation do we just want to RN
jeah oh my god pin off have they been
able to hear me at all
through alex is like yeah on that that's
actually a thing we have actually filmed
videos where I've had a co-host and my
bike is just like off the whole time and
we've just kind of been like yeah if we
kind of cut around this we can just use
yeah we can we can just use we can just
grab why this is audio off this other
microphone this has to be the single
most extra making device oh it is so
good in my life it's basically like a
brown that looks recycled coffee filter
and I'm having treat this coffee
properly oh look at that
oh man it's getting all nice and foamy
that means it's fresh yeah it does yeah
cuz like you know you don't get the
foaminess with old coffee we can keep
this dream going I hope you guys were
able to hear this story anyway
no let's just let's just decide no
random number generator we are going to
choose favorites
Ivan James or Anthony who's our favorite
I mean it's not really even favorite cuz
like the other guys are getting thread
Ripper 1950 exes but who gets that sweet
single thread performance for when they
stay in game afterwards because they're
also gonna have our TX 2070 graphics
cards because we need like really good
screen capture for high quality HD
Hardware h.264 encoder whatever doesn't
matter you know what I pick Anthony okay
good okay
so let's build Anthony's system first so
Colton mister non-believer over there
yeah
why don't you set why don't you set a
timer okay sure also some timer sir
why don't you see why don't we see how
long it takes me and Alex to build this
system because I guarantee you it is not
very long and that's even gonna be with
his stupid boy once a simmer for all of
them we're gonna build them all but you
can time one and you can extrapolate
it's called math the copper build what
do you mean keep the copper building oh
you are not keeping the copper building
you are not keeping the copper build as
a workstation 1080i Alex have you looked
on the car it's an 85 on the coffee here
the coffee is in the coffee maker you
can take you guys ready I can count you
dinner yeah fine all right best of luck
gentlemen how do we just swing that
three two I know I didn't I agreed in
front of 12 people right let's build
let's go
it just seemed unreasonable that's why
you did it if you did all right so we're
gonna save ourselves some time by
getting everything ready so we got our
i/o shield it's crazy how few
motherboard accessories you had you want
to give them an angle on this it's crazy
how few motherboard accessories you
actually need to build a system any more
SATA cable say who needs SATA cables
anymore we're going MDOT - who needs
like this is like a rear panel USB -
thing who needs that more SATA cables
SLI lol SLI so dead CPU installation you
got to be kidding me
like how RGB okay RGB maybe you need
that you got what
serial oh there's a serial lead yeah
sure why not
you got three wait you got other more
different to way you got 4 Way SLI and
who needs any of this stuff you don't
need any of that you got your i/o shield
colton go why are you here why are you
here Colton are you are you interfering
with our stream I can't even see you
they can't even see
look at this guy look at this guy if you
switch to the wives oh oh right here you
are the world's biggest chill no.1 look
at this hat oh look at this madrenas
happy really cool
yeah the heats not on we have everything
on a schedule no one's no one's supposed
to be in the office at this time it's
it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
all right look at this board look at
this board okay give me give me the
other hand give me the overhead again
it's beautiful look at this board is
that beautiful boooo-eeep in you got you
four slots you got your Utah - you got
your other more different you - you got
your MDOT to your other MDOT - you got
your USB 3.1 you got your USB 3.0 also
one but not like the type-c variety -
eight pin powers it's beautiful matte
black PCB like why isn't everything
matte black remember my mother boards
were the color of cardboard that was
stupid
why did we ever accept that that list
that was unacceptable all right so CPUs
in so Colton how many components does a
system have yeah cuz I've already
installed one of them Corsair sent over
this Ram you know we're building serious
workstations so naturally we will be
needing Vengeance Pro RGB this is 16
gigs actually maybe because you actually
do things that could actually 32 gigs of
ram people were asking for 32 but like
pretty expensive
I know Rams tough to get these days yeah
I think the shortage is pretty much over
I think it's like it's yeah Ram is still
pretty pretty expensive but how much RAM
do people yet they get 16 gigs yeah you
probably already do have 64 gigs but
that might actually need more RAM whoo
they can't see you they can't even see
you do all right 64 gigs
I think I actually have 64 gigs in my
row and that there is a freakin no
reason for whatsoever so you normally
have like 30 gigs of tabs open though so
that's actually possibly true though no
all right let's go ahead and get this m
dot 2 installed here like I can't
believe Colton doesn't think that we can
in stuff that we can build three systems
in two hours yeah I'm going to start
putting the power supply in here how can
he even be a sales guy at Linus Media
Group when he clearly doesn't believe
did you say those systems are three I
said three okay okay okay three what do
you think this is some like chump you
know can't build three systems in two
hours stuff I think either of us you
yeah there Joey
yeah you're totally allowed to drink the
madrenas that is like literally the
entire point of today this is the point
yeah you can take the mug oh the point
is that this is the coffee fueled stream
in case you guys missed it I don't know
if you guys can tell me but I actually
hate that no you know it's not as bad as
which one's the one that makes me like
really like it just makes my skin crawl
beer beer commercials when they just
have like the like the like look look
look pouring noise oh I hate it can't
even can't even listen to it
that's awful all right trying to build
the computer right all right I guess I
should say we have an RM 1,000 X from
Corsair for the power supply yep 500 D
for the case where Sarah's pretty chill
I sent all this stuff over very quickly
to heart you course it yeah oh man you
were so disorganized about this we've
been planning this dream for so long and
then on like Monday yeah on Monday I I
II like email Corsair and I'm like and
Asus and Intel Intel sent over the one
CPU
there was no so I email all those guys
I'm like yo we're doing this thing we're
doing like a live stream it's gonna be
crazy it's gonna be awesome
can you send over hardware and they're
like when is it and I'm like yo it's on
like Friday and I lied I lied I said
Friday because it was gonna be on
Saturday and I knew that if I told them
I was gonna be on Saturday they they try
and do Saturday delivery or some weird
stuff so they can buy themselves some
more time but you can't deliver on
Saturdays to our office so that would be
a bad scene okay so Colton um just so
you know I now have the CPU RAM and I'm
about to have the cooler installed
because okay unlike some people I can
build a computer pretty fast yeah okay I
think Derek some people would say a
challenge I think you're taking your PC
building skills and you're kind of
projecting them five pcs okay five pcs
yes five pcs to Luke kind of pretty much
built but yeah yeah that's kind of what
I thought all right that's kind of what
I thought all right let's get this
section firm can you adjust the angle of
this camera at all yeah there's a hole
there's a whole lot of floor organized
yeah we were not that disorganized
madrenas is very organized and when I
talked to Alex I was like hey Lodi
thinks the writers workstations deep do
you guys need anything for this Alex
goes now we're good okay cool man and
then I find out we're not good
we need parts no we yeah would be
totally fine like those thread rippers
we just had those sitting around we
don't really need them we were just like
yeah we're like now we have them I also
didn't know J Colton that you were going
to be sabotaging this build Oh Oh what
did I do
yeah because one of my spacers for my
cool at my Knoxville cooler here is
missing so we legitimately need another
spacer for yeah one of those plastic
spacers
I don't trust Colton to find something
like that Jake do you think you can
track one for me Wow would really
appreciate it
thanks bud no this is just an Intel
I don't know NH something I think we
have oh wait you walked away without
changing the stream back to the wide so
we're just staring at this desk that's
fine I can do it I know how to do it I
know how to do it it's all good it's all
good we got this beautiful yeah so I
think there's a knock to a heat sink
parts graveyard if you want to check
there before you scavenge it from
another cooler that would be very much
appreciated because this is how we run
into these problems people just scavenge
some other tool what do you mean you
don't know where it is it's for all the
graveyards are it's over in the corner
with all the cable dang it Jake you're
killing me here how's that going
that's almost in I think there's a nod
to a cooler parts graveyard I'm actually
not sure it seems like the kind of thing
there should be a graveyard for because
like anything we use all the time the
accessories get kind of scattered to the
high winds and we end up kind of just
finding bits and pieces of them and
they're very recognizable Noctua parts
so we just like create a place where you
put all the natural parts that you just
move you're not sure what they go with I
can't hear you there's no knock to a one
yeah I wasn't actually sure if there was
a knock to a one oh I'm having too much
fun right now like I shouldn't be
allowed to have this much fun at work
but then again it is like is it Saturday
it is set what yeah here because Colton
hashtag blame Colton can't blame me for
everything okay I can blame you for this
yeah this is totally yours like actually
your fault that we are honestly I just
want to hang out with you guys you don't
dress that and they're like you know
let's enter let's move this coffee roast
launch let's make this happen I don't
want to use ash same size spacing well
where's the Intel one it's right there
it's right there it's right there just
there okay so here's the oh it feels
empty no this is this is Mountain
well don't you know you can't do that oh
goodness
you're standing right in the audience's
way here just look I pretty much yeah
you think why would they include another
set of AMD specific spacers for all the
people who buy one cooler and install it
at the same time on two different
classes just to accommodate those people
unreal Jake you have a garbage can
around I needed to toss the toss the
chummy oh and if you were wondering how
we end up with graveyard parts okay so
Colton you're actively sabotaging this
process the bets off but we're still
gonna we're still gonna beat your yeah
we're gonna absolutely crush it thing
yeah it's how long depends so Parks this
is like most of the way built yeah 11
minutes you're gonna get rekt so hard I
hope you didn't promise madrenas that
this was gonna be a two-hour stream
because we are gonna crush you think
what no what what's that what the oh
what oh well someone just mixed messed
it all up and there were only three in
there who's putting only three spaces no
I didn't know no one put stuff in there
unbelievable how hard is it to put all
the accessories you know what the cooler
the cooler for my test bench
it's an H Adi from corset I have been
using it since we moved into this office
for my test bench and I put it away and
there was like one radiator screw
missing I put it away just the other
dance which an air cooling from my
husband what do you mean they're easy to
find exactly that's exactly it I was
only missing one piece after using that
thing for a year literally years how
hard is this but no one can keep this
stuff together do you want to switch to
the to the build for a second here
you're kind of like the producer Jake I
thought that was supposed to be Colton
I used to be cool like man you know what
we have any super chats Colton
yeah Colton are you even reading the
super chats oh hold on I need to get
some thermal compound what's the
quickest people yeah I kind of wanted to
use those those pads do we have any of
those pads down downstairs they're all
upstairs yeah I know I bummed up I
banged up my knee though all right I'm
gonna go get them oh I'm gonna get
stronger all right how is your night
stream I don't know if Linus is talking
right now probably yeah kind of missed
it when we when they first tuned in we
are or we have partnered up with
madrenas to launch our own coffee roast
so you guys get the Linus tech tips
lambo micro roast on madrenas coffee
calm right now you can pre-order it look
dude don't ask me tough questions okay
you can pre-order it right now if I had
to if you do the first 50 orders we'll
get another bag for free
and every pre-order we'll get a Linus
madrenas coffee sticker okay if I had
yeah it's a good coffee we actually like
work with them to like pick the coffee
roast like it's it's it's pretty tasty
yeah yeah it's good if I had to guess
what micro roast is I would say it's
probably kind of like a pretentious way
of saying that it's a roast but like
from a small company like micro brewery
I would be my guess sure but that's
again a reason that yeah like there you
go Micro Micro roast check this out
so there's my thermal pad these things
are so frigging awesome yeah it's it's
like great they don't leave residue on
anything they're reusable they labor
yeah do you have to lean in pretty close
to me because you don't have a mind to
with those things you just take a torch
and you eat it up oh really
because they get cold that's funny well
like I just mean they shrink when they
get cold like a lot or a little bit okay
well why am I using your screwdriver
I'm sorry well it's mine but it's also
you're borrowing it so we're pretty
close to have that and do we have a I Oh
shield odd we do micros small-batch
thanks little small-batch handcrafted so
exactly what I said yep I'd be super
down for some actually I'd be super down
for just some food feed food yet the
super chest oh my god what do you want
that's a critical failure yeah I thought
we like food before the stream started
you guys hungry it's like Midnight's
yeah what yeah you don't need me it's
called a midnight snack cult okay okay
midnight snack do you know when you eat
it I'm asleep at midnight usually yeah
well maybe if you didn't live in the
middle of nowhere
wow you wouldn't have to go to bed early
like a grandpa
wow those are fighting words right there
why well it's because he that's the only
reason he has to go to bed so early
because he lives in like like a cow town
for him like our driver here my hope in
an hour like I go to his house warming
which I found out when I got there he's
already lived there a year and I wasn't
invited to the first housewarming you
think your dick so I go to so I go to
his house warming and I'm like riding
out there on my motorbike so I'm like
I'm making pretty good time here and I'm
like I'm like when does this end like
when does this highway end this is this
is horrible this is horrible
he does this every day like to work here
I just quit if I was Colton I just quit
like it sucks I mean I didn't want
announced in front of 17,000 people but
uh I see yeah man far
our man live in the middle of nowhere
just because my youngest neighbor is
like 70 years old okay leave me alone
it's a quiet area all right are we good
to just put this in yeah I think we
should probably here why don't we clear
some space and like do it kind of a
properly way instead of just like
upright like we would do oh you have to
undo the screws of course there they've
got screws retaining it which is smart
from things not breaking standpoint I
guess uh yeah yeah hit me with the food
options I really want garlic fingers you
don't have to yell you have a mic I know
but I wanted Jake to know okay so our
options are McDonald Wendy's McDonald's
D plus pizza D plus pizza is actually
pretty good ease or an W why would they
call it it's like it's like an Indian
pizza chain and I think they that might
mean something to like Indian people
that is not apparent to me but it's like
really good like they have like tandoori
pizza and stuff like it's actually good
what no I'm serious okay I don't think
it's actually a like a like an
established chain though so like the D
plus pizza on like 88 and King George or
whatever or like around there like for
that one is like that I'd I don't I
can't speak to that one I just order it
just do it Jake I have no idea yeah
okay so here's what I was kind of
thinking this goes like that oh you took
it off no well that's also a solution
that is excellent so here if I lift this
up can you scooch that over and then
we'll I don't know not to chew it over
nobody says huge Jake's
some people say dude so I'll lift this
up and if can you make room for me to we
can do panic oh I had pizza already
today though like pizza pizza to Iceland
it's midnight I do love a NW now okay to
be clear to our American viewers out
there I do not condone the consumption
of American anw it is American
McDonald's is worse terrible no no no
it's not just like maybe a little bit
worse like it is actually a completely
different thing I noticed that American
McDonald's is like no no American a and
W is they don't even have the teen
burger oh yes I know right
oh no wait they do no no they do but
it's garbage and they don't have like
the mama burger and the Papa burger and
stuff like they don't have the whole
burger family thing going on and what
was the other issue with it oh right
it's terrible just everything it was I
just couldn't believe I couldn't even
eat it I was so hungry I was on this
like I was on this trip that was like a
really fast turnaround it was super late
and I was so hungry and I was like oh
thank goodness there's an A&amp;amp;W like
basically in the parking lot of my hotel
and I was so excited to eat it and then
I took one bite of it and I was like wow
this is the worst fast food I have ever
eaten in my life
okay I was like kind of down for that
what are our other options no I also had
Chinese food today I had pizza for lunch
I had Chinese food for dinner what kind
of food I'm super down for Indian food
yeah we'll probably get like curry all
over the computer and stuff that
wouldn't be pewter oh okay I guess
that's an option but we kind of need you
here to like handle it if something goes
wrong because like lord knows Courtney's
not gonna do it yeah exactly
well no I'm not even being sarcastic
like you're an important member of the
team yeah I mean I don't even know why
Colton's here oh you have to show
chauffeur madrenas right yep hey Colton
you have a shell I can talk about the
new coffee roast
all right yeah yeah where why why are
you leaving coffees right here holding
the cold Brews too right you gotta wash
your cup
who washes a coffee cup you got to keep
the stank in there I'm kidding I
strongly do not reckon strongly do not
recommend that that's one extra screw I
took out it well when it weighed the
baby's here let's do pizza yeah all
right fine
stored or whatever I don't care I
guessed where those would go in but I
was kind of wrong Oh where which would
go in the cables how did you get it
wrong they're like in exactly the
standard places where they go I think
three pizzas is a lot of pizzas I'm
gonna have like two pieces three pieces
tops two pizzas that is still a lot of
okay you know what just I I just want
her lingers oh yeah pillows here - he's
not gonna eat pizzas no do you left okay
yeah and he's not gonna be pizza anyway
I feel good I already told you I don't
envy it says this dude yet no no but
it's Jake just ordered the pizzas yeah
I'm super down but do they have garlic
fingers that's the only thing that I
care about yeah what's the difference
ideally with donair sauce although you
guys don't have how are we gonna get
donair sauce from an Indian place well
but the thing is you need hellofax
donair sauce because that's the real
good stuff Alex you're being very
unreasonable right now well but have you
had some like high quality garlic
fingers with hellofax donair sauce
before that just really is not relevant
to the conversation we're having right
now it's almost as good as madrenas
coffee
we can't obtain that you're standing
right in the way nobody can see anything
oh just go that we were on the other cam
no we're not and also they were they
would never been able to see anything on
the other camera Oh terrible we should
probably look at some holy crap we have
a lot of super chats is that even right
no this must be this must be a lifetime
yeah this is the no yeah this is like
left
from the other one um yeah sure okay
did you just did you just drop this
eight pin yeah oh okay didn't the other
one do you want it back yeah I'm into
whichever I don't care I don't care
doesn't matter I'm gonna be able to
sleep tonight yeah that's fine
I think I will be able to sleep I mean
if you're gonna like if you're gonna
drink the coffee like you might as well
drink it over here oh yeah you just want
to have your microphone you just want to
have your time in the Sun I do all right
fine that's fine I understand that like
to talk about myself
oh so you just kind of guessed it at the
SATA and the molex requirements I don't
think we need either of those things we
don't but I thought that it would just
be nice to have you down in there for
like later I'm listening can we do super
cheesy garlic bread hey Can we order
both and can you just put them together
you're gonna be that guy it's like yeah
so I looked at the menu but like could
you just I mean I see you've got all the
ingredients for this could you just
could you just make this instead like I
looked at your menu it wasn't on there
but you know if I think I think really
any kitchen should probably have these
ingredients so yeah you're that guy you
are that guy it's like when you go in to
make a noise and you're like you know I
want them at gangbang and they're just
like what gangbang and then you're like
no yeah you should explain what that is
because that might be like a regional
thing it's it's when you take a big
double and you like open it up and then
in between the two patties you put a jr.
chicken yeah it's really good I actually
have never tried that probably said my
favorite McDonald's hack is that when
you go in like they have to do things
the way that you asked so if you go in
and you're like yeah I want to join your
chicken but like add lettuce add tomato
add like stuff that turns it into an
actual burger it only costs I think
somewhere in the neighborhood like 20 30
cents per thing you add so if you get
like the we're not even on that angle
what are you doing damn it it's not even
in focus it's the world's least
satisfying peel of all time of all time
no there's been a couple of those ones
where it like sticks and like leaves
residue and stuff those are way worse a
sticky peel it's been ordered all right
for better for better or for worse our
Indian style pizza is on route
I'm excited actually I'll tell you yeah
yeah I'm super down I'm super down Oh
what is this that's actually like one of
the reasons that I end up eating a lot
of Indian food with my family because I
have a couple vegetarians in my family
they have like with all the cheese's
they have so many options for
vegetarians like I'm not vegetarian
alright I'll eat meat all day but like
if you're if you're gonna have a
vegetarian at the table you might as
well go get Indian food because then the
meat eaters can also enjoy it too I have
not wow thank you for that you dick
alright gpus in I know right Alex what
do you think the coffee coffee's good so
what are we drinking coffee one we're
actually not drinking our coffee roast
right now we're drinking we are drinking
sidequest medium roast on the dearness
side questions for the travelers crave
adventure and journeys down unknown
paths they seek the trail to their
sponsoring a secrets of culture and
flavor
if darker roasts are coffee's main quest
line then madrenas side quest is here to
introduce the medium roasted nutty side
of coffee with a blend of our Fairtrade
organic coffee forged or forging an
unforgettable trail of cinnamon and
brown sugar e flavor they are never
sponsoring us again that's pretty good
sorry Shlomo yeah sorry slow started I'm
sorry this is
why we don't let Allison sponsor it's
okay our roast is a brilliant blend of
medium roasted Latin American and
African coffee beans
this roast showcases a sweet chocolaty
flavor a huge bold body and a smooth
caramel finish yeah that's that's it
that was almost better Colton that was
almost better I'll take it was almost
better than my Alice and that travesty
that Alex that's pretty good executed
over there that's good that's right you
executed a travesty the travesty died
it's so good I'm shaking you know it's
funny because you know it's funny like I
publicly like people leave comments I'll
be like months looks like the worst boss
in the world to work for it because he's
so mean to his staff but when we live
stream I think that's when you guys out
there you guys watching at home that's
when you guys finally get a look at the
kind of crap they put me through yeah
you just told me I have no life that is
an incredible thing to say to somebody
you just told Colton he has no life no
life
yeah Colton has a life he first he gets
up in the morning okay
Bennie drives okay then he goes to his
job where everyone hates him then he
gets back then he gets back in his car
and he drives and then he goes to sleep
like an old man hey thirty minutes so
this PC build okay keep building we
totally need a cold night it's just like
and we need we need a how like how dead
inside Colton is ohmmeter do you think
that Anthony needs audio yeah he needs
an audio it's right here sorry I never
they're gonna hear no it's like what why
are you going away it's like I was
handing it to you okay whatever it's oh
I thought that you were just doing it
cuz I'm confused where the USB is USB
you're talking about it's already
installed oh no wonder I didn't see ya
way ahead of you baby oh
worth my reset switch at right there yes
I'm having fun and I'm starting to wake
up now time sighs it's nice
time flies me having fun lots of it
there's more in the fridge so just don't
worry about it
yeah madrenas hooked us up pretty hard
for this scream mmm it's kind of like
they're streams so like it makes sense
but it still it's nice it's nice it's a
nice gesture
okay Colton now what are what are we up
to on this build there 20 exactly 30
minutes exactly 30 minutes cuz you want
to know something what we're done yeah
that's right okay Linus and Alex team
work makes Colton's dream die his dream
of us not completing this build thank
you Alex
in the amount of time that Colton
thought that we would do it like we're
done right like we suspect this cable
management dude out on but like we don't
have to cuz it's not even a glass side
panel on this version in this case every
minute so why don't we why don't we put
let's put all the case accessories in in
things here I don't know like a little
bit better no let's get let's let's
start getting them done cuz thread
Ripper is like a massive CPU and takes a
little longer to install and stuff you
know yeah so yes I don't want to get
cocky I've had this problem before where
like I make some kind of a bet in like
scrapyard Wars or something and I'm like
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna beat that mark
by so much you're gonna just gonna make
your head spin and then I end up losing
but I like the margin that I gave up so
I'm tired of that I've had enough all
right so we can throw this windowed side
panel back on yep and that my friends is
how you build a comb poot or should we
see if it works I don't even think the
food's gonna get here by the time we're
gonna be done building all three of
these yeah that's right Colton that's
fine we could just do like an eating
stream after that's really popular like
over in Asia I think like eating
channels usually I think it's like
attractive young women though so I think
this will not quite capture I'm having
trouble getting this on I'm having
trouble getting this on - do we have
that we have the opposite side side
difference I don't know well here let's
just try it okay let's just hear a
tempered glass and off like that what
could go wrong
nothing clearly I got it take your in I
missed twice hold on hold on I'll get it
in I'll get it in here I'm gonna get it
will you though yeah I will
well how can I don't line this up it's
like there lordy
okay I'll these are magnetic cool yeah
you know what let's let's do it let's
verify it looks at least verify that it
posts I think that's uh that's fair to
Colton okay do you want to verify it and
I'll start getting the other crap over
here sure do you want to get the crap
from this one away from here yes instead
okay let me just throw this monitor like
kind of here it's dropping my toolkit
which is a bad time but it should be
okay so don't worry about it Jake just
chill just chill just chill just chill
just
Oh Jake just chill just tell just chill
just chill it's all good it's all good
okay
suck it you want a pizza review yeah I'm
down okay cool yeah I'm super into it
what is it oh
oh we forgot about the 10 gig oh right
yes we need 10 gigglin o get rekt widest
you know what we're still at like 32
minutes or whatever so yeah it's not
hard to put why don't you get yeah so
this is this is our 10 gig network card
Thank You Jake
you got this you got this Oh beautiful
look at that 10 gig gorgeous I write 10
gigabit per second Network gorgeous so
right I guess now is a good time to
shout out everyone who sent us Hardware
for this stream Intel AMD like kind of
not intentionally but like we just have
all this thread Ripper stuff lying
around we have like a lot of thread
Ripper stuff
Asus mad mad props trace and Corsair
sending over these like these are
pretty ballin workstations all oh yeah
there's no way to lose when we were
deciding who gets like the good one
everyone gets a good one yeah that
caught yeah your builds gonna be like
straight-up aesthetics rather than like
practical 8700 K is like peasant
compared to yeah that's true no I can
they even hear you right now no we have
Colton I'm here now no no I got it I got
it I got it I got it no one wants to
hear Colton read the super chat Oh read
a super Jack Colton do it called me the
super chat I actually legitimately don't
know how okay I'll do the super yeah I
just try to turn them down turn it down
what there's 20,000 people watching Oh
what time what time is it where were
frozen of you like go tell three friends
to watch like guys where are you from
that you can watch this stream right now
well that's true actually yeah or
they're from Australia like we have a
disproportionate number of viewers from
Australia because for so long we've
released our videos at midnight Pacific
time because that was like the that was
the point in the day where I could
finally get around to posting a video
India really so we are gonna be straight
up eating the Indian style pizza for our
viewers from India hey okay are they are
they in Surrey
I'm serious you can get very authentic
Indian food
in Surrey like this is look we had a
huge Indian community in Surrey and it's
like it's awesome because here's the
thing in Vancouver you can get good in
food but be prepared to pay a lot of
money for it because it's like upscale
in Surrey you can get very authentic
Indian food cheap because there's a huge
Indian community there it's like awesome
and like it's cheap it's great it's a
good thing all right we're ready
can i fire this baby up did it power on
yeah cool well it does RGB it doesn't
have a lot of RGB so it's like hard to
tell that's hopefully fine turn back on
oh oh you just hit it while it was doing
the thing oh did I yeah oops okay sorry
zero zero which I guess is fine no
that's that's good oh it's it's doing
stuff now I might have gotten a little
cocky but why is this back fan not
spinning did you not hook it up oh well
that's what I was that's what I was
looking at I was looking at the back fan
Alex dude new CPU installed did you hook
it up I did yeah
well it's clearly not very well yeah
yeah I did it wrong that's kind of
impressive how I did that actually did
you know it works
did you break our fan no I didn't hurt
me you just break out thinnies cooling
fan no Anthony's gonna be fine you're a
monster some 16 gigs of RAM yes I 999
hundred K so beautiful we are the way so
they can share the experience with us
Colton oh we are one system down only
two to go by the way nice you're almost
40 minutes yeah so we want to do some
math how long do we have to do this you
give 100 you have two hours
uh-huh which is how many minutes just
let me do them up here hundred twenty
bro 120 can you stop stalling for time
right now so 120 divided by 40 is what
three and how many systems we say we're
gonna go mmm three love it oh good luck
yes okay let's not get into that let's
not break this thing down yeah I don't
know I don't know
well well you know we'll cross that
bridge when we get to it we'll cross
that bridge when we get to it oh all
right I've got to put this monitor here
or something okay so let's get all the
boxes and everything together
oh yeah that's like - yeah broken the
monitor no no it's fine it's fine it's
all good it's just great this stream
okay so is this is this this yep
this all goes here okay ladies and
gentlemen can they build two more
systems within the next 80 minutes yeah
can you immune coltan stay tuned shakes
like way ahead of you it's like way like
oh okay
I hear can you bring that a little bit
further over let's just let's get some
distance between us and the finish
system so all right now spread them out
thank you Alex
all right cool now let's do something
let's do some thread ripping let's rip
some threads baby oh we got the fancy
graphics card on this one too so I guess
let's do what exists Ivan system I'm
sure this will ends who's got the fancy
graphics card this time was that a was
that a Strix over there oh no was yeah
oh who gets the the rear exhaust one
then I guess I James does yeah James
James is kinda he's like practical he
would like a quieter overall system
experience rather than a card that
turbos a little bit higher at the
expense of the temps of the rest of your
system so we're gonna we're gonna make
this Ivan's why am i taking the graphics
card out right now I'm getting ahead of
myself a little bit here way too much
fun we should do this every night
yeah system system stream every night
I'll never sleep again everybody will
have madrenas - - when you started Linus
tech tips did you ever think you'd have
your own coffee road uh when I started
Linus tech tips the last thing on my
mind was whether or not I would ever
have my own coffee roast I was trying to
figure out
to afford beverages like we were we were
out of money like straight up out of
money before before the first checks
started rolling in like it was really
tight so yeah no no I did not I did not
never dream of this so wow this
motherboard I don't need any of these
amazing accessories because the i/o
shield is built-in so once again I'm
just no this is actually a 10 gig
network card that's included yeah we
should just keep the other ones for the
other workstations because I don't think
I do or Alex are you okay you have ten
gig what part are you using you know I
think it's from the Maximus ten oh so
you just stole one from a motherboard
did you at least notate it correctly in
the system all right we actually
probably should do that but the thing is
that the newer ones like the ones they
just shipped us have a newer chipset
from the pancha so it's probably better
to use the more mature chipset cause
Alex oh yeah I forgot this i forgot
about this every time linus dropped
something on stream we're supposed to
take a swig oh hey you already dropped
something so okay if he drops something
bagel shotgun sure sure
yeah thank you no it'll be bad time for
the rest of us though cuz don't you get
the farts yeah right it's a good thing
we're gonna be done these systems by the
time yeah cuz that's not gonna be good
no get out of here I know actually I
need get get out get out of here okay
nineteen fifty X gorgeous that green
thing is oh oh this isn't supposed to be
here well it's here now
that's okay funny I'll deal with that
later
ah why not yeah throw drippers really
bad for not posting yo just cuz like
it's hard to get the CPA lined up
correctly these like it's a torch so I
can look I'm a share secret their
instructions are very poor you shouldn't
just like go one two three when you
close it you should go one two three a
tiny bit and then go one two three a
tiny bit more and then torque it down
because that's how you push the CPU in
evenly otherwise I have also had issues
with thread Ripper or not not posting
until your recent CPU and also it gets
mad at some types of RAM so I don't know
how much it likes benjin's pro but we'll
find out why would I try that why would
I try that but I can just like be that
boss who's like hey Jake can you just
fix my cars you know
yeah that's true but that backpack car
though no we've got a plan for the car
oh there's a plan anything right now
there's a plan for the car I think I
already leaked it or you delete it
yeah I think I already said what the
plan is oh you're probably running over
the it's gonna bomb the tank oh yeah
yeah we're gonna run over the Lambo with
the tank probably gonna involve a tank I
actually don't object to taking the
engine out first and building a go-kart
around it I don't necessarily alex is
down cap not promising anything right
now that would be a really fun go-kart
we need to okay Adam our excellent plan
from before that's kind of dead now it
would be really great for that as they
say on like super corporate conference
calls I think we need to take this
discussion offline
except like unlike conference calls we
are actually literally online not just
talking to some people in suits there's
probably some people wearing suits dang
it
I need thermal compound this dye is too
big like it is just too big
look at it we don't even need to switch
to the close-up camera look how big this
CPU is you don't even have to look it's
gigantic it's ridiculous so I've got my
sorry I've got my graphite thermal pad
here and it's like lol there's the pad
CPU no you need like four and you need
to cut them up oh the big two big one
well I'm just gonna go get some paste
I'm gonna get some paste because I give
up alright so putting in the power
supply now yeah that's pretty good
no what does take is that's why I was
going and I said good you know at this
point I wouldn't even care get yourself
a mic and he could just keep her you
know super Chad Steele hold on where's
my where's my gamers Nexus mod Matt how
do I apply this thermal compound um how
many pins do we have for this one -
eight - all right now - eight pins eight
pins of what oh oh oh yeah - eight pins
- eight pins on this board alright get
that thread ripper going okay where's my
mounting hardware for this how the hell
does this thing now
I actually don't know I haven't done one
of these in a while does this have all
the mounting hardware in it hold on hold
on hold on no no I can figure this out I
know I can figure this out is that
better mic-check
is coming over here yeah yeah yeah read
some super chats what I'm a bit sketched
out by that
yeah yeah yeah this just goes on here
and then yeah I got this I got this oh
good it's all good delay in the stream
yes that's how strings work can you not
be rude to the people who super chat
escape like straight up can YouTube can
you not be rude to our valued viewers
who are all valued regardless of whether
they send super chats Jake
geez just like straight up being rude to
the viewers yeah I'm terrible I'm sorry
in fairness it wasn't a particularly
great question and Jake's rude over and
Jake is rude to absolutely everyone fire
:
yeah Oh Fredrik bring the host are we
gonna butcher people's names I'm in a
tracksuit
nice pitch I have no judgment I should
probably read this before I read it now
I just read it out what's the worst I
have no judgment my daughter decided to
wake up at 4:00 a.m. and I'm watching
you guys build a PC rather than you know
doing anything productive sounds like
you're doing something very productive
yeah that sounds pretty productive
linear doing great thing I mean if I
didn't think that that was productive
what am I doing here what are we all
doing here yeah what are we all doing 27
here but you guys look more awake to me
because caffeine the crazy stupid thing
about like this stream for me today is
that I was already here today like I was
I was here for like four or five hours
yeah you were almost viewer here doing
nothing like five minutes you were so
unhelpful it was incredible
so I was here installing like electrical
wiring and network wiring for what is
gonna be the greatest hey can you be
quiet for a sec the greatest lounge of
all time is this a good volume mic check
yeah Colton's a but yeah but he's not a
but hey when's their pizza getting here
10 minutes a pretty soon they said 12:40
hopefully pretty soon I'm super down for
some pizza actually I'm getting hungry
the longer I stay here and build
computers yeah I could absolutely
destroy some garlic fangs right now oh I
did your your I didn't get some super
cheesy I got the regular girl what are
like fangs
is that bang gee thanks no no I have no
idea what you're talking about this is
like an East Coast thing I don't know
East Coast thing or just like something
that my friends would say yeah so that's
exactly why we have this
disproportionate representation is
anyone actually wearing like a real suit
like a like a suti suit yeah cuz we're
not gonna believe you unless you post
yeah you need to tweet us a photo at
yeah and there needs to be like a clock
do I say that Linus tech yeah tweet us a
photo
Sanji really come on yeah this guy's
super chatted just to say fire colton
fire Colma better than a live stream
look look look we'll try this again hi
guys great to see you scream when I was
wondering if you ever had a raspberry
coffee and where is Linus his dragon I
saw lucky actually over the dragons name
is lucky where land center with lizard
was gonna be and I was like oh I should
really move this over and then I looked
at all the cables on the ground I was
like I know I shouldn't yeah yeah land
center is gonna be freaking awesome
I make that's an advertisement I make
CPU key chains that is what he makes CPU
key chains I'm not saying where you get
them but maybe you find them on eBay or
something hey Linus I really enjoyed the
10 year LTTE stream me too yeah there's
a lot of fun does a birthday suit count
what is that it that's okay let's go
next one do you not know what a birthday
suit is this super chat was pre-recorded
I was transaxle Jake do you not know
what a birthday sounds at Jake tie me if
you're in your birthday suit no it's a
jack oh yeah please do not do that
that's right yes super chat was
pre-recorded and the transaction was
finalized October 24th is master X 1000
it's like contributing to his own or her
own conspiracy theory it seems very you
ish very me ish North van dude also will
you do a meet-up I also just finished a
PC that's three hundred and thirty and
runs games a hundred plus fps that is
very impressive my friends does it play
battlefield five r-tx I think I think
Jake's inviting you to shill for LTX
yeah that's kind of why I was no no he
was just talking so I don't really think
it was good to talk over
whoa whoa anyways we are doing lcx and
l.jackson 2019 is going to actually be
in vancouver this year that's next to
your Tecla this is 2019 that 2019 so
it's in july and i actually don't
remember the exact I don't actually
remember the date yeah we do pretty
don't talk more about it on wage okay so
one of the reasons we're doing it on the
date we're doing it I've got some sort
of some this is a this okay so this is
the closest Colton has ever gotten to
being fired actually so LTX was supposed
to be on a particular couple of dates
and then what happened was I got pretty
much the best news of my adult life I
found out that the Backstreet Boys are
doing a reunion tour and they are coming
to Vancouver one show and I was like I
was like Vaughn Vaughn is what I call my
wife not VA ughn
it's V oh and any its with the
apostrophe at the beginning Vaughn it
would be pretty cool if we could get
tickets to the Backstreet Boys concert
and she's like she's like I'll totally
get you tickets and I'm like yeah the
problem is that like every time I make
plans it's like six months from now
every time I make plans this far in
advance
Colton comes along and screws me because
like a week before he's gonna be like
yeah
we've got this thing you're flying
you're flying to Indonesia three days
come on and pack your bags pack your
bags get out of here and she's like no
no it'll be fine it'll be fine
so get and she's like look like you know
we work we work hard if it's like a
sponsored thing or something just say no
go to the concert
enjoy yourself and like you know what
yeah I'm gonna do that then get this
okay there's so many super four days
later okay like four days later I hear
back LTX has been moved it's the same
day as the Backstreet Boys concert
well I can't bail on my own damn party
can i way to go Colton and there's
nothing that can be done about it
because it's big it's sort of because of
our partner for the event that isn't a
hundred percent locked they're just not
announcing it okay we're not it's gonna
be sick though but it's gonna be sick we
want to do it with this partner there's
no way around it so we found a
compromise I am leaving LTX early on one
of the days and I am going to my
Backstreet Boys concert come hell or
high water there you go get that
copyright strike get that copyright
break yo the one really cool thing about
LTX next year's we're doing a two day
event yeah I know that's the point
there's no room I'm not do we want a
cramp let's get high Colton here hey
what's up guys yeah
you made two day events give me great Oh
are we announcing that yeah oh okay yeah
it's gonna be booked it there you go
it's booked okay can we read them how
much is that how much is that venue for
two cuz we're gonna be the Vancouver
Convention Center help me so like we are
gonna be let me let me break it down for
you I got a van
even if LTX doesn't happen as far as I
know that venue is not refundable so
we're gonna like even if there's no load
like no convention we're just gonna be
sitting there in the Vancouver
Convention Center in like three gigantic
ballrooms
just like behind a table like signing
things or something like we're gonna be
there how much are you paying that's
actually that's actually not a bad idea
that she brought a fallback plan the
goal is we're going all-in we're going
all-in on this next year and yeah if
something falls through maybe we'll just
do that we'll set that one table and
just like 20 of us or however many of us
work yeah ofc fifty-eight of us or
whatever yes so so how much did the
venue
we don't know exactly let me give you a
reference here there is a penthouse
suite right next to that Convention
Center that's like 25 million dollars
okay well yeah it's not 25 million but
we're not buying think about that that's
the kind of property we're talking about
here is this
I don't think so okay yeah I was but it
seemed I think it's just the 24-pin
because it feels like we're like getting
fired stopped by something here like
that's not going all the way down into
the standoff so this is kind of an EI TX
ish board and this is not an EI TX ish
case and there's just there's something
there's something under it Alex no no
it'll be fun oh you know what it is it's
the backplate
yeah it's about Cleveland my board you
know what it's fine though cuz it's in
enough now that I know that it's not
interfering with something that's gonna
like short out or whatever I don't even
care so we can go ahead and do that
motherboard you've got some screws yeah
the super transfers oh my gosh we're so
far behind
um okay that one's not going in which
one's not going in the one furthest over
here ah here's a good one okay I think
that's fine we'll get all the other ones
in okay so Christian asks what's the
latest update on the six editors one CPU
actually I can answer this kena how much
can you just tell them what's up okay um
so there is a slight issue with the
motherboard actually um it might be
software pixel might be Hardware fixable
but doesn't stands right now
the motherboard just actually can't
support that many graphics cards so I'm
just glad it wasn't user error yeah I
was pretty sure it was user error but it
actually turned out that Linus doesn't
suck well let's not get ahead of
ourselves parsley so we're waiting on
yeah I got the bottom one in so if
you've got that one in then we're good
hope we already read that one yeah let's
not let's not flex it yeah that's what I
was yeah so we'll just still we'll do a
six screw approach not because we
couldn't have done nine screws
given the time boom just because the
safety of the motherboard we're not
gonna flex it we're just gonna let the
backplate rest on the
that thing and it's a no-fly zone yeah
oh yeah
can you explain that to me because I
don't I don't keep up with I look down
and just says give Colton the raise
that's not why did you send that super
Chinese James that was a waste of $5.00
day yeah I bounced back the man in my
head says it was great to see you guys
can grab some the ten-year anniversary
no I think no one got sick because of me
is for did we do we not but I didn't put
the end out to and yet I'm sorry I'm dr.
Hyde no it's fine I can do it properly
less than six hours in time to be at
work so of course let's do this thing
also I'm watching the Galaxy Note 3 7
didn't you have one of those yeah no no
I didn't was gonna order but uh you are
like the worst super chat radio you can
what yeah you just what are you doing
what's going to order $80 a madrenas to
us really using code - so it'd just be
$40 but shipping turn out to be 85 US
dollars well so that is something
madrenas is working on but live in
Australia what were you except do you
know how far away Australia is very far
so I recently took a nonstop flight to
Incheon Airport that's in South Korea
which is not nearly as far away as
Australia do you know how long that
flight was that flight was 12 hours 12
hours how was that that was a non-stop
it was terrible did you girls wish ah no
I actually I'm done breath of the wild
like I have no use for my switch anymore
I should just sell it like breath of the
wild was amazing if I'm being if I'm
being honest with myself because it's
really hard to kind of it's kind of hard
to change your answer to a question like
what is your favorite game of all time
because my answer has always been Final
Fantasy 6 and I really didn't think it
was ever gonna change Final Fantasy 6 is
a fantastic game it is far better than
the sum of its parts
the music is amazing the characters are
amazing the story is amazing for a Final
Fantasy game like it's pretty
it's pretty shallow if we're being
honest but at least there's like you
know a plot twist that you kind of don't
see coming ish like it's a great game
I think breath of the wild is my
all-time favorite game wow that's crazy
yeah yeah it's really really good
you should try and it's not gonna live
up to that but you try a Mario Odyssey
if you're into like 3d Mario games the
Odyssey is good I so okay I skipped a
lot of generations of gaming so when I
was really young my friend had an S so I
played like a fair bit of the original
Mario Brothers then I got ass Ness so he
started coming over to my house right
and so I played the crap at a Super
Mario World
I completely skipped n64 oh wow
PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 so I moved
in with my mom who is bless her heart
lots of other redeeming qualities not
real supportive of gaming No so I didn't
have a game console until around the
time I moved out and one of my buddies
like gave me his old ps2 not prop to
Tyson anyway so so you just skip that so
I just never owned a game console until
the week like a modern one from Super
Nintendo to week now I had a PC yeah but
not like a gaming PC so I play games
like sieve 2 or whatever like I was able
to play video games but not right not
like hardcore so I got my PC so I built
my first gaming PC when I was I think 17
and then the we came out like a couple
years later so I didn't actually have
like a legit gaming PC or a console for
like I don't know six years or seven
years or whatever they just yeah Wow
okay yeah I take back my recommendation
it's a really good game but Christ all
chap lays into a big part of it I have
tried to play Mario 64 yep like I've
tried a couple times I even bought it
for the Wii Virtual Console yeah so I
paid like $13 or whatever whatever it
cost me and I was sorry I paid $13 for
it cuz I just like didn't get it wait
wait where's I
what's a Mario pushes thing what you
mean he doesn't jump and like how do you
jump on stuff like this it's it's in
three dimensions
I don't even control this bunny that's
great hey I need your wallet and like I
don't even mind how terrible graphics
are I got you a thing you got me a thing
that's not my favorite
sriracha Bacon's pretty good it's not my
favorite though maple maple bacon maple
bacon so the sponsor the stream is
madrenas and we have our own roast
that's right my friends you can order
the what's it what are we calling it
Lambeau are we gonna get my a roast no
we're not gonna get in trouble for you
can pre-order it right now okay 50% off
on madrenas not just on the Lambeau row
so you can just buy other stuff that you
know is good already
but the Lambeau roast we actually it's
not just like one person like we
validated it internally had a lot of
people try it out and people pretty much
agrees that doesn't like it
I think Boyd but Lloyd's kind of like a
coffee snob no offense the Lloyd like
that one
the the one that we didn't get oh okay
okay well hey there you go yeah I mean
boy does a Mac exactly so like all you
need yeah I mean we're really trusting
his taste like honestly like I'm not I'm
not trying to be rude or anything but
you guys that's PC I'm just being honest
but we're not quite done I still have to
hook up the front buttons and stuff all
right
you don't really get it Colton like
we're not we're not gonna slow down as
the night goes on we're just getting our
momentum going like we're we are PC
building machines like just building a
normal PC two guys who have built like
the desk of PCs and like epic sleeper
rigs like this is nothing I could do
this in my sleep
hey okay and I don't need to sleep
because this whole stream is powered by
caffeine it's like the legal astruc ever
all right I just got to hooked up these
uh front buttons and LEDs and we're like
ready to post this thing right yep I'm
going to connect yeah the case fan
correctly this time yeah that would be
good thank you for that it's not your
pretty hard to reach this board is
actually like super dirty like what did
we use this for I don't remember ever
deploying any like long term thread
repair machines yet the one that we did
the chiller on no I don't think so it's
like dusty okay I need to get like some
pliers to get in there okay cool
see we're like fetching tools Colton
we're still gonna slay this wait he
needs pliers to plug in a fan header
okay I had far too much respect for Alex
I think far too much
oof why does he need pliers where is
even trying to plug this in oh my god he
needed pliers for this and we drank all
the coffee friends didn't you put a
bunch in the fridge like wasn't that
okay let's crack open another wait Jake
do charge on this yeah you're weak Alex
you're weak
of course it's in all right good job
hey we got pizza
we got weight as Kat ago I thought you
ordered like Indians not like Indian
what what since when if I I mean to be
clear I'm not like anti pantego or
anything it's just that I had 10 ago
like six hours ago that's the only
problem here we're no longer than that I
guess all right today you don't have a
mic like your it was like you were one
no I'm good thank you
you are gonna get the farty so bad
there's like so much cheese on this all
right so we got our power our plug Doon
yeah heck yeah do it hey cold when you
ready for two for two all right
heat level hot I'm going to not have fun
with that just ignore that we got a lot
of super chance and we started to
answering them and now there's like
how's that postcode going there there
buddy it's saying detect memory which I
was concerned about yeah I almost a
chance that was gonna happen
so of course err I didn't know that we
were doing thread Ripper systems because
we weren't supposed to be doing thread
Ripper systems because Asus was gonna
send more Zee 390 boys so alex is gonna
go get some thread Ripper compatible
memory okay yeah Fred Ripper does not
always look post with look whatever you
put in it
maybe just try receiving them but I
installed them correctly
what's the post code um it could be the
CPU ad memory hmm yeah which still could
be the CPU that's true tell you what
I'll try different slots all right I'm
gonna try deewaar I see one go ahead
however sometimes when you don't seat
CPU correctly or fully we can have
certain DIMM slots not work because
they're not making proper contact like
there's a connection between the bottom
pads of the CPU and the memory slot so
my hands are greasy now for pizza
they're bad so that is like a
motherboard that doesn't have bent pins
right because we do have one of those
zenith extremes that has some bent pins
on them you serious yeah well I didn't
think to check that well like in the
system it would just say it oh well I
can tell you the
I can tell you which one it is it's uh
be 34:19 be thirty four nine yeah if you
want to double-check that that would be
that would be super cool thanks Alex
meantime I will move these memory slots
are these memory modules over one thing
that's really nice on the intel high-end
boards now is that it's like a stupid
aesthetic thing but they put the memory
slots one way on the one side and then
the same way on the other side instead
of upside down on one side and the right
way on the other side so like if you
have RGB effects or whatever they're
they all run the same direction I mean
you can reconfigure them on a lot of the
RGB memory now but just saying 5:18 a.m.
and Newfoundland and Here I am watching
you guys hashtag priorities hi from giro
heck yeah hello yeah is this a bad one I
don't know the keyboard isn't working on
the inventory PC so okay gotta love it
gonna love it yeah I'm kind of ready for
pizza yeah
I just I really want to see this thing
16 gigs ram ah so we can you know what
that counts we can we can figure out the
the little details later all right
yes a pizza very nice alright alright
what else we got here for soup chats
finally watch - yeah what you guys do at
a pizza how is that pizza yeah okay hold
on huh he needs another couple bites
it's not spicy but it has a spices kind
of smells it's aromatic of the onion not
that pepper good okay so what is this
this is called the chipotle chicken
while there's a monitor in place this is
the chipotle chicken pizza it's got
chicken and corn and green peppers and
onion on it and instead of pizza sauce
its chipotle sauce it's like most
importantly how well does it go with an
ice-cold madrenas
so guys check out time we've got the
madrenas Lambo roast we're gonna have
that linked somewhere cold you want to
throw that in the chat or whatever yeah

should try out the custom roast because
we gotta kick back on it right yeah yeah
cool because we gotta kick back on it
and it's good so I actually haven't
tried it yet we had how many people did
we have tested internally I think we
have like 10 yeah 10 or 12 Jake I don't
even rank Oh coffee

without me oh my gosh
all right I don't like to coffee but I
like this madrina stuff so so is this
system and gonna we good yeah hey cool
what time is it you guys have 30 minutes
38 minutes or into the superjet oh
you're slacking you're at an hour and 12
so you actually have like 48 minutes oh
cool do we have the 10 gig card in this
one thank you love it so you have eight
minutes to finish this one with the
pizza in your hand do we get an
extension for the pizza so we get a
5-minute extension for not yet no okay
all right well I gotta put this in if
you don't finish in time you know here
first
one-handed pen got rooked art
installation get that pineapple it's
good it's good stuff not wrong to put
pineapple on pizza or pizza mm-hmm
that's funny cuz i'm like a proponent
for not having sign apple on pizzas yeah
well then I guess you just didn't
realize how great it was
it's good to know I don't like Hawaiian
though this is a good comparison
Hawaiian is okay you can't just say
Hawaiian pizza sucks so you shouldn't
put pineapple on pizza I agree yeah
didn't put pineapple on pizza no no
that's not that's not what I'm saying
just because one particular type is like
so played out doesn't mean that it's a
bad thing overall it's a bad thing
pump it up you know we've drop hold it
before what I don't care what they think
anyway because pineapple on pizza is
just fine okay
one-handed find out blue is delicious
all right terrible is prime you kiss
your mother with that mouth with a
pineapple no and no I don't like what
nibbling make out with my mother like
what are you what are you wrong with you
people who don't eat pineapple on your
pizzas you're injured you're sick you're
sick so the internet there you go
one-handed 10-gig installation want to
hit me up with that that there panel
thanks Alex Oh hold on boys I got it
oriented the wrong way here oh that was
scary tempered glass baby oh oh okay
conspiracy confirmed the dropping stuff
is just an act
no no I knew there was a chance I'd drop
it I can't fail if I drop it you guys
are gonna freak out and it's gonna be
awesome and if I don't drop it you guys
freak out this awesome say I can't lose
weight did we put the screws in for the
graphics card
oh we did what are these extra thumb
screws for oh the tummy in the back who
doesn't eat their tummy in the back
oh yeah you know I always see my costume
it's like the best part of the pizza I
didn't eat the crust I know I do eat the
crust although I was in a hurry and I
wanted to eat more somebody's asking
where's Dennis Dennis is probably
sleeping yeah it's like 1:00 a.m. here
there is an old man too
we're gonna move your butt Linus yeah
bought some of the LTT coffee but honey
use someone else's coupon code I mean
honestly if you'd if you got 50% off
than power to you man what a monster
next Michael Dennis Coulter you inspired
me to make a 5150 sleeper bill just
waiting on the parts now nice
so I screwed up one thing we were gonna
put in that NIC that was included with
the motherboard we did not I put in the
fresh one but I guess it doesn't really
matter
Christopher Wagner just spent fifty one
dollars and 26 cents after offer Kota
madrenas and ordered euro second okay
hold on Alex we're scattering that's it
so this over there is the one for that
mm-hmm I'm done chillin this motherboard
box this is the one for the one we just
built yes also no you just put these
systems like right next to each other no
no the idea okay hold on
we keep track of which stuff went into
which system so that the inventory
system doesn't get all screwed up okay
this is what how these things happen
just keep them separate okay we good
also a bit cooler yeah cool thank you
now you're not way to go Jake like
straight up completely like pointing
that camera at me it's okay I'm not done
over there yet I don't think I gotta
take something else over there oh wait
no I don't know it's already did it so
Jake was trying to get me organizing the
systems here so that all the boxes for
all the same systems are all together in
Stefan you should be a camera person no
you're far more valuable as the young
person who advises us on what's like hip
and cool with the kids like straight up
we should just put that on Jake's
business card twitter twitter like this
is why you're a bad camera person you
still have it over there you're like not
producing the show at all here let me
just fix this for you today you drinking
madrina
nope I'm not eating I do the case this
time okay all right why don't we why
don't we show so Colton that we're not
only faster at building pcs than him
we're also versatile like I can do the
case in power supply you can do the
motherboard and RAM and we're still
gonna finish this system well within the
time
our teamwork will slay you you don't
have a microphone over there anymore
Colton hashtag no microphone it's over
here I actually was kind of happy to be
the one doing all the like not heavy
lifting stuff so this kind of sucks
yeah no I'm not so much of a lift II boy
are we just inspecting the socket yeah
yeah that's a good idea yeah let me
punch it on this every motherboard
manufacturer on the planet will swear up
and down that it is impossible that you
could get a bent pin right out of the
box
I have personally had it happen more
than once
with multiple motherboard brands that
was fun
and it also set on fire what pizzas
terrible you're not miked Colton you're
not Mike don't
which one's the one I had before what
kind of monster leaves a pizza box open
when no one's taking pizza out of it you
guys I know but you were gone you left
and you keep your keep them stacked you
keep them stacked you keep the heat in
wait can we just put it behind a
computer or something
no I'll help we've tried warming pizza
before that was a bad scene was a great
video I'm talking about yeah no you know
that was there were lots of problems let
me read some super shots were really
behind $10 so Alex can buy a new sweater
get a new sweatshirt and get rid of
those pit stains Wow Oh
hold on hold on who's the savage Van
Daan Wow
dang well I just got hurt ouches got
rekt yeah
did we read this one roast it then our
roast I'm building PCs for people that
lost theirs in the camp fire here in
California for free oh that's cool for
you Ryan you're a cool guy
did you say camp fire cuz I'm sure he
meant like no that's what I called that
forest fire no in California was called
camp fire
Oh in California sorry sound word ah
it's like kind of a sick joke sorry okay
anyways
Zachary Berger says where's Dennis but I
think we already read that one so okay
alright alright if you're just gonna
read the same super chats over and over
again you start too hard to keep track
alright do you mind switching to the oh
yeah oh one of I am on top of it so I'm
adding another level of challenge to my
side of the bill over here I'm gonna do
the whole thing one-handed and I'm still
gonna beat Colton's
stupid benchmark here no problem no
issue mm-hmm somebody asked about the
folding giveaway I'm going to announce
the ten seventy winners on Monday we
already announced the 1080 winner yep so
if you didn't hear about it already and
you were hoping for the 1080 I think
you're done how many cards did we give
away three it's cool but a guy that won
the 1080 was like a longtime folder oh
yeah helping with the contest which is
really cool
oh that's really cool what you didn't
like rig it did you no oh good okay we
used a random number generator between
Wow oh I dropped like one in a hundred
oh I dropped my pizza no choice was a
sport game on the floor bend quickly I
had probably said that wrong I believe
in the five-second rule even though
there's actually no scientific basis for
that no a man six seconds and you're
you're done you got to give up at that
point no I think I was reading an
article it's like wrong oh I'm sure it
is how to protect yeah there's no why is
this yep
mmm okay pour water no that's all right
you saw pizza in the other
no no I'm just doing it one-handed
because I can now oh okay I'm good I got
this yeah
have you dropped something yet like you
mean shotgun I'm Audrina I don't think
so
you almost you should drop the computer
that would have been funny
no that would have been actually really
I'm going on Alex because Alex like the
screw work okay I almost dropped my
screwdriver but then I didn't nobody's
looking at you looking at Alex's
excellent screw work screw work yeah
Alex you keep screwing Alex you screw
like a champ let's drop your screw their
driver you know I know your girlfriend I
could verify this well so Alex informed
me that he gets told this can you can
you back that up or contradict that
claim should be like this is the
weirdest thing ever my my my
my boyfriend's boss is that what what
look just just don't worry about it
YouTube YouTube chat wanted to know okay
YouTube chat wanted to know they sent us
you know seven dollars and we figured
while at that point there's a
contractual obligation to ask this
question so it's like literally but
super chat is like the ultimate the
ultimate low low slow like small-scale
whoring right because it's like you'll
do whatever they say for like three
dollars or whatever I think the minimum
is five for to like show up five for it

of workstations we we aren't we are
literally like drowning in workstations
right that's it unloaded or my sipping
unsubbed for Jake's Thank You Jake

worst person ever I forget the name of
the other guy he was super nice he's
pretty cool anyway they built custom
rigs for us and like invited us down to
LA I think for like kind of a shoot
where we talked about our ideal systems
and then they like kind of probed people
we knew for the answers ahead of time
and then basically presented us with
these ideal systems it was pretty cool
queen bee says love ltte Purple Heart
thanks queen bee hold on hold on
I got it I got to adjust my grip on this

this a madrenas coffee giveaway stream
what the heck do you do with your oldest
older stuff what do we do with our older
stuff giveaway
yeah I think he's talking about hardware
Oh hardware a lot of the time we build
like internal work stations and stuff
with it sometimes yeah sometimes yeah
sometimes Dennis takes it home without
asking yeah it really varies to be
honest with you
okay I need mike says fire colton then
I'll send you my wife dang Nocturnals
ask him what do you guys say is the key
to speed building every time I build a
gaming machine it takes at least an hour
thanks from the best videos I mean
there's two of them so that's yeah
buying new hardware get all the practice
there ah cryptic slave keep sippin no do
not keep sipping the only one who can
set your boy is sippy P that is such an
old and like niche
reference now it is I just don't even
think well hold on I I do talk about it
in my your gigantic twitch chat I get

stream please keep slurping and just do
whatever Linus doesn't want you to do
also Alex is much cuter than Linus don't
have to bring it up oh yeah Alex's
girlfriend like what righty
why are you gonna be like that Linus
dropped a cable apparently what cable
did you drop a cable oh I mean maybe
probability says that doesn't count
though yeah I don't know if that's
really a drop that's just like okay are
you ready for me is that why you're
standing there yeah
do you have the m dot to in this guy
says by big oh yeah trap says subject
all right hold on okay how much time do
i have to finish this one-handed cable
management here
thirty minutes oh yeah it should be fine
hashtags show up now it's probably okay
no way this is gonna be the one that
posts so much faster than the other two
it's gonna make your head spin MAPE
corrected you apparently was a hundred
and seventy dollars one hundred and
seventy five dollars this time
sorry mate so now it's one hundred and
seventy seven dollars me when's that
sweet new merch dropping I need
something other than super chair money
when are we launching the new merch
store Colton do you have any idea what's
going on with that no idea no idea
alright cool there's your answer we have
no idea
we have no idea do your best
longest sip ever okay ah that's my bread
you know what we should show though we
should show the new LTTE zip ties are
not a zip tie Zach cable ties do you
know where they are
I'll go find them yeah there's no
there's some just on the office supply
shelf yeah yeah can you grab some some
guys asking if I wanna take your shirt
off for 20 melons stream i I mean I take
my shirt off for nothing I take my shirt
off all the time on tech linked maybe
you have a problem it is possible well
Dennis doesn't all the time - and Dennis
just does it cuz he's like smoking hot
you know I do it cuz like maybe I aspire
to be smoking hot where's the a pin on
this guy oh is that why you were moving
things around last time yeah what do you
think of beef onion and pineapple on
pizza being onion pie why not sorry that
sounds pretty good you know you could do
like a barbecue sauce oh oh like regular
pizza sauce yeah you could do it like a
red sauce you think would be the best
sauce without red sauce first yeah I
wouldn't go a white sauce on that nah
I'm gonna be very good but barbecue
would meet you that either
yeah barbecue would be good I'd be into
part be careful you'll be very sweet
yeah I'm super into sweet pizza Oh have
you had dessert pizza before like the
ice cream once fired no no fire crust is
dessert
calzones okay pretty good is the Chevy
bolt review still works I still want to
do it I'm like disappointed that they
discontinued my car yeah it's dead oh
yeah bolts dead they laid off everyone
like it's a huge mess
Linus tech tips cable ties whole look
not in focus
yeah I miss tech tips cable ties so
these are the first edition came though
I guess I don't have to do this one yeah
so basically they're just like regular
cable ties see that they're gonna hook
and loop fastener we can't take velcro
cuz they're not
except they have LTTE oh my gosh to hear
that yeah that is that is literally the
only difference there you go bouncing
focus they're like pretty nice though in
fire Jake promote Colton and pineapple
on pizza hell yeah put that on there so
you get that little LT to there it's not
orange no okay I can wait we wanted to
match people's color schemes we'll
probably do like more options later
special edition special edition you know
just more options like we'll probably do
more colors more lanes all that kind of
stuff that people like yeah I got this
there you go one-handed motherboard
install wide there we go oh man I
rehearsed what I need to do you mind
moving this thank you sir
first what I need to do oh man I got to
shift my grin no I'm gonna put it down
to do that though I'm not not gonna pull
another one of those midair grip shifts
so first I need to kind of get the
cables out of the way that are in there
and cable manager already yeah
then I need to lower it in this hole
this is terrible Oh God the noises hold
on hold on I got this it's fine it's all
good that's just the i/o shield
chill out everybody
no no it was the IO shield thing it was
definitely not right there's definitely
the CPU cooler no yep you're entitled to
your own opinion all right I just need
to get it in a little further what am i
aiming at here you know like what am i
what am i aiming for
maybe says Marmite on pizza is the best
no MAPE is objectively wrong so now he's
up to almost $200 now I think he is that
exactly $200 hey what the heck
okay Alex you sabotage me here but
whoever took this out of the previous
system gosh left a fricken whatever this
is in one of the motherboard standoffs
what the hell is this doing here
oh there's a there's a nice get in there
there's a there's a nut here and a screw
screwed into this nut in this standoff I
was trying to put this two of them in
the standoff I was trying to put on the
nubbin to get it aligned I had it I
completely had it yeah yeah probably
oh no that's not right oh man fires but
you're only left hand okay
I think well are you guys allowed to
help me like it was the right size I
think that for this it's fine okay this
is like not fair is it just really so
why the hell oh no no no that's fine
okay this is so dumb who did this
how are you no not me most assuredly not
me
Tanner says fire them both hire me and
I'll buy you pizza okay I'm just using
my hand because
is not fair Colton just sabotaged me Oh
what what what that was just been held
on wait what what school I just come
where's the other one what but somebody
used oh where they can't sense at all
okay no I think you can just take that
off yes here yeah it's supposed to be
held on by the motherboard screws but
there's no motherboard screw somebody
put a nut on it for some reason
okay okay number two okay is this even
an MDOT two heatsink no this actually
has like thermal pads on it like yeah
these guys right here is is that a
problem that that this piece is not on
that other motherboard classic you make
me adjust the camera it's probably all
right one-handed motherboard install
here we go let's try again and like
honestly it's it's kind of cheating with
this board because it's it's got a
built-in backplate like there's not a
lot I can do the screwed up to be clear
I would not do this with just any
motherboard like I'm I'm pretending to
be very reckless right now what is not a
big deal it's still very crusty yeah I
mean it's some optimal like I wouldn't
recommend it I'm just saying it's not as
big of a deal as it might seem like it
is used F really there we go all right
grungy no no that's fine I'll go from
the right spot I'm not sure Alex I'm not
sure okay
is that that nothing like poking through
there yet no there we go ah it's in
motherboards in so here's a stupid thing
there's no way to put this on because
this one doesn't have a screw you just
for once per I guess we could just put
the one screw in all right okay and
you're allowed to help with this part
right cuz I helped last time yeah yeah
oh cool are those 632 threaded or they
the finer and whatever 32 so I can't use
the screws and nuts that we're already
in that thing that is so weird I wonder
if that comes like that from the factory
like maybe it's for like oh I think it's
an accessory I think it's for the I
think it's the like overclocking kit
yeah so we probably used this for yeah
Anthony did the video on that hmm yeah
blame Anthony yes so I think he just
left it on so I think we can just take
it off that's why this heatsink
has an inventory tag on it oh crap
so we need that nut where'd that not go
I don't know um okay we have no it's not
632 but you could still use the 632 no
you can't tell because you could use it
okay oh can you put this back together
please oh gosh thank you what seems
right
oh yeah no you just gotta just kind of
jam it it's not oh I see the problem
oh crap there's no fan why are there
okay in my defense that didn't happen
the first time okay I gave up on this
one-handed thing we're just gonna finish
the system we're running out of time
yeah how much time's left Kelton did you
get anything no did you get it out 18
minutes that is lots of time yeah and it
was lots of time at 30 and we've made
progress since then and it is lots of
time now
this guy says naming your Showtek link
really messes with me every time I hear
because I work at tech link Microsoft's
internal IT support oh really I didn't
know that was called that that's
hilarious
so it was actually called Tech linked
because it's a play on net linked the
show that I used to do back at NCIX
there's nothing to do with Microsoft's
tech support thing but that's very funny
and I love it
maybe says I will also probably buy
pizza just next time I'm at the office
probably 2020 hey fire Colton and I'll
be your server network data recovery
admin is that what Colton does
I don't think so yeah that is the
furthest thing total would be so not in
charge of that everything would be on
fire it'll be even worse than me doing
it which is the situation's already
pretty bad is already terrible yeah
that's true gaming and streaming PC what
an 8700 KB good
yes yeah that'd be awesome but you
should probably use nvm yeah okay yeah I
was gonna say for streaming that
probably wouldn't be CPU encoding there
yeah especially if you get a 20 Series
card not saying that you should because
it really expensive but the encoding is
really good almost so yeah yeah out of
shell I mean we talked about it
in our review the even new the new
generation and vank encoder is
significantly better than the old one on
a pixel-by-pixel basis the 10 series NBA
MC is actually slightly better than very
fast CPU encoding the 10 series or 20
series 10 series really series is better
than fast and should soon be better than
medium pink
Kabang it's pretty ballin and there with
OBS they're actually improving the
performative I'm looking forward to
laptops with 20 series technology and
then with that new hardware encoder
because then you could legit stream
without basically any compromise on a
laptop uh-huh get like Thunderbolt so
you can have a high speed external
capture card so you can take a really
nice source so it says let us buy win
hoodies again there's new hoodies coming
yeah there's new hoodies coming the LAN
hoodie is
most definitely dead forever the new
hoodies are really nice though so just
yeah should be fine and hopefully not
absurdly effective like bath time yet so
the thing about the land hoodie is it
was really expensive because it was
really expensive like it like tomatoes
yeah we got it from like there's a
middle party that was definitely taking
a sizable cut on that production run but
it was the only way that we could really
manage it at that time we were a really
small company we couldn't afford to like
have a dedicated person to like call up
every textile factory in like China and
Pakistan to like deal with that kind of
thing so
Jamis tea is wondering you guys always
use CS to test who is the highest rank
in the office oh definitely at Edsel he
is straight up elite no I got probably
Co gone pro that won't fit this
overhangs it oh yeah that's that's why
there's a long message from Austria it
missed the second ten-year stream first
one bugged out before I got to send the
super chat wanted to say thanks for the
decade of awesome videos hope there's
another decade keep up the great work
- mrs. Linus and the crew oh that's for
2019 wow that's really nice thanks
Andrew we hope for another decade too
but I'd have to like live that long oh
yeah I see what you do give me those
side notions
yeah Dawg so guess what we are now less
than probably like three minutes okay
I'm saying three minutes we're three
minutes from testing rig number three
Colton
what's our time at sir we challenged
Colton where's Colton challenged us he
said that we were not going to finish
three systems in two hours you were at
1:45 so you got 15 minutes we have 15
more minutes to finish a rig that is
basically done do I owe you guys
anything if you win no okay good you
just have to live with that for the rest
of my life you have to live that I was
right and you were wrong
oh no it's the worst it's the worst
experience of all time
yeah I agree yeah cuz Jake's experienced
it a couple of times not many but a
couple of times I feel like there's been
more to the other way but you just
pretend like it's not happening I'll be
like this well spend like ten minutes
trying to fix the thing and then the
thing that I said originally was right
and then he's like well whatever
somebody screws up here okay that's what
this okay and are you kind of keeping
track of other things back here cuz this
looks kind of like a gong show no it's
not a gong show I have it's a gong show
yeah okay
tell you what how about while I finish
this up you uncanny Undong show it a
little bit ddong show fight are we
having technical difficulties on the
stream I can't get this type-c connector
in here
what the crap get in there dang it try
it both ways it's a typical USB thing
USB things you try it one way oh that's
not it then you try the other way to go
what the crap is not going in what the
heck watch this suck up the last 15
minutes of our time for this machine why
should this be the straw that breaks the
camel's back USB fellow and can I am
talking
am I talking into people's ear balls now
your balls your butt yeah that's yeah
that's not really a new one I think it's
a Mighty Car Mods thing Oh
move
oh yes yeah that thing is twisty is
hilarious and I really want to do a
dance like they did in that oh I don't
know how why I mean money did they spend
on that oh I don't know what it is
really well I've always wanted to do
that what are you still on that yeah I
can't get it in can you try can you just
put me out of my misery here I can't get
the USB 3.1 type-c nobody can see
anything you guys are doing I know we're
trying to finish because we need to make
Colton feel bad that's all most
important thing right great
yeah it's only 1:30 how are we gonna
sleep with all the coffee you've had
you've got a lot of coffee I had a bit
of coffee see see what I'm talking about
it's not going in it isn't no I still
don't think they can see what you're
talking about
no well I'm talking to Alex this guy
says it's the best Sunday morning show
in the UK let's make this a regular
thing
oh no Kolby no it's like 3:00 in the
morning I think there's just leap at the
wheel really Chubby's alright I'm sorry
oh yeah no I think that I was something
really funny I can't get the regular
usb3 in either like I think one of the
pins must be like ever so slightly
misaligned or something because it is
not having it and like you can't force
this one gotta be real careful with this
one yeah I know those things are
horrible yeah they're the worst
connector in the modern PC yeah I can I
can actually
see which one it is now but it's really
hard to fix because it's a right angle
connector so I need the board like out
in order to fix this so he gets no front
USB whatsoever
oh poor James Davis give him a dongle
yep David Orr says he lives in the San
Francisco Bay Area I he just got home
from work he's a chef who loves tech and
this is perfect time to find an LTT
street also love the stream with Yvonne
it says if - Media Group ever wants an
on-campus dining room to hit them up an
on-campus dining room hire an on-campus
chef that would be sick so first I'll
make this part of the land center yeah I
will check out a full kitchen we can get
rid of the gaming piece Jake that's your
whole contribution to the endeavor is to
mock it up only that's only thinking
like rev it seems like it'd be fairly
inexpensive yeah I think we should yeah
totally it's the bits the head count
that costs money not the kitchen will be
pretty expensive renovating a kitchen is
not that big of a deal hiring a
full-time person to do nothing but cook
for your other staff that's sort of a
big deal okay we're ready yeah we're
ready to fire up the last one with no
front USB because hashtag take that
James did this not power on no you gotta
be kidding me okay oh there we go oh did
just take a while no the power squid
must be off or something when you hit
that it turned on for a second yeah like
it's on now oh just loose must be okay
we're good no it's turned off again what
hang out yeah we're good okay all right
no apparently there's the fast as
possible where you say you prefer to you
know Ruby or IPs what for what though
for what okay remember this a long time
ago yes for like for FPS gaming back
when IPS was only available at 60 Hertz
high refresh
yes oh yeah high refresh rate yes high
five so good hasn't always been a thing
ultra-wide - even though it's not great
for competitive gaming it's so nice yeah
oh we got past detect memory that's the
hard one okay cool that's a good sign we
didn't plug in either of this case fans
this is definitely by far our sloppiest
I'm there okay
heck yeah you gotta plug in those fans
or you're not done I'm plugging it in do
we have to inspect them at the end make
sure they did it right yes three systems
less than two hours not even speed built
and we ate pizza and they dicked around
make coffee if it makes you guys feel
better I asked like three other people
and they all said that you guys won't be
able to do it in time so just so you
guys know so that's to make us feel
better
telling us that no one believes in us
now I've admitted if I just fire cool
them then hire the chef get a hair cool
okay not even the worst idea I've ever
heard dick a decade I think take a big
fan - you gave me the confidence to
build my own consistent n system own
system have a great night oh it's
morning now actually yeah it's all of
you most assuredly morning at sixty-five
thousand a year for a chef then
depending on what you want to eat could
be $200 a day for food yeah pretty
person or twenty yeah that's gonna be
more than two that sounds good white
reason yes for 21 people what have you
just like that's a great values
everything I think it cost yeah
still I think what if we just eat ramen
all guys get chicken nuggets I'm not
hiring a chef to cook ramen noodles
Ramin stupid like some twisting wall
draw every single day
I'd like some caviar and the tomahawk
steak everyday lobster every single day
yeah the whole budget goes to one thing
all right have planes Street we apply
Misha Alex and I won the game wha
so guys what you got to show them three
systems you gotta bring no I'm not
actually old so guys the stream today
brought to you by madrenas from now
until December seventh you get 50% off
with Africa was it - you thought for
code lioness I can't keep track of all
the Africa I told this guy I told this
guy look you need to get me you need to
get the vanity URL the same on all of
our sponsor he's like I can't like what
do you mean you can't why why can't it
just be the same why can't it be
squarespace.com / the same and just the
dream is calm / the same thing no he
says he can't anyway what what what he
also can't do is predict accurately
whether alex and i can build three
systems in two hours because we did
anyway so 50% off using offer code linus
over on madrenas we're gonna have that
linked below and then we're also
announcing the Lambo roast so this is
our Linus tech tips roast it's available
for pre-order I know we always say don't
pre-order stuff but like ok look we've
already had it fine you don't have to
pay yeah oh yeah yeah and right we tried
it so it's all good and by we I mean I
actually was like out of office while
they were doing this whole thing anyway
they assured me it's great and we had
like 10th what 10 12 people on staff try
it ok cool good
ok I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to
I'm gonna have to tell you what first
bag that arrives I'm gonna try it
because it's kind of like the worst kept
secret ever I actually don't drink
coffee so there's that I'm gonna try it
am I gonna and I gonna need like milk or
like sugar
probably some iced tea or something all
right there you go there you go so there
you go
you guys can pre-order that down below
I'm effectively pre-ordering it like
I've got a pretty significant investment
into this thing you've got our own like
custom bag and stuff I'm pretty sure
Lloyd spent like three weeks designing
it she comes in so he comes in my office
is great he comes into my office with
like four coffee bags all of them like
completely like scratch design he's like
which one do you like the best I'm kind
of looking at it going wouldn't it have
been a good idea to just show me like
some concepts on your screen before you
printed them all and like painstakingly
folded the sub
bags he likes like I pulled all of the
edges because we didn't have like all of
the right equipment
perfect we unfortunately don't have them
otherwise so funny anyway so we're gonna
have the ltte roast also we're
announcing that I think probably we're
doing a roast of me so are we like
selling tickets to this like people can
attendance people but everybody else to
be able to watch it and it'll be great
give me a pretty big production all
right so thanks to madrenas for
sponsoring the stream today thanks to
you guys for tuning in in the middle of
the freaking night all 20,000 W that
watched this mess although it wasn't a
mess for anyone except Colton who was
wrong today who was wrong about how
quickly Alex and I who are PC building
chance by the way can build systems I
don't know if I'd say rich hams but
we're competent yeah we have experience
oh we just do basically were just better
at it than cool if you liked it hit like
and subscribe okay kill it I'm done I'm
not doing the outro wait come on please
no I'm not doing hey Hach like fire cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
