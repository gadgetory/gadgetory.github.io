design core 3000 case but the first time
I had the pleasure of setting eyes on
this case was actually at CES 2011 and
it was there that fractal actually
launched a ton of new case designs
including their core series the arc
series and then mostly the core series
in the arc series the define XL and the
define our three we're both already on
the market at the time I believe so here
we go
fractal design basically they hit the
market with smart designs good value
cases aimed at a silent PC user with the
core series as well as the arc series
actually they're getting away from the
pure silence image and moving towards a
little bit more of the gaming oriented
user so you want more airflow you want a
more aggressive looking case as opposed
to just clean sleek lines well then the
core series or the arc series might be
for you comes with the user's manual
which comes in a bag and then it comes
with a case so that's pretty much all
there is to it once again we are very
used to seeing on fractal cases just a
clean overall aesthetic and we are
definitely our expectations are met with
the core 3000 so the very front is just
a plain perforated grille the whole
front of the case is made up of air flow
vents sorry I'm doing these thumb screws
on the side panels here so I'm a little
bit distracted but I'm gonna pull off
you know what here let's pull up the
side panels first we'll look at the
front in a minute cameraman so the side
panel comes off like that
no noise dampening material on the
inside this is more of a value oriented
case and it is not does not have some of
the premium features of the define our
three in the define XL let's have a look
at the front so you can see that there
are mounting options for two 140
millimeter fans here in the front okay
you can see those there and you can
actually see one of the fans through the
front of the case this I'm not sure how
it comes out but it couldn't be that
complicated to figure out it comes off
like this I think you have to give me a
moment to figure that out the front of
the case has a headphone port microphone
port harddrive LED power LED reset
button power button and four USB 2.0
ports we've got two five and a quarter
inch base and then the rest of this is
just made up of filtered airflow space
and other than that is very clean very
sleek looking on the other side we have
mounting holes for a 120 millimeter or
140 millimeter fan positioned over the
video card portion of the inside of your
chassis I can go ahead and take that off
see the inside used is a very standard
mounting system for the side panel and
then on the inside you will find a
couple of things so first we'll find
some accessories now on now I'm being
driven crazy by this let's go ahead oh
there it goes okay so there that's how
to install another fan actually it looks
like the bottom one is only 120 mil so
this is 140 ml and then the bottom spot
holds a 120 mil fence you can go ahead
that comes with a sleeve cable fractal
fans are all quite quiet so even though
this is a gamer oriented case it does
come with the same quiet fans as their
define series so you can see all of the
hard drive mounting cages through here
we are using let's say three here and
then three on the bottom these are all
compatible with three and a half inch
and two and a half inch drives also on
the inside we find our accessory box
which includes motherboard screws cable
ties as well as their pc i mounted fan
controller we've got one five and a
quarter to three and a half inch bay
adapter so if you still use a floppy
drive or if you have a card reader or
something like that you can go ahead and
install that in the front these are the
dried sleds I was talking about before
so you can see here the mounting holes
one two three four four two and a half
inch drives or one two three four with
the rubber
it's for three and a half inch drives on
the inside of the case you can see we
have room for a standard ATX motherboard
so not a whole lot of extra wood so I
wouldn't expect to be installing like a
rampage three extreme or anything like
that in this case but any standard sized
ATX motherboard will fit in just fine
speaking of standard size it does have
seven PCI slots at the back so once
again you won't be installing any XL ATX
that is extended length boards but any
normal board will be installed just fine
all of your front panel connectors are
here they are all saved in black so
we've got one two USB we've got our HD
audio for the front panel as well as our
power LED reset switch power switch and
all that good stuff the power supply is
bottom mounted we've got little rubber
feet here as well as a filtered air
intake below the power supply so you'll
be able to install your power supply
with the fan facing down which allows it
to take in fresh air from under the case
rather than taking in hot air from your
video card or other components they've
included all of the lips or silicon here
they've included all of the screen
mounting holes so you can install your
power supply right side up or upside
down whichever fan orientation you
prefer we've got a cutout in the back of
the motherboard tray which allows us to
install or uninstall the CPU cooler even
if it has a backplate without taking the
motherboard out as well as up here okay
yep we've got 120 or 140 millimeter fan
mounts on the top so you can see it
comes to the 140 here comes with 120 in
the back and in here you can put either
another 140 or a 120 millimeter fan
because of the clearance around this
120mm fan I wouldn't expect to have any
difficulty installing one of those
pre-done up water cooling kits so that
is definitely a plus because those can
offer an unprecedented balance of
silence and performance here on the back
you can see that actually left a fairly
decent amount of space between the side
panel and the motherboard tray as well
as providing these little loops to
attach zip ties to and then clip down
your wires to make sure that your cable
management stays tidy at the back of the
case and you've included a couple of
hols for cable routing although as I
said before this is not as premium at
cases the defined series so you don't
have the rubber grommets to help them
make a little bit look make them look a
little bit more stealthy but I think it
is a pretty reasonable compromise to
make considering the price of the arc
3000 or core 3000 thank you for checking
