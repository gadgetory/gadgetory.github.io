our pics from their sweet gift guide
it's an easy way to get awesome ideas
and everything on the list is eligible
for two-day shipping if you're a Prime
member so today we're focused on gadgets
and gizmos so grab a candy cane and
let's start stuffing some stockings
first up is the DJI Mavic pro because
let's face it you got bored of that $35
runs on double A's drone from last
Christmas after about half an hour what
I love about the Maverick Pro is its
balance between robustness and
portability the rotor arms fold up so
you don't have to lug a giant suitcase
into the wilderness every time you want
to fly plus its size makes it more agile
in tight spaces than DJI is more
expensive phantom4 line up you literally
could put this thing in someone stalking
the included controller is compact too
but it still feels good in the hands and
you can use it independently or with a
smartphone plugged in for a first-person
view of what's going on up to seven
freaking kilometers away depending on
local regulations and don't let the
Mavic pro's diminutive size fool you
this is a high quality product worthy of
its thousand dollar price tag it records
4k gimbal stabilized videos it's got a
sophisticated array of sensors
it runs for thirty minutes between
charges and it goes up to 65 kilometers
an hour that's as fast as the world's
fastest Marine Mammal the common dolphin
can't afford all those cameras and
sensors how about just one logitech
staple webcam the c920 features full
1920 by 1080 HD videorecording
video calling and of course good
old-fashioned selfies it's got 20 step
autofocus and software and stereo
microphones making it perfect for video
calls or even streaming in fact this is
pretty much the de-facto starter
streaming camera and logitech includes
lots of options for mounting you can
clip it onto the top of your monitor or
attach it to a tripod or any other
accessory using the standard 1/4 20 BSW
mount we have tons of these things
around the office and they're great for
everything including conference calls
because the built-in noise cancelling is
good enough from my experience that in
most cases I don't even need to use
headphones for the other participants
not to hear their own echo on the
subject of echo our next item is
actually not an echo that would be too
obvious
it's the Rumba 890 and it's got some
neato features over the lower tiered
models like tangle free brushes high
efficiency filters and five times the
suck this is a great gift for anyone on
your list and no not just mom or the
wife not only are you sexist for saying
that you're also wrong because there is
nothing more masculine than being lazy
about cleaning the 890 is Wi-Fi
connected with a companion app so you
can schedule cleaning times start and
stop vacuuming and monitor cleaning
cycles all from the comfort of the
toilet and it'll even send you a
notification when the dust bin needs
emptying so that you can avoid that part
of the house until somebody else does it
not easy enough for you it even
integrates with Amazon echo see I was
going somewhere with that so you can
just yell from your bed and your
benevolent robot slave will spring to
life and do your bidding autumn
magically returning to its charging dock
when it's finished there has never been
a better time to be human it even has
what I call Hunter Killer mode where it
uses optical and acoustic sensors to
detect high concentrations of dirt dust
and pet hair and then perform focused
cleaning where it's needed most
automatically adjusting brush height for
whatever floor type you've got and using
cliff detect sensors to not kill itself
on the stairs but what if you want ten
times the suck then you need the Roomba
980 remember the room but you thought
was amazing just like a few seconds ago
well forget that because this one is the
real bomb it's got enhanced machine
vision to more easily navigate your home
gets not one but two hours of battery
life and will actually recharge itself
as needed until your entire house is
clean except for up or down the stairs
and under rugs I mean it's still a
Roomba the last item in our gift guide
is the house cleaner NVIDIA GTX it
no just actually I'm kidding it's it's a
cleaning accessory but look at those
aggressive gamer angles for real though
this is the Bissell
pet stain eraser and it doesn't just
work on Bissell's pet stains it'll work
on your pet stains too so if like me
your jokes are so
cringe that even your pets throw up and
then you need this on your wish list
it's completely wireless with a lithium
ion battery super portable at under five
pounds and boasts that it instantly and
permanently remove stains like urine
feces vomit dirt mud blood and more but
lightest how in Sciences name is this
possible well it's the triple threat of
spray scrub and suction action that
clean spots and stains from a wide
variety of surfaces this puppy runs for
15 minutes and charges in just four
hours
and if you need it more often than that
then it's probably time to get new pets
or stop getting pets because clearly you
have enough urine feces vomit dirt mud
and blood and more on your what is the
more what is the more at that point do
you need more anyway thanks for watching
