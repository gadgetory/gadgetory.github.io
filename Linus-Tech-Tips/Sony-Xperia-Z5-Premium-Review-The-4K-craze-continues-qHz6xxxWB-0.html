amazing Xperia z5 premium featuring an
astonishing 4k screen it's everything
you've ever seen and done a hundred
times but now in 4k yes friends 4k is
the future and the future is now
the Scimitar RGB from coarser features
17 programmable buttons a 12000 DPI
optical sensor and a shape designed for
comfort and MMO and MOBA games learn
more at the link in the video
description alright so I guess that
silly intro bit gives away some of my
concluding thoughts on the z5 premium
but I've got a bit of a routine to run
through here so let's get that stuff out
of the way first if you've seen one
Sony's e-series device you've pretty
much seen them all at this point
so the z5 premium holds not too many
surprises up its sleeves it's got a
blocky shape with an unadorned back
panel save for the camera and flash a
micro be charging port with wrist strap
loop on the bottom a dedicated shutter
button volume rocker and a lock button
with integrated fingerprint sensor on
the right a headphone jack and noise
cancellation microphone on the top and
finally ok I guess it does have some
surprises a microSD expansion slot along
with a dual SIM card tray making this
phone a winner for frequent travelers
who load up a lot of media for trips and
have phone plans in multiple countries
or even just people who want to save a
few bucks here and there leveraging
cheaper data on one carrier and cheaper
voice on another for example at the
front are dual forward-facing speakers a
selfie camera and the main event the 4k
screen but I'll talk more about that
later the ergonomics of this phone were
a bit of a mixed bag for me I mean I
liked the design of the iPhone 4 a lot
and I still do but one of the reasons
that the the like heavy blocky
solid feeling metal and glass design
worked so well was that it was small and
therefore easy to handle without
dropping and this carried over quite
nicely to my new daily driver the Xperia
z5 compact which I reviewed quite
recently but at the size of the premium
variant I mean we're talking about a 5.5
inch display phone here with substantial
forehead and chin bar areas it is pretty
darn
unwieldly a curved back and lighter
construction would likely go a long way
to
remedying this for me but there are some
trade-offs there as well to a man or
lady every phone person who touched the
z5 premium or saw me using it said
something along the lines of wow it
really lives up to the premium name and
that was without getting to experience
the 4k screen which I guess leads us
pretty well into the screen first things
first
at this pixel density we're talking a
whopping 800 pixels per inch it's a
freaking miracle that Sony managed to
get a back light to shine through the
electronics at all the fact that they
also managed to deliver a bright
accurate display to boot is a freaking
miracle but there's some bad news about
the screen as well in the time that I
was using the phone it actually almost
never ran at its 4k native resolution
this is for a couple of reasons number
one is that Android lollipop doesn't
have proper 4k support so it'll only
switch in a couple of apps two of which
by the way our Sony's own album and
video apps but even though that will be
rectified in the future some what dpi
support is kind of an issue - problem
number two the fact that running at 4k
puts unneeded strain on the phone's
processor sapping battery life means
that even after the Android marshmallow
update Sony will likely leave this
limitation in place so there you go most
of the time your 4k display will be
running at 1080p instead something that
in the past I would have liked dropped
the phone like a hot potato and said uh
run away run away because running LCD
displays that anything but native
resolution has traditionally destroyed
text sharpness but in this case actually
it was just fine and I wouldn't have
even noticed that it has a 4k display if
you didn't tell me in fact 4k content
even didn't look materially different
from sharpened 1080p content at this
size which raises the entirely new
question of well what is the point then
to which I would reply Android handset
makers Sony include
just don't know how else to
differentiate from the crowd I mean look
at the rest of the specs of this phone
two gigahertz Snapdragon 810 CPU with
adreno 430 GPU 3 gigabytes of RAM AC
Wi-Fi NFC FM radio quick charge 2.0 fast
charging fingerprint scanner I mean it's
got everything but the kitchen sink and
hell if Sony shipped it with one of
those it would just be a great
demonstration of the ip68 water and dust
protection the thing would still work I
mean that is some fairly stand out stuff
I mean the Snapdragon 810 is still a
mini furnace that thermal throttles
noticeably after only a few Geekbench
runs but performance is still well
within the acceptable range and anyway
what else is Sony supposed to use and
therein lies the problem no matter what
gimmick Android makers throw at their
premium devices they can't differentiate
from each other let alone from Apple I
mean it wasn't that long ago that having
front-facing speakers made headlines and
if you had a solid camera on an Android
device you were going to sell a lot of
units but the z5 premium has both of
these things the camera which I actually
glossed over earlier by the way is a 23
megapixel affair with 4k 30fps video
recording slo-mo and it performed
admirably in my typical full auto
testing of the device but today those
things amount to nothing Android phone
makers have given it everything they've
got and people are still buying iPhones
in greater numbers than ever before so
what do they do well they go back to
bigger and better numbers even if it's
actually meaningless like even more
meaningless than ever before like we
turned it off 99% of the time
meaningless it's kind of a shame though
because from reading other folks reviews
of the z5 premium it feels like Sony and
therefore everyone covering the phone
got so focused on the 4k display that
they missed that this is also just a
really solid device the 30 for 30
milliamp hour battery got me comfortably
through everyday while I was using it
and Sony's OS skin continues to
small evolutionary improvements without
ruining the Android experience which is
which is sweet but just not enough to
win me over or to recommend that
especially for the price Wow you run out
and buy one and on that subject D brand
makers of the high quality of vinyl
skins that you see on the devices in our
phone reviews now I could spend some
time telling you that D brand is very
affordable
they have inexpensive shipping around
the freaking world their skins are high
quality and they're cut precisely and
they've got a bunch of different styles
but I'm not not going to tell you any of
that stuff I'm going to tell you today
is that D brand actually has a special
exclusive 48 hour only color it is an
orange carbon fiber the same one that
you saw in scrapyard war season 3 on the
back of my macbook that's kind of like
an LT t orange so you guys are going to
want to check that out at the link in
the video description right below
they've can put it on a phone they can
put it on a console they can put it on a
computer pretty much you name it they'll
put it on it unless it's like your
grandmother I don't know why you would
want a vinyl skin on your grandmother I
mean I guess it would protect her from
incidental scrapes and scratches and
make her look better maybe there's
something to this anyway guys thanks for
