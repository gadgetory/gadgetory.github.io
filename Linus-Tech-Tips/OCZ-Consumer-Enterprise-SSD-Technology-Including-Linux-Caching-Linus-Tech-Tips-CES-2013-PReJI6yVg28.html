our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys in the OCZ suite on the consumer
side we start with the vertex 3 so this
is a SAN force based Drive honestly the
problem with something like a SAN force
base Drive at this point in time is that
pretty much everyone and their dog has a
SandForce Drive so you just have to rely
on add-ons like extra warranty or you
know just that sort of the the general
brand perception in order to drive sales
so vertex 4 was an obvious an obvious
thing for us easy to do after they
acquired into links it does use a
third-party controller the actual
physical controller on the chip but it
uses an end links firmware so they're
calling that the Everest 2 platform and
it achieves performance that in almost
any case is as good as the vertex 3 but
in cases where you're dealing with
incompressible data is actually better
so it's a more consistent experience
right here we have the latest drive that
OC Z's launch so these two are gonna be
the ones they're more focused on moving
forwards with their in the Lynx
technology inside this one not only uses
an in delink
firmware to control the SSD itself but
it also has the barefoot three
controller which is the first silicon
that was actually designed in-house by
OCZ
to deliver the best possible performance
this drive took something along the
lines of 18 months to bring to market so
they were already working on this six
months before CES last year it has a
five-year warranty and it has
industry-leading performance it is right
up there with any other tuna 1/2 inch
SSD drive because that is pretty much as
good as we can do for a two and a half
inch SATA 3 Drive at this point because
the SATA interface is getting pretty
close to the limit so let's talk about
what we can do if we move beyond the
SATA interface now we've seen Revo drive
products from OCZ in the past and
they're doing away with that branding
this time or maybe they're not it looks
like there's a yeah specifications are
preliminary and subject to change so
this is the vector PCIe this is going to
use to into links barefoot three
controllers it uses 32
and chips it comes with cloning software
it has a five year warranty it's gonna
be available in capacities up to one
terabyte and it uses a PCI Express Gen 2
4x interface giving it a theoretical
maximum bandwidth of two gigabytes per
second now in the real world it's
capable of achieving about one gigabyte
per second and you're gonna see that on
the screen to my right your left but
there's a lot of overhead involved in
the PCI Express interface so really to
get ahead of this in terms of
performance they'd either have to add
more lanes making it an 8 X card or move
to PCIe gen3 now with these storage
devices there's a lot of validation that
goes into them because most PCI Express
slots on motherboards on the motherboard
manufacture side are only really
validated with mainstream stuff like
graphics cards and sound cards so in the
past there have been some finicky issues
so moving ahead to the newest technology
that at this point is only even
supported on Intel and not even on the
AMD side might not have made sense and
honestly looking at previous generation
products you didn't see the same kind of
scaling going from 2 controllers to 4
controllers that you saw going from 1 to
2 so speaking of the performance scaling
from 1 to 2 you can see that compared to
what a single drive is able to do on the
SATA 3 interface we're able to see
consistent performance above sort of
anything above about 32 kilobytes where
you're sitting around Hubble's still
above 800 megabytes per second reads and
writes this drive can consistently
deliver about a thousand megabytes per
second reads and writes so this is
comparable to something that I had to
build for myself using an LSI card that
cost me about 700 bucks
and back in the sand Force One days I
needed 8 drives to achieve that kind of
performance so we're only a few
generations ahead of that but we're
already looking at performance that's
basically space-age compared to what we
had not that long ago in our vector SSD
unboxing we talked about how OCC is
changing their image redefining their
processes internally and trying to
refocus right now so let's have a look
at sort of the the existing generation
of enterprise SSDs I don't know if you
guys are familiar with these or not but
this one was actually at CES last year
already it's available in up to 3 point
2 terabyte capacities and I know the
internet loves to talk about
sort of the one terabyte drives that are
out or coming out or but the reality of
it is though Suzie's had things like you
know 3.2 terabyte drives on PCIe 800
terabyte drives using a SAS interface on
tuna 1/2 inch form factor for actually
quite a while now so it's it's
interesting I mean this is this is all
that stuff that we've seen before but I
have Jerome here from OCZ to tell us
about something that's actually all-new
and uses unlike these previous
generation solutions which are using
sand force controllers sand force sand
force driven kind of firmware updates
this guy right here is actually using
OCC's own intellectual property so tell
us about the intrepid three right so
thanks so this is our intrepid 3
products this is our next-generation
Santa product so as you mentioned this
is using our in-house controller Everest
to controller and this is gonna be an
evolution of our existing set of
products like our deneva 2 so with
intrepid 3 you're gonna get higher
performance for sequential also higher
performance for random input/output
operations per second and this one's
also optimized for incompressible data
boniva 2 is optimized for compressible
and intrepid threes gonna give you a
really great performance for
incompressible data so these two
solutions are potentially complementary
to each other okay so I mean it's
there's a lot of guys that make SSDs so
I think the differentiation really comes
from a few different factors so number
one is the variety of the solutions
number two is gonna be the support
that's provided number three quality of
the components that are being used and
number four is gonna be sort of how you
guys differentiate yourselves in the
market and sort of that that X Factor
thing so this is something we discussed
on our live stream we do the live
streams every Friday night when ocz
announced this but ocz has a solution
now for accelerating volumes whether
it's using a PCIe solution a SATA
solution a solution on Linux platforms
as well as what other platforms so why
don't you tell us we're gonna wait for
this demo to restart at the beginning
and we're gonna get drum to walk us
through it
okay so here we're showing OCC's new
solution for linux acceleration this is
our lxl platform so what we're doing
here is we're showing in our stores pro
excel management software you can see we
have de Nieva and a z drive
Oh see see volumes installed and what
we're doing here is we're selecting the
existing volumes that you want to
accelerate so we're picking the OCZ
volumes here as cache volumes and our
Excel software automatically you know
pre discovers all the volumes and here
you can see the existing volumes that
you're going to accelerate so we're
selecting those so what we've done so
far is we've already selected the OCZ
volumes they'd be uses cache now we're
selecting the volumes to be accelerated
and here you can see we're selecting the
policies to be used for the acceleration
so essentially these will tell you what
data to put in the cache what's the hot
data so we have some pre-configured
algorithms as well as you can select
custom algorithms so now there we've
selected the volumes now they're
accelerated and we're gonna move over
you can see in the summary all the four
volumes that were installed are now
accelerated with the OCZ deneva and the
OCZ to be clear guys the volumes that
are being accelerated here are gonna be
mechanical volumes that were a site that
an SSD volume is then being assigned to
to cache now I can tell you guys right
now looking at the interface for this
assuming it's gonna work this way in the
final model check this out guys fifteen
fifteen thousand one hundred fifty
fifteen thousand total I ops per second
which is much better than you can do
with any mechanical volume as we're
about to see when they actually turn the
volume acceleration off this is much
easier than what I've seen in
implementations from LSI and Adaptec in
their raid storage managers and not
nearly as restrictive because you can
take SATA drives you can take PCIe
drives you can clump them together you
can separate them apart so you could say
you've got a 1.6 terabyte Revo drive you
go I want one terabyte for dedicated SSD
storage I want 600 gigabytes
that's gonna actually cache a mechanical
volume I have somewhere else on the
server this is extremely exciting
because up until now there's been no
real caching solution for SSD available
in Linux at all in spite of that being
where most of this most of the server
data is actually dealt with now is this
just gonna be Linux are you guys gonna
have other solutions as well we're gonna
have other solutions as well we already
have a solution for VMware it's called
VXL the Linux solution is called lxl as
we've discussed and we can also have a
Windows solution which would be called
wxl thanks so much Jerome this has been
very helpful and don't miss any of our
