something I've never seen before and it
is a retail box intel SSD now that may
seem like a weird thing for me to have
never seen before but I haven't and the
reason for that is I've only seen the
OEM ones which come in like a little
brown box you break the seal it has like
a little manual in it and a drive and
that's it
so this is a retail kit so it includes
all of the usual information that comes
on a retail box first of all they tell
you the capacity this is a 40 gig Drive
from their ex 25 V series so the V
series is pretty much like the M series
except for a couple key differences the
differences are mostly in terms of right
now capacity so the M series is from 80
to 160 gigs and in terms of performance
particularly on the sequential reads and
writes the V series does not perform as
well as the M series which as you'll see
if you check out the benchmarks for this
drive online is not actually that
important in terms of performance so a
lot of people have found that this brand
new V series is a really good compromise
between price and performance so let me
see yeah they actually cover that on the
side here so they show you that in terms
of rugged silent solid okay they're all
the same in terms of low power they are
all the same but in terms of performance
it goes from the 40 gig with one check
mark to the 80 gig X 25m with two check
marks to the 160 gig X 25m with three
check marks the 160 gig actually does
perform a little bit better than the 80
gig but in terms of real world that
don't think you'd really notice it so
let's get this box opened up and inside
we will find a brown box
okay so I've never opened one of these
before so I don't actually know how but
it looks like it's ah there we go okay
that's gonna cover so comes up this way
and there is our X 25 V 40 gig SSD but
let's have a look at the accessories
that come with it first so there's
little tray comes like okay that's very
nice my SSD rocks sticker how can you go
wrong with a sticker like that very cool
okay then we've got a little Intel
product information cheap Intelsat a
solid-state
drive and it unfolds to reveal that
intel recommends that this be
professionally installed blah blah blah
whatever it's really easy to install a
drive okay it comes with a warranty and
installation guide disk okay so one of
those little mini CDs and then in here
we will find still more accessories so
you got some mounting screws five of
each in case you lose one that's really
nice of them to include and Intel
actually includes in their retail box a
two and a half inch to three and yeah
three and a half inch drive the adapter
so that's really nice you actually screw
the drive on to here and then with this
particular adapter you can use the
screws from the side to mount or even at
the bottom to mount it anywhere are
three and a half inch drive would go
thank you very much okay so let's get to
the drive itself so we got our little
observe precautions be very careful when
you're handling this wow that is a nasty
sticker so yeah if that sticker it
doesn't show obvious signs of being
broken then you know you're getting a
brand new drive so like most of the
other Intel drives it includes a little
plastic bracket around the top that's to
allow installation in notebooks that
only accept the thinner drives and that
it also allows installation in notebooks
that only accept the thicker drive so
you can either take out all four screws
remove the little plastic bracket and
then put the screws back in or you can
just leave it as is so you can there's
not a whole lot to show you about this
okay so you got your mounting holes on
each side okay once again that's to
ensure that you can mount it anywhere a
two and a half inch drag would go you've
got your mounting holes on the bottom
and then you've got your standard sata2
interface on the back with both SATA 2
data and say 2 to power thank you for
checking out my quick unboxing of the
Intel X 25 V 40 gig Drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
