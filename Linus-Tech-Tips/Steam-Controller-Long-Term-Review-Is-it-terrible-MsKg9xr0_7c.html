review is going to be kind of weird just
straight-up feature to feature comparing
it against the standard style controller
like one made by Microsoft or Sony for
their game consoles is useless and it
definitely is not a wiimote so what do
we do well we're going to go on an
adventure investigating the games and
game types that this controller works
well or doesn't work well with by the
end of this adventure I don't expect you
to think that the controller isn't weird
but I expect you to understand when I
say weird I don't mean bad some of the
best things and people I know are weird
hi Karin also I believe that you'll
understand what it's for and who might
or might not be interested in it so stay
tuned
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise show you
the link in the video description down
below to learn more
alright first off starting off with the
hardware
it doesn't feel fantastically premium
especially compared to the Xbox elite
controller that I recently reviewed here
but it doesn't feel that horrible either
and it comes at a pretty damn fair price
for a controller 50 bucks the USD at
least this puts it below the cost of
most other first party controllers in
terms of physical layout you have two
paddles on the back shoulder buttons
triggers a B X&amp;amp;Y buttons in a really
weird position a thumb stick just to the
left of middle and down a bit left and
right arrow buttons which are
essentially just start and select a
steam home button and the main event the
dual opposing touch pads with haptic
feedback haptic feedback on here is
basically when you move your finger
across the touchpad it will vibrate ever
so slightly just so that you know that
the input is going through it's actually
very satisfactory on the bottom there's
a switch that releases the dual paddles
and reveals the batteries if you don't
want to use the wireless dongle either
directly plugged in or through an
extension and on the front there's a
micro USB plug just in case you like
wired so the haptic feedback actually
felt really good I totally knew what was
happening under my fingers while they
were on touch pads which is actually a
huge relief when I first saw this
controller I was very worried about that
that being said none of the other inputs
amazed me in terms of their feel they
still made me feel very in control which
is actually more than what I was
expecting when I saw the price tag and
even when I picked it up for the first
time it felt kind of cheap so what is it
actually good for well I think of it as
an enabler which is why I don't really
want to compare it much to other
controllers personally I will always
prefer a standard controller for driving
games or like a racing wheel or
something and a keyboard and mouse for
things like shooters for anyone who
isn't deluded these are widely accepted
strengths to these input methods and I
don't expect the steam controller is
going to change anyone's mind about this
actually I would go as far as to say
that the steam controller should pretty
much never
or be used when seated at a desk because
there's always a better option but
that's just my opinion but when you're
sitting on a couch using a keyboard a
mouse either totally sucks or makes you
look like a complete doofus
yeah I know there's some options like
the couch master but honestly when I'm
couch gaming I'm gonna want a controller
so I can sit comfortably
whatever my comfortable might actually
look like which is why many games like
civilization or papers please
can't really be played in what I would
call a satisfactory way on a home
theater couch bass set up until now
playing papers please with this thing
felt entirely natural and playing save
five on the couch nice and relaxed
expanding my civilization trying to hold
off barbarians and whatnot that felt
like home I wouldn't use this for every
game and those were easy examples but it
does enable games that wouldn't really
normally be a thing for couch gaming
controller users the controls seem to be
endlessly customizable with people
online even doing autohotkey setups in
order to control their tests all better
which is pretty cool
many reviews that i've read leading up
to this one have proclaimed that there
is a steep and scary learning curve I'm
going to go out on a limb here and
completely disagree in my opinion if
you've ever used a laptop with a
touchpad you should be able to get
pretty familiar with this guy pretty
quick sure if you're going to play
something like a shooter on it it's
gonna take some time to get proficient
with it but I don't really think that's
what it's actually designed for anyways
although your mileage may vary I
personally didn't enjoy the
over-the-shoulder games like Mass Effect
with the steam controller but I've read
rave reviews online about how it's great
for this style of gaming so the none of
this addresses the people who don't want
to customise their controllers however
which doesn't mean tinkering is the only
way to enjoy steam controller in fact in
many cases not tinkering at all may be a
better route steam will warn you when a
game may not work very well with the
default profile and suggest that you
customize things at this point you'll
probably utilize the sometimes awesome
hive mind power that is the steam
community you can see community
submitted controller configs and even
see how many people are using which one
every single time I needed a config I
just use the most commonly used
community config and it worked
splendidly no reason for me to fight
with things when somebody else has
already done the heavy lifting I'd love
to see valve improve this functionality
by allowing the profile creators to
upload short videos demonstrating how to
use their profiles most effectively so
all good then I should rush out and buy
it no not necessarily
I have some concerns about making a
sweeping recommendation that you should
buy one your grandma should buy one and
your dog should buy one the cost is
cheap but it feels pretty cheap which is
a little disappointing not to mention
damn Gabe why is there glossy plastic on
the top what what is this what purpose
does this serve it looks like crap in
like three seconds God anyways and aside
from those minor quibbles this is my
biggest problem
it doesn't really have a home at the
desk and unless you're one of those six
people who bought a steam machine or
happen to have a home theater PC
how much time are you going to spend
couch gaming on the specific titles that
will actually benefit from this I
actually don't know for me at least with
the hours of civ 5 on the couch I see in
my future this is a $50 pill that I can
swallow so if that interests you at all
then check it out and I guess the real
bottom line here is that while my
initial impressions were why did they
try to reinvent the wheel it's just
weird
after spending more time getting to know
it and in the appropriate context of not
forcing myself to use it as a
replacement for my existing controller
or keyboard mouse but rather an entirely
new beast I'm glad that they did I fix
it is your complete DIY electronics
repair solution from there 15 thousand
free step-by-step repair guides to their
huge inventory of replacement parts and
tools with lifetime warranties I fix it

today they want to introduce you to

after 64 bit driver kit over their
previous 54 bit driver kit with a swivel
