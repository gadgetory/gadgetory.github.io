build was finished and I have expected
it to come a lot sooner than then it
actually has so here's the tour of the
build now that it's finally done I guess
not a whole lots changed since the last
time so I got my dual 120 rad in the
front got my blu-ray drive got my SSD
hidden away back there here you can see
all my ghetto water cooling that's all
hiding in the basement power supply most
of the business stuff is over here so
980 x6 core got 12 gigs of OCC DDR 3 mm
ram then I've also got GTX 480 single
card with the ek full cover block which
I recently did a guide on how to install
which was a time consuming and I made a
lot more mistakes when I'm trying to a
video record something like that versus
just doing it and focusing on what I'm
doing which is what I would recommend
that you guys do enter max revolution
1050 watt power supply right now I'm
using onboard audio going out to an
audio receiver but from Onkyo and then
that goes out to my calf speaker so
there's no need for a high-end sound
card although if I do change my setup to
some community tour speakers which I
might do and I'll have to get a sound
card I have a killer Nick in there right
now though I'm not using it currently I
got my quadruple thermal chill rad down
here on the bottom with Silverstone air
penetrator fans the rest of the fans in
my machine are gelid wing and I think
I'm using wings in the front
yeah I'm using wings in the front these
days gilad wings are great for under
whole ting all of these fans are on
their own and cube key balancer which is
behind the motherboard tray so you can
see that most of them are actually even
off right now these are hardly spinning
and the bottom radiator ones are hardly
spinning these are off so if the room
wasn't so cold or if the system was
actually doing something they'd ramp up
and actually turn on for the ones that
aren't on I think that's pretty much it
the system's not nearly as impressive in
the light so I'm going to go ahead and
start turning off lights so we can
see all the lighting effects that I do
work so hard at making sure that they
look all cool so it's pretty hard to
that's pretty hard to see it looks
better in person but what are you gonna
do or maybe if I turn on sort of like
one light sort of pointed somewhere else
then we'll be able to get a better
effect yeah there we go now you can kind
of see it a bit better that's more like
what it looks like so I got the glowing
cables got my glowing tubes got my
glowing fans everything's UV so I have
these purple lights when I actually put
the side panel on those lights are
hidden so you can't see them so all you
see is the glowing effect and there you
go so that is my system it's done for
now always changes it's never really
done thanks for checking out my video
