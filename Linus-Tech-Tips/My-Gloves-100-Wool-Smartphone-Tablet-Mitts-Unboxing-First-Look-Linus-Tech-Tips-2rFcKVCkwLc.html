one that the my gloves here and hem my
gloves get your own keep your hands warm
while using your touchscreen or mobile
products so here's a scenario you guys
have probably encountered if you live in
Canada here with me where it's cold and
stuff and that is that you're outside
and you got you're just trying to remove
this plastic thing here okay you got
your winter gloves on they look a little
something like this maybe they have like
little skeletons on the back or maybe
they don't these particular gloves are
actually available in a variety of
different styles and you're outside
you're like oh it's cold and waiting up
the bus i got my sleeves down like this
and your phone rings and you're like oh
yeah i'll just answer my phone no
problem iphone has buttons oh wait no it
doesn't because my phone is a smartphone
so there are no buttons at all and
you're like oh come on please please
PLEASE this time work please well these
gloves actually are pretty cool they're
available in three different sizes so
there's out here I'll just show you guys
what it says on the packaging so there's
small which is for four to six inches
and that's from the tip of your finger
to the bottom of your palm medium which
is for six to eight and a half inches so
I have pretty small hems for an adult
and the mediums are the ones that fit me
so these are definitely child size and
then large is eight and a half inches
plus so basically what these do is they
have silver threads embedded in the
middle finger the index finger and the
thumb of both hands so you can see the
positioning of the thumb is oriented so
that while you can't pinch on a page
like this you will be able to you know
slide and answer your phone you'll be
able to use your thumb this way but not
this way so what those do is they
actually um allow you to use your
smartphone or tablet with these gloves
now they're not accurate enough that
you're going to be texting you know at
the same rate that you would normally
text but you can enter your password you
can check you know your stocks scroll up
and down you can go ahead and you can
you know check the bank ooh
verkan ox app and then with a reasonable
degree of accuracy you can actually here
i have my ftp information on there so
i'm just gonna make a new note for
myself here let's see if we can type i
haven't actually tried to type okay
hello i am whoops yeah so we're not
quite we're not quite there for like
typing but it's not really the intention
i mean we're talking to the guys who
designed the product and the intention
was you can at least answer your phone
and not take your gloves off but no i
mean you can if you're willing to sort
of work at it a little bit i'm running
late so you could send a basic message
without too much difficulty using these
so the silver pink fingertips are built
into the thumb and the first two fingers
not these ones most people probably
aren't using their phone with their you
know ring finger anyway so it doesn't
seem to be too much of a factor but i
think that's pretty much it so pricing
chart of ranges from like 30 bucks to I
think 50 bucks depending on whether you
get them without a designer with the
design they are a hundred percent wool
which okay except for the little bits in
the fingertips and they are not machine
washable it is suggested that you only
hand wash them because they are made of
100-percent wool and quite honestly I'm
gonna have to take them off pretty quick
here because they are certainly too warm
for me to be standing around in my house
using them so they work with the iPad as
well obviously I mean if they work with
the with with the touch screen then they
they kind of work with a touch screen so
yeah it makes it so you can actually use
your your iPad or your iPhone or your
other smartphone without too much
difficulty here very cool oh yeah I
don't forget to subscribe fly detectives
from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
