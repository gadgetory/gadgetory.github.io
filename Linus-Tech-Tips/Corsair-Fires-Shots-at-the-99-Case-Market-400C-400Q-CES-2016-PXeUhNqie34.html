2016 we have got a couple of case
products to show you guys starting with
the carbide clear 400 C in the c is for
corsair no it's not it's for clear huge
thanks to Squarespace for sending Lynas
media group to CES 2016 check out the
link in the video description to learn
more about Squarespace so what they've
done here is they've basically taken the
concept of an optical drive this
computer case which is not the first
time we've seen it but they've gone and
they've tried to find what they think is
a better balance in terms of features
and size than what's already on the
market so the 400 C allows a full ATX
motherboard it's got their what I
personally think is just stunning we
first saw it on the 760 T they're
they're full glass door with the
removable hinge style thing on the side
here and then they've allowed you to
effectively gem an incredible amount of
hardware in here so the power supply is
covered by a nice by the way removable
shroud and then there's another shroud
piece here that can also be removed if
you want to cover up your cable
management so you can see the way that
they've got it done here makes it look
really clean or you can take it out if
you want to be able to pop in a triple
120 millimeter radiator in the front to
go along with that you can put another
dual 120 millimeter radiator in the top
for a total of five 120 millimeter rads
and what is a mid tower case in fact if
you're going custom liquid cooling it's
possible no I think we'd have
interference on the back but still very
very impressive on the top you've got
there awesome magnetic removable fan
filter system going on here and in terms
of air flow there's basically no
restriction because while the front
panel is the sort of Corsair signature I
mean we're talking since the 800 D flat
black box besides themselves are
completely full of air vents that are
almost an inch off the front of the case
so you're going to have ample airflow in
any situation now there's actually two
versions of this case there's the C with
the C 4 Corsair and then there's
actually the 400 q the carbide quiet 400
Q where the Q
is for Corsair so really different from
the other one and the only difference is
here are that the top is now also
removable but not a fan filter because
it's supposed to be quiet you're not
supposed to fill it with fans but you
can because you can take the top off and
on the underside of this you got magnets
you can go ahead and mount that puppy on
there as well as noise deadening
material now this is unusual but the Q
and the C both actually cost exactly the
same and normally you charge extra for
the window the reason for that is that
the Q has noise deadening high density
rubber material on all of the internal
panels and that costs money just the
same as an acrylic or plexi window does
so you can see in this one they haven't
gone quite as balls-to-the-wall in terms
of all the liquid cooling radiators and
all that stuff a more modest
configuration but that's what you'd
expect the one cool thing about this is
it gives you a bit of a better look at
that cable management hole with this
bottom shroud here I don't think I can
remove this but Oh hold on oh no there's
a there's a note there's a screw in the
back so we won't pull too hard on it
which leads us Ben I guess to the last
corsair case that we're showcasing and
this is the carbide series spec alpha
personally not a fan I think the word
that they've asked me to use is
polarizing when I think what I said was
repugnant or something like that
it's got this angular front that kind of
you know towers over you menacingly
except that it's except that it's kind
of small but it does have some positive
things going for it
the aesthetic can be customized the
colors can actually be changed very
easily we've got two versions of it over
here so there's like a red and white
there's a black and gray there's also
going to be a black and yellow and then
any number of other colors if a system
integrator or whoever else wants it it's
got built-in fan control and it's got
you know the usual things you'd expect
from Corsair so the mesh front for good
airflow the side window for you know
nice tall CPU coolers if you're into
that sort of thing or you know liquid
cooling compatibility if you're into
that sort of thing let me know in the
comments am I totally wrong is this the
new black I do genuinely want to hear
from you guys I mean surely someone
likes it apparently this is a big hit
from the Latin American and the Chinese
resellers they're like
super stoked on this so I want to hear
from you guys so thanks for checking out
our first video here from the Corsair
suite on the 400 C 400 q remember the C
and Q are both for Corsair as well as
the spec alpha I believe this thing goes
by thanks for checking us out and a huge
