2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we're here at qnap
to check out there turbo nass SS 469 pro
name is little bit complicated but the
hardware specs are not it has an intel
atom two point three gigahertz dual-core
processor 1 gig of ram expandable up to
3 gigs that's pretty cool you can have
512 megabytes of flash memory it has for
HIV / STD slots that's 2.5 inch some USB
stuff other stuff that's not that big of
a deal i'm going to show you the actual
physical thing here right now you've got
some pretty nice hot swappable base I
can get it out here he just did it for
me there we go pretty nice hot song who
lays where you can mount your drives in
there shove them in you got four bays
fairly simple looking unit but it looks
nice and professional but what actually
Wow me is because I wouldn't normally be
that excited about an ass but this one
actually has a web control panel so you
can access all of your files away from
home if you're one of those kind of
people that don't really like having all
your files on say Dropbox or Google Docs
or something like that because you don't
like them being out there and controlled
by someone else you can actually run
your own cloud server so it's all your
own stuff there's tons of different
options in here you can have all your
photos music videos all that kind of
stuff easily accessible and easily
sorted you can actually pick which
folders push into these easily
selectable icons in their settings you
can set up exactly how you want it to be
set up through your router or soon it's
currently in beta but very soon they'll
have a way that it sets itself up for
you so you don't even have to touch your
router at all which would be very nice
once that's set up you can share files
music video video music video pictures
whatever you want you can have them
publicly shareable through a link or you
can send them directly through an email
to people that you want so it's just
basically gives you all the options that
everything that you might currently be
using say Dropbox or Google Docs or
Google Drive or SkyDrive or whatever
there's a billion of them but it's all
manageable by yourself you have a backup
for you you can set up group files
there's different apps you can download
for it it's crazy you can have stuff in
code currently while you're using it so
basically this resource monitor down
here which I find awesome because I'm a
hardware guy will show you exactly how
much it's currently
using its not doing much right now so
the CPU is very low and the Rams very
low but earlier we are encoding and it
just max the CPU out through ram through
the roof and actually encoded a video on
the fly while we were doing other things
within the station and it didn't lag it
out so that was great it's you can code
anything to work on anything so like the
guy was helping me out was saying you
can have it run an iPhone video when you
had it actually for massive format you
tune it down get lower resolution rates
and have it run in something else if
he's like and one second here I'm just
going to jump into the control panel if
you were worried about this being locked
down and not being able to use it that
great jump into the control panel and
there's every option you could pretty
much ever want you can have you can have
things delete easily you can add your
own security setup so you can have the
eco power running you can run firmware
updates like I don't even there's way
too many options here to cover in a
quick video like this but it's got
pretty much everything you could want
which is awesome I personally find this
kind of stuff very cool because i don't
like hosting myself out in the cloud
like i was saying earlier I like having
control of all my own files I like being
able to back up my own ass I like being
able to back up on my own stuff I like
having my own hard drives I don't know
it's just my kind of a thing just jump
me back to the resource monitor real
quick if we actually click on the name
resource monitor it's going to take a
second to load up here and then it'll
come up you can get way more in-depth
statistics here we go it's going to take
a second to populate this actually don't
know if it will because I believe this
is in beta but I'll take a second
populate this but it can show you your
usage graphs so CPU usage over the next
little while memory usage we're going to
jump in here there we go that one's
actually populating so memory usage you
can see how much it's currently using
how much is free basically you can
figure out okay maybe I need to buy a
bigger qnap system because I'm
constantly encoding things and
constantly converting things or this
one's great for you because you're not
converting things all the time just
every once in a while and you just need
for two and a half inch Bay's this thing
is pretty cool I've seen a couple like
them but the user interface on this is
very very streamlined and very very nice
so thanks for checking out our qnap
booth we're going to move on hey guys
still the qnap booths just wanted to
cover this before I left just in case
you were worried about connectivity
within your home you can connect it
through DLNA hdmi or airplay one thing
that he showed me was through HDMI you
can very easily set up xbox media player
as we show up here
xbox media player is awesome for home
theater setups so if you have this guy
knew your TV you can have all your media
on it right there and very very easily
stream to xbox media player and still
take the advantage of the accessible
through the web platform that we showed
you earlier thanks for watching our qnap
