crazy Russian wants me to say about the
system at this time but this is the vest
of 50/50 and he has turned on the camera
and I'm here to talk about it so inside
the system we've actually got and he's
gone and he's fasten the screw on the
side panels and I'm gonna have to remove
it we've got our just cause to benchmark
running this is absolutely maxed out
completely maxed out at 1080p anti
aliasing anisotropic filtering
everything you can see right down here
the frames per second is right around
the 60fps mark in the just cause to
benchmark that's running right now so
I'm going to show you guys the config
that we've got going on here actually
here's something I want to show you also
about this particular system and that is
the integrated fan control so you can
see the labeled fan speed controller
here the ones what the blue lights on
are the ones that are active and the
blue light only goes on if there are
fans plugged in so move the camera close
to these fans and I'm going to use the
fan control to turn them up I do the
wrong one
oh I turn the wrong one there it is
there so you can hear they're louder now
and that was just from from using the
integrated fan speed controller to get
some more cooling potential thrown at
basically the hard drive cage area and
then any air you draw in here is also
going to be usable by the video card as
well so speaking of the video card
inside the config we've actually got the
6970 option whereas this system is also
available at the exact same price with
the gtx 570 so basically you get to pick
whether you want a red or a green card
and the performance in many games is
actually fairly similar between these
two cards so basically it comes down to
what features are more important to you
do you want I finna D that is triple or
more displays off of a single card or do
you care more about having 3d vision and
physics with the nvidia side of things
it's totally your personal preference so
this uses the asou saber-tooth x58
motherboard much can enhance
triple-channel Ram that is 12 gigs of
ram we've got an eco alc liquid cooling
unit from kulit as well as a C Sonic 80
plus bronze power supply we've also got
an OC Z SSD for the boot drive as well
as a WD storage drive for wall storage
so our benchmark is finished running
here we can see we averaged 63 frames
per second at the settings that the
crazy Russian is about to scroll down so
you can see them anyway this system is
going to be $14.99 on the NCIX site so
feel free to check back there soon if
you want to get your hands on one of
these killer gaming machines and don't
forget it is compatible with both SLI
and crossfire so you can run any
graphics configuration pretty much that
you could want in the vesta 50/50 don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
