cream of the cream for 89 dfx
motherboards so this is their highest
end AMD motherboard for the moment that
means that it has support for amd's
fenham 2 X 6 X 4 or really anything else
that fits in an am3 socket should you so
desire you as I said before it uses the
890 FX chip set so that means you've got
support for crossfire X up to four way
so actually why don't we go through all
of gigabytes interesting technologies
they've got outlined on the front this
is a new thing on off charge that means
that there are certain USB ports on the
board that will actually support
charging attached USB devices in this
case they've got an iPhone attached to
it even when the computer is off and one
of the reasons they're able to do that
is due to their three three three octets
technology which is USB power 3 X so
they've really updated the way that they
deliver power to the USB ports they
deliver three times the specified power
capability I mean you're not going to be
over juicing all of your components but
it can provide up to three times the
amount of power even while the system's
off very cool you've also got support
for USB 3 as well as say 23 as part of
their 333 thing you also have a three
year warranty they should call it like
3333 in canada and ultra durable 3 it
should be like five threes how about how
many more three things can we do okay I
don't see much else they've got auto
unlock so that means that you can do
core unlocking on this motherboard which
I have covered a couple of times in the
past how to do that before wit crossfire
say 236 gig up right it has southbridge
850 so that means you've got six say two
three ports so that is supported
natively by AMD's chipset gigabyte
actually did not have to add a third
party chipset to this particular
motherboard like they have two on the
intel boards so over here we've got some
more outlines of the mostly the same
features but here's a different one
silent hybrid silent type 2 so this is a
little liked our heats blush and say
little it's a huge tower heat same thing
that you strap to the north bridge in
order to get better cooling in my
experience with the old x58 extreme it
wasn't necessary but it did provide
better cooling to the Northbridge as
well as the MOSFETs because it's all
connected by heat
on the back I don't see okay on board
quick switch so you've got onboard
switches you've got an onboard debug LED
dual LAN ports and that pretty much
covers everything that I see on the back
here okay cool so let's get this opened
up go bucks I love gigabytes high-end
bosses they just like they're a little
bit busy you know but they cover
everything so well it makes my life
easier I don't think I've ever said what
the board is called it's the 890 FX aud
7 so you d7 puts it right up in the top
tier of gigabyte motherboards all right
let's get this open so I'm gonna take
the board away from your interested eyes
first here and then we'll have a look at
the accessories that are included first
so okay I haven't seen gigabyte do an
accessory box like this before this is
gonna be so you pull it apart like this
and then you can see what is inside so
we have a user's mail we have sticker
there's a powered by gigabyte sticker
okay then we have a user's manual as
well as a driver and utilities DVD so
you should download the latest off the
site don't use this DVD and then in here
this is a fully in English so it's
covers everything from BIOS
configuration to probably even
installing drivers and some basic
troubleshooting all that good stuff
where to plug in all of your front
headers I think I missed one here here
is the multilingual installation guide
book so this covers the physical
installation and is in a variety of
different languages and inside there i
also found the Dolby Home Theater
sticker very nice okay in the other side
of this pack here I have more stuff so
first I have a crossfire bridge across
space fire okay that's very interesting
and the top is unlabeled and then I have
another crossfire bridge right okay I
guess you could potentially need a
couple of bridges if you're going to be
configuring quad crossfire okay next we
have
some say two cables ooh these are nice
actually gigabytes moving away while
partially from their yellow SATA cables
to something that actually matches the
motherboard go figure beautiful i love
it too straight and to right angle and
then we've also got an IDE cable
included next we have there ESAT a
bracket I really like these things it's
a very convenient way to just add more
East SATA cables or at add more you SATA
ports to your computer and then there's
also a little power thing as well as an
external power adapter so this is one
molex to SATA power so with this bracket
and this cable you can plug in to
external hard drives very cool and they
also include to e SATA cables for you as
well this is a far more complete kit
than they used to include next we've got
an i/o shield which handily labels all
of the interesting stuff on the back so
that's okay we'll cover that more later
ok let's get this motherboard opened up
here okay got a little plastic thing on
top then you have the hybrid pipe chew
let me see if I can get this open yeah
you can probably see it pretty good
anyway so here's what you do you shake
it so there's thermal compound included
as well as four screws and so see these
four holes right here those are going to
strap on to the Northbridge right about
where that water block is located right
now so gigabyte gives you the option and
it comes with the water block installed
by default of either this is why it's
called hybrid using this big Tower heat
pipe cooler thing which actually mounts
to a pci bracket at the back okay so
then it mounts on to here and then goes
all the way to the back of the
motherboard like this looks like that
okay or you can leave the default water
cooling solution on which is an all
copper affair so you don't have to worry
about it gunking up your your your water
loop if you have to you know click on
any other blocks up to it and then I
don't know where I was going with that
it has included water cooling okay
three-eighths inch Barb's so it'll be
compatible with most high-end water
cooling systems as long as you're not
using overkill half-inch Barb's here's a
little USB 3 sticker okay let's have a
look at the layout of the board in the
center we find in its ideal location the
am3 socket so
goodbye an am3 bracket this board uses
eight plus two phase power as I recall
but I can double-check that before I
wrap up the video if I remember in the
top left corner we've got our eight pin
power in its ideal location we've got
cpu fan this board does not use for pin
power fan connectors all over so that's
the feature that's pretty cool but not
included on this one we've got two dual
channel sets of ddr3 memory support so
that's going to support up to 16 gigs of
ram with current four gig dims then we
have onboard power and reset switches
this is a breath of fresh air that is
the right place for an onboard switch
because when you've got four graphics
cards installed which you know if you
have a lot of money you would most of
the onboard switches are down here you
got a graphics card here how you gonna
access it no this is perfect because
here you're plugging in the 24 kicked in
connector there won't be anything else
around there very nice then we've got an
IDE cable floppy cable connector then
down moving a little bit further we've
got a clear CMOS which covered by a
little protective plastic cover this is
also a much better location for this
than I've seen many times in the past
while it's not quite as good as the back
panel it's way better than having like
you know some stupid little jumper
hidden like here which I've seen many
many many times okay next we've got our
SATA ports so this is say 22 right here
we've got to say to two ports so you can
use those for your optical drives or
anything right you don't care how fast
they go and then you've got six say 236
gigabit per second ports very nice
here's our onboard debug LED and yeah
someone was knocking on the door but I
think they figured out that I'm shooting
a video right now here's our front panel
connectors as well as our front USB one
two three we've got three front headers
for USB then we have one front header
for firewire and one for poem okay all
right pci express configuration this is
where it starts to get interesting you
see all these little chips in here those
are going to be splitting apart the pci
express lanes provided with this chipset
so if you want to run to 16x cards at 16
x speed you're going to be using this
top port and then this one down here so
if you're running dual crossfire you're
going to cover up these two and these
two so
we'll leave you a pci-express 8 export a
PCI Express for export as well as a PCI
Express eight export okay so just just
to be clear if you're running for you're
going to cover this one again here so
you'll be running in 16 x 8 x 16 x + 8 x
and it's quite possible then it's going
to split it eight eight eight eight but
i'm not actually a hundred percent sure
either way as long as you're running a
tex are above you are not going to run
into any performance disadvantages so
let's just have a quick look at the
cooling solution on the Southbridge I
mean that's a pretty weak cooler but it
looks really neat and since that self
bridge doesn't kick off a whole lot of
heat it totally doesn't matter I like it
then we've got our northbridge cooling
solution here which I've talked about
enough I think and then our MOSFET
cooler so that cools the one two three
four five six seven eight plus two phase
power design on this motherboard now
let's have a quick look at our i/o
shield at the back so USB 2.0 ports
we've got one two three four five six
seven eight now these are those USB 2.0
/ e SATA ports so we've actually got to
e SATA ports on the back and then they
include that bracket you can have up to
four SATA ports on this board very cool
we have a ps2 mouse keyboard combo port
digital audio out in both optical and
coaxial flavors firewire another
firewire two gigabit ethernet USB 3.0 as
well as 7.1 audio now I wish they
labeled which USB ports can be used for
charging but I guess we'll go ahead and
assume that at least some of them can
and too bad for me thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the 890 fxa
ud7 from gigabyte</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
