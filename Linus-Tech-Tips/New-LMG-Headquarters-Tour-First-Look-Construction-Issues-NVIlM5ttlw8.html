actually shown where the new linus media
group headquarters is going to be let's
take a look inside shall we
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilizing
the nvme standard provides speeds never
before seen on consumer storage drives
click my hair to learn more first of all
that's the bathroom so I found out that
plumbing super expensive so we've gone
with a much more economical solution
right by the front door that way our
visitors can use it our staff can step
outside get some fresh air momentarily
before they experience that air and use
that great strategy right no one what
you clean a porta potti you just drag it
out into the rest of the complex and
someone else will deal with it I don't
know where the key is I hope I have the
key are there people in there like are
they working maybe we can get in some
other way yeah so I forgot the front
door blocks actually don't work so we
have to go around the back this is
really cool so Brandon had a veritable
nerdgasm when he saw this place because
this is only I don't know 30 paces from
our back door it looks like it's going
to have some kind of a water feature or
something here so this is going to be
like b-roll central between all the
greenery back here that in theory is
going to be landscaped at some point and
this you know brick / gravel / whatever
concrete fixtures they're planning to
put in there should be really cool like
just a really neat place to film alright
so there it is I actually haven't set
foot in here since um since what
happened since they sprayed it so I
haven't actually seen the skeleton of
what will be the office yet why don't I
turn on the lights and then we'll we'll
go from there
still kind of stinks in here not nearly
as bad as it was right when they
finished spraying so you have got to be
kidding me
who does something like this
okay well one of the things I'm supposed
to do while I'm here is see if this has
dried yet it does seem to be a little
bit maybe a little bit down it seems
mostly dry actually so we had a big
problems the dampness in the cellulose
spray on material here caused it to be
extremely humid in here which caused the
wood framing for some of our sets to
warp so these have been torn down and
actually need to be rebuilt
so actually since since you've got a
wider view of the place right now sets
are pretty much going to be set up
around the perimeter so we're going to
have a lot more variety in terms of what
we can do for sets and I'm speaking up
to talk to the camera but I'm actually
lab so I don't have to do that and then
the office itself is actually going to
be that entire corner over over there so
we have we have a pretty a pretty good
plan in place so far storage is going to
be kind of this middle area here this
corner right over here is going to be
like a workshop II type set this corner
right here is going to be the land show
right here is going to be to be
determined right here on the other side
of these doors is going to be a massive
green screen something you guys probably
don't know is that when I'm talking in
front of the green screen now I have to
keep my arms within like I have to kind
of have t-rex arms because if I put them
out too far my hands get chopped off
because I'm at the edge of our green
screen so we're going to have a
ginormous green screen that goes all the
way down to my feet so we could do all
kinds of fun stuff with that I think
it's going to be 12 feet high at least
10 I think it's 10 or 12 feet high and
then it's actually there used to be
markings on the floor but it's from here
to a boat I want to say here yeah its
massive it's going to be friggin awesome
over here is Brandon's b-roll set and
then over here is sort of to be to be
determined I can't believe they're
leaning stuff up against this wall so
Ed's filming and he keeps whining of
how it smells bad and it's humid in here
so I guess we'll open up one of the bay
doors so these will use for you know
whenever we get a palletized shipment of
something which has only happened once
ever so probably we won't use these a
whole lot but there you go we have bay
doors in case we ever happen to need the
fresh air that's what we want them for
definitely helps with the air situation
yeah Tess all right so why don't we do a
quick tour of the actual office space
then this is the server room she don't
look like much but had some servers yeah
I know I was the room well they're both
coming this right here is the editing
den so you can see that's why there is
so much electrical and networking coming
into this place so we've got all of
these conduits for wiring we've got lots
of electrical boxes so it's going to be
set up to have three workstations per
side and then easy access to filming
outside in the warehouse so there's
going to be another wall like kind of
here hashanah say rude yeah must be
I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna guess
here
so here ish that's going to be the
editing den on that side I guess yeah
let's let's go right over here so here
is going to be the benchmarking area so
this is going to be Luke and someone
else is sort of placed to hang out in
benchmark stuff it's going to have some
storage area there's a storage closet
kind of somewhere over here yeah this
must be it so there's a storage closet
under the stairs the bathroom I believe
is I want to say I don't know where the
bathroom went well the bathroom will be
somewhere presumably maybe this is the
bathroom it's kind of a weird layout but
I didn't know that it was a weird layout
I think it was sort of an error in the
plans that had caused that to happen
maybe this is the storage closet at any
rate this over here is going to be the
library so the library is just going to
be kind of a quiet place to work for
people who want to sit and work quietly
without being interrupted by others oh
look network wiring husband run I had
asked for cat6a let's see if they
managed to do that it's thick I'll get
on that
oh no wait no that's power never mind it
was round so I thought maybe through it
all right so let's head upstairs
Wow the air actually has a thickness to
it Wow
there is way less echo up here that's
interesting
hello hello ha
fascinating well up here I think this
this right here is the bathroom
upstairs and then the rest of the
upstairs is TBD because we have no idea
what's going to go up here what we do
know for now is that you will be able to
access wow this is kind of eerie when
there's a handrail on this this will
feel a lot safer and there will be but
you'll have easy access to the warehouse
from here through a hallway and then
you'll have access to the office from
there and the rest of it is completely
up in the air we have no idea what we're
going to put up here so I think that's
pretty much it
welcome to the new and improved linus
