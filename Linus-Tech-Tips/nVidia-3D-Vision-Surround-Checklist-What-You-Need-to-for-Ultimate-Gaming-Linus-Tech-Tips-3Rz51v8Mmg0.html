video blog where i will be doing some of
the initial setup of the pretty much
ultimate gaming experience you can
possibly have these days so the first
thing i'll draw your attention to is the
three acer 120 hertz twenty-three point
six inch 3d ready LCD monitors these are
fully HD ready they are two millisecond
response time they support hdmi as well
as DVI and between the three of them are
enough screen real estate to choke a
horse next we have two gtx 480 s one of
which is provided by zotac and the other
one of which is provided by msi so these
are going to be what actually powers
these beasts remember this is going to
be 3 times HD resolution that needs to
be driven by these two video cards so
that's why I need a whole lot of
horsepower next we have the nvidia 3d
vision glasses as well as the ir
transmitter so those are the six pieces
that you will need in order to set up a
surround 3d vision gaming setup so if
you do not want to do 3d vision you
still need two cards and three monitors
so at that point you might as well spend
the extra couple bucks grab some 3d
vision glasses and enjoy this the way it
is meant to be enjoyed here's my test
platform that I'll be using to run this
entire gaming setup so it's got a core
i7 875 k unlocked CPU I've got four gigs
of kingston hyperx blue ram over there
i'm going to be installing obviously
those video cards into here I've got an
antec truepower Quattro 1200 watt and
ocz vertex SSD and then I've also got I
actually don't remember what drive it is
but I have some DVD drive so that pretty
much covers what I'll be using for my
test platform I'm all decked out with my
steelseries professional gaming gear
here and I will definitely be updating
you with some more unboxing some more
first-hand experience with this pretty
much the best gaming
experience money can buy there it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
