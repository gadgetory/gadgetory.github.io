project owl who were the winners of the
2018 call for code and they're pulling
back the kimono to show us their Ducks
so Ducks are small transmitters that
allow a huge Wi-Fi mesh network to be
deployed quickly and easily now they're
not the kind of thing that you would use
in your house but they can be invaluable
during a disaster when cell service or
other essential communications
infrastructure might be down so let's
take a look at how they work while also
giving a big thanks to call for code
founding partner IBM for sponsoring this
video
project Dowell started as a submission
to call for code last year and call for
code is a global challenge inspiring
developers to create sustainable
technologies to help communities prepare
for and respond to natural disasters so
the team was actually inspired by the
floods caused by a hurricane in Houston
and the idea was to create a Wi-Fi
network that could be distributed by
what is essentially a bunch of rubber
ducks so when the flood comes in a fleet
of these ducks could just be dropped
into the water and they would just float
around and allow users to connect to an
emergency Wi-Fi network now to be clear
the goal was never you know like look
out AT&amp;amp;T cuz we've got this amazing fast
Wi-Fi like it doesn't even give you an
internet connection but what it does do
is allow people to connect with an
emergency response center and share
crucial information like their location
if anyone needs medical attention and so
on and so forth so let's look at how
they got this to work this right here is
a duck it's a shockingly simple device
we've got an Arduino dev board that's
equipped with a Wi-Fi chip a lower chip
and an antenna this is the actual
housing that they won't look like this
and the way that these work is that in
every deployment there's one main duck
that acts as the primary connection
point so that'll maybe be located in an
emergency response shelter or at a
hospital then from there the satellite
ducks can be spread out around to send
messages or relay them back to the main
duck so the user would connect to the
Wi-Fi on the nearest duck to their
location and then their messages would
be sent over Laura which is a long range
low powered transmission standard that
allows the satellite ducks to maintain
their connection from distances that are
much further than traditional Wi-Fi
thing is though even with Laura you
can't get too far away from the main
duck and this is where another really
cool thing about project owl comes in so
a bunch of these satellite ducks can
actually connect together to form a
cluster duck creating a kind of mesh
Wi-Fi network so if each duck has a
range of about 400 meters the distance
they can cover adds up really fast
a dozen might cover a small community
and as you get more that area just keeps
on increasing so why don't we try it out
Charlie here is part of project owl so
he's gonna turn on the main duck which
we have over at the end here so just
open it up and click it on and I'm gonna
turn on one of our satellite ducks so I
click this it says mama online and then
each of these is run off a battery pack
that's super simple it's just three
double a's that will power it for up to
12 hours and in the future they figure
these could be powered completely off of
solar energy all right so we should be
in business let's see just how well this
is going to work in an emergency I fire
up my Wi-Fi here got my screen recording
running we go ahead and see SOS mama
emergency portal I think if I saw that
in an emergency I would probably connect
to it and boom owl emergency network on
Espanyol you're connected to the owl
emergency networks sending an SOS
message we'll send your GPS location to
first responders and emergency message
you can add details about your emergency
and the closest facilities to you are
located at Willowbrook shopping center
where'd you get that from if you guys
just pick something
okay that is a nearby mall indeed and
perhaps a place you know they've got a
big parking lot that could be set up
with tree edge of sorts so I can go
ahead I can add some details first name
where are you what's your emergency
flood landslide trapped building
collapse and violence
really bad we need first aid food
evacuation financial aid hygiene for
sure all kinds of good stuff in here we
go ahead and send our SOS and we can
send updates as well
pretty cool stuff of course though this
is Linus tech tips and a simple little
demo like that here in the studio is not
going to be enough for us we supposedly
have enough satellite ducks to cover a
small community so let's do it shall we
so for our hypothetical example here
some kind of emergency has taken place
let's say a flood and we have fled to
high ground actually it's not even that
unrealistic fun fact our office is
located right adjacent to an enormous
flood plain so the more you know so
basically we're up here we're panicked
we're scared and we have no connectivity
whatsoever either because it's been
taken out or because everybody's
spamming it at once and signals are not
going through so this right here is our
main duct and it's connected to the
Wi-Fi right here and this is sort of our
base of operations for the afternoon so
in order to cover as much area as
possible we've got one of our satellite
ducks right here that is going to go up
and hopefully not be obstructed by any
buildings or stuff so let it go
yep oh that really wants to go
ah
I'm just gonna pop a couple more around
the neighborhood to get nice coverage of
everywhere so on mama online and now
let's just put it like right there I
guess perfect
Hey
all right so I've got a bunch of them
around the neighborhood has anything
popped up yet oh look right there
oh damn it Linus survived the hell does
he want hello
oh no way burger fries man you're a
lifesaver
there's no ketchup in here now although
our example had a bit of silliness to it
this is a very serious solution to a
very real problem and our demo did show
how easy it is to create a nice big
network to bring connectivity to those
who might have lost it so thanks to
support from IBM project owl has
actually been able to expand this and
even do a field test in Puerto Rico so
if a disaster like hurricane Maria
happened again they would be able to get
connectivity quickly back to the island
and there are lots of other potential
uses like setting up basic networks in
places that currently have no cell
service whatsoever or even just using
the lower tracking of the ducts to help
find disaster relief supplies once all
is said and done it is shockingly common
for things like tents and shelters or
even portable toilets to get put down
amidst the hubbub and then kind of
forgotten where exactly they are so none
of this would have been possible for
project owl
without the boost that they got from
call for code so here's the thing guys
if you have an idea that you think could
help communities prepare for respond to
and recover from natural disasters then
submit your solution into the 2019 call
for code we're gonna have that linked
below where the top prize is $200,000
and additional support from IBM and
their partners to make your solution a
real
so thanks to IBM for sponsoring this
video thanks to project owl for coming
up here and thanks to you guys for
watching if you guys dislike this video
you can hit that button I guess but if
you liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description okay it's more of like
a community thing I don't know we
probably have community managers that
watch this channel share whatever at the
link in the video description once it's
available also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join I don't think the
fishing line is gonna break I don't know
you can just give it like another couple
hundred feet we're just tied to the park
bench sure okay it's a hurry
wait did it take off okay
ah well oops so that's gonna end up in
Chilliwack somewhere
well let's not cry over spilt milk yeah
I think we could honestly just cut that
whole thing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
