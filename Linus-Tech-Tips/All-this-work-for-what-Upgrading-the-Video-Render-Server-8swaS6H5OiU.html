right hardware for the job so we
actually learned a couple of years ago
you can check that video up here if you
want that just because you've got a
workload that traditionally scales
really well with lots of processor cores
like video encoding doesn't necessarily
mean that it will scale infinitely and
we ran into a situation we're adding
more processing course to our video
encoding server actually resulted in
significantly less performance for
spending significantly more money so we
actually found that the sweet spot was
somewhere in the eight to ten core range
with frequency actually being far more
important than core count beyond that
point fast forward a couple of years
though and the 69 50 x10 core
overclocked Extreme Edition processor
that we equipped this thing with is not
only no longer the ruler of the roost
it's actually significantly slower than
even consumer grade eight core chips
that you can buy today for a fraction of
the cost so we're gonna pull this bad
boy out
get it dust it off swap out some
hardware and see just how fast we can
make your fly uh you guys ready for me
to pull down the render server all good
sweet thanks guys speaking of all good
LTT store.com is full of all good cool
stuff like this hoodie the house still
hoodie is finally in stock go check it
out that's LTT store.com we're gonna
have that linked in the video
description
before we go any further I feel like I
should explain why we need a render
server in the first place
you might think well if you've got a
powerful workstation surely you can cut
together your video export it and upload
it to YouTube all without sending it out
to a separate server for processing and
we could do that but there are some
workflow advantages to doing things the
way that we do so whether we're shooting
on our reds or on our canon c 200s we
take whatever file type that we
originally shot we dumped it into our
premiere project and we set premiere to
use a Cinna form timeline so Cinna form
is a mezzanine codec that has great
performance on the timeline and it
retains a great deal of the image
quality from the original file it also
has some other advantages so compared to
codecs that use iframes like h.264 cinah
form is much easier to kind of chop
pieces out of without having to
completely rerender your file so
something that we can do is if we set
our timeline to sunna form render all
the files out in santa form and then
make a change like pulling a sponsor
spot out for flow plane we can very
quickly export to different versions of
that video without taking up a bunch of
time on the editors workstation allowing
them to get back to work now we could
take that finished cinah form file and
upload it directly to YouTube only
problem is it's anywhere from 30 to 60
gigabytes for the average Linus tech
tips video which even though our
internet here is really fast still takes
a long time to upload to youtube because
there are transfer speed limits on their
side so what we need to do that instead
is take our Sena form file here you can
see we're remoted into that server right
now and convert it to h.264 which will
not only upload faster on YouTube it
will also process faster and more
reliably here comes
Oh Oh
all right let's see how brutal this
thing is inside ready wow that's
actually not that bad it's almost like
dust filters are a really really good
idea so let's walk through how this
thing was configured in the first place
we've got a triple 120 millimeter fan
with some of naktu as industrial PPC
fans on it for cooling it's actually you
can't really tell but it's it's lifted
about this much off the bottom of the
server chassis so that as these fans
draw air through the front of the case
these ones suck that cool air up through
the radiator and then the warm air kind
of gets blown along this way for our
reservoir we went with a like a metal
one because I didn't want any risk of
leaking whatsoever you can see it
actually has very little evaporation -
which is really nice
a d5 pump because reliability is
absolutely the most important thing in a
build like this and raid one drives
those aren't that reliable if drives
those are ten-year-old force 120 anyway
it doesn't matter we've got 32 gigs of
RAM this was the stuff we painted
actually for a project quite a long time
ago and then I went with a gtx 980 now
normally you wouldn't need like a gaming
graphics card in something like this but
some of the workloads that it handles
are cuda accelerated and we did get a
performance improvement from that so we
chucked it in there so the only things
we're really replacing today are gonna
be the motherboard the CPU and the
memory and then I also grabbed a an RT X
xx atti to see if maybe after we upgrade
our CPU there could be some benefit from
a faster GPU so let's get started so
pretty much every aspect of this is
getting an upgrade we are dropping down
from 10 bores to a course but because
they're faster ones I'm still expecting
a performance improvement we're going
from 26 66 megahertz memory all the way
up to 32 hundred megahertz memory and
that is with lower timings to boot and
we're of course going from this older
x99 motherboard to a new z
91 so let's hope that since my last
project using this thing I had to
ultimately pull it out of my system
because of a thunderbolt snafu our our
inventory team didn't actually take the
waterblock off the motherboard because
that would be a bit of a hassle for me
to reinstall and they did oh they took
the CPU out of it too guys I guess I'm
gonna have to put the whole thing back
on again oh oh they took it apart even
more than it comes apart to start with
it is gonna take me a bit all right so
that's done let's go ahead and pop this
bad boy in here and oh yeah
this board is wider than standard ATX so
I'm going to need to move my SSDs ah
well that's some good double-sided tape
I think I bet this Drive now let's try
and put the board ease all right just
need to plug in all the fans plug in our
power and now we need to swap out our
original CPU block for this one that
cools the entire board and CPU and varan
and all that now I have a crazy idea
normally you would think well Linus the
best way to do that is probably to drain
the whole loop connect everything and
then refill it but I think we can skip
the draining step as long as we keep the
part of the loop that we open at the
highest point I'm gonna prop it up on my
graphics card
I'm just gonna crack this open I can't
find my vice grips this is not really
optimal but ah so everything that's
under me is waterproof I think tubing
fittings reservoir industrial PPC fans
there let's go ahead and undo the other
side now here's the risky part I need to
keep these two level because if one goes
too high the water will go down down
down down down and splurt up the other
side Oh hardly fun oh I think it's in
now let's see if this one reaches I
should just rename the channel to like
low effort water cooling tips forget it
I'm just gonna get a MacPro no I'm
kidding that's not actually a better
solution so these are 3200 megahertz
c14 now if gigabytes not impressed with
what I'm doing with their high-end
gaming components I'm sure g.skill is on
a whole other level here throw the GPU
back in and then we're good to go this
is really a very horrible mounting
mechanism I'm not even gonna try and
screw it in this time I don't know why I
bothered okay so all that's left you
guys to fire it up and see if it still
works
there's definitely water in there come
on baby let's try giving it ye olde
receipt and see most clear and see if
that resolves it hey hey hold on no idea
what happened but it's up whoa my house
has been reset nice so theoretically all
we have to do is press 5.1 gigahertz Oh
see and it'll work now this will
probably take a few minutes changing
chipsets and check this shiz out my
friends we are booted not bad now
neither of our network controllers have
drivers here so I'm gonna have to
download those but then we should be
sitting pretty pretty quick here all
right so while I reboot for a driver
installed we're just gonna top up the
water here we did lose a little bit of
water and our new block takes up a lot
more of it so let's just do some
precision pouring with the Linus check
chips water bottle
not a supported use case for the Lynas
tech tips water bottle
that's about as full as it was before I
guess sick so the purpose of what we're
doing here is to ensure that we're
actually getting the 5.1 gigahertz that
were advertised when the systems are
idle is not necessarily gonna be running
at that speed but let's go ahead I hit
it with a heavy CPU load and see what
happens hey not bad okay then we
survived our Cinebench test so that
means the last thing for us to do is try
to enable XMP which will adjust our
memory automatically to its faster speed
and tighter timings I don't have a lot
of hope for this it's a good time that's
a good sign too now that we've got that
dialed in let's make sure it's not
completely unstable do a quick Cinebench
extreme run eight threads at over five
gigahertz said oh yeah and your server
has RGB now so we seem to be stable we
actually got 10 more points went from
568 to 578 so we're gonna go ahead and
shutdown Cinebench here no I don't want
to say that and Edie
show me where our sample project is why
don't we do the tech linked now Tech
linked even though it doesn't take that
long to render is the kind of project
where the faster it goes the nicer it is
because it's only about 10 minutes but
because we right shoot and edit it all
within the same day the faster it
exports renders and uploads the faster
everybody gets to go home so let's go
ahead and process is it just this one
right here so I'm gonna remove this from
the queue and we're gonna find out
what do you think I think it's gonna be
faster hey crash did even the reset
switch not work
that's pretty crash let's turn XMP off
and people wonder why I don't like XMP
never works alright we've got one more
trick up our sleeves I pulled two of the
sticks I think 16 gigs of RAM should be
plenty for our workload here and we're
gonna see if it's a little more stable
without all the memory slots loaded up
yeah there it is good good good
overclocked running at the right
frequency all right let's try that
sample project again now what's
interesting is our CPU is actually only
running it 4.8 gigahertz right now I
wonder if XMP is kind of screwing us
here all right guys we are really close
to results time here so for tech linked
our time to be is 9 minutes 48 seconds
and it looks like we're gonna come in
well under that let's have a look here
come on baby you have got to be kidding
me
9 minutes and 19 seconds maybe we really
did meet those other two cores so here's
the situation
we only beat our score by about 30
seconds which is not the kind of
improvement that we were looking for so
there's a couple factors at play here
one is that even though I don't think
this is an AVX workload it's kind of
behaving like one so our cpu turbos to
5.0 5 or 5.1 in Cinebench but only hits
4.8 here which looks like an AV x offset
so we're not getting quite the clock
speed we were expecting and - it appears
that my recollection may have been
incorrect or Adobe may have updated
their encoder because our CPU is getting
absolutely pinned to a hundred percent
in many cases here it may be that we
actually do need more cores so there's
no way around it
we need to reevaluate here this project
has really challenged everything I
thought I knew about our video export
workload so what we're gonna have to do
is take things entirely back to the
drawing board and to do that I've set up
a test bench here so it's much quicker
for me to swap things in and out with
Intel's
18 core 79 80 XE with the goal being to
determine well G exactly how many course
do we need for this how well does it
scale so the idea here is once we know
that we can then find the fastest chip
with that mini course and try this whole
thing again so based on what we're
looking at here with loads anywhere from
about the 75 to 85 percent range on this
thing we can guess and this will be a
far from perfect gas but we can guess
but maybe something in the neighborhood
of 14 course could be the right answer
fortunately we have a very unique ace up
our sleeve this courtesy of our friends
over at Puget because the only way to
get this chip is through Intel's like
secret special auction is a core I 999 9
t x e it actually has fewer course than
a 99 80 X C at only 14 verses 18 but it
turbos to 5 gigahertz and it's base
clock is 4 gigahertz so why don't we
give it a shot
shall we got nothing else to lose just
time naturally changing out the CPU
necessitates another motherboard swap so
once again this poor Horace water-cooled
board is getting pulled from a project
not because it did a bad job but just
because it wasn't the right fit
after all this going back to the
original block so stupid how bad is it
it's definitely dripping a bit now
something to be aware of guys is that
while electronics and water definitely
don't mix as long as they're not powered
the likelihood of doing permanent damage
is actually very low not very low it's
lower oh yeah I'm pretty bad this time
okay here we go and they're beautiful Oh
where's that block yep it's on the floor
so that goes to the inlet and that goes
to the outlet gladden Kevin for the
board I'm going with a prime X 299
deluxe not for any particular reason
other than that that's what I found on
the shelf all right so here we go even
though it's 14 compared to 18 cores
because of its much higher frequencies
this is a 205 watt TDP CPU and that's
assuming that's accounting for Intel's
optimism with respect to their TDPS all
right now we're ready blocks on cables
are routed strap it in all right it's
reassembled please work like just work
it occurs to me this is a relatively new
CPU and I have no idea when this board's
BIOS was last updated heck yeah heck
yeah all right it's good sign
chuckling transcode mov
and it doesn't look like it's going to
be any faster at all curiously our CPU
usage is significantly lower than it was
on the 18 core okay and our time is
looking like it's going to come in just
over seven minutes for the raw and code
which should put us right around the
same time so we're at nine thirty eight
which is ten seconds faster than our
original configuration but actually 20
seconds slower than our water-cooled
overclocks 9900 k but I think we can do
a little better here it occurs to me
that just because XMP didn't work on
that other board doesn't mean it won't
work on this one because it might have
been optimized for quad channel
operation so we're gonna go ahead and
try again with XMP good luck everyone
well this puppy's definitely haulin now
we're seeing turbo speeds floating right
around the 4 gigahertz range and that
estimated time remaining looks like it
might be as much as 30 45 seconds faster
than our last run what remains to be
seen is whether or not it's stable
surprisingly was stable enough to finish
the render all right good job XMP 850
wow so we actually crushed our original
time that time goes to show you what
more cores more clock speed and faster
memory will do for you wow that's almost
by a full minute so now that we've at
least managed to make the Machine faster
I think I'm gonna stop fooling around
because this is two full days that the
editors haven't had their transcode
server but I'm also feeling pretty
inspired right now because we did manage
to get better results than this with
that weird 1u gigabyte overclockable
server that we checked out a little
while ago so what I think is that with a
better designed water cooling system
maybe board with beefier VRMs or
something along those lines that we
could push this further I think our 500
watt power supply might actually be
holding us back as well so we're gonna
leave this one here for now but next
time I'm gonna be coming back at you
guys with a custom designed enclosure
that's really gonna let this thing rip
