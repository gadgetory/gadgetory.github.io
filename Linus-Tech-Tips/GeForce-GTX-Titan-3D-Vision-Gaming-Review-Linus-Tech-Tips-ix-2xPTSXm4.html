of the ways that you can really take
advantage of the extra horsepower
available in GPUs even with games where
you can already max the resolution you
can already max the details and they're
already running okay because what stereo
3d effectively has to do especially for
games that are not very well optimized
for example you're gonna see Crysis 3 is
incredibly well optimized for stereo 3d
on the geforce gtx titan so what it
effectively has to do is render the
image from two different sides for each
eye and then it works with the nvidia
driver to only show you one eye at a
time with the shutter glasses that that
make the whole 3d effect work so I
wanted to take titan and test it against
the other solutions that make sense for
3ds so unfortunately I haven't actually
tested any AMD cards because the last
time I took a run at stereo 3d with the
Radeon solution with with DDD the 3d
sort of third-party firmware it was not
a very intuitive set up compared to 3d
vision so I instead stuck with my
GeForce setup so I've got the GeForce
GTX Titan which is the new card
launching today I compare it against the
old flagship the geforce gtx 680
although it should be noted the geforce
gtx 680 isn't really making its way down
the stack it's not like the titan is
coming in and replacing it at the same
price point titan is significantly more
expensive than a gtx 680 so it's still
kind of a flagship but then titans like
a like a super flagship or something
like that and then finally my sort of
you know my my bang for the buck
solution which is two gtx 660ti s in sli
so without further ado here are my 3d
vision benchmarks let's start with the
one i alluded to before so crysis 3 at
1080p and 3d vision surround actually
only runs about ten percent slower in 3d
vision than it does just at 1080p on the
geforce gtx titan now with that said the
geforce gtx 660ti sli solution actually
outperforms the titan in this
particular game in 3d vision by about
you know about 3% or 4% or something
along those lines but we do still see a
clear separation of the Titan from the
previous generation ruler of the roost
in Crysis 3 moving along to Skyrim I
believe the mods that we've installed
kind of messed it up so again you can
look at these results but they're
completely meaningless because we
installed a bunch of mods that probably
broke 3d in a very big way so for
example the shadows which are sometimes
a problem with 3d even without modding
the game we're definitely an issue for
us
battlefield 3 however did quite well in
3d so you can see tighten and gtx 660ti
sli are neck and neck with the gtx 680
trailing behind so both of those other
solutions perform about 40 percent
better than the 680 so it's starting to
show it's not king of the castle miss
The Witcher 2 performs better with gtx
660ti sli than gtx titan I think part of
this is due to the fact that stereo 3d
is more about horsepower and less about
necessarily the the the frame buffer
which is what gtx titan actually has in
a big way over any of the other
solutions if we were to run 3d at a
higher resolution hypothetically because
right now we don't have any solutions
that are above 1080p stereo 3d then i
think that titan would start to just
absolutely demolish the other cards but
right now we don't really see that so it
looks like something like dual 660ti two
gigs or even three gigs in sli looks
like the ultimate solution for 3d well
not quite ultimate I mean you can throw
a couple Titans at it and that would be
more ultimate but in terms of at $1000
or less something like a couple 660 s or
a couple 670 s 660 C is rather would be
a great solution thanks for checking out
