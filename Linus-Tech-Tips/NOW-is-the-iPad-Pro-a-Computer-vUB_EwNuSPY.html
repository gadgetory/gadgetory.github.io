turns out iPad OS still does not make
the iPad pro a laptop replacement but
there is some good news because what it
does do is make it both a better iPad
and a better computer so let's talk
about what we mean by that and what it's
like to use it
speaking of using I'll use this
opportunity to tell you about our
sponsor Origin PC customized an Origin
PC desktop with an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
graphics card at the link in the video
description
it feels like every time Apple releases
a new iPad they seem to be making the
case yet again that tablets or
specifically their tablet are the future
of mainstream computing and you know
what that might end up being true at
some point but as we said in the
conclusion of our iPad Pro review in
order to lead us to that future Apple
needs to make iOS much more robust well
I guess Apple watches our videos because
it looks like they listen to us along
with hello every other tech reviewer so
at WWDC 2019 Apple announced that iPads
would get their own specialized version
of iOS called iPad OS with new features
that bring the iPad experience closer to
the one that you'd expect from a laptop
or a desktop including multitasking
improvements external drive support
finally and even Mouse support but
before you guys get too amped up watch
the rest of the video because it's not
quite what you'd expect or rather it
might be exactly what you'd expect I
mean this is still Apple we're talking
about so let's start with the homescreen
app icons are now smaller so you can fit
more on one page that's cool and you can
now slide the today view with its list
of widgets in from the left side now
let's talk multitasking split view and
slide over have gotten a big upgrade you
can now place two instances Apple is
calling these spaces but to simplify our
lives we're going to refer to them as
Windows so two instances of some apps
side-by-side like here you can see we
fired up two file windows or two notes
windows within the Notes app now you
could already bring up iPhone with apps
in slide over mode on iOS 12 but now you
can add more apps to slide over and you
can switch between them just like you do
with your full screen apps now as I
mentioned not every app supports spaces
right now
I couldn't open two word documents side
by side for instance but for the apps
that do support it this better use of
the screen real estate on the iPad is an
absolute godsend I mean I think it's
fair to say that it's easier than it has
ever been to work on a document
reference a webpage and message someone
at the same time on an iPad it does take
some getting used to especially once you
find out that there's now essentially a
multitasking expose menu for each space
and abled app and then that to see it
you've got to open the app then bring up
the dock and tap the apps icon again but
once you get all of that through your
thick skull it's completely intuitive
now let's move on to external storage
support I was tempted to not even give
Apple a point for this because its
absence was so dumb to begin with kind
of like copy paste that they shouldn't
get praised for implementing it but that
would be petty so I'll say this better
late than never
here's how it works you plug in fire up
the files app then using the new columns
views you can easily browse and transfer
the files on your external storage
device both of these features we're much
needed on a device with the pro moniker
and I couldn't be happier that they're
finally here
another much-needed feature is the
ability to load the desktop versions of
websites by default so you can access
desktop versions on iOS versions prior
to 13 but you need to tap and hold the
refresh button every time a page loads
so now browsing the web on an iPad does
feel more like using a laptop or a
desktop making our writer for this video
wryly want to smash the iPad pro into
the wall far less frequently next up
we've got some more minor changes that
make the iPad easier to use these
include new gestures requiring three
fingers so you can pinch to copy spread
your fingers to paste and you can also
tap three times or swipe to the left to
undo
pinching the on-screen keyboard will
shrink it down to phone size making it
even easier to use the new swipe to text
feature that Apple finally added and you
can scroll through pages using the
scroll bar rather than swiping down
endlessly now the Apple pencil where is
it notice also get some major
improvements it has even lower latency
which is impressive considering it was
already not imperceptible you can now
easily screenshot and annotate in any
app by dragging from the bottom corner
and with pencil kit developers can
natively integrate the pencil palette
into their apps so the pencil experience
will now be consistently great across
iPad apps not just in Apple notes so now
let's address the greatest fear of the
elephant in the room nice let's talk
mouse support it's finally here but it
is very unconventional and looks like
this so what they've done here is rather
than implement this much requested
feature in a predictable or conventional
way is well it appears that Apple has
begrudgingly added it in as part of
their assistive touch accessibility
feature so from their perspective it's
meant then for folks who have difficulty
touching the screen or who require an
adaptive accessory also known as a mouse
so okay then once assistive touch is
enabled you connect your adaptive
accessory via bluetooth or a dongle just
like you would any other device but the
thing is is that it's meant to emulate
physical touch not behave like a
traditional mouse and that becomes clear
the first time you try to use the scroll
wheel in certain apps or right-click for
a context menu
now assistive touch has quite a few
customization options available which
would seem to be very useful to people
who are actually using it as an
accessibility feature but they're just
honestly not that great for laptop users
who are just trying to use a freaking
Mouse on an iPad to be clear the
experience wasn't horrible it definitely
saved Riley some arm strain from
reaching up and tapping when he could
just move the mouse an inch and click
but it definitely does not suddenly make
the iPad pro just as good of a desk or a
lap based computer as a laptop would be
in fact adding a mouse almost made it
more apparent that trying to treat iOS
as a desktop operating system is a bit
of a masochistic endeavor Apple is
plainly making it clear that using a
mouse on iPad is just not part of their
vision for the platform which got me
thinking you know when I heard that
Apple was adding things like mouse
support external storage I thought great
the iPad is going to be more like a
normal computer but I was wrong because
Apple isn't trying to make the iPad pro
more like a computer they're trying to
help the iPad which is still very much
an iPad be more useful as a computer now
that might seem like I'm saying the same
thing but let me explain here I as a
power user expect to have certain
features on my computers a high
precision mouse or trackpad I expect a
desktop which I can populate with
Windows that I can move or resize at
will I expect a file manager that lets
me see all of the contents of my machine
and anything that I've attached to it
the way I want to see it
so to me the computer experience is
about giving the user the tools and the
freedom to use the machine the way that
they want to use it but the cold hard
truth is that is not what the iPad is
about
and that's clearer than ever with the
iPad OS update while iPad OS certainly
gives users more freedom than iOS 12 the
iPad experience is still very much about
embracing the machines identity as a
handheld Touch powered or excuse me
pencil powered as it were device but
here's the thing maybe just maybe that's
the right decision okay okay wait hear
me out guys I think up until now we've
been actually going about this video
entirely the wrong way like it's we
always go through the same song and
dance Apple calls the iPad a computer
that's a computer we laugh review it
against a laptop and scoff at its lack
of mouse support and pitiful file
management etc etc etc but while
Microsoft's dream was having one
operating system across phones tablets
and PCs and Samsung is meanwhile trying
to get their users to use their phone as
a desktop machine Apple isn't trying to
make the iPad into a laptop they already
sell laptops and they've been just as
resistant to adding touch support to Mac
books as they've been to adding desktop
features to iPads they clearly have no
desire to unify the experience of what
it's like to use an iPhone an iPad and a
Mac so someone who keeps comparing iPads
to laptops
is never really going to be satisfied
until Apple releases an iPad that's
basically a MacBook with the touch
screen which is a great idea and they
should do that but instead of doing that
Apple has chosen to add a new category
of productivity machines tablets that
aren't just giant phones that you use
for watching Netflix playing mobile
games and skyping sir excuse me
facetiming grandma and that aren't just
a harder to use and less capable laptop
so iPad OS is a vision of a future where
an artist or a business owner or a
family buy an iPad as their sole
computer because while it is certain
less efficient for some tasks a lot of
tasks if you only use your computer once
in a while why would you buy a bulky
awkward laptop instead I mean it does
say something that once Riley started
thinking of the iPad pro as less of a
bad laptop and more of a better iPad he
went and finished writing this review
sitting on a beanbag using the mini
swipe detects keyboard with word safari
and notes open on screen at the same
time and it wasn't bad like at least it
was more ergonomic so in conclusion then
we think that with iPad OS the iPad can
be someone's next computer but what
Apple needs to do between now and then
is to clarify their messaging because
it's been kind of a confusing mess so
far they'll say things like the iPad pro
can be your next computer so like wait
it's a computer but then they'll say
it's like a computer but unlike any
computer so wait it's not a computer
then they had this other campaign
describing the iPad as a new way to take
notes or make music or create a
presentation which i think is actually
the most accurate the ipad is especially
with ipad OS a new way to use a computer
a worse way for some people like myself
but perhaps a better way for others
