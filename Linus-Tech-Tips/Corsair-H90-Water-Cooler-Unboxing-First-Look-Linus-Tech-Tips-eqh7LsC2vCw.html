part of their hydro series it comes with
a five-year warranty it comes with a
silver box which is something that we're
not used to seeing with Corsairs liquid
coolers in fact this was quite
surprising to me it seems like a stupid
thing to fixate on but hey when you
unbox things for a living then you have
to find things that are interesting
about boxes so Corsairs packaging
generally has been black packaging but
we're not going to worry about that too
much let's focus on what's interesting
about the h9t number one is stop do not
return this product to the store contact
Corsair give them a chance to help you
out that's very important because their
customer service is pretty much
legendary at this point oh what's this
that is a 140 millimeter fan so unlike
the previous generation H 4 th 5855 h 6
th 70 + h 80 the h 90 uses a nya 90 I
got 90 millimeter fan for extreme
performance a 140 millimeter fan now it
uses a different design then course
there's recently released H 100 INH ATI
it has thinner blades but the largeness
of it should make up for any kind of
performance deficiencies from not using
their SP pressure optimized fan design
but I mean we'll see once we once we get
this thing installed and test it out
also inside we find a half the H 90
cooler itself so in terms of case
compatibility you do have to be a little
bit more careful with a 140 millimeter
radiator than you do with a 120 mil
because even though a case is compatible
with a 120 mil at the back it won't
necessarily work with a 140 at the back
however courser gives you enough length
on the quarter inch non evaporative very
flexible tubing that you should be able
to even do things like mounted in the
top of the case and then run it back
over towards your CPU socket for example
that will give you more options in terms
of installation than you'd have with a
limitation of just installing it at the
back although it might not make for the
same aesthetic so I would I would
definitely opt for a case with a 140 mm
fan at the back and enough room for the
tank at the top and the tank at the
bottom in terms of clearance we find
unlike the
recently-released h adi and h100 i the h
90 does not feature coarser link and it
doesn't have lighting effects on the cpu
block itself so it's more of a simple
cooler it also goes with as I mentioned
before 1/4 inch tubing versus the 3/8
inch tubing on those other coolers but
the additional surface area should give
it some pretty interesting performance
which we're very excited to to check out
the bottom of the CPU block is looks
like something pretty familiar so we've
got that ring locking mechanism for
mounting the block itself which allows
you to take here we go one of these
rings whether it's FM 1 FM 2 a.m. 2 a.m.
3 a.m. - plus whatever you want any AMD
socket from the last sort of couple
generations any Intel socket 754 6 2011
and put the compatible hold down plate
on top secured into place been use this
retention ring which is so much better
than the older systems that use the
retention ring to lock the whole thing
into place so you don't have to kind of
have 4 different hands working on it in
order to actually get one of these
coolers installed it's quite simple now
and comes with all the hardware you need
as well as detailed instructions there
they are from Corsair that include
little pictures and all kinds of good
stuff just like that for all of the
different platforms so in summary the H
90 no Corsair link but massive surface
area which should make it somewhere
between a single 120 millimeter thin
radiator cooler and something between
sort of that and a dual 120 millimeter
cooler probably somewhere in the middle
