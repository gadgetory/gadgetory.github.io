almost every SSD from OCC but the one
that I haven't looked at is the vertex
series turbo drive so these are almost
the same as the regular vertex drives
that means there are two and a half inch
solid state drive they have 64 Meg cash
they come in 30 60 and 120 gig
capacities but the key difference for
this one is that the vertex turbo
features the in the links controller the
in delinks bare foot controller it's the
same one but unlike every other end
links drive on the market it is slightly
overclocked so that means that the in
delinks controller in the vertex turbo
can actually process data just a little
bit faster than in the vertex the
agility and every other end of Link's
drive on the market so let's without
further ado get this baby opened up and
have a look oh you know what here here
hold on sorry Cameron here come have a
look here so we've got the basic specs
here read up to two hundred and forty
megabytes per second and right up to 145
megabytes per second with sustained
rights of 100 megabytes per second these
are not the important specs the
important specs come down to the random
reads and writes which the vertex
already does quite well so the vertex
turbo just adds a little bit of icing on
that cake okay you've got an
installation guide warranty info
preparation before use blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah okay thank you and
then we get to the vertex turbo drive
itself so it looks almost exactly like a
vertex drive except that oh man I can
get this open yeah there we go except
that it has yellow on the sticker just
like that okay so it's a matte black top
and you've got your vertex series turbo
co2 solid solid state drive sticker on
the top on the oh yeah mounting so it
uses the normal two and a half inch
mounting hole so you can use the ocz SSD
adapter you can use like basically any
other s SD adapter it's perfectly
compatible with most notebooks out there
so you've got both of the mounting
options on there here's another some
kind of warranty information thing on
the back of the drive you will find your
SATA power and say to data interfaces
these jumper pins are only for flashing
the firmware so only use them if you're
instructed to buy ocz or their website
thank you for checking out my own
boxing of the ocz vertex series turbo
drive oh by the way fat don't turn it
off yet this is a 60 gig I don't think I
ever actually mentioned that so there
are also one 20s and 30s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
