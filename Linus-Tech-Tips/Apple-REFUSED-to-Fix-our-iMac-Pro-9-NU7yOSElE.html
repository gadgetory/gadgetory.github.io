taking our eye MacPro to the Apple Store
for repairs only one small problem they
refused to fix it and we're not even
talking warranty service we understood
we would have to pay we wanted to pay
and they outright refused to fix it how
would the does that even work because
that was back on January 30th two months
ago
and our machine is still not repaired
this one gets interesting and you know
what else is interesting Mac Weldon Ngoc
Weldon makes great underwear t-shirts
socks wallets and more they believe in
simple shopping and if you use offer
code tectus you'll get 20% off on their
store
our story begins with Anthony's first
interaction with Apple support it was
pretty Pleasant all things considered
Apple representative Andrea was very
sympathetic but for some reason she
couldn't give us any guarantee that they
could actually do anything that should
have been a bright red flag but when
Anthony and Tyler later returned from
dropping off the pro at the local Apple
store they told me that well they smiled
told us they'd order the parts and get
us back up and running in jiffy are iMac
Pro review actually ended up coming
together pretty well in spite of our
limited ability to get additional b-roll
footage so all we could do at this point
was wait for our repair been a couple of
days later the Apple store sent a
follow-up email letting us know that we
could come pick up our computer and sir
what right have you have you responded
to this yet this is this is completely
unacceptable we know we've got it this
is her email get in touch with them some
other way get Yvonne T all of them
licked it we still have like three or
four videos to make with this thing that
yeah okay just see what you can do what
does this even mean if they are unable
to obtain the parts they wouldn't be
able to repair the iMac oh gee thanks
Jesse
so what at this point what are our
options there's just no recourse if we
can't get an Apple authorized service
provider to obtain the parts and these
are parts that Apple wouldn't even send
to their own store yeah I will contact
any ISP as mentioned he knows a guy so
are you guys following this so far we
thought there must have been some kind
of misunderstanding
remember we're paying for the repair
after all but the Apple Store confirmed
that they were unable to fix it because
HQ wouldn't send them the parts they
ordered and that our only option was to
come and get it back untouched and it
actually gets even better from here
because we asked well if Apple
themselves can't fix our computer who
can and we got told that the only option
was to bring it to a third party an
Apple Authorized service provider so
since there's no way for us to order new
parts from Apple directly and fix it
ourselves we reached out to one hey any
word back from your friend okay so new
update they can order the part but for
them to approve the sale they need
someone with Apple Pro certification and
unfortunately that doesn't exist yet
and let me guess even if it did if they
ordered it and just gave us the parts
they'd lose their certification yep so
Louis Rossmann you remember that guy
right he showed me the right way to fix
BGA solder joints so so he's constantly
complaining about Apple pulling crap
like this but not being someone who
repairs Apple's products for a living I
always kind of figured it was mostly
shop Talk
however as someone who now has to repair
an Apple product in order to flip it on
Craigslist no I don't believe that
anymore it's absolutely real like I get
it what Apple's done here is to release
a brand new platform that they are
unwilling and/or unable to provide
support for I mean yeah we broke it we
get that but I mean imagine this in some
other industry imagine if you bought a
brand new car
and drove it into a lamppost as you were
leaving the dealer then both the dealer
and your third-party insurer said that
they couldn't fix it because the parts
and the repair manual don't exist as far
as we can tell right now they expect us
to just roll over and accept that our
work station is now essentially just a
collection of pretty rocks for some
indeterminate amount of time because
they released a product without the
training or support structure necessary
to actually support it they've thrown
their support staff under the bus
they've thrown their authorized service
providers under the bus and most
damningly of all they've thrown the
customer because I bought this thing
under the bus
despite apples careful design accidents
do happen and if a former repair
technician can screw up from time to
time and trust me they do the end-user
will too so we're turning to our
community for bright ideas we still want
to repair this thing so we're gonna have
a forum thread linked below if maybe you
know a guy who knows a guy who can get a
board PSU and display or if someone who
works at Apple happens across this video
and agrees that you know what yeah that
is totally unacceptable well we'd love
to hear from them too for now we will
just continue to stew in impotent rage
over the sheer stupidity of this whole
situation but only for a little while
because it always lifts me up to tell
