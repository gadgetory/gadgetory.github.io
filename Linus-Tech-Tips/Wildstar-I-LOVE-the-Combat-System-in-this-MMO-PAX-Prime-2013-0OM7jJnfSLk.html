brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series so I'm here with David
bass the senior community manager for
wildstar I mean tell me about how long
you guys have been working on this game
wilders probably been an active
development maybe four or five years at
this point the studio was founded seven
years ago by a bunch of explicit
developers and they kind of spent the
first few years trying to figure out art
style building an engine doing some kind
of R&amp;amp;D and we really just started active
Dylan just a couple of years ago on what
what eventually became wildstar itself
ok so what I mean okay you're the
community manager so obviously an MMO is
all about playing by yourself not
connected online and really not
interacting with anybody so you can tell
me how are you trying to to break out of
that as the MMO that really okay I'm
messing with you guys so what are you
doing differently so as an MMO where
nobody plays together I don't actually
do anything on the project no I'm
kidding um I'm MMOs obviously community
is the most important thing explains why
he didn't have an actual business card
hahaha where'd you get this t-shirt from
oh I just stole it off a guy and then
someone brought me over here was like
hey you're gonna talk on camera but as
an MMO I mean obviously community is one
of the most important things if you
don't have players you've got an empty
world and so it's really important to us
to make sure the community understands
that we are a very responsive a really
open studio we've been trying to be as
transparent as we can be with the fans
both people in beta and people outside
of beta when something's not working in
the game we tell people here's what's
not working here's why it's not working
and when beta testers come to us and say
you know what this part of the game
sucks instead of saying to them well you
know that's kind of what we wanted to do
so suck it up we actually will go back
and look at it say okay they're not
liking it clearly there's something
wrong here so what is it what can we do
to make it better and so will engage in
that dialogue with the fans and we
really enjoy being able to be responsive
like that now you were saying a lot of
the dev time was spent on refining the
art style building an engine why would
you bother to build an engine at this
point when there's so many engines out
there that are fantastic that can be
licensed engines are amazing because
they give you kind of like that base
level to go in and do stuff but there's
also a lot of limitations there you're
stuck with I mean you can modify the
code and work your way through it but by
building your own engine it gives us so
much flexibility to
changeup stuff if if something's not
working if a programmer can't do what
they need to do if an artist is really
limited by the something on the art side
that is technical that I probably don't
understand then the guys who are
building our tools and building our
engines they go in and change it and
there's no problem they can do it really
fast the tools that we have available is
super cool we actually we might be
showing a demo on the booth later this
weekend of some of our tools but it lets
our artist just go in and literally just
paint on the world and so the art style
that you've seen is really cool because
we can translate that directly into the
game the concept are that you see
literally things in the game look like
that concept art whereas in other games
concept art kind of looks a little
different because you can't directly
port it to the engine but our engine was
built with this art style in mind now i
want to hear i'm gonna i'm gonna jump
ahead to our plan i want to hear the
pitch to someone who's a gamer they
understand the concept of an MMO but
they've never played one before why are
they gonna buy wildstar why are they
gonna play this so a lot of it but well
I got just got really squeaky there so
wild star is a MMO obviously but it's a
sci-fi MMO which is something that
people really haven't touched that much
on and in addition to that we've got a
very very unique personality with the
game we have very strong characters
strong personalities and we don't take
ourselves too seriously and the game
itself doesn't take itself too seriously
that's not to say there's not a really
interesting story in a really compelling
mystery going on in the world but at the
same time it's okay to hit for there to
be humor not everything has to be a
hundred percent serious world is ending
figure this out oh god we're all going
to die we can joke around a lot if you
see any of our trailers that we got on
the website both styles of animated
trailers versus explaining game features
we just kind of heard gamers playing
games and I think it shows a lot of the
stuff we do so with that said if it
doesn't take itself seriously then I
guess that leads us pretty well in to
give me the hardcore pitch then how do
you pitch this to the guys who are
playing Wow since the first day so while
we're not taking the story and like the
actual personality stuff very seriously
we are taking an end game really
seriously because everybody knows in an
MMO leveling contents all well and good
but if you don't have an end game when
you launch the game you're screwed
there's just nothing you can do to keep
those players around or to get them to
come back and so we're really focusing
on three aspects of the end game we got
for the solo player for the person who
just wants to level by themselves
and then you know play around an end
game they'll have their own story to
push through that only starts once you
hit the level cap we want to show the
story of the planet Nexus the mystery
surrounding it that stuff you'll only
really dive into when you hit the end
game as a solo player for the the
hardcore guilds for the groups of people
who want to do that group content will
have raids and we're doing old-school 20
men and 40 man raids that are going to
be really difficult it's okay for not
everyone to play those raids raids are
not supposed to be for everyone they're
supposed to be hard there's supposed to
give people a challenge and then for the
PvP player we've got a system well we've
got arenas and battlegrounds which are
you know the normal instant subjective
pvp arenas ranked you know rated small
group fights we also a system called war
plots we're not talking a lot about it
yet it's going to be 40 verse 40 groups
forming war parties where you actually
build your own fortress you build it you
customize it you can decide what paths
you want to force the enemy to take you
can actually go into a raid and capture
a raid boss and bring them back to your
war plot so that way the other team has
to fight against him and then you drip
bring your war plot to the fight the
other team brings their warp lot and you
guys just go crazy that sounds
absolutely bazonkers so tell me about
the combat because that's one of the
things that I keep hearing a lot about I
mean we've been asking people around
what what are you excited about we've
had some people say well I would star
and we kind of go why and they say well
it the combat is fascinating tell me
about it the combat is a really fast
paced it's an action combat game so
you're going to have Telegraph's when
you're using attacks you're going to
have these you know decals on the ground
that kind of show where your attacks
land which means that if you can
position people well you can hit as many
enemies as you can fit in that Telegraph
and the enemies all have the same types
of attacks you're going to be need to
need to dodge out of their attacks and
position yourself and stun them and
interrupt them and at the same time
we're also making sure that like healers
for example also have to deal with
Telegraph's healers can do the normal
extending in the back and targeting a
guy and hit in their heel but they can
also aim their heels if they want and so
if the group lines themselves up you can
heal everyone at once with a nice line
attack you can drop a big circle around
everyone and everybody knows where to
stay and so we want to take some of the
responsibility of the heel or off of
them onto the DPS where if the DPS are
not paying attention to where the healer
is that's their problem it's not always
the healers fault in the fight can you
talk about the end
tori system sure so the inventory we
have a bag system got a basic inventory
which is wow this is really full of crap
right now sander bag system you can
actually look here you got a bunch of
different bags you'll learn bags as you
play and you can also actually crafting
materials go in a separate satchel so
that way when you're collecting things
out in the world with your mining if
you're gathering seeds or whatever go go
into separate satchel separate from your
inventory because we got a lot of
different things you can collect okay so
can you can you show us some of the some
of the character customization you can't
show us the customization but you can at
least cycle through a few random
creations maybe talk about what we're
looking at yeah so right now we're
looking at the Dominion character
creation so we've got four races on the
dummy inside this is the makari female
and we've got a Makar email to these are
giant robots obviously and so the
character customization that was
terrible wave said the character
customization is currently work in
progress I wish I could zoom into the
face but you can see that you can change
the color of the hair the shape of the
hair the her we got its facial hair but
it's actually you know antennas and
different like technology things under
macari the chuo which we just announced
is a small furry little race and they've
got a bunch of different I types hair
types they're kind of cute and they're
actually genderless so you can click on
this and it doesn't actually change
anything we also have pink chu and blue
chua there's the pink the Drakken are
this crazy crazy horned fierce vicious
race so they got all kinds of different
horn types different hair they all look
super fierce and super scary so I really
really stoked to check it out tell us
about the monetization model so we just
announced our business model we're gonna
be doing a subscription-based game you
buy the boxing at 30 days free after
that you can pay fifteen dollars a month
to keep playing however we're also doing
something called cred which is a actual
in-game item that you can purchase with
real money and that cred if you redeem
it is redeemed for 30 more days of game
time so what that means is that we're
actually gonna have a marketing game
where if I'm playing the game for a
month and i'm earning tons and tons of
gold and i got all this money left over
I go on that market and spend my in-game
gold to buy a month of game time so i
can actually play the game for free if
I'm playing the game enough that I love
it and have all that money to spend
while someone else who doesn't have that
much time to spend but really wants to
get some goals maybe they want to buy
that new mount or whatever they can
spend some money to buy cred and sell it
to you on the market so way they get
some extra gold you get a free month and
now everybody's happy and the gold
sellers don't get anything so there you
have it guys it wasn't that long ago
that the word on the street was Oh
monthly subscriptions are dead but you
guys have taken a bit of a unique spin
on that and it sounds like it just might
work I guess we'll find out won't we
thank you so much for taking the time to
talk to us David this has been
absolutely great and uh good luck thanks
