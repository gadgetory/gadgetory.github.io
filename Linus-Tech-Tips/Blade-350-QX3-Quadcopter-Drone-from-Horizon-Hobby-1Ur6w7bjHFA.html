requested this but I enjoyed making that
video we did a couple weeks ago about
the parrot bebop and I want to make more
quad videos so here's my video about the
blade 350 qx3 a video about flying that
should be released around the time that
I'm landing in Asia which is going to
mean some unusual content over the next
little while here
Corsair H ATI GT and h100 GTX all-in-one
liquid coolers make your system look
better and run cooler - click my face to
learn more so let's start with the
unboxing experience something that
normally isn't that relevant to a
product for you but in this case really
sets the tone for the rest of the video
the first thing that stood out to me was
a wow horizon hobby did a great job of
packaging this sucker all but the most
determined parcel carriers would fail to
break your drone in shipping I'm sure
and B I am super impressed that all the
parts even the double-a batteries for
the transmitter are included in the
ready to fly drone plus camera kit but
horizon has some serious work to do on
the user friendliness if they want to
access the same kind of customer that
parrot is targeting with a product like
the bebop little details like the
three-piece battery charger versus
parents friendly socketed one and the
three separate pieces of documentation
required to actually use the product a
QuickStart guide with the assembly
pre-flight and most of the in-flight
instructions another booklet with the
interpretation key for the LED signals
that the 350 QX 3 uses to communicate
status updates and error messages to you
and a third full manual that isn't
included in the box so you can only
access it online and that has no obvious
reference made to it in the other
documentation something that was
particularly frustrating for me since
it's the only place you can find some
pretty critical information more on that
later first we'll do a physical tour of
the unit the design is very different
from the bebop it's significantly larger
for one thing and has a very hobbyist
grade feel to it every part goes
together predictably and seems like it
would be easily modifiable or swappable
out of the box that includes 4 brushless
motors a controller and receiver board
onboard GPS with an antenna mask for
better accuracy an accelerometer compass
and pressure sensor and if you get the
AP or aerial photography model and
integrated 130 degree fov 12 megapixel
camera that shoots 1080p 60fps video on
a three axis brushless motor eyes gimbal
with its own Wi-Fi hotspot for
real-time first-person monitoring with a
smartphone that you clip to the
controller that promises some seriously
stable aerial footage so for my first
flight I went through the whole
pre-flight routine including compass and
accelerometer calibration which involves
toggling some switches on the
transmitter then flipping the drone
around until it makes happy noises at
you and lets you know everything is
a-okay I faced north for takeoff blah
blah blah blah and then I found myself
wondering do I have to do this every
time horizon tells me once I ask them
that it's only if you move
geographically or change the weight of
the unit for some of the calibrations
but I guess I've made my point now about
what hobbyist grade means to the out of
box experience so I'm not going to
complain about the manual anymore but it
wasn't in there so let's talk about
whether hobbyist grade flight
characteristics make up for it I started
out with smart mode flight where you
stand still and the right stick makes
the drone move relative to the operator
rather than relative to its own
orientation so board word means away
from you as opposed to the front of the
drone SuperDuper boring so I switched to
AP mode in like a minute
but I can see how smart mode would be
handy if your drone was for example far
away and you couldn't properly see its
orientation in spite of the LEDs on the
bottom that should be a pretty good clue
as to which way it's facing I mean when
it gets really far away it's hard to see
that although if for whatever reason
smart mode doesn't work for that you can
use return home which works really well
you just flip the switch and boom it
comes back as long as it hasn't lost its
GPS signal in AP mode I was able to have
a lot more fun and I made some immediate
observations after my first flight the
first of which being that flying it is
fun this thing is quieter thanks to its
larger props and much more acrobatic out
of the box than the bebop and if you
have any RC experience at all you'll
really appreciate the way it allows you
to take control during a turn or a
sudden manoeuvre rather than trying to
compensate for you with an onboard
computer something that caused some
scary
feeling like I'm out of control moments
with the bebop where I was kind of
fighting with the onboard computer but
the flipside of that is that the 350 qx3
helps you a lot less with things like
maintaining
altitude while accelerating or turning
and requires you to manually compensate
with the left stick to avoid smoking the
ground if you're flying low which sorry
excuse me now the next thing I noticed
is that while the video feed range
frankly blows I tried to hold it
together your smile is what did it the
next thing I notice is that while the
video feed range frankly blows chunks
compared to parents sky controller with
its baller antenna array thing the
latency is much better and thanks to its
real physical gimbal versus digital
gimbal it's much easier to fly
first-person view with the third is that
a blinking RGB LED on the rear bumper is
not as good a way to communicate with
the pilot as a dedicated app so at about
13 minutes of flying when it started to
descend on its own it took me a second
to realize that the code on the back was
letting me know that it was done good
thing I wasn't over a body of water at
the time since I hadn't memorized all
the bloody codes yet and finally I found
myself missing the dedicated app again
when I realized the drone wouldn't go
higher than 20 meters with the
out-of-the-box configuration and I had
to go hook it up to a PC with the
included USB dongle in order to
reprogram it a process that is only
outlined in the online manual
fortunately the process is relatively
straightforward and the app is
surprisingly intuitive and stable you
can reconfigure your max range or max
altitude calibrate stuff and see some
diagnostic data thumbs up so with that
fixed the rest of my flight saw let's
talk about those once I figured out that
the protective housing comes off the
camera for the gimbal to operate derp
the camera footage is really really
really stable like awesome stable photos
look great and panning video shots that
were basically unusable on the parrot
look fantastic
it's low-light performance is also
better than the B box with less
blockiness and 60fps recording is a
welcome upgrade for fast motion but for
$500 I am a little disappointed with the
overall image there is so much
noticeable aliasing on straight lines
that it almost looks like upscale
720p or even lower and I found myself
wishing that there was an easy way to
Frankenstein a GoPro on to the gimbal
even if it meant losing the live feed
which leads pretty well into the
conclusion what do you get what does it
leave to be desired well you get a
prosumer slash hobbyist grade drone and
everything that comes with that better
modify ability than a consumer targeted
device more direct control of the
hardware you're flying but it also
assumes that you have some prior
knowledge that general consumers are
unlikely to have and is less forgiving
of mistakes I crashed the be-bop more
than half a dozen times dinking around
with it because thanks to its foam
construction and lightweight it felt
almost indestructible the 350 QX 3
should be treated with much more care I
cracked the landing gear and knocked the
camera off the gimbal on my first crash
from about 9 feet up so my final word
then is if you pick one of these up and
treat it right it'll treat you right in
return oh and I also probably recommend
checking out the two axis gopro gimbal
mount that i didn't get in time for this
review but I'm hoping to check out in
the future speaking of deals our friends
