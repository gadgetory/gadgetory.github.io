that we've ever done on - tech tips
powered by Intel today we're going to be
showing you guys step-by-step how to
build your very own gaming system in the
better class so that means we're
spending around $1,500 on the tower
sword if you subscribe to that good
better best way of thinking which means
we're not really compromising any
features in any performance and we're
not spending so much that it's sort of
just for bling and bragging rights
either we're going to be installing
windows 8 we're going to talk about some
of the benefits you get from windows 8
including in some games better
performance and we're going to be
pairing it with a touchscreen and
talking about some of the ways that
touch really makes Windows 8 come to
life whereas the mouse and keyboard do
not part of getting the best bang for
your buck is overclocking so everything
we've got in front of us here is
overclocking optimized in some way or
another now I want you to think about
your gaming experience kind of like pi
because the two most important things
for pi are crust and filling so I'm
going to go ahead and say the CPU is
kind of like the crust it supports the
rest of the system if it's not fast
enough
you're going to end up with bottlenecks
so if you spent like $1,000 on a
graphics card and a hundred bucks on a
CPU that graphics card would never reach
its full potential anyway so in this
case for our crust we've gone with a 35
70 K it performs just slightly less than
the 3770k in gaming applications because
it doesn't have hyper threading it's a
Core i5
but because it's a KC Reis cue you can
overclock it to really squeeze the most
performance possible out of the
architecture we're going to be aiming
for anywhere from around 4.4 to 4.5
gigahertz on our CPU the graphics card
is kind of like the fruity filling it
doesn't work at all without the crust
but it really makes the experience
particularly from a gaming standpoint
enjoyable this is what enables all those
visual effects and we've gone with the
geforce gtx 660ti power edition from msi
it's an overclocking optimized card with
a dual fan cooler and I mean it performs
great at stock too so if you're not
comfortable overclocking you can always
run it that way if the CPU and graphics
card are kind of like pi then I guess
the rest of this stuff is sort of like
ice cream because it definitely makes
the experience better and you can't
really have
pie without ice-cream and you can't have
a computer without all this other stuff
so I think that's where the analogy sort
of breaks down but for our motherboard
with the z77 AG 45 from MSI this is for
a couple of reasons it's extremely
inexpensive it's z77 so it's
overclocking ready and it is crossfire
and sli ready meaning we are able to
have a ton of flexibility in terms of
graphics upgrade options
speaking of flexible graphics upgrade
options the GS 700 from Corsair has a
three-year warranty a single strong 12
volt rail I mean you can hook up
whatever you want to it without worrying
about it having an overcurrent
protection shut down because you
connected everything to the wrong
connectors don't worry about any of that
it looks great and you can change the
colors from red to blue to white to
completely off to match your bill
depending on what route you want to go
the memory choice might seem a little
bit weird because you probably know that
more than eight gigs isn't really
necessary for memory and we've gone with
16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 1600
memory so the reason for that is pretty
simple if you buy a dual channel kit
you're going to buy two sticks to get
the most out of the bandwidth available
to your CPU okay if you buy to four gig
sticks then you're going to be limited
to a total of 16 gigs for upgrading
unless you want to remove those sticks
and add in a completely new set so the
reason we've done this is because it
gives you the potential to upgrade to 32
gigs without running into compatibility
issues by mixing and matching dims down
the road or being stuck at a maximum of
16 gigs now you might think that the
computer case is all about aesthetics
but the CM storm Scout 2 from
Coolermaster does more than that it's
got great cooling it's very rugged the
durability of it the build quality of it
is outstanding considering the price and
it's very portable it has a handle on
the top that's so strong that when I did
my unboxing of this case I was able to
hold the entire case up by the handle
and shake it around without any flex and
without it breaking it means you can
haul your rig around to land parties
without worrying too much about it and
it looks really good so yes there's
there's aesthetics as well it is a
factor for cooling we've gone with SP
120 quiet Edition fans from Corsair I
personally find that static pressure is
more important than sheer airflow when
it comes to getting the most out of your
system so I do prefer ESPYs
almost all scenarios and for the CPU
we've gone with a hydro Series H 100 I
liquid cooler this is going to allow us
to reach that overclock that we wanted
and because it comes with Corsairs link
software we can monitor things like
fluid temperatures system temperatures
and fan RPMs using software keeping
close close tabs on our system to make
sure it's running at peak efficiency the
storage subsystem really comes down to
personal choice but what I'll do is I'll
explain why we went with what we did so
we've gone with an Intel 300 series 180
gig SSD we didn't have a big enough
budget for a 240 gig SSD and rather than
going for a 520 series we sacrificed a
little bit of performance to get a bit
more capacity because I personally find
that 120 gigs is not quite enough these
days if you're running a pure SSD boot
drive for all of your OS application and
gaming needs we also added a Seagate
Barracuda 3 terabyte drive for mass
storage because let's face it SSDs
aren't at the point yet where they're
inexpensive enough that you can store
everything on them this gives us a
couple of interesting options we can go
with a 180 gig drive and three terabytes
for storage or if you find that 120 gigs
is enough you can go with a 120 gig boot
drive partition away 60 gigs of it use
it as a cache using Intel Smart Response
technology which is built into your z77
board and you can have a super speedy
boot drive with a few key applications
then on cache SSD accelerated mass
storage drive where you can install
things like games so your most
frequently used applications will be
much faster than if they were just
stored purely on a mechanical drive when
it comes to peripherals things get real
personal real fast for our monitor we
went with an Acer T 2 3 2 HL this is a
10-point multi-touch touchscreen monitor
remember we're talking about the windows
8 experience and how touch really makes
it come to life it's also an IPS screen
which means better viewing angles and
better color reproduction which I
personally will prefer to the faster
response times but lower color depth of
a TN panel not everyone will agree with
me on that one and that's fine for our
headset we want the vengence 1300 from
Corsair because they're relatively
inexpensive they sound pretty good and
they're lightweight and comfort
however there are more premium options
out there such as the siphon SteelSeries
this one in particular also matches our
build pretty well with a white and blue
color scheme for the keyboard again this
is personal choice not everyone believes
that you even have to spend a lot of
money on a keyboard for gaming but I
personally find that a mechanical
keyboard really enhances the typing
experience and I prefer it for gaming
and this is the quick-fire pro from CM
storm this particular one has Cherry MX
brown switches but you can choose almost
any switch Under the Sun you want and
what I like about the quick-fire Pro is
it has great build quality and it comes
in at a very very reasonable price point
considering the budget of the rest of
the components we're looking at here for
our mouse we went with the Vengeance M
65 you could go with the m95 if you play
more MMO games than FPS games it has
more buttons and stuff but what we liked
about the M 65 is it's got the latest
laser sensor offering up to 8200 dpi
it's from Corsair so you can't really go
wrong and it's white which matched the
rest of our build without being
overpriced for our mousepad so last but
not least we went with a steel series
qck this is just the standard sized one
you don't have to get a huge mousepad
unless you're a low sensitivity gamer
and it's available not only in the plain
black one you see here but also any
number of different configurations with
cool game gaming artwork and all that
kind of cool stuff like that the actual
tools you need to build a computer are
pretty straightforward I use a big
Phillips screwdriver and a small
Phillips screwdriver for when I can't
get access to those hard-to-reach areas
the most important thing really is a
static free workstation that means no
carpets no cat hi
and most importantly no clothes actually
wait no sorry clothes are okay but no
carpets and no cats
now Tech's who do a lot of work might
have a dedicated static resistant test
platform for making sure that components
work before you install them in the case
where some issues can occur but let's
face it you guys are watching this video
you probably don't have one of those so
in a pinch a motherboard box is an
optimal place to test the components
before you actually install them into
the chassis before we can assemble our
ghetto test bench
we've got to remove the mother
word from the box now the only pieces I
need are the IO shield and the SATA
cables other than that we're going to
leave everything inside if we were
running SLI for example we would also
take out the sli bridge next is the
motherboard itself we remove that from
the ESD bag this protects it during
transport put that inside the box and
being careful not to touch any of the
sensitive electronics you can see I'm
actually holding it by the heatsink and
the backplate here we put that onto our
makeshift test bench installing CPUs is
so easy now lift up the retention arm
lifts up the hold down plate no need to
remove the protective plastic cover yet
align the little gold triangle on the
top of your CPU with the triangle on
your motherboard itself like so close
down the hold down plate close down the
retention arm a little bit of strength
required here and check that out the
plastic cover will pop off and your CPU
socket pins were never exposed in order
to make use of dual channel memory take
your two memory sticks remember we're
using two so that we have expandability
for later and install them in the
color-coded memory slots by pushing down
firmly on both sides after opening up
the tabs on the side now I personally
prefer to install them in the slots
furthest away from the CPU socket
however because we're using a liquid
cooler we don't have to worry about any
clearance issues but if you were using
an air cooler then this is definitely
the recommended way to do it we're only
going to need this for the out of the
case testing but I do recommend
installing that stock heatsink that came
with your CPU the pins are already in
the correct position out of the box the
only thing to watch out for is make sure
you've got enough length on the 4 pin
connector to reach the CPU fan header on
your motherboard push them down in a
cross pattern one waiting for the click
then plug it in we're going to use this
to make sure that the system posts
before we proceed now don't worry guys
I'll show you all of these steps in
detail once we do the proper assembly of
the computer
but basically all I've connected here is
24-pin power 8-pin power two 6-pin power
adapters to the video card I've
connected a DVI cable so we can find out
if the system boots and I have plugged
in a keyboard just in case we have to
press anything in order to confirm that
yes indeed we do want to boot up so
let's go ahead and this board does not
have onboard switches so we can use a
key a screwdriver or anything else
metallic to short out the power switch
and now we'll find out if our components
are working so press f1 to run setup and
we have at least basic functionality
time to proceed with the full build
preambles over folks time to actually
build this thing so you can follow along
step-by-step and I guarantee you anyone
will be able to build the exact computer
that we're building here today and most
of the principles can be applied to
pretty much any custom machine that you
would build at any time step 1 inspect
your case for any damage because you're
going to want to let the retailer or the
manufacturer know if anything bad
happened to it during transit step 2 is
to take off the side panels even though
many cases ship with thumb screws often
they're too tight from the factory to
remove by hand so you have to loosen
them with a screwdriver put all the
screws you take out somewhere safe such
as in a little tray and I recommend
putting the side panel somewhere safe
because you guys wouldn't believe how
many times I've put a side paddle down
somewhere and tripped over it as I go to
do something else scratching it so the
place I recommend keeping it is in the
box that your case came in with the
styrofoam pieces in between the two side
panels so that they don't get damaged a
lot of people ask me what screws and
adapters do I need in order to build my
computer the simple answer is your case
comes with all of that stuff most cases
come with either a box or a baggie
inside that contains the screws you need
to completely outfit that case with
whatever hardware it happens to support
so in this case in this case we've got a
cardboard box that was mounted in one of
the three and a half inch hard drive
cages that has here we go all the driver
rails and speakers and zip ties even
that you'll need to assemble your
computer in most high-quality cases the
cables inside that are pre-wired are
going to be tied up in some way to keep
them from scratching up the inside of
the computer so you can free all of them
free the ball don't worry we'll do cable
management later so that you can make
sure that they're all going to reach the
places where they need to plug into now
I don't like to have my motherboard
lying around so it's the first thing
that I'm going to put in my case when
I'm building the new computer you need
nine motherboard standoffs these are the
little golden guys with the hex shape
and Coolermaster includes a convenient
little tool that allows you to drive
them into the motherboard tray with a
Phillips head screwdriver so you're
going to install them assuming you're
using an ATX board that is a full length
board you're going to be installing them
in holes a b c d e f JKL the other holes
on the motherboard tray are for
different sizes of motherboards you can
consult the manual if you're not sure
which one is right for yours putting in
i/o shields can be a little bit tricky
just make sure that you press on all
four corners firmly to ensure that it's
actually in place before you try to
install the motherboard before putting
the motherboard in make sure you've got
the right screws by doing a quick test
fit to ensure that the threads match up
with the threads of the standoffs that
you just installed hold the motherboard
by something that's not going to damage
it this is why I recommend having the
stock heatsink on there we're going to
remove it later to install our liquid
cooler and approaching at an angle line
up the i/o ports at the back
then hold the motherboard in place while
installing at least one screw so that it
doesn't move around because that can
scratch up the back of it you don't have
to wrench it super tight it just has to
not move
are you powered up actually you're not
powered up at all yet because you don't
have a power supply in your computer yet
when you install your power supply you
have two main options for a bottom
mounted power supply you can either
mount it with the fan on top which will
draw air from inside the case and
exhaust it out the back the advantage is
that you're drawing more air through the
case and out the back the disadvantage
is that you can be more likely to
accumulate dust because you don't have
any dust filter right next to it which
you would if you mounted the other way
and the other disadvantage is that
you're using warmer air to cool the
power supply the other option is
flipping it fan side down so in this
case our storm Scout 2 as a filter on
the bottom which should keep the insides
clean but the disadvantage is if you put
your case down on a plush carpet it
might suffocate the power supply and it
might not get enough fresh air
so think carefully about how you're
planning to deploy your computer before
installing the power supply I generally
go fan up because particularly with our
graphics card we're going to draw some
of that heat away from the graphics card
and out the back of the case using this
additional fan for cooling line it up
with the back of the case install the
four screws and it actually takes less
time to install a power supply then it
takes to think about how to install a
power supply at this stage of the game
although building a computer is no game
I recommend plugging in whatever
connectors you can because as you fill
the computer up with more components
it'll get hard to get at some of those
little finicky ones so we're going to
start with the main connectors that go
into the motherboard the Scout 2 has
built-in cable management so we can run
our 24 pin through this gap right here
and then bring it up right next to the
connector on the motherboard making it
so that you don't even see the wires
really
the 8-pin connector can be routed in
much the same way going through that
cable management hole in the bottom up
behind the motherboard tray through the
little hole and then into the eight pin
connector up at the very top left corner
of the motherboard guys if at this point
you break open the user manual or the
QuickStart guide for your motherboard
there is no shame because installing
these front panel connectors can be a
little tricky and while many
motherboards have labels directly on the
board for what's what often they're
actually not very clear so feel free to
check it out in there we're going to
start with USB USB 3 is an easy
connector to plug in and it's easy to
find because it's very distinctive
looking also it's keyed so it only goes
in one way
on our motherboard we have a right-angle
USB 3 connector so there won't really be
any strain on the cable or on the
fragile pins inside but not all
motherboards have that so make sure that
you don't have it
wrenching on the connector itself USB 2
is a smaller connector and the way this
one works is there's a blocked-off pin
on the bottom of the lead coming from
your case and there's a missing pin on
the motherboard itself as long as the
blocked-off pin corresponds to the
missing pin you won't have any issues
just make sure you're actually plugging
it into a USB header because it looks
quite similar to some other headers next
is front panel audio usually this is
located on sort of the left-hand side of
the board near the bottom left corner
this one has a blocked-off pin but it's
in a different position than USB 2 so as
long as you make sure that that
corresponds to the missing pin on the
connector you won't have any difficulty
with that one in either plug in HD audio
if you have the option only very old
motherboards rely on the AC 97 standard
which brings us to the trickiest part
power switch reset switch power led and
hard drive led for the power switch and
the reset switch the orientation is not
important it doesn't matter
don't worry about positive and negative
just plug them in and this is what I
mean about some other boards not being
clearly labeled the power and hard drive
LEDs do rely on being plugged in a
certain way and on this particular board
the positive and negative terminals
aren't labeled so I'll have to consult
the manual to make sure I get them right
don't worry though if you plug them in
wrong it's not going to damage anything
your LEDs just won't light up so you can
crack it back open reverse them and
they'll work just fine okay we could
have used the fans included with the
h100 eye but they wouldn't be so sexy
like these ones with the little white
mod rings on them of course that
includes white blue and red rings in the
box so you can pick whatever you want
for your color scheme we went with white
to go with our white case now not
everyone would want to use an h100 eye
in this case because it's a bit of a
weird mounting situation where what you
do is you remove the top plastic plate
here and you mount the radiator a little
bit externally now if you're into the
sort of modded hot rod look then you
might like that if you're not into that
go with an H ATI instead it doesn't
perform quite as well because it's a
single 120 millimeter radiator but it
still supports Corsair link it's a thick
radiator so it performs about as well as
a single rad can and it's going to keep
all the components inside so what we're
going to do is we're going to start by
removing the stock Intel cooler now that
we don't need that anymore
we're going to pop out that top piece of
plastic on the case using the tabs
inside we're going to get the radiator
in position screw the fans in from the
inside then it's time to mount the CPU
block and pump combo unit to the
processor itself the trick with mounting
the fans to the rad with the H 100i is
making sure that you get the right
screws so there's a lot of screws in the
box you can consult the manual if you're
not sure otherwise find the one that
looks like what I'm holding up because
we're going to go through the fan
through the top of the case and into the
red make sure as you're positioning it
you leave the leads the three pin fan
connectors somewhere near the back of
the case so you can hide them and not
have unsightly wires cluttering up your
build the other thing is this is where
you decide whether you want to push air
through the radiator or pull air through
the radiator
I prefer pull because it allows you to
clean it more easily without removing
the fans first lining up the screws and
the fans and the radiator can be a
little bit tricky and to avoid the risk
of cross threading I recommend starting
them with your hands to make sure that
you're not putting it in wrong before
you tighten them up with the screwdriver
the last benefit of the SP fans that I
didn't mention before compared to the
stock ones that come with the H 100i is
the fact that they have rubber
noise-isolating mounts meaning they'll
pass fewer vibrations to your computer
meaning less noise because we mounted a
stock cooler we will need to remove the
thermal compound that's left on the CPU
however we don't need to replace it the
thermal compound that comes on our H 100
I is extremely high quality so if you
ever do need to remove thermal compound
use a lint-free cloth for the final
stage but you can clean the bulk of it
off with toilet paper and 99% isopropyl
alcohol the higher percentage for the
alcohol the better and the more clean
it's going to be now the hardware you
need is extremely sturdy this is why I
like the H ATI in the H 100 i but there
are a lot of pieces so we need the Intel
magnetic hold down but this is why I
love it it's brilliant just click it on
like that
we need the Intel backplate for
everything but LGA 2011 we need the four
mounting posts that are going to hold
the backplate onto the motherboard and
then we need the four thumb nuts which
are going to hold the magnetic mounting
plate down to the mounting posts which
are attached to the backplate that's
what makes it secure and that's what
makes it once you've done it a couple
times pretty darn easy to do now believe
me when I say guys I'm as happy as you
that we're getting close to the end of
the little tricky parts but we're not
quite there in order to control the fans
in the system using Corsair link we use
the included adapters that come with the
H 100 I to plug into the CPU block and
pump unit then what we'll do is we'll
connect all of our fans to these and in
this case we had to get one additional
splitter in order to hook up the front
fans on the case there we go then we can
use software for our controls next up
we'll have to plug the USB connector
into the side of the CPU block and then
into a header on the motherboard just
like we did before with the front USB 2
connector
and last but not least we're going to
plug in the leads that are built
directly into the CPU block which is the
fan rpm monitor or or pump rpm monitor
and a SATA power connector that we can
run through the back so that it actually
powers the pump itself throughout any
kind of system build it's important to
think about cable management if you want
to have a chance of having it look tidy
when you get to the end so this is the
first time we're plugging in a power
connector other than to the motherboard
from the power supply so it's important
to make sure that we've routed somewhere
that we're going to be able to tie it up
tightly later on after the fact it's
great that we're using corsair link in
the h100 i in order to plug in all of
our fans but we have to actually plug in
that SATA connector that I showed you
before so we're going to route this sort
of on this side of the 24 but on this
side of the a pin in order to make it so
that we're going to be able to close our
case easily once we're finished
so now by plugging this in we have
provided power for all five of the fans
in our case we're going to leave the
front fans there white LED fans there
wired into the case in such a way that
you can turn them on and off with the
push of a button which is very cool but
we're going to replace this last rear
fan with one of our SP fans so we have a
more consistent look to the inside of
our build all you got to do is remove
the four fan screws from the back
probably gonna like fall out here there
we go that wasn't so bad
keep those four screws because they're
the same kinds for pretty much all fans
we're going to take our SP fan again
making sure to orient the connector so
that we can easily route it behind the
motherboard tray for maximum tidiness
and software control then we're going to
put those four screws back in and now we
have a nice consistent look to the
inside of the system look at this we're
getting there it's time to put in our
storage devices so we've got our SSD for
which we will need I just use two screws
because I'm lazy and it's an SSD it's
not like it's going to get damaged if it
you know Falls around or whatever else
and because the CM storm Scout 2
supports SSDs natively all we have to do
is grab one of these two and a half inch
drive sleds screw it in
on the bottom with two of the included
screws that come with the case there we
go there we go just like that looks good
pop that back in and our SSD is
installed except for the power and SATA
connectors at the back for the hard
drive things are a little bit different
we're going to use the sleds
so the rails that were included in that
cardboard box we're going to plug these
in with the tabs towards the front that
is where the connectors are not on the
drive and then the short ends where the
connectors are at the back we take that
whole assembly with the to sled rails
and the drive itself and we slide that
in until we hear a nice satisfying click
so let's get all those fans connected
now we used one splitter on one of our
four fans that we can plug directly into
the Corsair link module so those ones
are going to be our two front fans in a
plug goes directly into that splitter
we're going to control them at the same
time and we're not going to be able to
monitor the RPMs of both of them so
that's okay because if one of those fans
fails it's really not the end of the
world whereas we're going to dedicate a
full connector to each of the fans on
the h100 eye because if one of those
fails it could be a problem for us in
terms of CPU overheating especially if
we've overclocked it really far for our
rear 120 millimeter fan that one gets
its own fan header as well so that we
can control each of the zones of the
case separately using the software we're
also going to plug in our front drives
so power is routed with another one of
our two SATA harnesses that we have on
this power supply giving us four SATA
connectors so we can easily plug in our
hard drive right here
then we can use the next connector for
our SSD which is right here this gives
us two more connectors that we could use
for additional drives without using any
adapters now we need those two SATA
cables that came with our motherboard
both of which are right angle cables
which is fine because we can use the
angled side on the back of the drives
then we can use the straight side to go
directly into the already angled
connectors on the motherboard the only
real thing to watch out for is as you
can see on this board it clearly states
use SSDs in the top two ports as opposed
to the other ones don't worry it's not
going to break anything if you use a
different drive but you'll get the best
performance if you plug your SSDs into
the native Intel serial ata three or six
gigabit per second ports now it's really
no secret I'm not the master of cable
management by any stretch of the
imagination but I want it to at least
look decent from the front so we're
going to take our molex harnesses which
we didn't end up using a single 4-pin
molex connector we're going to hide
those on the other side of the
motherboard tray what's great about this
case is there's lots of room for hiding
unneeded cables so we're going to turn
this around so you guys can actually see
what I'm doing there we go we're gonna
hide this in the front just like that
just find somewhere to tuck it it
doesn't really matter then what we're
going to do is we're going to take some
of those zip ties that came with both
our power supply and our case and we're
just going to organize these cables on
the back so that they're not in the way
of anything when we try to close the
side panel I'm not worried too much
again about them being super gorgeous so
I'm going to take this bundle and I'm
going to kind of tie it up like this and
I'm going to take this bundle and I'm
going to come tied up like this with the
objective being to keep things flat so
that the side panel closes without any
difficulty you don't want to tie things
too tight because then you're going to
end up with undue strain on the
connectors which can damage them over
time if you've hung with us this long
you're almost at the end all that's left
now is to install the graphics card so
the first thing we're going to do is
remove the
two thumb screws that correspond to the
PCI Express 16x slot now PCI Express 16x
slots are not all made equally there's
physical and electrical specifications
so if you're not sure which one's the
right one to get the most performance
out of your graphics card it's usually
the top one if you're still not sure
consult the user's manual and it'll tell
you what each of them is wired up for so
once we remove those two screws and the
two PCI slot covers that are in there
all we have to do is align the PCI
Express 16x interface at the bottom of
the card with the PCI Express 16x slot
on the motherboard push down firmly
until the connector locks into place
then put the thumb screws back in and
then it's time to connect the power
cables we're going to route these much
the same way we've done before
along the back of the motherboard tray
which now looks a little better than it
did before with some of the zip ties
that we've put in place these are going
to come out right near the graphics card
itself which is what's so great about
these modern cases with cable management
I remember back in the old days we
didn't have that and we walked to school
both ways uphill and it's snowing and
there was fired brimstone all over the
place and anyway I think I'm off on a
bit of a tangent here so this particular
graphics card requires two PCI Express
six pin connectors which we will plug in
and our build is now almost complete
still got to power it on
make sure she works and close up the
side panels now I'm about to do
something that's incredibly bad luck I
haven't booted up the machine yet and I
am going to close one of the side panels
usually when I close the side panel
before I make sure it works it doesn't
work on the first crack and there's one
small thing I have to fix but I'm hoping
that since we've you know gone to great
lengths to make sure that this is an
awesome build that you guys can follow
along with that we haven't actually made
any mistakes so our right side panel is
on our left side panel check out what
that looks like
isn't that a gaming rig that you'd be
proud to call your own all right we're
going to remove the little plastic cover
the windows inside here is we're going
to try it's on there pretty good hey
there we go there's the one we'll take
off the outside one once we're done
putting it on helps to have it oriented
the right way there folks
do recommend doing that and she is
closed this is what our $1500 gaming
machine looks like and it's time to fire
up
don't forget your thumb screws and
everything's working or is it now that
we've got the system booted up it's
really important to run a couple basic
utilities to ensure that it's firing on
all cylinders before you call your
system done because the last thing you
want is to find out that there's a
slight instability somewhere down the
line in the middle of doing something
critical only to have it go and turn off
power down reset have corrupted data
anything like that so we're going to
walk you through the basic stuff that we
run to ensure the system is working at
peak efficiency now the first three
utilities are mostly for your CPU and
they kind of go hand-in-hand in face or
other hand if you had three hands and
that's what they would do and they're
mostly important if you're overclocking
in our case we over voltage our CPU to
one point three two volts and turn the
multiplier up to 44 megahertz because
it's unlocked so overclocking is that
simple these days more voltage more
megahertz until it stops working so in
our case we got to make sure that it's
working and how do you know
well CPU Z tells you if the overclock
actually took so you can see right here
we're running at 4400 megahertz which is
4.4 gigahertz so that's awesome that's
working next up is prime95 so you go
into options torture test small FFT and
then press okay and it'll run this test
for at least I would recommend 24 hours
to ensure that your CPU is not making
any calculation errors that tells you
that it's actually working correctly
even though you've amped the frequency
way up the last one that you want to use
is right here real temp GT and as long
as your CPU is staying at around I'd say
85 degrees tops and this is under load
this is under an intensive artificial
load you'll never
see a load like this in the real world
unless you're doing some pretty
intensive stuff like folding at home for
example so you want that to stay under
around 85 degrees to make sure your CPU
doesn't throttle thermal throttling is
when the CPU slows itself down like whoa
I can't handle this I got to slow myself
down to keep myself cool enough that I
can you know handle it not die so we're
not reaching that point which means our
overclock is good to go and our prime95
is stable there are other applications
you can use instead of prime95 but it's
the one that we've always been using and
we just kind of like it so there you go
there's my tech tip now speaking of the
importance of temperatures graphics card
temperatures are huge what if something
went wrong with your graphics card or a
fan failed for example or it wasn't
mounted correctly it got jiggled loose
and shipping or something like that when
you got your graphics card so you want
to make sure your graphics card is
running right before you start firing up
games on it as well so we use a couple
of programs called MSI's afterburner and
combustor and combustor is spelled very
uniquely so don't mind that but we use
these to make sure that the graphics
card is running correctly so we can load
it up with combustor then we can monitor
our temperatures we can see that it's
running at about 76 degrees which is
more than okay for these graphics cards
anything up to about 90 to 95 degrees is
actually okay for a modern graphics card
and that tells us again so besides our
CPU our graphics subsystem is running
correctly as well the last thing that
I'd really recommend running but I can't
show you when Windows here is mem test
86 you load that onto a USB Drive throw
that in your system and it that'll test
your memory to ensure that nowhere
within your system are any errors being
made that way you know you can trust it
to be a hundred percent stable here's
another software tip for you guys head
to 9 night and I n ite dot-com as the
first thing you do with your system once
you've made sure it's working correctly
select all the stuff you want to install
you want web browsers kernel them up or
Firefox you want iTunes Skype java.net
air shockwave Dropbox Google Drive all
that good stuff all you got to do is
select all the things you want get
installer it avoids all the bloatware
that comes with the programs and it
doesn't automate it install of all of
with default options without you
touching it at all and there's one
really important one you Windows 8 users
might want to check out under utilities
get classic start because it is a
fantastic start menu that adds
da-da-da-da the Start menu to Windows 8
not only that but you can decide which
kind of Start menu you want and there
are a ton of settings that you can
change and reconfigure and make the
Start menu not only there in Windows 8
but better than it ever was before and
more customizable that way you get the
benefits of all the touch features of
Windows 8 like swiping in in order to do
a search or multitasking between
applications like this with all the
benefits of previous editions of Windows
so you guys saw me fire up Angry Birds
there yes
Windows 8 is great as a casual gaming
experience you can get games from the
Windows Store you can install regular
games that run in touchscreen but it's
not just about the casual gaming
experience that your kids are going to
want to enjoy or whatever else I mean
it's cool having a big touchscreen like
this basically means you've got like a
gigantic tablet that lives on your desk
very neat but you can use the other
multitasking feature here so we're going
to open up the desktop all the major
online gaming store platforms steam you
play an origin I'll run just fine on
Windows 8 and not only that but we
observed some tangible performance
differences between Windows 7 and
Windows 8 due in part to the fact that
Windows 8 uses less resources than
Windows 7 on your system and actually
handles the way that core scheduling
works on the CPU a little bit more
efficiently in some cases as well so
battlefield 3 was an example where it
ran about the same in our lab three
percent improvement over Windows 7 for
Windows 8 but we'll call that margin of
error we'll call that the same dirt3 was
one example where we found that Windows
8 performed 10% less than Windows 7
however in Far Cry 3 windows 8 performed
32 percent better than Windows 7 and in
the Elder Scrolls 5 it was about three
percent better
so in general we saw more improvements
than we saw performance decreases or
it's the same so while Windows 8 might
be criticized by some gamers as not
optimal for hardcore gaming necessary
really that is actually not the
experience we had at all once you get
around a couple of little finicky things
make sure games for Windows Live is
installed before you try to run any of
your games and make sure you got the
latest drivers I mean it's pretty basic
stuff beyond that went games for Windows
Live tip so whether or not you feel that
touch belongs on the desktop or whether
it should stick to tablets and notebooks
and phones and all those other devices
you gotta admit the idea that you can go
between playing jetpack Joyride on your
23 inch 1080p screen and then switching
out and enjoying content on said screen
or even going and playing a
quote-unquote real game is pretty darn
cool I hope you guys have really enjoyed
this ultimate build guide for our $1500
recommended system and I'd love to hear
your feedback post under the video and
let us know what did you think you could
have improved with a $1,500 budget and
do you really think that with a
touchscreen you still need to be
investing in high-end gaming grade
peripherals such as the ones that we've
chosen here today we're going to close
out the video with some glamour footage
of our finished system and I hope to see
you guys next time
in our yes there will be more of these
next build guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
