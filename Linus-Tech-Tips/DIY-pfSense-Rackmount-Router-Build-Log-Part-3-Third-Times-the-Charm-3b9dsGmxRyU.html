through sickness and in health
something-something we make videos every
day and sometimes when our teleprompter
mysteriously goes missing you make a
different video than we were planning on
doing today so while I was going to
review the rog swift PG 279 Q instead I
am taking yet another shocked yes my
friends yet another shot at building my
own pfSense router this time with a
chassis that a isn't 1u because that was
way more of a nightmare than it was
worth and B actually is the correct
width for a server rack is apparently a
known design flaw with the 1u chassis
that we used before that if you put the
lid on it which we used to create like
that cool ducting cooling system for the
CPU heatsink it is well known that it
then does not fit in a rack which would
raise the question what is the point of
a rack mount chassis that doesn't fit in
a rack when you close the top of it so
after all that after all the dead boards
or blown it up we're starting again from
scratch hurry up
the mastercase 5 from Coolermaster lets
you truly make your mid tower PC case
your own with a variety of modular parts
and accessories check out the link in
the video description to learn more this
computer is gonna go together just like
that there will be no problems alright
so let's do a rundown of the new
hardware so for our chassis we went with
an AI star us ad 200 LS II the reason I
chose this is for a couple of reasons
number one I think it looks super cool
with like these blue things on the front
number 2 we didn't need a ton of drive
space because it's a router so we didn't
need anything with like you know front
hot-swap rails or anything like that
and number three I wanted something that
was able to mount our expansion cards
rotated 90 degrees so that we could use
full height expansion cards if we wanted
to even in a 2-u chassis so just like
last time we've gone with a redundant
power supply this time it's a different
size obviously to go with the chassis
that we have so this is a 500 watt
redundant power supply meaning that
either of these two power supply units
could fail out right let me be able to
slide it out keeping the system
operating and put a new replacement unit
in this is pretty important for any kind
of mission-critical machine something
like a router where the entire company
literally shuts down if it's not working
for you know 10 minutes and I mounted it
upside down ah I do these things to
myself add
ah yeah good on the subject of
reliability we opted for server grade
Hardware this time across the board so
we've got a p9 ve / 4 L motherboard 4
masseuse the reason this one was chosen
was we could have gone with an M ATX
board quite easily but our chassis has
room for an ATX this gives me the
flexibility to do something else with
the board in the future if I so desire
and the main reason right there for
Intel gigabit NICs built-in that'll give
us a total with our 2 expansion cards so
one of which is an i3 for TT 4 so
that'll give us a total of eight gigabit
rj45 ports then we actually have another
card here though this is an i3 50 based
SFP card so this is also a gigabit 4
part card but this one we're going to be
using for the uplink from our modem
essentially are like our fibre modem so
that will give us a total of 12 ports
using those 2 expansion slots at the
back for our CPU we've gone with a
low-power Xeon it's a 1265 lv3
and then for our boot drive we are going
to be using an old SSD that I had lying
around it beats a thumb drive but it
won't matter anyway because I'm looking
at running the embedded version of PF
sense so we're not going to have to
worry about a bunch of writes on the
disk either way for ram we're going to
go grab some kingston ECC Ram
off-the-shelf and throw that in alright
so the machine is built it was a tight
fit with that PCI Express ribbon cable
and that bottom network card at is it is
still unclear to me if all of this biz
in here is is definitely going to work
but one way or the other it is time to
find out if this system posts so come
along with me for a little journey ok
powers on it's a good side Hey
now the monitors not on that won't help
what is this monitor doing get in there
come on baby yes okay so the machine is
built the machine is posted we're in the
BIOS it's working now seems like a good
time to address the comment that I'm
sure many of you have already left under
the video yes I know this is an overkill
machine I get it
it's way overpowered for a router the
reality of it is the manufacturer sent
us this stuff the only piece that I
provided was actually the low-power Xeon
CPU so do I have a badass router the
answer is yes do you watch - tech tips
for like just good enough the answer is
maybe but either way we're going to
overkill on this one so now we're going
to get into how to actually install
pfSense
on your machine so you head over to the
pfSense website you download whichever
is the appropriate version for what
you're doing so in this case we really
could go with either the embedded or the
full install with the full install being
more heavy-handed on our SSD especially
if we enable things like logging for
example then once you go through the
pretty straightforward setup process
that we're going to show kind of quick
on screen here you are landed at a
prompt that shows you the IP through
which your router can now be accessed on
your local network and from this point
on you pretty much never have a reason
to look at the display output from your
router box ever again because everything
will be managed through the web UI all
right so now that we've mostly got
things sorted out we've decided we're
just going to go for gold we're going to
rip our cisco router out we're going to
put our pfsense router right back in and
were going to finish the configuration
wizard with that all happening
garbage-can router
this is Mel Begley of burning in here to
you the smell like burning yeah
everything seems to be working
alright I'm just throwing this up on the
top for now and then once we've
determined that it functions then we'll
put it then we'll put it into this spot
in the rack so let's get some power run
up here and then let's see if everyone
is ready to go so there will be a
network outage oh for hopefully about
fifteen to twenty minutes okay okay
this always makes me so nervous that is
everything it'll probably take me 20
minutes so off my dish to this coffee
don't put that camera on me it's making
me nervous this is it here we go so I
have informed everyone the network's
going down let's uh let's boot up the
pfSense box and hope for the best
what the heck how did I end up with two
keyboards plugged in okay it's working I
think sometimes it's hard to be me okay
do I sort of be lens right now no enter
Oh an interface or a for auto detection
here goes
no link-up detected let's try one of the
other ones yeah but there's no link up
okay well I'm calling the tech okay I
think it's yeah it's number two oh it's
definitely not in my server room so I
have an MRV in my server room would it
help if I just sent you a picture of
what I'm looking at I'm at the main menu
so here it is guys our overkill router
is finally working there were a number
of issues it seems mostly related to our
fiber media that were causing ports to
not show that the link was up or show
that it was what it wasn't when actually
the setup process for this is as simple
as you sit there at the console you type
in the interface that corresponds to
your internet connection the interface
that corresponds to the switch that goes
out to the rest of your internal network
and you can tell everything else okay
full auto I'm ready to rock you put in
an IP address which it just lists on the
console you get into here there's a
wizard should be pretty much good to go
we had some issues don't worry too much
about that basically the reason we're
running pfSense is we want a nice
high-performance router we want
something that has a GUI so you can
actually get in here and you can
configure all kinds of different
firewall stuff all kinds of different
port forwarding you can actually set up
some really cool features like when I
was using back at our old office when I
was trying to figure out who the heck
was using up all the freaking bandwidth
cap so you can actually get cool little
plugins that will do things like monitor
which IP addresses are sucking up all
the bandwidth just a great little piece
of kit and I'm sorry it's taking us so
long to get it set up but that's in a
nutshell why we went with pfSense for
this box finally finally finally
managing to actually install it so we've
actually got a giveaway to announce for
you guys no it's not a router it's
actually a little bit cooler this is the
zotac magnus en 970 and while it
unfortunately doesn't have a gtx 970
graphics card in it it is still pretty
darn impressive with Core i5 5200 you
dual-core hyper threaded processor two
slots for two and a half inch tribe's
1m2 slot as well as up to 16 gigs of
ddr3 l memory support now the graphics
card that it is using is a gtx 960 and
all of this is packed into a super tight
little device so
