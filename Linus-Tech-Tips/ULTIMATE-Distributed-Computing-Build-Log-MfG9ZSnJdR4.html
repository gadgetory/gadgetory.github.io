welcome to the ultimate distributed
computing build log we do tons of build
logs and build guides that are mostly
not entirely but mostly for people
building gaming PC's and trust me this
computer will rock games this bill blog
however will have a bit of a different
tune to it the idea of this build is for
it to be a distributed computing
powerhouse for folding at home and boink
but before we get into the build itself
I'm sure some of you are wondering what
folding at home and boink even are both
of these programs are largely trying to
answer questions or solve various
problems that are negatively affecting
many people in the world today folding
at home is focusing on Alzheimer's
disease Huntington's and Parkinson's
amongst many other different forms of
cancer boink also looks to research
cures for various diseases but has
options for other projects as well like
discovering pulsars working on
mathematical proofs and many many more
these programs are able to work on these
various interesting projects by
distributing the workload amongst many
users those users computers are
essentially donating their performance
and their houses power to accomplish
great things this whole build will be
about pushing the limits and the CPU was
no exception the core i7 59 60 x8 core
Extreme Edition processor from Intel is
the best of the best of any enthusiast
grade chips available today so I went
with that both these programs can run on
basically any semi modern desktop
processor but this is an ultimate build
so Extreme Edition it is now we could
have fairly easily chosen any x99
motherboard but when a soos heard what
we were planning they wanted to step up
and at a rock-solid way they did the
heart-touching a suits republic of
gamers rampage 5 extreme x99 motherboard
is one hell of a hookup and it fits this
build in a multitude of ways first up it
looks fantastic in a black and red
aesthetic that will match the rest of
the build it has a sexy Republic of
gamers LED in the middle of the board
and a nice IO cover that will look great
along with the black PCB that we've come
to expect from Republic of gamers boards
second and I guess arguably more
important is the board stability this
board has quality components everywhere
and wonderful copper based heat pipes
under those
active heatsinks it's one hell of a
board is it overkill yes definitely for
our case we'll be using the newly
released
noctus 450 which appears to be a wicked
mix between the H 440 and the NZXT
phantom line of cases the outer
aesthetic of this case uses a mixture of
aggressive lines solid panels and
meshing to create a performance look
it also features under glow lighting
which you would normally have to mod in
yourself a great touch now it's probably
a good time to point out that there are
two different versions of the noctus 451
in black and red that I chose and
another in blue and white if you want a
different color palette than I did
venturing through the trapezium or
trapezoid side panel we reveal what
appears to be the inside of an H 440
this is an octa series case not a hush
series case so rather than including
noise dampening foam as they did with
the H 440 they added in a treat for the
more raw performance minded folks out
there by upgrading the fan controller to
an awesome PWM controlled module this is
where things started to get really fun I
couldn't exactly pass up a soos on their
awesome motherboard offer but as you can
probably tell this is an ITX
em ATX and ATX case and the board is
definitely extended ATX back to the
drawing board Yusei know we can make
this work here at Linus Media Group
finding solutions to problems that most
people would simply avoid entirely is a
daily occurrence with barely a second
thought I decided to just go for it the
case does angle up on the right side
before the board ends but not actually
enough to make it actually Bend so full
speed ahead the board does touch the
rubber grommets and ultimately cover
them up which is a shame because they
definitely would come in handy for cable
management but not the end of the world
because I could just wrote my cables
through the nicely spaced to drive cages
for cooling I installed the two by 140
millimeter NZXT Kraken X 61 the N 450
can fit up to three by 120 millimeter
coolers or a 2 by 140 millimeter cooler
now I know the white fans that come with
the X 61 kind of hurt the overall
aesthetic but never fear they'll be
hidden by the top panel once installed
the tubing for the cooler conflicting
with the shroud on the motherboards i/o
did cause a bit of a tight fit
never fear again the install worked out
just fine without the need for any
modifications folding at home and boink
don't really seem to care much about
what Ram they have so we didn't go quite
to the overkill level in this area if we
were building this PC solely for the
purpose of distributed computing even
eight gigabytes of RAM would have been
enough but we wanted 16 gigabytes of
HyperX fury ddr4 modules which should
have us covered for a wider range of
tasks for the power supply NZXT hooked
us up again with a 1200 watt Hale 90 v2
which will ensure that we won't run out
of power even under a pretty heavy load
the power supply slides into the back of
the case after being attached to the
thumb screw based support bracket
similar to how you install a power
supply on an h4 40 again the power
supply is white which doesn't quite go
with our theme aesthetic but it hides
under the fantastic included basement in
the case so it's not really a big deal
since folding a blank really don't need
much in the way of storage capacity or
speed it's common for these machines
dedicated to these tasks to have fairly
non impressive storage solutions we went
with a solution that would hold many a
gamers library 2 of these 960 gigabyte
SSDs from Kingston that Linus had on
hand for an upcoming server project that
he's working on if you're building a
dedicated rig for folding or blank don't
worry about your drive so much but if
you do plan on doing other things with
your computer like gaming or using it as
a workstation PC a fast system drive is
awesome now the graphics cards for this
system are really fun a soos us
up again with a beast matrix 290x which
features some sick
looking black heat pipes and will just
generally look great amongst all the
other black and red components in this
build while doing extremely well for
distributed computing projects next up
is the Titan X now I know I know
obviously I can't link these two
together but boink has different
projects that work for either CUDA on
the nvidia side or cal on the AMD side
and while the rest of the build is so
insanely overkill it felt like a shame
to limit to one or the other so I said
to myself why not both now the Titan X
is sure to crush through projects as
well but it has that crazy green on the
side which just will not do I'll think
of ways to fix this
in a simple and slightly ridiculous way
as the linus media group style I noticed
some of Brandon's gaffers tape was a
similar color to the black on the tight
necks after cutting a strip to size and
trying to get the angles right it looked
pretty cool but not quite 100% there I
took some of the black spray-paint that
Linus had left over from a previous mod
that Brandon had suggested to me and
decided to use the gaffers tape like
reverse painters tape painting the
gaffers tape to be black instead of gray
and then placed it back on the card I
definitely wouldn't say that it's a
perfect solution but honestly for an
inexpensive and easy to implement
solution it looks really good and isn't
even necessarily recognizable if you
aren't looking for it then all that was
left was just to plug everything in that
wasn't already plugged in and quickly
touch up the cable management mostly by
shoving everything I could into the
basement compartment and then strapping
down whatever I couldn't shove into
there with some of the many zip tie
loops on the back of the motherboard
tray now we're up and running
I installed Windows really quick on our
raid 0 the machine looks beautiful and
it's time to get started contributing to
some projects I'd like to note that I
didn't overclock anything on the system
this may change however and I don't
recommend anything against overclocking
especially when you're contributing to
projects like folding at home and wank
but it is also very important to note
that you should be careful when setting
up a system like this as I plan to run
this setup full bore 24/7 sometimes when
people verify over clocks they're fairly
lazy about it and will often test things
for 10 or 30 minutes if you plan to have
a setup like this I would be as thorough
as possible verify that overclock for at
least 24 hours first up we have folding
at home which happens to be the biggest
distributed computing team for Linus
tech tips currently sitting in 25th
place overall four points fourth place
for current active users and has amassed
over 3,500 users in just over two years
Bravo guys Bravo we are one of the
fastest growing folding teams in the
world and it's damn impressive now to
set up folding at home in a simple and
quite easy way simply download your
respective installer install it by
spamming next and away you go
the problem with this however is that
there may be some residual issues from
not configuring it properly as you can
see with my 290x and tight necks they're
happily running away doing your thing
but on
on the left hand side you can see that
our 290 X for example is running at
about high 80 percents in terms of load
and coming in at about 83 degrees
Celsius that seems pretty good but it's
not as fast as the card can go and I
expect more out of it than that
but the issues do not stop there our 59
60 X has failed its work order and is
not producing any results currently
which is a huge loss to optimize folding
at home you require some configuration
and yes you can just change the folding
power slider that will likely be enough
but you really need to optimize things I
highly suggest you check out the Linus
tech tips forms for tips huh and details
on how to set up folding at home in an
optimal manner and the same is true with
boink flowing at home we'll just pick
protein folding projects for you with
boink you need to sign up for projects
on your own and then get work orders
from those specific projects due to the
sheer amount of things you can do in
boink there's a lot of different
configuration tips so again check them
out on the forum after getting this
machine fully optimized I'll let it run
folding at home for a while before
shifting over to blank and optimizing
again because these projects are better
seen over time I would suggest that you
check out the progress links in the
description to see just how my machine
and the team as a whole are doing there
are parts in here that need to go into
future projects so unfortunately this
machine won't be running forever but
I'll try to get some serious work done
with it while I can
thanks for watching the ultimate
distributed computing build bug I hope
you can enjoy some of the glam of this
awesome looking black and red disease
and various world problem fighting
machine as always links to everyone
involved especially our title sponsor
NZXT for making this build possible be
sure to check out the pricing and
discussion thread in the link in the
video description if you're interested
in where you can pick up the noctus 450
case as well as all the other parts we
used in this build thanks for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
