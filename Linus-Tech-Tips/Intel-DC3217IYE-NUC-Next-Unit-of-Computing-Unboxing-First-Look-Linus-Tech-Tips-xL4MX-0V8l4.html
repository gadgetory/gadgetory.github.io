the Nook this is the next unit of
computing and we'll have to check with
Intel to clarify what exactly a unit of
computing is um I think they might mean
like like a form factor or like I don't
know like a you know thin client or you
know I don't know what I don't know
where they go
you have got to be freaking kidding me
okay hold on check this out check this
out you open the box as a as an unboxer
I gotta say I already love this thing
that's awesome okay let's start with the
outside of the box so before we get too
far ahead of ourselves so this is the DC
three two one seven I ye there are two
actually different ones one has a red
top and it comes with a thunderbolt
connector as well as another mini PCIe
port inside it is superior okay stop it
processing and graphics stunningly small
form-factor advanced technology runs an
Intel Core i3 on a very very very small
form-factor stunningly small even
advanced technology there's a lot of
repetition on this box it does have wide
I wireless display and has anti-theft
technology so it's basically like an
ultrabook or something except even like
way freaking smaller actually to be to
be sort of perfect on so feels good too
I was expecting it to be sort of
plasticky and cheap but it's not it's uh
it's actually made of aluminum around
the outside here just a very beautiful
anodized aluminum finish we'll get more
to the unit itself in a moment here so
it comes with a core i3 sticker that you
can put on if you really feel you know
that makes you feel good about stuff
comes with an installation guide so not
everything is included you'll actually
need at least four pieces in order to
get this baby up and running so there's
a full you know picture guide of how to
do everything but we're going to do a
video guide for NCIX on the NCIX tech
tips channel i in the near future anyway
so if you don't feel like using a
picture guide you can use that comes
with a visa mount so that'll allow you
to mount it to the back of the TV or
monitor or whatever else like this would
be great for digital signage
applications there's those screws that
you need for the vase amount and there's
the box you can see it got a little bit
beat up in shipping but it's better than
the box take the damage then the actual
thing itself oh for cats oh I saw
something else in the package there
that's the sensor for the pom pom pom
pom I think I'm pretty pretty sure
that's okay now it's gonna be hard to
get open yeah there we go there it is
okay so that brings us to the unit
itself so what the heck is this thing
it is the smallest it is much smaller
than ITX and it is a new standard that
intel really wants to be well that sort
of that next standard for computing
because we've finally gotten to the
point where you can put a reasonably
powerful machine in a form factor like
this run Windows run full spec hardware
and have a decent computing experience
this is even smaller than a Mac Mini
guys so I'm going to do my obligatory
iPhone comparison because with anything
small we got to whip up the iPhone the
length and width is actually looks like
less than an iPhone 4 check the arm okay
the width is almost exactly like an
iPhone 4 and then in terms of size it's
about sort of two iPhones thickness wise
I think you've already had a pretty good
look at that so this thing is just tiny
on the back you've got two ventilation
holes a Kensington lock Gigabit Ethernet
dual HDMI two USB 2.0 ports I believe
the upgraded version also has USB 3
you've got DC in so it comes with the
power brick that you need however
curiously enough it doesn't come with
the with the wired cord so you'll have
to source one of those you might or may
not have one lying around from just a
random notebook that you used to have or
anything like that
another front USB 2.0 port and then I
think the next thing for us to do is
actually show you guys what you need to
get it up and running so you you're
going to need it has two sodium's slots
inside so you can install up to 16 gigs
of memory so we're going to be using
some crucial Ram
AB for for our upgrade guide and then
it's also got an N SATA slot so you can
install an M SATA SSD so we'll be using
a crucial M for 128 gig SSD and finally
this is optional
you can install a wireless card just
using mini pcie
and yeah otherwise you can just use the
wired connection so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the DC 3 2 1 7 iy II nook the little
tiny tiny computer from Intel see more
ventilation holes at the bottom there's
the screws to open it up don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and I did screw something up guys
the upgraded version doesn't have USB 3
so sorry about that but it does have
Thunderbolt whereas this one has dual
HDMI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
