to be experimenting with something
completely new for me I am going to be
shooting it at myself for one thing and
for number 2 i'm actually going to try
editing something and i'm going to be
using Windows Movie Maker and we'll see
how epic fail this is but the thing I'm
going to be unboxing today is the Primo
chill typhoon 3 this is a totally
self-indulgent unboxing because I want
to see this thing in person it's a
water-cooling reservoir so if you're not
interested in water cooling turn it off
now but if you are stay tuned because
this water cooling reservoir actually
can have a pump attached directly to it
so it is both an aftermarket pump top as
well as a res okay so let's get on with
this I'm going to open up the plastic
here now what's actually really unique
about the type in three is that besides
being a reservoir which it's a dual Bay
reservoir sits in the front of your case
it also according to promote chill
dramatically improves the performance of
your d5 or mcp 655 pump now the way it
does this is rather counterintuitive
because what it does is it actually
allows you to take your pump and split
it so that it can run two separate loops
at the same time so I'll explain how
that works in a minute but first let's
have a look at what's included first of
all you got a couple of LEDs here with a
molex powered connector I not sure what
color they are but there they are
they're actually black wires which is
really nice to see because they're a lot
easier to hide then then white ones are
red and yellow ones or whatever else we
have some of these clear compression
fittings and these are not something
that I think I'd really use myself but
there they are there there if you want
to use them i think it comes with half
inch or three-eighths inch and then
let's see what do we have here here are
four mounting screws okay we got some
mounting screws awesome and then we also
have some stop fittings and you get both
metal and plastic options for these so
it comes with a couple of plateau stops
as well as some plastic stuff now for
stop fittings I have no problem using a
plastic one oh yeah you can see the
plastic ones are actually set up to
the LED inside so that's where you do
your lighting from okay that's pretty
cool all right let's see what else we
got in here for accessories we've got
yes these were the three-eighths
compressions and then you have four half
inch compression fittings again the
plastic chemo chill ones ok here is the
mounting hardware for mounting the mCP
655 or d5 pump on to the res itself you
got a nice big o ring you got some
heavy-duty looking screws as well as
they include the allen key that you need
that's really nice because I mean who
keeps allen keys of every particular
size around at all times I mean I do but
not everyone does so let's take the
typhoon 3 out of its protective phony
wrapping here it's kind of wake up sort
of a random packing job that's done but
it looks protective enough and there's a
nice big layer of of nothing around this
product so it won't get damaged in
transit so here is what the typhoon 3
will look like from the front of the
case now you can see these group this
groove down the middle of it that is
actually for filling it the way the
typhoon three works is once you've got
your loop all set up you actually pour
water into this groove in the top it
goes down the two holes on the front and
then you actually use the metal fittings
to stop up those holes so you'd have to
tip the system back onto its back in
order to fill it it's a little bit
inconvenient from what I've heard but
it's a very effective way of doing it
and maintaining that sleek look so that
you don't have to pull stuff out of the
front i think it was also a bit of a
manufacturing limitation that's the best
way that they were able to do it without
making it so that you couldn't push the
reservoir in and out because you had
that fittings on the top now here we go
this is the back so this is where the d5
or MTP 655 pump goes in and you can see
they thought they've engineered the way
that the pump is actually going to be
moving the water around and the reason
that they've done that is this okay you
see you've got two outlets and two
inlets so that means you can actually
run two separate loops off one pump and
the way that they achieve that is by the
efficient
see they're able to achieve with this
top and with so little restriction
because that's what this does it reduces
the restriction they're able to make the
pump perform more efficiently just by
using the typhoon 3 so you've got
threaded metal metal receptacles for the
pump screws those heavy duty ones I
showed you before that go in here and I
think that pretty much wraps up my quick
look at the dual five and a quarter inch
Bay reservoir thank you for checking out
