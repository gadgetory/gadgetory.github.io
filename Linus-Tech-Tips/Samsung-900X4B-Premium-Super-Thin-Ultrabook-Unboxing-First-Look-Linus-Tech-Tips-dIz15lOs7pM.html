that's been through the war zone a
little bit however the internal carton
is not in rough shape but we do need
this outside one so we can just cover
the specs so this is the Samsung 900 x 4
B this is an ultrabook but it is a 15
inch led-backlit 400 nits non-glossy
display where Samsung is also claiming a
170 degree viewing angle so this is a
very premium ultrabook this is in there
nine series so you know it's not going
to come cheap it comes with a dual core
i5 which can turbo up to two point three
gigahertz it also has eight gigs of
memory at 128 gig SSD and all your usual
wireless connectivity including
wireless-n Bluetooth and wide eye or
wireless display so here's the internal
carton which uses a nice matte black
finish and silver samsung series 9
lettering you got like the rainbow
reflective thingamajig ok let's open it
up inside we find a power cable I know
but this has been on box before I
apologize guys I'm rhian boxing this
particular product see what we got here
probably some manuals and driver disks
and who a microfiber cloth you never
have enough of these system recovery
media ok get started guide of like
Windows or Google you can just use
Google to research how to use Microsoft
products because their best of friends
these days ah users guide essential
guide ok there we go go ahead and put
all that back in there we are pretty
much done with the documentation it has
a one year warranty and it comes with a
little depth or what's this guy for em
or there we go so that is oh okay it's
just a micro USB to ethernet adapter
it's nice that it comes with that
because some laptop manufacturers make
you buy the adapter for the for the
low-profile ports which i think is sort
of ludicrous if you're going to build
the port into the laptop you might as
well make
I can use it we have wow look at that
that is a very very sleek power brick
and check that out that's a Windows khoa
I haven't seen one like that before it's
on the power brick itself instead of on
the laptop Wow interesting okay slick
apparently thinks that's not a very good
idea um I'm sort of with them on that
one because the power brick is a lot
easier to lose and not lose the laptop
and than it is to lose a laptop and like
still need your code for something so um
anyway it is ah yes so now we get into
the not API mean check this out we have
to do the iphone comparison because when
we have something that is as slim and
sleek as this check that out so it is
only point 58 inches thin at the edge
that's the reason for needing the
low-profile port for the for wired
networking because there just isn't
enough room to build in a full-size rj45
port on this notebook over what was it
over 30,000 hours that is labor hours
nan hours went into the design of the
aluminum unibody shell that Samsung is
using for this notebook now this is a 15
inch notebook which means that in spite
of the fact that you are using an
ultrabook you are not going to be
limited in terms of your screen real
estate or your resolution it uses a 1600
x 900 screen and as i mentioned before
it is a high brightness here we go so
we'll show you the actually let's wait
till it gets booted up although samsung
claims it boots up in less than 15
seconds which i think we're pretty much
can we can say is verified now check
that out that was the entire boot time
from from start to finish wow that's
actually really cool so I'd say the the
side-by-side viewing angle is
significantly better than the up-down
viewing angle however screen overall
looks pretty good and my see did I say
the resolution already yeah 1600 x 900
okay so it's a 15-inch 1600 x 900 is
extremely thin so we're going to do the
iphone comparison here again just to
show you guys how skinny the top of this
notebook is the overall builder that
though feels excellent like you guys can
see that in spite of it
then this here I'll show you how much
flex there is to the design almost
nothing here and then on the keyboard
itself I mean I can't I can't do almost
anything a plastic shell like triple the
thickness of this one wouldn't have that
kind of rigidity even if it's a really
well designed one the keyboard uses a
chiclet style and this is not a
bilingual keyboard although if you buy
it in Canada i SPECT there's a I suspect
there's a chance he'll you'll get a
bilingual keyboard you've got a very
very large touchpad so that's really
nice to see ya I guess stuffs I mean
what else is there to really say a
ventilation holes are here there's your
cooling fan although it's not even
spinning right now well there's one fan
spinning in there somewhere but it's
incredibly quiet right okay so here
let's let's finish let's show okay
remember and I own all that okay here we
go so on this side we have our power in
as well as USB to headphone microphone
mini HDMI or is that Mike regime that's
micro HDMI I think very small HDMI okay
and there's that network adapter port
dudette there's a microphone in so it
actually has a built-in microphone for
you know webcamming it up as your webcam
don't worry trust me it's tech two USB
3.0 ports as well as hold on
sorry guys yep that is a VGA out so
you'll will need an adapter for that one
also we have an SD card reader that's
night kind of nice full-size SD card
reader under a little flap here so I
just want to make a few comments on the
overall build quality of the notebook
this is significantly better than the
other two ultrabooks that we took a look
at on my NCIX tech tips channel the
zenbook as well as the macbook air it
just feels really really really solid
the hinge feels good too i mean i can
with confidence hold up this notebook by
the edges here and kind of swing things
around like it feels incredibly strong
considering the petite form factor that
we're dealing with here i mean remember
guys the electronics can keep getting
smaller and more efficient and more
miniaturized but when it comes to you
know building hinges that are durable
the technology is just like you just
have to spend a bunch money on the
materials there's no there's no magic
bullet where like you can refine the
manufacturing process and make the
transistor smaller so it's you know
easier to build a durable hinge no you
just have to actually build a durable
hinge I think that pretty much wraps it
up thank you for checking out this oh
actually oh no no okay it has an eight
cell battery didn't mention that before
we did mention the specs yeah I think
that pretty much wraps it up so thank
you for checking out this unboxing and
first look at the samsung at the new
Samsung 9 series ultrabook don't forget
