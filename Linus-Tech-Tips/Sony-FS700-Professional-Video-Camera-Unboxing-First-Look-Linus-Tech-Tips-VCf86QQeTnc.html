the sony fs700 camcorder which will be
which will be used for tech tips
purposes this is this is a hole it cost
a lot of money so yes this was something
I legitimately purchased in order for us
to bring you all kinds of higher quality
production values and all kinds of good
sort of stuff let's see what Sony has to
say for themselves on the outside of
this very very boring brown packaging so
here's a bunch of hoo-ha about
trademarks and registered trademarks and
whatnot here's a big warning right on
the top of the box damage to this unit
verifiably verifiably caused by the use
of non info lithium batteries will not
be covered by the warranty when using SD
Class 4 or faster as recommended all
right we've got a super 35 see those X
more whatever that is probably the
sensor in all likelihood it has a 4k
sensor in it that's something of note so
you have to get a firmware upgrade later
on down the line to get 4k support
they're estimating it will cost five
hundred to a thousand dollars which
still makes it a great value for 4k
capture but I think is absolutely
ridiculous
for just charging for firmware that's
not my IT industry roots would would
disagree with that particular approach
so AVC HD is how it captures two cards
however it also has the option of
capturing to HDMI just with using an
HDMI output and a capture card such as
the intensity Pro from black magic which
I also purchased so okay
we have one of those microphone doodads
let's just go ahead and hook it up so
wind blocker let's just okay forget it
I'm not going to be able to open that
you know what open thank you there we go
just a simple phone one phone they're
fascinating interchangeable lens digital
HD vehicle recorder okay operating guide
there you can very short
limited warranty here so labor is for 90
days and parts is 1 year 1 year warranty
on this thing good thing I bought it
with my visa which has an extended
one-year warranty
content management utility ok
interchangeable lens digital HD vo
there's the real manual on a disc hey
way to go Sony and then here's
apparently another one here's an
operating guide sitting the headphone
sound all that kind of good stuff this
is all know this is all English Wow
ok alright what else figure out in here
that night piece I don't know I'm not
much of a camera guy actually diesel is
the one who's going to be showing me how
to use all this stuff so I'm just
excited about the fact that we're going
to have a ok mmm
magnify very cool I'm just excited about
the fact that we're going to have a much
better a much better camera overall and
that someone will be operating it and
that we will be able to bring you better
better overall production values we'll
be able to set like you know depth of
field and stuff like that so that you
know it'll have like kind of that blurry
background and just generally look
better this thing can capture it up to
960 frames per second which is also kind
of cool although it doesn't really
capture any kind of decent quality at
that frame rate and it can only capture
for I think a couple seconds but you can
get some pretty reasonably long captures
at reasonably high quality at as high as
240 FPS which is great for like
slow-motion and the kind of stuff that
we will obviously be playing with if
we're going to be investing this much
into equipment you know you got to make
sure you're using it so it comes with a
microphone okay there's the microphone
that matches that foam condom thing that
goes on top of it right there okay
however we're going to be using a
different mic so we'll be using an ntg-2
and Rohde there you go that one comes
with a 10 year warranty see they
understand how to stand behind an
expensive product with cameras like
eighty five hundred dollars and they
give you a one-year warranty with it
look at all these accessories and
whatnot this is exciting so here's a
battery charger VCR / camera nice love
it and then charging there's a power
adapter for it there's a DC output so
this is all okay so you're either
charging or you're outputting to the
camera / if you have a VCR that runs off
that connector that I guess you can do
that
I guess they mean like video capture
recorder okay this is the lens so
important to be careful with this I'm
not gonna not gonna play around this too
much so it's a kit lens but as far as
kit lenses go my understanding is this
one's actually pretty decent so there's
the little cover for the end piece
looked into getting something that was
not a kit lens but did not end up
wanting to go down that route so here
we've got all of our manual manual
controls for focus as well as for zoom
cool beans uses an email so something to
be aware of guys is you need an adapter
that cost a few hundred dollars if you
want to use anything but a sony native
email lens on this camera that was again
the reason we went with the kit was
because to get anything decent that was
not the kit lens was gonna cost at least
a thousand bucks so so we went that
route here's a microphone holder oh
that's disappointing because I bought
one oh well now we know what else we got
here hmm okay so there's your handpiece
which you can use to zoom as well as
something to do with focus and photo so
you attach that to the camera it's a
very modular design much like the fs100
so there's a lot of pieces and and
gizmos that you can attach to it in
order to customize the experience comes
with a remote say continuing the proud
tradition of cheeseball remotes with
expensive gear that I've seen time and
time again in my years in the in the IT
industry as well as whatever other
industry it just seems to be sort of by
law everyone does that here's a USB
adapter of some sort guessing that's for
pulling footage off the camera here's
strap hopefully there's instructions to
go along with all this and lots of
cables so here's a component adapter
component video out here is just is this
really just RCA cables really I mean if
I got really fs700 I need RCA can look
okay maybe maybe I'm missing something
here sir missing something better
that just seems brain-dead okay here is
another well this looks like the piece
to actually run the camera off of so
there's your your filter as well as your
wire and power adapter so in that case I
have no idea what the point of this is
because that's not even that's not even
the same like anything that's not even
remotely related okay it's okay
diesel we'll be able to figure all this
out it won't matter for me to power
cables for those two pieces for the
battery charger as well to run the
camera another USB cable which I'm sure
there's a point to USB a to mini B which
is somehow different from this USB cable
which I can't identify what that is okay
ah info lithium battery so I'm going to
need a bunch of these I suppose at some
point all right that goes there and now
we are left with a battery cover yeah
we're not interested in that
I don't know that's not a better cut
what is this I don't know it doesn't
matter let's open up the camera Wow big
actually a little bit bigger than I
expected so bearing in mind I know
absolutely nothing I can already tell
this is a lot more baller than the x8n
that we're using to film this it does
come with ND filter so you can use those
to adjust the something to do with the
amount of light that comes through or
something like that that was one of the
reasons we ended up going with the fs700
versus the fs100 you have to get like
little little ND filters to change the
quality of the light and put them over
top with the fs100 where's this one it's
built in we've also got manual controls
for pretty much everything and it's dog
that's a huge advantage over something
like the x8n that we've been using up
till now where everything's done via
touchscreen interface that's extremely
inconvenient the ergonomics on the fs700
are also supposedly quite a bit better
than the fs100 although I've never seen
either of them in person up till now
so here you want to just commit it have
a have a close look at the body here so
I'm not heavy once you throw a lens on
it I guess what's going to add quite a
bit of weight but we've got a new tripod
as well that's going to help us with the
additional the additional weight
requirements that that we have you know
what throw the battery in and see what
happens here right and that's what we do
on this channel right we just sort of
randomly do things and then we hope that
it sort of works so there's an indicator
arrow that yeah that didn't work oh
there we go alright happens if we turn
it on Chiron and it doesn't come charged
oh yes it does there we go and we can
set things like the time zone okay
forget that for now so there we go face
detection last seen in Auto manual mode
mmm lots of cool stuff that I totally
don't understand there's the battery
release button as well there's your
mounting for your tripod actually a wide
variety of different mounting mechanisms
here as well as little rubber feet so it
doesn't go anywhere if you put it down
which is important because it's
expensive
okay headphone monitor so you can
monitor well sound just like that I've
also got HDMI out so this is what I
talked about before where we'll be using
HDMI out to capture to a black magic
card and then this one that's what we're
going to need when when we're doing 4k
out
so that's your HD SDI out which is more
flexible cables lighter weight all these
are good things however there's these
fancy red mirror cables now so this is
what we'll be using for HDMI capture
that you can use 28 AWG wires and still
achieve a 50 foot distance on them so
we'll be running that out of here
wrapping it around an arm to make sure
it doesn't pull too hard on the
connector and going that route so here's
all of your audio controls right here
you control which input and how much and
who and what as well as all wow look at
all these dedicated controls for playing
back I guess they really mean for you to
use this in the field it's got a
beautiful
display on it great viewing angle on
that can you tell from there and is it
just yeah you can't really tell okay
awesome viewing angle on their so they
really mean for you to actually be
reviewing your footage a little bit too
LCD hold okay you can make it yeah yeah
you can make the LCD hold in place where
you can totally release it so that it's
there we go okay some more mounting
pieces mounting points for all kinds of
various accessories and stuff like I
said very modular so you can release
this as well and then put different sort
of adapters and whatnot this is this is
for about something we had it so here we
go this is for this I think no it's not
I had no idea what that's for you know
it'll be so yeah we figured it out there
it's it's for like a flash memory
reporter thing so we put that spacer in
there now also there's your inputs for
for audio one and two just right there
you can change modes from video to photo
I really hope you're not taking photos
with this thing no because that's really
not what it's for and that pretty much
covers it so there's your shoe mounts
for various accessories and whatnot so
we're going to build it and then show
you guys once it's assembled so I think
we've got it assembled now like I said
before we don't really know what we're
doing but you have this camera now so uh
yeah it's bigger than I expected and
yeah we've got the microphone attached
now so we ran that to the to the input
yeah yeah iPhone size comparison of
course so there that's the here I'll put
that there
iPhone can basically be like an output
for this thing or rather of like a
display for this thing so it's huge see
there there's the iPhone again there's
the thickness and yeah so we figured out
what this thing's for it is an eyepiece
it's just a slight magnification and
darkening of the LCD so you can can see
in there if you were you were able to
see in there this doesn't work the zoom
zoom here cuz Sony doesn't have
motorized lenses yet for the email so I
don't know what they were planning to do
with that maybe they'll have it
available as a firmware upgrade for five
hundred a thousand dollars so I think
that pretty much covers it you have to
unblock we have lots more gear down box
here else
Kino Flo lights we've got Manfrotto
tripod you've got right Blackmagic
microphone more Kino Flo lights very
exciting stuff so stay tuned more on
boxes to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
