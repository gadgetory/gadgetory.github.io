brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're kicking things off
here in the a su systems suite with the
transformer book duet TD 300 the first
transforming device that I really see
myself using the transforming
functionality of pretty much on a daily
basis it can handle being a Windows 8.1
notebook or tablet and it can handle
being an Android notebook or tablet and
you can switch between them all very
very quickly and seamlessly in terms of
hardware it can handle an Intel Core i3
i5 or i7 processor it's got 4 gigs of
RAM you can put SSD based storage in the
top well it'll come with that and it
also comes with hard drive based storage
in the keyboard dock itself so that
gives you the best of both worlds and
finally it has a 1080p full HD display
on this particular one although they've
got sort of like a slash on the card so
I think it'll also be available in a
1366 by 768 models so I want to show you
guys how exactly the transformation
works to detach the clamshell all you do
is press the button in the middle this
is actually better than many of the
transformer mechanisms I've seen from
Asus in the past and then you can
reattach it simply by latching it back
in place at which time you'll see the
storage inside the keyboard dock is
detected now to transform between
Windows and Android is actually a bit of
a treat so it only takes about four
seconds you press this little button yes
there is an app for that completely
changing your OS and all of a sudden you
go from Windows 8.1 to Android and you
can imagine Android is going to
absolutely fly on something like a core
i7 processor so then to switch back
between Android and Windows we go ahead
and press the OS switch app and within
about 4 seconds we are back in Windows
8.1 very very cool let's finish this up
with a quick look at what we've got in
terms of i/o on the left hand side we've
got Gigabit Ethernet USB 3 SuperSpeed
and HDMI as well as power in and then on
the right hand side we've got a keyboard
is a keyboard well we've got a USB port
you could technically plug a keyboard
into that as well as a microphone
headphone combo jack
next up we've got the G 750 Jay Z the
unique thing about this notebook is that
it does not come in a box it comes with
a wrapper haha sorry for that anyway it
comes with a core i7 processor it
supports up to two two and a half inch
drive so in the US that'll probably
equate to a large SSD with a large hard
drive although the final specs are not
necessarily available yet particularly
with regards to the graphics card so it
has a next-generation presumably very
high-end to go along with the rest of
the high-end specs graphics card from am
I allowed to say who it's even from yes
it is from Nvidia so I'm sure you guys
can all use your vivid imaginations to
figure out what that's likely to be it
supports up to 32 gigabytes of memory so
it has eight DIMM slots it's got a full
HD display it runs Windows 8.1 it's got
a blu-ray drive and of course it has the
ID that we have come to expect from Asus
gaming notebooks with the business in
the front that is to say your full
layout keyboard including a number pad
nice large trackpad and the party in the
back so that's where you're gonna have
all the cooling including your
ventilation as well as your fans that
keep Asus gaming notebooks particularly
cool running now it's not that thin but
this is a yet another hint about that
graphics card with the kind of graphics
horsepower that this notebook is likely
to have putting it in an extremely thin
form factor might not be possible and if
you're looking for the ultimate in
portable graphics with a 4th gen as well
processor and a fantastic next
generation graphics card this looks like
it should be it next up we're here with
the m8 ETA which may be the ultimate
note-taking tablet for example it
features a 5 megapixel camera on the
back ok now we've seen this before what
it actually has that's a little bit on
the unique side is a quad core Bay Trail
processor it's got 2 gigs of RAM it's
available in 32 gig or 64 gig
configurations it has a 1280 by 800
resolution IPS display and most
importantly of all it has a Wacom
digitizer so that is 1024 levels of
pressure sensitivity and it means that
you can use a passive pen in order to
achieve
said that desirable many levels of
pressure sensitivity so that means you
can draw notes you can write notes you
can take pictures of notes because this
is running on an x86 compatible
architecture it comes now so not only is
it compatible with Microsoft Office it
comes with Microsoft Office so you can
use a Bluetooth keyboard to type your
notes and I think that pretty much oh
yeah love that and it'll like basically
fit into a little sleeve in your
backpack or a large coat pocket thanks
for checking out our coverage of the
Asus system suite don't forget that our
trip to the show is powered by NCI XCOM
your source for great technology
selection and service as well as course
our memory and Western Digital without
our sponsors we would not be able to be
here bringing you guys this content so a
huge thanks to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
