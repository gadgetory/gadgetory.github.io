brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital we're kicking things off
here in the ASA system suite with the
transformer book duet TD 300 the first
transforming device that I really see
myself using the transforming
functionality of pretty much on a daily
basis it can handle being a Windows 8.1
notebook or tablet and it can handle
being an Android notebook or tablet and
you can switch between them all very
very quickly and seamlessly in terms of
hardware it can handle an intel core i3
i5 or i7 processor it's got four gigs of
ram you can put SSD based storage in the
top while it'll come with that and it
also comes with hard drive based storage
in the keyboard dock itself so that
gives you the best of both worlds and
finally it has a 1080p full HD display
on this particular one although they've
got sort of like a slash on the card so
i think it'll also be available in a
1366 x 768 models so I want to show you
guys how exactly the transformation
works to detach the clamshell all you do
is press the button in the middle this
is actually better than many of the
transformer mechanisms I've seen from a
sous in the past and then you can
reattach it simply by latching it back
in place at which time you'll see the
storage inside the keyboard dock is
detected now to transform between
windows and Android is actually a bit of
a treat so it only takes about 4 seconds
you press this little button yes there
is an app for that completely changing
your OS and all of a sudden you go from
Windows 8.1 to Android and you can
imagine Android is going to absolutely
fly on something like a core i7
processor so then to switch back between
Android and Windows we go ahead and
press the OS which app and within about
four seconds we are back in Windows 8.1
very very cool let's finish this up with
a quick look at what we've got in terms
of i/o on the left hand side we've got
gigabit ethernet USB 3 super speed and
HDMI as well as power in and then on the
right hand side we've got a keyboard i
should i say keyboard well we've got a
USB port you could technically plug a
keyboard into that as well as a
microphone headphone combo jack
next up we've got the g 750 jay-z the
unique thing about this notebook is that
it does not come in a box it comes with
a rapper ha sorry for that anyway it
comes with a core i7 processor it
supports up to 22 and a half inch drive
so in the US that'll probably equate to
a large SSD with a large hard drive
although the final specs are not
necessarily available yet particularly
with regards to the graphics card so it
has a next-generation presumably very
high end to go along with the rest of
the high-end specs graphics card from am
I allowed to say who it's even from yes
it is from Nvidia so I'm sure you guys
can all use your vivid imaginations to
figure out what that's likely to be it
supports up to 32 gigabytes of memory so
it has 8 dimm slots it's got a full HD
display it runs windows 8.1 it's got a
blu-ray drive and of course it has the
ID that we have come to expect from asus
gaming notebooks with the business in
the front that is to say your full
layout keyboard including a number pad
nice large trackpad and the party in the
back so that's where you're going to
have all the cooling including your
ventilation as well as your fans that
keep asus gaming notebooks particularly
cool running now it's not that thin but
this is yet another hint about that
graphics card with the kind of graphics
horsepower that this notebook is likely
to have putting it in an extremely thin
form factor might not be possible and if
you're looking for the ultimate in
portable graphics with a 4th gen as well
processor and a fantastic
next-generation graphics card this looks
like it should be hit next up we're here
with the m8 ETA which may be the
ultimate note-taking tablet for example
it features a 5 megapixel camera on the
back ok no we've seen this before what
it actually has that's a little bit on
the unique side is a quad-core bay trail
processor it's got 2 gigs of RAM it's
available in 32 gig or 64 gig
configurations it has a 1280 x 800
resolution IPS display and most
importantly of all it has a Wacom
digitizer so that is 1024 levels of
pressure sensitivity and it means that
you can use a passive pen in order to
achieve
said desirable many levels of pressure
sensitivity so that means you can draw
notes you can write notes you can take
pictures of notes because this is
running on an x86 compatible
architecture it comes now so not only is
it compatible Microsoft Office it comes
with microsoft office so you can use a
bluetooth keyboard to type your notes
and I think that pretty much oh y'all
that knittle like basically fit into a
little sleeve in your backpack or a
large coat pocket thanks for checking
out our coverage of the ASA system sweet
don't forget that our trip to the show
is powered by NCI XCOM your source for
great technology selection and service
as well as course our memory and western
digital without our sponsors we would
not be able to be here bringing you guys
