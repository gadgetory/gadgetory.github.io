there's been a lot of speculation as to
why some people thought it was ten atti
I really hoped that it wasn't too many
desktop cards in the last little while
some people thought it was ten atm
I was in that camp and we were all wrong
it was 1080 1070 and 1062 lat top
without the M nomenclature and for a
good reason
mass drop is currently featuring their
exclusive k7 XX red headphones built by
AKG learn more and purchase one today at
the link the video description down
below nvidia is claiming to have a 20
million user install base for gaming
notebooks that it's increased by 30%
over 2015 alone and that it's 9 X 2 in
the last five years gaming notebooks are
becoming a big deal compared to before
where everyone is just like they're just
really large clunky objects they're
becoming much more streamlined things
like the razor blade which I'm actually
getting my notes off for this video are
actually really really fast and there's
going to be a new one coming out with a
1060 in it and that's impressive
there will be laptops with desktop grade
GTX 1060 s in them that are as thin as
14 millimeters and as light as 4 pounds
and that's coming with more features as
well like more power efficient graphics
which should give you 30% more battery
life over their previous Maxwell
editions and while the thin in light
1060 equipped laptops catered to me you
might want to play with a little bit
more power and that would be fine we saw
a live demo on stage where they
overclocked a 1080 inside of a laptop
got it to like 20 62 megahertz and it
was only at like I think 73 degrees
Celsius something like that we're gonna
have to test this in office and we're
gonna have to compare them against their
desktop equivalents but it is pretty
exciting nonetheless now NVIDIA does
seem to be ditching the M all together
they're just calling them desktop
Edition cards but they are slightly
different what they're going to be
looking for in terms of bidding is going
to be different and in the case of the
1070 the specs are actually different
but invidia is saying that they should
be within 10% of the perceived
performance of their desktop variants
the laptop Edition 1060 has six agree
bytes of memory 1280 CUDA cores and a
sixteen hundred and seventy boost clock
the 1070 is a little weird with eight
gigabytes of memory but 2048 CUDA cores
and 16:45 on the boost clock then the
1080 is more like its desktop Edition
brother with 2560 cuda cores eight
gigabytes of memory and 1733 boost clock
in regards to TDP they wouldn't give us
any actual numbers but what they would
tell us is that the 1060 should be
basically the same TDP as a 970 m the
1070 should be the
GDP is a 980m and on the 1080 should be
the same TDP as a 980 non-m the desktop
class 980 now they'll be equipped with
the dual FET power supply a multi phase
power controllers and some laptops will
come with factory overclocks but do note
that there's no over voltage or under
voltage control at all on the card and
unfortunately we weren't able to play
with overclocking at the event so that
style video will have to come later on
now in terms of tech you get all the
same stuff as the desktop side does
you're going to be able to have ansel in
your games have Nvidia VR works if
you're into that all of these different
graphics cards are VR ready
quote-unquote that will mean more or
less depending on which card you get and
there's been some improvements to gsync
the main one is 120 Hertz so you're
gonna have 120 Hertz 1080p panels and
120 Hertz 1440p panels although we
didn't see any of those today that's
pretty exciting if you're into the high
refresh rate gaming on the go which has
not been a huge thing in the past ok so
I'm back in Canada now and I was able to
sit down and pour over some of the
benchmarking results that I gathered
from the laptops at the event in London
there were two rather unfortunate things
to note here
one is that Nvidia did not allow me to
test any of the laptops that were
equipped with a GTX 1060 this was
frustrating as those were what I was
most excited for the thin and lights no
well the second unfortunate thing is
that the games they allowed us to use
for testing were weird why they had bow
shock infinite and shadow of mordor
there I have no idea giving results of
181 ish frames per second in Bioshock
for the 1080 is sweet but not very
impactful or useful I would have rather
seeing more modern games that actually
could really push the platform and see
what it's capable of
to later does that but it's pretty
cherry pit that being said here's the
performance numbers they were all ran at
1080p due to the resolution limitations
of the Asus laptop and I paired that
with the highest presets I could throw
at it now this wasn't a great comparison
not only was 1080p not a challenge for
either of these cards or laptops as a
whole but the Asus laptop had an i7 6820
HK and the clever had an i7 6700
Desktop Edition processor so it was not
the same on either end but there you go
it's fast sure both myself and the
venerable line is Sebastian himself will
have benchmarking comparisons and
whatnot for you guys in the future as we
get some laptop samples in the office
but that's actually all for now I don't
have a ton to say on those benchmarking
numbers as they're on kind of older not
as relevant games but we can look at the
tomb raider number and know that these
things are going to be quite fast and
I'm very happy that they have desktop
grade graphics in laptops in a full
range instead of just on the 980 it's
just exciting for the future Braintree

you're building a mobile app and
searching for a simple online payment
solution check out Braintree with the

thanks for watching hopefully you like
this video that was in two different
locations if you liked that hit the like
button and get subscribed if you were
like no you're only allowed filming
video in one country at a time it's rude
if you do it in more than one country at
a time hit the dislike button that's
fair I don't really understand the
argument but you could do that if you
want to buy a shirt like this one you
can click the link the video description
down below if you want to buy a product
that it may or may not have mentioned in
this video you click the Amazon link in
the video description down below as well
check out this video which is on the 980
in a laptop that I shot in a third
country so basically whatever I'm just
screwing with you at this point but I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
