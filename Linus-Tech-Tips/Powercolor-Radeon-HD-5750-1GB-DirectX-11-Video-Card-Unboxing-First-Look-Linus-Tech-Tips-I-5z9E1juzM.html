power color Radeon 5750 the reason I
went with this one this is actually for
a little build I'm doing for my parents
they they killed their laptop somehow or
rather I don't question it at a certain
point and they said okay well we want to
go with the desktop this time around so
I said okay and they said well what's
the best thing and you know my sister
wants to run Sims 3 and whatever it is
the kids whatever games it is the kids
play these days you know how it is so I
said okay well your best bet if you're
gonna be running Windows 7 is to go with
something that features DirectX 11
they're not heavy gaming gamers
obviously so we're looking at something
like a fairly low-end video card so the
5750 is the most basic out there in
terms of DirectX 11 video cards and the
reason I went with the power color one
was because it was the best price and
also power color has been doing we've
been making huge strides in the North
American market lately and so they do a
really good job of their support and it
had a $10 mir on it so if i get at the
mir then great another reason i've gone
with this is because if it ever does get
transferred to their media center down
the run down the line which could
potentially happen the 5000 series cards
feature 7.1 audio which they are fully
set up for so I figured hey well if this
is something that we can use later on
even when it's not good for gaming
anymore then great actually I should
show you the quick like feature
breakdown so 128 bit memory interface
PCI Express 249 a meter DirectX 11
stream technology crossfire X of Evo HD
announced unified video decoder 2 for
blu-ray and HD content which is a really
cool feature because it means that the
card will decode your blu-ray content
and then built-in HDMI with 7.1 surround
sound which I already mentioned so it
comes in a fairly plain brown box once
you get inside the retail packaging and
once you open that up you will find a
fairly plain brown box inside the round
box which is not really even a box it's
more like more like an insert there okay
so in terms of accessories we get Wow
nothing no accessories whatsoever with
this card it is there must be a reason
that it was
the least expensive one and I guess
that's it that's okay I have all that
stuff on hand anyway it's not really a
big deal okay you get a quick
installation guide where they show you
how to plug in a 6 pin PCI Express
connector which this card will require
and they show you how do you handle your
graphics card and something like that
okay comes in about eight different
languages
terrific and then we bought the card
itself so I'm not expecting there to be
anything stand out it's about this fifty
seven fifty actually it looks like that
coolers designed by Arctic cooling I'm
guessing right now I'm actually guessing
but it looks like we're using a quite
large diameter fan it looks like an 80
mil fan and it's got a lot of blades so
I'm guessing it's gonna spin quite
slowly and rely more on the static
pressure to keep air flowing through the
aluminum fins okay so you can see here
we've got our standard PCI Express power
connector back here that's a 6-pin
connector as you can see and then you've
got your power delivery circuitry you've
got all the memory is cooled actively by
the fan so if I don't know if you're
gonna be able to see this but if you
look through the fins you can see that's
where the memory chips are so they all
lie directly under where the fan is
blowing down which is really nice to see
I mean memory doesn't really need to be
actively cooled these days but it's
never a bad thing you've got your
standard PCI Express 2.0 interface here
actually I think it's 2.1 but it is kind
of irrelevant and then this is it this
is kind of funny there's a 512 Meg
version or a 1 gig version so you can
see someone's put a little pen mark
right here on the card this is the one
gig version thank you for calling that
up for me guys ok on the back we will
find VGA DVI and HDMI so unlike many
other 5000 series cards we do not have
DisplayPort technology on this card
there you go there's another thing that
I probably should have noticed before
buying it but what are you gonna do
we've got our to crossfire connectors
here and are you looking at those you
can see those huh ok to crossfire
connectors here and then you've got four
more memory modules on the back thank
you for checking out my quick unboxing
of the Radeon 57 50 from power color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
