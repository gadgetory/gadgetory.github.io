ICS four-point-oh smart TV i guess is
what it's called that powered by 0
powered by android look how hard that is
to read if you try and read it upside
down CEO to Claude Eva did the book ok
online video streaming internet browsing
multimedia playback games DLNA
applications all running off a tiny
little stick so it's got an arm cortex 1
gigahertz processor using a Mallee 400
GPU 512 Meg's memory ICS 4.0 for gigs in
an onboard with eight gigs optional
apparently ok microSD expansion up to 32
gigs so up to 1920 x 1080 p and
basically all there is to it there's a
configuration so there's fairly
different colors which seems unnecessary
but this is white all there is to it is
this little thick that plugs in via HDMI
you've got microSD you've got power okay
so that powers it apparently by USB
you've got a USB port which is handy and
then another USB port okay lots of us
can go down here so this will have to be
powered somehow which will presumably be
somehow okay if there's no this is handy
so HDMI extension cable so if there
doesn't happen to be an hdmi port that
is accessible like you know with a huge
honking stick coming out of it then you
could just go like this and sort of like
put it in the back your TV like that so
it's not a perfect experience by any
means but it is running Android 4.0 and
that means that with this that little
dongle plugged into the TV over there so
it's plugged in x HD mine that i found a
random USB port on the TV that evidently
works to provide power we are running
Angry Birds we have a full android OS
going all we had to do was plug into USB
mouse in order to in order to get a
working see i can
aim the guy and then I can like fire the
guy and I can miss with the guy and see
the pigs they think that's hilarious
till today stupid pigs what do pigs know
anyway Ted green what kind of pig is
green you know he thinks it's funny now
down okay so we're going to just go back
make it back to home so you can see so
if I you can scroll from place to place
and and then it what version of Android
is this mmm thanks let's see what
version of Android it is it's a little
laggy I wouldn't mind goes faster 4.4
let's go to youtube let's watch like so
let's search for like don't know yeah
skateboarding accidents because that's
always planned on youtube do-do-do-do-do
this one's got three million views must
be outstanding so we're watching high
quality on the YouTube app we are going
to expand to full screen so if you want
like a little smart TV and a blur kind
of thing and you want to watch people
wipe out on skateboards all this isn't
the high quality video is terrible ok
let's let's search for different
skateboarding accidents let's find
something a little bit newer that's
maybe an HD worst skateboarding accident
ever it's two minutes and 40 seconds
long it must be the worst accident ever
from four years ago slickest giving me a
hard time about picking that one when i
said i was going to look for something
newer and okay you know what maybe we
just shouldn't look it's bam bam so I
think that pretty much concludes our
