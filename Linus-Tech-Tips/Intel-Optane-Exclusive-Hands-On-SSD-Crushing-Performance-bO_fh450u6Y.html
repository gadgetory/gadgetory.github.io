campus and full from California where we
will be taking an exclusive look at the
latest breakthrough in some super
awesome cool tech that they're calling
their Intel octane technology based on
3d crosspoint memory media and all this
was taking place in advance of you
normal consumers being able to buy right
now I think about it that that sounds an
awful lot like all the other coverage of
this stuff but know the difference this
time is that an octane memory module
like the one I'm holding in my hand will
be available for purchase in about a
month for 50 bucks ok so what is an
optin memory module here's a Cliff's
Notes DRAM is the super fast storage
that holds the data that's integral to
whatever it is your system is doing at a
given moment so when you go to launch a
web browser or a game a simulation data
set or video editing program whatever
that is where everything gets kept so
that the program runs smoothly so that's
great right let's just put let's just
put everything in there right wrong
wrong wrong wrong the RAM has two major
limitations the first of which being
that DRAM is very expensive you probably
have less than a tenth as much DRAM in
your system as you have other types of
storage and number two is that DRAM is
what's known as volatile so that means
when the system loses power poof the
data is gone so that is why we have
what's known as non-volatile storage so
this is where your pictures or files or
anything that you don't want to
disappear every time you turn off your
computer goes and the most common types
of non-volatile storage in order of
speed are
the hard disk drive or HDD the
solid-state disk or SSD with SATA
interface or more recently an nvme SSD
like the 750 series right here
getting back to obtain those 3d
crosspoint memory is unlike anything
we've ever seen before at a die level
both its performance and endurance
exceed even the NAND used in the
highest-end FFTs today and perhaps even
more importantly it has only ten times
the access latency as B RAM meaning that
it can be used as more of an extension
of system memory or like a fifth level
of CPU cache and it can do that without
worrying about the write cycle
limitations or long systems stutters for
delays that would be associated with
grabbing data off of a more traditional
storage device and the real kicker then
is this it does all of this stuff while
being non-volatile the data stays there
so here is a normal computer Intel did
provide it but I have checked no monkey
business 7700 k au z 278 they got a
water cooler on there that herp a derp
with the RAM spacing there it's got one
fan on it and you got a here's that GTX
1080 and 3 terabyte WD blue hard drive
so in summary then this small 16 or 32
gig stick sits somewhere between your
ddr4 Ram and your mechanical hard drive
so I'm thinking kind of there but no not
really
acting as a way faster data cache
allowing application launch times and
system responsiveness up to several
times faster and this time Intel claim
although we've all heard this before
that it's easy so
let's try it out then shall we oh action
roll here we go and here's the
performance of a normal computer if you
can call it that I mean I'm not just
talking boot time like click on things
how long you wait well okay so now we're
going to put in the Intel obtain memory
module
let's shut this baby down eventually at
this time that requires a seventh
generation Core series processor and a
200 series desktop motherboard you find
an available m dot 2 slot so here's
where's actually 2 on this motherboard
screw it in and Boop there it is about
3.7 gigabytes per second of theoretical
bandwidth to our memory how awkward
looks like there's no button finally we
reboot and we're actually going to be
measuring this even though we are not
expecting there to be any significant
difference in boot time since the obtain
memory module hasn't had a chance to
catch anything yet and hypothesis
confirmed it is marginally faster but
there's also significant variance once
you factor in waiting for all this crap
to load up when you boot up windows and
for that matter this is true for
everything we ran after initially
installing the obtain memory module on
the second run
now we're talking here octane is
starting to flex its muscles a little
bit game loading times are not affected
as much but boot times and application
load times are noticeably snappier for
our third run ignoring the margin of
error inherent and relying on my fingers
to press the stopwatch overall the
results look pretty darn similar to the
third and still very good
so that was really cool but with that
said I don't think anybody at Intel is
trying to convince the enthusiasts user
who wants to give them $700 for a 1.2
terabyte nvme SSD to throw that junk in
the garbage and run out and buy a big
old hard drive and strap a 16 or 32 gig
octane module to it instead no I think
the pitch here is that in a typical
consumer workload the octane module can
hold enough of the operating system and
program data to achieve SSD like
responsiveness at a lower cost without
manually using frequently used data
around like many users we have SSD boot
drives and HDD storage drives have to
deal with today
so this tech was already capable of
measurable noticeable improvements to
system responsiveness back when it was
called SRT and it used slower lower
endurance NAND flash in order to
accelerate the computing experience so
what we're looking at now then is a way
for Intel to take everything that they
learned about intelligently caching data
for the user and give it the low latency
high endurance and simplicity that it
always I guess needed to really shine so
a huge shout out to Intel for sponsoring
this video bringing us down here to
exclusively bring you this hands-on
experience with their octane memory
module thanks to you guys for watching
and as always if you just liked the
video you know what to do but if you
liked it hit that like button get
subscribed leave a comment letting me
know what do you guys think of this
would you use octane to accelerate a
boot volume would you use it to
accelerate even a secondary storage
volume what do you want to see this
technology and cuz I can tell you this
is not the last we've seen of it and
finally check out at the link in the
video description where to buy the stuff
we featured our merch store and our
community forum LC
is later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
