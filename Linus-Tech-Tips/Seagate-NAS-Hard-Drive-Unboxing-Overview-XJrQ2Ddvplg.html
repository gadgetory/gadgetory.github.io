Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more welcome to my unboxing and
first look haha at a type of packaging
that you'll likely never see so this is
a four pack of Seagate's noon as hard
drive so what is a nas hard drive see it
requires a lot of explanation because
similar to Seagate's competitor who also
has a nasa optimized drive this one has
a very cryptic name that doesn't in any
way imply the function of oh wait no
it's called an as hard okay so it's for
NASA's it's available in a variety of
capacities up to four terabyte which for
a consumer-grade NAS drive is right now
the highest capacity that you can get it
comes with a three-year warranty it uses
a SATA 3 six gigabit per second
interface not that that matters in any
way shape or form because quite frankly
the things that matter for NAS drives
are a couple of things so number one is
vibration tolerance
these ones are optimized for anywhere
from one to five drives in an enclosure
and they are optimized to not be
interfered with by the other drives
around them the next thing is workload
so these are rated for a 24/7 workload
however but not to the same sort of
extent that you'd find on something like
a Seagate constellation ES which is
their their enterprise class drive it's
also designed for quiet operation which
is important if you're using your Nass
or your hard drive enclosure enclosure
hard drive included it's a new thing I
just invented a hard drive enclosure on
something like a desktop and next to
your PC and you don't want to sit around
and listen to it and of course cost is a
factor so as a consumer-grade device
this particular nas drive is not very
expensive performance takes a backseat
with an as hard drive and the reason for
that is because most naz's are going to
be limited not by the performance of the
drives inside but by the performance of
the network interface attached to them
in most cases gigabit which one of these
drives can max out nvm if you go and
chuck like four of them in an enclosure
running in raid 10 which or something
like that or they're going to be held
back by the controller involved which in
most masses is not going to be able to
handle
more than gigabit operation anyway in
something like a raid 5 which is what I
personally would usually run four drives
in as long as I have a controller that's
powerful enough to deliver me at least
you know 40 50 60 megabytes per second
on write speed because there are a lot
of calculations involved raid fives
efficient because it gives you three
drives worth of capacity with only one
drive taken up in terms of redundancy
but it just means more calculation
intensive therefore it is slower thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the Seagate NAS Drive and
hey guys stay tuned because I'm gonna
back up these claims where I'm actually
here first I want you guys to say what
you think am i right or am I wrong about
the whole Maz drives performance doesn't
matter thing because I'm gonna try and
back it up but I've actually got slick
working on a test right now where we're
gonna be using a pretty high-end
Synology nas so 500 $600 for bein as and
we're gonna go Seagate NAS drive versus
WD red 3 terabyte and we're gonna find
out which one performs better stay tuned
