it's time for the usual trappings of the
Christmas season excess spending excess
amounts of eggnog and excess decorative
lighting now for many people this might
just mean grabbing some lights from that
box in the Attic throwing them into an
outlet and draping them over something
but that isn't exactly very fun or
interesting and maybe that's why we've
seen so many smart Christmas lights hit
the market in the last couple of years
but are the options out there good
enough to turn your average tech-heads
house into a veritable Santa's workshop
that you can control in the palm of your
hand well it's time to find out after we
thank Rosewill for sponsoring this video
check out their neon que 85 gaming
keyboard with mechanical switches and
m53 gaming mouse with up to 4000 dpi at
the links below
so we're going to be looking at a few
different options for your high tech
holiday setup with varying feature sets
but all four of them seem to have one
simple idea as an integral part of their
design philosophies having to
continually unplug and replug your
lights every night is a massive pain
especially after going to all the
trouble of setting them up in the first
place especially if your decorating
style reminds the neighbors of Clark
Griswold so just how convenient then did
our contenders make our experience first
up let's have a look at the twinkly
system from Italian concern LED works
and even though the sales rep might give
you a confused look if you walk into the
store and ask for twinkly lights it did
actually come to us on a very handsome
looking not to mention well labeled box
twinkly more than any of the other
products in this video seems designed
specifically with Christmas trees in
mind which is cool because the app will
connect to your phone's camera and will
actually map where each individual LED
bulb is on the tree after you set them
up you'll be able to see this map on
your screen so that you can address each
light individually for granular control
allowing you to draw custom effects onto
the tree unfortunately the apps a little
finicky it couldn't find the light set
way too often and the system was a bit
slow to respond at times so the ability
to create these custom effects is cool
but it's not very intuitive and the set
up was kind of a pain as it didn't
specify that you need to be on the 2.4
gigahertz band when connecting it to
your home network you could use it on
the 5 gigahertz band but only after it
was up and running with all that said
the lights themselves look great they're
plenty bright and the effects really
helped bring jeong's we're actually at
John's house right now
John's tree to life they are a bit
pricey yet a hundred and ten dollars for
a 105 light starter set and that gets
even worse because I would definitely
consider getting an extension if you
really want full coverage of your
tree this one actually needed a second
set of plain old regular lights to
complete the look and at that price
point I would expect better app
implementation but overall this one's
not a bad buy at all on the subject of
underwhelming app support let's take a
look at the lumen play from s4 lights
next unlike twinkly this one connects
via bluetooth 4.0 so you'll need to make
sure your phone is compatible and even
then the app might still cause problems
so it was totally non-responsive on a
nexus 6p running android 8.0 oreo
although we did get it working on
devices using android 7 or iOS 11 with
all that said any app that hasn't been
updated in a while isn't a good sign
physically though the lights themselves
felt heavy-duty and well made and I
wouldn't worry about putting them
outside in the elements but the flipside
is this did make them a little bit
unwieldy and cumbersome for indoor use
especially with the three bulky modules
that we needed for just the 36 lights
that you see in the kitchen here which I
imagine would make them pretty annoying
to try to put on a tree the effects that
you can select look alright though you
can create your own maybe because when
we tried certain patterns of animations
ended up throwing random colors into our
setup so while the lights themselves
aren't bad the very buggy app experience
earns the lumen play a pass from us at a
hundred and sixty dollars for 36 lights
though we set your lights to music
feature actually did work nearly
flawlessly as long as you're playing
something from your phone's local
storage that isn't DRM protected so
that's good if you want to stare at
something other than a Yule Log while
you listen to Christmas carols speaking
of Yule logs there's one product family
with so many lighting options I'm
surprised they haven't released a smart
Yule Log Philips hue which you've
probably seen on display at your local
big box store the cool thing about this
is that they can all be controlled by
this little Wi-Fi puck thing called the
bridge which
you connect to up to 50 different lights
so you'll probably only need one we have
a pair of hue light strips which we
tried running behind some pcs and behind
this couch for a bit of Christmas themed
bias lighting as well as two of the area
effect Hugo's no relation to the French
novelist Philips hue was easily the most
polished experience with a slick
intuitive app interface with very low
latency and that responsiveness is
exactly what you want when you're
dealing with an elaborate lighting setup
also remote access over the internet was
easy to set up and work like a charm the
goal lights aren't super bright but
they're powerful enough to light up a
corner and they have cool features like
three hours of battery life if you want
to move them around or position them
somewhere temporarily during a Christmas
party and the ability to tilt them up on
this little integrated stand to aim them
at your wall Philips does offer another
area effect light called the bloom which
is slightly more powerful but we
couldn't get our hands on that one for
this video the light strips on the other
hand get extremely bright if you just
set them to emit white light and are
actually like I'd say they're bright
enough to really change how your
workspace feels
unfortunately you can only set them to
one color through the native app even if
you have two strips joined together like
we did like the other options hue is
extremely customizable within the app
but this is cool it also features a
large number of third-party apps with
pre-loaded color profiles including
Christmas themed one this setup is a bit
pricey including sixty bucks just for
the control bridge but having a very pro
feeling experience that works almost
without a hitch
makes it at least somewhat easier to
justify but maybe even if you could
afford it it's possible that you already
have like ten thousand bulbs worth of
existing dumb Christmas lights and just
don't see the point of tossing them all
in the garbage well if that sounds like
you you might be interested in something
like the Wemo from Belkin which isn't
really a lighting product at all instead
we moe make smart outlets that plug into
your existing ones
now although they won't suddenly make
the el cheapo lights that you got at the
dollar store customizable and super
fancy they will at least enable control
from your phone and a light scheduled
randomizer in case you're leaving for
the holidays and you want to deter any
winches that are roaming around
we were huge fans of how bulky the plugs
are but that was really the only
complaint setup wasn't hard although
again you'll need to use the 2.4
gigahertz band initially and then you
can control it over 5 gigahertz later
and remote access over the Internet is
enabled by default and worked just fine
the app interface is no-nonsense and the
plug itself actually gives off extremely
satisfying audible click when you turn
your lights on end well that's on but
not off off so you don't have to wonder
whether it worked the fancier insight
switch will also give you a OneTouch
report on power consumption and if you
enter how much your power company
charges you it'll even tell you exactly
how much you're spending on keeping your
house looking like one of those shopping
mall Santa displays the good news is
that while you don't get any actual
lights they are a cheaper option
compared to the other ones we've looked
at at 80 bucks for two switches if you
already owe lights now to be clear none
of the products we've looked at here are
really geared towards those folks who
want to do like crazy custom lighting
setups that require a PC or a Raspberry
Pi to drive them not to mention more
extensive programming but with that said
Hugh does have a public API if you are
into that sort of thing however from
what we've seen for the mainstreamers
out there there are plenty of options
that while not perfect could add a
little bit of fun techy Christmas joy to
your holiday setup if you choose the
right one especially if your aunt's
dancing Santa Claus just isn't cutting
it this year speaking of not cutting it
is your computer case not cutting it be
quiet just released their versatile dark
bass 700 MIDI Tower and to celebrate
they're having a contest it's called the
dark bass 700 character builder you have
to build and config
PC through their site we'll have that
link below for a chance to win that
system or one of eight dark based 700
cases the contest runs from now until
November 29th and the winners will be
announced by be quiet on December 1st so
