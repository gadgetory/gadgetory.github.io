refresh rate monitor that doesn't need
to be overclocked and also happens to
feature g-sync ultra-low motion blur and
3d vision welcome to my review of the
only choice for someone who wants all of
that stuff the asus rog swift PG 2 7 8 q
coolermaster v series semi modular power
supplies feature 80 plus gold efficiency
and their gold guarantee five-year
warranty click now to learn more
Asus was wise to go with an ROG inspired
design for this monitor physically and
ergonomically it hits all the right
notes for a top-of-the-line monitor for
me right now the stand has the full
gamut of adjustments twelve centimeters
of height adjust sixty degrees of swivel
25 degrees of tilt and 90 degree pivot
with a vase amount in the back just in
case none of that is enough for you the
styling is also spot-on with aggressive
rear vents a cable management hole on a
stand a disabled a bowl red LED ring
around the base and that's it no boofie
stuff around the screen itself no touch
of color or whatever nonsense just a
super thin matte black bezel that
ensures that all of your attention is
devoted to the screen where it's
supposed to be even the menu buttons are
actually really good something I wasn't
expecting given how much I disliked the
ones on the PB 287 Q this is the fastest
to navigate on-screen display that I've
ever used I still don't like the rear
shortcut keys because I can't tell which
is which when I can't see them from the
front but the joystick combined with a
super snappy responsive menu is a dream
to use mind you unlike other high-end
monitors the Swift's menu doesn't have a
bunch of options in it like volume
adjust picture-in-picture and the got
whacked ton of inputs to choose from and
when we flip the monitor over at the
back that reveals the reason in the back
you'll find a DC power jack for the
included power brick a DisplayPort 1.2
input and a dual USB 3 port hub that I
really wish was on the base and that's
it because of the g-sync module which
only supports one input this monitor
doesn't have an extra HDMI
input for your game console it doesn't
have weaksauce built-in speakers it
expects you to game on a PC with a
proper pair of headphones or speakers
the way that gay been intended so far if
the product wasn't even good I gotta say
I like its attitude but but does it suck
is it not good no no it doesn't suck
I find that 27-inch displays with a 2560
by 1440 resolution hit that perfect
pixel density sweet spot where the image
looks sharp but screen elements aren't
too small to be usable forcing you to
use windows is still terrible built-in
scaling that causes blurry text in many
applications that combined with the
solid contrast and acceptable color
reproduction makes the monitor good
enough for me to legit use as a daily
driver
something that I haven't been able to
say about any of the 4k Tien monitors
that I've used so far due to their
lackluster contrast and need for scaling
or Ben Q's high-end Excel Series
monitors due to their 1920 by 1080
resolution now to be perfectly clear it
is not flawless switching from the PA to
7 9 q monitor that I use at home too
this was very noticeable contrasting
colors are not as good and viewing
angles while good for TN are still TN
with horizontal color shift being
difficult to notice in day-to-day use
but vertical color shift being very
noticeable especially on white
backgrounds with my head stationary the
top of the screen has a slight green
cast and the bottom does go a little bit
pink but yeah
nothing is perfect and the trade-offs
that you have to do with this monitor
are just part of life and at least
you're getting a lot to like about the
display in return the maximum 144 Hertz
refresh rate and one millisecond rated
response time makes more of a difference
to the perceived responsiveness of your
PC than you'd imagine both inside and
outside of games and along with the
headline G sync feature you get
stereoscopic 3d vision support and UL mb
or ultra low motion blur support along
with other nice touches like the
built-in crosshair overlay although
you're basically a Butthead if you use
that for competitive play and the near
instant power on with no splash screen a
soos I wanted to take a moment to let
you know I noticed
and appreciated the emission of this
entirely unnecessary delay between
pressing the power button and using my
PC thank you all right on to the gaming
experience let's start with a quick
refresh of what g-sync is for those of
you who haven't seen my original
coverage of it here and that was a pun
by the way normally gamers have two
options number one is running without
vsync which causes visual anomalies
called tears whenever a new frame is
output by the graphics card while the
monitor is in the middle of a refresh
almost all games do it but in some it is
especially annoying
number two is to enable vsync where
tearing is eliminated because the
graphics card is forced to wait until
the next fixed interval when the monitor
will refresh to output a frame this
causes stuttering during FPS dips and
for me an intolerable amount of latency
between when I execute an action and
when I see it on screen
I never gain with vsync on g-sync
eliminates the issues associated with
both of these options by letting the
graphics card tell the monitor when to
refresh that means a more responsive
gaming experience without visual
artifacts this is next-level stuff guys
and the experience is truly awesome you
just turn it on in the driver to
override other vsync options and it's
off to the races if you're a gamer and
you want the best monitor on the market
today to play your games this is it
period
I did most of my testing in Tomb Raider
2013 since I happened to be playing that
game right now and even though this
monitor wouldn't be all that suitable
for professional color work using it
recreationally I really didn't feel like
I was having the TN experience the way I
normally do with high refresh rate
monitors in every scene from vibrant
outdoor jungle locations to darkened
tombs where monitors with poor contrast
will make it difficult to make out
details the Swift excelled I also need
some time to fire up a bunch of other
stuff for my Steam library just to try
it out framerate drops below 30fps are
still very noticeable because even with
g-sync on you will experience stutters
when you dip that low but per the
suggestion in the reviewers guide I
actually tried using GeForce experiences
game settings optimizer for the first
time ever since it's designed to keep
your FPS above 40 by default and
honestly it actually worked pretty well
it made smart decisions for me that
we're similar
what I would have input and while I'm
still going to do it manually because
I'm a control freak it did work
surprisingly well for a quick I don't
feel like dialing in all my games right
now solution so that's it I think this
technology is great and basically
everyone else agrees and over the next
few years
availability of g-sync and competing
solutions will improve and prices will
fall until it's ubiquitous because it's
just plain better than the old way of
doing things but that's all hypothetical
future stuff this is the summer of 2014
and this is the ultimate gaming monitor
if you don't want to wait another year
at least for a gaming experience that is
truly much better than what everyone
else has right now but there's a catch I
did most of my playing on a GTX Titan
and I'd recommend at least a gtx 770 for
medium settings on modern games or at
least one gtx 780 for high in modern
games if you want to take advantage of
the high refresh rate nosov it at 1440p
which combined with the Swift high price
tag makes this a very expensive upgrade
one that's going to be hard to convince
people to invest in you see desync has
to sell itself to gamers based on the
absence of annoying crap that we've all
spent years getting used to and putting
up with rather than by delivering some
shiny new thing for us to drool over it
reminds me of the upgrade to SSD as long
as you're still using a hard drive it
might seem extravagant and unnecessary
to spend that kind of money on something
with so little storage that doesn't
increase FPS directly but then you
eventually take the plunge and once you
get used to it
it drives you bananas whenever someone
puts you in front of a system of a hard
drive in it and that's exactly what
g-sync is like looking at tearing just
feels stupid to me now that this
solution is available even the ultra-low
blur mode which is an official version
of the low persistence backlight
strobing hack that folks have been using
on lite boost monitors just doesn't get
my attention at all it's cool how much
crisper moving images look you can
actually read text while dragging it
across the screen but in-game it wasn't
that noticeable to me and since you have
to pick between that and gsync I'll take
g-sync every time it's a truly next-gen
experience and from what I've seen so
far a Seuss's first product to deliver
this technology to
the market is a slam-dunk even aside
from the fancy technology let's say
you're running an AMD card and you're
not looking to change graphics cards
right now you should still be looking at
this monitor versus the excel 27-24 BenQ
for a higher resolution if you've got
enough shiny pennies to afford it guys
