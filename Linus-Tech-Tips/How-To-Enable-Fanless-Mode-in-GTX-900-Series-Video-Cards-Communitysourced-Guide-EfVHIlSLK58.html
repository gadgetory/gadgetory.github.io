on - tech tips it's our video version of
a guide we found somewhere on the
Internet
oh wait so hold on a second so you're
saying that's not different from what we
normally do oh come on I mean there is
at least a unique spin on it this time
and on the subject of spin if you
haven't checked out empty warehouse
chair racing and subscribe to our other
channel channel super-fun maybe now is
the time
the Coolermaster Nova touch tkl is
powered by Topor hybrid capacitive
switches for the ultimate typing
experience and is now available for a
reduced price click my face to learn
more all right so what's different about
this online guide conversion is that we
are basing the video on content that was
posted on our own website by the user
lays where he or at least I assume he
based on the pitch of his voice but you
never can know demonstrates that you
don't have to buy an asus strix or EVGA
card with a fanless mode to get your gtx
960 a staff excuse I'll entitle or even
in lightweight games so let's start by
addressing the big question that a lot
of people have first why on earth would
you want your fans to turn off they're
not that loud in the first place and
they're just gonna turn back on again
when you fire up any kind of demanding
game or other application anyway get a
good pair of noise-isolating headphones
and call it a day
well that's where you're partially wrong
for one thing perceived loudness is
dependent on the environment in which
the PC is being used and personal
tolerances to you the ambient noise in
the room or the other fans in your
system might overpower the quiet idle
noise of the Nvidia reference or MS ID
Twin Frozr or whatever other cooler you
have on your graphics card but for
people up late writing for example in a
quiet room a nice quiet PC can be pretty
important in us they start replacing
fans in their system they quickly get to
the point where the graphics card fan
one that they have is pretty tough to
replace is the loudest part and to
address the whole get headphones
suggestion I mean not everyone who likes
headphones and why should I have to put
something on my face or just deal with
it when there is literally no reason my
computer should be making any noise when
I'm playing music for example something
that's been possible to do on fanless
low-power portable devices for decades
at this
which leads us to the guide now normally
unless your GPU supports fanless
operation out of the box
your MSI Afterburner custom fan profile
which you can access like this will have
these dotted lines on it to denote the
maximum and minimum values that your fan
will operate at you can drag the button
down to zero rpm but it won't do
anything without the modification posted
by Lai's which will summarize but I'm
sure you'd also appreciate if you check
out the link in the video description
and post some positive comments in the
forum thread if you liked his guide all
right so first you need to gather the
tools you'll need maxwell bios Tweaker
gpu-z
and envy flash save your bios using
gpu-z - a folder of your choice in the
root of your drive we're gonna call it
envy flash by pressing this button copy
all the zipped files from Maxwell BIOS
Tweaker and then B flash and level all
that stuff into the same folder as your
backed up BIOS open the BIOS Tweaker app
open BIOS by clicking here and
navigating to it it should be pretty
close by then there's a bunch of stuff
that you can tweak in here but most of
it goes beyond the scope of this guide
we're just gonna change rpm 11 / 0 1 and
rpm 0 1 to 0 to change the minimum value
in rpm and percentage of our fan to 0
when that's done save your BIOS as some
other file name so you retain a copy of
your original BIOS that you can flash
the card back to so that it's in its
stock configuration in the event that
you ever need to send it in for warranty
service then go into device manager and
disable your graphics card don't worry
if the screen goes black or doesn't
anything funny this is only temporary
next press windows and type command then
right-click and open as administrator
type in CD space C colon backslash n D
flash and press ENTER then type env
splash space - 6 space and the name of
your BIOS dot r om then press Enter
press Y wait for the flash process to
complete I'd actually highly recommend
being connected to a battery backup
during this
time restart re-enable your graphics
card and device manager reboot again for
good measure then fire up MSI
Afterburner and it's off to the races
now you can configure your custom fan
profile however you want so depending on
if you just want silence at idle and
otherwise a pretty normal fan curve or
if you want to be able to you know limit
your GPUs load through the use of vsync
g-sync or some other framerate limiter
in game for example to try and get
silent gaming going you'll want to tune
this differently but this follow-up post
in the forum from lace has a solid
looking suggested curve that ramps up
the fin to keep your GPU safe as it
heats up while keeping it quiet when
nothing is shaken once you've got it
dialed in and you like the GPUs overall
behavior and noise level under various
loads simply put a value between 10 and
15 degrees into the hysteresis box this
keeps the fan from constantly ramping up
and down when the temperature is right
on the threshold of a major rpm shift
which can be annoying and then you're
done so the last things to address in
this video are these - I did this and my
GPU is running at like 60 to 65 degrees
at idle at the desktop is that ok the
answer is pretty much yeah while lower
temperatures are better for electronics
60 degrees is nowhere near the fast and
painful death danger zone and if Nvidia
thought that this was bad for it none of
these cards would feature a fanless mode
what about this one then linus how does
this affect the warranty of my card well
if your GPU manufacturer does not allow
BIOS flashing under the warranty terms
my recommendation would be - like I said
before flash that backup that you saved
back onto the card before attempting to
get any kind of warranty service they
can't tell you did it but with that said
if you were to brick your card as part
of this process the honest thing to do
would be to suck it up since it's not
covered and take better precautions like
using a battery backup next time
speaking of taking better precautions
crunchyroll is a way to take precautions
against missing your
favorite anime shows it's the anime site
created by anime fans for anime fans
they offer the most current episodes of
new shows straight from Japan like
parasite the maxim and Kuroko's
basketball 3 with a large collection of
the most popular anime series like
Naruto and one-piece and all of the
content on their site is professionally
subtitled so all you got to do is head
over to crunchyroll.com
slash Linus you can sign up for a 30 day
free trial of crunchyroll premium which
gives me a whole month a free anime
completely ad free then if you enjoy the
many benefits of premium you know
membership like 1080p streaming getting
new episodes of shows within an hour of
their premiere and being able to stream
anywhere from a variety of devices like
a phone tablet game console you know
your extra sketch actually that doesn't
work because the net your sketch doesn't
have a network connection unless you
have like a really great edgy sketch
like I really wonder if that would be a
successful product like smart edges
sketch anyway the point is that
crunchyroll is only 695 a month if you
enjoy it so head over to crunchyroll.com
