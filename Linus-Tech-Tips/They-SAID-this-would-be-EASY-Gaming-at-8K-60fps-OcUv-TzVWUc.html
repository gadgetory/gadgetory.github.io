8k consumer display and the conclusion
we came to was that given all the hoops
we had to jump through to get any more
than 30 Hertz working at 8k pretty much
wasn't worth the hassle and we were
gonna have to wait for this technology
to become practical but then sharp
electronics
watch to that video and basically said
hey it really shouldn't be that
difficult to get it working all you need
is the right TV so their commercial
display group sent over this charts
70-inch a KTV that actually utilizes not
one not two not three but four
concurrent HDMI connections to achieve
true 8k 60 Hertz functionality
supposedly with no hassle whatsoever
well I have a way of creating hassle
where no hassle existed before so I
truly wish them luck with that it's
making of wishing luck good luck to our
sponsor keeping your site up when all of
the ltte fans rushed to your site honey
is a free web browser extension that
will find you the best promo codes on
popular shopping websites like Amazon
eBay and more get it today at join
honeycomb slash LTT did I mention it's
free
step number one stand it's the easy part
step number D power cable still easy
it's dumb numbers right get a mean DC
powerful enough to run 8k step 4
introduce Andy who just cleared his
probation you don't have to duck from
the camera anymore dude alright do you
want to give me a hand with this oh so
ha let's go ahead and I'm gonna tip it
your way so we're gonna put the stand on
with it upside down okay do you want to
grab that screwdriver it's okay I got
this you can you can trust me he thinks
I might drop it gotta say the packing
for this is definitely more rudimentary
I think this is like a demo unit for
sending to potential commercial
customers or something
there's no I don't even think there was
a remote in the box it's a really clean
looking TV very little branding got your
Sharp logo over here ah quotes and then
you've just got eight k76 80 by 40 320
pixels baby okay here we go
now these HDMI cables are nothing
special but theoretically each one of
them is only carrying a 4k 60 signal
which should be fine just fine except
for one small problem no modern graphics
card contains more than usually one or
two HDMI connections now we tried a
solution a little while ago where we
used for graphics cards in a Quadro
mosaic display thing to drive quadrants
of a monitor it didn't work at all it
was super stupid performance sucked but
fortunately adapters to the rescue so
these are active
DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapters that I
acquired for that failed project and I
am hoping to finally see some success
with today so we're gonna get these bad
boys plugged in oh wait oh I had this
totally wrong before so when I pointed
at the HDMI ports before that was
completely wrong the HDMI ports I wanted
were down here so these are all just
individual normal HDMI ports this is a
single input input seven 8k signal input
and it's got like cable management clips
for and all that shiz so just like that
experiment with each separate graphics
card running a different quadrant of the
display this display does split input
seven into quadrants but unlike that one
we're using a single graphics card with
its single frame buffer in order to
drive all four quadrants or rather I
should say we're using two in SLI but
they're all hooked up to a single one so
we don't need any kind of external
synchronization card or anything like
that it thought should theoretically
just work believe it or not this is how
they usually run like future panel
technology demos at trade shows like CES
except instead of actually building them
into a real commercialized product they
just do it on like a crazy hand soldered
thing that sits under the curtain that
looks great I'm like feeling the what is
it what was it Mac sell or something
Memorex but you know that classic
commercial but now take KK me no signal
from external device hey bottom right
grab the signal holy it's on the whole
display now hold on a minute
no way there's no way it's gonna just
run a ke effortlessly okay one of them
is running at 50 Hertz why would that be
and how would that work that's bizarre
why would anyone want that one running
at 50 and the others running at 60 okay
let's have it
let's have a quick boo here so we need
to grab some games we're gonna get that
going but in the meantime know this did
not quite work perfectly out of the box
and I do think we have a little bit of
configuration to do so let's start by
figuring out which one of these is
broken
I suspect the one that's running at 50
Hertz but only one way to find out for
oh man that wasn't it oh boy oh boy okay
maybe just enter will do it no of course
not did it oh boy what is Oh he's dead
Jim
this isn't even working in the BIOS now
this is more broken than it was when we
started I have a way of creating hassle
where no hassle existed before okay so
it's running but still not correctly
however before we move forward I've got
a bit of an update for you guys as it
turns out at least one of the problems
we had was caused by invidious seemingly
arbitrary limitation on their consumer
graphics cards that only allows you to
set up an end the surround configuration
with a maximum of three displays so this
system is out and my test bench is in so
we've hooked this up with 2gb 100 Quadro
graphics cards these have 32 gigs of ram
over 5,000 cuda cores in terms of their
gaming performance they shouldn't be
that far off something like an RT X 2080
I mean they're not quite there but
they're certainly closer to that than
they are to attend a DTI then we ran
into another problem remember how I had
three of these DisplayPort to HDMI
adapter z' well these cards only have
DisplayPort outputs so I had to use
DisplayPort to DVI DVI to HDMI and then
that to the TV so while we are actually
running an Nvidia mosaic configuration
here and we can see that if we pull up
the Nvidia control panel and
theoretically when we go to manage GPU
utilization here we're running an SLI
but the SLI menu item went away once we
configured mosaic and it doesn't appear
that our second GPU is actually doing
anything for now this is what we're
stuck with though and damn it I want to
see 8k so we've got another one of these
DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and you guys
are coming with me for the ride of even
if the performance sucks finally getting
an 8k output here
all right once these are numbered oh I
see that's a new one I have literally
never seen it do that before
okay sure why not remember windows 95
guys remember you know who I really feel
bad for and all this is sharp they reach
out to go yeah you really shouldn't have
to jump through a bunch of stupid hoops
to get 8k 60 Hertz going on a PC and as
far as I can tell none of this is their
fault but this is an awful lot of stupid
hoops okay so I know set up multiple
displays is not the mosaic configuration
thing but the reason that I set all this
up correctly was that I was hoping that
now when we go to set up mosaic it'll
kind of grab that everything is the way
it's supposed to be and it'll work come
on
okay well it's letting me click Next and
that's correct okay let's try the other
graphics card I don't know I did notice
that even though we're plugged into the
one that would normally be in the
primary slot on the motherboard it's
identifying as GPU - so who knows maybe
this will help
there's more lunch frankly I'm pretty
close to the end of my rope I was doing
some off-screen troubleshooting
involving trying older Quadros so GP
100's instead of the GV 100's I did a
full platform swap and so motherboard
CPU change them out just meowed but I
don't know and it's always the same
thing I click apply it goes little bit
little bit yet and then there's no
finish but I do not accept that
conclusion and I have decided to try one
last thing we're gonna go AMD ok so
according to this community post it's
possible but I think I know why it might
not be where
okay I think it might just be grabbing
my configuration from Windows and then
assuming that I want a four by one okay
your display configuration has been
updated re-enable Eyefinity display
group know why the fact that it's rien a
below is what's tripping me out here I
don't want to re-enable it
I want to enable a new different one
that is not like what I had before I
don't know how to start fresh when I
disable it and it only prompts me to
re-enable it just AMD things easy
Nvidia things oh it's not working to be
clear neither of them is giving me a
working 60 Hertz a katehis way well
other than the boneheaded driver
limitation that doesn't allow me to
arrange it in a 2x2 this was a much
better experience but due to the
boneheaded driver implementation that
doesn't let me arrange it in a 2x2 I
guess we're going back to our next best
lead which is Quadro to see if maybe we
can get that to work it's been a few
more hours and a lifeline has arrived we
now have Oh No if they only shipped two
I'm gonna be so upset on two
no there's four okay the good news
though I also reached out to sharp and I
was like what tables did you guys use to
get this working because they assured me
it would be no problem piece of cake
piece of crumb cake and they said they
got these cables from PC cable world I
guess so these are DisplayPort to HDMI
cables rather than adapters
theoretically that is exactly the same
thing
at this point I don't know if I know
anything anymore if this doesn't work
I'm officially stumped here we go one
two Wow okay that did grab 4k 60 Hertz
on all four of them really fast you have
got to be kidding me
[Laughter]
so after all that I we could do four
times 4k but heaven forbid we want to
run them in mosaic on Nvidia with
adapters on AMD we could do four by one
at 4k but heaven forbid we want to
rearrange them like this wait what like
stop stop don't do it like whatever
you're changing now control panel stop
changing it because everything is
working this is right stop stop changing
things finish finish how could I just
could I just kill the task I wonder if I
can just kill the task Nvidia control
panel and task it worked 100% scaling
show me that native a K baby Wow
60 Hertz a K there it is launching a No
so what eight K max draw distance the
game wouldn't even launch but we've got
it at full medium 8k but there's bad
news too it drops to 30 frames per
second in the menu when it sits at 60 at
the main menu this does not bode well
for performance wow this is so like
disorienting sitting this close to the
city one of the issues with this game's
interface in general
and we're back so one of the problems
that I have with this game in general is
that you can't zoom the interface out
far enough and I especially feel it like
this cuz sitting this close to it
honestly is very comfortable in terms of
the detail of the game like even at the
maxim level let's go ahead and find one
of our wood cutters again here this guy
walking is cow that is unfreaking
believable I don't even have
anti-aliasing on I have zero
anti-aliasing on right now can you
believe that Renan will not look nuts
and that's crazy I love it so that was
it for a no now we're firing up shadow
of the Tomb Raider to see how a like a
third-person adventure game feels at 8k
so far pretty good I mean it's obviously
not running great we're looking at about
7 to 20 fps in menu and that's reported
by fraps that's clearly not even
accurate wow the hair and this is with
no anti-aliasing is incredible huh
actually in motion it's not nearly as
convincing part of that could be the 19
frame per second performance though you
know say what you will about Nvidia r-tx
and the performance impact and all that
but you've got our respect Nvidia for
recognizing that resolution is no longer
the biggest bottleneck in gaming image
quality and just trying something
anything else because sitting at a
reasonable distance like yeah that looks
crisp AF but is it really that much
better than 4k
that does look real sharp though pardon
the pun so there you go guys about 15
grand worth of graphics horsepower we're
looking at 20 FPS average pretty thick
let's see how many FPS we get in rocket
League hey Riley you want to play rocket
League for me help me Riley play at 8k
whoa it's an 8k yeah it's a keyboard
working hold on there you go there you
go whoa
like it's one thing being this close to
like a huge TV like this but it is like
actually sharp oh yeah is it a sharp TV
yeah like everything down to the treadle
like you can really tell that the the
video crowd is just balls
yeah it looks so sharp I have never seen
this game with this good so could you
get into playing on a big screen like
this size at this kind of resolution I
think I could get into it yeah probably
so I guess that's pretty much the
conclusion of this video is it K cool
yeah really freakin cool it's glitchy
right now and we don't have the
performance that we need for it to run
its best but when it works man is that
incredible now I don't think that
sitting this close to a TV in order to
appreciate the extra sharpness that 8k
provides is necessarily practical but
that doesn't mean that in applications
like VR where the display is much closer
to your eyes and you really need that
resolution so you don't get a screen
door effect that it won't be an
incredible difference maker moving
forward we just need much more powerful
graphics cards and obviously some work
on the software side but with the whole
you know not wanting to crash all the
time and all that speaking of not
wanting to crash all the time I'd hate
for you guys to get bored and crash out
of this video before I tell you about
our sponsor the mass drop HD 6xx
headphones are one of mass drops
all-time bestsellers with over 60,000
units sold and no wonder because they've
got an unchanged driver structure from
the HD 650s which are an absolute legend
they've got a detachable six-foot cable
instead of a 10-foot cable unlike the HD
650 s but the sound signature is
unchanged so you've got nice balance
mids natural sounding bass and they're
open back for a nice natural soundstage
they come with Sennheiser's long-term
support and you can buy them at the link
below at drop com
so thanks for watching guys if you
disliked this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description I
actually think this is one of their
commercial products I have no idea if
you can buy it also in the video
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you guys should
