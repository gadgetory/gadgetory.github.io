one we are finally upgrading our editing
workstations and by finally I mean
didn't we just upgrade all these and put
them on like a whole room water cooling
loop well that didn't work out very well
the whole room loop ended up dirty and
disgusting so we are going back to good
old-fashioned air cooling and we're
upgrading our antiquated Titan blacks to
Titan exes for a reason that might not
make well hmm the Titan blacks were
doing okay we just we needed more
DisplayPort outputs for our fancy new 4k
monitors but there is a catch today to
each of the editors will be responsible
for their own PC upgrade so expect some
high jinks in today's video
the mastercase 5 by Cooler Master lets
you make your mid tower PC case your own
with an assortment of modular
accessories check out the link in the
video description to learn more so um
this is kind of tricky
we need your editing workstations I I
need my editing works right but I need
your editing workstation what poor so
that we can upgrade it yeah okay well he
needs to work and I also need that one
berkel okay I need to export this though
ah permits pertinent that I yeah in last
night it didn't work didn't work failed
is it working now ah also its Olson's
but it doesn't export what happens to
the export it don't work so here's the
current state of the editing again you
can see each of the editors at least one
of them brandon has managed to make it
in here with his existing workstation
they've got their new dual 31 evany 97
4k monitors from LG they've got their
new silencio mid towers
edie know how to build a computer yes I
do actually I probably the only editor
here he knows Brendan do you know how to
build a computer yes I've had to watch
Linus build one for two years every time
we didn't feel good so I think I do I'm
not sure
it's it's going okay hopefully it works
so IPL Briscoe make new computers Dennis
do you know how to build a computer no I
don't know I already know how to edit
yes you don't use a drill I'll take up
on a computer not necessary and
potentially dangerous size does not
matter it's how you use it so first up
we've got gem into s52 for version 2 CPU
cooler silencio 652 s cases X 540
network card this is going to be the
centerpiece of the new machines CPU is
the 4960 X's are 32 gigs of kingston
valueram and our x79 deluxe motherboards
as well as be 750 power supplies will
stay the same but all the water cooling
has got to go so we're going to wear
anti-static wrist straps um usually at -
Media Group we would do that but I don't
have enough for all of you so you'll
have to just ground yourself on the
power supply periodically we got to
dream these puppies ah that's raining
you guys should be safe to work anywhere
behind it just live pull out the CPU
block and the GPUs and then just kind of
let them hang there ok the next step
remove your old graphics card so this
screw right here yeah there you go ok so
now we're actually going to tip it up
for the draining process
that is some dirty water that is why
Holdren didn't word corrosion you want
to put this into the top nozzle here and
switch it on to blow up the loop now
Edie you are ready for this step as well
but yours is a little trickier because
you got oh that's a good noise yeah I
have my graphics card out my rad amount
I'm having a hard time getting my
motherboard out but I'm not sure why
sometimes it just gets caught on the i/o
shield oh yeah I think that's what it is
yeah berkel do you know how to build a
computer no I do not and I've never
built well I have one but I didn't
really like build it I think I bought it
built I think you pulled it off get it
yes are you ready turn no I'm rendering
the super fun video we need your
workstation yes I know but I'm I need to
render and that needs to happen now
because it will not happen later because
problems happen there's been many bugs -
give me all that this is no longer your
problem
and this Tarantino mobile computer
vaguely I put my brother's computer
together but he actually messaged me it
said Taran you never got this working
the GPU was not installed it's not
attached okay so the next fad is this
your new case yeah you're getting so far
ahead ok yeah are sick that there's a
lot you have to I mean the cripples take
apart your old computer
oh that's trash let's do the noon we're
gonna take each component to
blow-by-blow modesta over there look at
that sweet custom is to get a portable
hard drive I put in here yeah it's
pretty games why would you limit it to
that berkel birth all tech tips
that's generous
I hate those type of connectors memory
up first then you can reach it
have you ever taken apart a computer no
this is my first time so Dennis what do
you do when your computer gets broken in
Taiwan you just pay and someone fix it
so I had no idea about this come around
the other side check what was that oh no
what is that
Taran's system must have been leaking
somewhere or dripping somewhere at some
point there is a lack of corrosion on
the SI OS so it's not until I fully take
this apart that I'm gonna know the
extent of the damage go ahead removing
those screws yeah it was working fine
notice how I must string them in the
crosswise Kevin good job yeah I learned
that for a certain lightness of light as
tip tips all right like heck no okay
okay Brandon's gonna be the first one
doing his CPU cooler default never
unscored this cooler you got this right
Brandon no problem easy peasy for hell
ah another group first I don't know if I
got all the screws whoa okay well yeah I
don't know how harden supposed to pull
up blow of Breaking and then pull the
rest of the wires and you're ready LaVon
Merkel was next I really do feel like
the teacher they're like a class right
now and that bring them outside and
we'll warm up Nick managed to convinced
us that these were internet - I knew it
useless is it the red yeah
that's using uh-oh orientation yeah have
you really given that much thought I
figured this just give me the
differences let's do it
ah take everything out yeah that all
looks good - go ahead and put that next
to the one that has the graphics parts
on it I mean this way okay but can you
guys get your old stuff out of here this
is why I specifically you know - this is
just install the rim before the cooler
just is easy
what I can just keep these screws right
I mean a screw is a screw this is why
links me I've been on time to the class
yeah I was fixing a video that we have
to put up plug in your headers for you
screwing on work what's a header these
things look like headers from a hot dog
piece of my case fell off that I have no
idea what it's for what what is this
where's my second title is not getting a
second Titan this time oh my god you're
like a child
hey you dad I never claimed to be your
dad I'll be super weird then then why
did you make me sit on your lap all
those nuns because I'm Santa
oh there's no there's no I own shield
installed in here oh that's gonna cost
him gig what's my pcs don't have high
heels I gotta I gotta I oh sure oh good
all right that's one step ahead again so
now you need to put these little brass
things maybe c d e f g jael oh well this
is going to go on our slash tech support
more right here do you do merkel screwed
and his mother board without a standoff
I sure hope it still works it's right
against the back of the case okay
oh man I sure hope this boards okay what
cuz it was bent a bit a hole more than a
bit though I bet it's still been oh no
it managed to snap back yeah yeah this
is bent like right down to the
motherboard well don't bend it again
it's very rare where you're freaking out
and I'm not I only freaked out when it's
really really bad haha half of the
screws you used for the wrong ones
oh come on I showed you this yeah and
half of the ones you used are this you
can't even tell the difference they're
not the same at all still smooth yes
screwed up the length is wrong they
working with a whole motherboard on oh
you pull this off and put it in your
case box sure it stays and this fan
again down here Terron you put in two of
the wrong screws again all look the same
oh well that one's slightly different
yeah and oh right these need to plug in
to the motherboard they saw earlier
having sex
oh my god all right look why why not
check yeah so you should have another
USB header okay
did you ever screw these all the way in
oh we're not all the way oh good thing I
checked it is the one who was
legitimately done first I'm gonna look
Pete yep I like that tool that you were
complaining about don't put really are
you okay turns out that you needed to
use it useless
is it the red yeah that's using no well
I don't know we're talking about it
so Brenda needs to actually tighten his
CPU heatsink chili okay though because I
can just take this by hand anyway I need
to put hard drive my SSD is my friend
man Allah did I mess it up what are you
doing I'm just gonna leave your NIC not
very cool very cool you just don't know
it yet that's ten gigabit it's super
fast just like you yeah but I got like
ten JPEG yeah - how many JPEGs is this
computer - well let's do email and I am
easier reading at the iTunes run there
does this get the net hey Linus where do
you connect the phone into to run the
Internet is this really it that's all
the house oh that's right so what is
that about how easy this is and how you
should make your own youtube channel
this is super easy you know to make my
own YouTube channel no sspeak hour yeah
I don't have any power but power I aha
so all that's left is to find out if the
computers work so we're going to use
Brandon's workstation there
they quick what are you doing dude those
are custom I mean technically it doesn't
hurt anything it's just inconvenient so
all this left now is to make sure they
all work and then stay tuned when we do
the actual tour of not just the new
editing rigs but also all the
peripherals and like cool stuff that we
have to go with them
okay mr. Dunn first couple things here
your Quadro is not screwed in at all
your tight bags is missing a screw
also this 8-pin connector isn't plugged
in all the way so that is why we weren't
getting a post Brandan's and EDS
machines both working we are making real
progress here folks but the real test is
for the verticals computer so I'm saving
that for last okay so here's the last
one let's find out if Merkel's computer
works why wouldn't it is perfect
boy host thank goodness I don't know
it's probably fine cuz if you snapped
your motherboard in half it should
pretty much be dead
