overclocking acoustics temperature
especially comparing the cyclone GeForce
GT s 450 from MSI against the PNY
reference GeForce GTS 250 now as I
mentioned in the respecting unblock
respecting respective unboxings for both
of these cards they do take a slightly
different approach so you can see here
the cyclone does not really exhaust much
air outside of the case so it's gonna be
at a bit of an advantage today because
we are testing on an open test platform
here whereas the PNY car does exhaust
probably a good 30 to 40 percent of the
air outside of the case with this shroud
and cooler maybe even more may be more
like 40 to 50 percent but it does have
the disadvantage of not having this a
wide open spread out designed to dis
dissipate the heat quite as well so
first of all let's have a look we're
running combustor with four times
anti-aliasing to really just beat the
heck out of these cards they are running
at stock speed right now but you can see
that the cyclone cooler keeps that GTS
450 at a cool 48 degrees even under 100%
GPU usage the fan speed is up around 53%
so if we wanted to we could really crank
it up and we could probably squeeze
better cooling out of this unit so here
why don't we just do that for a minute
see what happens well it's fine let me
yeah there it goes actually I guess
that's not really the point of what I'm
doing today so let's put it back to auto
where it will wrap itself down ever so
slowly and I want you to have a list of
that sort of how loud that fat is to
hear it ramping down still ramping down
some more or not quite all the way to
where it will finally settle we're still
up around 67%
so it's quite quiet down below anywhere
below about 60% and it makes this way
all the way down to 51% so that's the
noise under load for the cyclone cooler
alright well here's our idle noise
testing and you can probably hear what
you think is the cyclone fan quite
clearly right now but if I go ahead and
stop this corsair fan behind it
hopefully you'll be able to hear that it
actually gets quite a bit quieter the
cyclone fan is nearly silent at idle now
you can see it runs at about 40% at
about 31 degrees and that's kind of
useless unless I give you some context
for the temperature of the room so it's
about twenty six point five degrees
Celsius that'd be intake for the fed now
let's switch over to the PNY reference
card with combustor running you can see
we've got the GPU temperatures are quite
a bit higher but there's a very good
reason for that it doesn't all come down
to cooler design so it is running at 64
to 65 degrees on the GPU but check this
out the fan RPMs stay down around 30% so
what that means is this card is exactly
as quiet under load which is basically
completely inaudible over the noise of
my desktop PC behind me back there
and really that's not even a loud
desktop either so that's kind of an
interesting way they've that P&amp;amp;Y has
tweaked the fan profiles because you can
ste see even under 100% load which
you'll never encounter in a game it
doesn't get up into any kind of a danger
zone in terms of GPU temperatures so
it's um yeah it's not an apples to
apples comparison that we were able to
do today but here maybe this will help
why don't we take the fans beat and
throw it up around 50% there we go so
fan speed is up around 51% so let's say
you wanted to keep the GPU a little bit
cooler let me give that some time to
stabilize the temperatures and then I'll
go ahead and do a quick noise test on
that one too and we can compare those
temperatures
oh yeah room temps okay so if you wanted
to take manual control over your fan
here's more of an apples-to-apples
comparison we've got 52 degrees on the
GPU we're running it at 51 percent now
I'd say at 51 percent this fan sounds a
little bit louder than the cyclone fan
but remember to that as soon as you go
and put the cyclone in a case you're
going to be exhausting heat into your
case which is going to be recycled into
the fan and this one's gonna blow a
little bit more out the back of the case
via these vents than the cyclone will so
that couple of degrees might be made up
for it is like I said a touch louder but
that's neither here nor there at this
point I think we want to do some
overclocking results on both of these
cards over the next little bit so
continue to stay tuned don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips actually one
more short clip just wanted to show you
what this fan sounds like at full speed
it only lets me go up to 70 for whatever
reason I'm not quite sure why 70 percent
but
that's what this one sounds like Apple
speed compared to this idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
