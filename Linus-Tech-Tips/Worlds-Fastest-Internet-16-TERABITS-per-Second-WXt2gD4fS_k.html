to yon shopping Sweden why would we do
that you might ask to take a look at the
world's fastest internet connection a
whopping 1.6 terabits per second at
Dreamhack 2018 to put that kind of speed
into context that is fast enough that
everyone in st. John's Newfoundland
could stream high-definition video at
the same time and to download pub G at
that full speed would take only 1/16 of
a second they set this up in part to
make sure that the over 6000 people
connected to their network have a great
gaming experience but also because of
course londo bragging rights so let's
have a look at the gear and setup
involved and give a big shout-out to
calm hem for sponsoring this video
so how do you get 1.6 terabits per
second you might think that you need a
massive honking cable like the size of
my face with all of the internet getting
crammed through it but in reality it's
way smaller and way smarter this tiny
yellow cable right here is responsible
for the whole shebang it's just a
regular everyday fiber cable but within
it there are eight different wavelengths
of light each capable of 200 gigabit per
second when the cable enters the
transmission system here it is split off
using a combination of passive ie
mirrors and lenses and active signal
manipulation to split the different
wavelengths apart into more conventional
signals these signals are carried
through this larger wire which contains
sixteen fibers and then they're split
apart into individual fibers here from
there the signal undergoes another
splitting and is turned into 100 Gig
purple fibers that then leave the
transmission system supplied by the ISP
calm hem and go over to dream hacks
routers in here the signal is mirrored
to allow monitoring and then it gets
sent off to one of the 23 distribution
switches around the floor now
up until now the signal has been
completely fiber but it has to be turned
into a regular old copper connection for
the final 20 feet or so so that happens
here one gigabit is sent to each of the
260 access switches where individual
gamers will plug in their computers and
receive 100 megabit Internet that is
unless their baller and shelled up for
the premium package in that case their
switch will get a 10 gig uplink and they
will get provisioned a full one gigabit
connection just for them finally those
huge pop G updates can be downloaded
quickly so this is all well and good so
far
fast internet who wouldn't want that but
where it really gets crazy is in the
department of redundancy department
each distribution switch has two
physical connections to the routers so
someone could actually trip over one of
the cables without anyone losing their
internet connection at most they drop a
packet or two and if the Dreamhack
router that is going to all the switches
fails gg no see the two routers on the
ends here they are completely identical
blo either one of them up and the game
shall continue and it doesn't even stop
there that 1.6 terabit wire it first
travels to a data center in yon shopping
where it gets split into two 800 gig
fibers that separately travel to
Stockholm so if you cut one of those
wires you've got well 1.6 terabit
because those data centers are also
connected together so you would have to
literally blow one of them up to drop
this to a piddly 800 gigabit but of
course all of those things could go
wrong or someone could just cut the main
cable here do it do it I dare you and
even if that happened just 45
milliseconds later the routers will have
failed over to the 410 gig fibre cables
which also take two different routes to
the main data center in Stockholm making
it basically impossible to fully take
the internet away from this land party
alright so now we've got Internet into
all the switches but every single one of
the routers and switches needs to be
configured and at this scale manually
configurating each switch would take an
eternity and even things you wouldn't
normally think about like running out of
IP addresses become big issues so to
address this I'm sorry all of the
switches are dynamically configured via
an automated deployment system based on
DHCP TFTP and Python so that is
basically plug-and-play they're also
using a monitoring software called
prometheus so if a switch goes down they
just know that one has stopped working
they also know its physical location in
the building and they're using a
front-end called Griffin ax that creates
graphs for tracking things like total
hours played in each game
what domains are used the most and the
total network usage at any moment so we
figured out how they solved the problem
of getting Internet to the six thousand
or so participants but every computer
monitor and RGB strip has to be powered
as well and all of those combined dry
massive one megawatt or 1 million watts
of power and the fancy stages that
showcase the best gamers and musical
performances will they gobble up another
megawatt so some pretty serious gear has
to be deployed to make sure that someone
with a 79 80 XC or a thread ripper
doesn't hit Cinebench and make the whole
place go dark so 3 10 kilovolt lines
come in and get transformed down to 400
volts and about 1500 amps then they
enter this room right here or one of the
other nine just like it from here it is
split up into four hundred volt 400 amp
lines that run to the various sub
central distribution centers or 400 volt
rails along the ceiling where it gets
fed into a box that can handle 63 amps
these power distribution boxes were
actually custom-made for dreamhack and
the older ones can handle two rows of
landers while the new ones largely due
to computers and especially monitors
getting more energy efficient since the
event started can handle three rows
these are also secured with our CD so
that if leaking current is detected
let's say someone puts their finger in a
socket or spills coke on a power bar the
power is immediately cut to the group so
no one gets hurt and a maximum of only 8
computers will go down but what happens
if you aren't fortunate enough to make
it to Sweden for the land but you still
want to watch the eSports that are all
going on at the same time that's where
dream hacks very smart and also kind of
jank completely custom broadcasting
server comes into play so instead of
running a traditional broadcasting
server and mixer
combination all of the video and audio
streams go into a video hub a video
mixer and several rendering servers that
are behind me right now and then
everything can be switched and
configured over the network this allows
for some really cool things like being
able to switch inputs from basically
anywhere so that they can be manipulated
from the dedicated mixers here or by
raspberry PI's placed wherever they're
needed there's also an in-game observing
team that has access to a delayed feed
allowing them to show important moments
from several angles instant replay style
since they've built a custom solution
using Casper CG they're able to do other
cool integrations using data from the
game engine as well so they can create
graphics that show things like player
health what weapon they're using or the
timer on the bomb
these additionally are hooked up to the
stage setting so the lights screens and
even the pyrotechnics like for when the
bomb goes off are all automatically
synced so it's been really cool to see
all of the custom work that goes into
making a massive event like this tick
from the fastest internet connection in
the world to smaller things like the
ability to easily mute a host and I hope
you guys have enjoyed it so huge thanks
to you for watching and a massive shadow
