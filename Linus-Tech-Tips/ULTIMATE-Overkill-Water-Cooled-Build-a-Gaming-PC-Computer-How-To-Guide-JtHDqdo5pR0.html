we have ever done this system with all
the peripherals that we're going to
suggest might be appropriate for it is
going to cost over six thousand dollars
u.s. so it is not for the faint of heart
however if you want nothing but the best
of the best
I can stand pretty confidently behind
any of the recommendations on this table
so who is this system for exactly well
number one is the components we've
chosen are optimized for gaming number
two is they are optimized for
overclocking and number three is they
are optimized for a very very quiet
operation and we've also gone with a
full custom liquid cooling setup in
order to help us achieve the goals of
gaming overclocking and quiet operation
all at the same time now with that said
our choices here today were not dictated
by performance per dollar or any kind of
value metric really we're going for the
best possible performance that we can
get and that's it for our CPU and
motherboard combo we've gone with a
4770k unlocked processor from Intel so
this is on the LGA 1150 platform and
we've gone with a Maximus 6 extreme
motherboard from a seuss now you might
ask why didn't we go LGA 2011 with this
system the benefits of LGA 2011 are more
cores more ram as well as more PCI
Express Lanes natively but because this
is a gaming oriented system and not a
workstation we aren't going to benefit
from those things as much as will
benefit from being able to use a
fourth-generation Haswell architecture
because most games are lightly threaded
workloads compared to a
second-generation Sandy Bridge
architecture which at the time of
filming this is the highest available on
the LGA 2011 platform next up is
graphics cards we've gone with to Asus
GeForce GTX Titans with coolants water
blocks on them
the reason we're water-cooling them is
that you can get higher boost clocks if
you keep these GPUs very cool due to GP
Boost 2.0 and the reason we've gone with
Titans as opposed to GTX 690 s or Radeon
7990 s
is that I personally find that the best
scaling and the best compatibility comes
with two-way graphics card
configurations of no more than two cards
now the reason to use two titans as
opposed to a single 690 is that you get
a six gig frame buffer with GTX Titan
that is not available on any other
consumer grade gaming graphics card that
means particularly when running at high
resolutions Titan is going to deliver a
better gaming experience with large
textures so now and in the future than
any other solution on the market storage
is very personal but we've gone with two
Intel 520 series 240 gig SSDs for a
total of almost 500 gigabytes of OS fast
raid 0 so accelerated SSD goodness for
our applications then we've gone with 2
Western Digital red series 3 terabyte
drives in raid 1 for redundancy
now we could add more of those drives in
a more elaborate raid configuration but
the most important point I want to make
here guys is for our OS and applications
and the things that we can always
reinstall if we lose them we're using
raid 0 which is fast but not safe and
then to back up that SSD array on a
nightly basis at least as well as to
archive important data we're using a
safe raid 1 array on a raid optimized
drive such as the WD red also in line
with our gaming theme is the use of an
asus Xonar Phoebus sound card it's very
similar to the zone ours ents that I've
been using for quite a while now except
it's a little bit more gaming optimized
so it has a front control pod you can
plug your headphone microphone into it
uses all three-and-a-half millimeter
connectors and it always gets the latest
software updates from Asus for their
gaming optimized features so my
understanding is that their new radar
will be coming to it soon which is a
visual indicator of where sounds are
coming from just kind of neat we're
using primo chill primo flex LRT
advanced tubing my personal favorite
type of tubing it's awesome we're using
coolants 3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD
compression fittings what I like about
these is the fact that they can be
wrenched tight or hand tight
and they look outstanding we are also
using a phobia gold-plated reservoir
which looks pretty
bling-bling as well as a coolants three
adi cpu block which is one of the best
performing cpu blocks on the market the
last couple water cooling components are
a swift tec m CP 6 5 v pump it's really
the only one I recommend and a phobia
gold-plated reservoir for peripherals
these are so personalized but these are
some pretty good general recommendations
we've gone with a Logitech g7 10 plus it
uses Cherry MX brown switches Logitech's
excellent software and even includes
along with the media keys and
programmable G keys an o-ring mod on
every single switch making them even a
little bit softer to type on we've also
got a death outer 2013 although a
Logitech G 700 s would be another great
pairing for that particular keyboard the
thing people like about the Death Adder
2013 is it's one of the highest
sensitivity optical mice on the market
as opposed to laser mice so there's none
of those weird acceleration issues
finally for our headphones we've gone
with the custom one pro from Bayer
dynamic and we recommend checking out
the mod Mike if you need something to go
along with it
or perhaps something like a blue
snowball which is an excellent desktop
microphone and last but not least the
elephant in the room right here the 900
d pretty much the only case maybe not
the only but one of the only cases in
existence capable of housing this type
of a machine especially all those
radiators the first step in any
successful build endeavor is ensuring
that you're at a static safe workstation
so I don't recommend working on carpet
and in our case we're working on a mod
mat Xtreme I recommend using an
anti-static wrist or ankle strap I
prefer to keep it on my ankle so it's
out of my way and last but not least
you'll need a multi-bit screwdriver just
a Philips head will work for most basic
builds but with this one things got a
little bit crazy we ended up needing a
power drill and some other things as
well but you can do most of what you're
about to see with just the stuff I've
outlined already this step is really
really important guys pay close
attention particularly with a
liquid-cooled build it is extremely
important to build the system outside of
the box outside of the case
just like we've done in the past on our
build guide so you can check that out
there because the last thing you want is
to spend hours and hours putting it
together only to have it not boot up
because something was dead on arrival
particularly for graphics cards now we
liquid-cooled these graphics cards in a
separate video so you can check that out
but you don't want to install a water
block on it only to find out that it is
defective so install it with an air
cooler run the whole system do your burn
in tests then it is time to actually
assemble the computer for the sake of
keeping this video a little bit shorter
we're not going to do a step-by-step on
it this time around though guys so just
check out one of our previous build
guides for how to build it outside of
the case I recommend using your
motherboard box as an anti-static
workstation for this step once you've
done your safety build outside of the
case and grab all the components that
you need out of the motherboard box so
that you're not in and out of there all
the time so all the SATA cables you need
to install all of your drives the i/o
shield which you'll need for the back of
your case as well as the wireless module
that also acts as an NG F F upgrade slot
and the antenna that goes with it this
is a cool antenna it actually attaches
magnetically to your case or anything
else that's nearby this piece is
optional this is a sousou's OC panel it
comes with the Maximus 6 extreme it
allows you to access some tweaking
options whether you mount it outside of
the case or orient it this way and mount
it in a five and a quarter inch base so
that it can sit and operate in a more
basic mode from inside the case there's
also a custom cable that goes with that
speaking of custom cables the last thing
we'll need is an SLI bridge because we
are going to be running two graphics
cards now it's time to install the CPU
note carefully the orientation of the
Golden Triangle on the corner of the CPU
as well as the little plastic triangle
on the socket cover you're going to want
to line those up when you're installing
it next pull up the retention arm you
don't need to remove the plastic cover
yet position the CPU inside the socket
carefully give it a little wiggle to
make sure it's in the correct spot then
all you have to do is let the arm come
down slowly sliding the retention clip
under the nut
then push down pull out and lock it
under the retention arm the little
plastic cover will pop off and then your
CPU is installed water cooling is all a
little different so follow the
instructions that's really really
important this particular block comes
with a large silicone isolating pad as
well as a hefty metal backplate if it's
not oriented correctly on the back of
the board you could have problems later
on so make sure that the cutout notch
has the shape of the CPU backplate sort
of corresponding to it so just be
careful is all I'm really saying thermal
compound application now I prefer icy
Diamond over other thermal compounds but
just for lulz I pulled out an ancient
tube of OC Z ultra v plus just to show
you the method just apply about the size
of an uncooked grain of rice in a line
down the middle of the CPU and you're
golden
now that back plates on there but it's
not secure at all in order to get it
firmed up take four plastic washers and
put them over each of the four posts
followed by the four thumb nuts now
these ones should go down enough that
they're quite tight because these are
what's going to keep the posts in place
now that it's secured you can put the
CPU block down on top of the CPU
followed by four more plastic washers
four springs and finally the four large
thumb nuts now these ones you're going
to want to tighten in a cross pattern
and don't wrench them tight don't go so
tight that the board is flexing and the
CPU block is flexing it just has to be
tight enough that it makes good contact
with the processor underneath finally
put two of the compression fittings on
to the CPU block no need to put the top
pieces on yet because we haven't
installed tubing yet and that's pretty
much it for your CPU block rhyme
installation not too complicated guys
now do note that this particular board
the Maximus six formula has tabs on only
one side so I recommend putting the non
tab side in first followed by pressing
firmly on the tab side until it locks
into place we have four dims so we're
going to do this four times
with the tool list release in the back
we can take off the windowed side panel
of the 900 D as always I recommend
stashing your side panels somewhere safe
preferably inside the box that your case
came in with the foam in between so that
they don't get damaged in any way next
up you can open up the basement by
pressing the little tab here and pulling
it open that's where you'll find the box
with all the hardware that you need to
install pretty much anything you could
possibly want to in the Corsair 900 D
now the first thing we're actually going
to install is our i/o plate which as
with any case is installed simply by
aligning it with the hole at the back of
the chassis and then popping each of the
four corners in individually the M PCIe
combo 2 card acts as both a wireless
module this is wireless AC as well as an
NG FF expansion slot so you can simply
plug it in in the top of the board here
screw it in from the back then you're
ready to mount the board once that's
done you'll see that the motherboard
standoffs for our standard ATX sized
board are already applied so all we need
to do is take the appropriate screws out
of the box of screws and put nine screws
through the board into the back of the
motherboard tray you know how your room
kind of gets Messier before it gets
cleaner this is the part where we
actually have to disassemble things
before we can continue assembling them
so we're going to take out the rear fan
we're going to take off the front
aluminum plate and take off the front
fans by undoing the screws we are going
to remove all three of the existing
triple drive cages that are in the 900 D
by removing the screws at the back and
finally we're even going to remove the
screws that are holding in the
additional mount point for another one
of those drive cages remember you can
get them optionally now we have a
clearer idea of what we're dealing with
now this my friends is when things start
getting really serious business so just
for the sake of knowing where it is so
we don't accidentally install any
radiators that
interfere with it we're going to put the
power supply in now so I recommend
putting the power supply in on the side
of the case that is nearest to the
motherboard tray the reason for that is
it's shorter runs to the components
particularly up the back of the tray
however this case does support dual
power supplies and you can put it in
whichever Bay you prefer now mounting
radiators most of the radiator mounts in
this case are Native however there are
two pieces of metal that were hidden
that we actually took the screws that
hold them in place out when we were
removing the cage mounts on the bottom
of the case one of them is cleverly
labeled down and the other is cleverly
labeled up these simply mount to the
case using little hooks as then and then
screws to hold them in place permanently
once they're in these are what are going
to allow us to mount that quad radiator
that goes on this side now we're ready
to start physically planning the layout
of our loop in terms of where we want to
install fittings radiators and tubing
this is the point in the build where you
want to actually make sure all of your
carefully laid plans are even going to
work take those radiators do quick test
fits make sure that you not only have
room for the radiators and graphics
cards and other bulky components but
also that you have room for the
associated cables and fittings and
tubing that's going to go with them
because even the best laid plans well it
is possible to make mistakes once you've
done your test fit it's a great idea to
take some of the little difficult
hard-to-reach connectors and plug them
in now before you put in your graphics
card and you have a bunch of tubing
running all over the place and all that
stuff so we've done some rudimentary
cable management with them here on the
back panel then we're going to plug in
basically just the easy stuff front USB
three front USB two front panel audio as
well as our front connectors for our
power switch reset switch and indicator
LEDs next up remove the five PCI slot
covers that correspond to where you want
to install your cards guys there's no
shame in consulting the manual at this
point to find out which slots are most
optimal for the kinds of cards you're
installing for that matter
even for that last part where you're
installing the front panel connectors
guys it's all in the manual usually in a
little leaflet QuickStart guide but you
can consult
so once we've pulled those off we're
going to install the sound card first
just because that one's not in the way
of anything else for doing then this is
where things start to get a little bit
tricky because with our two graphics
cards we're going to be using a special
sli fitting that allows us to put them
very close together which you normally
wouldn't be able to do with fittings and
tubing in between so once we've done
that we're going to rearrange all the
other fittings according to the test fit
we did before and where we want pipes
coming in and out of what is now a
single graphics card assembly we're
going to take that whole thing install
it into the two slots then put the thumb
screws back in and our expansion cards
are now done the next thing I like to do
is install the radiators where they're
going to go according to our overall
design for flow so the first thing
you'll have to do is remove the top
cover on the nine hundred d there's a
little tab in here you basically put
your thumb in there and then push
forward towards the front of the case
and that comes off revealing the
radiator mount there we go up there on
the top then you're going to have to
take each of the radiators and plug all
the extra holes that you do not need
okay we're going for slightly positive
air pressure here guys so basically on
the bottom in the basement we're going
to have air moving through towards the
power supplies intake and then out the
other side then up in the top we're
going to have three intake fans that are
not on a radiator behind the drive cages
pulling air in we're going to have our
rear fan here pulling air in and then
we're going to have four fans up here on
the top pushing air out so this should
give us slightly more intake then we
have exhaust allowing for slightly
positive pressure which usually results
in less dust buildup radiator mounting
can be a bit of a bear and a big part of
the problem is that these guys can't all
standardize on something they've all got
a different way they expect you to
attach the fans to the rad so alpha cool
includes two different lengths of screws
with bare rads we're
going to be using the shorter of the two
now be careful when you're mounting fans
directly to the radiator that you orient
the labels correctly if that matters to
you as well as the direction that the
wire leads are coming off for optimal
cable management it's going to be
difficult to undo this later and redo it
after the fact for our bottom quadruple
120 millimeter radiator what we did was
we mounted all the fans directly to the
red and then because alpha cool again
that whole standards can't be
consolidated thing did not include short
screws the good news is they use the
same threads as an optical drive so we
were able to use some of the screws
included with our 900 d-- to mount this
rad down here in the bottom for our rear
120 millimeter again we weren't able to
use the included screws so what we ended
up using was more of the cased screws
however we had to use a washer here
because the holes at the back of the
case were so wide that the narrow heads
that were included with both the rad
screws and the included case screws went
right through them because they're
intended for fan screws then we used one
of the shorter length screws to mount
the fan directly to the rad for our top
mounted radiator again we're going for a
pull configuration here we used the
longer screws because now we're going
all the way through a fan all the way
through the case and into the radiator
in order to get them mounted now this is
again a spot where you're going to want
to do any test fits that you think you
need to do for example here in the back
we were not able to orient the 120 mil
rad in what I would consider to be the
optimal orientation with the barbs up
this makes it easier to bleed the air
out of it instead we had to turn it
around and it was still a very tight fit
with our tubing to ensure that we were
actually going to be able to get water
up to that top radiator removing the top
panel on the 900 D is pretty simple once
you get the hang of it
just flip the tab under here slide it
off to the left-hand side of the case if
you're facing it from the front and
that's how you get access to mounting
that top rad and this goes to show you
guys that no matter what you do there's
bound to be a minor oopsy
we had to take our power supply out and
the reason for this is with it in we
realized we couldn't access the
on the quad radiator in the basement
because it was too close so we weren't
going to be able to install tubing on it
what we'll have to do instead is install
our dual radiator using the long screws
washers and then going through a fan
into the rad this gives us a very
natural airflow path in the bottom of
the case here so you can see we're
pulling air through this way and then
pulling it out this way so it's all
going in the same direction not fighting
itself and then once we've done that we
can run all the tubing run all the
fittings in the basement including
getting tubing installed on the pump
which is going to go next to the dual
rad right down here then we can put our
power supply back in and start getting
the cables hooked up part of getting the
basement of the case plumbed correctly
is installing the reservoir which
actually is going to go up here by the
PCI slots now guys got a pen ready write
this down
the order of your loop does not matter
you know CPU block GPU block radiator
resident it doesn't matter we're talking
maybe a degree or two of difference but
what does matter is having the pump
pulling water directly from your
reservoir that way it can never run dry
now we used the flexible fitting options
on this particular fobia gold-plated res
in order to make sure that we were going
to have clearance to install our tubing
so it has an inlet on the top which I
would actually recommend using as a fill
port otherwise you're going to get
trickling noise and then it has two
different fittings that come out at
about sort of 70 degrees on the sides
and two on the bottoms it's important to
use one on either side because there's a
baffle in the middle of the reservoir
that keeps the cyclone effect from
occurring sucking air into your pump
making it louder and less efficient
fobia ships a pretty robust mounting
system with this particular res now we
could drill holes in fact later on in
this build we are going to drill holes
and stuff but for this one it wasn't
really necessary we were able to use
some of the vent holes at the back of
the case in order to get our two c clips
installed then all we had to do was put
the plastic washer on then put on the
metal nut tighten it with a screwdriver
and we were ready to snap our reservoir
into place now the one challenge here is
that once you've already got all
of your expansion cards installed you're
going to have to remove your reservoir
to change them but you probably won't be
changing them that often so you might
want to try and find a different place
to put the res this was the place that
we found that made sense when you're
actually installing tubing some people
believe in sort of putting it in the
spot and like measuring it and then
cutting to measure I don't what I
usually do is I install one end of it so
remember guys you've already got the
fitting component of your compression
fitting screwed into whatever component
it happens to be whether it's a block or
radiator so make sure before you put the
tubing on it you actually put the
retention ring on top of the tubing
otherwise you're going to have to run it
all the way in from the other end now go
ahead and install it on there tighten it
down finger tight pretty much as far as
you can go remember that's holding it on
and compressing it for a good seal then
line it up run it to where it needs to
go and just mark it with your finger
then pull it out and cut it with either
a tubing cutter or a very sharp pair of
scissors if you have dull scissors you
might end up with an uneven cut which
can potentially cause leaks and
particularly in cases where you're not
using compression fittings it can look
cosmetically not very appealing
now some people do this some people
don't
I like the d5 pump or the mCP 6 v 5 from
Swift tech unfortunately it has
half-inch Barb's integrated you can buy
an aftermarket top that you can change
out the fittings on but I usually don't
do that what I do is I stretch my 3/8
tubing over the half-inch barbs it does
require a little bit of elbow grease
however there's a couple tricks that you
can use to make it easier
number one is boil a cup of water then
soak the tubing in it for even about
five seconds and then try and go at it
if that then doesn't work then soak it
again stretch it in four different
directions using a pair of pliers soak
it again and try one more time now I can
pretty much guarantee you'll be able to
get it on there there's one trick though
guys remembered no matter how hard you
stretch the tubing I always recommend
using a retention mechanism of some sort
whether it's a plastic clip a
compression fitting or even a zip tie so
make sure that you put something on
there to prevent leaks in the future it
should be noted that if
the tubing routing in the basement looks
a little weird it's because I'm trying
to have water go in the bottom and out
the top of radiators whatever possible
it makes it much easier for the air to
travel up through it and then be driven
out of it even though we don't have a
super-powerful pump considering the fact
that we have so many components in this
system now when it comes to wiring up
the fans this is the point where I would
be doing it now you have a ton of
different options there's advanced stuff
like the M cubed T balancer which is
what I use in my own personal machine
allows advanced software curves and
stuff like that it's expensive and it's
quite difficult to set up but for what
we're doing here we're going for a much
simpler option we're using Swift X PWM
splitter which can actually be used to
have PWM control on up to eight fans
with a single motherboard header and a
single molex power connector very cool
little device but we're actually going
to use it in an even simpler fashion so
rather than running the wires up to the
motherboard or anything like that we're
just going to plug it in via molex and
use the included low noise adapters that
come with our Noctua fans will be using
extension cables as well as those
adapters to hook up the three front fans
and the six that are on the radiators in
the basement alright so we Jen that
power supply back in there is a little
bit tricky but she's in there no problem
we've now got modular cables to deal
with and some implementations are better
than others so we have an aftermarket
individually sleeved cable kit for this
power supply but that doesn't change the
fact that I like the way they've done
their modular cables in general so
instead of just giving you you know 10
connectors on the back of the power
supply and 10 cables and you can unplug
your plug in as many as you want
courser goes well they bought a 1200
watt power supply they're probably going
to need most of the cables anyway so
instead they give you options in terms
of what kinds of connectors you want so
for example the PCI Express connectors
you can either have a single two dual
connector so that's specifically for
running to a graphics card so that you
don't have to run two discrete cables or
you can have a one to one connector
which is great for things like an
auxiliary connector on a motherboard or
a 6 pin PCI Express connector on say for
example a sound card like what we've got
so we can have the best of both worlds
we don't have extra you know plugs
hanging off
things and we don't have to run extra
wires we ran our 24-pin and pretty much
the standard fashion it should be noted
that this case has a ton of cable
management room so we were able to get
away with crossing you know connector
harnesses in the back and we're still
going to be able to close the side panel
but if you have a case that doesn't have
quite so much room you're going to want
to be careful to make sure everything's
laying flat in the back and use cable
ties to tidy things up last but not
least we connected our eight pin
connector to the CPU up in the well not
to the CPU to the motherboard but it's
the CPU connector and it should be noted
we only plugged in one eight pin CPU
connector even though it has another
spot for an additional four pin that
additional four pin is optional and it
is my personal belief that on an LGA
1150 platform unless you go on liquid
nitrogen there's no way you're going to
exceed the current that can be delivered
by a single eight pin so we're going to
leave it at that and there you have it
my friends that is how you install five
radiators in the nine hundred DN still
have room for two harddrive cages giving
you a total of four three and a half
inch drives or two and a half inch
drives potentially so what we had to do
was we had to mark off a couple spots on
the motherboard tray so normally you
wouldn't put a radiator there but we
were like well we want to put more
radiators we want more drives no big
deal so we marked off a couple spots
there discovered that that really wasn't
strong enough to hold up our radiator
with the three Noctua fans loaded on to
it of course in the optimal
configuration we've pre-installed all of
our fittings and all of that good stuff
so we added a third mounting point just
to the side of the drive cages we found
with three mounting points that was good
enough but if we could get some other
more different custom brackets we could
probably actually a fix it to this
radiator on the top here as well and
then we could get a really really solid
mount for it but guys honestly we're
going to take this build apart when
we're done so you can come up with
something a bit more elegant we just
used L brackets from Home Depot with
some self-tapping screws to drill into
things as well as little washers for
making fine adjustments to the fit and
finish to make sure that it's sitting
there correctly we're wiring up all the
fans in the top of the system so the
four on the top the one at the back and
the three in our motherboard tray
radiator to the motherboard itself
so the ones on the bottom are all going
to be static according to how we
installed them and the ones on the top
will be able to be controlled using AI
suite just as a reminder guys we're
running 2 until 5:20 series SSDs in raid
zero and we're running 2wd three
terabyte red drives so these are Nazz or
raid operation optimized drives in raid
1 for safe storage because we have more
bays we can either leave them for now
and expand our storage later or we could
actually run up to 4 drives right off
the bat for our storage array in fact
you could probably run six and just hide
these SSDs somewhere if you wanted but
for the sake of doing things by the book
which we haven't done up until now we're
going to install them in the actual
drive cages now you've got a couple of
different options here for installation
so number one is the two different types
of SATA cables that are included with
your board there's straight ones and
right angle ones go with on an
individual drive basis whatever makes
for the most natural run without kinking
the cable then for power we
unfortunately don't have as many options
as I would like corsair only includes 4
port harnesses 4 SATA power i wouldn't
have minded seeing them include a couple
of two port harnesses so you have the
option to use those because we're going
to use a single 4 port one to run to our
drives here in the front of the case
then for our optical drive up in the top
we're going to have to run a full
additional 4 port harness in order to
get power up there it should be noted
once again that I do consider a blu-ray
drive highly optional in a modern
computer but if you want to have it and
there you go we're going to show you how
to install it here just like that and
finally my friends it is time for tubing
we're close to the end when you are sort
of eyeballing out your runs and
measuring them out don't cut extra it's
actually quite difficult to cut the last
sort of three millimeters of extra
tubing that you have that makes it bulge
out funny so you're better off to just
try to cut it as close as you possibly
can and then you know just kind of suck
it up and use another piece if it ends
up being too short because odds are
excellent that especially if you work
from longest pieces to shortest pieces
that you'll be able to use that slightly
too short piece somewhere
so you're not wasting the entire length
of it so I did bring in 20 feet of
tubing to do this but we managed to get
this whole thing plumbed up with less
than 10 feet of tubing which is a kind
of fantastic now there are a few things
needed that few things I want to point
out about the tubing process while you
guys watch this accelerated video number
one is go with the Bend of the tubing
never try to fight it it's much more
likely to kink if you go against the
natural Bend that has been there since
it was originally produced and put onto
a spool number two is that this is one
of the things I have actually come to
really enjoy about the 900 d is there's
the space to do what we're doing here
you can actually run tubing behind the
motherboard tray on this case and get
away with it there's enough space oh
it's a via Harry oh oh that's hard
there's enough space to have tubing back
here and have wires and all that and
you're still going to be able to close
that side panel which is pretty unique
there's not too many cases out there wow
it's heavy though that are going to be
quite like that alright next thing I
wanted to mention is that yeah the way
we did it is not really that optimal
buying all straight fittings and then
just kind of going with the flow and
making it work it doesn't work
necessarily as well as buying things
like angled fittings that's the way that
you might be able to get cleaner runs
for example here around the CPU socket
without having so many unsightly bends
but I think we did pretty well
considering the lower cost of straight
fittings
I mean bearing in mind we already spent
about a thousand dollars on the liquid
cooling setup for this computer like do
we need to spend another couple hundred
on fittings I don't know it's up to you
but we went with pretty basic fittings
and and then the fact as well that we
don't have to do like a Google Sketchup
model of the system just to find out if
the fittings are all going to actually
work together the way that we intend now
before filling the system there are a
couple of different schools of thought
for a couple of things number one is
preparing the system so many people
believe in cleaning out the radiators
with hot water and a
vinegar solution before you even
assemble anything it is a good idea
there can be residue left over in them
from manufacturing that is easy to
remove if you flush prior to building
the other thing is which coolant to use
I personally am an advocate of colored
tubing with clear distilled water simple
no dyes or anything fancy like that if
you want to have a biocidal agent I
suggest putting a chunk of silver into
your reservoir and just calling that a
day as opposed to using clear tubes and
a bunch of dyes I've just seen them gunk
up too many times I'm sure there's good
ones out there but that is my personal
approach this is just a random bottle
from some fessor coolant that I use to
put distilled water and you can get at
the grocery store it's pretty
inexpensive what we can all agree on
however is the procedure of using a
separate power supply or unplugging your
existing power supply from all the
sensitive components inside in order to
prime the system so that is to say what
you'll do is you'll get like some kind
of conductive piece of something so I
usually bend a paperclip you bridge the
green pin on your power supply and if
you can't find which one's the green
power on your power supply say for
example if you have a custom sleeved one
like this then you can check out manuals
online or diagrams online so you bridge
the green pin with any black pin on the
power supply then you are able to easily
control the on/off functionality with
the switch at the back it will
automatically turn on anytime you have
the on switch on at the back so what
that means is you can plug this into
just the pump and you it allows you to
do the quick cycles that you need in
order to fill the loop so basically what
you'll do in this case I've taken an
extra scrap piece of tubing and I've
attached another fitting to the top of
my reservoir so that I can fill it so
you'll fill up your reservoir as much as
you possibly can just like this then
cycle the power on so that all the
liquid comes out of the reservoir and is
taken somewhere else in your loop your
pump should be gravity fed if you set up
your loop correctly it should be the
next component and nowhere for air
bubbles to get trapped then what you do
is fill it up again
cycle the power again as soon as that
res is empty turn the power back off and
rinse and repeat rinse because water
near the end of your filling adventure
you're going to get to a point where the
reservoir isn't full yet but the water
cycles continuously without the pump
sounding like it's not working properly
you never want your pump to run dry
that's really bad but once we get to
this point what we can do is we can
actually leave the system running while
we top-up the reservoir the rest of the
way I recommend leaving it in this state
without any of the components actually
powered on and risking getting shorted
out and damaged for at least 6 to 24
hours maybe even 48 hours if you want to
be super sure what you can do to prevent
water from dripping under any loose
fittings or anything like that on your
valuable components is use folded up
paper towel then come back and inspect
it frequently to see if anything is
dripping water and leaking inside your
system now we were careful to install
all of our SATA cables into the Intel
chipset on this particular motherboard
the Intel chipset SATA ports they're all
say 2 6 with this generation of products
so you don't have to worry about which
two of the Intel ones to get the best
speed out of your SSDs for example
setting up raid 0 is a snap once you've
got raid enabled within the BIOS all you
do is press ctrl I to enter the
configuration utility where we can
configure our SSDs as raid 0 and our
hard drives as raid 1 from there we can
install Windows off of a USB Drive or
off of a CD and I've covered this topic
before in the past guys were finally
done here she is was it worth all the
work I guess it's up to you was it worth
all the money I guess that's up to you -
is this the system I would build
personally the answer is no but what was
the benefit why did we put 17 Noctua
fans running at low rpm well here here's
my microphone I'm gonna point that at
the system you can't hear it over the
refrigerator that's running like 2
meters to my right that way it is
extremely quiet it also runs extremely
cool in spite of the fact that we
haven't even optimized
this 900 d for airflow by removing
things like these solid covering panels
that are down on the bottom we have done
absolutely nothing to optimize the build
and it still runs like a champ
that gtx titan has been running the
combustor overclocking stress tests for
about 15 minutes now and the GPU is
running at 40 degrees celsius unfreaking
believable so that is the point of a
system like this
it's totally overkill it's totally
unnecessary
you could get similar performance for
half the price well maybe not half the
price but significantly less so for all
of you in the comments saying oh he
could have done yes I know absolutely I
know the point of this was we wanted to
show you guys the most overkill build we
could so we put 5 radiators in a 900 d
we put dual Titans in a 900 d we put a
4770k in there we loaded up with 32 gigs
of 2400 mega Hertz memory but again kind
of unnecessary but it's for fun it's for
looks I personally think it looks
awesome
the only things I'd change probably
about the appearance are maybe I'd take
out the optical drive and that was also
the reason we didn't install the OC
panel from Asus so that fits into a five
and a quarter inch Bay you can run this
externally as well so you can just sit
it on your desk or or you can installed
it in the five and a quarter inch bay if
you don't mind that I would also
probably add some BitFenix alchemy
lighting strips I really like these the
the defect rate on them is very low
compared to other LED strips that I've
used in the past where some of the LEDs
will start to fade very quickly we've
had very good luck with the alchemy ones
so we definitely recommend them around
here and man guys I'm going to sort of
ramble for a bit here while you can
check out some glam footage of the
system here there were some challenges
with this system any time you strive to
do something that's really out of the
ordinary you can expect there to be some
hiccups I wasn't actually expecting to
get all five radiators in it at first
because I had kind of looked it up and
I'd gone ah ok supports five radiators
didn't really think about it that much
you know called up alpha cool I was like
hey guys I need this this this and this
and then I got it here and I realized
the triple in the front doesn't fit
natively if you also have a quadruple
and a double in the bottom so that was
where we came up with the idea to mount
it on the motherboard tray which
actually
is pretty effective because it's going
to be able to take in some of the intake
air from those front three 120
millimeter fans and it gives you still
more radiator surface area we also had
some definite challenges with respect to
fittings and water cooling tubing and
getting everything to fit just right
because it's uh it's pretty tight in
there but it was a lot of fun to build
we actually didn't undo that many things
along the line and I'm extremely pleased
with how effectively we were able to
fill up a 900 d to the point where it
doesn't look empty in there which is
what most of the 900 D builds I see look
like they just look like the case is so
big and there's not enough in there we
were able to fill it up with stuff that
actually made sense like what I'd
probably do as well as I'd use all six
of those front Bay's for hard drives and
then I moved the SSDs around to the back
of the motherboard tray where there is
still tons of room because there's just
a ton of cable management room in this
particular case it's a very cool build
but it's also extremely heavy to the
point where I'm not exactly some kind of
muscle man so me saying I can't move it
might not mean anything to you but I
would have a difficult time moving this
system around unaided it has five
radiators hard drives heavy copy copper
water blocks and it has over two litres
of coolant in it so it is extremely
extremely heavy thank you guys very much
