claiming that you no longer need a bulky
and heavy mirrorless or DSLR camera to
get professional-grade results out of
your photography so to test this claim
once and for all we've put together what
I would call a pretty unique challenge
it's going to be me versus Brandon but
the fight won't exactly be fair Brandon
will be using the pixel 3 the pixel 3
while I will be equipped with the GFX 50
are from Fujifilm a 51 megapixel what's
it called medium format format so to put
this in perspective guys this is the
tool you would use for fashion
photography or like taking the kind of
picture that would get blown up to the
size of a building and Brandon gets a
pixel 3 summer break just started but
it's never too early to start looking
for a new laptop for back-to-school
every words in PC laptop is ready for
whatever games or school projects you're
gonna tackle and you can check out their
special deals at the link below
nice I mean like hey that's my only
that's the only thing I got going from
here like this thing is I forgot how
small the pixel is to begin with like
hey guys ready for your first challenge
yeah I guess so Andy hand them the
envelope I feel like I'm on Amazing Race
there's one envelopes we couldn't afford
to end all right photo challenge number
one the action shot for this challenge
you will be judged on these three
criteria the sense of speed your photo
conveys your use of foreground and
background contrast the clarity of the
action you will have two laps of track
to capture a single best photo gentlemen
turn on your cameras and May the photo
best photo wind turn around okay hang on
wait what okay well hold on I don't even
know how to turn on the camera so this
is a 23 millimeter I think that means
it's a prime this is I think my aperture
oh my god
my camera is ready yeah smart guy you
act like you're happy about this but I
know you'd rather be using this oh my
god this doesn't seem to do focus I
don't think this is changing focus I
really need to know how focus works also
this lens is like fisheye I don't okay I
need to change my lens wow that is a big
sensor oh that is hot I think I want my
longer lens for this one I want lots of
background blur okay what do I do
hold on a second that goes there no no
no red dot - red dot okay I shouldn't
help you I shouldn't I got this don't
worry white balance is set to underwater
who the hell did that were they trying
to pop me
highlight tone shadow tone what is this
inori's reduction - - let's set that to
default I don't have a lot of confidence
in Linus's ability to take photos at the
same time
oh I think it's I think it's Auto focus
that medium format Fuji I've been using
for like three months
it's amazing okay I just hold the
shutter halfway down I know this uh how
do I pick a focus point it's a touch no
go away Brandon you aren't helping I'm
not gonna help you I just like watching
you suffer I'm gonna turn HDR off
because I think that for action you
don't really need and I'm not not quite
sure how the processing will handle the
motion blur if James is gonna be running
so I really have no idea better to just
leave it off oh I have to unlock are we
gonna actually do this challenge ever
shut up I'm working on it so where do we
go I'll let you go first it's all in the
hips I'm as ready as I'm gonna be
okay I didn't even get a picture I'm
gonna have to get out ahead of him
one one laughing laughing okay yeah yeah
sure I'm fat so this is one of my images
it's a picture of the track at my feet
that was really hard like I knew I
wasn't gonna know how to operate the
camera but the part that I didn't
account for was being having to get in
position against a moving target I mean
I guess that is the challenge is Brandon
has the know-how and I have the better
equipment okay Brandon you're up three
two one go uh see the way he stands up
doesn't he deal with that yeah no
kidding
it's my whole strategy of like trying to
just wait for the parts where James was
in good light didn't work out quite how
I thought because I've never done that
400 meters sprint while somebody I'll
try to take a photo of somebody and
surprisingly that's not that easy to do
no I think I'm pretty happy with that
last shot that I got because with a
little bit of editing and a crop I think
it'll look pretty good because I'm
getting that nice like texture of the
building area and the lines from the
track this has also shown me that maybe
I should take up running there's a
little bit of shape when it comes to
that I feel good though
like overall like I could have done
maybe a little bit better but I'm
feeling good okay then it's like a fun
house in here is it there's a is that is
that the trophy for whoever wins this oh
my god it is amazing photographer genius
hey wait this is a reused trophy this is
from nerd sports okay so what is your
challenge editorial fashion photography
Alan Lord is the glitz and glamour of
the photo world you need to use the
lights the space and most importantly
the star to capture the raw emotion with
an outfit conveys and to sell that merch
I'm so excited oh my god for this
challenge you'll be judged on how much
the judges actually want to buy the
clothes presented well I think that's a
foregone conclusion yeah I think that's
decided for us already you have 15
minutes with the star to get three
photos of three different merch items
that's not a lot of time I'll be honest
I'm pretty ready for this next one you
only use the lights that are on that set
but you can use any props any chairs
anything else
that you find inside this room I think
you should go first this time okay all
right go ahead Brendan leave the room
oh okay can't watch me use these lights
and then you got to watch me go around
the track that was different
there's no parameters of helpfulness
there for me okay : you ready for this
put your pants on Oh put your pants on
here put this shirt on don't force it to
be a sexy shoot see how this goes sexy
hold on
okay so Colton sit down hold that like
in front of me something more
interesting than this okay drink from
the water bottle like how and then give
me like your sexiest like what sexy
David Hasselhoff stare hold the Hat like
this like grab to it two sides no I just
hold on the Swart whoops okay oh you're
killing it what's my expression you're
about to watch the last episode of Game
of Thrones when you were actually
excited about it sit button yeah so sit

background think about being the French
girl you're the French girl okay cool

same time okay hold this okay yeah there
you go perfect Colton hold on
and the noise to me come back to me turn
back to me here alright
that was hard
holy crap oh my god this experience was
weird because it was with my coworker
but I had like I started with all my
clothes off wait not all of them I had
my boxers anyway so this is just it's
just weird I think Brandi did a great
job
I mean Brandon does his stuff all the
time so like he's just a he's a
natural-born professional
so I love Colton we work together for
like four years having him be a model is
it is a weird turn to our relationship
but no it was fun
he's a lot of fun fingers crossed anyway
that I managed to pull something that
was good off
so Brandon better watch out because I
spent the last 15 minutes going through
the menus of this camera and I wouldn't
call myself an expert but I figured out
how to change the ISO now so I've got
that going for me
but now go Oh God look I'm thinking
right now I need to figure out how to
get you in focus and then we're gonna go
from there I'm gonna move this though
because he looks kind of too dramatic
right now I'm into more like you know

on my LinkedIn
here we go there's a lot of dog stuff on
the table that's exciting this is weird
does this mean I could have brought my
dog to work today challenge number three
it's photography aftering still life may
seem easy but the Devils in the details
for this challenge you were tasked with
capturing the most appealing photography
of drumroll dog food you have ten
minutes see at one photo this is
literally a silver can with gaff tape
that says dog guys we don't even have
that much to work with can I get a spoon
to like okay anything in the room well
I'm gonna use the - dog food dishes you
said I could use anything in this room
I'm gonna let you do this one first
because I I want to just listen from a
distance how you deal with because
you've never had a dog you have cats I
have a dog when I was a kid oh you did
okay and it's not complicated I got dog
food works how am I supposed to make
this look appetizing what now I have to
think yet I was actually feeling okay
about the last couple of challenges but
this one I'm deeply worried about like
if you guys gave us a meal that's
actually nice that might have been nice
okay so maybe we don't have him eating
it maybe he's just present and he looks
happy so we've got the tail up
this looks disgusting I mean can I warm
it up I think it'll help sure yeah you
don't think warming this stuff is gonna
help it's gonna help a lot I need to get
all this camera crap off here what am I
supposed to do with this see if I
remember how to use the bloody camera
this smells so bad
look at this it's like juicy I'm mixing
it I don't think you guys could make
this look appetizing either what if I
put like a small garnish this is
lipstick on a pig if I've ever seen it
my battery dead this is not working
maybe I do need dog things this is
stupid
this is like dirty just anything else I
can use to like presented this is
actually the worst thing I've ever done
[Laughter]
it's over boy okay oh my god Jesus oh
this is gross oh it's hard
Jesus Oh Oh God Oh No
anyway
hey I'm done falling it you know as good
as as appetizing is you can make dog
food I mean I have a dog she's small and
she'd probably love eating that photo
challenge number for the professional
headshot one of the most reliable ways
to make some quick cash as a starting
photographers to offer headshots
although it seems easy it demands a
steady confident hand which is why
you'll be shooting from a moving car you
are in charge of directing the subject
to produce a pose and expression that we
get the most appeal to a potential
client
you get three drive-bys at twenty
kilometres an hour
oh god I'm so glad you're going first
because I need to figure out how to
change my shutter speed wait I have to
drive the car don't I yep James loves
taking his shirt off I'm gonna ask him
to take his shirt off and give me a like
a sexy pose is that a headshot though
it's a tinder profile picture tinder
profile picture we're going for a tinder
profile picture yeah sexy pose headshot
hey Isis ready to drive and you want the
tire on that line in the road right okay
I'll do my best friend and no promises
though oh my god okay rumours perverts
okay so guys that was seven kilometers
an hour and I think that's probably pods
yeah
Oh God
okay all right I have three photo I see
what Brandon was doing I don't think he
was using your strengths you like taking
your shirt off right oh so you're uh
you're a pickup kind of guy clean but
not too clean
you've got the button-up shirt but it's
over the shoulder oh my god I wish I
could just use this right now yeah just
oh don't move let's go let's go oh wow
I have a photo hell yeah I don't know
which one of us is gonna come up with
this okay
that was probably one of the hardest
photos that I've ever had to try to take
like just technically speaking this was
not a good performance I'm not blaming
you James you did your best
you did great James 100% 110% great so
you're ready for challenge number five
yeah I'm not gonna lie I felt pretty
good about the first two the third one I
never stood a chance and that last one
you're gonna be embarrassed for me how
badly I bombed it
all right well we'll see how number five
goes then as far as I'm concerned this
could go either way right now yes it
could very much so
challenge number five the couples
photographer as a photographer it's
often your job to capture the important
moments in your clients lives for your
final challenge you'll have to use all
your skills to create a series of
beautiful unique and intimate pregnancy
photos of the only couple of good all
out is that what the pregnant cast was
for oh okay that's clever so then you
can expense it to work but you get the
pregnant cast well people I don't know
it this is a kit that exists people
clearly want them so you don't do it
with a bra on I couldn't have my wife's
actual nipples on Colton you're trying
to go first okay
how long do I have 15 minutes and how
many photos do it just one three three
photos well the good news is I've
already got my camera dialed in for
direct sunlight photos here oops that's
not what I meant to do dang it okay okay
come on over here guys I've got a little
clearing here okay

closer James can you get sort of
unnaturally close like I know you're at

months pregnant you like just did it

okay so then your legs are here do you
need help getting your legs are out here
and you're laying across this lap
quickly quickly okay perfect I'm calling

pretty challenging to work with good
luck good luck yeah stand both of you

more towards James okay oh yeah see much
too much too much

stand right here
I'm just trying to think like this one
minute buddy just start taking pictures
James
Colton stand here James sit sit at his
put your head against his belly both you
look in my direction
cool all right I'm done it's fine
this was far harder but I think I
actually managed to get a couple shots
that I'm pretty happy with so we'll see
how honest ed welcome back to LTT
scrapyard cupcake drag-racing island we
have just made our way through five
grueling challenges where our two
contestants have faced off using a pixel
three and a GFX 50 our adjudicating this
panel is three experts in the field
first Etzel Yogo second David go Jay
haha and third Dennis liao
I love charging who will vanquish their
foe we'll find out next that's mine I
asked Hoffman to enhance it but he said
he didn't have time yeah you didn't the
end of your photos so I really like the
contrast with the track in the green but
then the green kind of mixes in with the
trees behind him what was I supposed to
do what I'm wearing a weird outfit I
think that's what you're supposed to use
your imagination for you could have
gotten a higher shots that lure of the
track was behind them you could have
gone this is my lowest Leslie
I'm just fair the sizing you okay you
can't really argue it's done one of the
criteria was kind of the whole
backgrounds contrast versus the
foreground and I think you do's James it
does feel like he's posing it doesn't
feel like it's quite capturing the
subtleties of what Jane was
accomplishing on that day the way that
the light is hitting his face I don't
particularly love and I think I might
have chosen a different part of the
track I use photographer okay you're not
supposed to even know who took which
photos so you should probably just judge
the photo obviously you took this
picture
I like the contract after their outfit
and a great
does that give you a combo now let's
move on to Brandon's photo technically
speaking I think this one is a better
photo than the other one just
technically I like yours better I'm not
sure if I'm looking at the guy or the
stands I wish you could have captured it
where the track was a uniform color and
there wasn't the blue but overall I
think this is actually an excellent
photo and the stuff does pretty pop up
but it's a little bit dark
he looks happier than yours I think
where this one kind of fails is that I
don't see the merge so I don't know what
I'm buying you did a good photo here but
I don't think it quite sells the merge
to me I would argue that most of the
best advertisements just look like
people having fun using the thing and
are not focused on the product well then
it's good you're not judging your own
photos you're just not showing much of
other products more about accordance
face which is not important I think we
have a very biased judge in the panel it
looks like he's happy and just doing
something the problem is I don't know
what it is I want to buy interesting
idea of having your subject posing the
background but I don't see enough of him
so I get my like my fancy tickled but
not quite satisfied and so it's not a
bad photo but don't love this one well I
appreciate the logo being visible the
Hat on that dark table doesn't tell me
anything about how it fits I think it
was a waste of having your model in the
back and not wearing it I don't like
this one either so I really like this
photo
I think it's lots of fun you use the
sandals which i think is excellent I
think that's a great use of part of our
branding and so I really like this I
think there's obviously a little bit of
trouble with the exposure the fun more
than makes up for it and I'd love this
photo kotas face is a little bit hot on
his right side told us just a hot guy as
a consumer if I see this on your website
I wouldn't want to buy this who do I
want to buy as a pair of
jeans for him to wear this picture
actually sells me on something the best
from what I've seen so far I can see
myself being in that hoodie excellent
I also don't wear pants all the time so
I think it's a good smile but yeah it's
just an OK photo I actually I like this
picture
among though the others than the best
cuz I like the happiness he's praying to
me
so just watching this picture I want to
buy two water bottles while all the
other pictures kind of let me imagine
myself I would never be going like this
with my water ball and I just dreams
corporate to me I still like the idea of
this photo I think it's fun to be
playing with the water bottle and I
think it's important to sell merge with
fun not just style and I think you did a
good job getting a good performance out
of Colton as an ad for the water bottle
this is kind of terrible I think it's
actually out of focus his eyes kind of
look a little dead or scary or something
yeah I don't think you nailed it on this
photo the logos and the designs actually
really popped with his face he's like
really surprised that he got this free
shirt or something this photo again
feels like it's a salesman holding up
one thing that he wants me to buy it
happens to be that in fairness to
Brandon but it doesn't make me want to
buy it it doesn't make me picture myself
wearing it and I actually thought that
could have been a towel actually this
picture is amazing you can see the
fleece after he looks pretty tasty I
know I'm not supposed to eat pet food
but they are selling it to me and I'm
not sure if it's actually pet food but
it it looks good when you microwave the
food during the challenge I was a little
concerned for your sanity but you proved
me wrong and it actually made it kind of
come together and look a little more
appetizing you're trying to tell the
audience that the stock where you have
too much going on this
I like the other colors that contrast
with the bowl and the food but it does
seem kind of distracting and the food
doesn't look like food I like the pose I
like the arm crossing it looks like he's
trying to sell me a house or maybe
trying to sell me renovation services
that are probably consider buying the
lighting is a little bit off I think it
lose his eyes but I think you did a
really good job considering you're
sitting in the back seat of a car and so
good job I would not buy a building from
this guy he looks a bit Shady the
framing so K could be better
unlinked and maybe that work so I love
this photo maybe for the wrong reasons I
think you were going for tinder profile
you succeeded I think using the pickup
as a background instead of trying to
find a neutral space was a strong choice
for Tina profile yeah you can see a lot
of other pictures like this but you
might be single forever because of such
a douchey look like for a one-night
stand you seems like a pretty good
choice a relationship probably not I
want to print this on a canvas I want to
put it up in my house I want to make
this a movie poster I want to make it
the cover of my 17 love songs of 2004
album and so overall as a set I think
it's good there's so much diversity they
look they're having fun and man that
last photo is excellent I love it you
can feel that moment just quiet and
happiness the marriage is good is
working out
I wouldn't ask for the full refund but I
might ask for a discount because it's a
little bit over suppose if I were
pregnant or my partner was pregnant who
really cares if like a picture is
perfect but has no emotion this has all
of the emotion and it's good enough this
one ended up being by far my best photo
we are gonna print it on a disk plate I
think this is a really strong set and as
individual photos you might have beaten
Linus on any of them except for the last
one that one's so good but as a set
they're kind of like OneNote I love the
colors I think like the exposure is good
I think the emotion of this is pretty
good but then they're in the same
and so now I can see more of the world
and I like this field but it's kind of
the same photo just like zoomed out as a
set it doesn't tell the story
Lance's pictures I like for about a
married couple but this couple looks
like are not getting divorced I don't
feel that happiness however the client I
think it's the wrong emotion it makes me
feel like they just got some bad news
that they're they're going to lose the
babies thank you so much for your photos
excellent job to both of you and so good
job guys thank you gentlemen

did an excellent job

lioness very one-sided competition
honestly like your photo of James I
liked way more than mine if we'd had

would have crushed me on every single
challenge I was crazy lucky more than
once even around the track yep that was
the one action shot that I had that was
remotely in focus
