personal gaming rig and it's actually
served me really well for the last three
years at the time the specs were pretty
blazed and fast it had an Extreme
Edition eight core processor calling
eight cores extreme these days seems
kind of quaint and a Titan X graphics
card but because it uses in videos old
Maxwell architecture this Titan graphics
card not only is much slower than modern
gaming cards actually lacks a bunch of
really cool features like their updated
video encoder as well as you know RTX
real time ray tracing so today's video
is all about upgrading it but here's the
thing I don't have time to spend
literally a year designing a custom
paint job for the front okay I didn't
design that but admittedly I do think it
looks cool and a completely custom
enclosure for full loop water cooling in
a rack mount chassis that ain't
happening so today's gonna be all about
well if I'm being honest playing a no
eighteen hundred because I got that game
it ran like garbage on my 34 40 by 1440
monitor and so I reached out to a orison
Nvidia who put together this little care
package that's going to take us from
very very last gen to pretty much the
fastest it gets IBM is giving away 1500
DJI Telo drones to enter to win complete
the IBM developer challenge no prior
coding knowledge is required and the
contest is open to residents of the US
Canada UK and Spain you got to be 18
years of age so check it out at the link
below
so I guess we'll start with a little
classic unboxing of what has to be one
of the coolest motherboard products to
come down the pipe in in my opinion at
least to the last year or so this is the
gigabyte z3 9da horas extreme what they
call it water force 5g and what's
special about it is that this is like an
$1,100 motherboard or something crazy
like that but it's also not as insane as
it might sound because unlike most
motherboards this one actually includes
a prebend and pre overclocked CPU so
check this out the board actually comes
with the CPU pre-installed so it's a
core I 999 hundred K that's been
validated for 5.1 gigahertz it's got all
the usual features you'd expect a
handful of m2s SLI support three PCIe
16x slots oh this could throw a bit of a
monkey wrench in the pudding we've got a
side mounted 24 pin hopefully that fits
my case is a little unconventional but
right what's more interesting than all
the features it has is what it doesn't
have check that out
bear chipset check that out we've got
bear VRMs there's no cooling on this
board what kind of crazy person would
buy $1,000 motherboard with absolutely
no cooling on it whatsoever so it turns
out what I was looking for was actually
in a clearly labeled separate box this
is the ARS all-in-one monoblock so oh a
monoblock is basically a single block
that is designed to cool multiple
different components so this one right
here is designed to cool check this out
the CPU the vrm components all three of
your MDOT two drives and the chipset it
weighs probably like oh my goodness like
a kilo or two
and it looks like it includes not one
but two RGB lighting leads here's one
and here's what appears to be another
one although I'm not a hundred percent
sure if that's right here we've got a
bracket and a rubber because when you
got this much sex appeal you never know
what might accidentally happened am i
right my friends and then we've got a
bunch of a bunch of supplies for
screwing so our first order of business
then is mounting the monoblock to the
motherboard okay and now we start to put
in screws one pro tip for installing any
kind of block whether it's an individual
CPU block or some kind of a mono block
whether it's graphics or full
motherboard is you never want to go in
too tight so I'm just putting these in a
little bit to make sure they're not
cross threaded I am basically not
tightening them at all just holding them
in place I've determined that the
washers are for these screws not by
reading the manual of course but by just
noticing that they are either plastic or
they're coated and otherwise these
screws would be going into a bare PCB
which could cause a short because
they're just normal metal screws so
these washers then are serving two
purposes one is to make sure that it
doesn't short out the second purpose of
these washers is to ensure that the
screws don't accidentally loosen over
time you might not realize this but the
inside of a computer can have a lot of
vibrations whether it's from fans or
spinning disks and unless you've got
Loctite and/or washers on anything that
you've mounted it is possible for them
to vibrate loose over time Wow
so as much as it kills me to bid adieu
to my limited edition gold-plated CPU
block this is pretty spiffy looking so
now I've got to take apart my old rig
alright so the first thing we're gonna
do is pop out both the GPU and CPU it's
one of the things I love about soft
tubing is that it is super quick
Julie to get your entire loop removed
for system maintenance there we go so
that gives me completely unfettered
access to my motherboard area here's my
Intel NIC these days every motherboard
that's worth its salt chips with a
better network card than this so I'll be
I'll be leaving this behind you know
it's funny I would say one of the most
notable things about this machine is how
not out-of-date certain components are I
mean Corsair only replaced the ax 1500 I
think like six months ago and even then
the 1600 I yeah it's it's better but
it's not like you know a quantum leap
forward and power supply performance or
anything like that and I actually will
still get to reuse my Dominator ddr4 in
here so this is a 64 gig kit of Cass 15
memory yeah it only runs at 2666
designed for Gen 6 I 5s and i7 but hey
if it fits ice it's right I mean to be
clear I'm not expecting XMP profiles to
work or anything like that but it should
function now a lot of people get into
newfangled coolants with you know
colorants or additives or whatever else
but I have always been a proponent of
straight up water and I will show you
guys why because even with plain water
you can see that the flow over time like
water will erode pretty much anything
we've managed to strip the nickel
plating from some parts of this block
exposing the original copper also even
with pure water although that is with a
couple of drops of biocide we still get
a little bit of like you know corrosion
and stuff like that but what you don't
see is any microbial growth because the
thing is a little bit of corrosion or a
little bit of erosion which is what
we're looking at here is not going to
kill your system microbial growth that
will dunk up your blocks like that and
it is pretty much game over it's funny
it feels like such a downgrade going
from the h EDT or the high end desktop
platform of your to a mainstream
solution but not only does this consumer
you know mainstream CPU have just as
many processing course they are so much
faster than my old rig that I'm
expecting and CPU alone a double digits
performance uplift it's not so now that
our motherboards in we're ready for the
main event of this upgrade so this is it
looks so good I almost feel bad taking
the like sexy air-cooled shroud outfit
but we definitely have to do that so
this is part of Corsairs entire new
lineup of full custom water cooling
products it took them a long time to
enter this segment of the market but
they've been a big name in the a i/o
cooler space for a long time so I'm
excited to see just how this new
endeavor works out for them overall I
have to say I'm not like my initial
impressions of the of the build quality
don't really blow me away like
especially when you compare the stock
backplate which is like this thick
friggin thing this looks very plain and
kind of flimsy by comparison also their
block seems to be designed to help save
them some copper because this shroud on
the outside while very stylish and sexy
looking is made of aluminum which is
quite a lot cheaper and then they've
also gone with some kind of molded
plastic for the fittings up here that is
so this saves them like a lot of copper
but when you compare that to the
high-end blocks from other manufacturers
it really sets them behind in terms of
build quality okay so here's the
situation I've got the board cleaned up
so we're pretty much ready to mount man
that is a big GPU full
couple key developments we've got the
Corsair block installed actually on the
card it looks pretty sharp I will give
them that
not bad Corsair not bad
so our GPU is gonna go in here and then
out like this a little something like
that so let's go ahead and plug in the
motherboard first so I actually had the
length of this cable done up custom for
this case and the old motherboard so
that means it's gonna be a little bit
wonky now go ahead and pop that in there
the good news is that it fits I was
really worried that this reservoir
bracket was gonna interfere but it like
just barely fits on there so that's
pretty sick all right GPU is going in my
original tube here might make it that
looks so tacky I love it so much it's
horrible
that's it ladies and gentlemen that is
my upgraded personal rig until I upgrade
anything else about it
however oh oh that's heavy that's really
really heavy ah one moment please
all right so I borrowed a power cable I
found my trusty mini funnel and we are
ready to fill this puppy
whoo there goes oh it's backwards
wait there may actually still be time to
rectify this one moment if I flip it up
onto its faceplate you can see the water
draining out of the CPU block there see
that now the GPU doesn't matter doesn't
care which way it flows but our CPU
block does so what we need to do is we
need to get a new run that goes from
here to here instead and from here to
here
of course that would be cruel and
unusual punishment if we didn't at least
see if it runs the game well and also if
it works so I grabbed Riley's monitor
off his desk which happens to be the
exact model that I used for gaming at
home and we're gonna go ahead and fire
this baby up
hey there where's my keyboard and mouse
all right
mm options oh look at that it defaulted
me to lot's of crazy settings that's
cool okay I will just load up this
sandbox game alright oh that is so much
better so by comparison with my old
system I was running at medium details
and I was chugging down to as low as
like 40 FPS now there's actually a
framerate counter up in the top left
here I'm at Ultra everything except I
turned anti-aliasing down to 2x and I'm
hovering in the 45 to 70 frames per
second which is fine for a game like
this more than fine especially if you're
running a g-sync monitor thanks to IBM
