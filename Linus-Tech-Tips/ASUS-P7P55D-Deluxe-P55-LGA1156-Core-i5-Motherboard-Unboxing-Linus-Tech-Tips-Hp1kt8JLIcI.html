way to our last a soos p55 board to
unbox we've got the P 7 P 55 D deluxe
board so what's the difference between
this and all the other boards well it's
got 16 plus plus 3 phase power for the
CPU so that's better than any of the
other a seuss boards now you've also got
support now the Evo has this - but
you've got support for drive expert
which is an automatic Drive backup
solution so there's that other relevant
stuff there not really much of anything
in there but let's get this board open
okay so all right you've got the turbo V
remote so this is a hardware level
overclocking button so you can actually
increase decrease your bus speed and
you've got a few different presets turbo
key can turn it on so that plugs into
the back of your i/o shield speaking of
i/o shields here's the i/o shield so
there's the turbo connector spot there
we go
pretty cool so then you've got your
manual your drivers and applications DVD
then we've got okay six SATA cables
three right angle three straight then
we've got USB and eSATA IO bracket then
we've got an SLI bridge the Q connector
things for USG and for your front case
connectors then we've got an IDE cable
let's get this board out so you will
notice that it looks very similar to all
of us uses other p55 boards they've gone
with a fairly unified looking theme and
let's see if we can find the difference
between this and their other boards so
first thing let's have a look at the
general layout here's your two slots for
crossfire and SLI so it's 8 X 8 X if
you're running two cards and then this
one will run at 4x electrical off of the
chipset which has a different looking
cooler on it this is actually pretty
looking it's very very shiny and nice
yeah I kind of like that anyway so then
we've got one two three four five six
seven eight nine SATA ports so we've got
six on a right angle here and then three
down at the bottom of the board you've
got your onboard power and reset
switches and then you've got your memo
okay switch and then up here you've got
little toggle switches for over volting
the RAM
the IMC that's the memory controller or
the uncor and then the CPU so you
probably won't be playing around with
those unless you and extreme overclocker
you've got your power connectors in the
usual places 24-pin on the right-hand
edge and a pin up at the top left and
they're using they're actually there's a
heat pipe in between they're cool like
ice fortress looking PWM coolers so
there you can see there's your 16 phase
power around your CPU socket here's the
connector for that turbo turbo connector
thingamajiggy and then that I guess
comes out a little place at the back and
then here we go let's have a look at the
back i/o so you've got your ps2 keyboard
and mouse there's your clear CMOS switch
then you've got 8 USB ports digital
audio out 2 Gigabit Ethernet 1 firewire
and 7.1 audio conspicuously missing is
eSATA support very strange for a premium
board like this anyway thank you for
checking out my video blog on the p7 p55
D deluxe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
