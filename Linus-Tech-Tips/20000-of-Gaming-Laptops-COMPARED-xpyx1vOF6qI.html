laptop who would be crazy enough to do
that ha ha ha
Asus Sager Acer and msi that's right my
friends the laptops in our gaming
roundup today are not for the faint of
heart or the faint of wallet between
them they have a total of 8 gtx 1080s in
them and they cost over $20,000
the white dark Bass Pro 900 from be
quiet features a modular design to
support a variety of layouts and
configurations check it out at the link
below let's meet the contestants
starting with the NP 98-73 from Sager
the og of mobile sli it's rockin a core
i7 6700 K CPU making it the only machine
with a 6th generation Core processor but
it's also the only one using a desktop
CPU so that might end up being an
advantage
next is the msi gt80 3 titan sli whose
Cherry MX mechanical keyboard and 18
point 4 inch display make it suitable
for use as a weapon moving on we've got
the Asus GX 800 whose highlights include
a 4 kg sync display and hohoho yes an
outboard water cooling unit which might
give it an edge when we overclocked
these suckers later and finally coming
in at a whopping 9 thousand dollars the
most bunker Doodles laptop that we have
ever laid our hands on with a curved
ultra wide 120 Hertz g-sync display a
full mechanical keyboard and an included
Pelican case for transport the Acer
predator 21 X the test environment for
this showdown
was our conference room held at 21
degrees and for all of the tests we set
all factory overclocking modes and fan
speeds to max loud yes unpleasantly loud
also yes but the goal of this video to
use a car analogy is to watch them drag
race not to discuss the resolution of
their backup cameras so for our first
test we wanted to see which of these
beasts could sustain the highest CPU
clock speed under a full load so we ran
an IEEE 264 stress test for 15 minutes
then took the average temperature clock
speed and power draw in watts for the
next 5
after an ear-shattering quarter of an
hour a winner emerged and if you guessed
that the laptop with water cooling had
the best cooling results you would be
totally incorrect actually believe it or
not the laptop that best tamed its
quad-core CPU was the Sager NP 98-73
coming in at just under 4 gigahertz
average now you might remember from our
review that the GX 800 was able to
operate at 4.1 gigahertz but remember we
were using their overclocking software
to overclock and that required some
under volting a Seuss's factory
overclock is a little bit too generous
with the voltage perhaps even more
surprising than the clock speed winner
is the fact that in spite of their size
none of these devices ran at a
comfortable temperature at these clock
speeds with the predator 21 X being the
most frequent throttler with occasional
trips down to 800 megahertz time for a
Cinebench speed run where thanks to the
quick duration of the test the GX 800
pulled out a convincing victory with a
score of 946 just ahead of the predator
21 X single threaded results were a
similar story but of course if you've
got this much money to spend on a gaming
laptop you've probably got a separate
workstation for all of that kind of
stuff so let's get to the gaming results
all tests were done at 1080p ultra
details and with FX a enabled for an
apples to apples comparison in rise of
the Tomb Raider DirectX 12 the GX 800
pulled off a clear win and the predator
21 X showed the value of tweaking
factory settings by disabling acer's
predator software and slowing our
overclocked down to turbo we actually
managed to solve some fairly unpleasant
stuttering issues so we'll use these
settings for the rest of our tests in
DirectX 11 we see a different story the
Sager NP 98-73
stomped all over the other laptops
putting up similar numbers to DirectX 12
while the rest took a big hit the story
remained the same in Deus Ex as well
with the water-cooled GX
proving that once again it's the king of
directx12
and with the sagar taking the crown in
DirectX 11 there must be something about
DirectX 11 that favors its desktop CPU
while the mobile chips are being more
effectively used in the newer API a
hypothesis that was strengthened when
the csgo scores favored the Sager
once again our last gaming test is for
honored where the overall trend of the
video continues to not be a thing weird
so the predator 21x takes home its first
victory here leading us to conclude then
that if you're shopping for the fastest
fastest laptop out there there isn't
going to be a clear winner in every
possible category onto battery life then
it was well what did you guys really
expect it was a poop show there gaming
laptops not thinning lights leading us
then to conclusion time the only laptop
that didn't bring home a single medal
was the msi gt80 3 titan but it was also
the most consistent performer across the
board thanks to its lower clock speeds
and less frequent thermal throttling
maybe MSI's engineers figured the extra
performance wouldn't matter anyway
because of its 1080p 60 Hertz display so
as usual it's not as simple as which one
is the fastest the GX 800 might look
like an obvious choice but if you want
to use the external dock to get an
estimated 10 percent performance boost
it literally requires you to carry
around a luggage to keep it in and the
Sager might look compelling on paper but
it is probably the most obnoxious
sounding of all of them while gaming for
all of these laptops the factors I just
listed and so many more ultimately
impact the gaming experience so the
beauty of any one of them is really in
the eye of the beholder meaning that the
only way for us to declare a clear
winner here is to ignore subjective
factors and focus entirely on objective
ones
bringing us to our final recommendation
a gaming desktop and a more portable
laptop and you could probably throw in
an e GP you for your portable laptop
