the Phantom 410 crafted mid-tower
chassis from NZXT this is basically like
the Phantom but more smaller um and
we're going to go ahead and open this
bad boy up and taking us take a look at
it if you guys remember my original
video you probably already know that I
am a big fan of the NZXT phantom I think
it's a fantastic case I think it is by
far out of all of their cases so far
with ok at the time of release I thought
it was by far their best case although I
would say that they shoot what is that
one over there because I really like
this one ah this is the tempest ah The
Tempest for 10 or for something the
tempest for whatever it is is also a
phenomenal case but because I love the
Phantom original so much I am very very
excited to take a look at the slightly
smaller more compact version of it so
let's go ahead open this thing up it
comes in a fairly thick that's actually
a right quite a thick foam although this
is a hard phone I do prefer softer foam
because they are more resilient to
multiple impacts I are more resilient to
more resistant to multiple impact more
resilient against multiple impacts but
not resilient to ah
and just a second someone's out the door
sorry guys that was the crazy Russian
bringing back one of my crazy video
cards that he borrowed so here we find a
very very much well actually I'm very
surprised at how much smaller this is
than the original Phantom this is
definitely a mid tower case whereas the
Phantom was more of a full tower case
and I have to say that without looking
closer at it I have not done yet I have
to wonder if there's enough space in
here for the kind of epically awesome
gaming hardware that I would want to put
inside a case that looks as slick as
this one so let's go ahead remove all
these plastic bits and let's have a look
at the outside first before we really
get any further so the front looks
pretty much very similar to the original
phantom I'm gonna have to figure out how
this opens because I'm not really sure
you guys oh there we go
yeah so it's a clicky device okay just
press on there so we've got three five
and a quarter inch bays okay front
ventilation looks really good we've got
a 120 millimeter fan that not only has
full access to this grill in front of it
but also has unrestricted airflow from
the bottom as well so you're not going
to have to worry about whether that fan
is going to be starved and there's also
no grill directly in front of it so that
is going to make it operate quieter as
well as making it capable of pushing
more airflow although it is restricted
on the other side of it so once we open
it up we'll see how much overall
restriction there is also looking at the
bottom you can see it's lifted quite a
fair bit off of the table or whatever
surface that it's sitting on this is an
awesome design decision because it means
that this fan hole right here as well as
the fan for the power supply are not
going to be starved for air because
they'll have air coming in from both
sides here in order to to cool whatever
components are on the other side so
rubber feet here keep it from slipping
around and let's go ahead and make our
way at the top so here's our power LED
as well as our hard drive LED power
switch and reset switch or right here
we've got our headphones and microphone
jacks two USB two two USB three and then
a built-in fan controller just like the
original phantom one two three settings
and on the top we find tons of
ventilation space those look like 140mm
fans yeah that's a 140 ml fan and
another 140 millimeter fan slot although
this this case does not look to be
capable of hold open oh it is okay well
we'll get to that after that
we have a side window which right now
has plastic on the other side of it so
it's not as transparent as it will be as
well as side ventilation so you can put
either a 120 or 140 millimeter fan right
here I want to take a moment for you
guys to have a look at how closely
they've managed to match the color
actually up here is probably a better
example how closely they've matched the
color and finish between the painted
surfaces and the plastic surfaces this
is very difficult to do during the
manufacturing process and they've done a
fantastic job with this one as well as
with the original phantom on the back
we've got a 120 ml cooling fan water
cooling grommets although most people
won't use those a little bit more
ventilation a bottom mounted power
supply seven slots and that pretty much
does it so let's use the thumb screws
here to open this guy up and I'm going
to need my screwdriver alright so let's
get these side panels off overall
construction feels pretty good that's
encouraging I mean you can usually tell
a little something about the middle of
the case get it metal haha by taking a
close look at the side panels
oh man I'm funny okay ah so there's been
a few screws rolling around inside this
case while we've been doing this uh
unboxing so I'm gonna try and figure out
where these came from although oh I
think I know where they're from wow I
think they managed to come out of here
fascinating so those are your five and a
quarter inch drive mounting screws yeah
you can tell because they use a they use
the smaller threading so you use the
Tula's mechanism and then if you're
actually planning to ship the system
anywhere so here's your tool list and
however it works hold on it comes up
like yeah okay oh yeah yeah you just
lift it up and then you slap the drive
in and then it pops into place and then
you press on here ah there we go press
on there to lift up the clips on this
side so you just put your additional
screw in here
in order to secure the drive in the
event that it's gonna you know be banged
around during shipping or whatever else
okay now the next thing I want to do is
see if I can figure out how to remove
the top okay you know what we'll do that
later we've also got some included
accessories we've got
pleated zip tie here we have six three
and a half inch Bey devices and they're
loaded from the back fascinating
although this top piece can come out
entirely if you take out these screws um
wow there's actually a lot of features
here so we're gonna have to just take it
slow go one by one I'm gonna try not to
get distracted here this and let's get
the last of those screws out there we go
so three and a half inch base there we
go you can see they are completely
tooless you just flex them open like
that put the drive in and slide the
whole cage back into the case they're
also compatible with two and a half inch
drives using these mounting holes here I
definitely prefer this system to other
ones that just use two pieces on either
side and don't have compatibility for
two and a half inch devices on the side
you can see the other screw holes for
the five and a quarter inch base as well
as these pressure mounts which add some
resistance when you're inserting the
drive so that you can easily use the
tool list mounting option here we have
our bottom three and a quarter three and
a half inch drive cages and I'm going to
flip it back around show you guys why
those are important because this top
piece comes out entirely in order to
accommodate graphics cards that are the
almost the entire length of this chassis
so that is a very very cool feature you
can also remember I talked about how
restrictive the air flow was at the
front of the case for that front fan so
we're going to go ahead and remove the
front bezel just so that you guys can
have a closer look at what I was talking
about there here we go one there we go
two and three comes off so you guys can
see what I'm talking about here because
these cages are a little on the
restrictive side however you can install
an additional 120 millimeter fan which
is going to give you some more airflow
there you are going to be able to push
some air through them and then in order
to get more static pressure going on you
can also install an additional fan
whether you want it to be a 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter on this
side to give you some additional flow
towards your graphics card or cards
assuming that you have the space so most
graphics cards I mean look this is a
Romans card this is a 69 70 are 69 50
rather most graphics cards once I
install that is going to have just
enough room for that fan to go on the
inside and be installed however if
you're putting something crazy like a 69
90 in there then you're going to run
into trouble potentially okay so this is
just a piece that allows us to pull that
out here we have our CPU cut out here we
have our top mounted 140 mm fan this can
be replaced with either dual 140 mils or
dual 120 mils and if you wanted to mount
a radiator I wonder if you could get
away with it it looks like you could so
check this out so if we remember so
because I don't have a dual 120 mil rad
handy I'm going to use a quad in order
to provide a simulation of how this will
work so you can see all these different
mounting roles they have here that's so
that you can accommodate either the dual
140 s which are these outside ones or
dual 120 s with a radiator so you see
this cutout right here that is so that
the radiator sits with the barbed side
down right here lines up perfectly I can
tell from here that it's just fine and
then all you do is you put your case top
back on and the radiator sits down there
the fans continue to go where they
already did so that's on the inside of
the case and now you are cooling your
radiator you have a liquid cooled
computer and they haven't wasted any
space in this case overall because like
I said due to the small size of it I
wasn't sure how much hardware we were
going to be able to put in here but it
looks like the answer is a whole lot
because you can see they've made it just
a little bit bulkier in the back so you
have that space that ghetto booty so to
speak bulkier in the back for the dual
120 millimeter ah radiator and if you
have a 240 millimeter radiator I
definitely envy you so let's go ahead
and take a look at the motherboard tray
we've got our cable management grommets
right here here and here we've also got
a cutout right here for the 8 pin
connector I wouldn't mind seeing that
widened a little bit although hey
there's one here as well ok there you go
so you'll be able to reach whether the 8
pin connectors more in the middle of the
board or more at the edge good thinking
and zxt
ah standard ATX seven expansion slots I
think we're getting pretty darn close to
the end of this although it's got a lot
of different features hey you guys all
right
Oh what do we got here okay we got power
for the built-in fan speed controller
we've got four leads for the built-in
fan speed controller very nice we've got
our front panel connectors our front USB
connector our front USB 2 and finally
our front HD audio I think that covers
it this is an awesome little chassis I'm
going to give it my Goldstar of approval
