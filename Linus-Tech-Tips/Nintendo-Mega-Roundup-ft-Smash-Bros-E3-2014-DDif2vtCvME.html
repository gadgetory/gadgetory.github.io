brought to you by hyperx fury series

alright guys I know as the pc master
race that we like to thump on the next
gen consoles a little bit but everyone
seems to be fairly okay with Nintendo
and we you so want to cover some games
while we're here we use game libraries a
lot stronger than the next gen consoles
anyways and they have tons of new games
coming on the way for example they have
been at a one and two Kirby and the
rainbow curse Yoshi's woolly world
captain toad treasure tracker smash for
3ds and Wii U Mario Party 10 mar vs.
Donkey Kong Hyrule warriors Mario maker
and finally splatoon if that's not a
crazy line up I'm not sure what is and
we're going to check out a few of them
here so stay tuned first off is smash
and I expect anyone to care about this
than most there's coming out on Wii U
and 3ds and 2ds or whatever but I'm
going to start out with Wii U so on the
wii u it's it's a very nice experience
extremely smooth the animations are
great the freeze frames on different
attacks are awesome really really nice
experience I had a great time if you're
interested in negatives though I talked
to some pretty high level competitive
players actually played against some of
the invitational guys for the tournament
that was here and I got some feedback
from them in terms of negatives everyone
knows this game's gonna be awesome so
what are the downsides they said it
would be nice if they could reduce lag
on aerial moves if they could reduce
boundaries so you die a little bit
earlier when you get thrown off if you
there was more options for moves out of
dash and there's more combos out of
throws interesting feedback not stuff
that I necessarily notice because i'm
kind of a noob but if you are a pretty
high little smash player that's what the
competitive guys are saying so that
might matter to you but that being said
all these things seem pretty easy to fix
so if they are actually major problems a
Nintendo does seem to be taking feedback
those developers walking around this
whole time talking to people they can
fix these things fairly easily I do
believe so I wouldn't be too worried
about it let me come to Mario maker and
Mario maker you're able to take any of
the general elements that would be in a
platformer Mario game and build your own
level out of it again I got to play with
some of the
competitive players from smash and they
made some pretty insane levels that were
almost unbeatable but we were able to
get through it and then I played myself
and made a level that I felt was
actually kind of realistic but still
very difficult and it's it's amazing how
smooth and easy it is having all of the
possible options being able to easily
extend pipes and make them whatever size
you want and just very simple
instructions being able to flip
graphical styles from a classic to a
more modern style and any of that kind
of stuff is a lot of fun it's amazing
how in-depth this game is for how early
in development it is one thing I asked
about was if you were going to be able
to download community map so if someone
made a map that was really popular to be
able to download it not necessarily
implemented yet but they've had a lot of
that feedback so far so I wouldn't be
surprised if they had it in the final
release of the game next up is Yoshi's
woolly world it was a lot of fun it's
kind of like a cuter game but it's not
as easy as you might expect right off
the bat I got a warning from the guy
that was standing right there that some
people take it don't take it too
seriously and then just get completely
owned so I went in pretty seriously and
it wasn't actually that easy it's a lot
of fun the different mechanics in the
game are very surprising and if you're a
fan of Yoshi like I am for sure I play
Yoshi mark rat ate all the time you're
probably going to enjoy the game it's
kind of like having Yoshi permanently
when playing mario there are very
interesting ways that it includes that
the yarn style you have a certain amount
of yarn that can follow you at any time
and you can use them as projectiles to
break three different parts of the map
and manipulate the map as you go forward
