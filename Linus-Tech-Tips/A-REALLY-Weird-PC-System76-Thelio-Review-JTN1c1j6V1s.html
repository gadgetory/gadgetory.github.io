low spec one or something that was
designed and built from the ground up to
bring Linux to the folks who can't be
bothered to compile their own kernel
hunt down all the right repos or even
build their own PC it challenges so many
of my own assumptions about the Linux
community like for starters wouldn't
anyone with the time and inclination to
tinker around with Linux also have the
time and inclination to install it for
themselves in the first place so it
seems like the goal here is to make
Linux more accessible to normies so
let's go through this together and I
want to see your comments down below
about what they got right and what they
got wrong Moss has updated their packs
once again an inversion for they've got
a ton of changes making it a combination
between their Grande and their black
pack buy it today at the link in the
video description
starting with the system76 webstore the
goal was clearly to simplify the
shopping experience they offer both AMD
and Intel platforms with a huge amount
of customization but they boil their
thelia system offerings down to three
models a good better best if you will
with the system upgrades presented in a
way that is simple but might actually
bother many hardware enthusiasts for
example the mat pro 27 inch IPS display
has no model number listed whatsoever
and this 30 terabyte hard drive is just
six five terabyte hard drives with no
indication as to how they're going to be
configured prior to shipping now we're
gonna talk about our hardware config and
a little bit but first as a non Linux
user I want to poke around pop OS a
little bit when you first boot it is
super easy to encrypt your data just
enter a password and reboot that is
pretty neat then when you come back
you're given the opportunity to set up
your online accounts for integration
into the OS including access to your
Google Drive cloud storage right in the
file manager now we've actually seen pop
OS before in our gaming on Linux update
video and one of its major departures
from its parent Ubuntu is pop shop a
ridiculously easy to use app store so
it's actually ported over from
elementary OS but with one key value add
system 76 curates their own packages so
if you ever need something basic like
steam for gaming or the latest in video
drivers it's just a click away
actually for your graphics drivers it's
easier than updating them on Windows the
only real criticisms that we had were
the lack of UI scaling by default on our
27-inch 4k display and the way that our
secondary storage drive won that shipped
in our system was kind of hidden away we
think this should be front and center
like the cloud storages so hopefully
they fix that soon as for if you need to
fix anything you can access the pop oh s
recovery environment that lives on the
boot drive by holding
down space or escape during boot this is
a full copy of the installation media
meaning that you get a live environment
to access and backup your files refresh
your installation or even just nuke it
and start over from scratch and this is
all without needing a thumb drive
now one fun idea is that you could
actually use this recovery environment
as a sort of super incognito mode that's
separate from your main install if you
were so inclined now on to the hardware
our figlio is specked out with a rise in
720 700 X and a bunch of other good
stuff so we threw both gaming and
productivity workloads at it where it
not only performed pretty well overall
but in some cases outperformed Windows
and this is on literally exactly the
same hardware now obviously our gaming
results fell a little behind in some
places but what's noteworthy here is
that we're even running these games if
you're not up on the latest in Linux
gaming news I don't blame you but valve
proton enables a huge number of Windows
only games even once that aren't on
Steam to run on Linux now it is
supercool onto productivity now right
now for some workloads like video
editing Linux isn't a great time because
the industry standard tools aren't
available on the platform but for other
things like color work and DaVinci
Resolve our system performed really well
and in some cases absolutely crushed our
windows performance numbers but check
out these blender results if you if I
didn't see it happen I wouldn't believe
that they're on the same processor ok
then so so far we've got good
performance a relatively simple Linux
software implementation green light to
buy them well hold on a second
now we intended for this to be a review
of the system but so far everything
we've shown you can be installed on
commodity hardware that you assemble for
yourself so let's take a closer look at
the box once you get it out of the
shockingly nerdy packaging the most
striking features of the figlio are its
wood green
finish and it's tantalizing silver power
button and accompanying white LED ring
there's no sign of any front i/o to
disrupt the clean design language
they've gone with which means it's
beautiful but also means unfortunately
that we're stuck with what we've got on
the rear and back here is interesting so
more of that clean at any cost approach
the i/o is cut directly out of the
chassis
that means no simple motherboard upgrade
although again it does make for an
uninterrupted premium look that really
screams Apple even though when we pop
the hood with these thumb screws we can
see that this is clearly a standard PC
motherboard on the inside but we can
also see in Harris they've done a pretty
bang-up job with the cable management
helped significantly by the generous
real estate provided under the main
fascia which doesn't attempt to seal the
computer so much as it conceals that
means that there is a bit of concern
from our end about dust accumulation
through the side panels and the
potential for noise to sneak out from
under the chassis using the air gap as
an echo chamber
unfortunately sure enough it does get a
little loud when the fans are running
full tilt and it's not just whooshing
air noise something that we generally
don't complain about rather it's a kind
of droning whine that's a little bit
harder to tune out honestly I think a
Noctua or a be quiet fan swap would help
tremendously here because it seems to be
that the arctic freezer 12 CPU cooler is
making most of the racket and that might
also help with thermals our Rison 720
700 X stayed cool enough to prevent
throttling but at 85 degrees under full
synthetic load I would prefer something
a little beefier as for our EVGA
graphics card well that was right where
we wanted it in spite of the diminutive
size of our chassis despite its acoustic
shortcomings though the interior of the
figlio does carry the same level of
polish and attention to detail as the
exterior so the CPU cooler shroud is
both stylish and practical pulling
double duty as a guide for the CPU
coolers exhaust and as a bracket for
mounting a chassis
and similarly the gpus retention bracket
acts as a brace to protect board flex
check this out - up top we've got this
row of screws weird right well they're
here for a reason
this hot-swap drive Bay allows you to
just push out this clip slide however
many screws you need down the rail and
then screw them into the drive line up
plug in and it couldn't be simpler and
you don't even need to worry about
losing the box of case screws that was
included with your system the only issue
here is that you better forget about
mounting a full size three and a half
inch drive two and a half inch SSDs and
hard drives only also we haven't gotten
to the coolest thing about this yet the
case and all of its accompanying bits
and pieces open-source just like the
operating system so there's literally a
github page with the CAD files for
everything that you see here and for its
bigger brothers the figlio major and
figlio massive now that's not to say
that every component in the system is
open-source the motherboard CPU Ram
video card storage devices and power
supply are all proprietary in design
with the IP owned by the individual
companies that made them but system76
says that they're developing their own
firmware
wherever they can in order to make the
hardware as open as possible
something that they've already done with
their laptops which are otherwise just
standard clever designs this openness
comes at a cost though Aarthi leo starts
at $1100 it sounds reasonable but that's
a really basic config the spec we ended
up with costs quite a bit more and with
the standard warranty we came to just
shy of 2,400 dollars when we compared
that to specking out the exact same
system components for ourselves - the
case our total came to $1,000 less whoof
so then case aside what are you getting
for that thousand dollar difference well
while the operating system itself may be
free system76
does have paid staff that actively
developed their OS and that's to say
nothing of the user support commitments
that come along with that perhaps most
crucially though the figlio chassis
manufacturer and final assembly are both
done in Colorado by a team that's about
our size so no mass production system 76
says they want to improve this situation
in the future but for now it means that
the costs add up really quickly so to
sum it up you're paying for the case us
manufacturer
operating system development and support
from a small team of enthusiasts now
whether the design and concept of a well
integrated Linux desktop is enough to
make you pay the extra that's a choice I
leave to you but overall we think it's
really cool and a huge step in the right
direction
