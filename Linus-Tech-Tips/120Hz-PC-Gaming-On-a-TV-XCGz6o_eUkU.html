just for console players or at least
they did Nvidia at CES 2018 got the PC
gaming world super excited about big
screen gaming when they showed off their
65 inch big format gaming displays or
BFG DS and then promptly gave the entire
community a serious case of the blue
balls when they announced that they
wouldn't be coming until sometime later
this year
well what if you don't want to wait
until later this year good news because
mostly under the radar there has been a
way to get high refresh rate gaming in
your living room on a big-screen TV
for months the Vizio P Series runs at
120 Hertz and you can buy one today but
there are some compromises so are they
worth it or should you keep waiting
world of warships is a free to play
historical online combat game from
wargaming featuring an exciting blend of
action and strategic gameplay stay tuned
later in the video for an exclusive
offer
so the 65-inch variant of is iou's
flagship piece series behind me here
uses a VA panel that means that you can
expect good if not industry-leading
viewing angles color gamut and overall
image quality but and this is important
for gamers
it also means better pixel response
times than a typical IPS and at normal
viewing positions those other
disadvantages melt away somewhat in
light of its 120 Hertz capability so
it's pretty compelling at least on the
surface but it still requires some
further investigation high advertised TV
refresh rates are typically just motion
interpolation an effect that
subjectively looks terrible and
objectively introduces additional input
leg so it's really bad for gaming but I
mean the panel itself like many TVs
today runs at a hundred and twenty Hertz
natively so what that means is that if a
manufacturer chooses to expose it
separate from any motion compensation
nonsense which by the way the P series
doesn't have any way the TV can and will
accept and display a true 120 Hertz
input with a catch HDMI 1.4 doesn't
provide enough bandwidth to run 120
Hertz at our panels native 4k resolution
so we're stuck at 1080p but I mean if
you've ever played around with a retina
resolution calculator you probably know
that unless you've got eagle eyes the
difference between 1080p and 4k on a 65
inch TV can be difficult to discern from
further than about ten feet away so this
might still be viable but we need to
answer some questions first will 1080p
to 4k scaling cause blur and quality
degradation how is the input latency of
this display in its various modes and
what about the rest of its features so
to answer we grabbed our test bench and
our 8k high frame rate red camera and a
seat
the couch we started with our biggest
problem with other TVs input latency and
we're happy to report that at a hundred
and twenty Hertz in game mode it was
basically imperceptible subjectively
speaking it was actually pretty close to
other 120 Hertz displays that we've
tested and using our makey makey we
measured an average end-to-end delay of
roughly 40 milliseconds regardless of
game mode so it could be better but it
is definitely acceptable bumping up our
resolution though we see a jump to 78
milliseconds though it should be noted
as well that this was with game mode on
and at 4k game mode did end up making a
difference so this is still not too
shabby for a TV and it's fine for casual
games but to say we could tell the
difference between high refresh rate
mode and 4k would be an understatement
as for image quality again it's pretty
good it's not OLED but it's blacks are
deep and thanks to the hundred and
twenty eight zones of local dimming
contrast stays high even when it's
dealing with small bright objects on a
dark background the app experience is
really cool it's got a built-in
chromecast that Vizio is calling Smart
cast and it pairs quickly with Bluetooth
4.0 and uses Wi-Fi to actually do
everything from powering the TV on and
off to accessing all of its settings so
fire up that app turn the sharpness
setting to zero and for the most part
enjoy your TV for the most part the
scaler well it's not horrible but it's
not gonna blow anybody away either it is
certainly no M cable though with that
said if you're using your TV with a PC
as we're kind of proposing here you may
actually prefer it that way since it
does prevent the text anomalies that the
M cable can produce in its current form
now with five HDMI 's and a component
input though we aren't stuck with PC
gaming all the time modern consoles will
run about like you'd expect so actually
better than a typical 60 Hertz TV with
high input lag but not as good as
switching to 120 Hertz on a PC
and as for retro content well at lower
resolutions you'll see a big drop in
quality as expected blurry text and
characters with no obvious way to
improve it and unfortunately that
sharpest function doesn't help it just
puts a sharpest filter over top of it
and as for 720 and 1080 P modes on a
super NT we actually got pretty clean
results TLDR if you can pre scale your
retro games you will actually get some
pretty darn good results here and in
fast 2d games it gets especially good if
you enable the clear action backlight
strobing function this reduces visible
motion blur at the cost of some
brightness so bottom line then
high-performance big screen gaming what
do you do well LG actually has a couple
of OLED models the c7 and b7 that have
this same 1080 120 Hertz functionality
but I would recommend against gaming on
oh let's not just those ones but in
general because bright static on-screen
elements like HUDs or speedometers are
very very likely to cause permanent
burnin bring your options then back to
the P series here are waiting for
invidious partners like a soos with
their BFG DS so with a BFG D you get
variable refresh rate with G sync which
is kind of a big deal you get 120 Hertz
at full 4k resolution assuming you have
the hardware to run it and you get even
lower input leg with an Nvidia shield
console built-in however with the vizio
you get instant gratification because
it's available now a well above average
big screen gaming experience and a
pretty darn good TV overall also if my
speculation is anywhere near correct and
I think it is you also get a price that
is anywhere from one half to a third of
what Nvidia solution will costs so the P
series is actually looking pretty darn
good let us know in the comments which
one you'd prefer
