while ago we called it to gamers one CPU
you can check it out here where we've
got one gaming tower with a couple
graphics cards in it extreme edition
processor all that stuff and it runs two
separate instances of Star Wars
Battlefront
and we used a software for that called
unread that while they kind of came back
to us and we're like yeah that's really
cool they were also kind of throwing in
hey but that isn't really the point for
most people and so they decided to
sponsor a video where we show off a more
practical application for this
virtualization technology that led us
front to gaming rigs in one tower and
this time instead of using crazy
overkill hardware we're using I'd say
enthusiasts but not completely
over-the-top stuff to have a single
gaming rig pulled double duty as a
gaming rig and also as the file server
for the rest of the household so stay
tuned guys we're going to be doing a
gaming rig and an AZ in one box
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting check
out the link in the video description to
learn more so let's go through the
rationale of all the hardware while we
assemble the computer itself for our CPU
we chose a core i7 6700 case skylake
processor in any case where you're going
to be using virtualization you will a
need a CPU that supports virtualization
and B want one with more cores and or
more threads so hyper threading on the
CPU is a definite boon we're going to be
installing that in easy 170 Deluxe
motherboard from Asus it's a fully
featured board and has lots of PCI
Express Lanes and dual LAN if you you
know wanted to team your NICs or
something along those lines in the
future and also has the virtualization
support that we need in terms of RAM
ddr4 is all you're going to be able to
use in this case the speed doesn't
really matter however the one thing to
note is that the more virtualized
operating systems that you're going to
be using the more you will need in this
case we're just demoing a gaming rig and
an as so there's really no need for us
to go completely overkill so we've gone
with 16 gigs of ram the case was a
pretty tough choice because I wanted
something that would allow for more
harddrive expansion remember this is an
ass also in addition to being a gaming
rig but that wasn't going to compromise
the cooling and/or expansion
capabilities of the gaming rig itself so
I settled on the silverstone teto for
BEW and then silverstone also sent over
a 750 watt power supply giving us lots
of room for hard drive expansion in
terms of the power budget as well as
this is cool so this is a brand new
thing there FS 305 so this is a five by
three and a half inch
toolless hot-swap hard drive cage thing
that we're going to be mounting in the
front of the case this is very Naza
whereas the inside of the case is very
just normal gaming Tower II and I felt
like this combo was a really
really good one which brings us to
storage now we're using Kingston's one
terabyte KC 400 SSDs note that I say
SSDs because we have two of them the
reason for this is that while you could
pick any other capacity of SSD that you
want it is important to have two of them
because this gives us two advantages one
is it protects us in the event of a
hardware failure and two actually that's
really the main advantage on raid is
going to really want you to have these
protected so yes we'll be running them
in a butter FS RAID one next up we've
got our hard drives so we're using
Seagate center prise capacity v5 SATA
hard drives for NAS functionality these
are about as fast and reliable and just
generally ba as it gets but once again
in terms of what you're going to be
using you have a lot of flexibility in
terms of both the hardware as well as
the capacity that you want to go with in
this case at least two drives is
recommended again to keep your nas safe
in the event of a hardware failure but
you get much better scaling in terms of
the capacity per investment if you go to
three drives or more and use a parity
setup versus a RAID one setup so we're
going to have five drives so we can fill
up that front bay device that we have
the video card was an easy choice I
basically grabbed whatever was on my
test bench and threw it in our
motherboard has onboard video so that
takes care of running the web UI for
unread and then that video card is going
to be passed through to our Windows 10
VM for its full
we hope functionality in games we could
use any card AMD Nvidia it really
doesn't matter one challenge we ran into
was that our hot swap cage didn't
actually fit in the front of this case
without removing some small little tab
shelf things designed for normal five
and a quarter inch devices like optical
drives but that was nothing that we
couldn't solve with a little help from
our friend mr. Dremel and our other
friend mr. vacuum-cleaner okay so now
that the system is
physically constructed there's just one
little trick when you're plugging in all
your cables plug your display cable into
the dedicated graphics card for now then
power on the system for the first time
press Delete to get into the BIOS and
we're going to change a couple small
settings here go to advanced system
agent graphics configuration set your
primary display to IGF X and I GPU multi
monitor to disabled this will allow
unread to grab the onboard graphics
leaving the discrete card free for your
gaming VM make sure that if you're
planning to use the unread desktop GUI
you've got your monitor plugged into the
onboard graphics now after you make this
change another small setting that you're
going to have to enable is
virtualization so go ahead and make that
change as well go to another PC and
create a bootable unread USB Drive
according to the instructions on their
site plug that into the back of the
computer and get her booted up once you
reach the web UI go into settings
identification and rename your Tower to
something more recognizable on the
network enable Network Bridge under
network it's normal to lose connectivity
here for a few seconds and then if it
doesn't come back right away use that
recognizable name that you set to
navigate to it in a web browser next
navigate to the main tab and assign
disks to the array and to the cache the
array is your slower larger magnetic
storage devices your hard drives and the
cache is those high-speed solid-state
drives that we installed next start the
array you can see that a parity sync is
running we can start using the system
immediately to continue setting it up
but you should be aware that data on the
array is not protected until the parity
sync is completed this takes quite a
while but it's worth it because it
allows a failed drive to be replaced and
the data to be rebuilt in the event of a
drive failure format the unmount Abyss
'kz please note that this will wipe all
data off the disks then refresh and it
should be done within a few seconds next
let's go over to shares and start
creating we're going to do the nazzer
first and here's some general rules if
you're going to copy
data over the network to this share then
you'll want to enable this share to use
the cache everything else can be default
although minimum free space is kind of
important to set you want to set this to
a value that is larger than the largest
file you could see yourself copying to
the share this will prevent out of space
errors so for example for a media share
you might set this to 25 gigs next we're
going to create another share for
backups for this one we are going to
enable the use of the SSD cache so we
can take advantage of faster local
network transfer speeds remember data
from the cache moves to the array
nightly we're going to create a shadow
play share for gain footage you know
this is supposed to be a gaming machine
and all that but for this one there's no
need to enable the cash because shadow
play won't write more than five
megabytes per second at a time and will
never exceed the speed of the array even
if we turn off the faster writing speed
option
another cool share to create is a game
library share so if you predominantly
use steam you can actually map a network
drive in the OS later and we'll show you
how to do this and throw all of your
Steam games especially the ones that
don't suffer from slow loading times or
that are large or you don't play that
often and throw them on to the magnetic
storage rather than taking up space on
your SSD the last thing that you'll see
here is us setting up our domains and
ISOs shares for VMs we're doing this
manually the same way we did in the to
gamers one CPU video but by the time six
point two goes public beta this will be
done for you and you won't have to worry
about it please note these ones are not
exported which means that they won't be
browsable by other networks attached to
devices this is fine we intend them to
use them on the local machine next we're
going to enable VMs in settings VM
manager click the download button next
to vert IO driver then we need to copy a
Windows ISO this can be downloaded
legally from Microsoft directly to the
ISS folder using another networked
computer in my case I've got it on a USB
stick on this computer in front of me
now this is an advanced and therefore
optional step it's possible to not only
manually assign plugged in USB devices
to your VM before you boot it mice
keyboards XLR audio interfaces etc
but it's also possible to completely
pass through an entire USB controller to
your VM so we through a random dual USB
3 port PCIe card into our system and
we're going to show you guys how we can
pass it through to enable hot plugging
in some cases you'll be able to assign
some of the onboard ports on your
motherboard to your VM while leaving
others to unread to deal with but this
varies from motherboard to motherboard
and platform to platform skylake for
example for the same reason we couldn't
pass through our onboard audio can have
trouble with this using putty a free
tool login to your server using the
unread username root by default then run
this command to see all USB controllers
in the system our NEC PCIe USB device is
the one that we added ourselves the next
command shows us the vendor Product ID
which we've highlighted then we go back
to the unread web GUI and in the main
tab we click the flash device then put
PCI - stub I DS equals and paste the ID
we got from before and hit apply the
system will need to be rebooted at this
stage so stop the array and reboot once
rebooted we can start the array then go
to VMs and add our first VM just click
Windows 10 change the name to what you
want assigned CPU cores I generally
recommend assigning the hyper threaded
cores and the physical cores to the same
assignment we've gone with 12 gigs of
ram for our games and chrome we're going
to pick our Windows installation media
for storage we're going to assign most
of our SSD space to our VM using just a
little bit for our cache then we pick
out our video card we pass through only
the NVIDIA HDMI audio due to iommu
issues with the onboard audio then we're
passing through the USB devices that we
recognize so you'll see three Logitech
ones for our keyboard mouse and USB
gaming headset then that optional step
from before we can pass through our NEC
USB controller which gives us those hot
pluggable ports so we don't have to
restart our VM to plug in a USB Drive or
something along those lines all right so
we are finally finally at the end of our
journey but first this is very important
this HDMI cable comes out of the onboard
video
and goes into our dedicated graphics
card because otherwise when we boot up
the VM there's going to be no video
output because we assigned that
dedicated graphics card to our VM so
here we go
oh yes twelve gigs of system memory
tested ok is amazing so now we install
Windows the way that we just kind of
normally would mostly stay tuned ok so
here's the trick you're going to get to
the point where it asked where you want
to install windows and there's nothing
there so you want to load drivers click
browse and then you're going to navigate
to your CD drive Verte IO win 0 point 1
point 1 then go to the vio store folder
then you're going to go to Windows 8.1
AMD 64 and press ok then next yes third
time's the charm
now we can install windows next so now
that red the desktop you have to install
drivers for any devices that are missing
them so for any of the stuff you don't
recognize you're probably just going to
navigate to your Verdi OU and manually
add drivers and then you're probably
going to want to throw some graphics
drivers on and then actually there's
some other post windows installed tuning
things that you might want to check out
from to gamers 1 CPU but other than that
that's pretty much it so I'll show you
guys how to utilize your array shares to
make mapped network drive so that you
can have all your shadowplay stuff go to
one place so that you can have all of
your Steam games install in another
place but really the sky is the limit
here you can create as many shares
within unright as you want and then you
can map as many network drives as you
want as well any time you want to make
changes you just go into a browser go to
gaming as in our case or whatever it is
that you want to call it and then you've
got access to the entire unread console
to create more shares change any
settings or do things like oh hey I'm
gonna for stop my VM I wouldn't
recommend doing that that'll shut down
the computer you're using immediately so
all that's left now
the day-to-day usability so you can set
your VMs to auto start by just going to
the VMS tab and going yet any time I
turn this machine on I want my gaming
rig to start up and I monitor to turn on
and all that stuff and then yeah I guess
there's a couple little things that you
might want to invest in to make your
life a bit easier like having an extra
keyboard and mouse as well as an extra
display cable so you can use the
multiple inputs of your monitor to
switch if you're desperate and you have
to get it the GUI because you can't
access it over the network or whatever
else but the cost of those items
compared to if you had to buy a
standalone Nazz for your household is
much much lower but of course that would
all be meaningless if the performance of
the finished machine wasn't still you
know pretty much on par with the gaming
machine that you intended to buy for
yourself so let's have a quick look here
boom Crysis 3 my friends and check this
out I'm going to initiate a file
transfer to myself gaming as media and
check this out no framerate dip copying
at 100 megabytes per second and if we
tab out check this out we can even see
real-time stats of what's going on with
our storage and our networking and the
transfers done already so that was fast
so there you have it guys it actually
worked there is more - unread than this
especially if you want to start
tinkering with other virtual machines
and all that kind of stuff but I thought
that this use case scenario was super
applicable to our audience where you've
probably only got you know one be a
gaming rig in the house you probably
have a use for network attached storage
and sharing a off-site backup a lot of
the other functionality that you can dig
a little deeper and get at with docker
containers and stuff like that so being
able to combine that functionality
rather than buying a separate
motherboard separate CPU separate case
separate power supply being able to do
all of that off of one single
high-quality machine I personally think
is pretty darn cool so let us know with
a comment and a like below if you agree
which I guess leads us pretty well into
our sponsor for today's episode Logitech
we've actually had a lot of logitech
stuff going on in here we got the g9 10
or I in spark we've got the g502 proteus
core but the focus today is the g6 33
Artemus spectrum headset it's been
completely redesigned by Logitech from
their previous headsets to be better in
well pretty much every possible way it's
USB with support for surround it's more
comfortable it's more durable it sounds
better and with the that's actually
that's a lot better and monitoring is on
so I can hear myself talking and with
the fold out and extend perfectly
positionable microphone you will sound
better to your gaming friends as well
we've got a link in the video
description where you can learn more
about this puppy you can be like oh yeah
I want to know more about the you know
40 millimeter Pro tuned drivers and I
want to know more about the you know
comfort and the shape of the ear cups
that is actually the shape of ears I
mean does anyone on earth actually have
round ears I don't know I've never
actually seen one so check out that link
in the video description alright thanks
for watching guys if you disliked this
video you know where that button is but
if you liked it hit the like button get
subscribed and maybe even consider I
don't know supporting us by shopping on
Amazon we've got the instructions for
how to do that up there you can also buy
a cool shirt like this one or you can
give us a monthly contribution through
our four and get yourself a nifty little
contributor badge now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering what to watch next and hey how
about you go back and watch to gamers
one CPU if you hadn't already it's also
using on raid but in that case we
actually ignored the nez functionality
entirely and did to gaming VMs off of a
single machine both with pretty much
bare to the metal performance it is
pretty darn impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
