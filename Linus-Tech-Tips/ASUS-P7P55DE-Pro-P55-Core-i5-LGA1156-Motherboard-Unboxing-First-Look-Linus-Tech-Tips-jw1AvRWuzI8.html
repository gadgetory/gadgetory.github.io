quick look at the asou p7 p55
de pro so this is an updated version of
the old P 7 P 55 D Pro and by old I mean
new but not quite old enough to include
or too old to include okay blah blah
blah blah true USB 3.0 and true SATA 6
gigabits per second ban that is your big
selling point for this and a lot of the
other new p55 boards that have been
coming out I mean I know the p55 launch
wasn't that long ago but because these
two new technologies are so important
many of the motherboard manufacturers
are releasing new boards so they can get
on board with those technologies right
away so let's go through what is special
about this board hybrid technology
includes they're easy to an overclocking
Express gate Linux operating system live
EVP whatever okay hybrid processor turbo
we evoke a OC blah blah okay okay here
we go thermal probe so they have
temperature probes in all of the voltage
regulator modules that will adjust for
the power load as well as the
temperature to ensure that you're always
getting the best performance possible
out of them okay next one is the true
USB 3.0 and true SATA 6 gigabits per
second performance that is very cool
obviously and then next is any memories
a okay so it's their memoq a technology
that allows you to post even with
overclocked sort of memory modules now
I'm going to use this chair as a
substitute for a real cameraman here and
adjust it so we can have a look at the
motherboard while we unbox okay so there
is the board box itself let's get it
open okay so the first thing we have
here is the i/o shield it's and one of
those new stylish black isle shields and
you can see they've clearly marked the
two USB 3.0 ports with a white box
around them that's kind of handy because
if you're looking for those it's nice to
have them well smart okay then we have a
USB and ESET there that is awesome I am
so tired of seeing like USB firewire
combo ports I mean you use this firewire
anyway USB eSATA
as seuss has it figured out alright
there is an IDE cable so they've got it
less figured out there's still IDE but
what can you do and we have an SLI
bridge so you can assume that this is an
SLI supporting board
oK we've got their cute connector
technology and then we have four SATA
cables they are black and they are
straight and right-angled there's two of
each okay then we have the user's guide
as well as a driver DVD do not use this
download the latest drivers and well
sorry about that my memory card actually
filled up while I was in the middle of
my unboxing so here is the user guide as
well as the driver DVD don't use that
etc etc and then we have the isuzu
design and DIY features where they're
basically giving you a quick rundown of
all of the cool features that it has so
it has a CPU socket Wow okay it hasn't
been okay we already talked about that
so there's no need to go into that any
further q dim is an out-of-box idea for
easy installation basically that means
that when you're installing memory
modules in this board there's only a
connector on one side very cool I'll
show you more about that in a moment
q-slot is the new retaining mechanism
that a soos has designed to make
removing or removing both video cards
very very easy you can use the pencil
eraser okay
q LED huh that's not really very cool
okay over hold switches this is neat so
there's a hardware switch to actually
enable over volting features and
vertical SATA ports have been around for
a million one year so I'm not too
concerned about that and easy RAM
overclocking modes okay well those have
been around for a while too so you're
like two four six anyway good job Aziz
okay so let's get the board itself out
here so here is the p7p
55 B - B Pro there we go so why don't we
do a quick rundown of the overall
feature set of this particular
motherboard I'm going to move my camera
back a little bit and injustice that you
can have a look here so first of all
here's your LGA 1156 socket that you'll
find on all p55 boards here is your dual
channel ddr3 memory and this is the Q
dim thing they were talking about you
can see that on this side these aren't
actually clips like here have a look
from the side if I can get that in there
yeah these are not clips so you
basically just slide the module in from
this side and then open up the clip put
it in and
clip it in very cool feature actually
okay so here is their 16 phase hybrid
power which is actually 12 plus 2 phases
okay and then you've got your 24 pin
power connector as well as your 8 pin
power connector in their optimal
locations at the edge and top of the
board respectively let's have a look at
the PCI Express layout so if you were
going to use crossfire or SLI on this
motherboard which you could you would be
left with an additional PCIe
a PCI and another PCIe 1x so that's a
pretty ideal layout given that most of
the expansion cards these days are
moving towards PCI Express this isn't a
premium premium board so you're not
gonna find any onboard power buttons or
4 pin CPU or sorry not CPU 4 pin fan
headers or any of that kind of fancy
stuff but it is still fairly
feature-rich as far as the overclocking
features go so actually you know what
let's have a look okay let's have a
quick look these are our SATA 6 gigabits
per second ports so all of the blue ones
are SATA 2 or SATA 3.0 gigabit per
second and then these grey ones down
here are SATA 3 gigabit per second I
think we've covered most of the features
on the front of the board oh yeah here's
the memo k button in case you were
wondering and here's your little dip
switch to over volt the RAM that's also
pretty cool wow that's really hard to
press they don't want you pressing that
by accident that's for sure there's a
quick look at the vrm cooling solution I
kind of like these it's kind of like
they're kind of ice fortress II for lack
of a better word anyway here is the back
of the board the moment you've all been
waiting for
you've got ps2 ports and they were back
to 2 ps2 ports on this board then we
have 6 SATA
arstan 6 SATA 6 USB ports 2.0 and then
we have 2 digital audio ports so we've
got a fire wire and an eSATA and then we
have Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio oh
wait there's more USB 3.0 there they are
so USB 3.0 is up to 5 and gigabit per
second so you're looking at maxing out
any hard drive with a USB 3.0 connection
which makes it actually faster than
eSATA 2 which is very very cool so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
asou sat peace
p55 D - needle FFT dusty Pro thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
