NAB 2017 coverage learn more about the
Mk II two elements gopro microphone and
their other audio for video products at
the link in the video description sony
has really put their stamp on the camera
market over the last few years recently
overtaking nikon in overall full-frame
camera market sales in the US to
continue this momentum sony has
announced the a9 their newest stills
camera that looks to please
photographers looking for a properly pro
body in a mirrorless form factor the a9
sports a 24 megapixel full-frame sensor
that uses their new stacked CMOS sensor
technology the new stack sensor gives
the a9 data processing speeds that are
20 times faster than any previous Sony
full-frame camera in the real world this
amounts to the a9 being able to shoot an
impressive 20 frames per second with a
buffer of up to 241 RAW images or 362
JPEGs Sony is clearly targeting action
sports and wildlife photographers with
specs like that
going up against Canon 1dx mark 2 and
Nikon d5 the highest staples of that
market rounding out the specs the a9 has
693 phase detection autofocus points
that cover 93% of the sensors frame a
three point six eight million oh la de
VF that can run at a brisk 120 frames
per second Sony's 5-axis in-body
stabilization 4k video recording over
sampled from a 6k readout dual SD card
slots and improved battery life with
their new 20 to 80 million power
rechargeable batteries I was impressed
with Sony's blackout free displays on
the camera while also claiming
distortion free silent shooting with the
electronic shutter which allows the
shutter speed of up to 130 mm of a
second for the first time in Sony's
lineup it looks like using the
electronic shutter for its silent
operation is a viable way to shoot with
this camera most of the time allowing
shooting anywhere where the sound of a
mechanical shutter could ruin the moment
you are trying to photograph
golf weddings or wildlife for example
while Sony has included 4k video support
like in the a7 r2 it's a bit
disappointing to see that they have yet
to include a log profile in the a9 which
would have rounded up the cameras video
features very nicely since the new stack
sensor should perform much better in
terms of rolling shutter and the 24
megapixel sensor also makes this a very
compelling hybrid Stills and
camera on paper Sony is likely saving
the more video focused approach for
their next entry in the a7 series of
cameras overall the a9 looks to be very
well placed in the market to take on
Canon and Nikon offerings and at $4,500
it is by no means a cheap camera but for
its target market it does come in $1,500
cheaper than its competition so thank
you guys for watching let me know what
you think of Sony's a 9 in the comments
down below and thanks again to
Sennheiser for sponsoring our coverage
