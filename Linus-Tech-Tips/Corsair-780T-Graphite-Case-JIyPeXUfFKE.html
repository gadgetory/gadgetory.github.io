it's like the 600 T but updated to be
sleeker with like more features and
stuff and then according to the
reviewers guide that's exactly what they
were going for so mission accomplished
Corsair coolermaster v series semi
modular power supplies feature 80 plus
gold efficiency and their gold guarantee
five-year warranty click now to learn
more as always it starts with the box
that goes around the box will your 780 t
reach you in one piece the answer is
most probably the packing foam was
broken in more than one place but ours
had no visible damage on it whatsoever
other than the Corsair badge that fell
off which we then later found and
reattached on to documentation and
accessories Corsairs blown up view of
the case with handy-dandy screw type
reference chart approach works well for
this case but as always you can find a
more complete version online speaking of
screws Corsair includes everything you
need but nothing in the way of eye
catching extras like those cool screw
containers that fantex throws in with
their similarly priced cases which leads
to my first complaint about the case in
the conclusion of this review of the
original 600 t a non-text writer who
happens to be our technical marketing
contact at Corsair now small world says
that compared to its circa 2010
competition the build quality felt
cheaper and that the case was quite
expensive four years later I feel like
it's replacements construction is still
not impressive to me given the fairly
premium price tag cuz I'm just not that
into the plastic look although some
people may feel differently about this
now to be clear I'm not calling the case
bad and since it's a computer tower and
not a support truss in the real world
it'll likely never matter I'm just
saying that much like the 760 T which I
reviewed here and think is an awesome
case by the way the 780 T sacrificed
some structural rigidity to the
convenience and style gods in exchange
for among other things a massive plexi
window that lets you see all the guts in
all their glory stylish plastic feet
that keep the case off the floor so a
bottom mounted radiator or power supply
fan
still get access to fresh air and
reconfigurable drive cages that can be
hung from the top stacked from the
bottom or removed altogether to make
room for a two hundred and eighty or
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator in the front and it's not like
the whole design is impractical anyway
the front has a super easy to remove
filter that reveals two of the included
140 millimeter fans and it's got two
five and a quarter inch bays in case you
still use those at the top we find
another easily removed fan filter this
one revealing room for a thick 280 or
three sixty millimeter radiator and/or
the accompanying fans front USB to front
USB three front audio a too easy to hit
by accident I am oh reset button a3 mode
fan controller that controls up to five
fans and finally the same automobile
design inspired power button that we
first saw on the three ATT a nice touch
a quick glance of the back reveals water
cooling holes another radiator mounting
point pre-populated with the final
included 140 millimeter fan this one
without LEDs and sheesh nine PCI
expansion slots that's enough for a
triple slot card on the bottom of a
standard ATX board a double slot card on
the bottom of an eight slot XL ATX board
or a double slot in Quad SLI on a
standard board with ample breathing room
the 780 T is the 600 T successor in more
ways than just appearance this bad boy
is meant to be a perfect choice for
extreme systems running air cooling
which doesn't mean that it lacks liquid
cooling options either in addition to
the mounting point I already mentioned
to the bottom of the case along with its
front and rear access filters has a
final 240 millimeter radiator mounting
slot that you can use if you don't need
your hard drive cages down there alright
so let's crack her open shall we the
side panels can be released with handle
style latches on either side and the
first thing I notice is man this thing
suffers I'll be it to a lesser degree
than the 900 d from hardware dwarfish
ism a condition that makes even high-end
hardware like this gtx 780 Ti and asus
WS motherboard look tiny inside it this
room ent
is going to be a dream for folks with
large hands or who want to throw
additional stuff that Corsair didn't
think of inside like motherboard tray
mounted cylinder reservoirs other than
sheer spaciousness
there's nothing terribly groundbreaking
about the interior though I like
Corsairs removable two and a half inch
tooless mounts I like the high quality
rubber grommet material
I like the adjustable height rear fan
mount and I really like the extremely
spacious cable management area behind
the motherboard tray with ample cable
management loops another 600 G carry
over but at closer to $200 then to 150
there are also a few things I feel like
could have been improved so here come
the nitpicky complaints some cable
management could have been a bit better
the front audio connector is long enough
to connect to your neighbours PC and the
top mounted fans have only one place
where wires can be routed but unless
you're using the long leads on the cases
built-in fan control or extensions to
your motherboard it might not be very
easy to access this is an issue for me
because while I appreciate the built-in
fan speed toggle one of the reasons I'm
partial to suits motherboards is they're
excellent on-board fan control and this
case makes it slightly less convenient
to use which leads to nitpick number two
there are two cable management grommet
locations that I feel were left out of
the motherboard tray top center and
bottom right
almost every board has a CPU fan header
in the top center and front panel
connectors bottom right I'm guessing
that these were left out to maintain as
much structural rigidity as possible
given the way that the motherboard tray
free balls without support from those
removable hard drive cages but I still
would have liked to have them which ties
into nitpick three the hard drive cages
I know we're stuck with them for a while
because courser has so many cases that
use the design but I promise to keep
complaining about Corsairs three and a
half inch cages until they stop using
them or everyone on earth stops using
hard drives and switches over to SSDs
whichever of those two things happens to
come first which I guess leads us pretty
well into conclusion time the 780 T is
good but it didn't blow me away with its
striking industrial design but we the
760
he did it's good but not amazing and I
also think they missed a huge
opportunity to make the cable management
look fantastic by putting a basement
separation in this case rather than this
open area with its kind of cheesy SATA
cable management hole on the bottom
that leaves the wires not only exposed
but even visible through the large side
panel window all of that said I feel
obliged to remind longtime viewers of my
show and tell the new ones but I tend to
go a little hard on Corsair because my
expectations of them are so high based
on their history of innovation so take
all these complaints in the appropriate
context if anyone but Corsair had
released this case I would have likely
overlooked most of these flaws and
praised the case as an enthusiast air
coolers delight with some surprisingly
solid build options for liquid coolers -
and a striking industrial design with
smooth curves well-placed mash on that
front illumination that's a really nice
touch so maybe that's the right
conclusion but I'm not going to start
going easy on George now right I mean
I've been at it for this long anyway
