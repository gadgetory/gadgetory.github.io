half 922 this is a buy request unboxing
I actually had someone send a message to
NCIX Esther on Facebook or however they
sent the message I don't know but they
asked her to ask me to unbox this
particular case and have a quick look at
it so the 922 is kind of like a little
brother to the half 932 now the whole
concept behind these half cases is not
that they aren't a full case and that
they're half a case that is not the case
rather half HAF stands for high airflow
so these cases are all about gaming and
they're all about cooling so let's have
a quick look at the overall features
extreme airflow okay that was pretty
much what I just said thank you case for
backing me up here okay accommodates
demanding high-end components including
full-length graphics cards very
important for something like the fifty
nine seventy which is a TI's latest card
which is like twelve inches long just
ridiculous okay so then seven plus one
PCI Express and slots okay cuz a lot of
new big up video cards a lot of new
motherboards to have PCI Express slots
at the very bottom so if you want to
plug in a dual slot graphics card you'll
need an additional slot even though
there isn't an actual slot there on your
motherboard okay for a tool free
installation design ready for liquid
cooling radiators and hardware so let's
have a closer look at this case now oh
man is it ever staticky today I've been
zapped by my mouse I've been zapped by
my car now I've been zapped by this case
just ridiculous it's a good thing I'm
not unboxing anything fragile to uh ESD
here okay so we'll take off the UH it's
reasonably well packed you've got about
an inch of foam around the case itself
so I wouldn't expect you to get any
damage and shipping
I mean coolermaster does a very good job
of that kind of stuff so the half 922
comes with a user manual which includes
a brief outline as well as probably a
little guide on how to do busy I guide
on how to do basic stuff like open up
the case so let's have a look at it from
the front to start
okay so you can see we've got one two
three four five five and a quarter inch
base one of them has an adapter so that
you can also mount a three-and-a-half
inch floppy drive or media card reader
whatever it is that you should desire
you've got a couple front USB front
audio and front eSATA this is a feature
we're starting to see a lot more these
days now I don't actually unbox a lot of
cases so I don't have a backup procedure
for this but on the top we will find the
power and reset as well as fan LED
switches so that's kind of cool so you
can turn your fan or turn it off turn it
on your fan LED or turn it off there's
your power and hard drive indicator LEDs
okay let's get around to this side now
personally I like to see a window on a
gaming case but if we have to make a
compromise I think a loose mesh like
this is great because it allows for
airflow which a window doesn't and it
also allows you to see the cool gaming
components inside so let's get this do
to do to do to do to do let's see how
many fans can we mount here actually
looks like you can do Wow either what is
that a 160 ml fan or you know I don't
know what you can manage here wow that's
kind of cool I guess I should kind of
check the oh it's a 200 millimeter fan
meet ok so inside we will find our five
and a quarter inch drive bays which
include tool free button clicky mounting
so all you have to do is slide the drive
in click the button and it's done we
first saw this on the cosmos I believe
next we have five three and a half inch
internal bays and I love this system
these things look really flimsy but when
you actually put a drive into them you
pop out the little the little nut thing
here you screw it back in you put a
drive in it's really solid and when you
throw it back inside here it's just not
going anywhere it's really secure so
then let's have a look inside of here
accessory wise it's going to come with
probably a lot of your typical case fare
so you got a little speaker you've got a
couple little brackets oh those are for
adapting probably too yeah I'm not even
going to guess okay so you had screws
for mounting the motherboard screws for
mounting all of your drives and
that is pretty much it some zip ties
they give you some zip ties for cable
management which is pretty nice to see
and speaking of cable management we've
actually got a lot of cable management
features in here so your power supply
mounts at the bottom but then you can
route the cables directly up the back of
the motherboard tray and you can reach
around to I'm going to lean this back so
you can see inside better so you can
reach around to the eight pin up here
you can go from the back and then you
can come around to your 24 pin here on
the motherboard you can actually remove
your CPU cooler even if it has a
backplate and replace it without taking
your motherboard out of the case which
is awesome if you actually change your
CPU cooler more often than you know once
every year or whatever okay and here
we've got our seven PCI expansion ports
and this one is cool if you have like
cathodes or if you have some kind of fan
control or knob that mounts on the back
of the case you don't want to take up an
actual expansion slot you can mount like
a switch or whatever on the back of the
PCI bracket here so that's pretty cool
to see so we haven't included 200ml fan
in the bat in the top as well as support
for a dual 120 millimeter fan or
radiator as well in the top and then at
the back we've got a 120 millimeter fan
mount as well as liquid cooling holes
should you desire to do an external
radiator mount down here in the bottom
we have what appears to be a 140
millimeter fan mount and that is also
pretty cool to see you've got your usual
stuff coming from the front these cables
aren't they're not sleeves they're not
black I mean I'd like to see something
like that because like the Corsair 800 D
case is fantastic for that kind of stuff
the little aesthetic details but they're
nice and long so you can reach to
wherever it is that they need to go
let's have just one quick look around at
the back of the case okay the back of
the case looks like a case awesome and
then let's have a look at the other side
panel as well as the other side with the
panel off I just want to have a quick
look there so that I can show you a
little bit in more detail some of the
cable management features so once again
you can you've got enough space on this
side of the motherboard tray that you
can actually route fairly thick cables
without interfering with any
you've also got a lot of room to mount
cables and whatever else you need up
here on the other side of the five and a
quarter inch base this is a front led
fan it is red and it plugs in just like
this you can see it wired up to the
switch right here and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the half 922
my phone's ringing and I'm gonna have to
go now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
