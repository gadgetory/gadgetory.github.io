video called the solid-state drive
versus hard drive torture test you guys
seem to like it but also voiced that
there were some too many variables with
the old drive having all that junk on it
yeah we copied it's a new drive but
whatever today we're here to address
those concerns also don't forget to stay
subscribed - tech tips for more videos
in the future where we address your
concerns almost a year later
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilized the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click now to learn more just like last
time we'll be comparing the performance
differences of hard drives and solid
tape drives as you might have expected
but unlike last time we will be using a
fresh OS on these drives this time
around we yet again will have the older
model 1 terabyte hard drive and a nice
new fresh SSD but we also have added the
older model SSD and a newer model hard
drive to get a more well-rounded look at
this picture in the test we will be
doing clean installs on the drives
instead of using the dirty install we
had on the hard drive from last time
this isn't to say that we've changed our
mind we still like doing real-world
testing I just thought that this time
around we would use give all the drives
a new clean slate a new beginning and a
fair chance to fight for their category
this isn't a proper sanitized scientific
approach to benchmark in these drives
and we still suggest that if you're
looking for those types of results you
should check out sites like storage
review but while I have removed the
variability of junk sitting on the drive
to make the results more consistent I
still think this is a great real-world
representation of performance because we
still get to see the difference between
fresh drives and older drives who've
held together through rigorous use the
first drive we'll be looking at is the
Western Digital one terabyte drive which
is an old dog for this race
I used this drive for years and more
than a few different home servers and I
honestly beat the crap out of it
it was never really properly cooled and
was rarely screwed in properly but it's
still alive so it's got that going for
it next up we have the shiny new 6
terabyte Seagate Enterprise Drive it's
fresh out of the box and has either not
been used or been used slightly by Linus
before this test but not much though
either way it's still super fresh and
should be performing to the best of its
abilities to give a solid performance
benchmark for modern hard drives then we
get to the SSD starting with my aging
samsung 830 series SSD it has seen a lot
I use this drive for benchmarking for a
long time and I like to keep those
drives clean so natural
seen more operating installs than any
drive I've ever owned and last but not
least is the badass 850 Pro one terabyte
SSD this drive normally needs no
introduction but it has a huge capacity
for an SSD of one terabyte like I
already mentioned and it's pretty damn
fast so I don't mind having it as a
representation of really fast new SATA
SSDs now that isn't to say that it's as
fast as the nvme drives but either way
installed Windows 8.1 is our
benchmarking operating system onto the
850 Pro and after fully updating it and
installing all the necessary drivers for
our x99 platform system I installed open
office because we will be messing around
with OpenOffice just like we did in the
last video in an attempt to show a real
world representation of performance
after all that was done I just mirrored
that drive on to my other three test
drives first up was restarting and
loading up OpenOffice this is similar to
the tests we did last time where we
restarted and loaded up Firefox to the
home page but should take the drives a
little bit longer this time as
OpenOffice is definitely a heavier
program this test should be fairly
reasonable representation of how long it
would take your computer to be usable
when performing a restart next up was
timing how long it takes to uninstall
OpenOffice then after Open Office was
uninstalled timing how long it takes to
calculate the size of the C Drive both
of these tests were an attempt to
represent how long a fairly standard
task would take on each of these drives
in conclusion not that surprising
although it is impressive how much
faster the 850 Pro is compared to the
830 of course this doesn't mean hard
drives are useless mind you you may have
noticed that our hard drive is 6
freaking terabytes and they come even
larger than that if you happen to need
it that's not all either hard drives do
tend to be a lot easier to recover data
from if you have some sort of disaster
because of just how they fundamentally
work but then as you saw the SSDs are
insanely fast compared to hard drives
even May 30 the older one if you want to
learn more about the differences check
out - as fast as possible episode on it
here alright guys was this the test you
were looking for when you commented on
the last video I know I'll probably have
to redo this at some point
to some degree with nvme drives but I
think that's going to kind of be down
once they mature a little bit and once
we have more of them to try out anyways
