swiftech MCR 420 XP so this is part of
their XP series of radiators which is
their higher performance hier Finn
density versus the QP quiet power series
of radiators and this is also their
largest radiator to date so out of all
of the radiators both tech has produced
this one has the highest overall cooling
capacity so you can see this is an MCR
although I guess it'll also work for XP
oh yeah okay MCR and it'll also work for
XXX dash you know x.x series radiators
make sure the screws do not hit the
water channels this is a very good
warning you should heat it because if
you go all the way through to the water
channels you will puncture your radiator
and you will have no warranty whatsoever
for doing that because it is your own
fault all right here in this little box
we find the only real accessories that
come with a product like this and that
is mounting screws wow these are I've
been here pretty good difficult to
remove that's ok we have unboxed things
before on this channel we will unbox
things again we will not be stymied
alright so here you have these are the
correct length for going through 25
millimeter fans into the threading on
the radiator itself so you'll see here
on the rad there are threaded holes just
like that so you go through the fan into
that and you see there's quite a gap in
between the thread and the fins
themselves just make sure you don't go
all the way through into that you should
actually have enough extra thread left
over on a screw like this to even do a
fan grill but it'll be tight we've also
got a couple here for mounting the
radiator directly to the case if you do
not have a fan in between so those are
the mounting options that are included
next we've got the radiator itself so
this is a very high thin density
radiator so what does Finn density mean
basically radiators all work the same
basic way you bought fittings up at the
top okay so here you can see we've got g
one quarter threaded holes ok and then
you've got a tank two tanks
the top just like this usually there's a
little bit of a spill over between the
two tanks that decreases the overall
restriction of the radiator without
dramatically affecting the performance
so what happens is it goes in this tank
it goes down the tubes that are attached
to this tank so these tubes right here
all the way down to the bottom where
there is another tank you can see this
tank is quite small but it is attached
this tank is attached to all of the tube
so it goes down these tubes into the
reservoir tank at the bottom up these
tubes and then out the other g one
quarter fitting so what determines the
cooling performance of a radiator
basically surface area water cooling is
all about taking something like this and
cooling your CPU with it which is
something that you cannot realistically
do with an air cooling heatsink because
you can't fit this directly on your CPU
so you've got a ton of surface area
you've also got water which is an
extremely efficient way to move heat
around so you move the heat away from
your CPU which has a cpu block on it you
move it into the radiator where the idea
is you have this enormous surface area
so how does the surface area happen when
all you've got is these little tubes
well these tubes are soldered to
aluminum fins so when I say high thin
density what I mean is you see how these
fins are folded on themselves they're
just folded folded folded fold it fold
it all the way down the length of the
radiator well a loaf in density radiator
will have fewer folds so like a bigger S
shape whereas a high-density radiator or
fpi fins per inch high FBI raided
radiator will have many little folds
there's disadvantages and advantages to
each this one has more surface area
which means more cooling capacity than a
QP series radiator which has bigger s
shapes however if you're going to use
low rpm quiet fans you're actually
better off with laufen density so this
radiator is for high CFM high static
pressure fans which can blow a bunch of
air through it regardless of the
restriction that is causing by being so
dense whereas if you have low rpm fans
you're actually going to be better off
to have less restriction to the airflow
less density in order to get the most
cooling potential out of it so
particular radiator takes 4 120
millimeter fans on one side for 120
millimeter fans on the other side
although you do not have to install 8
fans on it you can do just one and
actually get this question a lot too how
do i install fans on a radiator so I
might as well answer it since I'm here
you can either install them blowing air
down through it you can install them
flip to the other way pulling air
through the radiator from the one side
and then pushing it out away from it or
you can do push-pull which is to install
8 fan so you blow away this way and suck
in this way personally my preferred way
of installing fans on a radiators to do
one bank of fan so for fans down the one
side pulling air through the radiator
and then pushing it away from it why do
I do this the reason is very simple
because i am lazy if you have fans
blowing air down into the rad so you've
screwed them in what happens is you're
going to get dust buildup all along this
surface because that's where the air is
pushing down on to the rad in order to
clean it you have to either blow
compressed air at it okay which won't
even do that great of a job because
there are fans in the way or you have to
unscrew all your fans blow it off put
the fan back on so the reason that I
always install fans sucking air through
the radiator and pushing it away is that
then all the dust accumulates on this
surface so I could just go clean it off
and I am done so this particular
radiator is available in a variety of
sizes you can get it with single 120
dual 120 triple 120 and quadruple 120
the advantages and disadvantages of each
are that the smaller the sides radiator
you go the better your case
compatibility is going to be and the
larger size radiator you go the better
your cooling performance is going to be
so there are very few cases that can
internally mouth a quadruple radiator
like this but I will be installing this
in the Silverstone TJ 11 for my ultimate
liquid-cooled machine and I hope you
