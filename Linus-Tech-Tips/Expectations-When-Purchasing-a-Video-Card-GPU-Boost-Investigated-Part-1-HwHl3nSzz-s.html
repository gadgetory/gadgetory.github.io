an nvidia GPU i will state right at the
start of the video how fast the graphics
card was in terms of core clock speed
and memory clock speed and for quite a
while now those members have really
never been correct representations of
how fast the card ran even when it
wasn't overclocked what's to blame GPU
boost
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click now to learn more
now Nvidia claims that their GPU boost
2.0 technology extracts every ounce of
computing power from compatible Nvidia
graphics cards which results in a
maximizing of frame rates in each and
every game damn and that GPU boost 2.0
is faster and more flexible than 1.0
giving users more control over its
configuration that's what Nvidia claims
so ok but what does all that actually
mean well the whole idea of GPU boost is
for it to be an overclocking assistant
what we'll be exploring today is the
effects that it has on your graphics
card when you do nothing at all but it
does change things if you happen to
tweak settings especially voltage and
thermal limit and power limit stuff like
that but that's a long story as well we
may explore that later in a future video
if you guys are interested so hit the
like button to let me know GPU boost
increases these things automatically by
detecting if an application would be
able to properly utilize additional
graphics performance then as long as you
have the additional Headroom in both
thermal output and power draw you're
going to be good to go for GPUs to kind
of do its thing attempting to increase
your various clock speeds in order to
give you the additional performance you
can use without any intervention
intervention from you now you're
probably thinking the effects of this
must be quite small and insignificant
with graphics cards being advertised all
over the place with they're based in
boost clock speeds isn't the boost clock
speed as advertised just what the GPU is
going to boost to anyways well kind of
but also totally not at all
you'd never expect a manufacturer or for
that matter a retailer to undersell
their product but what's kind of exactly
happening here is that they're doing
just that the gigabyte g1 gaming 980 TI
that I reviewed a while back you can
check the video up here
it had an advertised base clock speed
eleven hundred and ninety with an
additional advertised boost clock speed
of one hundred and one more than that
which was twelve hundred and ninety one
now why do I find this super interesting
well for a few reasons to be honest
reason one is that you'll never really
see that base clock speed anyways
essentially any game will cause GPU
boost to kick in so whatever next up is
that super specific boost clock of
twelve hundred and ninety one with a
number that's specific you'd expect it
to be exactly twelve ninety one but as
we discovered in that video it was a
massive increase of 79 megahertz to an
actual final boost clock speed of
thirteen seventy so why not advertise
thirteen seventy did they not know it
would be this fast or much more likely
than that were they making a
conservative guess and this is where our
testing began I needed a ton of the same
GPU that all had GPU 2.0 technology and
that's not exactly a cheap proposition
to make
luckily in video was already sending a
six freaking tight next cards only four
featured here they sent it our way so
that we could do system upgrades for the
editors and I took the opportunity to
both build the compensator system the
build of law the build log of which you
can see here and do my testing for GPU
boost the results were kind of awesome
to be honest each card has its average
range of core clock speeds that it would
move between the first interesting
observation here is at the lowest
fluctuation on the lowest boosting card
was still 13 megahertz faster than the
advertised boost clock speed of a Titan
X from Nvidia these are all reference
cards the second observation is that the
highest of the average fluctuations was
54 megahertz above the advertised even
with every single Titan X hitting a
thermal wall of 83 degrees under load in
conclusion I personally think that was
damn interesting but it was a little bit
disappointing that we ran into the exact
same thermal wall on every single card
due to the high heat producing Titan X
and a reference cooler we could have
increased our thermal limit but I want
to see what the
cards to do without any changes
happening to them and honestly I'm not a
huge fan of running cards that hot
anyways
so no major loss there it was also
interesting that the maximum clock speed
of eleven thirty nine was hit by four
out of the six cards for Stage two if
you guys are interested and I can get
different cards I'd like to try this
again but with better cooled cards maybe
some aftermarket coolers and stuff when
playing with some overclocking settings
would be fun as well I'd like to explore
the idea of hard-coded maximums what
settings changes produce the biggest
results automatically from GPU boost and
GPU boost overclocking versus manual
overclocking so don't forget to hit that
like button if you're interested so I
can try to acquire those additional
cards speaking of stuff and things
Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave Club is a
great way to get razors and other
various bathroom supplies shipped
directly to your door for only a few
bucks a month the razors are
high-quality and we have a ton of
community members men and women alike
who use them every day and love smooth
shave that they get no matter how thick
or coarse their facial hair may be for
some reason this comes to a shock to
many people but yes even though I have
facial hair I do shave and I would have
a pretty beastly neck beard if I did not
I definitely say that the shave I get
from Dollar Shave club's razors is
pretty damn nice on top of their razors
they also have dr. Carver's shave butter
which goes on smooth and clears you can
see what you're doing and their
peppermint scented butt wipes for men
for those of you out there in North
America who can't get to a bidet so
check out everything they have to offer
