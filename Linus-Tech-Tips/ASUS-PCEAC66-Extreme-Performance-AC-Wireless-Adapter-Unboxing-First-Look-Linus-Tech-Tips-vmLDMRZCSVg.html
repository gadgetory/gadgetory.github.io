the asus pc e - a c6 6 dual band PCIe
adapter now I have no idea what the
truck Asus is talking about when they
call it the world's fastest 5g Wi-Fi
because to my understanding 5 the GD
notation is more of a cellular sort of
wireless thing and there's nothing 5g
about it at all because this is actually
more of a gigabit sort of class of
product so whatever and then it's all
it's not even not even or not even that
ok here we're not even done making fun
of the packaging yet so this is a fast
networking solution which is an
abbreviation for fast EA SE and stable
like that's not how that's not how
abbreviations work but it's ok because
as long as the product is freaking
awesome then it's fine so ok so it can
do thirteen hundred megahertz wireless
AC 450 mega r-13 1300 1300 megabit per
second wireless AC 450 megabit per
second Wireless n that makes it at the
fastest tiers of both of those standards
for a total throughput of about 1750
megabit per second now in the real world
you're not going to observe this but
unlike one of the wireless AC solutions
we looked at recently which was a USB
based solution this one actually has the
horses to back up those specs so unlike
some you know I mean think about it this
way guys USB is USB 2 is 480 megabit per
second what were the odds it was going
to deliver 1700 megabit per second or
1300 megabit per second or whatever it
was rated for it's not going to work
this on the other hand PCI Express so it
can do up to 250 or rather 500 megabytes
per second using PCIe - okay it has the
same class of chipset because it's got
like actual power going to it has the
same class of chipset that you find in
dedicated routers and whatnot which is
why it has a beefy cooler on it and it
has a very unique antenna design that
reminds me of a Seuss's little so sorry
we had some technical difficulties with
our
mic battery for those of you who have
suggested that I use the lapel mic to
fix the audio issues I don't know if
you've noticed this but I've been using
a lapel mic for months it was actually
other issues that were causing it you
know we're not actually quite done with
the packaging yet anyway so power up to
three times the speed of current
wireless and standards yep
powerful two-way transmission gives a
hundred and fifty percent of the Wi-Fi
range of generic client cards this I
believe just based on the like uber Ness
of all of it although we'd have to try
it out to know for sure and bundled with
extensions for the detachable antennas
and I'll show you how that works in just
a moment so the AC 1750 is ultimate and
is suitable for web browsing
simultaneous downloading HD video
streaming multiplayer gaming
interference persistent 5 gigahertz
signal this is important this is more of
a characteristic of wireless AC in
general than anything else but because
it uses the 5 gigahertz band rather than
2.4 gigahertz it's not going to get the
same kind of interference from things
like Wireless phones and cordless phones
and people still have cordless phones
I'm sure someone does diesels putting
his hand up it's looks putting his hand
up either way it won't is not as
susceptible to interference from other
devices that are on those bands so
that's a good thing let me just put it
that way
although the wireless end should still
operate on 2.4 gigahertz for
compatibility so you have two options
when you install it in your PCI Express
slot you can either install the antennas
on the card directly so they'll stick
out the back of your computer like this
and you can kind of orient them in such
a way as you would like or because again
interference behind your computer can be
stronger than in other places you can
put them all on this little base station
that you can then put up somewhere
higher or you know at least have it a
couple feet closer to your oh yeah oh ok
so apparently a soos recommends mounting
it to the side of your computer even so
there's oh it has a magnetized base oh
that's cool so check this out so I could
put it on the side of our server which
would probably be a good idea right I'm
getting a look from slick because the
server hasn't been all that stable
lately but there you go so you can mount
it to that with a magnet you could just
stick it up on your desk and sort of you
know spread the antennas around like
that so it's got a nice long cord on it
it looks like about 2 feet
and then that would plug directly into
the wireless card itself so I have high
expectations for this card and will be
using it to film an episode of NCIS tech
tips so I hope that whatever I'm able to
show you is much more impressive than
that USB card and more comparable to the
wireless media bridge that we've used in
the past thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first look of the at the
PCE AC 66 from Asus what I would
consider to be the first sort of real AC
client card and oh yeah it also comes
with a low profile adapter stirrer
