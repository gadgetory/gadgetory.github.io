loading times on the 8's SD array so I'm
actually firing up crisis right now i've
just installed it just installed the
patch so this is a first boot for the
game on this machine so I'm running the
msi cyclone gtx 460 one gig I've got a 4
gigahertz core i7 875 k so that's an
overclocked processor and then I've got
four gigs of Kingston blue series hyperx
ram with tightened up timings and then
obviously I have the 80 CZ onyx series
SSD is running off an lsi raid
controller soul oh shoot I think crisis
is one of those games that takes like
three hundred years to launch the first
time so well that'll be my evidence that
this is indeed the first time I'm
launching it who runs great on core 2
duo I bet it does but it runs even
greater on better stuff here's a core
two duo right there check it out yo ok
anyway so let's go ahead and go into
options configure the game a little bit
cuz you know what's the point of playing
crysis if you're not going to play it
right so we turn up the details ah click
apply oh I better not have to reboot the
game or anything for any of this okay
yeah I want to keep this resolution
advanced that whatever gamer settings is
fine no I don't want to change anything
okay single player new game Delta star
game okay so let's see how long it takes
this is a cut screen we don't care about
this oh you got to be kidding you got to
be kidding me i can't get the cut scream
cutscene unbelievable
if someone knows what button to press
leave it in the comments they're psycho
oh hi there now he's probably invisible
or something now he's very visible now
he has a mask though I don't know how
the mask got on his face okay now he's
running really fast here's what I can't
figure out how do they run fast and jump
high because I've tried to do it several
times like you know how you do the
middle click and then you scroll to
whatever maximum ability you want to do
like I've actually tried like maximum
speed and running and then switching to
maximum strength and jumping but it
doesn't actually work or maybe I can't
get the timing down what I really wish I
could do was just end the cutscene and
then we could actually show the level
loading time okay he stomped some guy
see he did his magical thing where he
can run really fast and jump really far
and then use maximum strength again see
when are we gonna actually get a game
that comes with like like realistic
gameplay footage like I lied it'd be
kind of fun to play this game if you
were just actually like a tank like the
way he is where he's just riding on top
of a truck and he's getting pummeled but
you can't actually take that much abuse
one of my co-workers is giving me a hard
time about how I can't do that and
apparently I should enable suit
shortcuts but I don't really care
because the game was pretty easy I
didn't end up needing to do it I only
played through the first one though I
haven't actually played through warhead
so yeah I have no idea maybe a warhead
is more difficult see my SSDs aren't
worth very working very hard right now
because there's not a lot of loading to
you in fact my video card isn't working
very hard right now either because this
is running it like 640 by 480 or
whatever resolution cutscenes have been
been displayed at for the last 20 years
yay it's finally over chopper went down
I've never been that happy to see a
chopper go down okay level loading there
we go it's finally doing it the loading
is in progress so this is that that raid
array that I can see about 700 megabytes
per second sequential reads on this is
substantially faster than what I've seen
in the past although I'm not sure how
impressive it is but there you have it
crisis level loading time on an eight
SSD array like I said in the video about
the array I wasn't all that happy with
the performance of it overall I would
have liked to use some higher-end SSDs
but I don't have enough of them handy to
really make that a reality so that was
it thank you for checking out my video
on how long it takes to launch crisis
for the first time like too long and
then how long it takes to load the first
level can you shoot this guy it happens
oh you can't shoot him that's too bad
