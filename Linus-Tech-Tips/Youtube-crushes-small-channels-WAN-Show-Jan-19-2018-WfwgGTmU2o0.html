mucho for me I would have gotten you I
am so hungry right now mind you people
would have been like even more mad if we
were both eating on the show oh well I'm
gonna try to like off screen it as much
as I can I'm not even gonna show notice
how it's not even on camera
they can't even saw just randomly like
you'll be talking about nodding and then
suddenly just that is so the fringe fade
note like that is so cringe do you want
something even more cringe though hmm I
thought of a joke while I was upstairs
getting my power adapter from Oh No
Oh No what is the weapon of choice for
the most certain ninjas the shuriken oh
okay you need Oh No you're done you need
no no I'm not saying this negatively you
need a kids book I need a kid that has
like kid-friendly art there's like a
little ninja with the shuriken and you
have like the little saying like pretty
popular I'm not even kidding I think
that could be pretty good
what one of the things that like I I
would potentially do at some point is
stop at your gate and if you just
leverage your fame then a bunch of
people will buy it and you will make a
bunch of money like it just looks like
the most obvious way to cash in on like
having in turn and if a bunch of people
buy it then it'll go up in like Amazon
rankings and stuff and then other people
will buy it exactly and if it's decent
like the the shuriken joke totally good
enough and like if it goes along with
like a frame of art which is like
kid-friendly ninja dude yeah yeah and
just it's like like blown-up zoom in on
the on the shuriken and it could be like
you know what we could probably sell
even more if we build it as like a as
like a an educational tool teaching kids
about puns double entendre yeah so
explain why it works that's right
fantastic you could take Nintendo Lavos
approach and make it so that the
shuriken can be like popped out yeah we
could make it like a phonics lesson yes
you know why sure and sure so we've got
a great topic great topic yeah we've got
a great topic for you guys today and
then we've got a bunch of other about
shuriken um Apple is bringing out
apparently bringing apparently eight
billion dollars back to the US of A yeah
Samsung has begun production on the
industry's first sixteen gigabit GD dr6
memory AT&amp;amp;T is under pressure to cut all
ties with Huawei and there has been
pretty major changes to the YouTube
Partner Program and you might care or
not
actually I don't know I think a lot of
people care about this it's a funny
thing because it only really affects
content creators and yet whether it's
because there are so many indie content
creators now or whether it's the the
loyalty of fans towards these content
creators there's feel like it feels like
there
disproportionate amount of outrage over
this well because we're gonna break down
who would actually affect ya and the
impact is arguably quite small or
arguably a huge flippin deal depending
so yeah why don't we I'm excited to get
into them do you wanna start with that
do you want to start with that or should
we make them pull should we pull like a
more on this at 11:00 more on this later
for a long time and started really small
you know what let's do it second because
I want to talk about the AT&amp;amp;T thing I
was actually at the Huawei press
conference and I didn't because like the
CEO was like on stage and unhappy about
this right yeah it was it was actually
super weird yeah so so we were we were
there as as part of a sponsored deal to
share this in the chat
yeah thanks so we were there as part of
a sponsored deal this was posted
originally on the forum by Nina 360 and
the original article here is from
Android Authority so here you go
so we were there as part of a sponsored
deal now we're actually a bunch of other
influencers there as well including Zach
from jerry-rigged everything okay yeah
yeah um just trying to think who else
was there I believe Keaton from
techsmartt was there with that I'm
trying to give you a hint on someone
that I think was there no I don't think
he was okay yeah I like how that worked
though okay yeah I can't I ran into all
these guys like two to five times each
over the course of the week actually the
whole thing is a blur anyway anyway yes
was there a bunch of influencers there
which means that Huawei was spending a
bunch of money on influencers
specifically with the North American
reach and Huawei it was boasting that
they're now the number three smartphone
brand worldwide but I think someone like
you or I would look at that and unless
we've seen you know an infographic and
some kind of data to back it up we'd
kind of go really yeah
whoa like really not really actually
like not really because who else would
be bigger yeah and that's a great
question but it does take a sec there's
a little bit of pause we're like
because they don't get like I wouldn't
say that in North America in the media
in the in the kiosks in your telecom
store I wouldn't say that Huawei gets
more attention than you know someone
like an LG for example you know whose
market share is actually abysmal yeah
but over here gets treated like like a
top to your brand um so anyway he goes
on stage and he's talking about this
whole thing he's like yeah we have won
over the trust of consumers we have won
over the trust of carriers worldwide and
we have you know we you know and I think
he sort of seemed to lose his composure
like I don't follow mobile news as much
as I perhaps should other than our
topics for land show and when I'm
working on a review of a device or
whatever the case may be
yeah so I didn't our defense it's been a
little boring for a while I did not know
about any controversy or any of the
plans yeah that Huawei had made with
AT&amp;amp;T about bringing the device not just
into the US but into 18 t stores because
something to the tune of this is
according to the Android authority
article here something to the tune of
90% of smartphone sales in the US are
done on contract with a subsidy incur
this isn't the case in a lot of other
markets where people do tend to buy
their devices outright like they would
any other consumer but I'm not surprised
due to how contracts work in North
America and they don't work that way
everywhere and they don't work that way
like in North America buying a phone on
contract is actually not stupid yeah and
you know with a lot of country with some
contracts but like you know back when I
was first getting into you know cell
phone ownership when I was in like high
school I absolutely just bought on
contract you get the zero dollar phone
you get the zero dollar phone and back
then a lot of the carrier's at least one
I was on anyway so some carriers I'll
say some the one that I was on didn't
give you a discount for bringing your
own device so you were actually yeah
yeah yeah yeah if you didn't just get
hardware now you had to sign a contract
that was that was the drawback
there were what two carriers at the time
there was Rodgers and there was Telus
here soon I don't think bail was
available here yet back in back in like
2000 you're talking like sliders and
stuff right yeah I don't want to talk
about it flip no this is pretty fricking
about brick okay so I wasn't in the game
at that point
I wasn't allowed to have a phone at that
age what was the UH what was that phone
that I had it was I don't remember VBox
I got a phone pretty late okay this was
oh nice was my first phone yes oh that's
amazing so I got it because my mom's
hard of hearing and um okay so this was
I believe this was like the first like
text centric device out there yeah but
this came around at a time that bricks
were than right so she reads lips so you
wanna call her it's not really gonna
work that that's right I never even
thought about that yeah that makes sense
yeah okay cuz you've met her and you
probably didn't notice cuz she's really
good at yeah yeah but anyway so so that
was my first phone and um right so so
the only drawback was that you had to
sign a contract which didn't really
matter that much because quite frankly
where else were you gonna go if you
wanted to have a cellphone at all so as
long as I knew I knew wanted a cellphone
for two years it was no big deal and
then during your two years you would
accumulate credit towards your hardware
upgrade after a couple of years the
upgrade cycles weren't so fast like to
my knowledge Apple kind of pioneered the
new phone every year come hell or high
water upgrade cycles there wasn't that
drastic of improvements and I wasn't an
enthusiast at all yeah about phones they
placed calls and in this case they were
really good for typing text messages but
that was about it
so I was like yeah whatever who cares um
so anyway back to the whole 18t thing so
he was like visibly upset on stage when
he started talking about how you know
some carriers and some countries with
all of this work that we've put into
consumer privacy and
curity are treating us with the
appropriate respect while others are not
and like you kind of sat like you didn't
say respect I don't think but it kind of
had that tone and I was sitting here in
the audience kind of going wow this is a
really weird way to to talk about you
know your big push in the US and the
reason is that it's not happening
so while Huawei does move some phones in
the u.s. they only have access to a tiny
10% of the market because 90% of
consumers are buying on contract so it
fell through at the last minute and now
a new report has suggested that it was
US lawmakers pushing AT&amp;amp;T to cut ties
with Huawei over national security
concerns
so senators and House members are
encouraging 18t to ditch even any
potential plans to work with Huawei on
standards for its 5g network 18 DS
expected to roll out that network at the
end of 2018 and is competing with
Verizon to become the first carrier to
offer high-speed service to the US on 5g
so um Senate and House intelligence
committees sent a letter to the FCC
raising concerns over Huawei's alleged
ties to the Communist Party as well as
China's intelligence and security
services and there have been other
historical moves like this by
governments to restrict Huawei's
competitiveness so I Canada for example
really surprising I think like five
years ago was six years ago five or six
years ago Canada actually disallowed I
don't know if it's still in effect but
they disallowed the use of Huawei
telecommunications gear on the back end
of carrier networks I can totally see
why so your take on this then like you
it seems like you got an opinion here
look well okay it's the very bottom
bullet point on this and there's a lot
of information on this is Senate and
hosts intelligence committees sent a
letter to the FCC raising concerns over
hallways alleged ties to the Communist
Party as well as Chinese intelligence
and security services there's already
there's also a lot of articles online
about
Huawei's back-end equipment specifically
is specifically designed to allow the
Chinese government to tap into it also
just being owned by the Chinese
government and going up against having
ties to we're having ties to on paper
yeah there's no ownership whatsoever I
actually don't know but go ahead I
looked it up in a second ago but none of
them are sources that I'm gonna give a
hundred percent credibility to got it
that said there is ownership but again I
don't know cuz I wouldn't give a hundred
scentcredible 'ti of those sources but
anyways with the current administration
in the US and it being a to some degree
ties with Chinese government corporation
I can probably see why there might be
some influence from the government being
like no no no let's not do this yeah I
can definitely understand not wanting
the back end equipment holy crap the
phones in general I think is more of a
yeah yeah that's more just like out of I
guess out of well because okay this is
this is kind of a weird insight thing
that I'm gonna take a tangent on first
area when you travel to a lot of other
so for North Americans as we are as you
travel to a lot of other countries it's
a little weird with the purchasing
habits yeah and the stuff that you see
around because in North America you see
whatever when you go to a lot of other
countries not all other countries but a
lot of other countries you see that
country's thing yep I mean that's
particularly common in Germany Germany
is huge for it to panic
yeah Korea is huge for it yeah Samsung
everything you'd be amazed what kind of
things Samsung makes glass elevators
yeah insurance like like whoa and like
there's a there's a much more and I
might be using this word incorrectly
sorry I'm not super great on political
stuff but there's a much more
nationalistic approach to purchasing
okay where you want to purchase your own
country's things of course made in
America made in Canada are both things
yeah like we don't mind yeah like it's
kind of cool but it's not the same
particularly for Canadians I think the
the truth of the matter is that you
don't really have the option to me I
don't we don't make enough stuff like if
I wanted to if I wanted all of my
personal grooming products to be made in
Canada nope um good luck yeah like I
could probably find some stuff I'm sure
you'd be able to find especially some
beard based things no I'm sure I'd be
able to find some Canadian beard care
products not that that would be a major
concern for me since this is about as
much of a beard as I can grow but thank
you for bringing it out the only reason
why I said that is like around the world
yeah there's a lot of like a small
homebrew kind of companies that do beard
stuff because you can make your own
beard yes anyways it's yeah it's not
nearly as much of a thing in North
America but I could see how current
administration in the US might be
pushing to make it more so sir and would
be pushing against especially companies
that have ties to the governments of
other countries that are being purchased
in a nationalistic sense from coming
where there's no commitment you know
upfront to say okay yeah we're gonna
bring X number of jobs into the United
States because the potential here and
again we don't know okay so we don't
know what involvement if any of the US
government has already had in the
negotiations not sure if while we were
to come to the table with the US
government and say okay yeah like we're
committing to assembling some percentage
of our devices that we sell within the
United States in the US if they were
gonna if they were gonna come and make
some kind of a deal then I suspect it
would be more likely but right now I
guess I can't think of a great reason
for them to be gung-ho about this also
this part senators and House members are
encouraging a tea to ditch any potential
ties to work with Huawei on standards
for its 5g Network again that's them
trying to get into the backend yeah
and I'm super not surprised that that's
not max just quietly walks off stage I'm
super not surprised that that's not a
thing because of ties to the idea of
their back end being tapped by the
Chinese government so to be very clear
you know we allegedly yeah like we don't
know what is or isn't happening all we
know is what's going on we know the US
government is uncomfortable with it
we know Huawei is super unimpressed
with what's going on and presumably AT&amp;amp;T
would be as well because by most
accounts they make really good devices
it's just not necessarily affordable if
you rely on contract subsidies in order
to buy your phone and it won't be
competitive when you can walk in and buy
an iPhone for $200 yeah quote unquote
versus a huawei device for $800 because
you have to buy the whole thing up front
yeah um all right why don't we jump
right into the changes to the YouTube
Partner Program here this is posted by
heyyo on the forum the original article
is actually straight from the YouTube
blog so this is a pretty big deal do we
want to do kind of a short recap of some
of the other changes that YouTube has
made towards creators this year like
turn so what the biggest one is referred
to as the ad pocalypse and there have
actually been a couple of different
stages and yeah this I think is
considered by the community to be wave 3
okay I think I don't okay I wouldn't
entirely group III okay I saw it
referred to as that ever whatever the
community says yeah I call it - I I
could maybe bundle this in I think it's
kind of a separate thing yeah okay the
point is the ad pocalypse is sort of
used as a generic term to describe
changes that too many things Google or
through YouTube has made fundamental
changes to the way that content creators
monetize on the YouTube platform and so
some examples have been pulling
monetization from potentially touchy or
controversial subjects even if the video
in question is a mature conversation
about said controversial topic and
contains you know no you know community
guideline infringing content like if
it's you know if you're having less
you're a news a TV news organization so
that's been another you know problem
with this whole controversy is that
there seemed to be channels that are
getting their videos pulled just for
having nice in the metadata yeah
or you know like a perfect
poll was when we had the monetization
pulled from an unboxing of the razor
blade or the switchblade switchblade
interface that was the issue so because
that had that keyword in it it got the
monetization pulled so it seems like
some channels are very susceptible to
this while some mainstream channels like
I believe it's late show with Colbert
right
I believe Colbert has been pointed at as
someone who has had controversial topics
in the titles I think it's basically all
the Late Show hosts because they a lot
ok this is super generalizing but a lot
of the Late Show TV programs put
snippets and clips onto YouTube yes it's
really popular does it vary occasionally
I don't know man
but they get a lot of views yeah and
they're really heavily promoted by the
platform and they're not struck and down
in any way right ok so that's been
that's been a big part of the problem
then there was the whole issue that was
kind of tied into monetization slash
preferential treatment where Logan Paul
posted that extremely controversial
video in the suicide forest in Japan and
the perception among the community I'm
not gonna make a judgment call here
because I wasn't sitting in the war room
but I'm sure existed at YouTube when
they were trying to figure out what to
do about this yeah I wasn't present
there it was gotta be crazy meetings nor
was I present you know with Logan Paul
when he was thinking about how he was
going to react to the community's
reaction and I wasn't sitting in the
rooms of the people who are watching
those videos I'll be honest with you
guys I haven't watched it I have no
desire to see that and actually we sort
of didn't address it at all cuz my
general policy on something that I don't
agree with is to just not give it any
attention whatsoever but in the context
of our news topic today it's sort of
important because what it appeared to
spark was a conversation where the
perception was that YouTube was treating
Logan Paul vlogs that's the channel and
preferentially in not removing this
content or dealing with presumably what
would have been a fair number of
community reports and in fact at first
anyway
had appeared to not penalize the channel
or the user in any meaningful way like
many days for days not just for like a
couple hours yeah and then making
matters worse there were instances of
YouTube pulling down reuploads of the
original video because they violated
Community Guidelines while the original
was still live okay so um this blog post
is sort of about how 2017 was a tough
year in fact you know let's let's just
sort of discuss some excerpts from it
2017 was a tough year what do they got
here despite the issues more creators
than ever earning a living on YouTube
blah blah blah major focus is protecting
our creator ecosystem insuring your
revenue is more stable now we want to
prevent bad actors from harming the
inspiring and original creators we want
to do this we want to do that so
basically what they've done seemingly as
a response to these issues is they have
changed the previous eligibility
requirements for the YouTube Partner
Program which going way back so just I
do another history lesson yes okay I
think it's important yeah so when I
first started out on YouTube it was
either I think it might have been pre
monetization I think I was pre
monetization I'm not sure so when I
started out on YouTube it was either pre
monetization at all or it was shortly
after the partner program had been
introduced and the only way to get into
the partner program was by specifically
being invited so really early guys like
Phil DeFranco work in it well before I
had access to it yeah
after that there was an application
process that was when I got in through
the NCIX tech tips channel and not sure
if Linus tech tips existed yet although
I actually I think it did so that was
when I got in actually no I'm actually
quite certain that it did because there
was already revenue to show for the
YouTube program back at NCI X when Linus
tech tips was created because I
member negotiating a bonus around it or
something okay okay then YouTube
basically opened up the floodgates and
they went okay we're just gonna put
monetization on all the things because
we've got this inventory of videos and
anywhere there's eyeballs Google wants
to put an at yeah
that's their mo Tao works so anyway
fast-forward quite a bit in April 2017
they set an eligibility requirement of
ten thousand lifetime views the idea was
to have some kind of a history to look
back at for a given channel to make sure
that it wasn't just blatant reuploads of
copyright TV shows for example which is
still all over the platform oh yeah
and lots of other issues like music and
movies and whatever else yeah but but
the idea was so that they could they'd
have at least you know 10,000 views
worth of time to weed out the ones that
were just blatantly not real content and
then here's the follow up that threshold
provided more information to determine
whether a channel followed our community
guidelines but it's been clear over the
last few months that we need a higher
standard so starting on the 16th of
January which three days ago and this
the blog says starting today like they
effective there's a little I grow in
that in that regard
yeah they changed the eligibility
requirements for monetization to 4,000
hours of watch time in the past 12
months and 1000 subscribers so basically
it appears as though if you're a
one-hit-wonder
who doesn't have any subscribers you
might not be able to monetize and if you
you know run your channel as kind of
like a hobby and you don't actually get
a ton of views or a ton of hours of
watch time but you actually have a
decent number of subscribers who wait
for your videos that you may be
published very infrequently you could be
affected by YouTube's attempt to crack
down on potentially inappropriate videos
from monetizing now right off the bat
I'm not actually working off of my notes
here but right off the bat I can
identify a couple of problems here
number one is that that whole spider-man
Elsa
thing was going on for over a year
yeah for a frickin long time and these
requirements would have done absolutely
nothing just a lot of thing I got way
more hours and way more subscribers than
that the issue with the suicide forest
vlog wouldn't stop that wouldn't have
stopped that what I'm trying to figure
out right now is what this move has to
do I think this the community's upset
about oh no I think this has a lot to do
with stopping things that the community
is not particularly upset about but
YouTube and advertisers might be upset
about yeah I think it will directly help
stop things like people monetizing movie
song episode all those kind of uploads
because a lot of those accounts will get
banned but we'll get payouts and we'll
get payouts based on content that they
ripped from someone else and they might
just create a new account and then get
paid out on that account create a new
account get paid on that account so I
think they're trying to hammer down on
that I don't think it's really going to
solve much else another thing that I
want to throw into the ring that some
people have brought up is if you have a
thousand subscribers if you have less
than a thousand subscribers and less
than four thousand hours of total watch
time over the last twelve months yeah
how much were you making so okay this is
where piece into the conversation that
goes is this a big deal yeah so it is a
big deal in the sense that YouTube is
kind of spinning it as a benefit to the
community when actually this has as far
as I can tell everything to do with the
blowback that they're getting from
advertisers for having that wide open
we're gonna put monetization on
everything then advertisers realizing
and all yeah Brad was getting acai I
forgot that part of the history lesson
unfortunately yeah so advertisers
realizing that their brand was getting
placed next to content that they found
objectionable like like literally
terrorists which we've talked about
which we've talked about before and I
think this is just follow up on that and
I think that the suicide forest incident
has nothing
remember no no it does it does but not
on the community side yeah what it has
to do with is that he was a preferred
channel yeah a channel that YouTube
specifically goes out there and pitches
to advertisers like we're a preferred
channel preferred channels are to an
even greater degree I would think
expected to abide by the Community
Guidelines which by the way doesn't
necessarily mean that you can't drop a
you know shit bomb in your video
occasionally it spelled out pretty
clearly I mean you know egregious
profanity I believe is covered in the
Community Guidelines I'm not sure I
haven't looked egregious is kind of a
specific terms a very sort of great
actually but they're there so there are
things well no it makes it so that
probably what you just said isn't gonna
get you know owned you'd have to like go
pretty hand so it's still great but
you'd have to but I don't know how
they'd make it less gray you know what I
mean so here's the Community Guidelines
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
nudity or sexual content harmful or
dangerous unten violent or graphic
content hateful content harassment and
cyber bullying threats span misleading
metadata and scams copyright Privacy
impersonation child endangerment and
additional policies a big issue about
all this is like I can even think off
the top of my head of one or more
examples that I've seen of at least
every single thing in there yeah so
vulgar language is actually bundled
under additional policies right here and
it specifically says here that sexually
explicit language or excessive swearing
in your video or associated metadata may
lead to your video being age restricted
so excessive so what happened here was
and in this case I don't even think
there's really anything in here you
could call a graphic content actually
violent or gory content that's primarily
intended to be shocking sensational or
disrespectful okay it's definitely it's
exactly what um so anyway the problem
here is that as far as I can tell
YouTube's got yet another round of
blowback from advertisers for
specifically promoting a channel that
blatantly violated their community
guidelines and then the content was just
left there presumably with ads still
running and I think if it was dropped
superfast it might have been a different
reaction from the advertisers yes and
from the community yeah
but ultimately that's what's going on
here the collateral damage is mostly
channels that and YouTube lays this out
in their blog post mostly channels that
made less than 2 dollars and 50 cents
last month ok this is what I was saying
and less than a hundred dollars in the
last year if you're relying on that whoa
yeah there is probably other ways that
you can make money on the internet
easier pretty sure there are and or even
Weebly mode bonds and I mean move on
we're profitable
we sold berries that wasn't profitable
yeah yeah anyway the point is that you
could just go work at the place that
there's a lot of outrage about this and
I'm putting myself I won't bundle you in
with me but I know I'm here myself in a
position on it to say something kind of
unpopular yeah but I actually don't
think this is that big of a deal I'm
with you cuz ok the first thing I did
when I read this was like at the very
beginning before you get really deep
into it I was like wow they're screwing
over the little guy why would they do
that that makes no sense and then I saw
their thresholds and I was like yeah
this isn't gonna make a difference to
anyone's major bottom line so anyone
that small speaking one bertie youtuber
yeah I would recommend you turn off here
I was just gonna say you will get more
traction with people and they will share
it more and they'll watch more of the
video if you turn off the ads anyways
and you'll be seen as a good guy and
more people will watch your stuff
because you got to understand that
there's always a trade-off between
monetization and we'll get into our
sponsors for the moment back to you
there's always a trade-off between
monetization of your existing audience
yeah and audience building we could
upload videos every day that are pure
ads and our audience would stop growing
or we could dial back all of our ads
entirely and sponsors and all that stuff
turn off everything and we could grow
faster and every creator out there is
trying to find that happy medium where
they are satisfied with their level of
growth and when you're
can get good money when you're making 2
bucks a month off YouTube you need to
focus on growth it's probably worth
focusing on growth especially because at
that point in time growth is way harder
to get with all of that said I'm coming
at this from sort of a maybe not unique
but sort of an unusual angle in that the
ad pocalypse has not had a significant
negative impact on our Adsense yeah and
this is something that you know I was I
was gonna address at some point but at
the end of the day you don't get up what
it's called a fill rate so the number of
impressions that you serve versus the
number of ads accompanying those
impressions if you had one ad on every
video that you showed to someone
antvenom just said same Oh interesting
yeah um so so if you had one ad in front
of every single video view that you
showed someone say it's the perfect
world where nobody has adblock and
YouTube's ad sales is like going
gangbusters they can sell more ads than
YouTube can serve views which is like
really yeah yeah ok that would be a 100%
filler rate now if YouTube's ad sales
you know program completely shut down
and there were no ads that would be a 0%
fill rate nobody has a 100% fill rate so
what it means for family-friendly
content or non-controversial content is
that your fill rate and your CPMs
because you might get access to the more
premium ads as a YouTube preferred
partner for example your fill rate might
go up and your CPMs which is the amount
that you get paid per thousand views or
per thousand ad views that can go up to
so our January this year our viewership
will not be higher than it was last year
but through a combination of YouTube red
being more popular and through the ad
pocalypse stripping advertising away
from many many many many many
potentially hundreds hundreds of
thousands of very very very small
channels that will contribute to a
higher fill rate and potentially
CPM for us we are actually going to make
more in Adsense this January than we did
last January which is good because we
have like five more people than we had
last January oh that's that's not anyone
else's problem it's just if you guys
were concerned that a lot of people do
express concern it the way that we hire
and the way that we like build sets and
buy cameras and all those things
possible doing business you got it you
got to do things we are we are don't
worry we are we're planning for the
future we're watching all of these
trends these are things that even though
we don't necessarily talk about all the
time we are we have eagle eyes on if
you're on something you tube and you're
not moving you're screwed you gotta do
some stuff sometimes and that's it
that's another thing I want to jump back
to for the like if you are if you are a
smaller creator and I'm using the
terminology of below a thousand subs and
below four thousand watch hours in the
last what is it twelve months I think
it's the last twelve months yeah but you
can't now but don't monetize and you
might not want to monetize for a little
while you might eventually get brought
into the partner program and you might
want to stay not monetize and then when
you get there you will get the benefit
of YouTube not paying out a bunch of
tiny amounts to a bunch of creators that
might never even reach the threshold but
they're gonna get a check effectively
giving YouTube 100% of the add payout so
this may happen
wow that's interesting this may actually
hurt YouTube's bottom line if they are
only feeding ads to people who are
actually gonna get right now is way more
worried about making advertisers happier
yes get more big big bins oh I know but
this just I think in the extremely short
run it might hurt it yeah I think this
is a more longer-term play but yeah I I
would focus and maybe if you're like I
need to focus on this YouTube thing more
I need to cut back hours at work that's
when you monetize your videos yeah and
you just tell your audience that hey
guys I'm gonna monetize my videos
because I want to focus more time on
making the great content that you guys
enjoy of basket weaving with RGB lights
and I'm gonna I'm gonna keep doing it
I'm gonna go hard I'm gonna spend at
least four hours
weaving these lights together making
sure all the power strips are going all
properly and you know you can have
glowing fruit bowls yeah I don't know
just communicate that to your audience
and that will serve you a lot better
doing it later on down the line once you
have an established core audience
because then they won't leave they'll
keep sharing it because they're an
established core audience and you can
actually survive okay question for you
this was a great question I forget who
asked it would you allow Logan Paul on
floatplane would you I don't know you're
the lead of partner management whatever
it's true I am but I'm curious to know
what you think knowing what you know
let's say that let's say that he goes
you know what let's say he didn't post
an apology that was super sincere let's
say that he was just like you know what
no I'm gonna film dead bodies whenever I
come across them don't worry about it um
your your the public front okay well you
know what I have an opinion I'll throw
my pain I want to cheat and hear what
you have to say no no no no you all
yardie yeah you gave away your hand
what no with your opinion nope you said
you have one you have to do it um I
don't really care okay because in my
opinion how this should all be handled
and how I think things in general should
all be handled is I don't personally in
my personal morality whatever like the
idea of the governmental hand coming
down and slapping okay I would prefer
that he joins the platform yep people
saw that video and everyone unsubscribed
and everyone stopped giving us money and
stopped giving him money
here's the here's the leader of partner
management answer the answer is
absolutely yes he would be allowed on
the platform because here's the thing
about the YouTube community guidelines
so floatplanes guidelines are basically
along the lines of legality yeah and
there's nothing illegal about walking in
that forest and filming something well
you're not a lot of going off trail I
don't think it's illegal I think it's
just there's lots of signs advising you
not to
yeah so so as far as I can tell she
didn't actually do anything illegal
because that's that's one thing you guys
have to understand is we're running
sorry I'm gonna interject for a moment
when running floatplane that's one of
the reasons why it's its own company yes
is because our opinions and linus media
group's opinions don't matter we're
running the platform i think it's gross
i don't like it either not cool with it
easily but that is not my call to make
and if floatplanes if floatplanes
objective is to be the the not evil
overlord then ultimately we have to
allow okay because flow plan itself is
not going to be a broader community in
the same sense that YouTube is current
flow plain will be individual creators
with their own communities and if his
community is fine with it which
fascinating they seemed to be they
seemed to be it wasn't until this went
viral and kind of spread beyond his
subscribers that people started sitting
up and taking notice of how effed up it
was
and if his community is cool with it
then ultimately we can just not watch it
not look at it and kind of hope for the
best and like one thing about floatplane
if you're subscribed to this dude and
you're like wow I really don't like that
I don't respect him anymore I really
dislike this content and you don't want
to see it in your feet anymore
stop actively giving that person money
and it won't show up in your feet
anymore
ever that was good
hell yeah because that's how the
platform is done it's we we aren't gonna
make folk I'm going to actively pursue
people coming on the platform and I have
that I like and that I respect because I
want them to be on the platform people
we're asking if we would advertise it
it's great questions so floodplain is
not designed with a suggested algorithm
in fact we do not intend to implement
one users would have to opt in they
would have to browse creators in order
to get suggestions from us there won't
be like a you finish watching
a tech quickie video and then it's like
hey you might also like tech deals
here's a here's a sample of tech deals
go subscribe to tech deals totally
arbitrary example we haven't talked to
anyway so there's no mechanism for that
so no we wouldn't we wouldn't have to
advertise it and honestly if I was in
charge of that judgment call which I'm
pretty sure I am
I wouldn't yeah yeah and there's there's
yeah anyways so essentially yeah buddy
our opinions don't say he's a he funny
enough tech deals is a real channel I
didn't know that whoa what
holy huh it's like you are referencing
something really specific but without
even knowing both dad oh darn um okay
anyway okay you know what okay do you
have anything else to add here um no
essentially our our opinions won't
govern what ends up being on fo p yeah
hopefully our opinions will drive
certain people to join yeah like hey we
like you will you join we want to
support doing great stuff but eventually
the doors gonna be somewhat open to
creators our joint if they want and yeah

honest answers
another honest answers on maybe how
Adsense is going right now because
everyone has been talking about it I
don't know it's as interesting yeah I
don't know if it's like it's not as
punchy as some of the other honest
answers yeah and I kind of have another
one planned about sort of how we handle
sponsored content because I think
there's been a lot of misunderstandings
that people have had so we've had people
get upset about a sponsored review and I
kind of look at it and I go well this
didn't say review anywhere in it
it wasn't structured like a review and
we said right up front by the way this
is sponsored which you should assume
whether it's called a review or not that
anything sponsored is not a review I'm
sorry that was something talked about in
my opinion in in yeah I think that's the
next episode of honest answers that I
have planned dude well how do we handle
sponsor relationships because we have a
lot of sponsors Intel AMD Nvidia Asus
like the list MSI the list goes on Razer
the list goes on and on and on of
companies that we've worked with

alright so what else we got here
oh man now we're bad one plus news gotta
be kidding me
um okay so posted by Wulfgar on the
forum 1 plus head appears to be a credit
card breach update January 19th update
number 2 thank you for your comments
we're reading each and every one and we
appreciate your feedback we do want to
clarify only potentially affected users
will receive the email but in a nutshell
oneplus has emailed nearly 40,000 of
their customers to inform them that
their credit card data may have been
compromised here's what I want to know
like we've discussed this because
bacliff Linus tech tips
other than subscriptions on the forum
there was no reason for us to ever need
people's payment information one of the
rules hold on even then we didn't hold
it one of the reasons that we opted for
PayPal was that it allowed us to take
payments in a recurring fashion without
holding the customers payment
information ourselves we don't want that
responsibility and we need it we got
owned once did me like I remember a long
time ago that thing yeah and like that
was Kate and there was no payment
information and there was no full-time
developers on the site stuff which is
part of the reason why we got owned but
there was no payment information they
didn't get anything yes we got nothing
so I'm looking at this going like ok so
right we've discussed it with floatplane
we found other solutions but still on
floatplane we will hold no I don't want
it payment information don't want any of
it that liability that's horrible
horrible because then we might have to
send out this email then then I don't
even the level 1 tax podcast might be
talking about floatplane media and their
breach of a hundred thousand customers I
want them to target open media but not
our customer credit card yeah no other
things that's terrible um why do they
want this why are they keeping it
because who buys from oneplus in a
recurring fashion like are we talking
the world's most forgetful people who
lose their their - charger all the time
and they just have like a like a you
know uh that's oh wow a - button
and they just have like a like a 1 plus
equivalent of a - button to get a new -
why haven't they bought this who's still
a thing I haven't heard about - yeah I
don't know if they work in Canada though
so one of their servers was infected
with a malicious script affecting the
payment page code collecting credit card
info while was being injured ok so that
whole Ram was over nothing because it
was well as being entered it operated
intermittently capturing and sending
data directly from the user's browser
and it has since been eliminated so
anyone who entered their credit card on
one Plusnet wow that whole rant I wish
we could cut it out between mid November
2017 and January 11th 2018 could be
effective credit card info including
card numbers expiry dates and security
codes entered like what is the point of
that security code anymore when pretty
much everyone online makes you enter it
the thing about this is like you know
that from from having worked at a
retailer we don't need it to process it
costs more to process without it yeah
yeah baby interesting huh that's why
every single person takes it so that's
why everyone takes it even though the
whole point of that is supposed to be
that it's like a second factor proving
that you have physical access to the
card Oh
anyone who paid via a saved credit card
should not be affected ok so that's what
you get for saving their credit card on
websites don't do that and users who
paid via the credit card via PayPal
method those won't be affected because
their credit card is abstract appel no
no they're saying users who paid via a
safe credit card should not be should
not be affect oh wait oh right because
it's only when you enter not enter you
ok ok why do we even well you know what
why don't we even do news we should just
banter forget it yeah so they're working
with payment providers to implement a
more secure credit card payment method
and they're offering one year of credit
monitoring for those affected that's
nice cuz that's not cheap like I have I
have had to deal with credit card theft
before and - very recently yeah fucked a
lot it's like a big bummer
and then all you counsel you have Auto
subscribing or like everything is
cancelled

Nintendo announces cardboard yes
which controllers wait what no atlatl
force which it's not switch controllers
they'll get yourself cardboard kits can
pass sorry excuse me cardboard kits
compatible with Nintendo switch so okay
sorta not a great title a lot of people
in my opinion have been misrepresenting
this you get a game you get software on
the switch and then you get a cardboard
kit to build something that goes along
with that game so that you have
interesting types of physical
interaction with the game you get a game
ok everyone's like oh they're just
selling cardboard no ok so here's an
example you could make a functioning 13
key piano cradle yeah for the switch
caught you make a functioning 13 P piano
the cradles to switch console and the
right Drakon controller the ir motion
camera and the joy con detects which
keys are pressed and plays each note
through the console speakers and there's
other stuff you can take control of your
very own motorbike by constructing a
functioning set of handlebars with a joy
khan inserted in each side and the
switch console in the middle so just a
caveat here too you might not be into it
and that might be super fair but so many
people are just like oh they're just
selling cardboard no there's games that
go with I misunderstood I thought it was
a controller in the sense that there was
cardboard and stuff but you just use
your joy Khan and the switch as the
stuff got it yeah okay sure why not I
mean I confess I went out there and I
bought one of those one of those
steering wheels for the week you should
check out what's the worst you should
check out these yeah you should check
out the robot one the robot suit there's
a video for this that's like really good
actually
let's pull that out I'm sure we're gonna
end up with a strike you're just oh do
you not want to watch it no no it's fine
let's just let's just do it um you could
just YouTube Nintendo lab oh there it is
okay pull this let's pull this baby up
let's at least mute it for our best
chance here yeah so this beginning bit
is them just print it's a little bit
further so there's a fishing reel there
there's the piano yeah there's a house
thing I don't know what that does yeah
there's oh it just like vibrates and
runs around those little toys
that's the motorcycle thing this is a
fishing rod I believe this one's
available now I'm not sure I'm not sure
so yeah you actually have to like reel
in and like fight with the fish I don't
know I don't understand what the house
does I never understood that part
lagging where's the where's the robot
one though because it's crazy it's
before this it's somewhere around here
this is it okay well I think you
slightly past it okay it's cool all
right
here's a guy there's part of the
backpack thing yeah you want to see when
she takes her thing off the back so yeah
hold up shotgun yeah there okay oh but
you don't get to see the construction
Burt wait if she takes off the back and
it shows you how it works no no no just
wait cool so he has a joy con on each of
his ankles and he has a joy con in each
of his hands and they're connected by
strings through that box on the back and
those switches go up and down so it
knows he's moving right and his movement
in real life goes into the game it has
four points of it's actually kind of
cool it's kind of cool you know they're
all hopefully games
hopefully VR gets better and cheaper
enough that we can just do it that way
pretty soon yeah but I guess this is a
so that's one of the criticisms that I
think is relatively valid is it shows
the two kits there at the end yeah
they're like 69 and $79
so seventy and eighty dollars yeah and I
believe the games that are going to come
with it
are gonna be
mini-game e right whereas they could
have done a lot more with it but then we
also don't know what the games are like
sure so there could be more to it I
suspect the piano one is just gonna be a
piano that you can key into I don't
think there's gonna be like many like a
lot of minigames with it's tough but
we'll see
so last topic we had we had a lot of
people really upset with us about one of
the videos we posted at CES we said
there was an undisclosed number of
course in a laptop why do we get fucking
it we got flack for that because people
were like well here there was there was
a comment that I have where did I see it
I like just saw it going in the chat
maybe I'm in $70 for cardboard um anyway
someone was really upset they're like if
it's to embargo to say how many of them
you just shouldn't post it and I'm like
what do you not get excited about like
cool unreleased tech um anyway in
unrelated news there's a rumor on chip
he'll calm then Intel will be bringing
six core processors to mobile six core
12 thread processors word on the street
is that we're gonna see an i-5 80 308
all the way to 80 850 H and that would
be a two point six base 4.3 boost oh
wait sorry this isn't oh this is wow
this is really unclear apparently there
may also be at what an i-9 HK what that
does flop 24.8 boost six core 12 threads
sake wow that sounds awesome
all right cool so this is coffee lake H
that was it
not that I saw anything you know
unrelated news did we talk about the
Apple thing I don't think so um okay at
the very top I remember and Dan the
Samsung yeah there's kind of boring
faster memory and Apple's bringing some
money back over to the states because
the state seems like new laws on taxes
and they were like okay Holly oh-ee
Laporte's company is suing Twitter oh
because I apparently they reached an
agreement back in like 2009 because look
Leo Laporte was concerned that Twitter
was going to start serving audio-visual
content and that they're that they're
their trademarks were too similar and
that twit was audio-visual so he was
like well you know we can coexist as
long as you guys don't serve
audio-visual content but then now
Twitter serves video
so he's suing Twitter so that's
interesting I I really do wonder where
that lawsuit goes because isn't it an
acronym for this week in tech but it
doesn't matter because the trademark
twit is theirs so yeah I mean I don't I
don't personally think that most people
even know what twit is but I mean if
you're on I believe Air Canada flights
and you go to the podcast section Wow I
believe there is a Leo Laporte thing
about something the savagery is real
yeah um and on that note um thank you
for watching we will see you guys again
next week
same bat-time same bat-channel he does
have a fair point though like they did
agree not to do it and they are doing it
so I don't know where this especially if
there's an agreement between yeah I
don't know where this is going man he
probably has a lot of clothes but then
Twitter might just have enough money to
just be like no go away or maybe they
don't I don't know depends yeah they
don't make money so it depends if
someone will give them money to give to
yeah by but it's yeah I think because he
has an agreement
he's gonna get something I think it's
kind of ludicrous but that's the thing
at all but he hasn't agreed always looks
like I'm having a really bad
I like the winch Oh
Oh like mvgame suit yeah I mean one of
our topics it's it's related to that
thing that I brought up the last time
yeah but now and II know like actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
