mobile cooler master - USA dot welcome
to my unboxing of the otterbox armor
series the toughest case ever built so
it's available for a number of different
phones of which the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
one of them
the iPhone 4 is one of them so I asked
for the iPhone 4 case because I don't
have an s3 so there it is it's a little
bit on the scuffed up side my iPhone at
this point it's been in use for almost
three years so I mean this is more like
the kind of thing I would buy for a new
phone but anyway here it is now this is
a press kit so so basically don't expect
yours to necessarily come packaged
exactly like this but it's waterproof
drop proof dust proof and crush proof
the watertight latches here on the side
use a patented o-ring technology port
covers and mesh coverings tolerate
submergence for 30 minutes and up to 6.6
feet of water so there's the water proof
these guys the membranes and meshes that
that are able to sustain waterproofness
for a pretty long period of time their
non permeable membranes and protective
mesh layer keep harmful elements out
while allowing only sound to pass
through so your speakers will still work
because of the membranes but the water
won't be able to get in and see there's
an o-ring for the port to plug into
charge high-strength reinforced plastic
withstands crushing force of up to two
tons so presumably I can stand on it no
problem and it's not gonna have any
issues so there we go we already figured
that up corrosion resistant metal
latches lock the two halves of the case
together built-in screen protector
prevents scratches and damage to the
glass display and so we are actually
going to go ahead and put my iPhone 4 in
here because I am going to be starting
my Android I switched so this is the HTC
One very very shortly here and I think
I'm pretty much done with my iPhone 4
based on some toying around that I've
done with the HTC One so far so let's
have a close look at the case on the
bottom you can see there's a grill there
and a membrane there then the o-ring
seal here you can also actually see the
o-ring here because this isn't totally
sealed I had this out of the box already
so I can check it out but that's how all
of that
seals so you go you put that right there
on the side here we've got the two
corrosion resistant metal hinges the
back here is a reinforced plastic with a
spot for the flash as well as the camera
on the top you've got your lock button
quite stiff actually as well as your
headphone there we go headphone jack
right there which is again got a
membrane seal by the look of things and
an o-ring seal around the outside so you
can plug your headphones in without
worrying about that there's your mute or
your orientation lock depending how you
have that configured and there's your
volume up and down all these are quite
stiff but what I'm expecting is once I
actually get a phone in here things will
change a little bit so peel those back
just like that oh okay I don't have very
strong nails so that's a little bit
tough but there we go
and let's see how she actually opens up
I've never used an otter box before I've
never really done the whole cellphone
case thing because I don't really drop
my cellphone but inside we find a super
super grippy layer here so that's gonna
allow you to put the phone down on it
and have it not move while you're while
you're actually installing the rest of
the case so that's good it's also very
cushiony so it's got some thickness to
it so you can hear will do hahaha we'll
do an iPhone comparison there you go so
you can see how thick the actual backing
layer is here there's that o-ring that
seals up the whole case and here we go
so these pieces here latch into these
notches here you can see the way that
all of these buttons pass through so
it's actually rubber that is sealed on
to the case itself and then the tactile
feedback that you're gonna get is
probably gonna be from the buttons
themselves so that's the other than that
these are just these are just rubber
here so the cushioning around the
outside of the case is provided by this
is a bit of a harder plastic than what
we found here which is more cushiony so
because they've only got so much
thickness that they can put around it
but I'll go ahead and do an iPhone
thickness comparison there so that's
quite thick so they've got one two three
layers that are between your phone and
any kind of accidental damage you can
see they've built up the corners a fair
bit more than the actual straightaways
here and that's understandable because
that's where there's the most risk of
damage
whole buttons right here see I don't
think I ever showed that before and then
the the plastic cover is here so let's
go ahead and install it show you guys
how simple this is this is probably the
way I would actually install it as
opposed to going the other way which is
what I suggested the first time just go
ahead and slide that on so this turns
the iPhone 4 which is normally other
than its weight pretty sleek and elegant
into a bit of a brick so there's that
hold on I don't know if I did this quite
right ok so I want to make sure that I'm
getting I'm getting the right seal
because there's a pond here I'm planning
to throw the phone into it so I'm really
really hoping that I get this on right
before before I proceed with that so
yeah there we go so once you get the
o-ring into place it's just a matter of
bringing the latches up like this and
then latching it on just like that so
I'm not real confident about that I'm
gonna play around with this a little bit
off camera we'll be back in a moment all
right so it's just a matter of squeezing
it pretty good and then getting the
latches on there so now it's feeling
pretty sturdy so I guess I'll switch
over to what's gonna become my new
trademark HTC One comparison so that's
what an otterbox phone looks like
compared to an otterbox phone it's not
the kind of thing that I would use
unless I had a reason to keep my phone
super protected with all that said if
you put it in your pocket it's actually
not gonna look that much different than
your wallet in your pocket and you know
it's not like you can't get it out of
your pocket and if you keep it in a
purse this is a perfect thing to put on
your phone because you got your keys and
all your other stuff in there I mean
just in case you drop it then you know
that you're gonna have the confidence
that it's gonna be okay so there's
rubber bumpers here hard plastic here
there's quite a recessed area between
the actual SKU so you'd have to drop it
on something fairly textured to actually
manage to impact the screen so let's uh
let's see what we can do to this baby
all right
so how about that tree you think I can
hit that tree now watch this Drive Oh
run all the way through to the other
side okay just second ah I missed the
treat oh I hope I can find the phone
what oh yeah right my mics on okay so
hold on it bounced it all the way
through
to the street here so I'm just gonna
retrieve it and okay it looks like we
did a little bit of damage oh you think
you think I can hit the light post or
the light at the top let's try it
Wow Oh wrong woody whoa okay that might
have been it for it oh there you go
folks I don't think I recommend that
let's see how the phone did oh wow check
this out don't come come come so that
was probably a good 20 feet up so the
OtterBox opened it did not actually stay
closed so I guess if I was to find a
design improvement that they can make it
would be the plastic latches here
because you can see the metal ones held
up just fine with that in mind the
diesels texting apparently we have to go
meet him now with that in mind the phone
has a scuff here see right there there's
a scuff that wasn't there before
a couple scuffs here the phone survived
the screen did not scratch so okay let's
go ahead and check it in the water I'm
gonna put it back in we'll be back in a
moment
alright so we've just reassembled it
from the fall so there's some crack
pieces there so we're gonna see if the
waterproofness held up from the 20-foot
fall so to be clear guys this is
designed for people not designed for
people who are trying to intentionally
wreck the phone and the fact that the
phone survived at all being dropped out
of what is essentially a second-story
window should be pretty impressive so
I'm gonna throw it into the water and
try and hit that brick ready guys there
we go and it's down there now
slick do you think you can reach that
this may actually be a problem okay hold
on we're not gonna leave it in there for
30 minutes one way or another just
because we already know that the
integrity of the OtterBox was
compromised by the fall oh it's good oh
it's cold
okay I got it okay
so we checked it at a brick under the
water so let's go ahead and oh it's
dirty oh okay
so let's go ahead and open her back up
and see if she leaked I mean
realistically if they're rating it for
30 minutes no no there we go look at
that there's just drips through from me
opening it but the actual hold on oh oh
okay
yeah she ain't waterproof anymore
nevermind so we knew this was we sort of
knew this was gonna happen
let's see if the phone survived was down
there for probably a good 30 seconds
anyway Oh phones on
okay so there's Diesel's message that we
haven't gone and met up with him yet so
yeah we're gonna we're gonna put it back
in the OtterBox and we're gonna kick it
all the way back to where we're meeting
with diesel and see if the phone
continues to survive what's just luck
with that
you
okay and let's pick up here alright guys
so let's see how our impact torture test
how the OtterBox held up so once again
the metal side is outstanding you can
see that spacing between the actual
screen itself and the front bezel here
paying off and you can see these metal
pieces actually contribute to the scrape
proof Ness of the device overall my only
thing is I wish that they put at least
one on the other side or something like
that you can see this guy opened up
during the impact but that's kind of to
be expected that's for waterproofness
not for impact
but these plastic ones did let go again
however you guys saw what we did to it
that is not normal use and I think what
we're going to discover at least I hope
what we're gonna discover is that the
phone did survive and that to me is the
point of one of these cases not here you
can see how I beat up this got on the
way over here the point of these cases
is not whether the case looks beautiful
after some abuse but whether the phone
inside actually still works
there's diesels message and alright just
like that there's the phone itself which
is actually not really any worse for the
wear and I give the OtterBox armor
series a pass thank you for checking out
