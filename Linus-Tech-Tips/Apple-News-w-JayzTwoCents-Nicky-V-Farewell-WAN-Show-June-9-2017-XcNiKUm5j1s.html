show with our special guest Jay's 2006
special very serious very special guest
the specialist guest the greatest you
know what's actually kind of funny is it
didn't occur to me until we were already
live but it is possible that we still
have the lower third from nope we do not
somebody goes out that folder that would
have been super cool if we still had
like an ancient lower third from having
you on as a guest like two years ago
three years ago it was probably more
like three you know probably more like
three so let's say let's do a quick
rundown of some of the topics that we
want to discuss today actually I've got
one that I'm not sure if is in the doc
but Jay you and I both released videos
discussing the X $2.99 platform and sort
of gave some thoughts on it you know I'd
love to kind of go head to head about it
and kind of go excusing some of those
thoughts and say the audience would love
for us to flesh things out a little bit
so I'm all about fleshing out if you
know what I mean
and see how much awkward silence I get I
got a good two heartbeats there yeah um
and we've also got a lot of Apple music
that I'm sure everyone is going to have
an opinion on because some of it looks
amazing and some of it looks like it
should be amazing but actually wait is
this seriously not not in here in detail
okay that's fine we can we can get to
that later so yeah without further ado
let's roll the intro and get right into
this because there's a lot to cover
today yeah dude I can hear it oh right
from singing
once is for the show with savage turkey
press box and cable ma okay so why don't
we jump right into the big highlight
from the I didn't put the guest up there
is why don't we jump into the big
highlight from Apple's event oh and I
just realized we don't have J when I'm
sharing my screen so we're just going to
have to do the screen shares really
quickly so this is from the verge the
eight biggest announcements from Apple
WWDC 2017 number one Apple announces the
home pod speaka to take on Amazon echo
and so no so can I kick this off by
saying who here actually uses and/or
desires my grandpa all the time same
with my mom okay so tell me exactly what
it is that people are using I almost
have no speakers for but I think part of
the idea is that it's it can be louder
than your phone automatically without
having your volume settings already on I
think it's more responsive to voice from
further away I'm assuming those things
are what it's for I don't use it J but
yeah but yeah for my mom are both very I
was so unenthusiastically like not
following anything to do with Apple
until I saw the Vegas thing which I'm
sure you're going to talk about but yeah
yeah I was going to get to the important
stuff Specter yeah I mean I don't know I
could see like my daddy was fairly
disabled liking voice command stuff but
I mean I can't bring myself to get an
Alexa or a Google home so why would I
want this
like I think part of the idea is if he's
like watching the TV or like cooking
food or something and he just doesn't
even want to pull his phone out he can
just talk to it and it's fine uh wait
hold on a second apparently J is way out
of sync he was an he well didn't sink
here
ah see I bring the old Tech Talk mantra
with me wherever I go
oh it's slightly behind yeah oh people
are like yeah he's way out of things a
hundred two hundred millisecond yeah
it's yeah okay um I mean there's only so
much you can do with video over IP right
Wow
okay you know what I think we're just
not gonna care at all so okay so
basically I'll say this I I have a sono
speaker actually I have a few so no
speakers and what I really like about
them is that you can turn on one room or
two rooms or a bunch of rooms I do think
some of those speakers are overpriced so
for Apple to come in and say okay yeah
we're going to have a home speaker that
is you know sounds great and is also a
competitor for Sonos and also happens to
have Siri for if you're wondering like
how tall the average giraffe is or
whatever sure then I guess there's I
guess there's some utility there but I
can't figure out who is actually using
apple homekit stuff and I can't figure
out what exactly it is that people other
than me have figured out how to do with
Siri that's actually useful that's one
of my bigger questions is because I like
I and I feel like it was actually better
before have you had that experience I
feel like my voice-activated stuff has
gotten worse over time almost every time
I go to use Siri like here let's do a
live demo hey Siri hey Siri can you set
a reminder for me to pick up my kids at
10 p.m. tonight okay I'll remind you
okay brought whatever manage to get it
right after hearing me the first time
but like so many times it'll it'll get
the it'll have like the time in the
reminder it'll be like oh well then
would you like to do that like holy crap
you literally have ten pee
right there I don't know how it could
have been much more clear than that and
I've just been so frustrated with it
lately that I just can't imagine myself
buying a dedicated appliance just to be
mad and after three attempts pull up my
phone and just freaking type it in you
know when I did my sono stuff last year
because I'm like you I have quite a bit
of sono stuff and it really had one
selling point for me and that was the
ask controlled volume and whatnot
because when you have toddlers and kids
like me who like to crank the TV super
loud it was just convenient to be
upstairs be able to turn the tv down so
having to yell turn the TV down like
that one feature alone for me was worth
it but I mean in terms of like home
assistance and home speakers and stuff
like that I don't use any of the other
functionality built into the SONA so the
exception of just being able to switch
it and maybe stream some music I apply
whatever to to play a little bit of
demographic and I guess no one's really
fighting for the other side but I I
think for like the the more normies out
there anatomy is that what we call them
now I I guess I think this serves
actually a better use case because it
fits the like super classic easy to
understand dynamic of like the the
person chopping vegetables in their
kitchen who like randomly thinks or
something and doesn't want to stop like
hey can you convert three quarters of a
cup to the metric system yeah and like
apparently it actually does that pretty
well I know your phone dude money pick
you up I could see my wife doing that
yeah and like I know your phone didn't
just pick you up very well but a
dedicated appliance 360 dollar appliance
for that bit of course though so again
back to okay so there's two discussions
to have here one is is this thing really
that useful and the second one is will
normies flock out and buy it so I don't
know about flock out and buy it well
hold on I was about to make an argument
there because when I was over in Taiwan
I stayed at Dennis's parents house for
the first day because our hotel wasn't
available to check in yet anyway
and they actually had like so many
dedicated appliances that my zero
clutter lifestyle would not allow me to
take for free let alone go out
and bye so like your own quarter
lifestyle they have a they have at home
you've never been to my house lately
have you yeah well okay I have kids -
yeah I have - exactly okay like my aunt
she has everything from like she has a
dedicated juicer just four lemons and
limes okay yeah yeah not a noodle maker
yeah she's got it okay she's got a salad
spinner and I'm sitting here going you
know what you know how you drive a salad
you kind of shake it over the sink and
you put it in a bowl it's done you know
that's like it's like the spending too
much time on QVC or the Shopping Network
right you just like oh that looks useful
when you buy it but then you really
never use it
so Dennis parents own an in-home sauna
and remember this isn't Taiwan it's not
huge I want it so bit surprising but if
I marry quickly in Finland there's a
sauna per person okay saunas are just
not that popular in Canada and and
number two they had this like like
writing thing that I posted on social
media that was like an exercise device
of some sort and I'm sitting here going
you know that is like the erotic Bowflex
you know yeah I think it was four core
exercises but man did it okay this is
what I want to know our people not
learning everyone goes out and buys a
rowing machine or a treadmill or an
ice-cream maker
everybody does it and they just keep
doing it what's wrong with a rowing
machine or a treadmill the fact that you
use it six times what I've never done to
use it yeah but those people are one in
a thousand that's true
that's weak we we have a chocolate
fountain just like those ones you'd see
it like a party or a wedding yeah I
don't ask you why but every time how
many times did you guys use that we've
never used it but we've lent it out
plenty of times so basically if you give
js2 cents doesn't end up working out for
you then you're going to start up a like
pointless bullshit white people
appliances rental house kitchen wounds
yeah yeah there is probably a business
there like like my parents my parents
bought the bought the slicer machine the
like v-shaped bleh
where you can like slice fries out of a
potato and just like one thing we had
the BAM --ax which by the way did pay
for itself in homemade mayonnaise you
can make mayonnaise in like minutes or a
mix I'm not trying to sell you the bad
mix okay but you know we had that line
that is so I really didn't know there
was that many people into homemade
mayonnaise
yeah but I don't think there are a lot
of people into it so much as there are a
few people that are really into it so
that make sense anyway my my take on the
home pod is okay it's got seven
beamforming speakers and a four inch
subwoofer and apparently Apple is really
excited about the sound quality they're
going after the Sonos play three with
extra functionality if it does all this
stuff really well then great but one of
the things I love so much about Sonos is
that whether I'm using an iPhone or an
Android device this week I can use it
regardless so I have to see how again
that's not a use case for like almost
anybody well okay I can go over to my
parents house and regardless of what
kind of phone I'm using I can tap into
so know some place in music which is
pretty cool well how about the fact that
the Sonos is also its own music server
too you can just offload your favorites
and create playlists on the phone oh on
your own songs on your own network
regardless of what devices are hooked up
to it
isn't it just speakers so knows ya know
it's like panic can it answer how tall
is an average draft no they can't do
that so then it's not really the same
thing though but the logic being that if
I'm going to buy a pod or whatever their
home pod if I'm going to buy a home pod
I probably already have one of these in
my pocket now I get a lot of somos mail
because I've signed up for their stuffs
like one of the few newsletters I
actually pay attention to and I there
was some early talk like late last year
earlier this year about there being an
assistant in development so I don't know
like a new assistant from Sonos probably
wouldn't be very good considering what
Apple and Wright and Microsoft have been
helped to do in this long of a time but
who knows and Entering out terrible
everything is yeah honestly I have no
faith
in a Sonos home assistant I just don't
need a home assistant no but you're not
like here something older all these use
cases for smart appliances let's talk
smart appliances for a minute ok I'm
going to lose now okay all these use
cases they're like yeah okay my what
what is it you can on juicer needs to be
connected to the Internet you're here no
longer work like I forget who it was I
think with Samsung showing a smart
washer and dryer yeah and they're like
yeah you could like control your washer
and dryer from a distance I'm like you
mean instead of when I actually put the
bloody clothes in yeah yeah getting
notification lead on your life done
correctly we have an LG smart
refrigerator okay okay what's it what's
it do why could why would I care it
warns you like when the filters need to
be changed if a door got left open
if it's under temperature a light on the
front of the fridge couldn't do that
well if the door got left open in your
upstairs because you're going to bed
again on the front of the rug an 8 year
old child we have a we have a piece of
paper on our fridge at work saying
please remember to close the fridge it
works for like 2 days to do it I'm just
saying these things are completely
useless and I think considering my
comment about normies being more into
Google home and all that kind of stuff
the Apple home pod might do better for
them than the watch did so targeting
people who can't figure out how to close
their fridge no but at the same time
like like like you say it's not going to
be very helpful for you because you
won't be chopping vegetables because
you're not the Malorie most now now ours
this also is hard oh it's a whoa shot
okay you go first day but I have to
address the shots fired over there okay
ours is that we're not doing those ones
that will like tell you what your lo of
in the fridge and automatically link it
to your Amazon fresh cart and whatnot I
mean we we do have the Amazon fresh like
scanner thing my wife likes to use that
but there's refrigerators out there that
will can tell when you're low on milk
and it would like automatically order it
for you okay we take and go that far I
can I could but I can actually see that
being useful where's the more
rudimentary stuff I don't know if I care
as much about okay and back to your I
don't need to convert metric to imperial
because I actually already noted you
want to
five mils tablespoon 15 mil don't care
one codger conversion 250 mils a leader
is approximately a course with a little
water a gallon is four liters
approximately it's about 3.7 5 liters ok
I can convert this crap in my head I
don't need an iPod I always hate
American so I need the help ok but not
everyone can and what if your kid ask
you a question and it's something super
weird and I'm going to make it up
because that's half the fun of being a
parent
daddy what what does it giraffe do all
day well son giraffes
actually play a long poker people don't
know this because you look at those
hoops and you think gee how do they even
hold the cards but giraffe like you can
see it's endless
ok you know you make it up no problem my
dad made things up to me and I turned
out just fine I say that explains a lot
[Laughter]
Brandon is yelling debatable laughing
crap Brandon um alright let's talk about
the new IMAX because I think basically
this explains how AMD managed to remain
so secretive about Vega because AMD
leaks everything but it seems like if
you're going to collaborate with Apple
and Apple wants to be the one to
announce the first desktop
you know Vega graphics card then people
probably ran around the office going ok
no for real this time for real this time
week bank ok don't leak Vega Apple wants
to do it and if we don't sell them to
Apple we're not going to have a lot of
customers no I'm salty about the whole
thing
ok alright so it hit me well ok so a.m.
AMD is kind of rebasing its whole
foundation right of community oriented
gamer oriented and we've been waiting
for Vega for quite a while right but I
feel a little bit stabbed to the back by
AMD that they're launching it in an
Apple product first I mean that's kind
of where I'm at with that so when the
news came out I basically just kind of
like facepalm and then turned it off
because at that point I just felt like I
just felt like AMD sold out on that one
now it's now it's no news that AMD
graphics have been in MacBook Pros and
that's for a while but I just feel I
just feel like the Vega that everyone's
been waiting for kind of going to a knot
or out for rate and I don't like it
either but I'm willing to give them a
little bit of benefit of the doubt
listening to what you're saying I hear
that but we all know that they need as
much money as possible that was there
was some amount of like they're going to
make more from this if there's some
amount of temporary exclusivity deal or
something then yeah I'm willing to give
it to them because I'm negative only if
it's only Vega Pro then I guess I kind
of make sense but we're still waiting
for more kind of gamer or mainstream
Vega but silver right now to my
knowledge Apple is the only Tier one
computer maker that not not forget about
being exclusive to AMD Radeon Apple is
the only Tier one PC maker that even
emphasizes AMD Radeon so I do understand
why Apple is getting some special
treatment here because even like so I
got a press release today that Acer is
doing like a $7.99 budget gaming desktop
I was actually thinking yet we might
actually pull it in for review because
cool it's uh it's right and based okay
yeah they still put a 1050 in it Wow and
it's just like not okay so part of a
problem is that supply is really tight
on the RX cards cryptocurrency mining it
again
super important again came back room but
part of it too is that like they're
competitive but they're they're not like
they're not like you know a green team
crushing solution at at any level in the
products that which that is so salty
that you said Tier one what tier one is
like a term you can define I know it's
not it's not an attorney I know upset I
mean they're gonna hate who the rest of
the tier ones are okay Dell HP Lenovo
what what did you think what do you
think I was going to say like Zeus
ms:i I'm sorry those got a bug
those guys are Tier one motherboard
manufacturers yeah but in the PC system
space solo enterprise they are what a
bind
okay I'm sorry get over it
so let's talk a little bit about the
device that Vega graphics are going into
I may do a dedicated video on this
actually just kind of discussing this
but J hit me with your thoughts on an
iMac Pro um okay so should I should I do
some approximate specs for the viewers
before do you kind of launch into it or
yeah because I was kind of yeah one of
something sure okay so let's let's do
some contacts for you guys so much like
the Mac Pro this is a balls-to-the-wall
machine we're talking up to 18 cores eon
we're talking up to 128 gigs of ECC Ram
we're talking radeon vega graphics a 5k
display four Thunderbolt 3 ports with
support for external GPUs so that Vega
GPU however they're implementing it
whether it's MXM or whether it's baked
right into the PCB is upgradeable in a
manner speaking up to a 4 terabyte SSD a
10 bit panel new black peripherals cause
that's important UHS 2 SDX cargill that
might be into the home pod in a few dues
500 watt power supply 1080p webcam
starting at $5,000 I mean this to me
looks like a pretty bananas machine but
it's in an all-in-one yeah I'm a little
surprised that they spent so much
emphasis on specs because given kind of
where they've been over like let's just
say the last eight years I mean you can
still buy an i7 dual core right MacBook
Pro so it just seems it just seems kind
of surprising to me that they actually
are going with the top-tier Hardware
this time around because Apple has
always been about software optimizations
right yes so I'm kind of wondering here
Ian you buy my product not a spec sheet
right Marian given the price suspects I
don't say end effect that's Apple I
actually don't think that price is
really like out of whack I think it's
right in line with where it should be
because you could build a similar Intel
based system to the same specs and spend
just as much yeah and that's that's true
depending though on what we are actually
getting for five grand that might be
maybe that's not Vega and maybe that's I
mean it's certainly not an 18 Rob it
does it does say it starts Vista starts
with eight cores Ian
so that would be maybe is it eight core
it does it have eight gigs of RAM right
like we roll up to 15k yeah you never
know how much apples going to kneecap
something honestly for me the thing that
I'm that I really take exception with
and the thing that again I might do like
some kind of a follow-up video on here
is that they are but that they're
calling it Perl that people that the pro
users got upset when they took away the
tower that you can put expansion cards
in and they gave us a cylinder that you
can clip that you can plug expansion
devices into and that now you know and
they did say earlier this year that
they're going to have something to
address the pro user I guess what I want
to know is was this it because to me
professional means modular upgradable it
means a path to continue using it and
the other thing that really upsets me
and that makes that makes apple's
desktop ecosystem almost impossible to
support as a business owner is the
unpredictability of it yeah if we go
back for the last ten years so we just
upgraded our editing workstations it was
kind of time it had been three almost
four years something like that and so
let's say over a span of 10 years if our
company were to have followed a typical
upgrade cycle of three to four years we
would have had towers we would have had
cylinders we would have been stuck with
old cylinders thinking holy crap are we
going to have to just go straight to
laptops and then Apple would have dumped
an a i/o on us with that hold on a
second I mean what if we just upgrade
our displays apparently know the new pro
version is coming probably sometime in
2018 okay which still doesn't address my
fundamental problem with Apple not
having a clear strategy in a
professional environment
I need to know what my upgrade path is
right so that if I'm going to invest in
a bunch of brand new 8k displays Ellen
say exactly I need to know that the new
machine that I'm going to have available
to me is going to make any sense oh wait
oh this one comes with a with a with a
display already in it like I just I
don't understand apples Pro lineup so
that's kind of where I'm that's kind of
where I'm going with that is this the
first iMac Pro though I'm not sure yes
it is I think okay yeah so they're just
in there just introducing them the new
Pro line of IMAX but for the so then
okay based on the hardware available in
the iMac is the new MacBook Pro or CD
the new Mac Pro coming out in 2018 going
to be essentially the same hardware in a
tower format with a i/o water-cooling
again I mean I was kind of wonder what
the next tier of hardware could be I
kind of wonder - like I would love for
Apple to just go straight back to basics
here's a tower here's where the
expansion cards go here's how you add a
fricking hard drive that's connected to
a SATA interface instead of connected to
a thunderbolt interface for some reason
their desktop side of their enterprise
has always been more concerned with the
form factor than anything else yeah so I
don't know that's that's where I'm at on
that I'm glad that they do have a
legitimate professional you know
high-end great option but I'm frustrated
that Pro products are being treated as
basically disposable rather than being
able to upgrade the graphics which is
good but the fact that we're doing this
over thunderbolt means that there is
going to be some kind of bottleneck that
exists already and can only get worse so
we did a fairly thorough I think
investigation where we looked at alien
wares graphics amplifier versus the
razor core and found that already with a
top two
10 atti there are performance
differences between a straight PCIe
interface and Thunderbolt 3 with all the
extra overhead and people criticized us
they said we'll loan this no one's going
to put a 1080 TI in that thing and I'm
sitting here going well that wasn't the
point the point is that three years from
now when it is time to upgrade your
graphics card something with the power
of a 1080 Ti is going to cost $1.99 yeah
and that's exactly what you're going to
put in it yeah well I just played around
Thunderbolt 3 for the first time earlier
this year with you know the external
graphics card solutions and that's a lot
of thing that you did in fact it was so
this performance degradation was so bad
over even thrown about three that I had
to get confirmation that the anywhere
between 25 to 35 percent performance
loss was normal so oh yeah that's normal
okay then what's the point of buying top
tier graphics like this when it's just
going to dumb down to a tear or to lower
on the graphics solution so like like
you're saying though if using an
interface like that is the option to
speak forwards compatible then you're
just cutting yourself off at the knees
and the ankles everything as you go
forward one note about this new iMac I
don't know what versions I know there's
the pro and I believe there's gone pro
new versions yeah the only thing I've
seen is of the non pro but I'm assuming
it's the same for both yes the CPU and
the RAM are both replaceable yep that
was true of previous iMac but not GPU
still but not like we're talking about
anyways okay so that's frustrating um
and I kind of doubt people are going to
be super hardcore throttled by at least
the CPU part of that you might be able
to get away with the classic Mac thing
where you buy the one with less ram and
then upgrade the RAM yourself because
it's way freakin cheaper but who knows I
don't know it's interesting yeah so I
don't know I still haven't decided if
I'm going to do a piece on it it kind of
depends whether I can sort of come up
with a coherent enough argument but it
is something that I've wanted to talk
about for quite some time apples sort of
schizophrenic approach to professional
prodigy overs who's Merrick bro oh lordy
I don't well I don't necessarily so it's
too early in the surface product lineup
in yeah for me to really talk about you
know Microsoft strategy because right
now it's really hard to tell what it is
I can't discuss
one creator family whatever that really
means yeah whatever creator means I mean
this thing spanks the surface studio on
paper anymore why is good for me yeah
and upgradability will hi Stevens
yeah service studio is horrible now your
nightmare to get into yeah um so should
we do the big announcement the reason
that Jays on the show today
no yeah to do that now actually no what
no what we're kidding to is do it after
the ad Wow
so why don't we why don't we do our
sponsor callouts first yeah um hold on I
just want to do I want to do a quick
tweet you want to start one of them and
then not Jade should we just we'll just
we'll just put you away for now
okay I'll duck out of the way okay cool
I'm going to conveniently start with
savage for jerky yeah yeah dog can I
have some which is this any box this is
not a new box
oh okay oh yeah probably I mean how does
jerky go bad yeah okay should I take on
the reaper today what did you do last
time I don't remember I think I did the
second thought the one with that like
has more set five bars don't ya the
reaper's five bar savage jerky fairly
self cleanser it's it's jerky or you can
get bacon naturally to make maple bacon
that's mine you don't get any freakin
get ready one rough everyone I'm gonna
do the do we have a Carolina Reaper
that's already open um there we go there
we go yeah we got we got an open one
this one's not as popular just to eat
for lols because it oh no we don't have
an open one I don't think we've done
this once into the last spot because if
you are into spicy jerky this is like
for you
I'm not that into spicy jerky there we
go mojo habanero that's my favorite one
they all come with generally four bars
of heat on the front so tell you how hot
it is
mojo habanero is a three the reaper is
special it comes with five bars and
they're all filled because it is just
more hot than freaking anything savage
jerky is a sponsor of ours they they use
the best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives
their goal is to create a snack that is
full of flavor and spice and won't
actually be bad for you apparently their
inspiration came from the flavor of
garlic lime and cilantro
I believe that it you can taste it and I
will follow them if you can I still have
taste buds that workout yes if you go
for the Reaper you might want to taste
it for long you'll taste it for a little
bit of start and then it goes away I
don't fear the reaper or the wind or the
rain we could be like they are come on
baby
apparently outside of this just the
traditional flavors most people go for
sriracha bacon or maple buffalo bacon
which makes sense so good - is Griffin
sea but yeah they're pretty freakin good
they have a whole bunch of different
flavors they're really into the spicy
stuff Hank and Davidge if you're into
that so you can check them out over at
savage jerky calm and once I figure out
how to get the package open because
apparently they don't have stupid people
proof packaging and I mean I've opened
the bowl flawlessly but anyways you know
I've had enough of your crap what if you
use offer code LPG panic you know so
you'll save 10% on your orders okay so

they're awesome there's no reason not to
love those guys on the railroad logs and
they do other stuff now - well he had a
guy beautiful so the other guy whose
name I always forget he's a bomb - you
did a pretty good job with that let's

guys because they sponsored scrapyard
Wars and we bring Jay back in now so Jay
you want to do the honors what exactly
what why why were you in the credits for
all the episodes did you take away my
bacon No
where did my bacon go we never make it
random rage no oh wait yeah that is
buffle ok I'm not upset anymore
ok ok carry on sorry I was about to get
real real angry cuz I thought my bacon
jerky was gone ok carry on Jay I think
it's funny because I think IDI put the
credit suffer after the first episode I
think the credits were up and showed me
their yeah right next to Jonathan who
could have said their thanks for
learning and putting it when we needed
it and other stuff right and some folks
there's some pretty sharp people out
there in the audience and they were like
oh I guess we know who the celebrity
judge is like no clearly I loaned them
equipment that's why I'm down here I'd
like like that Tweety guy because I was
trying to this is probably the hardest
secret ever kept we're like what 3
months like 3 months past this it's been
arrived yeah so I always be the guest
celebrity judge on the RDB Factor uh-huh
so uh scrapyard Wars Episode four have
you seen it yet I have you have okay
just okay so you got early access to it
so scrapyard Wars Episode four is coming
this weekend I think it's going to be on
Sunday and without any spoilers I think
it's fair to say this J is a very
impactful member of the character for
the fourth and final episode he not only
you know did what he did as our
celebrity guest he also lent us his
studio space which was very generous
and he hung out with us until the wee
hours of the morning because how many
messages did I send you saying yeah hey
we're not coming yet it's going to be
later hey actually it's going to be
later right now talking just stand
around for a little while okay III I
think there's an opportunity to sit on
the couch here and watch some TV and
some Netflix something I never get to do
cuz I clean the studio right like okay I
want a fresh slate for you guys you'll
set up however you want it to you know
take take rain in space I only moved in
two weeks prior to that so it was pretty
empty right compared to now like you
have to because walk sideways you go
down the hallway but ya know it was it
was it was fun because I got to see
scrapyard Wars for the first time
literally from the finale backwards
because it's like okay I see how it ends
I know how it ends but have no idea how
we got here so it was really weird even
for me you know because I knew you kept
saying these texts like we're delayed
we're sorry we're delayed we're sorry
and I'm just like oh my god what is
going on over there I'm thinking this
better make for some good drama and it
didn't disappoint so for those of you
who want to watch scrapyard wars episode
4 early I'm actually posting a link in
the chat floatplane club is our early
access platform that we've got over on
the Linus tech tips forum that we would
love to open up to other creators at
some points are II I think some of those
costs are legitimate cuz the jerky no
not all of them but this is the maple
bacon jerky
okay now that stuff's fine only only the
worst of content creators would consider
such a platform yeah early access you
got nothing but hurt the audience except
when they don't notice that it's
happening yeah except when that happens
yeah also you know it kind of helps the
creator there is the whole ad pocalypse
thing going on yeah I know if anybody
noticed that yeah alright okay but that
is literally killing should we get back
to maybe about 10 more minutes and news
and then we'll bid adieu to J and bring
on Nikki V for one final and show stream
yeah dude um actually okay we kind of
touched on this but this is sort of sort
of a big deal
AMD's GPU supply exhausted by
cryptocurrency so I'll go ahead and
screen share
you're real quick here so if you've been
running out there trying to buy an Rx
for 70 or are up excuse me 570 sorry any
or any of them Lesley Freudian slip
a 570 or a 580 yeah you've probably had
a bit of a hard time because people are
let's see let's have a look at what this
stuff is so what are these coins I don't
even know have you been keeping up with
this day only a little bit see I
realized it was starting to pick back up
in popularity when it was becoming
difficult to sources because I'm getting
to the point where I'm just kind of
buying and building the systems on my
own right not taking sponsorship on
everything so I went and tried to
legitimately buy these for for a video
and I'm like I can't get any rx based
graphics card 400 or 500 series and it
was just like what a hex I started
researching it and it seems like we've
gone full circle right because at the
beginning everyone wanted less power
consumption and and they wanted the auto
camera with what it's actually called
when they do the hashing or whatever
right and they wanted they wanted more
efficiency on that so they kind of
started coming across with these
custom-built computers I think Jerry did
a really good video about you know the
progression of Bitcoin mining and then I
don't understand how we got back to here
though well it looks like it's aetherium
mining that people are really into right
now series okay yeah so I actually had
someone internally pitching to me that
we should do a Bitcoin mining update now
like not Bitcoin but cryptocurrency
mining update and I was like oh really
that again and I didn't really look into
it I really should have because then we
could have been a little bit more more
topical on and pretty huge yeah but
what's what happened again Bitcoin right
now because no matter what people are
mining they're all converting it out
anyways so yeah Bitcoin is equal to
three thousand seven hundred ninety-four
Canadian dollars so there's a big gold
rush again basically yeah I can try to
have US dollars which is that's one
whole but going right because I didn't
say also you get them in bits right yes
you get par so it's two thousand eight
hundred and twenty four ish US dollars
per Bitcoin which makes huge if you can
see the care harassed by can you say jak
1 BTC 2 USD so I'm going to go ahead and
share that with the audience here you
know
so they go the chartered seas you can
see the big yeah you can see a Papa
goldrush fabulous 2014 8 2013 early 2014
oh sorry that was mid 2014 yeah now they
did a crock cool dolls and it was juice
mm-hmm
and then in the last since since the end
of last year it's gone from like 500
bucks to over 2000 and it's very close
to over 3k which is pretty insane yeah
I'll be incredible so once again I've
missed out once again I suck at
everything but I'm I'm over it ah what
else we got here um pci express 4.0
specs finalize the original articles
from tech report and also in other news
PCI Express 5.0 with announced ray so
it's going to be 16 Giga transfers per
second on tap
so basically we're doubling it again
so that's really important on the server
side of things am less important for
consumers so yeah I mean I guess is cool
in the sense that like consumer
platforms that don't have as many PCIe
lanes will be able to run like I mean at
this point you're going to be able to
run in what a 1x slot or like a like a
4x lot what you used to be able to run
in a hold on a second so that would be
an 8 X 2 16 okay hold on a second you're
going to be able to run in like a 2 X
slot which I believe does exist but no
one implements it I recall correctly
what you would have been able to run in
a 16 X lot back in Gen 1 so that's
that's cool right pretty cool that's
cool are we excited throwing stuff into
big 16 X slot things isn't really going
to be a big difference though um yeah so
it still needs to undergo a final review
by some scale of 1 to 10 J how excited I
mean I I don't do my workflow doesn't
really matter that much on on PCIe
throughput but yeah is there a timeline
on that um well right now it still needs
a couple little things one big question
is whether or not AMD and Intel will
even ball
they're to implement PCIe gen four on
consumer parts the havea whoa yeah the
time line could be who knows yeah on the
server side of things though PCIe Gen 5
which will double it again designed to
offer 128 gigabytes per second of total
bandwidth will allow us to have 400
gigabit per second Ethernet solutions
like that are super sick cool so that's
like amazing yeah
oh this is fun we're already like we
have like no contact at Samsung
whatsoever because we suck but we saw
this earlier this morning we're like yet
need to get our hands on some of that
Samsung announced I think it's a 32 by
132 by 9 sorry a wide aspect ratio
monitor Venus have you got this yeah
it's like three four by threes yeah
that's ridiculous it that that is curved
but yeah it is you have what three sync
yeah for gamers that's pretty wild
144 Hertz 1ms response time HDR 10 free
sync to quantum dot all that there all
those all the buzz works
Samsung's one of those companies were
like they have world-class display
technology and just no idea yeah like I
stopped by their booth I think it was
like to see ESS ago and they were
showing off like a free sync monitor and
they didn't have the refresh rate and
nobody in the whole booth I swear I
asked like eight people including like
the guy who was in charge of the monitor
section knew the refresh rate I'm just
like you know that's actually like the
important spec well I can only monitor
right it's kind of like when I was
shopping at Fry's Electronics so if you
guys had those up there but Fry's is a
big electronic store here in the states
and yeah I was shopping for panels I was
looking at high refresh rate stuff and
they had them all hooked up to HDMI so
it was like not a single panel was
actually displaying anything towards
like what possibly could I tried to
explain to the to the manager of that
section I like you need to put display
ports on these he was like no that's
HDMI it's fine a curious audio to them
like
yes they'd not get boring dude
my wife has hit me on that one and even
cheat me more and she like doesn't care
about any of this stuff she was like
yeah I don't think that's supposed to
look that way terrible alright last one
before we bring on Nikki V Intel coffee
Lake CPUs delayed so the rumor that
Intel is going to be releasing six and
four core coffee Lake processors on
their main stream platform this year it
seems to have been quashed it will
instead be apparently and this is all
rumors sometime in February of 2018 can
you imagine how much of a better
position Intel would be in today if they
had brought six core before AMD launched
driving yeah if KB Lake was six core I
think they could have but they got very
complacent over the last decade on
theirs out on their own roadmap and in
fishing stuff off I think this should
begin the - and J collab angry session
angry that the anger the tuna and I talk
I want to I want to say something real
quick I took a lot of flack like are
just copying line is cuz it a viral
video I said that day in Computex I
looked at Nick and I said Monday we're
recording this we're recording my
thoughts on this this is days before you
and I ever talked about it and before
your video ever went up the difference
if you took advantage of walking in the
rain we took advantage of walking in the
rain you wait for that whole like
depressing I'm surprised that you ever
edited that video didn't put a gray hue
on there to and just make it super
depressing but I saw that video I was
like you but no I had I had to do it
anyway
I mean okay there's so many things you
talk about right I mean I shot that
video like four times I kept kind of
dumbing it down to like I was rambling
so long on that and but there's so many
things that are wrong with that all the
way down to a paywall four raid I mean
what the hell man haha I I liked that
one I don't even know cuz like I'll tell
you this like even on the server side so
I recently rolled out an nvme storage
server so it's got 48 nbme bays
and I actually had some issues with
Intel's rst enterprise drivers where
it's limited to maximum 12 Drive and
that was just like a tech limitation
that was like a driver limitation it
wasn't like a paywall thing they weren't
asking for anything it just straight-up
had no way to do that and I actually
wanted to run Chipo our ste raid5 on
that high-speed math and the reason for
that is that I'm doing real-time
replication of that Nazz to a separate
box so ultimately if I only have one
drive of redundancy or it just kind of
craps the bed I'm going to switch
everybody over we're going to be editing
off the other box while I rebuild it and
gave it mean it'll be inconvenient but
it's not the end of the world yeah so I
couldn't do that because of like a
driver limitation well now I'm wondering
if I'm not going to be able to do that
unless I buy an expensive dongle because
if they're doing it on X 299 yeah get
like two more minutes if they're doing
it on X 299 then they're probably going
to do it on the server side too right
yeah I guess they could probably go both
ways right if they're if you are you
paying the enterprise solutions on this
on the server side of things maybe it
would be implemented but then again that
kind of sucks too I mean because then
you're talking about double standards in
terms of their of they're just a bit
mentality regarding how they want to
implement and roll out this stuff to me
this honestly feels like they just were
caught off guard by a lot of of things
happening in the industry right now and
I feel like what it kind of flipped on
them a little bit is their official
response regarding Verizon was I felt
like the consumers are going to take a
wait-and-see mentality regarding how
well they want to adopt rise in I don't
know I feel like everyone jumped on rise
in and now I wants to wait and see with
Intel yeah because I mean that is such
an ignorant like why would why would
people wait and see when I see what
you're either building a computer or
you're not yeah and of course Verizon
like every other new lunch had some had
some growing pains in the start but so
did x99 you know and so I mean it's one
of those things were like today and that
was a big thing I asked a lot of the the
motherboard manufacturers and ODMs out
there at Computex was are things better
on Rison now and they all really assured
me like yeah things have matured the
drivers are good the memory stability
and support is there
compatibility is good and they basically
were telling me like hey you should you
should maybe try out rise in a bit again
because I did it for the first 30 days
it lodged had a couple of weird
idiosyncrasies there but then I just
kind of moved on to my Intel system
which is already together and I use it
for work yeah but I find myself now like
okay I should probably I should probably
on it take another crack at it but I
would love to see the thread Ripper
stuff only because like just like your
workflow it's like I would I could take
advantage of all of those course yeah
but even the 1,800 X is a good is a good
place to to look at for absolutely sheep
Enterprise Solution
I wouldn't convert all of our editing
machines over any time soon just because
like I mean you know what we're gonna
have a video coming out where we roll
all of our editing machines up to ten
core 6950 X's and already on our early
access people are like yo what what the
heck
intel has new stuff what about thread
Ripper what about this what about that
ability isn't it man I'm iris ponded
there and I'll respond proactively now
to everybody else it is no coincidence
that about six months or four months
before x99 launched all our editing
machines moved to 49 60 X's on X 79 yeah
there is something to be said for
something that is powerful enough and
has had three years to work out all the
potential issues when you're talking
about a workstation for what you for
what we do maturity is way better for us
than just raw power and cutting edge
bleeding edge technology they call it
bleeding edge for a reason yeah and if
it was for myself no problem I'll run
whatever random crap beta drivers
whatever but if I have a room of not
necessarily techie people that are going
to come to me every time there's an
issue with it yeah nah man I like the
scooter 50 X isn't new either no it's
not imagine that great immediately went
to launch I'm doing exactly the same
thing yeah I'm going at the end of the
platform cycle yeah and I have a little
problem with that out of curiosity
what's your take on 69 50 X versus 7900
Kayden Garcia Isaac's 900
so eighty particular reason the XQ
because the whole upgrade
sponsored by Intel and if I can ask for
anything I want I might as well take the
69 50x it does perform in my
benchmarking I did a whole video on this
a while back marginally better good
margin was plus plus he just exited
sounds cooler yeah they have Exxon all
the new ones anyway Jane I have to give
the people what they want guys if you
love Jay then you can check them out
over at youtube.com slash Jays two cents
that's Jay with a Zed not to be confused
with Jay Z that guy has a - Jays does
not also over on twitter at @anjghie
tech man who's too salty about no wait
what is what is your Twitter handle
again if that Jay is two cents right
yeah I'm cross branded properly hey Pat
enough of your crap man alright anyway
so guys go check out Jay over there
thanks Jay for coming on the show and
I'm sorry I have to kind of kick you off
ever watch episode four go yes do that
alright thanks Evan me okay thanks man
I'm just gonna hang up no problem
yeah all right so this is it my friends
this is your last chance for Q&amp;amp;A with
the one the only
Mickey V who has some of his a civic
cake with him so this was a this was a
parting gift for for the one and only
Nicki B it's his last day today it's a
it's a cake in the shape of V of the
Civic it looks pretty good is a very
good recreation homemade Yvan homemade
yeah and that's good cake - except one
minor detail that I can't leave oh yes
these tires these are brown and you know
that the rims on that thing are orange I
noticed I thought remember that your
Civic rims are looking a little faded
these days mm-hmm I don't think we did
enough coats the rims are little faded
yeah you know want to know something
funny about the Civic well how long do
you think it's been since we painted it
uh it was in the spring I think no I
don't know maybe a year and a half
you're okay so um we moved in here I
think two years ago so it's been almost
two years that's a long time that car
has not been washed yeah inside or out
oh I know inside it isn't that time so
if the paint were to be damaged or faded
now it makes sense then but you know
what I think maybe maybe that maybe the
rims aren't fading though maybe they're
just covered in dirt but how are those
windshield wipers holding out they are
most excellent they're most excellent to
learn okay we got the questions rolling
in who is going to prank Dennis now who
are you handing the mantle over to I
would say who's got the capability I
think you have the pranking capability
but you don't have the time I think
Colton has the time but doesn't have the
ability maybe Colton maybe he's the next
prankster but I don't know I think
there's some people who could set up a
pretty good prank all right and of
course the number one question will get
this out of the way so people ask other
questions where are you going I am going
to the Linus tech tips of biking called
pink bike comm it's like if you didn't
know what by like if you weren't really
a mountain bike or anything you probably
wouldn't know about it but if you had
stepped foot on a mountain biker if
you've ever bought one or anything like
that it is like the the hub it's like
the the only source there's other
websites but this is sort of the og
gangster-ass website that started in
Calgary and then kind of like grew as
the sport became a sport from nothing so
pretty pretty awesome so this is as much
a question for me as anyone else what
exactly will you be doing there I'll be
making videos I'll be running around
with a guy named Brett Tippie he's like
I would say the only person I know that
is comparable in energy level to you I
would have I would I would run a pole
like if people who know the new boasts
both people I don't know who has more
energy you or him so it would be it
would be a pretty pretty good pretty
good battle but I'll be making videos
and doing some web content and stuff
for them and and you know how things
biking just trying to share my love of
biking with the world you know so I'm
pretty excited got someone asking will
you collab we like a lab there's not a
lot of overlap but I think it's
impossible
I saw the overlap and I've seen it with
my very own eyes nearly it's it would be
a Terran ebike thing of course
so lordy but he bikes or now like he
bikes have always just been like kind of
a laughing joke of mountain biking like
no who wants to ride any but they're
getting lighter yeah they're getting
lighter and they're liking them more
like off-road capable and now there's
some ebikes that are like somebody was
explaining it like the whole stigma
around them is that they're stupid
they're unnecessary it's just a bike
industry involved like innovating to
make people spend more money on shit
that they don't need sorry it's a swore
on here um but the what am I gonna do
fire you yeah I guess so you said today
hey you can pull the look on me today
one time I actually fire someone and it
actually means anything but they're
getting better in like the regard that
somebody was somebody explained it to me
really well they're like well you know
how downhill racing oh I'm falling away
downhill racing and stuff is always like
really intense and whatever but now you
could have it where you know you're
riding downhill and that's all scary and
stuff but then you're also like really
accelerating uphill which is kind of
awesome too
okay so what's going to happen to the
Nikki V character we've got people
asking you I don't know do we spoil it I
don't know I don't know what happens I
actually don't know well we do know what
happened I know I'm looking good for oh
no he's been if he if he doesn't die
from you know health issues from all
that pain inhalation and you know
drinking soft sand and all these sorts
of things that are just really not you
know we're gonna make you into a healthy
person I think he's going to suffer some
serious health complications in the
future but you know that's just for me I
don't know he probably has another
opinion on that
ah let's see what else we got coming in
here is very YouTube channel that Nikki
V will be on and I think they mean Nick
van Berkel I mean me I'm not going to
try and beat that character to death
I've tried to keep it as minimal like I
know there's lots of it but it's
something that can very easily be
overdone I would just try to do it once
in a while I probably won't be doing
that on my channel but if you want to
see my personal YouTube channel that is
always existed yeah you should have
known about if you wanted to see it it's
just called Burkle and I post a video
there like probably two times a year if
that maybe once here maybe I'll put some
more up I don't know well like when you
do videos full time for a YouTube
channel sometimes you like doesn't
really have time or energy to work on
your own channel so it kind of gets in a
cloud fit in okay I've got a tough one
I'm going to put you on the spot Shogun
potion asks what is your favorite memory
at LG hmmm favorite memory probably most
intense memory was that prank where you
rob the house and because that was like
five things at once it was we had a good
day like actually painting the car this
is all in the same day we went to line
as this house at like 9 a.m. or
something I started painting the car
then we did something else we played
badminton or something we ate pizza it
was like a great summer day we come back
and then all of this crap goes down with
the with the robbery and like I was
never been so fooled and so pranked in
my life that I like I was like I don't
know me but again no I don't think so
I don't think so Dennis tried to get me
with that tinder prank and he almost did
like the one where it was like somebody
messaging me about like like hey it's
bubble bluff from tinder and then I was
like wait I have a tender but I'm very
like uninvolved in the actual
conversation part I just literally have
it's almost like a game I don't use it
or like I use it but I don't like follow
up but then I was like what the hell and
then immediately after I'm like closing
my phone that's when Dennis comes by
with the camera like got you is like
doll you didn't I knew this all along
so we've got a lot of people asking
about LTX and okay
guest spots and I'll kind of jump in
this is something these are two things
or at least one of them that we've
discussed and I think it's kind of like
this is an amicable breakup but it's
still a breakup so I don't think either
side is really talking about like you
know here what are all the things that
we're going to do together in the future
the doors not being closed no and I
don't think I don't think anyone's
saying that they would refuse to walk
through a door that was open we're just
we're kind of going okay we're going our
separate ways and everything
everything's good there's cake um it's
been a hell of a ride yeah it's actually
crazy looking back in it because now it
seems like not a long time but then when
you think of all the things that we've
done in the meantime we've been crazy
there's been like years worth of the
pace that we go at here I think is like
maybe some other places like five 10
years of work that's the amount of
memory are you expecting a slower pace
because like I was you know I've done a
lot of reflecting like I'm brettelmer at
all like Germany like Mexico trip which
was like hectic it felt like we were
down there for months but like looking
back at it there was actually a lot of
like crazy kind of fun stuff tonight I
do think some of stuff is the same pace
like I am I've worked with these guys
once before in California and it was
really high paced but the one funny
thing was like because I'm so used to
like a crazy crazy turnaround that we've
had here for the last out on all three
years going to do something where it's
like okay this is gonna be stressful
event you got to get like you got to get
a like two videos done today I was like
no problem I've been doing this everyday
for like the last three years it feels
like fishin this would be a breeze but I
don't know everything's new challenge so
I don't know pace will probably be
pretty high whatever you do you set the
pace right so let it burn myself out of
that sorry well there'd be a replacement
editor actually I mean this is something
that it comes down to sort of
responsible business management you know
Nick had cut back to 60% earlier this
year so we had already proactively hired
an additional editor just in case cuz I
mean it's not been a secret ever
that your passion is biking and
snowboarding like I remember someone I'm
not going to name any names but someone
before we hired you said I'm not sure
how long he'll last because a real
passion is biking consider forking with
you know I'm funny I mean you came into
a group where you already knew a lot of
the people and they obviously knew you
fairly well so I remember I remember
even when the job was offered I'd
screamed it down and said I'm not gonna
take this job and you like you know what
come down and then I was convinced
easily that's it a high five
yeah never give me a hug no no you can
hug on one so you can do anything you
want on land show as long as it gets
which nipple showy yeah yeah oh oh all
right buddy all right get out of here -
volta crossing the line
people are asking what's going to happen
to channel super fun um we don't know
actually Channel super fun Nick or not
Nick has had kind of had some challenges
over the last couple of years we don't
know if it makes any sense the entire
twitch chat is cringing so hard Colton
so thank you for that that was the most
Awkward hug Finn's like my beard uncle
what's that I don't know I don't know
have a great weekend
see you later Colton like yeah what
caused it
Charles everyone's changed so much
because it was it started out as just a
side thing for fun when there is
downtime or like us I think to try
something out that didn't fit on the
other channels then it kind of turned
into like oh crap these numbers are
actually getting pretty good this might
be a legitimate Channel and then like
taking a different shirt I don't know
what these are they're good oh if you
label Buffalo's a literal piece of bacon
right on um yeah change so much that you
know you don't want to keep beating
something to death if it isn't like
organically growing so I think just
maybe a different approach or whatever
like you notice that over the past a
little bit
but there's some good golden era of
channel Superfund episodes that I still
love so much Carolina Reaper Turkey I've
eaten all of that jerky I'll tell you
one thing it is delicious there's one of
them know that like just killed the
insides of me it's too hot like you feel
it like everywhere it just destroys your
your entire inside so watch out for that
one um all right
I don't seem I don't actually see much
else here they want you to bring - cat
tips back yeah yeah I don't how off I
don't do that bring cold water on that
growing flower growing oh I I don't
remember the last time I uploaded
something there to be honest it's just
like it's so it comes down to when
you're busy making videos like a real
channel because the idea behind - cat
tips is it would just be me like tooling
around at home like playing with my cats
or whatever and like the last thing I
want to do when I have a minute to like
sit down and like cuddle with my cat is
like get a camera like I want to look at
a camera well that's been the same thing
with like my channel like I've always
just put randoms whatever project I had
been working on that I needed to put
somewhere on that YouTube channel I'm
but yeah like when you're if your week
consists of like shooting and editing
when you get off work and you're like oh
okay I need to go do something outside
or something like anything not related
to what I've just been sitting and doing
for lost you know eight nine whatever
hours yeah it's kind of hard to like
make a video at that point but sometimes
you can we got people asking if you're
going to make a goodbye video if you're
going to do final touch-ups on the the
Lamborghini and to that I will say we
have something special in mind as a
final as a final video so stay tuned
this won't be the last time you see them
but this is the last time you'll
physically be in the building the last
one will be live that's right I'm live
are you going to become a daily vlogger
I hope that nobody thinks that that's
what stuff to me like I'm like I hope
nobody thinks I'm gonna let go and try
and be a
all right now my main focus is my
youtube channel where I'm gonna daily
vlog my like no that's such a sad like
spin off thing I see so many people do
that like I don't know I can't I don't
know anyone named in particular but it's
like and then they make the first videos
like why I left BuzzFeed or whatever and
it's like that video will probably do
well because people be like oh why did
the stood then they watch it and then
it's like then you can't follow that up
with like oh this is what I ate this
morning and then nystatin yeah I just
know that's never been my style come on
you guys why I left by the speed slash
SourceFed are we going to see that video
why I left line of textin yeah cat and
then that thumbnail is going to be like
me like this like no that's no come on
who wants to watch that people want a
spoof of that yeah you know what so it's
not a terrible idea house can make that
video no all right so it's after 6:00
and the last thing I can do for people
who are officially not on the clock
anymore is keep them here after work
hours last thing I have for you is a
final parting gift
odd card well you might not want to read
it now it is actually a reference letter
oh wow you already have a job
Wow thank you very much I figure you
might not last long at it well thank you
very much appreciate so I proactively
wrote that up for you thank you very
much
I think it calls for an on-camera hug
lemon all right I'm getting my bid all
right and hashtag awkward I wanted to
keep it for just too long that's been a
hell of a three-year Jenna I appreciated
them all right thanks guys for tuning in
