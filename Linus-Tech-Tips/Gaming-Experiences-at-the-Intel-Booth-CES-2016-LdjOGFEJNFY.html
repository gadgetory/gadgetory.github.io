allowing us to be here at CES 2016 you
can learn more about Squarespace at the
link in the video description so over
here at the very front of the central
hall where Intel has taken up their
usual position and we're going to head
into the booth and see if we can find
some interesting gaming experiences
inside so here's our first gaming
experience we've found what the devil is
this thing yeah so this is a race car
simulator ok I know that much come on I
thought didn't think it was a spaceship
yeah so we make these race car
simulators with full motion and
realistic controls for training for
racecars alright well do you think you
can train me uh we'll see I can pretty
much assure you that you cannot but
we'll try we'll try we're gonna do our
best here shift up on the right shift
down on the left this is the reset
button when you crash you're gonna need
this button right but how realistic is
this thing I don't turn upside down
you're not gonna turn upside down but
you'll feel a jolt
alrighty then ok there's the brake
there's the gas don't need the clutch oh
hi ok I press the gas that's what
happened right there alright first go
slow yep that's what my wife said
that's not a good joke is there like a
track view like what's that that's how
far behind my time you are in this
sector oh my goodness I don't know
what's going on here oh crap
wow that is some force feedback right
there how many gears do I have okay
probably too many oh that's the wrong
way okay
and I'm referred oh no hey I didn't turn
it upside to okay the white button okay
I'm gonna try one more times okay oh
whoa oh okay that did that okay you know
the irony is that thanks to the force
feedback I feel much more in control
than usual Wow wow you really got a hold
onto that thing and there's probably in
miles anyway so I wouldn't understand
Oh the times up that's all no no no I'm
my I've had quite enough thank you so
this is a cool demo
intel has a real live professional gamer
here in the booth could you introduce
yourself yes my name is Stephanie Harvey
I'm also known as Miss RBI bleep Oh CLG
red so there you go and my understanding
is that she's here for the express
purpose of kicking the asses of random
newcomers that come to sit down and play
with her so this is going to be 3v1
even with teammates I suspect I'm not
going to do very well at all here is
that how it's gonna go down I have no
idea if you're good or not through we'll
see well at least she respects us enough
to wear her headphones so that's good
oh yeah that was quick
Wow it's actually lagging a little bit
here so that's good because that means
I'm gonna have an excuse when I die okay
not me
okay man I'm dead that's good I was
bound to happen
oh great all right I helped yes ah
that's what I get for standing still ah
the recoil it's too strong
hey you made us hold still for six
seconds and you shot me
should we come back later so the good
news is that bat went a little better
for me than I had initially hoped but
there are some well there were some
other factors at play here I think my
teammates were a lot better than me and
for another thing I don't know if you
observe this when I was just wandering
around on the map but there was some
very very significant lag which I'm not
exactly sure how would happen with a LAN
literally right here at a table but
either way there you go I've officially
killed a professional gamer once yes
whether it was an accident or not we'll
never know thank you for checking out
our coverage here at the Intel booth and
a big thanks to Squarespace for sending
