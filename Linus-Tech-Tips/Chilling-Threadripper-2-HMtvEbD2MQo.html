video and some of the bizarro random
cooling experiments that Alex and I have
done over the last several months is
that this time we're not in the
boardroom we're in the kitchen because
today's video is going to be completely
nuts now I showed you guys sub-zero
cooling on thread Ripper Gen 1 with my
own DIY water chiller but believe it or
not there's actually a commercially
available all in one nice tidy little
package version of that so we're going
to be taking this water chiller from
active aqua and we're going to be
hooking it up just the red Ripper to 32
cores of Sub Zero have they gone mad
have we no it seems fine seems perfectly
fine
origin pcs evil 15s is under an inch
thick and features a smooth 144 Hertz
1080p display with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX
1070 max Q graphics card check it and
their latest feels out by clicking the
link below
okay so first order of business is make
sure all of our hardware actually works
yeah okay so do I get to unbox the
chiller sure yeah go one tenth of a
horsepower I could get into that that
seems like a good thing I guess so
whoa what the what you said I could
unbox it and then you literally moved
immediately to the scissors and
immediately started unboxing it without
me all your waste a lot of time reading
what I get to unbox the tubing yeah you
know what I'm not gonna do that then you
do it yourself
there you go here's Alex's first
unboxing I'm not even helping him all
right so we've got some fittings here
they look boring
oh that's heavy
well that's more that you need to know
so power cord it's a heavy power cord
and we've got the chiller here which
normally you'd flip around but you can't
flip her own chillers so we've got your
back to the audience you're failing
right now you're failing okay so hold on
this has a compressor in it right so you
don't want to tip it over
that's what I just saying oh well it
wasn't clear do you want to grab it in
okay wow that is a lot more compact than
the one that I made out of a window
mounted a/c unit recommended water
reservoir size 13 250 gallons okay and
what is this for it's for chilling
aquariums oh okay so it's designed for a
continuous load so that's good we
considered in advance that these are
fittings that we probably don't have
already right right where did that come
in the box you thought of nothing no I
looked at the thing well maybe the
audience would know about all the things
that are on the box if maybe you told
them during the unboxing experience
terracing that I said was there
our feelings just to set the right size
for this yes all right fine yeah and I
figure that this can go between this and
the pump and then we can put it into
good stuff between here did we buy a
pump yes you know we have lots of pumps
right yep but this one has more gallons
per hour or whatever the measurement is
really than the little giants well I'm
getting a little answer but you don't
know what the little giants are uh hold
on can we still return this is this
still in like new condition
yeah I'm gonna go get a little giant
trust me you'll like my little giant see
that is a real man's pump it'll give you
lots of head pressure yeah think zip
ties are nothing good enough yep Tyson
okay I can do that if you want to get
the next rendering so further was
reservoir I was kind of thinking instead
of bothering with doing a whole lot we
could just stick the tubes right into
here and duct-tape it on okay I mean the
most important thing when you're going
sub-zero with some kind of alcohol-based
coolant is making sure that any plastics
that you're using are not going to get
destroyed by it any seals and gaskets
this is that new MSI board the creation
do we want to use this one or the zenith
that already has all the residue and
crap all over it
apparently the VRMs on that one are
better for spread Ripper to dial all
this is just the first test so well it's
just gonna see what happens to go from
there cool I kind of have some fittings
for the block here
thanks we can probably just like goatse
stretch of 3/8 inch over there yeah yep
you got it oh it doesn't have to go on
up we're never gonna get that off well I
guess did we just turn the pump on now
and make sure or hope that nothing leaks
that's kind of what I was planning to do
all right
to those watching at home the worst part
of all of this is that this loop will
perform significantly better than yours
okay I'll try not to drink windshield
de-icer here okay
the pump is
primed cool this thing broken your
little Giants really impressing me
fortunately I have enough I could have
had this running by now this one's even
bigger oh great yeah this is the big
giant no now I wish we'd left a little
more slack on the lines let's do a quick
tubing swap here okay perfect
dang it Alex how do I avoid drinking
windshield ice right now oh man yeah
that's that's what I told you yeah okay
so hold on
so write this okay perfect
then we're not gonna put that on so
tight this time okay good to go
ha ha let's hope powered on
haha success TM seems to be working okay
so now what I guess we should just fire
up the bench boom let's do it oh and it
turned off that's okay it's probably
just the classic double post so our
systems already not posting that's a
good sign
you know what I'm gonna start unwrapping
the zenith alright I don't actually know
that that's the problem it's probably
not but go ahead and cut hey it boot it
up on like the fourth attempt oh good
good job
alright I'm trying the other board oh
wow that is a lot of I might have
overdone the thermal compound a little
bit that it's just like Vaseline kicked
around the RAM very poor quality
Vaseline by the way if you've never
installed a thread Ripper CPU before
it's like nerve-racking actually the way
you got a go at it if it didn't have a
little torque stop I don't think I'd put
it that tight you see that flicker on
the RGB lighting I don't think it is the
GPU we just lost a twenty nine ninety WX
I'm gonna be pretty choked yeah that
would suck because that how it's
supposed to go let's just let's just go
for it again
maybe it's the RAM some days I feel
really bad for the viewers at home it's
like they're watching a horror movie no
don't go into that closet why would you
do that everyone else who went in there
died
boom okay so it's just a bad man oh good
let's see if we get a post here
Oh code right here detects memory
all right don't maybe grab some other
stuff yeah I figured out the problem
what was it old BIOS this red ripper one
we need to USB Drive
can we just use the other board at this
point I think it's faster to flash the
BIOS okay I'm sorry all right well
there's a bunch of RAM yeah thanks
so for an hour in and we have not yet
booted thread Ripper - to verify that
our system does in fact work but we have
the latest BIOS on our board now
theoretically this is it um wait for it
they don't put postcodes in the manual
anymore I have confidence that this time
we will post
haha I mean we've achieved nothing
because we still can't boot okay do you
want to run and grab the drive off my
bench all right okay that's a good sign
actually okay and that noise is driving
me nuts right now
all right so change graph to logical
processors lol so many CPUs so I'm just
gonna put some GPU drivers on here still
we've got rising master software and
alex has pulled out the thermal camera
so right now our CPU sitting at about 45
degrees because it's had a considerable
amount of time to warm up like these
tubes are warm to the touch so I think
now is the time for us to turn this
thing on yeah I guess so okay
well this is somewhat anticlimactic
where's it even taking the temperature
for us oh that's it something
thirty-nine that's the limit or Celsius
against LCS so howhow do we want to use
this do we want to use it in a way
that's practical to just chill water
down to a little above the dew point and
say okay this is the best-case scenario
for you know normal water cooling
performance or do we want it like like
chilled I think we should do chilled
okay like we've already screwed up that
motherboard so what do we have to lose
besides CPU we have another one the
wraps we have more
we've never recommend that anyone run
below ambient or below the dew point on
an ongoing basis without protection but
I mean we're just doing a thread refer
to overclocking experiments so where's
that shop towel stuff you had we'll just
put some of this around the socket this
is a really nice yeah
seem like a pro insulation job oh boy ah
even with all this airflow over the CPU
socket area and the VRMs our block is
still that's it's pretty wet sweating
but on the plus side our CPU is idling
at what five degrees seven yeah seven
why does this just say overload Watts oh
here we go
okay I'll go ahead and hit it oh I just
did oh you did is it done yeah what the
hell yeah it was pretty low score to 48
64 so we're at about a hundred watts at
idle can you hit it again I want to see
what we peek at sure
whoa 335 watts while Cinebench a okay so
we got just over 5,000 Cinebench which
is about what we expect so that means
our CPU is doing 250 Watts already we
haven't even overclocked it it hit a
maximum of 24 degrees so way
come on 40 yes 40 no no that's changing
a lot of variables at once so we're at
wool we're idling at 140 watts now all
right I'm gonna hit it now Oh 45 80
give me crash
no 6220 $0.09 avenge that was too easy
the CPU is sucking over 500 watts what
the hell who does in do you think they
are Intel maximum of 39 degrees well
should we try and go faster I guess so
so I tried to launch Adobe Premiere and
it just turned off yeah I don't know if
we're stable there's a lot of water on
there
should we cut the power to this let's do
that it's possible if there's water on
the underside hard to say yeah we could
we could pull that up and have a look at
it
actually no bone-dry it's really wet in
there so we might have killed our chip
if we don't manage to revive it then
this is the end of the video and we're
back to life how long how many hours did
we leave it for it was fine after like
three yourself yeah okay fantastic so
we're not gonna go quite so low again
we're at 59 freedom units whatever that
is and there's there's good news though
what do we got so it's currently at 4.1
didn't change the voltage I guess it's
just fine maybe we're at 19 degrees idle
now which is a lot more reasonable at
this room temperature and have we done a
stress test yet
no okay start with Cinebench sure over
6000 she would try for 4.2 update and
restart oh there are updates okay well
why don't we do that first oh this might
be a while oh it seems like a lot of the
issue was just that your crappy SSD died
it might have not even been the
condensation oh I mean honestly I don't
think we really need to run anymore
benchmarks to determine that this works
really well yeah so the main takeaways
here are that this is really compact
cools really well and I'm gonna turn off
the stupid pump without the noise from
the pump and that industrial fan well
it's not on right now but we can get it
to kick on though here you want to just
yeah set it at least 4 degrees lower and
then it should kick in
that's actually not too bad yeah it's
really not loud so let us know in the
comments would you like to see this
cannibalized and integrate it into a
system that's a really loaded question I
sure would
