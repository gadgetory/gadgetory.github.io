brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series we've got Chris Cook
director of public relations at
wargaming and they are showing off not
one but two extremely exciting things
here at the show we are going to be
starting with World of Warplanes so give
me the basic concept assume they've
never heard of wargaming they've never
heard a world of tanks they know nothing
so what we're known for as a company is
free to play games digital we hit really
really well with World of Tanks 70
million registered players around the
world a completely free to play game
that is really about taking some of the
world's most iconic tanks from the world
world to era pitting them against 15
verses 15 player matches it's really fun
it's been hugely successful World of
Warplanes is really our next chapter in
this war gaming universe same concept
completely free to play 15 verses 15 PvP
but really taking a lot of the iconic
planes and more birds from the late 30s
to the early 1950s and letting players
just really get into a game have fun and
improve as we got what it takes now
let's go ahead let's make it even more
basic let's assume they've never heard
of free-to-play they have no idea what
that means what is your monetization
model for World of Warplanes because
obviously this booth wasn't free sure so
what we're known in for is like you just
mentioned free-to-play games we're a
digital download game I'm here to
download a client installed on your PC
but there's no cost for that and there's
no cost to play the game where we make
money is um in-game monetization we have
in-game purchases one thing that really
I think sets us apart and what makes us
really proud is that none of our in-game
purchases purchases give you an
advantage in battle so you're buying
things from us like skins and
customization things to make your your
tank or playing look cooler you're
buying consumables that you use in the
heat of battle that are only temporary
but nothing that you buy is going to
make you better than player B or C or D
we really pride ourselves on making our
games all about skill we don't want
anyone whether your pain or you're not
paying at all to feel like you're better
or you have a better advantage anyone
else okay so let's talk about balance
then the world of warplanes is obviously
a completely new challenge in terms of I
mean it's a completely different type of
game so what have you guys done to make
Khan combat interesting tell me at the
top to our top three things we know it
think we really spent the game up you
know World of Tanks is a game that's a
little more methodical a little slower a
little more strategic obviously when
you're in a plane you're moving
constantly so you know you're doing
things that take a lot more I guess I'm
mental recognition of the battlefield
and we're all the enemy players are
where your teammates are now you know
we've done a lot of cool things like
really making sure that the geography
and the environments are going to play
heavily into battle things like canyons
cities even things like clouds and Sun
light can be used by the player while
they're fighting that is incredibly cool
now obviously a question that I'm sure
I'm not the first person to ask you is
is there some kind of a plan to take
world of tanks and World of Warplanes
and combine them into world of tanks and
warplanes and whatever else the case may
be I think maybe someday we'll look at
that right now we're really focused on
getting world of warplanes has done out
the door on September 26 to the US and
make sure that we really we build it and
grow with a lot of cool content like new
modes new nations new planes down the
road maybe the real challenge is is
making sure that it's balanced because
what we don't want is a player in a tank
to get blown up by a plane that's 10,000
feet above them and have no real way to
stop it you know I mean we want the
experience to be great whether you're in
a tank or you're in a plane or whether
you're in a warship because we have a
game world of warships coming next year
as well we want to make sure that no
matter what you choose you're gonna have
a fun time it's going to be balanced so
we'll look at it it's something that
we're always looking at and definitely
as you said before lots and lots of
people ask us about it so we'll see
maybe a little bit further down the line
great thank you so much and I enjoy the
rest of the show cool thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
