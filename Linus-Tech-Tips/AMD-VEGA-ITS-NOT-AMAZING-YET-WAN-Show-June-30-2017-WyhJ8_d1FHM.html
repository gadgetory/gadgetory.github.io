whoo we got that going no problem no big
deal not a thing yeah oh there's the
thing but it's it's an okay thing so
we've got a great show for you guys
today I'm here Luke's here and John
might be making an appearance really a
perv one specific topic oh do we have
another legal topics yeah well I see you
know those are actually some of the most
interesting ones for me because you'll
go off on something where he's like I'll
have some misconception or whatever and
he'll go off and be like well actually
it works this way I'm in this specific
state or whatever turns out that I got
an education for a reason and you
probably should have gone to school and
you know no I disagree with it for your
use case not for everybody really okay
you know what's funny is I actually had
lunch with a local content producer yeah
earlier this week like she she does like
this kind of vertically-integrated
content production for business
professionals okay that's like about
stocks and like business tips and like
that and apparently their program
actually airs among other things on one
of Fox's things like a fox business
thing
okay and then also unlike Air Canada
flight like a very old media yeah you
know like relationships with you know
national airlines and like yeah network
TV and anyway so she want to have lunch
I had no idea what she wanted basically
we did like a studio tour teryn I was
instructed by someone who works with her
doing some stuff over at BCIT and the
funny thing is Karen brought me into
their studio so that I could see how
like a proper company does things and
maybe we should have edits weeds and
maybe we should have death and maybe we
should have that and it turned out that
in much the same way as us they learned
as they went and there were a lot of
things they did better than us and there
are a lot of things we do better than
them so that was enlightening and then
do they do it at sweets they do have at
it too
that was what he wanted me to see what
he didn't want me to see with all the
other kind of janky stuff like the fact
that they literally have footage
archived on betas still whoa yeah but
remember broadcast TV that was a thing
but you'd think you'd move it a lot more
recently where you would actually
resubmitting finished projects by
mailing a beta mags okay or not a
Betamax sorry it's like they were two
different standards yeah like the the
broadcast tape version and like the one
that competed with eh anyway the point
the point is they still has like a shot
and this is after they cleaned up they
have like a shelf of betas and it's like
you're great and I was telling them
about the vault and stuff they're like
yeah that would be pretty cool and
Terran is like yeah that's pretty useful
maybe I don't have an editing suite but
I do have that anyway the point is she
asked me to have lunch with her and she
she didn't really tell me was about it
turned out she wanted me to talk some
sense into her son okay who had this
idea in his head that he was going to he
has two videos uploaded to YouTube in
you you probably get this all the time
too right could be like how do I be a
successful all wait you to burn
especially am I not to poet but I'm
going on my stream yeah especially on
your streams because like you have which
is hilarious because my stream sucks and
like nobody watches it and people ask me
how to be a successful streamer and like
you think I know I love about that
because I was going to crap on your
stream a little bit yeah I know it sir I
was gonna be like yeah like and your
streams not even bad or anything I'm
charity like but you have a lot more
success streaming than like you know how
it's like the first thousand subscribers
on YouTube is the hardest right you've
passed that first handful of amateur
subscribers ever took a further step and
owned it in the rest of the winter but
you clearly know enough to know laughing
that people would ask you about it
anyway so so usually when people ask
that question it starts with yeah I just
uploaded my first video or I just did my
first stream what would you recommend
and the guys like yeah so I want to do
like a like a fitness clothing line and
I want to do like a fitness lifestyle
vlog and
and uh and every waited way to compete
against everyone yeah yeah and it was
funny because his mom's giving me
additional details like yeah he wants me
to pay for plane tickets so he can like
travel interesting places for his
lifestyle on course and so I was like oh
yeah
all right bro one I'm not gonna side
with your mom and and just say the
straight up
stay in school could be a decent
strategy because I didn't don't worry
about it really
I mean she's got plane tickets go all
around the world okay you're going
somewhere else with that no totally not
anyway yeah I'm not siding with his mom
directly because like the whole school
thing didn't work out very well for me
but I was also like on the other hand
dude if you're going to succeed as a
social-media influencer you won't
succeed unless you have a the passion
and be the drive slash work ethic yeah
to do it on the side yeah so if you
don't have anything better to do then
stay in school but don't lose track of
that this should be your full-time side
project yeah and that was sort of the
advice that I gave and the guy like he
looked like I you know punched him in
the stomach
well then I was bigger than I am my big
I think oh my goodness thank you Nick
my biggest thing is like the Nason
should be paying me for this yeah I've
been drinking out of this bottle on wine
show for years yeah you can call it that
person who you call the super fun yeah
okay maybe I'll do that I don't think he
controls any budget spending there so it
won't do me any good but upside my suit
half the money
product placement okay you can never get
money for product placement if you have
product placement all over it up for
free anyway yeah people everyone looks
at and they just go why so why pepper
this you're going to do it I've never
done a successful straight up product
placement deal
I don't make sure we tried to do
something with a SmartWatch like with
pebble I think like a thousand years ago
and then pebble wouldn't even send us
review samples and then they got bought
yeah so that's about how successfully
visual yeah maybe they should have done
that marketing anyway um okay so my
thing especially a blur in his specific
position yeah were you like he's
uploaded two videos yes my whole thing
is like I don't care and you shouldn't
upload way more that's your big problem
right now is you just need to do it a
whole bunch yeah because there's going
to blending but you learn it doing it
doing it yeah yeah and from doing it
okay anyway like a you know
alright let's really enjoy
the Valero announcement when I thought
it was that LTX I'm actually getting a
lot more confident that this is going to
be a lot of fun yeah the case toss was
really fun we put we put actually we put
Colton's wife in charge of the event
yeah because previously we had Colton in
charge because they had such a wonderful
and well organized wedding and then we
found out that of course she had nothing
to do with it so we hired his wife and
she is doing a bang-up job so far there
is gonna be a lot of fun stuff to do
also fresh books yeah Brett box and UK
water blogs the core book now hold on a
second actually you know what I'll get
into it in the sponsor spot but that is
not as crazy as it sounds yeah that
whole thing that I just put on the
screen there ah ok so first first topic
you know what let's jump right into the
good stuff today the original article
here is from PC perspective and it was
posted on the forum by eek in and our
buddy
mister the one and only Ryan shroud
tastic
got his hand on an AMD Vega Frontier
Edition and how he did this I can tell
you he bought it the same as we had to
ours is in the mail
ok AMD is not sampling frontier edition
why might they not oh actually you know
what's really funny is I didn't even
read the article purchased directly from
a reseller rather than being sampled
from AMD so why didn't they want to
sample this to press well there are a
number of potential explanations for
that can you think of any will they've
been moving this way for a while ok
that's true online professional cards
yeah the fire fire class cards and
actually kind of both sides have been
living this way a little bit NVIDIA has
still been on their gaming cards have
been pushing really hard but AMD for a
little while now has been saying
they don't want to give out as many
reviewers sample cards because they want
to do more seating into the community
and NVIDIA did not sample the Titan xpp
yeah we have a video coming featuring it
soon but we borrowed it from somebody
and they're trying to line this card up
more against those that's true okay okay
I mean now I'm going to contribute a
potential reason potential reason number
two yields are very low and they don't
have a lot of them yeah okay so that
might be another one you got another one
I don't this is a thing mm-hmm but even
maybe everyone is buying every single
card everywhere for AMD right now ah
okay I'll totally like know that it will
sell immediately so price so rather than
giving away literally money in the bank
which one your AMD and like with their
press right now they might not even need
reviews of this thing because everyone
talking about AMD stuff is super popular
right now yeah and very positive right
now yeah so it's going to be popular in
positive anyways and then everyone's
buying it anyways because of mining so
they might not even need the marketing
that they would get from sending it okay
which brings us then to reason number
four which I actually think might be the
most likely Vega does not look like it
is going to set the world on fire and
AMD and for that matter I mean who
hasn't done this but AMD has
demonstrated in the past a lower level
of eagerness to seed products that they
don't think are going to be as exciting
in an attempt to if not limit
independent coverage of them at least
not spend money on getting independent
coverage of them so let's give a brief
outline of what it is so the Vega
founders Edition is not explicitly a new
gamers frontier editions I've done a lot
on the announcement with you like really
you guys I actually might have another
walk in the park coming on AMD's naming
schemes because I'm getting real set up
so the Vega friend here is almost sort
of copy everyone else yeah
not explicitly aimed at gamers like
Nvidia Titans we shouldn't expect the
best performance per dollar okay Gaming
results though and this is this is kind
of this kind of throws up some warning
flags because with gaming results
between a gtx 1070 and a 1080 priced at
$1,000 for the 300 watt version this
tells us a couple things number one is
that and that's the air-cooled one and
1500 dollars for the 375 watt
water-cooled one that tells us we are
pretty close to the the limit of what
this chip is capable of and there isn't
a lot of magic sauce we did a video kind
of covering this a little while ago was
a holy Shiite episode that we did where
we were like $6,000 graphics card we
game on it the amount of R&amp;amp;D that goes
into building a GPU is such that you
should be very surprised if there is a
specific product created for Quadro
versus GeForce yeah it's the same
product it's the same silicon and in
much the same way
AMD's frontier edition silicon will be
the same silicon
give or take it might be set up and
utilized or whatever in different ways
and the memory paired with it might be
different units here and yeah and logic
on board might be a little bit different
week here and there yeah but the amount
of money involved in building a GPU is
incredible so if you are expecting then
the gaming versions of Vega to come in
and crush the GTX 1010 80 let alone the
1080 Ti you are setting yourself up for
a major disappointment and I'm sure that
the AMD fans and twitch chat are
freaking out right now I'm specifically
not looking at it because I really don't
care I'm laying down some reality here
and that's the way it's going to be
there is some driver optimize a
to be done and AMD has been victorious
for this the 5870 is a perfect example
of a product that managed to get faster
enough through driver releases that when
they rebadged it it ended up being it
ended up not looking that bad when you
looked at launch reviews of the rebadged
one versus launch reviews that's the
original one but you can't expect more
than it's not going to double in speed
driver optimizations will give you a
little bit but the silicon is by and
large not going to change you know the
clock speed is by and large not going to
change because it's a 300 watt part at
999 AMD's closest thing to a competitor
is probably going to be somewhere in the
neighborhood of a gtx 1070 to 1080 in
terms of performance so AMD may not have
abandoned the high-end but it does look
like because they're not even talking
about like a high your end
yeah vega architecture product right now
not at all they do seem to have
abandoned whether by choice or whether
by strategy the enthusiasts of the very
extreme high-end I like using rise of
the Tomb Raider as a standard benchmark
regional scales really well CPU and GPU
yeah and and multi-gpu even and the Vega
EFI only managed to beat out the 1070 by
about a four to five percent lead which
is at that price like really not great
so it's not a gaming card no it's not
and we don't know anything about what
pricing of Vega gaming like ours what
are they gonna call it our 9 Vega or
something I don't I don't wanna call it
but a lot of times you can get a rough
idea of how it will perform and things
that aren't gaming by using games yes
they're not under they're not completely
unrelated yeah but with that said I
believe it is it FP 16 something there's
there's some more more
professional-grade features that make it
more comparable to Quadros than a
straight gaming yard would that
perform much better and may make Vega
frontier Edition very interesting for
workstation users because it will be
similar in terms of performance to AP
5000 Quadro but at about half the price
of that so at the very least if you if
you are wondering about buying like this
crazy tiered AMD card for gaming like
maybe don't maybe that's what we know so
far the very least like wait until the
gaming version of it arrives as you can
see kind of what were what we're dealing
with here even PC purse conclusion is
like title marked conclusion dotto dot
for now or something like yeah so like
yeah I don't think it's a huge deal um
yeah I mean looking into this card as a
gamers perspective but that's not what
it is no and it's not how its price yeah
I am shocked that they had the guts to
do a water-cooled card again like that
looked like a desperation tactic last
time the fury X was a commercial failure
other commercial failure and could you
buy I don't think you could buy a fury
ax air-cooled though right no so this is
a versioning thing yeah you have a
narrative is one there's this what were
you know Geary X again yeah yeah yeah oh
that's fair yeah we've got people in the
chat I'm finally I'm finally looking at
the chat i've decided to subject myself
to that age core 1 2 3 is like AMD fans
equal
Nvidia fans and there's some emoji I
can't see because it's too small and
yeah I recent Wars but I talked about
this a little bit on the last show to
the recent war has been kind of
interesting because everything that
people are fighting about are these like
outside of the tears of what they're
probably shopping for products it is not
funny so weird
the percentage of people that are
actually interested in buying $1,000
graphics card because if AMD can get
this price right then you know it yeah
it'll stomp all over 1060 but if it
consumes like 300 watts yeah I don't
know well you know what how about this
why don't we cross that bridge when we
get to it in the meantime that's what we
know for now also our Vega frontier
Edition is coming so we're going to run
all of our own numbers and make our own
video and you can probably save yourself
the trouble of watching it by reading
strout's reviews am I allowed to say
that yeah I mean who's gonna fire me
haha why did you fire her
dammit crap I'll have to go to my other
job yeah I'll have to go work work for
floatplane Club like you suck you yeah
would you hire me yeah yes yeah yeah I
would
you'd be pretty expensive but alright I
feel like that investment would pay
itself off so the original article for
our next news story is overclocked 3d
dotnet AMD announces their new rise in
pro series of desktop CPUs and I I got
to confess I was a little bit confused
initially by the announcement of rise
and Pro because I kind of went well what
makes a processor Pro other than being a
processor
nothing I get nothing for processor
sorry I'm replying to something I hate
you can use exact I can I pretend that
that laughs whatever my joke the best
part too is you made a joke and I didn't
laugh because I was answering a question
of someone going really Luke laughing
again everything's funny I'm just like
you know what I enjoy things and I find
things funny maybe we do when Shelley
alone at the end of the day on Friday so
we can kind of loosen up a little bit
hang out for the first time this week
because we almost never see each other
this week was pretty good
this week really really good it was of
yeah yeah yeah Daisy underscore HK yeah
I just enjoy laughing at things yeah you
know what laughter is the best medicine
I even got any mo therapy in which case
chemotherapy is probably the best medic
you might need to go do yeah so laughter
is the best medicine for if you're not
actually sick if you're not actually
okay anyway so I was sitting there going
what makes something a processor and
mine got him and my intro my initial
answer to that was the obvious one ECC
support okay yeah okay okay so you can
use server memory that has automatic
error Corrections that are going on the
fly in case there's like you know a
solar flare that flips a bit or whatever
and you you're you're freaking you know
freenas ZFS array gets corrupted
irreparably like that that's a pro-level
feature but the funny thing about that
is that Rison has ECC jokes they didn't
fuse it off the way that intel does on
all of their consumer chips even ones
that cost a thousand dollars which i
think is unreasonable because they're
worried about
they're worried about cannibalizing
their enterprise chips they're Zeon's so
what they do do though and this didn't
occur to me initially is they offer
Windows 10 Enterprise security support
AES 128 bit memory encryption and a
longer warranty with that set a 36 month
warranty is what they used to offer
anyway
hey okay I mean sure also a processors
whether it's AMD or Intel they're both
pretty good about their CPUs not just
like randomly fail every times if you
had a processor dying
I had an operon 165 die I deserved it
good your fault
I had it how do I put this
um yeah I'll hold on yeah no I didn't
like drop it on the floor but you like
over-voltage the bites are off of it
just can you just relax okay okay so I
had it chilled to minus 25 degrees okay
I'm not going to finish this all right
all right so it was not really the
processors if I had that coming
I'm not a yeah so zero so far yeah any
more um no I'm all towards zero so like
it's probably fine the pro series will
come okay now to be clear I have had
like a test bench chips die was that the
old school chiller yes a hole that's
pretty cool that's the chiller we
haven't thrown it away I might resurrect
it someday just for lulz you should do
that as a video it would be a great
actually it'd be a great deal how do you
really get Alice to help you with it
like yeah is it a little bit uh get it
in a cooler box than just proto case to
do something yeah yeah I like this
project that should be really sick and
then we could use it like on our test
benches and stuff I'll be really sick
we'd have to do up a new block for it
because the block I use for it was a
danger dent EDX and that was out of
period nest maybe you can follow up the
like terrible heatsink guides with like
a we professionally designed our own
heatsink terrible chiller guide I would
love personally I would love watching
them that would be great so I was
actually using and highly not
recommended so we're asking for the
story but keep it with antifreeze and
water as coolant because once you're
going down - no no sorry that's not what
you use you use a windshield the icer oh
that's actually like an alcohol-based
coolant yeah so I was using that at like
sub 25 degrees actually a little more
than that on the actual coolers about
sub 35 I was using that in there
philic block oh you restart no no I
didn't I didn't know that survived no no
I'm just saying that that block still
exists we still have it but it is so
good full micro-cracks yeah around the
fittings yeah that it is terrifying so I
was using it out of cheapness but has
assumed it would have corrected them
whatever block I used in this
contraption had to have like industrial
glue put on it so that I could put all
of my like neoprene insulation and crap
all over it and so it was basically a
write-off and that was at a time that so
a what you're supposed to use an
all-metal block yeah preferably all the
same metal yeah so that the expansion
contraction is of different metals yeah
yeah so preferably you're supposed to do
that but those back then I would have
been buying like a water cool I think it
was called the heat killer 3.0 or
something like that or whatever it would
have been at the time where those well
you were like 150 bucks all just silver
not you could get silver ones but even
the copper ones are like they were like
80 or 90 euro or something but we put
like that so so I was using like a crazy
dumb thing anyway if we if we use the
partnerships that I now have with like
proto case to do like a really nice
enclosure for it like get ek to build us
something like custom or something for
it that would be a sick project and
something that we could like pull out
with pride on the testbench when we want
play yeah no you know what because we
have more resources now there's more
writers and all that stuff something
that I would love for us to do is back
when it was just you and me we did some
factory juries yes we did arm Ron we did
Sennheiser we did I feel like there was
another one oh yeah we did cherry cherry
how do you forget area like much that
was where we Bluffs our factory tour
cherry yeah it was it was great I think
I think I missed it because Sennheiser
and cherry were on the same trip they
were yeah yeah but now going through
like maybe spending a couple days there
mm-hmm
and like going through each station
through like the design process of a
waterblock go through like the guy that
cads out the original files you know
what we
we tried to do ek oh we actually were
thinking about doing it on the same trip
as cherry and Sennheiser oh we couldn't
get it worked out because the budget
required for all the travel and because
we do charge for those that did a
sponsored type of project for us they
couldn't make that work at the time but
now that they're going a little bit more
mainstream and actually that might work
we'll talk a little bit more about that
when we do our ad spot for LAN show
today that ok spots maybe we could make
it work because I would love to be a
super cool bear shop is sick yeah and
like if you can actually see like what
goes into designing and building upon
our ek actually manufactures everything
so they're not like all water cooling
companies that are designing somewhere
and then outsourcing to China
yeah ek actually owns their own
manufacturing so it would be pretty cool
to see that every preacher ok well what
else do we got
ok raiven Pro um right we were talking
about ok risin Pro offers yet another
advantage over Intel's i3 series
especially because those lacks Intel
vPro so basically AMD is putting more
pressure on Intel and this time it's on
the like professional and business
feature side which is definitely
something that I can appreciate because
I mean you were talking about this the
other day the security and encryption is
going to become one of those things
where like we might be sitting in a
golden age of hardware right now where
manufacturers are waking up to the need
for encryption on their devices Apple
has to a great extent you know and
governments haven't outlawed it yet yeah
so think about this like ten years from
now getting your hands on a rise in Pro
might be like a thing yeah for your like
encrypted computer you want encrypted
memory yeah think about that for a
minute look I'm not trying to go all
tinfoil hat but it's no secret
governments around the world there's
articles in this way and show that we
haven't talked about yet that are
exactly in line with this
yeah it's going to be going to be an
interesting time
AMD accidentally reveals rise in three
details wah wah quote-unquote
accidentally or is this legitimately
accident I can never tell with those
guys to be honest with you sometimes I
suspect that it's quote-unquote
accidentally other times I believe them
that it's not accident I don't know
anyway
originally posted by Ryan Smith over at
Anand check well D if you were paying
close attention to this morning's
announcement of Andy's new rising prose
cues and you likely notice something
interesting the non ex pro chips all
have the same performance specifications
out there standard consumer counterparts
specifically both of the non ex Pro SKUs
with existing Verizon 5 and 7
counterparts have the same core counts
Fox News and DT DS as for the final two
rise in pro three SKUs well they
inadvertently showed their hands when it
comes to the forthcoming rise in three
okay so I mean we are making some
assumptions here but it looks like
they've inadvertently revealed the rise
in three thirteen hundred and twelve
hundred specs so the rise in three looks
like it'll be a quad-core CPU without
SMT so that's four threads rather than
eight which in my opinion is what
entry-level chips should have been at
this point for a few years now uh give
me one quick second sorry you're good
time is everything okay does everything
seem okay to you guys tell you what why
don't we talk about Rison three later
why don't I just do the sponsor spots so
boom fresh box alright I have I have
notes I always go off script and I
always get in trouble so fresh books is
be super simple to use invoicing tool
that actually does a lot more than just
help you create and send slick-looking
invoices you can keep track of your time
with their timesheet function manage
your expenses and keep track of who owes
you money even going as far as to be
able to tell you once your client has
looked at your invoice for the first
time what's really neat is their mobile
app has all the functionality of the
desktop version so you can take fresh
books with you
wherever you go and if you have any
questions about fresh books or how to
use it you can reach out to their
support staff where you literally call
them and someone like a person picks up
the phone is like hello no one is
available to take your call please leave
it no I'm just kidding not that other
part they pick up the phone and they say
hello and you can actually talk to them
no escalations phone trees return calls
just answers so visit fresh books comm
slash when if you're a small business
owner or you or a freelancer and you
want to start spending your time working
instead of spending your time working
out how to use complicated accounting
software also fresh books is our title
sponsor for LTX yeah Linus tech Expo
2017 where you can see this oh I wasn't
going to acknowledge it everyone's been
talking about it and the chat and I was
just going to completely oh no just you
are also here oh yeah fine we'll
acknowledge it
so that'll be there but I'm not going to
tell you any more about it other than
that that might be a line of tech tips
logo there yeah yeah it's all Will Smith
that's all we'll say about it so that
will be there we're probably hopefully
going to have okay I'm kind of testing
my hand a little bit here but LTX is
going to be freaking sick you're going
to have 16 K gaming there oh the case
Sasuke I don't know it's on full plane
right now
yeah it's cation pronoun no explode
plane oh yeah it's not on Channel super
on youtube but we did like a case toss
too so show what it might be like while
you're at LP yeah it's actually tons of
fun yep
there's going to be other examples of
Boots's there's going to be other types
of booths like guess how many CPUs are
in a jar kind of like the old jelly bean
thing rocket League in real life video
editing tips from Taryn yeah we're
literally going to take his workstation
and like Transplant it over there yeah
just let him keep working yep and he'll
be like talking to people about what
he's doing so it's July 29th from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. and you can get your
ticket through the forum or at the link
in the video description which I'm going
to go ahead and drop in the twitch chat
right now twitch plays Pokemon
was like we just skipping 8-k yes yes
okay other sponsor EK water blocks hekia
so this my friends is EK foray into the
mainstream but unlike their previous
predator lineup of thank you trying to
make water cooling more mainstream like
trying to be more like an AI oh but
better like expandable this one is much
much less expensive what they've done
and this sounds crazy on first glance
but we actually have a review which by
the way we completed it's not uploaded
yet but we completed we evaluated this
thing before we did any sponsor spots
for it we have a review coming and it's
pretty positive this thing is really
good by making all the blocks out of
aluminum instead of copper they have
lowered the cost they have lowered the
machining time which inherently lowers
the cost they have retained the
expandability and they have retained
most of the performance of a full copper
custom loop the drawback is that you
can't mix eks a series products with
their normal products because there
would be a risk of galvanic corrosion I
don't know why series started taking off
there but the point is the a 120 the a
240 and the a 240 G especially
personally I don't think this is in my I
don't think this is in my sponsor notes
but especially the a 240 and the a 240 G
look like a fantastic value for a custom
liquid coolant VG does that mean
includes like graphics card it does it
includes a 1062 Titan XP founders
Edition compatible block cool
so looks pretty darn good and unlike
other a iOS it includes actual fittings
it includes tubing that you can change
up for something else it includes Vardar
fans so very good fans and it includes a
like
like a custom grade pump and then tube
reservoir combo nice yeah that's cool so
look in looking pretty good so you can
check that out over at GE GE ni dot us
/ek fluid gaming I'll drop that in the
twitch chat as well okay all right yeah
I know I got the notification from Tyler
that he was clearing the fridge out in
15 minutes oh I got it twenty one
minutes ago oh and he was going to throw
away your food which I like don't even
normally store food here cuz I just have
like Soylent which you don't throw out
which I have for like breakfast and
stuff but there's I had a bunch of food
here that my girlfriend cooked and she's
the least domestic person ever and
doesn't cook but she's very excited
about this stuff right now so if it all
got thrown out that would have been a
very bad light yeah that would have been
bad bad scene so I solved that good
everything's fine so you solved that by
fishing it out of the garbage can
putting it back in the container telling
her I think in in Tyler's regular style
he said 15 minutes and is probably like
half an hour okay but it just wasn't
done yet
okay we've got people asking why I'm
using an iPhone and be clear what I mean
by that is he gave people a grace period
not that he's delayed I'm using an
iPhone because I actually don't really
care right now between Android and iOS
and I had to give the shooters my s8
which I was using as my daily driver to
do comparative V roll against the 1 plus
5 and then I just haven't gotten around
to putting my sim back in the s8 I do
intend to go back to the s8 how do you
feel about the notifications they're
both awful in different ways okay
because I was like one thing that I
hated about iOS when I used it for a
fairly short period of time was the
notification yeah the problem is that
Samsung in the I think it was the
marshmallow update well LM new get a new
good update so Samsung even when you set
your privacy setting people the chat
right even when you set your privacy
settings to show your notifications on
your lock screen before you log in they
changed it so that Gmail notifications
don't show anymore
so I actually have to unlock the phone
like I can see I have Gmail notification
I can't see what they are
okay well you should have your phone
encrypted so it doesn't so what they are
anyways no I think yet no it's encrypted
but you should you should make it so
that it doesn't show it yeah yeah yeah
yeah I was like in the security should
should should should do better to the
point is I get too many notifications
for that yeah
to be perfectly frank with you if
certain emails come through you can get
super screwed yeah does it not show the
subject I chose subject line maybe the
first few words but there's not much
there's some emails I can you can get
screwed I don't get any like two-factor
emails though like that because I think
that's the kind you think mostly yeah no
yeah ok no ok um so so yeah it's really
frustrating and yeah so anyway I just
haven't put my sim back in the s8 yet
and I actually own two smartwatches
they both sit on my bedside table on
their chargers and whichever phone I
happen to be using I just grab either an
Android wear or an Apple watch Wow yep
because I just don't care anymore I am
actually pretty psyched for the you know
what here let's blow through rise and
three oh that's the opposite of first
world problem so it's just like first
world XS sorry I have a matching phone
for I have a matching watch my phone
it's perfect all the time
you know what it's not that different
from people who have watches for their
outfits in fact it's very different I
only need one wire article that is not
more practical know your way oh I was
admitting a minor amount of defeat yeah
so anyway AMD accidentally real survives
in three details its quad core without
SMT it'll use the same guys rise and
five rises up a lot surprising I just
don't get paid enough even if I did I
wouldn't do more cores distributed over
to CC X's but we saw that that wasn't a
huge deal with the lower engine 5 same
caste structures rather than 5 1400
developed EQ blabbity blah blah blah TDP
will still just be the same 65 watt but
as we know the TDP ratings for CPUs like
Intel rates all of their
Armel SEC 8 PDT yeah it's like 130 watts
yeah clearly the ones with twice as many
cores clearly consume more power yeah
clearly so there's that big blanket
statement whole areas um yeah I had
wanted to chat about oh yeah you know
what well do you want to do this first
or that why do we do that let's do that
okay okay I realized what we're saying
right now is very cryptic but this is
important
if you are not already on floatplane
this is the week we'll other than like a
scrap good worse because unlike
scrapyard wars where we have one piece
of content that like half of our
community cannot wait to watch we have
four pieces of content right now that
are behind the early access wall on
floatplane that are freaking unreal
but they'll all be coming sometime in
the next week since I've read all of
them and I don't normally watch our
videos even that hot okay I hear about
everything going on and I'll like talk
to the writer that's working on it and
know their conclusions and loud day I'm
just saying
okay so LTT video exposing deadmau5
estudio spoilers he's a huge geek this
isn't even ltte video but these
cellphones actually cause cancer was an
entertaining tech working to make you
probably know the answer I kind of hope
but like it's a good thing to send to
people not everybody does or wouldn't
have made the video fair um ltte
unboxing a quantum computer that was
very cool I was awesome
so was the dead notes one those are both
really on ltte the most important iPad
video in years which actually got lost
in translation it's supposed to be the
most important iPad in years but that's
okay we'll figure that out also there's
a giraffe in the video which is why it's
has gone wild see we're all about yeah
faint that's true
yeah ltte although ultimate RGB build
guide yes
build guides are back in a real way just
okay okay this one lt's class
distinction you could do that I'm sorry
I didn't even know you could do it you
didn't know you could go that review
check out this intro this is very cool
yeah the best part is can you identify
all the people I can tell who some of
them are except for when they're running
by like I know names yeah that was very
obvious yeah I can identify everyone
except for when they're all running by
all the ones anyway then it gets missing
that's a great video
ltte can you Plasti Dip a whole PC
inside and out LPT unboxing Canada's
biggest supercomputer
yeah lgt can you Plasti Dip a whole PC
it's actually really funny so next week
is going to be ridiculous because many
of these projects for things that we've
been working on for weeks and or months
and they just all kind of came together
at the same time in fact if I was like
in charge of programming here I might
not have necessarily like I might have
tried to find other sort of I don't want
to say crappier stuff but yeah less
expensive content to produce to like
space things out a little bit but if you
guys want to join the floatplane club
basically the way to do it you've got
the link you posted in the chat room
okay good opt box got that now is kind
of the time to do it and yeah it's going
to be it's going to be a good time it's
going to be a good time over on
floatplane right now if you want to
binge watch all that stuff you're going
to eat you're going to like it um okay
so Apple moving on to news this was
supposed to by WM groom a K on the forum
and the original article is from
Engadget it looks like vivo vivo oh
that's what happened there what beats
Apple to an under display fingerprint
scanner but they say that the technology
still has a way to go I mean that's how
it sometimes is where people are like
yeah Apple never invented anything
whereas a lot of the time Apple doesn't
invent it they just kind of come along
and use it when when it's actually
mature enough yes we clear its
it's a qualcomm technology yeah so this
is an ultrasonic fingerprint solution
offering integration beneath OLED
displays up to one point two millimeters
thick like that's pretty big that's a
remote for an OLED as well as aluminum
even that's frickin cool that's pretty
clear like if the whole phone imagine
this if you could have like if you could
have like just to unlock your phone is
like easy like it's just one and then to
access your encrypted folder you have to
put like all five fingers on it or you
have to like can you imagine that I'll
be pretty cool so if you had like you
could have like the fingerprint down
here the little like all four fingers on
the back have to engage yeah I'll be
pretty neat I would love that it'd have
to be really accurate for that first gen
stuff not going to have that but that's
the kind of stuff I'd love to see in the
future apparently it works even when the
device is immersed in water just a huge
problem with existing fingerprint
sensors and it's already fair not
because you're like swimming with your
phone all the time
but like if it's raining or something
like that it's a little bit wet again
really annoying or like if you sweat as
much as I do
I mean like sports not just in general
eight or not I'm not sweaty right now I
mean I touched your shirt so I could be
as sweaty as you know yeah he's good
scientific test very scientific a oh I
have problems really awkward I have
problems with fingerprint scanners
though because I have as you know
annoyingly sweaty hands you're not
nearly as bad as when I met you
yeah when I met you it was like people
on hyperhidrosis it has gotten a little
bit better um I would go out of my way
to like not touch him like when I shook
hands at his interview I was just like
well can I hire this guy I also used to
like like if I went on it let's get
personal here for a second if I went on
a date with someone I would like avoid
that you would avoid hand-holding so
yeah just straight grab her by the I do
like arm over or
I don't go no I don't go Trump's about
with that but I try to go like arm over
shoulders or like like something I would
even do the like joking arm and arm
we're being funny old school thing Wow
that's Cranston well I would do it as a
joke to be clear but I would do that for
like a couple seconds to try to show
like I'm not being standoffish but also
I'm going to do this as a joke and then
stop because I don't want to hold your
hand Wow
because I was like yeah it's pretty
gnarly it's it's it's mostly fine now
okay um
karate one so anyway vivos x-play six
demonstrated the technology the demo
started off with a fingerprint
registration process that requested blah
blah blah etc etc then the user would be
able to unlock the phone by touching the
spot where they did the setup process or
somewhere else
so fingerprint recognition speed and
this implementation is slower than the
near instantaneous unlock we expect from
normal fingerprint scanners about a
second between the first touch and
entering the home screen but they said
the same TAC could be applied across the
entire screen oh wait now hold on
fingerprint was oh yeah
so they touched a different area just
above the old fingerprint button so
instead they might eventually cover just
the bottom half of the screen rather
than the whole screen um to save cost
and yeah same tax shown on the back of
the phone's body allowing it to be
unlocked even when placed in water
pretty I like that well yeah I really
like I very much like the fingerprint
unlock on the back of the pixel I mean
each fan of that um we're going into
this yeah I don't know should we or just
boring I want to talk about a theory of
mining is a really quick one but I was
posted on futurism and the original post
on the forum was ginger 1:37 up and the
headline kind of says it all is not not
a whole lot more to say at this point if
cerium could be using more than an
entire country's worth of electricity
now of course we don't mean like China
or the u.s. or whatever oh hi guys but
um I think the the country that we were
talking about was that it's a small
country
cypress so a bit more than what's
consumed by the island of Cyprus so 4.2
terawatt-hours Wow that's pretty insane
so one major reason for this is the
power-hungry graphics cards that are
involved but this might not be the case
for long if your iam has plans to move
away from its existing energy intensive
mining algorithms so there you can under
what that means for people's hardware if
it's just an algorithm thing like will
that rebalance what is better at it it
means a lot of cheap 580 s on the on
eBay
hopefully because honestly I was talking
to someone the other day buying a
computer right now kind of sucks
holy crap it's a great time to buy a CPU
yeah okay but on the counter argument
and people are going to hate me for this
but it's kind of rough to get into PC
gaming right now and I actually see a
lot of people going like Kay well the
graphics card that I want is going to
cost more than the freakin console yep
and like it's hard to justify yep it's
genuinely a little bit hard to just find
it because the graphics cards are so
expensive and if I'm a MD I certainly
want to sell graphics cards for as much
as I can of course why not or Nvidia for
that matter although NVIDIA has been a
little less popular on the Jolla period
mining side of things and like I've seen
some stuff where people are trying to
snipe out stores because certain stores
aren't increased kinda prices because
they're just trying to go for MSRP and
ram2 there's a worldwide DRAM shortage
that's expected to last well into next
year it's great for companies like
Coursera because it's hilarious like Ram
makers like Corsair in Kingston where
they they buy modules and then sell them
it's great for them because as much as
it's frustrating for them to not be able
to get as much allocation if they'd like
to sell their margin on a product like
that is kind of set because there's a
lot of competitors out there and
everybody's kind of in that 7 to 12
percent range pretty much give or take
but even though they're selling less
what they do sell hits their hits their
revenue numbers a lot harder so they're
doing more
you and making 10% let's say on a $50
transaction versus making 10% on a $100
transaction having to do all the same
fixed cost things so transport
processing fee marketing transportation
marketing packaging yeah hey that's
great for them speaking of the memory
business our IP Lexar memory cards this
was posted by shudder boy on the forum
the original article here is from petaa
pixel but crucial I don't know if you
guys know this but micron parent company
of crucial and Lexar micron just kind of
went yeah you know what compared to the
lucrative business of selling flash to
companies like Amazon and Google selling
like SD cards is a fool's errand due to
those low margins and low volumes all
that packaging and all that marketing
involved in what this tiny transaction
this is stupid so they're just like
forget it and they are shutting down
their removable storage retail business
I hope they don't shut down crucial
because their Facebook page is hilarious
other products that are being killed off
include USB flash drives memory card
readers and storage trailers which
honestly I'm kind of not stoked on
because the only pro-grade card readers
that we could find yeah are those Lexar
ones that we're using are in jealous of
you I'm not even kidding we we might
even do that yeah although I did run
into someone at Computex that's making
something that looks really Pro and that
has SSD and read Meg versions as well
they're like rackmount and yeah and
they're modular so I'll look into those
they run off Thunderbolt 2 and our
ingest stations are Thunderbolt that's
produced so we'll see yeah but if that
doesn't pan out or if that product sucks
Lexx ours all has kind of got but the
decision was made as part of the
company's ongoing efforts to focus on
its increasing opportunities and higher
value markets and channels so it
basically like lacks our products suck
it
they are exploring opportunities to sell
all or part of the Lexar business but
what that means is basically that Lexar
won't be Lexar yeah in much the same way
that the Sharpe is trying to get their
brand back in North America because
they're actually suing over Hisense
I'd leave it I sense I'm going to double
check before I like this large a brand
sharp high sense lawsuit I think yeah
yeah Sharpe saying that high senses
shoddily manufactured TVs are hurting
their brand image well you know they
were the ones who sold the business unit
to high sets they sold it can they do
anything about that I don't know but it
explains you know how we go to CES and
we're like what the heck is - yes yeah
why are they even here yeah now I
finally get it yeah um what else else we
got for this week there's another time
there's that weird Canada thing which
might affect other people so I don't
know we might want to talk about that
there's the tech powerup thing I'm
wondering on your opinion on that
actually okay I'm sorry I really haven't
looked into oh and there's digits
there's not a ton to look into it you
can look into it okay really quick so no
I'm sure I start on it she having not
read it yeah I was posted on the forum
by eyes can't see over 24 FPS and that
was the only way we're going to get me
to say those words altogether in that
order very very funny you know that's
going to get closed eye Gant ik troll
like really tightly clipped I know and
the original article here is from
deleted text comm which I've actually
never heard of what does deleted techcom
I don't know wow this looks like a very
small site and I'm not hating or
anything but basically the controversy
is over a tech powerup article that
appeared to be an article anyway that
was a comparison between AMD's Radeon RX
5 60 and Nvidia's GTX 1050 but that was
actually an AMD ad the article reads
like a review with no disclaimers within
the article itself that it comes from
AMD or sponsored by AMD the only ad Mar
occurs on the page were advertorial by
AMD off to the side on the top right and
the author being named
advertorial the article was posted
directly in the review section of the
site our forum members apparently
disagree as to whether or not AMD
crossed the line I don't know why it
wasn't linked but here's the actual
thing okay so let's call it let's pull
up the article here this does look like
an article so they're sponsored right
there yeah ad referral by AMD okay this
might be looks like it's been updated a
little bit might be updated huh when I
first saw this I didn't check for each
individual location but when I first saw
this I was not oh it has sponsored right
there content by nd okay okay it looks
like a few things have been added ha
interesting so did they ride around very
much in its current state what do you
what do you think about the transparency
okay so its current state the deleted
text site doesn't seem to have time oh I
think there's a picture on there
actually so yeah advertorial by AMD
above the here let's go let's go over to
deleted text for a second here and show
what it used to look like move to my oh
no mine screwed yeah your jobs carried
up right now
sorry you're going to want to yeah yeah
okay so here's what it used to look like
the the writer was advertorial it didn't
say sponsored under the FASTA QA
sponsored under the logo here and it
said introduction as though it was an
introduction to something yeah but it
did say a Vittorio by MD over on the
right so it wasn't like impossible to
figure out what it was but I think the
word advertorial is a little misleading
because in my mind and advertorial okay
so it's like edutainment right yeah it's
inherently educational entertaining
advertent tutorial and it's not a
tutorial this isn't a tutorial at all
here let's read it
we'll read it together it's not like how
to use AMD graphics cards advertorial by
him last year AMD introduced the first
polaris generation of GPUs with that AMD
delivered many new features along with
great performance in the latest games
and greatly improved efficiency like
that is not a tutorial be it eSports or
triple-a titles best value for the money
at around 100 euros consistently smooth
animation in popular games at 1080
formance pitfalls caused by running out
of video memory due to 4 gig models
being available ok none of that tutorial
for only around 100 euros the Radeon rx
560 outperforms the competition at this
price point while showing the
significant difference of upgrading from
a previous generation is this their own
benchmarks so that's honestly where
that's that's the one that I don't like
Radeon chill hold on with Ariane chill
saves power during games it does this
and these kinds of title
there is no tutorial Oh editorial not
tutorial editorial is it interesting
good call twitch chat ok I did not know
that I always thought that an
advertorial was an ad that was like how
to use it I thought it would would you
is what I think an advertorial should be
by the way because I have no problem
with that in fact that's something
neither I've been doing for years it's
like here's how to water cool your
computer so brought to you by some parts
that you can use to do that but but all
of these things I'm saying still apply
to other stuff an advertorial the like
proper definition is a newspaper or
magazine advertisements don't worry too
much about that giving information about
a product in the style of an editorial
or objective journalistic particle okay
so that's actually fairly transparent
okay alright fine
I don't like yeah so there's a couple
things here number one is I think
they're going to need to change really
just testing done by AMD in the last
paragraph yeah I think it should say
that on the chart
I think the testing shouldn't be done by
AMD that for one thing so even when we
do so we've actually done a here the
closest thing that we've done was uh but
okay guys the testing done by AMD should
be on the chart here this is the closest
thing we've done actually with AMD oh
I'm skippable ads we everyone's guru
they enable after a while so they're on
our our back catalogue oh yeah I'm doing
it no it's something that our MCN does
automatically yeah okay can you build a
4k gaming PC for under $1000 Oh
for some reason we're not looking at the
beginning of it so we say something
something something something something
AMD challenged us to do this blah blah
blah hold on here we go
is this the sponsored by AMD call-out
no I don't think so but this was this
was actually before some of those
guidelines came into place and we see
where else anyway I say it either two or
three times in the video verbally when
we get to the benchmarks because AMD's
argument to us for doing this piece was
that you can play popular eSports titles
at 60fps on they're affordable for at 4k
on they're affordable all AMD machine we
ran these benchmarks ourselves and we
told them we're not doing this video
unless we can validate this ourselves
yeah and that would have meant not
taking the budget that happened
letting AMD run their own benchmarks yes
I think strictly speaking that does make
it exactly as much of an advertorial
then as just an opinion but an editorial
again and maybe you can hear it want to
be my definition man for a second year
editorial my understanding means opinion
and facts graphs and charts are not
opinions a newspaper article written by
or on behalf of an editor that gives an
opinion on a topical issue so really
that's where the line gets crossed for
me because the disclosure is not quite
good enough it should be in the title
sponsored should be in the actual title
of the article
according to like FTC guidelines like
that actually needs to get done the all
of this stuff is quite a bit better now
ad referral by AMD
but in my opinion these graphs should
have either been run by techpowerup or
they shouldn't be here and it should
just be an opinion at the very least in
my opinion needs to be very clear on the
graphs of these are graphs from the
company and then personally that would
just make me not care and I'd move on
people are saying the graph serve as
evidence for the opinion of the author
but that's exactly it and it isn't
editorial then it's not an opinion you
can't say in my opinion this graphics
card runs faster when you actually have
that I mean it's the whole blurry line
between faction opinion these days but
once it's been quantitatively measured
in a way that is reproducible and
defensible and adheres to the scientific
method once it's quantified it isn't an
opinion anymore and a graph inherently
suggests that it has been quantified
people are saying but AMD is the author
that's fine but it still isn't an
editorial and therefore isn't an
advertorial so yeah huh okay I mean as
long as it's disclosed it's sort of up
to them and their relationship with
their viewers for our part we do do
sponsored content we've done sponsored
content for years we say when it's
sponsored content I would love to say
that we've never used anyone's numbers
we've shown slides with a manufacturer's
numbers generally speaking that would be
before we get an opportunity to show our
own numbers like at a launch event or
when it's being first unveiled at CES
for example yeah but then it's usually
clearly stated that that's their numbers
but it's clearly stated that anyone
else's numbers not quite but probably
almost every time that I've done that
I've been like but we'll have to see
when we can get it back into the office
for testing of our own so I mean with
over 3,000 videos uploaded I don't want
to say we've never shot anybody else's
numbers yep
generally speaking that's where we draw
our line clear disclosure and running
our own validation against the claims of
the manufacturer yeah in this case I
can't speak to their due diligence
behind the scenes except to say that
this graph doesn't look like it was
produced by them it looks like it was
produced by AMD for all I know they ran
the numbers but I don't like those
performance by in two years oh you know
that's ready to dive down at the very
bottom you testing done by AMD
performance labs March 1st 2017 using a
core i7 6700 K
oh boy um yeah so I'm not going to say
look sponsored content shouldn't exist
I'm just going to say it needs to be
clearly disclosed and for me personally
I'm very careful about any claims that
are made in our publication that I
couldn't stand behind whether I was the
one who ran the numbers or whether it
was my idea or whether it was someone
else's idea even in sponsored content
and it's up to techpowerup
to manage their relationship with their
audience and their trust with their
audience in terms of how they want to
proceed with this there yeah it's
interesting one more topic um I'm kind
of done okay yeah that's boring that's
boring okay this is kind of cool pet
yeah yeah coaxial gamer posted this on
the forum original article from
overclocked 3d net toshiba produces the
world's first four bit per cell so
that's qlc NAND flash memory so the
endurance on this stuff will suck like
we're talking a handful of write cycles
compared to what SLC would have been
capable of if it still existed but great
for write once read many many times
kinds of applications because it will be
really cheap so we're talking capacities
of up to 96 gigabytes of storage per die
allowing Toshiba to create a 1.5
terabyte SSD package with a 16 die
stacked architecture so they're going to
demo it at the 2017 flash summit in
August hmm there's X 299 boards bad vrm
cooling oh yeah that's a big sort of
thing I think we did tease that so yeah
we should probably talk about I've seen
this guys videos before I think you
pronounced the channel do Bower yeah
about right yeah yes I good videos
actually but serve hours posted a video
showing the VRMs on an X 299 board we're
reaching one
degrees and the single 8-pin connectors
for the power supply can hit sixty
degrees when overclocking the ten core
models here's to our good guy pro
overclocker actually makes the der bauer
D living tool which he gave us one of
its pretty pretty sick and he has some
serious concerns about X 299 and how
much time the motherboard manufacturers
had to work on their designs to make
sure that they were cooled correctly and
not just that but if you're interested
in that kind of stuff go watch this
video he does good stuff but given that
the motherboard manufacturers also got
blindsided by any CPUs with a core count
over 12 it's not just a matter of being
rushed but also a matter of not having
enough information potentially to design
a board that is actually capable of
handling this to be very he was testing
with one of the 10 yes the 10 core
yes but yeah so you can still it can't
get any better it can only get worse
yeah it's sort of a point yeah okay
there's one more topic we can gloss over
it a little bit but I'd also want to
give some people information on it
someone if there were no oh just Petya
ransomware okay I do really want to give
a call-out for the guy on the forum that
post of this thread WM groom a Kay has
done a very very good job of keeping
this up to date with really good article
linking really good quoting really good
updates condensing big updates on other
sites down into the easy digestible
things so if you're interested in the
world of viruses and hacking and
ransomware and and wipers and everything
else definitely go check out this thread
I just post it in the chasm and there's
a lot of crazy information in there
there's a bit of a developing story yeah
so you can maybe if we cover this now
and someone watches the show in three
days it's not going to be updated all
our notes are wrong and not because
James is a bad person but because it has
literally all changed it's been changed
he made his notes so so go check out
that thread it's being updated like it
was last updated like slightly over an
or ago yeah like after the show was even
supposed to start technically before the
show started but yeah it's it's parading
as ransomware it's actually a wiper
apparently the email account has been
closed by the email hosting services I
was hosting it so even if you try to pay
to get your thing back they can't
receive the email so they're not going
to be able to give you a key to unlock
your device like it's it's it's a mess
right now and if you're really
interested in that stuff I would check
out that thread it's it's very well
today
all right even includes like the Bitcoin
wallet address that people are sending
money to so you can see like how much
money they've made so far and everything
like it yeah that's good all right so
thanks for watching guys and we will see
you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel
well pal fans down you're like out out
right okay
Wendall's
okay it doesn't matter than that I'm not
trying to hide it Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
