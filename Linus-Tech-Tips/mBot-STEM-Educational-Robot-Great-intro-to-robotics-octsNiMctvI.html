group signed up for CES 2014 I've
received hundreds perhaps thousands of
spammy promotional emails it's mostly
nonsense and garbage products and I've
been clearing it out as usual when one
of them finally caught my eye meet the M
bot a $49 stem educational robot for
children I've been interested in
robotics ever since I was a kid so let's
find out if the M bot can live up to its
promise of one robot per child
first things first $49 is just the
Kickstarter price if you want an invite
to day it'll cost you $79 that doesn't
include shipping and on top of that I
had to pay DHL $20 in import fees from
Taiwan and I'm not the only one anyway
let's take a look at what we get in the
box
there's the MCOR microchip which is the
brain of the robot ultrasonic and light
sensors a bluetooth module if you have
the bluetooth version two gears that
will be used as wheels two motors to
power the wheels a little ball wheel
battery pack a single piece aluminum
chassis and IR remote with no included
battery a testing mat a motor shaft
repair kit an instructional booklet a
screwdriver and some screws bolts and
cables assembly is supposed to take ten
easy minutes but it took me longer for a
couple of reasons
like why are the instructions supposed
to be read clockwise also the included
screwdriver is only compatible with one
type of screw there's no easy way to
tighten the bolts and the instructions
fail to mention that there's a hex
wrench on the other side of the
screwdriver bit once the MCOR microchip
has been screwed on detaching the
velcroed on battery pack and managing
cables is quite difficult since there's
not much room also one of the wires on
one of my motors was completely detached
this was an easy fix for me but I did
some research and it turns out the
Quality Assurance on the motors in
particular has been a problem for make
block before anyway with the robot
assembled it's finally time to download
and install the in block software but
first you have to manually install Adobe
AIR if you don't have it already then
you can install the end block software
but according to the video instructions
before I can get to programming there's
still more I need to do first I need to
select the unbought board then select
the embody extension then you have to
select comm 28 as the serial port I
looked everywhere for comm 28 until
realizing that it's referring to a USB
port and com4 works just as well and
then you have to update the firmware and
after that you still have to download
install and link arduino drivers until
finally you can start uploading code to
the in bot that's a lot of steps to go
through before you've even started
programming sure it all seems obvious
once you know what to do but the mbot is
supposed to be
starter robot for children kids and
lines Media Group employees he'd very
clear comprehensive instructions with as
few steps and as little frustration as
possible anyway I finally got to
programming with the unblock software
now this is actually a modified version
of scratch which was developed by MIT to
teach kids about programming scratch is
pretty cool and it reminds me of when I
was a kid learning programming with game
maker v the Scratch programming
automatically converts itself into
Arduino code which is ready to be
uploaded onto the M pot I think that's
pretty cool since it makes it easy to
see exactly what the graphical Scratch
programming looks like in real
text-based code anyway I went through
all the videos and programmed the
ambadas instructed and I tried a bunch
of my own programming programming mbot
is mostly straightforward but only when
it works more on that later the video
tutorials give you a few ideas of what
the M bot can do but I ran out of
tutorials quickly and I found myself
thinking is that all the most
interesting things you can do in no
particular order our follow a line
crudely avoid obstacles and remote
control the M bot with the remote or
bluetooth you can also make colored LEDs
flash and make noise with the buzzer but
you don't really need a robot for that
and you can detect the ambient
brightness of the room with the included
light sensor on the M core but I don't
really see the point and even the
Associated tutorial doesn't do anything
with it except display the value on
screen I feel like it would have been
better to use this in place of the
current two bottom mounted line
following light sensors which can only
detect black or white meaning that it
only has four states zero one two and
three this makes smooth PID line
following impossible also I don't see
that there's any way to do more than one
thing at a time like flashing LEDs while
simultaneously line following two
different things which shouldn't
interfere but they do it all gets lumped
together this is because of the decision
to base the M bot on Arduino which
doesn't support multi-threading bummer
I mean maybe this is all just an issue
of expectation management the
Kickstarter campaign really had me
excited for the M bot but you need
additional hardware to do some of the
cool things they show
the stock mbot only assembles in one way
and it comes with just two motors for
the two wheels though the rj25 ports can
support more motors if you want extra
sensors or a robotic arm for your mbot
you'll have to buy those this is par for
the course when it comes to robotics but
because of the mbot single piece
aluminum chassis it's not nearly as
modular as other robotics kits this may
be a good or a bad thing depending upon
what you want the M bought for the
hardware is fine it's the M block
software that has issues it was
frustrating to install and even more
frustrating to use sometimes the M bot
wouldn't be detected and sometimes it
wouldn't accept code and here's a
strange problem it seems like after you
upload your first Arduino code to the M
bot certain scratch script modules no
longer work even though they previously
did work as shown in the video tutorials
also at some point I lost the ability to
upload code from my work computer
completely I kept getting this error
also I could never get the ultrasonic
sensor to work no matter what computer I
used I kept getting the error undefined
reference to count pulse ASM I told make
block about my software problems and
they quickly updated the software now
the ultrasonic sensor works and I can
upload code from my work computer again
that's great
but then all my LED programming became
non-functional and I had to redo it
there are still other issues with the
software I sincerely hope that these
remaining problems can also be resolved
if they are the M BOTS could be a
worthwhile purchase overall I spent more
time trying to get the M bot to work
than I did actually programming and
using it now there's a graphic on the
Kickstarter page favorably comparing the
M bought to three other competing
robotic systems at first glance it looks
like the M bot is clearly superior then
you look a little closer and realize
wait a minute and RGB LED isn't a sensor
neither is a buzzer and these other
robots are poorly represented for
example the Lego Mindstorms educational
base set has a ton of stuff not listed
in this graphic there's a touch sensor
lots of gears wheels and beams and
integrated display with buttons a
speaker and enclosed PCP and three servo
motors with built in tachometers for a
total of nearly 500 parts with nearly
unlimited ways to assemble it all of
course it's a more expensive $250 and
this came out a
years ago the parallax Arduino shield
seemed like a much more fair comparison
and it certainly looks like the mbot has
much better hardware for less money but
I can't say for sure since I've never
used the parallax Arduino shield robot
kit I've also never used the vex IQ
robot but hey vex parallax Lego tetrax
if you guys want to send any of your
robots to us for a review go right ahead
I'll review it get in here so anyway
here's the question if the M BOTS really
was $50 total and of all the problems
with the software were resolved would
the M bot be a worthwhile purchase sure
at that point the only issue I can see
is that any kid who's really interested
in robotics is going to quickly outgrow
the M bot because of its limited
hardware and singular method of
construction that makes a product like
the M bot more appropriate for
educational settings where kids can
learn everything they can from it and
then move on to bigger and better things
allowing the next group of kids to have
their turn it's not necessary for every
single child to own an M bot since every
kid is not going to care about robotics
so if you or your child or your class is
interested in robotics I cannot
recommend the M bot there are plenty of
more well established brands for you to
choose from like vex robotics
tetrax Mindstorms and so on I recommend
that you spend the extra money and get a
robotics kit that will allow a much
greater range of learning and
experimentation and on the subject of
fixing things and putting stuff together
today's episode sponsor is iFixit you've
probably used or at least read one of
the thousands of in-depth tear downs or
guides available on their site but what
you might not know is that they also
have a great line of professional
electronics tools the crown jewel of
their lineup is the pro Tech tool kit
which I use quite a bit and Linus gets
pretty annoyed when I misplace it it's
got over 70 tools including a 54 bit
driver kit nylon and metal sputters
sputters booters an anti-static wrist
strap and lots more
whether you're fixing a handheld system
like a 3d S or shield or trying to
disassemble a gaming monitor like Linus
did in this video or if you just want to
improve your PC building experience with
a better set of tools the pro Tech tool
kit is a great choice it's available for
only $64.95 from iFixit but if you
our offer code Linus tech you can save
$10 on any purchase of $50 or more so
head on over to our link that's
ifixit.com slash Linus and save on some
awesome tools today so what do you guys
think was I too hard on the mbot do you
have one and if so what do you think
about it are you guys interested in
seeing more videos about robotics in the
future and how do you feel about me
Tarrant as a host hello by the way if
you haven't seen me before let us know
in the comments anyway time for Linus's
new outro if this video sucked do you
