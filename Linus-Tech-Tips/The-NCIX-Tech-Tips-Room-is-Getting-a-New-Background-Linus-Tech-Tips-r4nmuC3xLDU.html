tech tips room but it's not one that I
guess I'm directly involved in I mean
I'm involved but I'm not I'm not the one
actually doing it we are finally getting
a new background for NCIX
tech tip so my NCIX comm channel this is
a rough mock-ups sketch from the Vandal
or a graffiti artist that has has been
kind enough to help us with this project
so you can see we've made a little bit
of progress on the wall it's going to be
a mostly gray background we're going for
kind of like a more modern style because
before we just had like a blue wall and
so now we want something that looks kind
of kind of more stylized and cooler so
this is going to be an NCIX
sort of logo here once you remove the
painters tape and and once he does all
of the whatever is that painters view
and then up here we're going to have
like a tek-tips logo and I just wanted
to do a couple in-progress shots so that
our viewers could sort of follow what's
going on and hopefully we're going to be
able to actually shoot it in front of
this in the next week or two so I stay
tuned and we'll show you more updates as
they are made</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
