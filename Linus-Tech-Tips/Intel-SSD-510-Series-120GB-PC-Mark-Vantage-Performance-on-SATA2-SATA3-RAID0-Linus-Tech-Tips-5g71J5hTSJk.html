video for you guys this is featuring the
intel SSD 510 series SSD anyway I ran
some pcmark vantage benchmarks on these
particular SSDs I actually ran them with
an intel p67 motherboard so I've got a
few different configurations to show you
first of all I ran single Drive on the
SE 236 gigabit per second controller as
well as on the say two to three gigabit
per second controller and the objective
of that was to demonstrate how much of a
performance advantage you get by pairing
this SSD up with a proper state of 36
gigabit per second controller versus
running it on an older legacy Seita to
controller I also ran the two drives
together in raid 0 again in both
configurations so on both different
speed controllers to see what kind of a
performance benefit we get from jumping
from one SSD 22 SSDs add just as a point
of comparison I compared the onboard
raid against an lsi 9268 I raid card
which i believe is configured optimally
but I'm not actually an expert at
configuring the raid bios oh I'm sure as
the community plays around with these
more they will find ways to eat more
performance out of it and also for
context I've compared these two SSDs
against an ocz revodrive x2 240 gig so
that's going to show us what force and
force drive so that is for 60 gigs and
force drives essentially in raid 0 will
be able to do against these all right so
you can come in close here and have a
look but basically i'll its logo will go
from by columns so the first column here
is our single drive performance and you
can see that we actually gained thirty
percent performance going from a SATA 2
3 gigabit per second connection to a say
236 gigabit per second connection now
when we actually go down to the hard
drive suite results we can see which
applications are really making use of
this extra bandwidth so there's certain
things that actually don't get nearly as
much benefit as others so when you're
talking small files okay so such as
adding music to windows media player
you're not going to see as huge a
performance
benefit as when you look at much bigger
files like say for example video editing
using Windows Movie Maker so basically
the larger the files are and the more
sequentially we're reading from them or
writing to them but more benefit we're
going to get from that wider interface
so as we move over here I'm just going
to bring these back up to show you guys
the total scores as we move over we find
our raid 0 results so you can see that
on the SATA 2 connection we actually get
more benefit from raid 0 vs on the sata
3 connection and I guess the reason for
that would be that what we're doing when
we add raid 0 is we are doubling the
amount of bandwidth available though
we're doubling the number of drives so
certain things are going to be less
bottlenecked and certain things are
going to be equally bottlenecked so
let's have a look at where the say 236
gigabit per second interface is really
able to pull away from the slower
interface and there aren't as many huge
examples of that but you look at video
editing again so that's where you're
looking at a huge performance benefit
from the wider interface ok this to
start up once again gets a lot of
benefit actually I'm going to scroll
down over here and let's see how much
vista start up yeah so that one actually
didn't improve much from the single
drive configuration mmm interesting ok
so let's move over let's have a look at
our raid card results so here we can see
that it actually doesn't score as high
as the onboard rate ok but some of the
results here are actually better so you
can see here Windows Defender actually
performed significantly better than the
onboard raid we're talking on the order
of about fifteen percent better so the
reason for that I would speculate based
on the crystal disk mark results that we
saw before is that the onboard the
onboard raid controller doesn't perform
as well as the dedicated raid controller
in random reads and writes gaming once
again the dedicated raid controller
absolutely blows away the onboard in
fact many of these results are
significantly better than the onboard
raid the only reason that we're seeing
this low overall score seems to be that
windows
media center doesn't perform nearly as
well on the dedicated raid card so
that's something to bear in mind when
you're looking at the overall results
where you see the onboard raid just
destroying allow you know a hundreds of
dollars dedicated raid controller so
let's move on down here to the revo
drive x2 once again we see a very low
overall score but as we move down and
try to hear you know I'm going to move
this one next to it or above it so that
we can have an easier point of
comparison so this is the revo drive x 2
this is 2 5 tens on the onboard raid
controller because that's sort of the
configuration i'd consider most likely
we see that don't mount okay that won't
fly okay we see that the revo drive x2
actually does outperform the duel 5 tens
in some applications but there are
others where it just gets demolished
such as the video editing benchmark
where yeah there's absolutely no
comparison but you look at some things
like application loading as well as the
antivirus test and it actually
outperforms it so that probably again
also reflects the better performance
that the revo drive x2 has in random ah
highly usage scenarios versus the dual
drive config so thank you for checking
out my pc mark comparison of the intel
SSD 510 against itself on a say 22
versus a SATA 3 interface as well as a
couple other points of reference for us
