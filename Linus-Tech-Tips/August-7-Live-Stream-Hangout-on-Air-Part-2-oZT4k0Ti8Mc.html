are we back of course there's no viewers
now because everyone is gone
you
are we back I have moved I am live again
excellent okay so I don't know what
caused that exactly but I am definitely
not using Google Hangouts on air anymore
I am back tweeting it and that'll
probably affect viewership over the next
little while here tonight let's get my
get everything all set up again so I'm
in my computer room now you can see I've
got a cat lounging up there I've tried
to put on some lights that might make
the may make the video quality somewhat
acceptable
I don't know what this is
apparently Firefox is oh no Firefox is
good okay all right we're back
are we back I think we're back let me
just sort of adjust the thing because
I'm sitting in a chair that's a
different height here and I like I don't
okay guys tell me something really quick
here is there is there any like is the
Liz the original livestream livestream
part one I guess I'll have to call it
now is that one still showing up
anywhere or is the default one when you
look at the channel livestream part two
let's check the video manager here that
over livestream a hangout on air yeah
okay okay so that remote you know I'm
not gonna be able to get away with doing
a half hour segment here because by the
time it's half an hour in we're gonna
have barely answered any questions ah
all right so let's get back to some
questions here shall we
where did we leave off live stream says
we'll be right back yep
yeah I broke Google I know okay
scrolling down some more she read my
comment
massive fangasm thank you Rana for that
stream is offline how did I get into
motorcycling you know what great
question Chris I started riding a bike
when I was very very young you know one
of these kinds no I'm just kidding it's
not I got into the middle my dad my dad
had a motorcycle just a little 250 cc
was like Nighthawk or something you know
what's great about this whole like
browser sharing thing is I can probably
actually find what bike he had and I can
show you guys so it was like it was a
honda nighthawk 250 I think so I didn't
write on the back this and oh right I
can't press that too because that'll
change my things so there we go at least
I hope that's working no yeah there we
go okay oops honda nighthawk 250 so
we'll search for that yeah okay let's
search for a red one though red and
images there we go so I used to ride on
the back of one of these little guys
with with my dad and you know that was
fun and so I decided at some point that
I wanted to get myself a bike so when I
you know grew up and moved out and got
my own money I bought myself in and
sv650
took some classes you know making sure I
actually know how to ride on one and
yeah I've been having oh I'm having a
blast with it I haven't actually I
haven't actually written it as much as I
would have liked this year but I've been
on it for this past week so it's been
great - why do gamers love quiet
computers and loud keyboards great
question because loud keyboards are a
necessary evil if you want that tactile
feedback when you're typing it makes you
faster and more accurate whereas loud
computers are just annoying or for me
personally it doesn't serve any kind of
functions so it doesn't really doesn't
really float my boat I should use Metro
twit as my desktop Twitter app you're
probably right I have so little
experience with Twitter still at this
point that I'm learning a lot all the
time so this is the best I can do right
now so you're just gonna have to live
with it
apparently I can barely keep my
livestream up so you should you guys
should be like you guys should be amazed
that I can even manage to show you a
Twitter feed because in the past I've
always just done this and just held
Twitter up to the screen and hope that
it'll like magically focus and you'll be
able to see stuff and hello show us your
cats I don't think I'm gonna be able to
cuz he's um well yeah actually no there
there that is my cat
that's rocket he's just sort of hanging
out on top of the bookshelf he loves it
up there alright kindly lower the
quality I can't stream that fast um dude
I don't I don't know what to tell you
like I don't mean I can barely figure
out how to get it working so I don't
think I can I don't think I can figure
out how to adjust quality okay so let's
go to some of the new questions and what
do I write today I'm still in the sv650
oh that won't work for me you are just
going to have to be banned forever if
there's a way to do that ah yes you are
blocked goodbye thank you for playing so
let's move down lioness do you prefer
Intel or AMD you know what Santiago
you're gonna have to check out my Intel
versus AMD video in fact if you search
on youtube for youtube.com/ Intel versus
AMD I believe I am actually the first
hit so there's no excuse for not having
searched for this oh no I'm not I'm hit
no no that's a featured video that
doesn't count but I'm I'm hit number hey
look I can I can point at stuff I'm hit
number two so if you watch that video
which has 400,000 views wow people care
about this then you will know that there
is no such thing as Intel versus AMD and
one of them is better than the other
comes down to each individual product
Sabretooth axe 79 does a coil line I
don't have a Sabretooth x79 so I haven't
actually tried it Wei Ming Zhou is it
possible to do a video comparing onboard
audio to a dedicated
did a lot just subjectively for myself
but unfortunately there's not much you
can do in terms of in terms of like
empirical benchmarks for audio quality
because so much of it is personal taste
so what I can tell you guys is that my
personal taste is to not use horrible
horrible onboard audio and if you want
to do it then that's fine but a
dedicated card is definitely better have
I tried out the g600 Mouse yet I have
actually so to give you guys some idea
what my impressions were like that is my
Akari laser and that is the g600 though
that is that's a Naga which I like as
well g600 I haven't tried installing the
drivers properly for it or anything yet
but my initial impression is that the
there's a there's some delay there's
some input lag that I'm really really
displeased with but I don't experience
with the Naga or with the Akari laser so
I'm gonna give it a chance once I've had
some time to install the drivers and
actually fire up a game with it I've had
so little time lately
yeah Damian what is the most scary
moment in your tech / computer career a
scary moment um I don't know it's hard
to say probably probably when I braked
really hard and I had it I had an entire
tray of OAM AMD processors unreleased
processors and I braked really hard and
it fell off the backseat down below and
about half a dozen of them 3 somewhere
between three and six of them ended up
with bent pins one of them was bent so
badly that I ended up breaking the pin
when I tried to use it and that was the
one I really needed for the tech tips
video I was doing so that's the that's
the origin of the legendary broken pins
camera man's epic grammar here fixing a
bent / broken pins pin but that's where
that episode came from because it was an
impromptu episode we did when I broke
the bent pin as I was trying to unbend
it and we ended we ended up being able
to fix it and that CPU is still running
to this day and my parents can
ughter so so there you go - sir I have a
Linux box - I have a Linux computer I do
not actually I'm a strictly Windows guy
ah
Dallin Ross how important is cast
latency and memory timings to gaming
performance it makes almost no
difference these days the general rule
of thumb is if you go from 9 9 9 27 down
to 888 24 that's about the same as going
from 1333 to 1600 and both of those
differences are very mine you so if you
go from like 1333 like cast 9 memory up
to like 1866 cast 9 memory you'll get
maybe a couple percent which will be
equivalent to like a third of a frame or
you know like one extra fps you're never
gonna notice the difference usually when
people ask me about memory my suggestion
to them is by the RAM that like looks
cool with your system because that's
about the only thing that that matters
these days unless you're really out
there trying to set performance records
and you're really into a benchmarking
and an overclocking your memory and all
that kind of jazz ah thinking the new
build would you recommend an i-5 35 70
km a gtx 660ti power Edition and a
biostar ok well you had me at the i-5
and the gtx 660 power Edition I'm a big
3 guy if it's not a soos gigabyte RMS I
am really not that interested so I would
go with anything from those three guys I
can't guys Dillon particularly Dillon
that's that's you I can't really answer
every question about a particular
configuration and I can't walk you like
I can't hold your hand through
overclocking over YouTube that's just
not gonna work or over a private
messages I have so many people message
me every day Linus I have this
configuration they send me like these
pager long YouTube private messages or
like here's my configuration here's all
the things I've tried can you walk me
through this I'm like no I'm sorry I
can't because if I walked everyone who
asked me through overclocking then that
would be all I would do all day every
day and I don't think anyone's going to
like feed my baby for doing that so it's
it's it's just not that realistic
however usually if you search for
overclocking guide if you search for
some kind of overclocking guide on
YouTube I will have some kind of a guide
up there so it might help a little bit
to to throw in the NCIX keyword there
you go AMD phenom 2 x6 overclocking
tutorial with 400,000 hits so Dillon you
got to find these videos as opposed to
sort of asking me on Twitter because
it's yeah I I could / help you overclock
140 characters at a time but it's not
that doable hmm wow that's really warm
in this room with all these lights and
computers I've got I've got my test
bench running with my with my seven
harddrive raid and 512 gig samsung 830
SSD as a cache running on an Adaptec
raid card I've got that going on in here
and that's producing some heat and then
I've got sorry I'm just gonna got my
wife's computer there then I've got my
computer there and I got this laptop
here and then I've got that light and
that light and that door that door needs
to remain pretty closed because there's
a baby sleeping on the other side of it
that's why I really wanted to do this 10
stairs in the kitchen but if he wakes up
then I guess I maybe he'll join us so
that'll be that'll be fun for everyone
for a computer to record music in what
is the thing I can cheap out on what is
the must for me well if you're going to
be doing any music edit like serious
like multitrack music editing you'll
need a decent processor you'll need a
decent amount of RAM you don't need a
video card pretty much make sure it's
quiet though because the worst thing in
the world is to be trying to do music
recording and you got fans going in the
background so yeah definitely spend
money on making sure it's really silent
our ducky shines good mechanical
keyboard
yes I haven't used one extensively
myself but slick swears by it and his
his opinion is pretty much all I need to
hear for most things he's he's very
knowledgeable haha you know what why
don't we have a look at some of the some
of the newer 161 new interactions
alright awesome
172 new interactions ok you guys are you
guys are you guys are killing me here
this is interesting
7/7 a wants to know what chair I would
suggest for sitting done for a long
period of time a comfortable one the
great thing about chairs is that they
are really easy to try before you buy so
you like you take your button you can
put it in the chair and you sort of
wiggle around a little bit you see if
it's compatible you know if there's like
a good you know surface contact between
the bum and the the chair cushions and I
mean come on now what do you want me to
say it's like there's like tech QA and
right like chairs I don't listen to Daft
Punk I don't have any computer
programming knowledge in fact I can
hardly I can hardly
like make things bold that I'm trying to
do merchandising on NCIX like what the
you know the little thing and like the B
in the middle and then like the /b sorry
guys I'm pretty much a strictly hardware
guy Julian did you ever think you'd be
doing what you do for a living if the
whole YouTube thing failed where do you
think you'd be now believe it or not I
don't do YouTube for a living so did I
ever think I'd be a product manager for
a living no that wasn't what I was
expecting I I was expecting to be a
sales guy and then I wasn't really sure
what would happen from there and so the
little product management thing really
fell fell into my lap and it's been it's
been good it's been good but no YouTube
is YouTube is not a real job actually
this is something that I wanted to talk
about a fair bit because I had someone
send me send me a private message on
YouTube about their attempts
they're trying to do like those gameplay
videos which honestly guys I mean if you
can enlighten me I really don't
understand the charm and the appeal of
this whole like I'm playing video games
and I'm rambling into my mic about like
whoa this thing blew up and like oh man
that reminds me of the time that I was
you know chasing my cat and it blew up
like I don't really understand so he's
doing these gameplay videos and he's he
sends me this message it was very it was
very heartfelt so I actually I read the
whole thing and I I watched a couple of
his videos and he's like dude I want to
do YouTube I want to do YouTube like
this this is my calling
and he's been at it for about five years
now and he's got over 4,000 subscribers
but I don't think many of them are that
active because new videos are only
getting about 30 views so for context
I've got around almost 200,000
subscribers and every video gets around
you know at least 30,000 views which
means a lot of that's coming from the
subscribed viewers so I'm just kind of
looking at this I'm going man what do
you want me to tell you because YouTube
is not a real job there's very few guys
out there who don't need a day job
anymore I mean if your name isn't philip
defranco ray william johnson some of
these some of these like game streaming
guys who are very popular and it really
can't figure it out you have a real job
or you're you know going to school or
you're you're doing something else you
have another plan youtube I mean YouTube
can go away as fast as it came I it's
it's a anyway I was kind of marveling
the other day YouTube started up in what
2004 that's eight years ago that's
nothing I mean if you're planning a
career like my wife's a pharmacist so
that that is a career YouTube YouTube is
not not a career I mean I do this
because it's fun I do this because I'd
like to educate people yeah I enjoy it I
love the hardware I mean I love playing
with you know the latest like cool stuff
and just kind of having it sitting there
you know getting like Linus edition Ram
that doesn't exist outside of the U six
sticks of it that I own and mean that
kind of stuff really gets me excited so
that's why I do it not because not
because it's a career and where do I
think I'd be now without YouTube why be
just product managing me and I wouldn't
have all of you funding people to talk
to you on my Friday night
it's funny because I was when I was when
I was figuring Hill when to went to
schedule these live streams on a weekly
basis I was like oh what night works I
was like oh you know Friday night should
be pretty good because at the end of the
work week you know I'm pretty tired you
know might be nice to just kind of hang
out say stream in front of the camera
for a bit and I didn't even occur to me
that you know people code on a Friday
night and the funny thing is you guys
apparently don't go out on a Friday
night either
although it's okay I'm just I'm just
messing with you because I'm sure a lot
of you are actually located you know
around the globe and it's not Friday
night it's like Saturday morning or
whatever else Oh someone wants me to
show the Linus RAM again this is the
Linus edition run it has a special color
scheme my understanding is this never
actually existed anywhere else yes I've
heard of the Raspberry Pi however I
haven't actually physically seen one yet
and I don't get too excited about
hardware that doesn't physically exist
yet because I've got way too many like
fascinating things that do exist that I
can I can focus on okay Curtis has a
question Curtis right there house rock
isn't part of the big three what's good
about their products you're right as
rock isn't part of the big three and you
will find no ass Rock motherboards
deployed in anything that I do I did try
out their extreme 11 just to find out if
it had coil line but as I've found so
many times in the past with anything but
I tear one motherboard there's some sort
of nagging thing that isn't gonna work
for me so on that one it was the loud
chipset fan and I had a lot of people
send me links to MCW 30s or other
generic chipset coolers and I appreciate
the help but believe it or not it did
occur to me I have an MC w-30 sitting in
that room over there see behind that
door it's not like I don't know what it
is
and MCW 30 won't help because there are
four chips under that heat safe for not
just one and MCW 30 is big enough to
cover one so there are 2 plx chips which
need to be actively cooled there is one
what's SAS controller from LSI that
probably needs to be actively cooled and
then there's the Southbridge so unless
there's a custom lock
happening can I recommend a headset for
around 50 to 150 US dollars that's quite
the range I would recommend the
SteelSeries 7h if you don't mind dealing
with the sort of fubar connector here if
you're willing to be careful with it
it's the best balance between comfort
and sound quality and price that's out
there pretty much if you want something
Wireless the Vengeance 2000s a very good
choice from Corsair if you don't want
something Wireless vengence 1300 is not
a bad bet either Big D wants to know -
why do you choose an iPhone / an Android
phone because I really really like iOS
it's like just it's like smooth even
jellybean even on the Nexus 7 with a
Tegra 3 processor is not quite there not
quite there Thomas just wants to know
how the cats are they're good there's
one Jack wants to know my thoughts on
EVGA stuff what do you want me to say
they're there in videos number one
partner in North America they stand
behind their products yeah what else is
there to say they have some products
that do have a lifetime warranty still
anything with AR and the part number
does have a lifetime warranty they have
other cool warranty perks that other
guys don't necessarily have so they have
a global warranty that is based on the
purchase date and serial number not
based on the invoice which means that
you can resell your EVGA card and they
will still honor the warranty on it
which is pretty cool not everyone does
that this is a good question down there
a lot of people ask me this should I run
two SSDs in raid zero or should I resell
my current one and buy a bigger SSD for
99.9% of people a single SSD it's gonna
be the solution you want I know I run a
des SDS in raid zero but I have almost
zero important data that I actually keep
on my computer like nothing so I'm not
worried about it
I do nightly backups and I run almost
everything directly off of my Windows
Home Server so raid does increase the
chances that you will suffer a
catastrophic data failure so I'd say why
chance it I personally can't really feel
the difference between like a low
performance SSD and a high performance
SST and like a daily driver type of
usage scenario and I doubt you can
either and it's kind of the same thing
when you go from a single
high-performance SSD to a raid 0
configuration Ria's you must get sick of
all these tweets and messages I'm
surprised you don't just say forget it
and have some lunch well we as it's sort
of 10:40 at night here by the way I'm
going to do this for about 20 more
minutes here guys something we're gonna
call it quits after 20 more minutes so
it would be like midnight snack time if
nothing else instead of lunch time ok so
apparently that didn't work last time
apparently I don't know how to block
people on Twitter so dududu looked ok so
hopefully we won't see anything else
from this character what do I hope my
son's first words are hopefully like dad
or mom something along those lines you
know keep it keep it simple
my favorite hockey team is the Vancouver
Canucks thank you for asking
although I am super super disappointed
that it looks like the NHL is going to
go to a lock up this year
I think that's just far more devastating
to the sport than commissioner Gary
Bettman thinks and I yeah like that guy
is such a Yahoo Janine's once note I
think about that leaked iphone 5 video
you know I honestly haven't seen it and
I really don't care like I said I don't
have that much interest in hardware that
I can't actually touch so yeah when I
when I can actually get my hands on an
iPhone 5 and play with it and I'll
definitely be interested to check it out
Oh slick is apparently here yeah come on
in apparently he's like he's right
outside the door there so oh oh hold on
hold on hold on hold on we can't show
his face we can't show his face no no
that's ok guys ok come in just don't oh
look there's Rumble - there's my kitty
teen hi kitty hey yeah who are you
talking to thank you guys
oh oh we almost oh I don't I think it's
too low res I don't think you guys will
be able to make out any details but
they're slick in the window everyone
loves that see there's this is how the
cats get up on the bookshelf by the way
there you go hey I'm putting a bookshelf
there it's pretty good stuff okay so
let's go back to the live stream
so I sent slick a message I don't know
if you've read my email that I sent you
like an hour ago
okay so slick I have tasked him with the
task of coming up with a more effective
way for us to test SSDs because like
look at all these SSDs we've got here
got like the crucial one and we've got
like the Plextor one and I'm gonna rip
the vertex floor out of my wife's
computer so that we can test that too
and the problem is that PC mark 7 is not
cooperating with us all the time so we
definitely want a we definitely want a
better way to benchmark stuff and slick
finally brought back the 35 70 K that he
borrowed how long ago did you borrow
this two months ago three months ago so
here he has brought this back to me
after after much much nagging see Intel
confident you guys aren't gonna be able
to read this but it says Intel
confidential you're gonna have to trust
me and it's a 35 70 K and I finally have
it back so uh yeah exciting somehow okay
let's see if we can find some more
tweets so check this out i'm using i'm
using xsplit so i can actually this is
my live stream so i can stream like
tweets and so people can see what i'm
answering at the same time that i'm
answering in my grade
so let's giving me the nod he doesn't
look that impressed though Oh Kyle -
you're a total boss from that big island
next to you Thank You Kyle and you know
hailey Victoria and all of that good
stuff well Victoria is not the island
but I'm just assuming you live in
Victoria because you probably wouldn't
have an internet connection if you
weren't in Victoria I'm sorry I'm sorry
it's not total wilderness over there I'm
sure that there's lots of civilized
something Eric Bentley if I'm not gaming
but using applications like Premiere and
After Effects we'll quadrille cards give
me a great benefit on rendering you know
what there's a lot of great articles out
there about the benefits of Quadro cards
so if you're actually was doing some
reading about this recently so if you're
doing editing in 4k for example it can
accelerate the playback process so you
can playback
a lot of what you're working on you can
preview it in real time as opposed to
rendering it first so it has some really
cool benefits but you know nothing for
gaming whatsoever so you know what do
some research specifically on premiere
and After Effects find out if it
accelerates the things that you're doing
and if it does then yes go for it get a
Quadro I'm probably going to be looking
into one in the near future for some
upcoming projects as well so you know I
can be learning how to use Quadro
buddies Amir wants to know if I've ever
tried liquid nitrogen overclocking I
actually have not though the most I've
done is around minus 20 to minus 25
degrees with chilled chilled windshield
the icer so that's what that's what I
was into for a little bit that was on my
what were they called the Core 2 Duo XT
600 and I had that thing at 4 gigahertz
stable 24/7 stable on my p5 wth was boss
and the the air conditioner unit that
sat next to my computer actually weighed
far more than the computer and I hard
core destroyed that board with all the
like insulation that I put on in
everything it was it was fun but the
kind of thing you do once kind of like
slicks oil cooled computer which
recently died so like can I get a sad
face he's given me the sad face so it
died and it's gone and he's not going to
do it again but it was fun
- I saw a meal on your picture feed it
looked at vegan I am NOT vegan and I
have no idea what you're talking about
because everything I eat has meat in it
but seriously I actually don't know I
mean I take up pictures of a lot of food
like I think I took a picture of like
cereal and so oh no that's not begin
anyway because milk is delicious
actually no it's not delicious but
cereal is really gross without it so
that's where we're at I actually hate
milk but I've tried you ever tried apple
juice and cereal is awful
apple juice or Rice Krispies and because
I poured it my mom made me finish eating
it
is the worst experience ever so got some
sake I'm like four right but these are
the kinds of traumatic memories that
stick with to you uh thank you for
reminding me of that I'm like I'm like
tearing up now it's fantastic
Rishi wants to know if I know that
Raptor gaming peripherals brand has been
acquired by Coursera I didn't know that
it's a lower-cost brand that they can
bring lower class peripherals to the
market under and I've got a good buddy
of mine who's the general manager of
Corsair in Canada so he he let me know
all about it and I was like okay cool
and that's pretty much where the
conversation went Diego can you announce
your hangouts a few days earlier on your
tech tips channel I do but I know that
not everybody sees every everything you
know what okay Oh McHale yes I've chosen
a motherboard I'm gonna be using it as
gigabyte x79 s UD 5p or something along
those lines the 5p yeah something like
the new the new C 606 chips that one
it's outstanding all new power design
that doesn't squeal awesome as for all
the people who were upset about sort of
how how picky I was about my my high-end
products and whether they make whining
noises or not you know people are
calling me a diva and whatnot okay maybe
I'm a diva but if you spend $300 on
something do you expect it to be perfect
when it's a motherboard and its sole
purpose is to plug in other things it
actually doesn't do anything else it
does not contribute to the performance
of your computer beyond making sure it's
using you know a reasonably good sound
chipset or LAN chip setters whatever
else so yeah yeah it's unacceptable to
me if it makes weird obnoxious noises so
there you go no I think we should all
hold barred we're manufacturers to
higher standards um I want some true
tests on a 7970 toxic because no one has
done an empirical test
Joseph it's totally irrelevant because I
hear Joseph right there because a 7970
at clock speeds x and y for the core in
the memory equals some other 79-78
course b x and memory y so find some guy
who has one and who's willing to
benchmark it at the same as the Toxic
default clocks and you'll know exactly
how well up four will perform there is
no voodoo magic clock speed equals clock
speed when we're using the same GPU with
the same frame buffer - do you think we
are ever gonna see ddr4 and is there a
possibility that single sticks could
hold 16 gigs
oh cool j0 that's about like asking me
if we're ever gonna see processors that
perform better than the ones today yes
of course we will - I'd like to know if
I'm better off going with an i5 or i7
third generation for gaming and some
rendering if you're doing rendering you
want the i7 with hyper-threading if
you're just gaming an i-5 will do you
just fine
Brandon Olson will I ever interview -
Torvalds for a video called Linus on
Linus I can tell you right now if I ever
did the video would not be called - on
Linus because that's just terrible these
guys are killing me here and see look
you're killing me again 476 new
interactions when we're okay next week
we're gonna switch to twitch TV and we
are definitely going to change the
format of the questions people are
sending in because I'm gonna use slow
mode so that people can't send me the
same questions over and over again
because it really makes it harder for me
to get to everybody's questions here
we've got a mirror how much is my
electricity bill I don't know my wife
deals with it so yeah there you go all
right so yeah this guy's really ruining
it for everyone here that's a real shame
b-roll best headset for gaming and music
7h done and anything with a clip-on mic
oh oh you use a headset with a built in
micro headphones with a clip-on mic that
depends on your well it depends what you
want to do you want to use headphones
look
much better headphones out there than
there are headsets most headsets are not
very good especially these ones they're
incredibly uncomfortable okay Luke wants
to know ROG for gaming or not the answer
is so you're asking me if a Republic of
gamers product is for gaming yes do you
want to spend the extra on an ROG
product it depends they have some perks
they have some some extra stuff that you
might like and if you like it then you
should buy one and if you don't like it
then you probably shouldn't I mean I
think there's there's so many there's so
many articles and so many reviews and so
many forum threads about all of these
products that it's it's really not that
complicated to figure out if it makes
sense for you if you know you need I
guess here's the answer if you know you
need the features on a rampage or a
Maximus level board then buy one and if
you don't know that you need it then the
answer is that you probably don't and
Asus has lots of other fantastic
products that are not ROG branded if you
like the color scheme there's another
reason you might want to buy one should
I get
a GTX 690 or a GTX 680 you have a 1440
screen you should get a 660ti oh oh you
mean ah see I thought you meant 1440 by
900 or whatever that weird resolution is
no you mean 2560 by 1440 ah I don't know
get a 680 if you don't like it get
another 680 it'll be the same net result
as your 690 one of my favorite cherry MX
keys generally speaking blues however I
really like the blacks on the neonics
design well 60 this looks giving me the
thumbs up he's such a keyboard diva if
we're holding out for four-game
understable wait some extra copy or
tepees I don't know that I mean most of
the current stuff does support 4k over
4k is in the media very very commanding
no Nathan wants to know my x5 and Steve
and I don't really use expired and even
most would fall so sweet thank you very
has a very that's a fairly private
person question mark and I'm gonna tell
you right now there's weird at first
our minutes
Thank You Pete why do I see this nice
professional for people to show their
face Richie dude okay Todd give me
really a good question oh he's very real
difference in Ramirez between bands yes
of course there is you can't a designer
can often be a little difference for me
it's between products I mean there's a
lot of information and the challenge is
that sometimes yeah so I think we just
pull the unbalanced and hope
come around is gonna be people they're
using TV and yes there is
you can do a lot of research out there
and you can find easily they can be hard
to hear about some atoms because you can
see a lot of complaints leather product
but that may not be related to the rate
but it may just be a pop star example
videos to be there text we people think
it's like this problem at SSD because
there's a lot of complaints about it it
is beautiful to almost every other
process even a large region and even if
Adams been after the same heart rate I
got any complaints so yeah I can be
pretty the green question for me
personally anything that Kim unless
there's nothing deserving I got better
that's taking the color reproduction are
much more compared to any the a ride
