whatever this is of the epic I switched
trial with Windows Phone 8 so I'm gonna
start with telling you guys the
conclusion the conclusion is I am NOT
going to be switching to Windows Phone 8
I feel like there's some things that are
better about it versus iOS but there are
some things that were serious problems
for me that would make it so that I
would actually you see I'm holding an 8
s now because I spent the last week of
my I switched using the 8 s rather than
the 8 X the reason for that being that
especially when I'm typing so on the 8x
I have small hands and I've had people
say oh get a note too because you'll get
you know I'm not going to get used to it
I'm not gonna get used to my hands are
actually just small and can't reach so
so I wanted to switch to a phone that I
can actually type one-handed with like I
could on my iPhone 4 and I found that
pretty much fixed every complaint I had
about the keyboard and the keyboard now
that I've spent some time with it on a
phone that I can actually use I like a
lot better than iOS and it's for a
couple simple things number one is the
inclusion of Smiley's here that makes a
big difference and then there's a
there's your most recently used ones and
you can it'll just default to that every
time once you select that so so you can
just navigate to all the ones that you
actually like and the inclusion of
period and comma here because I do
actually still care about punctuation
even though I'm mostly texting so
totally got used to that liked that
about it but I have a whole other list
of stuff that's bothering me so I've
been using rally for tweets which is
apparently out there it is well it looks
a little something like that and I was
having some weird issues with it like in
the timeline I'd click something here
but it would actually open up the one
under it or two under it there'd be like
these weird offsets on the touch
interface and it was driving me crazy to
the point where I was ready to just get
off Windows Phone 8 entirely because the
stock Twitter active was horror
and then rally was having all these
issues but Twitter has updated their
native app and it is actually pretty
awesome now like they've actually put
some time and attention to it into it to
the same sort of standard as on the
other platform so it's yeah
really really liking the Twitter
experience although this sort of
epitomizes some of our not epitomizes I
don't know whatever it Ellis traits some
of the issues I've had with Windows
Phone 8 in general is a lot of the apps
tend to be not that well labeled if
you're not already a Twitter user so you
you haven't used Twitter on a mobile
platform before and you go you open up
the Twitter app on Windows Phone 8 well
what is everything ok home I get what's
that what's that what's that what's the
difference between this and home I don't
know so you have to actually just like
dink around with it in order to figure
out what anything is and I mean if
you're experienced Twitter users sure
but as someone coming into it
like this just isn't it's just not
labeled well you know like there's these
things down here you got some like
settings and stuff and anyway so we're
done with that yeah so way better
overall
I prefer swipes to clicks so I prefer
scroll so one of the complaints I had
early on was that I whips okay well
let's go back to hold on you know what
let's go to a song list
that'll do as if you guys can't just
freeze the frame and read that stuff
anyway so let's go to a oh right I don't
have the music loaded onto the 8's okay
fine we will go to we'll go to a contact
list right okay so the way that you
navigate from letter to letters instead
of scrolling down the side like you do
on Android and iOS you click here and
then click the letter of I'm just make
sure there's nothing so you and then you
click the letter and it takes it jumps
to the right spot I actually find this
not as easy to work with for a couple of
reasons number one is that I find like I
said I find touches less intuitive than
just scrolling down the right-hand side
because that's where my thumb is anyway
I'm right-handed for a left-handed
person maybe that's not as good the
other thing is that now that I'm here I
kind of have to
Peck because it's gonna be a long time
before I memorize this grid and if I'm
looking for eat
that's actually not conveniently within
my reach whereas this entire right side
is within my reach so I find that faster
and more intuitive and that goes for
scrolling long lists whether it's
contacts whether it's installed
applications or whether it's things like
music I just I find this not as good and
then you see when you don't have
something for every letter like some of
them are just kind of grayed out and it
just it makes it more visually confusing
I find to actually navigate it generally
speaking far more crashes and hangs than
iOS in my month of using it and I think
that's one of the reasons why it's
important to use the platform for a
month before drawing any conclusions I
mean I did the the in progress updates
where you know some of them you know I'd
say things that were just totally wrong
and I'd say things that that we're right
but sort of more by chance than from
experience with it whereas now I
actually feel like I know how to use the
platform and any complaints I have are
based on we'll know this is what it's
actually like to use it for a long
period of time one thing I noticed about
the h8s versus the 8x was that the
spacebar is the thing that seems to get
shorter it got a little tiny spacebar in
there so I know I said that I do like
things like the smiley face but I mean
come on language why does that need to
be there so spacebar wouldn't be
something that I would have liked to see
extended because I find myself often
hitting these instead on the condensed
keyboard on the 8's so the 8x had a
slightly bigger one just because of the
white the the bigger screen
I prefer folders and desktops for
navigation versus this tile interface
because tile is interesting and I mean
okay so you press the windows button to
go up to the top and you know you can
prioritize things based on size but what
I discovered is even on the 8x which has
a bigger screen I am never going to want
to make an icon like here let's find one
that goes full-size like photos goes
full-size I think I'm never gonna want
to make an icon like or not an icon
whatever a tile this big because it
takes up so much space that it's just
ridiculous like maybe if it was
something that I absolutely
needed to have sort of in my way all the
time than fine but as it is if you're
even using so if you're using those
you'd get like three per scroll on your
screen if you're using the medium-sized
ones you're only gonna get about eight
per scroll on your screen and if you're
using small ones even then you're only
getting about what if whatever it is
like 32 per screen so you're actually
scrolling to find applications whereas
when you compare that to a folder based
structure like on the iPhone 4 where you
can go folder folder folder folder
folder folder folder folder and put like
9 things in each one it's less hunting
for things because you categorize them
you go okay I want my utilities one
click two clicks and I'm in whereas if I
have to go scroll Scroll scroll to find
something I mean even okay so on iOS I
might scroll from desktop to Jessica I
keep everything on my first and second
page so I might have to go scroll click
click so I find that that a little bit
easier anoxia so the the argument after
that is oh well you can just swipe to
the right and see all your apps that way
scrolling slow and then I still have to
go click click potentially scroll click
to actually get into something and the
interface for anything should always be
as few clicks as possible and I find
that this tile interface doesn't really
achieve that for me dedicated camera
buttons awesome every phone should have
one I'd love it if it was a little bit
more stiff because I found myself
accidentally hitting it but when you
want it just being ready to go sort of
hold down a button and you're ready to
take pictures is is actually just kind
of freaking amazing one of the other
problems for me and it I mean mobile
platforms is all about apps cloud media
is not nearly or a cloud player or
whatever they call this thing is not
nearly as polished as air video on iOS I
found that extremely frustrating because
I do like to watch videos on my phone
that I stream from my home server so
yeah Skype integration also wasn't as as
smooth as it is with iOS so I mean check
out the Skype app hopefully I'm doing
something wrong here and someone can
post a comment on the video whatever I'm
not signed in well okay the point is no
it's ok I couldn't find a setting within
sky
to make it so that it stayed signed in
all the time and would push me chat
notifications it just worked on iOS it's
like yeah Apple just works but no but
seriously it just worked and then this
one it's like I got Skype calls but not
written message notifications I mean
that's very frustrating to me because I
find them like hours later so yeah it
just okay so what I'm trying to say is
maybe there's a way to make it work
maybe you can force it to somehow but
what I said was Skype integration is not
as smooth as iOS because you have to
fuss with it so that's very confusing
and the inability to turn off auto
rotate honestly is just a deal-breaker
for me like I can't function without
being able to turn off auto rotate even
on iOS I find it incredibly frustrating
that on the phone you can only lock in
portrait you can't lock in landscape but
not being able to lock at all being
forced to have Auto rotate on no matter
what is just asinine and then there's a
huge thread on Microsoft forums asking
for it I've had people tell me no you
must be wrong there must be a way to do
it no there actually isn't a way to do
it even though it must be the simplest
possible thing to integrate so it just
it'll always auto rotate so what that
means is if you actually want to view
something in portrait mode and you're
laying in bed you want to read something
oh oh it moves around oh well actually
hold on no I don't want it so you have
to kind of hold it like this and then
scroll through it's just ridiculous
one thing that was way better than iOS
is integrating multiple accounts so
going okay yeah I want like hotmail
calendar and a gmail calendar and I want
some other random thing and I want my
Facebook and my LinkedIn contacts and I
want my gmail contacts the way that it
integrates things within the people app
here as well as your contacts as well as
your calendar is just awesome
way better than iOS where there's
certain things that are just randomly
weirdly locked down like iOS will grab
your google calendar but not your Google
contacts and you have to kind of fight
with it whereas this one you just kind
of go sign in sign in sign in sign in
sign and done and I mean even things
like like multiple entries when you have
someone on Facebook and linked
and you had them in your phone already
it'll even merge them and then there's
tools too to merge them differently or
unmerge them or play around with them
however you need to absolutely awesome
that's probably one of the high points
of Windows Phone 8 for me
Nokia's Drive app was another one I
don't think know if it's called Nokia
drive anymore soon as we called here
drive now I don't know why they would
have changed the number oh yeah this is
gonna show right where I am right now
but that's okay is awesome when it finds
your destination I found it was a little
bit less reliable than Google Apps for
me our Google Maps rather for me here in
in Vancouver Canada so there you go it
might be perfect where you live but I
found it a little bit less consistent
internet explorer is awesome compared to
Safari going back to internet explorer
one of the things I complained about
last time was needing to go in here for
tabs
apparently this refresh button can be
changed to a tab button but that still
means I have to go to places for refresh
and I found that frustrating as well so
it's again it's just that more clicks
thing and last but not least see that
see the time there okay so if I'm
actually like I understand you want to
use as much space as possible for just
sort of actually viewing your content
but I think that because so many people
are moving away from wearing watches and
moving towards using their phones as
their only real time piece I found that
not having quick easy access to that
information
so especially battery life there's a
battery life app I don't know if I've
actually moved it onto the desktop of
the of the 8s no it looks like I haven't
but having things like battery life by
percentage and time and cell reception
always at the top I think is worth it
because it's just ridiculous when you're
when you're watching a video for example
actually I don't know if I don't know if
this one's gonna work right now okay
well let's not worry too much about like
that here let's go to a metro to metro
tubes awesome I really like this really
like this YouTube app so let's find
something and we're watching some video
so I'm used to in iOS just pressing on
something and having the time show up
for me and I I like that so I missed
that and always knowing the time
I think that's pretty much it so at the
end of the day I won't be switching but
what I will be doing is I will be doing
an Android I switched with the all-new
HTC One phone so this is pretty much as
high-end as it gets for an Android phone
so I'm gonna give it a shot
and Slick's got a little smirk on his
face going on over there cuz I said I
wouldn't do it but I'll be going back to
my iPhone 4 in the meantime all honestly
having a newer phone really made me see
how slow the iPhone 4 is now cuz I've
gotten used to it I used it for like two
years so that that part's gonna be hard
to go back to I kind of wish I had a
more up-to-date phone but so I'm gonna
go back to the iPhone 4 till I can get
my hands on an HTC One but this has been
fun and guys leave a comment if you've
hung in this long leave a comment under
the video because I will be giving away
an HTC 8s I was going to give away the
8x but it turns out someone needed it so
I'll be giving away an HTC 8s to one of
the people who comments under the video
give me like a couple weeks and then
I'll contact you and you'll be getting a
free phone yay and as always don't
