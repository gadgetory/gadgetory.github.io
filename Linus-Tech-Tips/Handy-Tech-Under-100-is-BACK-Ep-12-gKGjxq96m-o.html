again but this time something new a
product that can simplify your DIY
projects and clamp your nipples at the
same time don't miss it
be quiet silent wings three fans use a
smooth-running 6-pull motor to remain
silent and cool your pc better check
them out at the link in the video
description number one here is the
spiritual successor to a product that I
bought a while back for a handy tech
then never ended up featuring because it
just didn't work that well this thing
sucks
every time I've used it I've been blown
away by how long it takes to adjust the
position of the arms and the poor
quality of the included magnifying glass
so I recently replaced it with a quad
hands helping hands that absolutely
blows it out of the water it includes
four locking alligator clamp terminated
flexible gooseneck arms attached to a
heavy powder-coated steel base two of
the arms are about six inches long these
ones will be ideal for smaller projects
where stability is key because a shorter
arm is inherently more stable then the
other two are about 15 inches long
making them ideal for holding larger
items reaching around to provide
additional stability to the small arms
or even taking care of your other needs
when you're busy and need to multitask
as far as suggested improvements go I
love this thing so far but some plastic
or rubber guards for the clamp teeth
might be nice so I don't have to cover
them to avoid risking scratching
something like a PCB and a couple extra
threaded holes tapped into the base
would let me expand it with more arms
both of which are low-cost upgrades that
could be very valuable to potential
customers which leads us then to item
number two another spiritual successor
this time to the Sennheiser HH 10 an
awesome desk clamping headphone holder
that was discontinued almost immediately
after I recommended it in handy tech
episode 1 almost three years ago this is
the brainwaves hanga and actually the
brainwaves trust as well both of them
are under 20 bucks for a
well-constructed
metal headphone hanger that will help
you keep your headphones off of your
or your monitor your desk your floor or
wherever else it is that you've got them
right now the difference between the two
is that the hanger clamps to the edge of
your desk just like the HH tended and
holds one pair of headphones while the
truss actually takes the space savings a
step further and sticks to the bottom of
your desk with an extra arm that you can
use to store your gaming headset and
your audiophile headphones for example
not bad given that it only costs a few
bucks more I'd like to see a wider more
curved top surface on both of them to
help avoid denting the headband foam on
the nice cans you spent your hard-earned
money on and I think the trust should
have a couple of holes in the base to
allow you to screw it into the bottom of
your desk if you want the included
adhesive appears to be the same
excellent stuff included by GoPro on
their mounts but it's one-time use and
quality double-sided tape is not exactly
available at the corner store so you
might have to wait if you had to order
it online or something
leading us then to the next product I am
a huge fan of the SteelSeries qck XXL a
900 millimeter by 400 millimeter mouse
pad that's big enough for your mouse and
your keyboard and like a secondary Mouse
on the other side for your laptop but at
40 bucks it's pretty expensive enter
reflex lab with their huge gaming mouse
pad for half the price it's a little
smaller it's the same width but about a
hundred millimeters shorter but I rarely
use the very top of my XXL anyway and
the huge gaming mouse pad has no
tracking issues has a pretty pleasing
soft texture to the top has the same
grippy bottom so it doesn't slide around
and rock stitched edges to prevent
fraying to boot if I'd seen this one
before I started working on this video
I'd have probably ordered the red lemon
version of what appears to be a very
similar product for only 14 bucks with
free prime shipping so you can check out
that one too but I haven't personally
tried that one and I don't feel
comfortable endorsing stuff
handy tech unless I've actually had my
hands on it and I have with the reflex
lab version leading us then to our last
item for the day these adorable little
thermal adhesive-backed heat sinks have
you ever wondered how you can add just a
little bit of extra cooling to a mod
maybe on a vrm module on your
motherboard or graphics card or to some
weird controller chip that just seems to
run too hot on an electronics project
well at 6 bucks for 20 of these they're
a great deal and sure to add not only
some cooling but also a little flair to
your next Raspberry Pi based project
which brings us finally to the full
disclosure part of these handy tech
since they're structured more as a
recommendation to buy with links below
to Amazon compared to a review item one
I purchased by me for me personally and
at work item number two I purchased by
me for my use at work since I'm still
using my H H 10 at home and for Terron
since he's been looking for something to
get his headphones off and away from his
desk item 3 was purchased by me just to
see if it was good before recommending
it because it was cheap and I was like
oh that's cool and item 4 was purchased
by me because I saw it and I could think
of a thousand times that I could have
used a little heatsink like that in the
past even having gone as far as to cut
up Swift tech NC 14s into quarters with
a hacksaw when I had a motherboard whose
vrm always overheated number of years
ago audio blocks has one of the largest
