the cat tree you can see they're
definitely enjoying it so far come on up
baby
nope now they'd rather fight with each
other
it's got a lot more carpet on it now so
they can actually do some of their
climbing on it you know and I was hoping
to be able to get him to poke his head
out because it's really adorable now
he's eating the carpet don't do that
don't do that baby
there we go and then he should pull it
back inside with him if he's still doing
what he did before come on I can't be
the only one who thinks this is adorable
good boy oh now we got two cats poking
their head through the window you go
form it this happened right after I
turned the camera off
oh okay fighter you'd say he'll crawl
right out of the window I wouldn't be
all that surprised at this point but
yeah we're making really good progress
on the cat tree hopefully I'll be
updating later today or later this week
with finished finished video of the the
cat tree here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
