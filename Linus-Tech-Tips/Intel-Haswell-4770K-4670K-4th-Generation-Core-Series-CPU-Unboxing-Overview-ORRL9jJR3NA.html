usa.com welcome to my unboxing of
intel's fourth generation Core Series
processor codename Haswell and the
reason for that is if you were to ask me
- can I have I would say well you better
make sure you have a new motherboard
because this is an all new chip on an
all-new socket LGA 1150 is now the
socket for this and it's a new chipset
so we're using the z87 chipset as
opposed to these e77 chipset that was
the most current one on LGA 1155 so
you're still going to have those same
enthusiasts features overclocking is
supported best on k-series SKUs of
course you've also got support for Smart
Response technology which is using SSD
caching to accelerate your boot drive as
long as everything's plugged into the
chipset in fact the z87 supports six
SATA 3 ports natively as opposed to just
two on z77 and of course things like
lucid logics virtue MVP so that you can
use the onboard graphics core on your
CPU to do things like video transcoding
and use the CPU for the things that it's
best at so it's very similar to the
previous generation platform but more
newer and more better you know more USB
3 more SATA 3 all of that good kind of
stuff now this is intel's second
processor that uses a 22 nanometer
manufacturing process the first was Ivy
Bridge which was a die shrunk version of
Sandy Bridge so Intel's tik-tok strategy
for releasing CPUs means they will
change the architecture then they'll
shrink it then they'll change the
architecture and they'll shrink it so
this is a new architecture that means
that we should see the biggest
performance improvements usually with an
architecture change versus with a
process shrink however this generation
is going to be a little bit weird
because the last one Ivy Bridge we got a
10% IPC performance improvement versus
nd Bridge in spite of the fact that it
was just a die shrink quote-unquote so
based on that we're getting about
another 10 percent with Haswell that
might not seem like a generational gap
because it's the first time that the
architecture has changed since Sandy
Bridge in theory but because it's been
more of a gradual progression of changes
it's still pretty significant so it's
about a 20% IPC improvement over the two
generations now ago Sandy Bridge
processors so which CPUs should you care
about the answer is actually well it
depends if you're an enthusiast and you
want to overclock you're going to want a
K series CPU so the 2k series ones are
the 4770k and the 4670 K so the 4770k is
clocked a little bit higher 3.5
gigahertz all the weight or going up to
3.9 vs. 3.4 turbo into 3.8 for the 46 70
K which is an i5 also the 4770k features
hyper threading due to its i7 heritage
however there's more to Haswell than
just overclockable unlocked processors
that perform really well these are both
quad cores and that would be the lower
power consumption part so has well has
dramatically improved power consumption
due to some more advanced SI states that
allow the processor to turn itself way
down to a very low power consumption
state but still remain functional and
with their beefed up onboard graphics
offering up to three times the
performance of the last generation Intel
HD graphics then these chips will be
very interesting particularly for
entry-level gamers who aren't going to
add a discrete graphics card to their
system but still want to be able to play
some modern games which i think is very
very cool particularly think about this
as well with that lower power
consumption and that better graphics
performance we're looking at a whole new
world for things like ultra books and
tablets has a little boxing shot three
take three we've got that same support
for dual channel ddr3 memory but we're
also getting some new instruction sets
which over time as software becomes
optimized for them could start to become
a real advantage and the way over
fucking's changed is kind of interesting
as well so number one is that it now
supports base clock straps which means
that you can actually change the base
clock so remember the clock speed of
your processor is determined by your
multiplier in your base clock so you can
now change your base clock as opposed to
just your multiplier using straps on
your board so you could go okay I want
to have you know I'm Melvin today's
clock of 125 now and then I can make
adjustments from there to my multiplier
or even tweak it up and down a little
bit that's cool that wasn't supported on
Ivy Bridge because as soon as you
started to change the base clock more
than a little bit it would throw other
plots on the motherboard such as your
PCI Express clock completely out of
whack and cause a no post situation so
that's neat another thing is they've
integrated voltage regulation right on
the CPU so what that means in theory is
that pretty much all the way from you
know an asus channel level z87 a board
all the way up to something like a
Maximus six extreme you're going to have
a pretty similar overclocking experience
until you start to get into very exotic
cooling methods and very very high
voltages which is exciting because it
means that from an affordability
standpoint it's going to be more than
it's about more than just how much the
CPU cost which is going to be similar to
last gen but you might be able to get
away with squeezing more performance out
of a less expensive board which
personally I find exciting well thank
you for checking out my unboxing your
first look at Haswell I'm going to
probably call this a 4770k and 46 70k
unboxing because those are the ones I
focus on um don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other computer videos and I guess I
should open the box at some point right
let me do that here you go my heat sink
looks exactly like the Ivy Bridge one
about some thermal compound on the
bottom for pin pwm fan you're going to
have a manual and a three year warranty
documentation in yours and you're going
to have a CPU itself yours won't look
quite like this though because mine says
Intel confidential and yours will say 46
70 K in this case our 4770k on the top
don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
