price-fixing and the GPU mining boom and
subsequent bust 2018 has been one heck
of a ride but now as the holidays
approach it's looking like a fantastic
time all of a sudden to build a new
gaming PC and it's my job to find the
best deals at $500 $1,000 and $2,000 for
you so naturally I didn't do it
I had Anthony do it but it's ok he did a
great job speaking of great our sponsor
iFixit give the gift of fixing this
holiday season with iFixit SPRO tech
tool kit visit ifixit.com forward slash
linus at the link below and get yours
today
before we begin a note about our part
selections we decided not to use sale
pricing except where components are more
or less perpetually on sale where we use
the price that it was available at most
often this way you guys can expect these
prices or less so if you see better
deals on these parts or on other parts
go for it this video is just meant to be
a guideline so let's start with our
budget just game PC with only 500 bucks
to spend every dollar needs to
contribute to gaming performance in some
way and when we look at last year's 2017
was rough we just barely managed a Rison
processor and we had a case with an even
more myth power supply dad this year we
were able to use the much faster
not to mention cheaper Rison 320 200 G
and this time we also get a be 350
chipset motherboard which means we can
actually overclock it a little bit now
sadly we are still stuck with 8 gigs of
RAM but since we've got 4 slots on our
board we can get a dual-channel kit to
improve the performance of our bandwidth
hungry Rison cpu without sacrificing
future upgrade ability but wait there's
more this time around we swung a
separate case and 80 plus bronze power
supply with its own three year warranty
and for storage while this was kind of a
no-brainer
so our sshd unfortunately ended up
almost 10 percent more expensive for the
capacity this year but it's fast enough
that you're not going to feel the crunch
too quickly while you're gaming so we
had to make a compromise there and it
was a worthwhile one because you will be
gaming we're picking up a Radeon rx 570
this year the 4 gig model of course but
that gtx 1050 Ti from yesteryear is
finally gone and we've got performance
more akin to a GTX 1063 gig this is one
of those it's always on sale cases
because Newegg claims it's on sale but
looking at the pricing history it's been
on sale for the entire month of November
and it sold for not much more going all
the way back to October so the heavens
have opened up and smiled
the budget gamers this year because by
our math you can grab this set up for
just over five hundred and one dollars
on Newegg or just under five hundred if
you spread your purchases to other
vendors moving on we've got our game now
mid-range PC and last year we were in
pretty rough shape on this one - if I'm
being honest yeah we managed to rise in
five but it was a quad-core this year
we're up to six cores thanks to the most
versatile CPU in our recent CPU buyer's
guide the risin 5 2600 which hit C it's
even $5 cheaper by the way thanks AMD
and what's more we're able to get proper
ddr4 3,200 memory to feed the beast for
less than what we paid for 24 hundred
megahertz last year I'm so glad that
whole Ram thing is over this time for
our boot drive we're sticking with solid
state storage and this is crazy we are
getting double the capacity this time
around for five dollars less making this
easily the biggest SSD that this segment
has ever been able to afford an extra
bonus is that at one terabyte you're not
gonna have to burn as many erase cycles
swapping games around to fit in a more
confined SSD and it's even MDOT - moving
on our case doesn't have a window to
show off the clean interior but the
corsair carbide 270 our offers both
build quality and creature comfort
improvements over the Thermaltake versa
complete with easier to clean removable
dust filters and then going into it is
the bigger 650 watt variant of the EVGA
b3 power supply that we used last year
giving us a bit of room to upgrade later
on remember the guys this is EVGA is
like actually good even though it's 80
plus bronze PSU line and it should serve
you well for years to come finally we
also picked up a gtx 1070 TI
for cool 20 dollars less than we paid
for the 1070 that got us through the
last two years and by the way it's not
likely that these things will stick
around for too much longer the existing
10 series stock is slowly but surely
disappearing from the top down so either
move fast or hopefully the r-tx
GTX whatever it is 2060
ends up being a decent replacement only
time will tell but we do know right now
though is that in total this build
weighed in at a hair over a grand but
that's less than five percent of the
budget and many of these parts regularly
go on sale and it's freaking awesome so
happy shopping
finally we haven't forgotten about you
make a ballers out there you so for you
guys we've got the game on high end
gaming rig which at two thousand dollars
should last you quite a while now
looking at every other year's game on
build you might think that us going from
an h EDT or high-end desktop socket down
to a core i7 on the consumer socket is a
downgrade and in terms of PCI Express
Lanes
you'd be right but in terms of
processing power
we're actually gaining to course that
are each faster than any previous CPU
that we've used in these builds which
more than makes up for their lower
thread count due to the loss of hyper
threading we also lose quad-channel
memory but we keep our 32 gigs of DDR 4
3200 Ram this time in the form of a dual
channel kit that leaves two slots open
for future expansion our storage
improvement this time around is in
picking up the SSD that we used in our
game now build the WD blue one terabyte
M 2 SATA which gives us one terabyte of
fast storage to go along with our 4
terabytes of 5400 rpm spinning iron so
the OS and commonly used apps and games
go on the SSD and the longer-term
storage and lesser used games go on the
hard drive with plenty of room on both
or you can even check out a software
caching solution like primo cache split
up your SSD and kind of divide and
conquer that way now we're keeping our C
Sonic 80 plus gold power supply and are
knocked to a cooler from last year
because they're great deals and the
cooler in particular is good enough to
handle quite a bit more than our core i7
9700 K can put out and then for our case
we've splurged on the tempered-glass
Corsair crystal 460 X with all of its
RGB goodness now in light of the case
choice some folks might prefer a liquid
cooler for aesthetics but just be
prepared to spend a little extra for the
privilege to get comparable cooling
capacity to what we've already got which
leads us then to our most
reversal pick this time around last year
we practically begged AMD and NVIDIA to
give us a solid upgrade of some sort so
maybe next year we'll get a $2,000
system that's worth upgrading to from
our 2016 model like can we AMD and
NVIDIA if we're really good and we've
got it
the r-tx 2070 yes I know RTX is nowhere
near worth it at this time but that
doesn't mean that the r-tx 2070 isn't a
good graphics card it's just an
overpriced graphics card and by the time
we wrote up this buyer's guide brand-new
stock of GTX 10 80s and 1080 T eyes was
essentially depleted so unless you want
to buy those used which by the way is a
valid option one that we'd recommend
these guides only include products that
you can buy brand new in a store so this
is the best performance for gaming that
we could get into this price bracket and
it ain't bad for productivity either on
that subject this video is about gaming
PC's and of course that was the goal but
as it turns out all of our builds across
the board ended up pretty well balanced
for either gaming or productivity tasks
and we ended up inadvertently following
some of our own advice from our recent
CPU buyer's guide so as it always is
with custom pcs the sky is the limit in
terms of configurability but we think
that our rigs make a great starting
point for almost anyone who isn't
looking for a hyper specialized build
so now we'll wrap up then with full
disclosure time we don't get any
kickbacks for manufacturers for our
holiday buyer's guide parts but what we
do get is a commission if you buy them
using the links below so if you're in
the market go ahead and check them out
it truly is a great time to buy a PC
especially a value 1
20:18 was like a real roller coaster of
pricing and availability but here we are
finally at the end of it with a tangible
improvement across the board over
previous years so may your holidays be
filled with tech and gaming cheer this
is even visible in the frame let's bring
some
holiday cheer yeah and may your holidays
also be filled with screwdriver kids I
thinks it's Mantic it has 112 steel bits
comes complete with standard bits like
Phillips and flathead but also Torx
tripoint and game bits as well and
includes not one but two aluminum
screwdriver handles a hefty quarter inch
drive for full-size applications and a
smaller four millimeter for precision
work both drivers feature magnetic bit
sockets knurled grips and silky-smooth
spinning tops and all iFixit tools are
backed by a lifetime warranty so if
something breaks they'll fix it for free
that is how warranties work visit
ifixit.com forward slash Lynas and pick
up the new Manta kit today because if
you don't then when tomorrow rolls
around and you need it you won't have it
