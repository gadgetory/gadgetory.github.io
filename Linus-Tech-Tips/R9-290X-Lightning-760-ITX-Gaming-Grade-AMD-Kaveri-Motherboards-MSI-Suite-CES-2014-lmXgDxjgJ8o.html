brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital we're here in the MSI
suite at CES 2014 and they've got some
pretty exciting stuff on display
starting oh that's heavy with the r9
290x lightning now unlike the GTX 780
lightning which we actually checked out
not that long ago there is no GPU
reactor on the back however not to worry
guys because even though GTX 780
lightning had a GPU reactor which in
theory provides more power to the GPU
NVIDIA has a power limit that's sort of
a pesky overclocking limiter so to speak
AMD has imposed no such limitation on
msi so you will be able to use their
triple over voltage features as well as
this incredibly beefy I mean two and a
half slot looking cooler to unlock the
full potential of the r9 290x GPU so
it's got the usual features you've got a
full black back plate as well as a unis
ink and then of course the massive heat
pipe cooler that has four heat pipes
running all the way through it looks
like it's actually got five there's one
going the other way it also has a try
frozer cooler so unlike the more
traditional twin frozr cooler you can
not only have more fans you can also
control them independently so the two
outer ones are on one PWM control and
the middle one is actually on a separate
one now in line with the the hint before
about how much power you can feed this
thing it has two 8-pin pci express power
inputs and one pci express six pin power
input so I'm pretty excited to see what
we can do with that particular card when
we get our hands on it on the other side
of the spectrum we've got the GTX 760
ITX so it has a single eight pin power
connector and it is only a little bit
longer about an inch and change longer
than the length of a standard pci
express slot this goes along with a bit
of a focus that msi has here on ITX
design so in the past we only really saw
we I mean we've seen their dat seven ITX
gaming branded motherboard but only on
the Intel side will now we're getting an
AMD performance optimized ITX board too
this is on the FM two plus platform it's
going to be compatible with amd's
upcoming Kaveri CPU it all has pci
express 16x it's got intel Wi-Fi it's
got all the kind of features that you
want black PCB all that kind of stuff so
you can now finally build a truly
performance grade AMD ITX system
something we haven't really been able to
do up until now speaking of other AMD
designs they now have gaming boards for
AMD both in an ATX flavor and an matx
flavor just as a reminder all nsis
gaming branded boards use their military
class concept so that is high quality
components they also feature audio boost
which is a headphone amped audio output
and they also use killer on board
networking in order to give you guys
that prioritization feature that enables
your games to have the highest priority
out of all of your network traffic of
course they come with the usual msi
gaming color scheme which is a black and
red with a matte PCB look that will
definitely turn some heads the last one
here we've got is a completely
unreleased product this isn't even
finished yet in fact it doesn't even
seem to have a name it's just a m1 and
then on the back there's fs1 I whatever
all of these things mean this is an AMD
kabini board so that's not a proper
desktop platform hold on a second what's
going on well Kabini actually has some
pretty interesting advantages over some
of the other processors available one is
that it could be powerful enough for a
relatively low usage desktop number two
is it's available in up to an X 6
configuration and number three is the
onboard graphics aren't that bad so
especially when you factor in the way
that AMD is pushing forward on opencl
and compute to increase the performance
of an overall platform without focusing
that much on cpu power the fact that you
are going to be able to have a socketed
upgradable kabini board and an ITX form
factor could be very interesting to
folks who are looking for something
power efficient that's powerful enough
to do basic stuff like say for example
play some super meat boy but not
necessarily powerful enough for the most
you know demanding games but could
handle something like game streaming on
steamos where's Linus going with this I
think I just said
don't miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
guys our trip to the show is powered by
NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service and of
course our other sponsors are corsair
Memory and western digital thanks guys
we couldn't have done this without you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
