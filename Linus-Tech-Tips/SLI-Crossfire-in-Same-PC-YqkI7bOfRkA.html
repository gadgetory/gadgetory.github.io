gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more shopping for a
graphics card is tough AMD has all kinds
of technologies like crossfire trueaudio
mantle raid OpenCL performance and HD 3d
while NVIDIA has sli g-sync 3d vision
cuda physx and game streaming no matter
how much you spend on your computer you
can't have all of these things at the
same time or can you this is it the
ultimate no compromises gaming machine
the name de vidya titanium 3000 ultra xt
Platinum Edition it's got a core i7
processor 16 gigs of dominator memory
and most importantly - gtx 780 Ti is an
SLI and - Radeon r9 290 X's in crossfire
simply choose which graphics card vendor
you want powering the system at any
given time fire up your game and enjoy
all the exclusive technologies from both
sides on one computer truthfully guys
this is not a joke
here are some Far Cry 3 benchmarks at
2560 by 1440 very high preset and this
hulking beast of a system can be yours
for the value price of only $5,000 and
you're sitting there asking yourself is
he kidding or am I missing something
here good question guys this video isn't
intended to convince you to run out and
put a handful of different graphics
cards in your system to make sure that
you're not missing out on anything that
would be crazy and therein lies the true
purpose of this video or the average
gamer shopping for a graphics card is
already hard enough graphics cards are
major purchases so there's a lot of
research to do on top of the price you
have to consider performance in the
games you play cooling and then you have
to pick between a dozen different brands
that are all available and now with the
introduction of AMD's mantle API and
Nvidia g-sync technology it feels like
on top of all
that gamers have to decide months or
even years ahead of time how they want
to experience their games rather than
just if they want to experience them
because you can only have one and you're
going to be stuck with it until you
replace it we've seen this before with
physics but most people didn't notice or
care because physics never saw
widespread adoption and beyond
franchises like Batman and games like
Borderlands 2 the gameplay experience
was never really affected much by its
implementation right now is different
though right now mantle and gsync look
like they may be widely supported and
sharpers will have to choose at the time
of purchase whether they want smooth
paste frames with decent graphics with a
decent graphics card and display or
mentals so far unparalleled ability to
leverage multi-core CPUs along with some
tiny GPU performance improvements and
they have to pick all of this without
even knowing things like whether future
titles they want to play will support
mantle or whether or not g-sync monitors
will be worth buying what the hardware
guys are asking us to do is crazy
if this is the solution for a gamer to
have every experience each game
developer intended then isn't it time
for something to change and this doesn't
even address individual games that will
support cross vendor technologies like
star citizen nothing I do can let me
experience mantle and physics in that
game when it comes out at the same time
I will always be not quite getting the
full experience now I'm not gonna say
who's wrong or right in fact I'd love to
hear what you guys have to say as long
as you can keep it civil about it in the
comments below or in the discussion
thread on Linus tech tips calm that you
can find linked in the video description
so you know let me know what you think
cuz I really do want to know now with
all of that said the titanium 3000 here
actually works really well in fact
switching between crossfire and SLI is
as simple as hooking up the primary card
for each of them to a single monitor
with two different inputs so I'm using
DisplayPort and DVI then changing the
primary display in the Windows display
manager
a reasonably modern monitor will
auto-detect when you switch the signal
loss from one input and then pick up the
new one at the same time I tried a
couple of different monitors in games
and the process actually worked really
seamlessly to my surprise the Nvidia
driver doesn't like to do some things
with the AMD one running in the
background like switch between single
kart and SLI which I had to do during my
benchmarking but you can force closed
CCC dot exe make whatever changes then
relaunch the AMD control panel and they
both run just fine at the same time for
most things oh yeah and one last thing
guys before everyone gets mad and points
out that AMD has said they're planning
to open mantle up to other vendors as a
standard because I was talking about it
as a proprietary thing don't worry I
know however right now today for
shoppers there's no guarantee they'll do
it and there's certainly no guarantee
that other GPU makers notably Intel
Nvidia will use it so my point still
stands gamer shopping now are making
decisions based on faith and guesses
rather than solid facts I mean its
console exclusives all over again and we
see the direction that bats headed it's
all about the games and it needs to be
not about the hardware that people
choose speaking of things that aren't
about the hardware head on over to
audible.com slash Linus to check out
their monthly audiobook subscription
plan you can get one audiobook per month
to listen to in the car or on your
smartphone or tablet when you're out and
about or really anywhere else and the
first one is absolutely free when you

board though if you're getting something
done and you don't have a ton of time
and you want something to listen to for
a few minutes so guys that's audible.com
slash Linus to learn more and anyway I
think that's pretty much it thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment as I said before letting me know
what you think needs to be done and as
always don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and other computer videos oh
actually and if you're still watching
right now I did mention the star citizen
earlier in the video we've been kind of
pimping it lately
you should definitely join our star
citizen organization so you can head
over the line of tech tips forum and
there
you link in the video description
definitely come join us we're already
bigger than reddit although that's not a
challenge to read it cuz read it's kind
of big but right now
star citizen we're winning</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
