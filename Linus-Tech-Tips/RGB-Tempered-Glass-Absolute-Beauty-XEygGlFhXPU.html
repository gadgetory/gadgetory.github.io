2016 they posed a challenge they told me
that they had seen my review of the
fantex and to evolve TG and new that I
plan to use it for my personal rig
update which is coming by the way I have
all the internal components now I'm just
waiting on a few things for the actual
mod because I want to kind of do it all
together they claimed that they had a
new case for me something that would win
me over from the evolve TG the Corsair 5
70 X that was a big statement I love the
evolve TG but they seemed genuinely
confident so I decided to give them a
chance and spoiler alert it is a
wonderful case but I'm not going to
actually spoil the big ending just yet
for that reason I will give it the same
treatment that I gave the evolve TG I'm
going to be rather hard on it but out of
love instead of hate let's begin
the Phoenix Art Tour is a full-size
minimalist designed keyboard complete
with gold-plated Cherry MX brown
switches click the link in the video
description to learn more immediately
upon setting your eyes on the 570 X
you'll likely be momentarily stunned
while the reason for your state slowly
dawns on you that glass she's got all
that glass both sides the top the front
they feature all encompassing glass
panels held on by delicately padded
bolts that are inserted into rubber
wrapped female thread points dam the top
of the case features your i/o with two
black USB 3 ports a headphone and
microphone jack and a solid power button
with white backlighting along with color
speed and mode buttons to control the
three included RGB fans that are in the
front of the case this is pretty awesome
and I like the idea here but the
follow-through not quite so much
remember I'm being hard on the case out
of love the power button LED doesn't
sync with what the fans are doing it's
just a static white LED and the same
more importantly goes with the Corsair
logo LED on the side of the power supply
basement it's not a huge deal but still
if they had all synced together through
Corsairs RGB controller it would have
added an extra layer of polish which
would have been very nice moving to the
inside of the case I understand that
they may have left the right hand side
open to facilitate the installation of
thick radiators in the front or other
water cooling components like pumps or
reservoirs I'm not a huge fan of the
move I'm trying to hide the cable mess
man not show it off again this is out of
love but where's the optional cover
piece that I could screw in from the
kind of top here most people probably
won't have anything to the right of the
motherboard there are no drive mounts or
anything like that and if you're not
doing custom water cooling then it's
probably an empty space because you'll
put your AIO in the top one that I don't
mind complete
but one that certainly would look dumb
with cables poking out of it moving to
the top of the case for a moment we have
the expected mounting points for the
easy installation of an all-in-one water
cooling radiator remove these two thumb
screws below it and just you know slide
it out nice this is a huge thing for me
enabling the user to fuss with the
installation of their radiator away from
the cumbersome case is great but what
isn't great here is the implementation
of the filter you unfortunately have to
remove the glass on the top of the case
in order to access it I think this could
have been made easier by allowing it to
slide out of the back or even maybe from
the side although that might have
required a change in how the glass works
so probably not that brings us to the
right side of the case which is a big
challenge for any glass or open style PC
enclosure so how are they hiding the
messy stuff first up here we have two
easy to use squeeze mount 2.5 inch trays
that will put your SSDs on display which
is pretty awesome
the cables need only short runs down to
the power supply area which is not bad
either the plug in location for the
corsair RGB fan power hub is just to the
left and feels like a solid compromise
between cable management and positioning
as it is centrally located meaning that
you can reach it at all which is good it
manages up to six fans the three
included SP 120 RGB fans in the front
and up to three more SP 120 RGB fans
that's right
holy those this hub is not compatible
with HD 120 RGB fans huh the hub runs up
to a control box that for most people
will do nothing
since pressing buttons on the top is a
lot easier than taking off a glass panel
just to adjust the mode or color or
speed of your fans but it can function
standalone if you take the top panel off
for some reason then we have the hard
drive trace of course they're opted to
have them sort of upside down that is
showing the bottom of the drive this
will make them easier to install and
make it so that your SATA cables don't
have to squish against the wall but it
will also leave you probably showing off
a green PCB that now I'm guessing here
probably doesn't
along with the aesthetic of your build
especially for getting a glass case not
ideal but I'd probably be standing here
complaining about the difficulty of
mounting a drive that is flat mounted
against the wall if they did it the
other way so I guess that sucks to be
Corsair there was no completely right
answer here bringing us finally to the
cable management bar when I first laid
my eyes upon this magnificent piece of
metal I was filled with excitement so
this is how they decided to solve the
cable management issue of a see-through
case brilliant in theory in practice
not entirely the sheer girth of the
cables that need to RAM up into its
passage in order to plunge through the
rubber grommets into the motherboard
compartment I think it's just more than
she can handle even with our relatively
standard setup of hardware John had to
screw it from one side while I held it
down and offered some encouragement from
the other I mean high-five for
collaboration but not everyone will have
such a good and trusted friend around
when they need to put the finishing
touches on their build leaving with
nothing left but to dive tired yet
satisfied into the conclusion the
Corsair 570 X is priced at 170 dollars
right in range with the enthu of all
Fiji whose price varies a bit based on
what color you choose and whatnot the
fight is close and honestly just comes
down to some preference differences
personally I'm going to stick with my
evolve TG but only because I already
planned my mod for it and I don't want
to make any more decisions on this rig I
don't want to decide between the two of
them I just want to get my personal rig
done the mod parts are being shipped
right now anyways what do you guys think
about 570 X let me know down below if
you aren't familiar with math shop
already there are community where users
discuss products that they're interested
in buying and then mass drop follows
that up talks to the manufacturer and
negotiates
a bulk order at a discounted price today
mass drop is featuring the Westone 30
in-ear monitors the features of these
monitors include three balanced armature
drivers 3-way crossover replaceable
braided cable that comes with five pairs
of silicone ear tips you
to give an orange waterproof carrying
case and all of that together is 249 US
dollars on mass drop check them out
thanks for watching guys this video

buy it down in the description below you
can also see where to buy some awesome
Linus tech tips or Linus Meany group
inspired shirts down there and you can
also check out the forum thread where
you can talk about how tired are
satisfied you were after viewing this
case and if you want to see another
video check it up here it is my review
