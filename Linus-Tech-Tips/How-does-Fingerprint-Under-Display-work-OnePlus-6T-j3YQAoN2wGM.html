we can all agree that the quest to
eliminate bezels and push ever closer to
that mythical 100% screen to body ratio
in a smartphone is in fact stimulating a
lot of innovation from hidden cameras
that pop up when you're using them to
using vibrating glass as your speaker
but the one feature that we have in our
hands today that seems to me at least
less like a gimmick and more like the
new paradigm moving forward is fod or
fingerprint on display with the latest
example of this technology right here on
the 60 from oneplus so they reached out
to sponsor a video all about this new
fingerprint scanning technology and how
exactly it works so let's unlock its
secrets oh no that's just
we're just unlocking the phone there's
no secrets sorry wait just hold on a
second
okay first things first
definitions ever since the first fod
prototypes showed up at CES 2018 people
have erroneously been calling them in
screen fingerprint readers but
technically speaking these
implementations are actually under
screen fingerprint readers so with an
under screen scanner like the one in the
oneplus 16
there's the glass then the AMOLED
display panel then the fingerprint
reader and in screen reader would be a
technology we don't actually have yet
where the scanner would actually be
integrated within the display panel
which would presumably allow large areas
of the screen or even the entire screen
to read your fingerprint enabling ideas
like multi finger authentication or even
continuous authentication where the
device never stops reading your
fingerprints wrote an entire session or
transaction that's really fun to think
about but let's bring it back to the
present day because even this would have
seemed pretty sci-fi a few short years
ago something that's especially
mind-boggling considering that oneplus
themselves have been experimenting with
this technology in their labs since back
in 2017 when they had actually intended
to include it in the 1 + 5 t as for why
that never happened
oneplus says the tech just wasn't ready
yet the hardware was larger taking up
precious space inside the phone and that
module actually had to be bonded on to
the screen increasing the cost and the
complexity of repairs more importantly
for the user though they felt that the
first gen scanner just wasn't fast
enough or consistent enough to ship with
a oneplus logo attached now two phone
generations later the 60 uses a newer
smaller fingerprint module from good
excessive astha stin the industry
unlocking the phone in just 0.3 6
seconds unlike the capacitive
fingerprint scanners that most of us are
used to the 60 uses an optical scanner
so the phone's display is actually used
to shine a light at your finger
apparently they got the best results
with green light and then the reflected
light that reaches the fingerprint
sensor creates an image
of your fingerprints minutiae the
distinctive ridges valleys and Forks
that comprise your unique fingerprint
the scanned image is then compared to
the fingerprint that was stored in your
snapdragon cpus trustzone which is
analogous to an iphone secure Enclave
back when you first trained your
fingerprint model self learning
algorithms helped compare your minutiae
to the saved image more quickly and if
there's a match the phone unlocks
lickety-split and now for some
rapid-fire Q&amp;amp;A from some guy is it
durable
yeah it's rated for 300,000 unlocks is
that a lot though that's about like
unlocking your phone a hundred and fifty
times a day for five years what if I
have a screen protector then that will
not affect it at all okay smart guy what
if I have a bunch of scratches or even a
crack on my screen okay now we're
getting into your mileage may vary
territory if you have a small crack then
it probably won't affect it if you have
a bigger crack then it's probably a good
idea to train the model with the crack
already there and if you have a really
big crack well then should go to the gym
well see you later
so in summary this is something that
I've been particularly amped about
because even way back when the first
phone started showing up with
fingerprint scanners on the back I've
been looking at that going wow I hate
this I hate everything about it because
I use my phone sitting on the desk in
front of me an awful lot whether it's to
browse through notifications swiped it
away
or whatever the case may be and having a
fingerprint scanner on the front allows
me to pick up my phone less which I
don't know about you guys but for me is
definitely a quality of life improvement
so being able to just go like this go
yes that's important no it's not type it
eat app and be done huge improvement
absolutely love it so thanks for
watching guys
thanks to oneplus response during this
video if you guys disliked it you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like the one
I'm wearing and our community forum
which you should totally join
doctrine this finger why did God okay
okay okay thanks some guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
