in recent years
all of them vying for the title of the
one that finally got it right so tack on
the other hand well ZOTAC has no need
for trash cans no my friends ZOTAC
brings the heat in fancy handle lists
lunchboxes last year's Magnus Ian 980
blew our socks and sandals off as a
super tiny liquid-cooled
high-end gaming PC that we thought was
pretty darn close to our vision of the
ultimate compact PC so then will this
year's en 1080 ke V already mini PC with
a substantial graphics upgrade be even
more filling let's fly though
rockettes sq+ Force FX features
pressure-sensitive qwe
a si D keys which can be configured in
three different modes for multiple
functions check it out now at the link
below
sorry so taking a good look at the new
Magnus we can see that aside from it's
totally blacked out matte aluminum
finish and an HDMI 2.0 port at the front
for VR very little has changed
externally so on the front you've still
got USB 3.1 type a and type C front
panel audio and an SDXC card slot and
then at the back we've got
identical-looking rear i/o 2 again
frustratingly lacking audio jacks making
the front panel once the only ones you
get with that said DisplayPort 1.3 and
HDMI 2.0 are both nice additions the en
1080 K actually has a total of 5 video
outputs though only four of them will
work simultaneously on the bottom we get
the same oddly ventilated panel along
with the familiar honeycombed plastic
upper panel that worked together
surprisingly well with a nice mesh that
keeps bugs and other debris from making
it into your lunch ok now I'll stop that
now because this next bit is super ear
cereal this is perhaps the most
important upgrade over last year's model
lighting effects now the Magnus logo is
illuminated and the power LED is RGB
whoa so you can use the software to
configure it for the world's smallest
dance party cuz that's actually about
the extent of the system lighting
pulling off the bottom panel then gets
us to the really fun stuff ZOTAC ships
the en 1080 K as either a completed
system or as a bare-bones so if you're
going to buy the latter pay close
attention first up we've got twin ddr4
sodium slots alongside an MDOT 2s SD
slot that thankfully supports
nvme this time around then we've got a
tool a SATA Drive rounding out our
expansion with the two and a half inch
drive of your choice then if we go
further than bare-bones builders and
painstakingly remove all of the panels
that is 25 screws not counting the feet
we get a good look at the water cooling
system complete with radiator reservoir
and custom blocks for the CPU and the
entire desktop grade mxm module GPU if
you look even closely err you can
actually see that the CPU block is way
larger than it needs to be so it's clear
then that ZOTAC is taking no chances
with vrm cooling as well as the basics
which is a great indicator of future
reliability overall we should hopefully
get great thermal results and super low
noise now let's talk first though about
what's under the water cooling for the
GPU we go from a GTX 980 4 gig all the
way up to a gtx 1088 gig graphics card
and ZOTAC decided to man up on the cpu
as well moving from a core i5 to a near
top-of-the-line core i7 7700 though it
should be noted that they are still not
allowing overclocking it is not a que
model I think we can let that slide
though for how utterly impressive it is
that ZOTAC managed to cram all of that
in here I mean to put it in perspective
at five point eight five liters that is
under half the volume of the very
impressive Corsair one that we reviewed
recently and only slightly more than the
low respect MSI Trident that uses air
cooling so then let's power it on first
there's a really annoying buzzing noise
then nothing yes my friends the default
BIOS configuration has the fan not even
spinning unless the GPU hits 50 degrees
or higher making the new Magnus much
quieter at idle than the old model the
drawback of this config is that under
synthetic load we did manage to get the
CPU to throttle because the default fan
curve sacrificed maybe too much of its
performance for silence the good news
though is that this too can be tweaked
in the BIOS and it's still quieter than
you'd expect for something so compact
alright so now the performance showdown
for comparison we dusted off its older
brother the en 980 pulled the Corsair 1
out of the mothballs and grabbed a full
sized KB Lake test bench for reference
so then we expected the test bench to be
faster given its higher turbo clocks and
higher speed memory but what we didn't
see coming was how close the en 10 ATK
would hang on it handled everything we
threw at it with flying colors including
our synthetic CPU tests where it only
really lagged behind in the real bench
image editing test it also provides a
great VR experience thanks to the
aforementioned front panel HDMI 2.0 and
USB 3.1 ports making it one dem
impressive little lunch box sorry sorry
couldn't resist
but that impressiveness doesn't change a
key point that we made in our review of
the en 980 the inability to upgrade the
CPU and GPU in the Magnus en 1080 K
seriously puts a damper on its otherwise
spectacular performance and the $17.99
us price tag yes
$200 more even than its predecessor is
for a system that will forever be as you
bought it save for maybe throwing in
some more
or storage I mean with the gtx 1018 a
core i7 7700 hdmi 2.0 DisplayPort 1.3
USB 3.1 I mean we can't see your gaming
lunch getting moldy any time soon we're
just saying that what are we saying
maybe it maybe it's this okay there's no
question that the en 1080 K is a tiny
quiet punching above its weight class
freakin incredible little piece of
technology ZOTAC did an outstanding job
once again but at these prices you just
have to ask yourself are you hungry
enough for frames to spring for this
water-cooled super meal or is it just
too much to swallow tunnel bear is so
easy to use that you can get your mom or
even your grandpa using a VPN app which
is a good idea because a VPN lets you
browse privately and enjoy a more open
Internet and tunnel bear all bad you
just download it it's available for PC
Mac Android iOS there's even a Chrome
extension and you just press like one
button and boom all your traffic gets
hidden from advertisers your ISP or
anyone who wants to profit from you or
