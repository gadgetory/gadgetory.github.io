couple people play this game so it makes
sense that there are World of Warcraft
licensed Blizzard products out there on
the market now this is a world of
warcraft wireless headset from created
you see they got their sound blaster
branding on there they've also got THX
certification for this particular unit
and that would be all very fine and
interesting but if it's not a neat
product with unique value add features
then the world of warcraft label doesn't
really do much for it especially for a
headset I mean looks something like a
WoW Mouse for example where you've got
better integration with the game as a
feature then yes that's definitely very
World of Warcraft with this we have
aesthetics but we also have some pretty
cool features that do appear to be
optimized for MMO gamers so number one
is okay there's the handset but let's do
accessories first accessories first if I
can get that board packaging yellow very
nice packaging very clean very simple
that here we have like a pleather case
that's nice okay so when you're carting
around to lens and you'll have somewhere
to keep your headset so it won't get all
dinged up and scratched up and
okay here we got more accessories sorry
guys I'm it's hard to talk while I fish
for accessories in the boxes okay I
think I got everything so you got a
QuickStart guide this is a wireless
headset so there is a little bit of
setup involved you got to charge your
headset download and install software
you also have to pair the headset with
your transmitter and then you can setup
the World of Warcraft audio control
panel and last but not least you wear
the headset okay good there's a little
list of all the included stuff but we're
going to go through that anyway so why
don't we just go ahead and do that so
first we have our carrying case thing so
let's have a look at this that's
actually a kind of a nice little nice
little add-on because I haven't really
seen any headsets that come with a
convenient way to pack them up and carry
them around so you got a little world of
warcraft logo there okay tongue blaster
logo on the other side throw your
headset in there and it does fit so they
did manage to do their due diligence you
know I've seen I've seen worse things on
products you know then a carrying case
that doesn't fit so that's that's
excellent you tested that aspect of this
headset now it looks like you can put
your your transmitter in there or maybe
that's for your no that's probably for
the detachable headset mic yeah alright
so what do we got in here I guess one of
the things we're gonna find is a
detachable mic okay so that's nice and
flexible so you can position it where
you need it to be yeah you've got
little Jack there plugs into the headset
at some point so I'll show you how that
works later uh here we have a
screwdriver so that presumably is for
the interchangeable lenses which I'll
show you in a minute here we have a
charging cable so that's just your
standard USB eight and mini whatever
that is it's a six pin it looks like 510
okay alright so let's go ahead and start
teaching the packaging off here taking
off all the protective seals and whatnot
I can't find the USB transmitter I don't
know what happened to this so you know
what give me a sec guys I'll get all
this off and then I'll find that
transmitter and I'll be back okay so we
got some safety instructions here so no
cars no motorcycles never drive or
motorcycle always take your flying
Griffin or whatever it is okay then we
have our USB transmitter here as well as
the sync key there's a little LED
indicator light looks very World of
Warcraft themed and it also comes with a
little thing to attach a lanyard or
other carrying strap plugs in by USB as
you probably figured out by now and what
I realized while I was off-camera is
that this has two pouches so I'm
guessing one for this and then one for
like this and maybe this goes in there
too so you have a way to carry not only
the headset but also the accessories you
also have an important notice here
please note Sound Blaster our World of
Warcraft our voice tap is now known as
Sound Blaster World of Warcraft a voice
tap TM okay so be very clear if you're
ever telling your friends about voice
tap you got to make sure you get the
proper pepper you know notes in there
don't want to do that one okay
speaking of voice not actually let's
talk about voice down the boy stops is
pretty cool that's one of the features
of this headset that is very very
relevant so voice tap is an optional
accessory here let's Sutton's check out
the headset itself here so right left
there you go it's gonna look a little
something like that very cushiony hold
on a second Oh cuz you can't hear it but
it sounds really like squeaky in your
ear when you push on
like that but there's a lot of air and
foam cushioning in here very very
comfortable my ears actually hardly even
make contact with the inside of the head
of the earphone in any way like whether
it's along the outer rims or on the
inside where the speaker is so that's
that's a very good feature for World of
Warcraft because you know when you're
rating or doing whatever takes a really
long time it takes a really long time
you've also got a good amount of foam
padding here on the top once that gets
broken in it's gonna definitely conform
to your head and it's going to make this
even more comfortable as time goes on
okay so here are the interchangeable
lenses so you can see there's like kind
of a lion looking dude on there now and
then here there's a little shield guy or
something I actually don't know what it
is I'm sure someone can post a comment
on the video and tell crazy Russian and
myself what what these are okay so
there's that you've also got volume
control so here's volume minus volume
plus I'm a huge fan of volume control
built right into the side of the headset
it's so convenient okay you know I can't
hear it just go like this it's awesome
compared to you actually taking your
hand off the mouse because I very much
prefer to take my hand off the keyboard
that's my left hand versus taking my
hand off the mouse for game control okay
here we've got our charging port okay
because this is Wireless remember guys
but I'm very happy to see a built-in
battery versus the other way around we
have our mic connection right there okay
we have a mic mute slash connect button
awesome
outstanding love it so the mic mute is
also built on to the left ear phone so
you can easily mute your mic and you
know like mom I'll be five minutes for
dinner or whatever it is that you need
my odd buckets okay on/off that's good
you want to preserve your battery life
and on the other side no control so this
is definitely geared for right-handed
people so left-handed people will have
to you know adjust things a little bit
but I really don't think it's the end of
the world of warcraft'
alright other features volume system
interchangeable headphones detachable
make from USB wireless
back school so you can morph your voice
into different World of Warcraft
characters and creatures with voice
effects technology that's kind of neat
and then let's talk about that tapping
thing here we go
Sound Blaster World of Warcraft voice -
oh they forgot the TM no way look at
that okay
map your push-to-talk key or a favorite
macro - the optional foot control pedal
keeping your hands-free to control the
game so that way you are able to keep
yet another Mouse binding key free to do
something else and you can just use your
foot pedal to you know cast spells or
you know what you should bind it to like
move forward right right foot pedal move
forward awesome right
okay what else do we got here the audio
control panel and I think that's pretty
much it so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the world of
warcraft TM see our headset from
