going to be unboxing a brand new sony
tablet this is a nine point four inch
tablet pc features android honeycomb and
it comes in an attractive round box that
we're going to go ahead and break the
seal on because that is what we do on
this channel we unbox things and then we
take a first look at them so here is my
first look PlayStation Certified
fascinating ok so the sony tablet this
is the S tablet device Sony upward their
little slogan here make-believe got a
picture of the tablet itself which looks
pretty slick although I would expect
that from a Sony product PlayStation
Certified we already talked about on the
side we see not a whole lot on the other
side we see not much here we see some
general specs so nine point four inch
tablet 16 gig SSD it has an SD slot and
IR blaster now that's cool dual webcams
Tegra 2 bluetooth honeycomb and it is a
tablet all right oh not a whole lot to
say for itself on the outside of the
voxel of the IR blaster is a very cool
feature because what that means is you
can use it as a remote very neat okay
quick start guide getting started harems
and turn this around so everyone can see
what we're doing here um support website
ok what's it want you to do in the box
okay well we'll see what's in the box
anyway how to charge the battery okay
and then turning on your device press
the power button for three seconds well
that is a quick start guide because
that's not gonna take very long here's
the tablet itself that is a strange
shape okay we'll get to that in a hole
injection okay that is another Quick
Start Guide press the button unlock the
thing log in to Google okay you think
they would have just put that on the
quick start guide that I guess I'll
important information FCC regulations
and safety and whatnot okay and user
License agree really Oh for certain
software for your sony tablet device ok
and then limited warranty statement so
how long is our warranty this is a
probably a one-year warranty based
that tablets are generally one-year
warranty but I'd hate to be wrong
although I am wrong sometimes okay give
me a minute here guys go ahead and found
it guys it's a one-year limited warranty
and it can be transferred to a
subsequent owner so that's kind of cool
so that's kind of like XFX is dual dual
lifetime warranty except it's not
lifetime it's one year but you can
actually sell your tablet give them your
receipt and then they will have warranty
coverage from Sony if you decide to
upgrade your tablet to something else
down the road so that's kind of neat all
right we've got a power cord got a power
brick power brick I'm just going to show
you guys the old iphone size comparison
so you can get some idea of how big it
is alright so there's that and then
there it is next to the iPhone itself so
you can kind of see how big it is not
too heavy I mean there's something to be
said for this longer cord style i mean
the samsung galaxy as well as the suits
transformer which I have here just for
size comparison both come with little
proprietary USB cables that go into like
custom dock connectors and there is
something to be said for a longer cable
like this because it means that you can
put this next to your nightstand bring
the cable up on to the nightstand and
charge it every night conveniently
rather than relying on it too rather
than relying on a USB extension cable to
get the cord to be long enough so here
is the tablet itself and the very first
thing I noticed about it was this look
at that it is not it is on a slant so I
guess the way Sony intends for you to
use it is sort of mostly one way
although it's not uncomfortable to hold
in portrait orientation either so first
thing we're going to do is I'll just
find the power button and hold it for
probably three seconds based on the
Quick Start guides indication okay there
it is it's turning on right now what
else do we have four buttons here we've
got a volume up volume down look at that
a hardware reset
which that is worth its weight in gold
because things happen from time to time
and I'm not saying anything particularly
about Sony's tablets but once in a while
I have had android tablets lock up and
fortunately on the one that locked up on
me a couple times I was able to remove
the battery in order to hard reset it
but it if I had one that didn't have a
hard reset switch and I couldn't remove
the battery I don't know what I would
have done all I would have had to wait
for the battery to die in standby mode
in order to turn the tablet back on so
that would be bad this is looks like a
speaker grill of some sort okay so let's
turn around this way so here we find
kind of a rounded textured you can see
there's little rubber no I think they're
plastic little plastic bumps on it so
that gives it a very nice feel actually
and you would be very unlikely to drop
this tablet while holding on to that
part of it here we've got a headphone
jack which is recessed back here so
you're not going to have any undue
strain on your on your cord we've also
got da da da da an SD card slot as well
as I don't know what is that some kind
of USB connector looks like a 15 pin USB
I think but guys correct me if I'm wrong
on this one tell me what that is if you
know better than I do there's another
speaker and ok give me a sec guys oat
note one more thing here is our power
connector so here's where this goes
let's see is this magnetic or what how's
this work no goes on looks like hmm oh
it's keyed so it goes in yeah I think
it's this way and I drop it there we go
so goes I'm like that so you can select
your language to begin I'm going to
select english united states because
English Canada usually isn't an option I
can set up Wi-Fi later ok pretty
responsive so far actually set up
accounts later let's see if we can just
get to the home screen really quick here
now there we go ok so gliding around
this is pretty much what I would expect
from a Tegra 2 tablet in terms of
respond
cygnus they're all pretty much the same
we can connect to the internet here
Wi-Fi actually no this one's feeling
pretty pretty darn responsive right
about now so turn on the Wi-Fi add a
Wi-Fi network nope nope apparently
that's the way to do it manually okay
give me a second here guys I'll be back
so this is cool there are actually some
teachers here that I was not aware of
that make this very unique and very
different from other Android tablets
which let's face it are fairly similar
beyond the form factor or maybe the
keyboard that they use the desktop
wallpaper they come pre-loaded with what
ports they have these are all the
differentiating factors well sony has
found a way to take that standard
Android Honeycomb software and turn it
into something very very unique so we've
got here let's have a look at the apps
that they have pre-loaded here video
unlimited reader select app social feed
remote control and video player so this
ties into a few things that we found on
the sony website which hold on gameloft
well they don't have the okay well let's
go on to the sony website and have a
look at what they have to say for
themselves here so it for playstation
games it's ereader for e-books okay
music new release movies through the
sony entertainment network it does work
as a universal remote which is very cool
that is a feature that this particular
tablet has over the other tablets that i
am aware of especially if it works well
and you can share view and transfer
personal videos and photos music to your
DLNA compatible pc TV or speakers which
is also really neat because a tablet
especially when it's only got like 16
gigs of storage on it is only as useful
as the amount of data that you can use
on it at any given time so speaking of
which unlimited entertainment gives you
access to sony music as well as videos
very very cool Swift and smooth
experience like I said we've come to
expect that from Tegra 2 and it is
PlayStation Certified so yeah you can
actually play playstation games on this
tablet using the onscreen controller and
then the obviously the screen ergonomic
design to fit
hands so what they're saying about this
particular design is that it's supposed
to feel kind of like like a rolled-up
magazine like a peeled the cover over or
an open book and it is comfortable you
know what it is comfortable I'd say it's
not quite natural to me yet given that
I've had in my hands for like a couple
minutes but it's definitely something
that I could get used to compared to the
symmetrical tablets that I am accustomed
to at this time so other than that I
don't see too much more here nothing
about the panel technology that it's
using although i can check here to see
what they have to say about that milk
they just say resolution screen sizes
they do say that the screen is using
true black technology whatever that
means I don't know what kind of panel it
is but it looks pretty good I can't
quite evaluate the brightness yet let me
just crank the brightness up and see
what I think of it after that so yeah it
looks quite vibrant the blacks are very
very deep but I haven't really seen the
whites yet okay through your content
universal remote control customized with
android market and i think that's pretty
much it i think the coolest thing about
it by a long shot is definitely the
ability to play ps1 games on the go on
your tablet which turns it into a very
awesome gaming platform because you have
not only all the android games but also
playstation games as well as a great
little media tablet so that's a that's
starting to look pretty neat to me
actually so thank you for checking out
this unboxing of the sony s tablet and
don't bar tablet s rather start and
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos okay so it
actually comes preloaded with crash
bandicoot which i have never played but
i'm trying to figure out right now how
to how to start so we can see what the
gaming experience is like pretty neat
though pretty neat
okay i paused it here we go so I can run
and jump ok so this behaves like a kind
of like an analog stick where it's not
just straight and I fell down a hole ok
so I start over cool they jump over the
crap oh I think I jumped on the crown
yep forgive me for not being very good
at this guy's sorry it's like the first
level I already died once whoa ok hold
on oh oh I jumped on the crab can I
double jump no probably not ok so there
you go guys that's the PlayStation 1
gaming experience that we can expect to
have on the sony tablet very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
