that there is actually a way easier way
to replace the thermal compound on the
GTX 580 and if I had sort of well
thought about it or been a little bit
cleverer I probably would have figured
this out but all you have to do is take
out the screws okay that holding the
plastic shroud here take those oh there
you go you can actually access the card
that easily and then if you want to
replace the thermal compound okay please
note that these are all Phillips head
screws that I have removed so far and
more Phillips head screws on the back so
you do not need a Torx screwdriver which
I ran out and bought specifically so
that I can completely take the card
apart you do not need a Torx screwdriver
in order to disassemble this card and
replace the thermal compound I mean if
you wanted to take off the unis ink that
covers the vrm in the RAM then I mean
there's nothing preventing you from
doing that if you have a Torx
screwdriver but Nvidia also brought to
my attention that there are a number of
concerns that I should be warning you
guys about if you do remove those
components so hold on let me just get
this last screw out first and then we'll
go ahead and card back over they let the
pad so it's that easy to remove it and
now you see you have total access to the
GPU but we've left the metal Unison on
so the reason for leaving the metal
yunus ink on is remember the thermal
pads that I pointed out on all of the
RAM as well as on the VRMs well the
thermal pads when the card is originally
assembled at the factory get compressed
so what that means is that they start
out thick and they end up as thin as
they get when you put on the Unison can
you put in all the screws from the back
now when you remove that and put it back
again sometimes you can run into a
situation where it's not making proper
contact or even any contact at all
especially on the voltage regulation
modules so that even though you might
not notice the problem right away can
seriously diminish the lifetime of the
product so that was the reason that
Vidia had asked me to show you guys this
alternate guide which is by the way much
easier much faster and if you don't
order own a torque screwdriver much
easier for replacing the thermal
compound that would that was it this
would also be pretty good if you wanted
to water cool your card and you just
wanted to use a GPU only block because
you can actually see here that with a
little bit of modification to the hold
down plate you could probably get like
an MC W I think ATS the current model
and MCW ad or a similar GPU only block
on there and then you'd probably have
some incidental airflow from the fan
which should be enough to keep things
sort of cool enough in the other parts
of the card yo you could actually water
cool your card fairly inexpensively
without buying a full confer block
because NVIDIA has this integrated heat
spreader built onto the entire card so
thanks for that Nvidia</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
