the unboxing because this is a fairly
straightforward unboxing that I'm sure
even he can handle so this is the
Western Digital 2 terabyte re 4 edition
hard drive and what makes it re is the
fact that it has a much much longer mean
time between failure than other drives
ok well I need to grab the knife slice
the package right there you know that
good boy good boy alright ok we're done
with the knife now I want you to grab
the hard drive oh no no need you to take
the packaging off there we go
I'll help you a little bit ok I'll help
you a little bit no go away ok ok good
play Rumble ok take the hard drive pick
it out this is the most reliable hard
drive that you can pretty much check
because Western Digital validates their
enterprise storage drives much more than
their consumer drives now their consumer
drives are perfectly reliable however
compared to some consumer drives this
enterprise drive has up to double the
mean time between failure it is
otherwise just like a regular storage
drive in that it connects via SATA power
as well as SATA 2 or SATA 3 depending on
what kind of a drive you're going for
and it's got the same kind of platter
technology in there it spins at 7,200
rpm so all that stuff's pretty
straightforward it has 64 Meg's of cache
and you can strap it to a cat to add
more storage to your cat and it is more
likely to last for a long time because
it is an enterprise-grade product so why
would you want an enterprise-grade
product I can give you a few good
examples so number one oh he's getting
mad ok he can go
thank you good boy so number one is if
it's going to be really hit a hit hard a
lot in terms of data accesses reads
writes moving the heads or basically if
it's going to be under heavy load if
it's going to be used in a 24/7
application
it's gonna be used for streaming media
or some kind of server application
you're probably better off with inari
serious drugs for example in my home
server and this is just a home server
this is not like a proper server where
I've got like about twenty drives in
there I've probably had including that
one I've probably had about ten drives
fail in the last few years here
had I been using re series drives as
opposed to like refurbished consumer
drives I wouldn't have run into that and
the reason that it gets better drives
get beat up so badly in a server
environment like that a particularly
home server is because I'm using a drive
pool which means that the data is
constantly balancing around between all
the different drives in kind of a fake
rate which means they're almost always
being accessed a little bit they never
get a break they never get you know shut
down like a consumer computer would you
know at night or over a weekend when you
go away it's running in a server
environment and it's just not the
intended use of those drives so we'll be
back in just one second so I just wanted
to look up the warranty as well so these
re drives have a five-year warranty
and to go along with their 1.2 million
hours of mean time between failure so
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and first look featuring rumbled cat and
