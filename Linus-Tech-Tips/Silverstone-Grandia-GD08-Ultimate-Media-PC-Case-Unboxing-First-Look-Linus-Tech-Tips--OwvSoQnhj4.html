take a look at this is the silverstone
Grandia series GD o 8 this is according
to silverstone an amazing home theater
server case with incredible storage and
cooling capacity that pretty much sums
it up so basically in a similar form
factor to their previous home feeder
cases and you know similar form factor
as well as similar style meaning you've
got a nice thick aluminum front bezel
you've got the slick elegant looks they
have managed to cram and you know cran
is such an inelegant word to describe
this product which isn't really fair but
to cram and up to 12 hard drives and
compatibility for an SSI that is like
uber ATX motherboard and and long
expansion slots meaning you can install
any graphics card pretty much as many
hard drives as you want and pretty much
any motherboard you want in what is
basically not much bigger than a regular
htpc case so I'm very excited to take a
look at this we actually go out a
warning right here this is a unique
product please read the included manual
before proceeding with installation so
I'm guessing they had to make some sort
of weird arrangements with the internals
all of that stuff fit with with pretty
much yet you get a zero compromises
configuration capability without without
overdoing the size you know I mean it's
one thing to design the cosmos to which
can fit pretty much anything but it's
the size of you know
you know a plane um whereas this is you
know I guess a little bit more more
thoughtful not to you know rag on the
cosmos to because it definitely has its
place we see we've got a hard packing
foam usually I prefer to see the softer
foams just because they tend to take a
bit more of a beating before they yield
however this one apparently arrived
without any difficulty it helps that
silverstone actually uses a higher
quality outside carton box than most
case manufacturers do yeah i'll show you
guys can see they use a double wall here
and then they this um this actually
improves puncture resistance just to
finish that they use on the outside as
well so it's it's less of a concern for
me with a silverstone box than it would
be with someone else you do it yeah this
is really not that big compared to
something like an LC 17 or you know like
one of their one of their staple
products that doesn't have this enormous
compatibility um sorry about that guys
battery died you know the drill so let's
start with the outside of the case
because you know silverstone is
certainly well known for elegant
beautiful cases and this is definitely
no extension extension it is an
extension of that principle and it is no
exception so you can see here we've got
just a gorgeous brushed aluminum front
now brushed aluminum is a bit of a
double-edged sword for me because i'm
always afraid to touch it because it
tends to get gunked-up if you get your
fingerprints all over it but as long as
you put it somewhere where it's going to
be relatively safe it'll look beautiful
for years to come we've got our power
and reset switches as well as our as
well as on an LED indicator on the front
we've got two five and a quarter inch
base so you can put up to a couple
different drives in here if you want two
USB 3.0 ports as well as front
headphones and microphone if you were
going to use this as like a desktop
tower on your case and it looks just
wonderful i love the finish that they
put on their cases on the side we've got
two 120 millimeter cooling fan slots
including as you can see right here
they're straight push really push go
give me a second
there we go nevermind I got it okay yes
you push it and then you take it off so
including an easily removable dan filter
that has and this is something they
explained to me at CES this year this is
apparently the most optimal baffle to
place in front of a fan in order to have
as little impact as possible on airflow
while reducing the audible noise of the
fan so there you go you can see
Silverstone spent didn't the guys I was
talking to were like yeah we spent a
really really long time on this trying
absolutely everything so there you go
that is the result of months of
engineering that baffle which apparently
will make your fans perform better and
be less noisy so you can see the 120
millimeter cooling fan slots I'm just
going to go ahead and put this back on
now you can actually screw it into place
if you want so you can see there's a
couple screw holes there or you can just
leave it slidable just like that let's
move around to the other side where we
find oh sorry it's not super heavy I was
just kind of kind of awkward so we're we
have another 120 millimeter fan so this
one you pull off including the same
baffle it doesn't include the fans by
default but I mean most people who are
going to be buying high super high-end
cases in my experience are usually
finding their own fans that they prefer
as well so there's not much benefit to
including basic fans with with a case
like this here we've got three 120
millimeter fans now this is also
compatible with 101 123 80s or six 60
millimeter fans should you so desire
something to go ahead and pull these off
yeah these just snap off so you can see
the wide variety of mounting holes that
are there on the bottom of the case you
can see we have two fans installed out
of the factory
giving you overall positive air pressure
inside the case this is one of the key
concepts that Silverstone has really
been working on over the last couple
years actually and that is positive
airflow so positive or positive air
pressure rather
positive air pressure keeps the keeps
that doesn't keep dust from accumulating
inside your case but it reduces the
amount of dust that can get into your
case because if you have negative air
pressure that is to say more exhaust
fans than intake fans what happens is
dust will tend to get sucked in places
where there aren't fans whereas if you
have more intake than exhaust it'll tend
to have just a you know a passive little
bit of airflow out of all those little
gaps in the corners of the case which
can keep dust from being sucked into
them as long as your intakes are
filtered that is on the fans that you're
using for intake otherwise it's not
helpful at all okay so on the back we've
got seven plus one configuration for PCI
slots you can use up to a fan control or
whatever else but it means we can't
support excel ATX and other boards in
spite of the wide motherboard
compatibility we've got our standard
sort of bottom mounted power supply okay
and then IO as well as two 80 millimeter
fan slots now let's go ahead and open it
up and I am very very curious to see the
inside of this especially so that I can
know what merits that special warning
about making sure you read the manual
before trying to build a system in this
case because it must be it must be
pretty complicated there I mean you know
it's probably not complicated but it
might be a little bit tricky like you
know you'll go ahead and you'll install
all your hard drives to find out that if
you install the hard drives first you
can't install your motherboard or
something like that I got a couple
vibration dampeners here so those guys
press down on the handles when you're
holding up to 12 hard drives at a time
you do need handles even when we did our
little build in the array r2 with the
Windows Home Server six hard drives and
one go is precarious you want to make
sure that you're holding it very
securely because if you drop them I mean
even if they're not dead even if they
still work you can never trust them with
your data again anyway
so those little pads hold these down in
place so that they don't cause any
vibration you can also see there's anti
vibration padding here as well just to
keep the hard drive cage here from
transferring vibrations to the top panel
other than that the case is pretty much
one solid piece so yeah if you want to
fit anything wider than standard
txon here it looks like you're going to
have to play some funny games with
removing these fans in order to get the
extra space for the motherboard it looks
like this whole mounting system thing
for it actually comes out so hold on a
second let's saw you're giving a minute
with the manual actually I'll just I'll
be able to tell you guys more about this
let me start by saying that this case is
probably one of the most confusing ones
I've encountered but it also has the
best manual I have ever encountered so
in spite of it being a black and white
manual and look how thick it is this
manual is like head and shoulders better
than any other case I've ever
encountered so it tells you there's an
installation guide and the installation
guide isn't just like how to put in a
PCI Express graphics card no no the
installation guide is step by step one
by one what order to install the
components in to make sure that
everything will fit gives you little
tips and tricks about make sure that
there's nothing interfering with this
particular spot right here while you're
putting in this thing so it shows you
all the installation guide II stuff it
explains how to use things like these
whoops
these which are used to mount a hard
drive in this little tiny gap over here
but more on that later
it also it gives you recommendations for
a bunch of different components so they
explain okay well if you're going to use
a dual here
how many case manufacturers bother to
tell this tell you this if you're going
to use a dual CPU motherboard use one
with the CPU socket in the top right
corner because that will give you better
compatibility with this case that kind
of tip is fantastic to have as an end
user and most manufacturers don't really
bother to tell you stuff like that they
expect you to figure it out on your own
but it's in here very very cool they
also tell you you know if you want to
put a high end graphics card here you're
going to have to not install hard drives
here here and here and you know just
component size limitations they have a
whole big schwack of stuff about this
make sure you use this kind of right
angle cable as opposed to this kind of
right angle cable fan configurations
what can fit according to what kind of a
motherboard you're using a 6 by 60 ml
fans is for the SSI configuration
alright
recommended coolers graphics cards what
direction the air flow should go in in
order to
optimize for your case this is this is
just like great stuff okay so let's move
on and let's actually look at the case
itself so you can pull this out with the
two handles and it'll be heavier when
there are drives in it but I want to
first explain where all the drives go so
here you can put three three and a
quarter at three and a half inch drives
these won't interfere with anything
they're just across from the power
supply so no matter what kind of
graphics cards you have or whatever
other hooha that will be just fine you
can then put another up to four here
depending on the orientation you can
turn them either this way or this way
as long as you don't have a super long
graphics card installed and if this is
for like media storage then that's
probably the kind of configuration you
go with you can then and this is awesome
put a an 8-3 to half inch drive like
over here so you actually run the static
connect a bolide sits like like this I
believe nope like this sorry guys it's
really tricky so it sits like this so
you can just barely access them and run
the cables to it and so that's eight
three and a half inch drives you can put
two two and a half inch drives oh yeah
and it uses this adapter over there so
that bolts to the side of the case which
then screws into the drive meaning it's
not sticking right up against the case
with a risk of shorting out so we've got
two two and a half inch drive bays here
and you run the cables to those up here
as well and then finally the two five
and a quarter inch bays which you can
also use to install more three and a
half inch drives or more two and a half
inch drives should you see fit so that
is up to 12 total drives just with this
innovative piece of metal so these guys
are fully dampened these ones are
partially dampened you can see there's
dampening here but they had to cut this
out so that there's space for graphics
cards and it's fully dampened up here so
you're still putting it up to four
screws per drive which is fine these are
not damp in their optical drive so
that's just fine and this guy over here
is not dampened if you really need you
know ten drives and you've already
replaced both of your five and a quarter
inch drive so the hard drives then you
can put it in there
and you'll be happy I hope with that
result because that's already kind of
ridiculous
hah frontcourt front panel connectors so
here we find pretty much standard fare
we've got our internal USB 3 and they do
include an adapter in case your
motherboard does not support USB 3 of
the N internal header just do that
alternately you can source one of those
other adapters I actually grabbed one I
don't know what I didn't fit so whatever
you can source adapters that allow you
to turn one of these into a pass-through
to the to the back of the case as well
and you can just run it through PCI slot
okay we've got our front power and reset
switches as well as power LED so that
front LED and then we've also got our
hard drive LED so two LEDs on the front
we've got our front HD audio and then
we've got pretty much just the
connectors for our fans so we include
three 120 millimeter fans although you
can install just a whack load of other
fans so I made a mistake and I said you
could install a 120 millimeter fan here
at the beginning of the video you cannot
that is a filter for the bottom of the
power supply so you can install up to
five 120 millimeter fans if you take
this guy out and then you can also do
right use where you can do this is that
part where you can do the multiple
different configurations so if you want
to do the 80s or the 60 mils depending
on what kind of a motherboard you have
in this is your standard ATX width and
your standard ATX length so you do have
to remove some of this stuff or make it
more low-profile
in order to make room for it I think the
inside is fairly self-explanatory
once you get past this which is not
self-explanatory at all but now that I
get it is actually still fairly easy to
use so you install everything in it you
install your components in here you do
like kind of a test fit where you look
at it really carefully as you as you
make your way down and then you have
successfully cramped or well Silverstone
has successfully helped you cram more
hardware than I would have even thought
possible in a small space as well
possible so whether you need dual CPUs
and you know 64 128 gigs of ram and your
media PC or not now you can thank you
for watching this unboxing and first
look on Linus tech tips and don't forget
