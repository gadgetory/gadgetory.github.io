description this year as far as I knew
coming into this Intel wasn't supposed
to have any new CPU products on display
and yet there's the commemorative like
40 year anniversary of the original 8086
CPU that we're gonna actually we found
one here on the floor we're gonna go
check that out later that thing launched
also they're giving away 8086 of them
just freaking crazy maybe we'll link the
details to that down below and then we
swung by the ROG booth again and this
was not here yesterday so they're
calling this our roadie Dominic's
Dominus Dominus 16 phase ROG
concept motherboard with some kind of
classified CPU in it and I have gone out
of my way to ask all of the Asus people
here as little as possible because as
soon as they tell me anything about this
I'm gonna be like honorbound to not say
anything because Intel is being
extremely tight-lipped about what's
going on in here and I have seen some
pretty dumb SH not the word I'm looking
for but some pretty unlikely speculation
about what exactly is going on here so
first of all let's bring up so they're
letting us run Cinebench this is this is
freaking awesome they're letting us run
Cinebench so we've got a score from last
time 6,000 points we can't bring up CPU
said but we're allowed to run Cinebench
so let's see if we can count how many
cool old crap ok it's going to be pretty
hard for us to count how many course it
has which pretty much tells me
everything that I need to know because a
lot of people wouldn't recognize this
socket but I've actually been working on
a 6 video editors one CPU project for a
while so I've got a Seuss's dual LGA 36
47 socket WS see
bored and it's got a socket that looks
an awful lot like that now we know Intel
isn't launching any new CPU
architectures right now so we can
speculate that this is probably based on
the same socket and a similar CPU to the
28 core max chips that I've been running
for that project we also know that
because there's six memory slots
it is either triple channel which would
be a total blast from the past or it is
six channel memory which again would
suggest that this is going to be very
similar to Intel's server grade xeon
platform now i was a little bit critical
of xeon w because as far as we could
tell it's basically a core i9 with ECC
memory tacked on to it for a few hundred
extra dollars and intel didn't seem like
they were going to be supporting the
high the very high-end workstation with
these server only chips is something
like that going to happen well based on
that the bottom third or so of this
board seems to be recycled from the sage
i would say that could happen and based
on their their concept grade 16 phase
power delivery system up here i would
say that they are probably going to
allow overclocking which is incredibly
exciting okay so the one thing that
they'll tell us about this other than
that it's 16 phase and that it's running
some kind of classified cpu is that this
power delivery setup up here check this
out you got to 24 pins in there's one
over there there's one down here and
then i can't actually find them all but
it would appear as though there are yeah
here they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 a combination
of for 8 pins and 2 6 pins that appear
to be designed to power the CPU socket
alone over here there's no vrm this is
just more heatsink with more fans 6
and this thing should provide up to
2,000 watts of power like 20 100 watts
or something like that okay so to put
that in context the 18 core extreme
edition core i-9 can suck back about 500
watts underwater or about a thousand
under liquid nitrogen so I wouldn't be
surprised if they were building this
thing for liquid nitrogen which might
tell us that if this is a 28 core CPU we
were to overclock it to I don't know
let's say four point something high five
gigahertz who knows it could pull as
much as a thousand watts of power that
it's like that's like thread Ripper what
thread Ripper and here it is where the
one and only dur a Tower is that how you
pronounce it dictator no I'm just
kidding Viktor power has got an 8080 6k
running on I don't know some kind of
motherboard it's covered in like
automotive shop cloth and a liquid
nitrogen pod anyway the point is they've
got it running at 7.1 gigahertz at the
moment and we've got a shot of CPU Z up
here which will tell us a totally
unrealistic speed that you might get it
running at if you're basically him and
nobody else it also tells us it's six
fours 12 threads so basically at 8700 K
and unfortunately that's pretty much all
there is to it from his testing he
figures it's about as good as a good 80
700 K not like super special bins or
anything like that and you do get a
special badge in CPU said it says 40th
anniversary but other than that this is
mostly meant to be a commemorative skew
and any rumors about soldered yhs or
anything like that seem to have been
exaggerated so I guess that's pretty
much it for random Intel CPU launches we
didn't see coming
thanks to LastPass for making our
coverage of Computex 2018 possible this
year
LastPass lets you store all your
passwords securely in your account so
that when you're traveling or using a
new machine or just logging into
something that you haven't used in a
while you don't have to go digging
through you know paper notes some
or heaven forbid you don't have to reuse
passwords because it can automatically
generate them for you when you create
your accounts LastPass also stores a lot
more than just passwords you can keep
credit card numbers passport numbers for
when you want to book a flight you can
store care card numbers for yourself or
your kids something you might need in an
emergency but don't necessarily want to
carry around with you in a physical
wallet something that can be lost and
the best part is you don't have to take

Computex 2018 coverage guys we will see
you at the next booth wool wool oh we're
gonna give them more gonna make them
