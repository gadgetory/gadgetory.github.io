awesome feedback on my last video here
Linus decided to let me take another
crack at it and this time I'll be
talking about something camera related
one of my favorite pieces of gear that
we use here every single day the meta
bow and speed booster or as Linus likes
to call it the make all my lenses better
Metron
save on select intel core i7 processors
and 730 series SSDs with instant rebates
during Valentine's week February 14th to
21st 2015 click now to learn more okay
so it's not magic what it actually is is
a focal juicer which allows your
aperture which you can learn more about
in this video on tech wiki on any lens
to be one-stop faster than it would
otherwise be possible okay we've been
through this before the video no camera
talkie mumbo jumbo you speak in plain
English okay alright alright sorry so
let me try this again the speed booster
bolts onto your camera and sits between
the camera and a compatible lens and has
three main benefits number one is that
it widens the field of view that your
camera can see by a magnification of
0.71 or 0.58 depending on the model
number two is that it adds overall
sharpness to the final image that you
get out of your camera and number three
is that it seemingly increases the
amount of light that enters your camera
but we'll get more in depth on that in a
moment
because if you're anything like me
you're probably sitting there going this
is voodoo magic it sounds way too good
to be true and honestly the first time I
read about this adapter I spent no small
amount of time making sure it wasn't an
elaborate hoax or April Fool's or
something thankfully it wasn't and all
meta bones had done was figure out how
to implement a general use focal reducer
something that no one has actually done
in the photography world let's get into
how this thing actually works typically
you have your lens in a camera body
where light enters and hits your sensor
like this but here's what happens when
you add the speed booster to the same
setup the light converges onto a smaller
field than before condensing the light
this way allows for a wider field of
view and more of the light focused onto
a smaller area effectively giving you
more usable light on your sensor for the
photographers and enthusiasts out there
this is the opposite effect that a
typical teleconverter would give you a
teleconverter would spread the light
over a larger area narrowing your field
of view and decreasing the amount of
light that is usable on the sensor
giving you a cropped in and darker
overall image now the important part to
note here is that the speed booster will
only work with cameras that have
appropriate spacing between the lens
mount and the sensor the Blackmagic
pocket or Panasonic gh4 for example
and with lenses that are designed to
cover a larger sensor size than your
camera is equipped with for example here
are three different size lens circles
each specifically made for a different
size sensor full-frame aps-c and micro
four-thirds so while the full frame lens
and the aps-c size lens will both work
on a speed booster paired with my
Blackmagic pocket camera that uses a
Micro Four Thirds mount the theoretical
pairing between a Micro Four Thirds lens
and a Micro Four Thirds camera would not
work with a speed booster this allows
general-purpose photography lenses like
this one made for a full-frame camera
like Burkle's Canon 60d SLR to not only
fit my Blackmagic camera but work even
more effectively at a speed of up to one
two thirds of a stop faster giving me
better performance in low-light outside
of the studio as well as the ability to
get a much shallower depth of field like
in this shot here now onto the last of
the main benefits of the speed booster
it's a common assumption that putting
more glass behind or in front of a lens
would lead to a loss in overall
sharpness and while this is true for
teleconverters since they magnify the
aberrations of a given lens the speed
booster actually has the opposite effect
since it compresses the original image
of the lens reducing the visibility of
these anomalies in the glass now it is
true that the glass within the speed
booster will have its own set of
aberrations but meta bones has done a
great job of specifically correcting for
this and that is how they can achieve
the seemingly impossible better image
quality with more light captured so onto
my conclusion which is one that I
already knew before I started making
this video because I've been using the
fs700 version of the speed booster since
its release over a year and a half ago
as well as the Blackmagic pocket one
since I bought it for myself about a
year ago and this is it
the reason the speed booster is one of
my favorite tools is that it offers an
immense amount of flexibility and new
possibilities with the same camera
equipment that I might already own and
while it is not always needed when
trying to shoot something far away it
actually might do more harm than good in
that situation
the same goes for if I wanted a deeper
depth of field work for macro close-up
but it does allow me to make this shot
into this shot and while I understand
there are other ways I could achieve
this nothing does it with quite the
simplicity affordability and flexibility
of the speed booster speaking of
simplicity affordability and excuse me
sir
let's channeling Brandon there for a
minute affordability and flexibility
Dollar Shave Club they deliver
high-quality razors directly to your
door and all you have to do is sign up
for the club so that's the simplicity
the affordability comes in where it's
like yeah there are only a few bucks a
month and you sign up and then well it's
affordable so it's pretty
self-explanatory and the flexibility
comes in with you you don't even have to
get razors you could get there dr.
carver shave butter you could get there
after shave you could get there one wipe
Charlies butt wipes for men so they have
all the same qualities of the speed
booster except completely different
because it's it's high-quality razors
and they come in the mail so that you
can leave the house looking like you
leave the house and you don't have to
leave the house in order to achieve that
because if you think about it it's like
a freakin paradox you have to go out to
the store to look presentable to go out
to the store how can anyone do this okay
obviously it's not quite that
complicated but Dollar Shave Club makes
life even simpler so shave time shave
money Dollar Shave Club the link is in
the video description and while you're
looking at the video description guys
they're nearby is the like button you
can like this video if you liked it you
can dislike it if you thought Brandon
sucked and you never want to see them on
camera again you can leave a comment if
your feelings are more complicated than
either of those things and we have other
