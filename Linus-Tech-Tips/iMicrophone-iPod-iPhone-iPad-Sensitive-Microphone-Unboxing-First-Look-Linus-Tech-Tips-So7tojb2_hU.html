go in your eye it goes in your eye
product so this is compatible with
iPhones iPads and iPods it performs it
can make it so that they can perform
double duty is a powerful digital voice
recorder so what look sorry guys so what
this is is an incredible high
sensitivity 3.5 millimeter 4-pole
omnidirectional condenser microphone for
the iphone ipad and ipod so pretty much
you're replacing the crummy microphone
that's built into your iDevice with this
one for a better voice pick up so a
great use for something like this would
be oh yeah I look at that they've even
got a listing I was going to say
business meetings but they've got that
on their ideal for voice recording for
example lectures interviews and business
meetings so for example you've got
speakeasy has software that allows you
to convert recorded voice messages into
text so you could use that or speak
naturally speakeasy dragons something
okay whatever someone who remembers what
the piece of software is that takes your
voice and turns it into text please
leave that in the comments bat piece of
software it's cheap it's like five bucks
for the ipod would ideally be able to
understand your voice better and convert
it to text more easily especially in the
context of a multi voice environment
like a meeting or lecturer interview
okay features incredible high
sensitivity RF shielding compact design
and premium wind screen is included okay
specifications are here so you can feel
free to pause and read that should you
so desire don't take this out when it's
too cold outside and we've also got a
list of the products it is designed for
although i suspect it would work just
fine in any microphone jacks so let's go
ahead and open this baby up what I'll
have to do for you guys is do a couple
of audio recording samples where I use
the integrated microphone on my iphone4
vs the I microphone so there's the
premium windscreen
made of foam bottle screen the win for
you also works for that all right and
this is the i microphone itself so it
has like a very solid feeling
construction to it there's the
microphone ok there's the jack here's
what it looks like if you put the
windscreen on it
oh it's like totally wearing an afro
there we go that's odd now put that in
there now your iPhone has an afro okay
I'll do the audio samples in a minute
don't forget to subscribe linus tech
tips from on boxing's reviews and other
computer videos so we tested from a
distance of about three feet on the I
microphone and besides it being a lot
louder with the I microphone versus the
integrated one the integrated microphone
actually was more clear so it seems like
we're probably using it in the wrong
application we were so close to it in a
quiet environment maybe that's not what
it's intended for so I figured what if I
go further away and do an audio test
instead so the I microphone is sitting
there on the table i can just point at
it okay and i'm going to go over here
and i'm going to say something so this
is testing the I microphone at a
distance of power for far away this is
and this is testing okay getting it
again and this is testing the integrated
microphone from a distance of however
far away I am right now okay so I'm just
going to show you guys the testing here
so this is a one audio clip that it has
both the I microphone and the integrated
microphone from a greater distance in it
this is what the I microphone
and this is testing the integrated
microphone from a distance of how far
away so you can clearly hear that the
integrated microphone does not pick up
as much sound as the I microphone
although what that does mean is it
results in a slightly more clear
sounding recording but it's all a matter
of what is your objective if your
objective is to catch more of the
ambient sound overall more sound than
yes the I microphone is far more
sensitive than the integrated mic so if
you do use your iphone ipod ipad any
kind of AI device for a substantial
amount of voice recording then something
like this might not be a bad little
pickup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
