exes at physio line of heat syncs with
the latest the performance series so
like the others it is designed for quiet
performance less than 18 decibels and
this one says Quietus noise levels just
like all the others I've already had a
look at the compact as well as the
extreme over there and we're just
waiting to do these last two so let's
have a look at the specifications here
you can pause the video and read them if
you so desire weighs about a half a
kilogram so that is about I'm roughing
this so like three quarters of a pound
or so you've got 36 millimeter heat pipe
so that is substantially less than the
extreme series cooler although it is
less expensive so these are making
direct contact with the bottom of the
CPR the top of the CPU so that means you
do get slightly better formal
performance that way it is using a
silent X fan as well as a new excuse me
a new universal mounting system now
you've got a bunch of CPU logos here
that shows all the different CPUs it can
mount on which include am too am too
plus same three LGA 775 LGA 1156 LGA
1366 and all of the CPUs that go in
those sockets and trying to get the
heatsink out let's go ahead and have a
look at the accessory package now that
I've already looked at one of the lower
end coolers and the highest end away
from this series I'm going to go ahead
and assume that this is going to be a
fairly similar load out of equipment
here although I do see one difference
already unlike its brethren this one
uses fan clips instead of the the little
rubber mounts so it's a slight
difference there then you've got a fan
speed controller which was included with
the others here am the mounting hardware
a thermal compound tube double-sided
velcro for mounting the fan controller
and you've got some mounting hardware
fries and some screws and washers and
such then you have the universal back
plate which is compatible with all the
sockets I listed before and that pretty
much does it for accessories so let's
have a look where itself ooh that's
really thin ok I can tell you right off
the bat I don't
this one quite as much as the others
although I don't know what the retail
price is going to be one thing that
appeals to me right off the bat though
this this really does is the fact that
it's shaped like a radiator I don't know
why I care about that but you can see
that what cylonix is trying to do here
is they're trying to focus all of the
cooling just like with the extreme on
the places where the fan blades are
actually going to blow on them so you
see you hold the fan here so they
haven't wasted any material they're
going ahead and they're taking all of
the cooling potential of this they're
going to dissipate a little bit of heat
with this it'll get some incidental
airflow from the fan and then basically
they're taking the middle of the CPU
they're taking the heat away from it and
they're putting it right in the way of
where the fam is going to be doing the
most air so that means not here not here
right here right in that wheelhouse so
to speak alright so let's um oh this is
interesting so they've actually got
little grommet spots on here for those
rubber mounts that they haven't included
them for some reason so we're going to
go ahead and now bar fan using a using
the click mounting system so go ahead
and just throw that on there it doesn't
have an anti-vibration mount so that's
one thing that could probably be
improved about this particular product
and let's see if I can figure out how to
use these on camera it's always fun when
I try and figure out stuff on camera
because I believe it or not it's hard I
do have something else to concentrate on
here I take a lot of flack for not
figuring things out right away on camera
but yeah it's hard it's harder than it
looks I'll tell you that much okay so
maybe that goes there and maybe this
goes here I've never liked these fan
clips i think its thermal right that
started this nonsense this doesn't seem
like you know the most intuitive user
friendly made amount things but some i
mean i guess it kind of works there we
go what's on i don't know if i did it
right but it's on there for better for
worse okay so i'm going to go ahead and
put the other pen clip on and see if
I've actually bought that right now but
you might notice as I flip the heat sink
over
is that it's not actually flat I'm just
going to make sure that it doesn't go
this way maybe it does maybe it goes
this way maybe I did it wrong hold on
that go there huh it seems to kind of
work either way so i mounted those two
different ways i think that they both
hold the fan on pretty good so whatever
okay anyway it's actually at an angle
and i'm going to go ahead and speculate
although I can't say this for certain
that the reason for that is they want to
get a little bit more incidental airflow
blowing at the MOSFET cooler so you'd
probably want to position this if you
have a typical case you'd probably want
to position it this way so that it's
blowing down a little bit towards the
coolers at the back of the back of the
motherboard here I'll show you an
example of what I mean on this is an
asuste motherboard you so you see that
mosfet cooler in there the blue and grey
one so if you position this cooler so
that it actually sits on the motherboard
this way it would blow down towards
those keeping your motherboard cooler
and hopefully keeping the components on
there more reliable and overall happier
so we've got a fan on here we have I
already talked to a lot about the
positioning of the heat pipes because
really I mean you can throw more heat
pipes of the problem but ultimately if
you don't carry the heat to somewhere
where you're going to be able to
dissipate it it's not going to do you
any good so we're going to do our
obligatory finger shot or you can see
that it's nice and flat even the
frosties heat pipes that are machined
right into the base we have our
universal hold down here we've also got
a little heat sink here for dissipating
a little bit more heat which I've seen
featured on the other coolers in this
series already we've got the the
slightly dimpled fins which I talked a
lot about in the extreme overview and
unboxing and that gives us a little bit
more surface area for slightly better
cooling compared to just a flat aluminum
fin so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the Cylon
ex-officio performance cpu heatsink</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
