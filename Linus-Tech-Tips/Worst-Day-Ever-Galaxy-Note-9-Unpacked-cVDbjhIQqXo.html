trip I've ever been on I lost my luggage
we lost all the footage from a previous
trip so instead of going home I am
actually going to be going to Ottawa
after this and then we tried to stream
our Galaxy Note 9 coverage from here at
unpacked 2018 for 45 minutes before
finally giving up but at least there's a
bright spot and the bright spot is that
the Galaxy Note 9 may very well be the
sexiest phone we have ever seen in fact
not just may very well be look if I pull
out the black one I think you've got a
perfect reflection of Brandon in there
making this officially the sexiest phone
ever right right
thumbs up for Brandon sexy please we're
gonna tell you all about it after this
message from PIAA this video is brought
to you by private Internet access
private Internet access is the VPN that
encrypts all your Internet traffic and
uses a safe protected IP to learn more
check it out now at the link in the
video description
so I had a whole bunch of plans you know
best laid plans of mice and men we were
gonna do the whole thing live I had this
I had this whole joke where I was gonna
do like our whole our old intro and I
was gonna I was gonna hold it up for for
the camera oh look look it's Blair's
tech tips intro lol you know what we're
gonna do it anyway watch you might not
know not NCIX ignore the man behind the
curtain NCIX has nothing to do with -
tech tips anymore okay so the whole
keynote started with a lot of very bold
claims and grandiose messaging seek a
life fulfilled with purpose and it
motivated to do more and the kinds of
people who they imagine a no customer
would be but of course all that does is
set very high expectations for someone
like me of this device and they've
actually managed to do an incredible job
of living up to most of it so specs run
down it's got a six point four inch
display and the first thing I noticed
about it once I got my hands on it was
that it's actually got a slightly by the
look of things slightly wider bezel than
the previous s9 plus and I actually am
fully supportive of this change because
I do find that every so occasionally
I'll have difficulty pressing something
especially when I'm reaching across the
screen and I end up interfering with my
button presses when I'm trying to type
it's got a 10 nanometer octa-core
processor this was actually very telling
one of the most interesting moments of
the keynote for me was at the very end
when their smartphone division head I
forget what his actual exact title is
and something along the lines of every
year we work to make the note the most
powerful most amazing smartphone ever
this is not easier every year frankly
speaking
and then he kind of laughed and it
unlike the entire rest of the
presentation really sounded genuine and
he goes this not easy and it really is a
great point because you can't just keep
stuffing better and better specs into a
phone every time so it's got an
octa-core processor which depending on
which region you're in might actually
mean something different so I've got my
review device here which I have already
started to load apps on and of course
the first thing was CPU said so it's
going to be some combination of dual
sourced Snapdragon 845 processors and
some variant of Exynos probably the same
thing from the s9 and the s9 plus you
can see that the Snapdragon is the one
that turbos up to 2.8 and I think the
other one maxes out at 2.7 so they're
even listing separate frequencies for
the different products depending on
which capacity you get I believe these
are all 128 gig versions you'll get
either 6 or 8 gigs of ram they're all
ip68 watcher and dust resistant I refuse
to call it waterproof
they've all got fast wireless charging
four thousand milliamp hour battery is
this is another huge change I was not
that impressed with the note eight and
one of the things that I complained
about was that I felt like Samsung was
being really conservative with the
battery capacity of it on the heels of
the note 7 fire fiasco gone is that
strategy so they've brought their
multi-point battery inspection process
to a higher capacity four thousand
milliamp hour that is a great their
messaging it has an all-day battery and
I actually believe it physically there's
not gonna be a lot of surprises here
actually really love the color choices
this year so they've got this they're
calling it copper to me it's more of
like a bronzy type color really like
this one they've got purple making a
return they're calling it lilac or
something along those lines
I like the s9 plus purple a little bit
better but this one's pretty Schmeck c2
they've got a blue and then of course
they've got a more traditional black and
most of them have matching s-pen colors
but the blue one gets this really bold
yellow color one of the things that
stood out to me about all the color
choices this year is that Samsung he
really has their own identity for colors
now they have not piggybacked on
anything that Apple is doing there's no
gold there's no red
everything here is uniquely Samsung one
of the other big physical changes is the
movement of the fingerprint sensor so
we've got tons of different options for
biometric security once again
fingerprint sensor at the back
facial reader in the forward-facing
camera as well as their iris scanner and
these two you can put together for what
they're calling intelligent scan they
spent a lot more time talking about
their vast ecosystem of other products
including mentioning things like
refrigerators as they work towards sort
of building a more connected world one
of the more connected things that I saw
demoed on stage was decks so decks has
gone from being this sort of weird
feature that doesn't make a ton of sense
to me because you have to buy this extra
accessory to something that looks very
seamless so now all you need is a USB
type-c to HDMI adapter and boom you plug
that into a display and presumably you
can connect a keyboard and mouse via
bluetooth though they didn't demo that
they demoed using the note 9 as a
touchpad that's it that's all it takes
to get a desktop experience now Android
still isn't a great desktop or laptop
experience this was particularly clear
when Razer was showing off their concept
for a phone that kind of slotted into a
laptop shell but with some work and it
does seem like we're going the right
direction that could be a great way to
take your work with you on the go of
course one of the big things they were
talking about yes yes this is exciting
was how much work you can take with you
on the gore how much stuff so with the
512 gig which is going to be 1249 us and
then it's $9.99 oops that's the wrong
thing $9.99 us for the 128 gig version
they are saying that you can have up to
a hundred whoo there it goes you can
have up to one terabyte of capacity and
a phone well I say why wait because
Samsung was saying well you know you got
to wait for Samsung's 512 gig microSD
not me I have the integral 128 gig
microSD so we're gonna do it first just
for lols I actually don't even know if
this is a 512 gig phone
it's got a Seminole yes you saw it here
first my friends that is assuming that I
can get this in here 512 gigs of microSD
going into a note 9 I can't remember to
take that with me that tastes like $400
tap here to transfer media files boom
just like that it comes up absolutely
gorgeous get more space yeah right as if
I need it last thing I really want to
spend some time on is the s-pen the
s-pen is something that I'd always
looked at as a really cool feature that
I'm not likely to use but that all
changes this time so somehow without
changing the form factor at least to my
eye I don't have a no date on me today
they have managed to cram wireless
charging Bluetooth and a battery into
this thing so now you can use it as
remote capture for taking selfies you
can use it to advance a PowerPoint
presentation and they are even opening
up the SDK I think very soon they didn't
actually give a timeline on it but
they're gonna make the SDK available to
everyone
so it'll be up to app developers how
they want to use this and I'm assuming
it was by clicking and double-clicking
but they were even able to go forward
and backward within PowerPoint that is
absolutely fantastic it charges it a
minute lasts for 90 minutes and still
has all the regular S Pen functionality
that you would expect passively without
the battery on board being charged so
this is a potential game-changer for
someone who is a reluctant S Pen or like
me the speakers are stereo now so that's
fantastic and they are AKG but it always
becomes a little bit less meaningful
when someone like Samsung says yeah
they're akj speakers but then they they
ran out and they acquired Harman which
is the parent company of AKG last year
so it probably wasn't that hard to get
the certification and I think that's
pretty much it they didn't say much
about performance specifically other
than that it's got a water carbon
cooling system which is probably fancy
branding for a heat pipe and oh yeah
right they announced the Galaxy watch
which I wasn't going to review but now I
feel like I really need to get my hands
on this thing is absolutely gorgeous
it's got LTE connectivity just like
Apple's latest generation
watch they say it lasts for three days
on battery which is a huge boon for
someone like me who's been whining about
watches not having a either always-on
displays or be good batteries since they
pretty much showed up on the market so
let me know in the comments below if
you'd like to see a dedicated video on
that also they did a Bixby smart speaker
which sure let me know if you want to
see that too so thanks for putting up
with our very late coverage here guys we
really wanted to bring this to you live
but we tried and tried and tried and I'm
only human and I'm sorry but what I'm
not sorry about is private Internet
access
P ia is the VPN service that hides your
true IP and allows you to bypass pesky
geo restrictions and censorship by
making you appear as though you are
connecting from somewhere else and we
actually got a video coming on this in
the near future you can use a VPN for
all kinds of things that you might not
think of they're not just for people who
are trying to like conceal their
identities online you can watch video
streams from another country like if you
want access to BBC and you are not
living in Great Britain and you can even
get cheaper tickets for flights if you
are pretty savvy we're gonna have a
video coming about that soon so go check
out P ia today they have over a thousand
servers in 28 countries and we'll have
them linked in the video description so
thanks for watching guys like dislike do
whatever it is that you feel is right
leave a comment don't forget to
subscribe so you don't miss any of our
videos and I'm screwing up my standard
outro we have a merch store linked in
the video description it doesn't have
shirts like this I lost my luggage so
this is the same shirt that I put on for
travel it's really comfortable that's
why I was wearing it I wanted a line of
tech tips shirt I'm broken I'm a broken
man I say nice now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
