exciting and new that it doesn't even
have proper retail packaging yet this is
the muskan ventura pro USB 3 evidently
Linus edition and NCIX rules this is a
32 gig USB 3 flash drive with specs of
the USB 3 interface fast write speeds
and really fast read speeds that is a
much can low go that is hand-drawn and
this is also a much can logo that is
hand-drawn here's a munchkin logo that
is not have drawn so I will be unboxing
this brand new product this is actually
this this some packaging was created for
me by my gyno at muskan who taped it
together and handed all of this so I
appreciate that very much this is a
pre-production sample so this drive
should be hitting the market in the near
future you can see on this side we just
see the venture pro branding as well as
the capacity on the other side we see
the muskan logo as well as the muskan
name okay here we find a blue coated
usb3 interface and then at the other end
you can see we have not only is it a
loop for attaching to a keychain or
whatever else you might want to attach
it to but it's also clear and that's
because there is a an activity LED
inside there that will light up now if
you want to store the cap somewhere it
actually clips on quite securely to the
back now you see this takes a little bit
of force to take it off but not a ton
and that's clear again so what that
means is once again you can see your
activity LED even if you have this
capped off at the back so I'll show you
guys some reeds and write speeds in just
a moment so this is going to be a quick
test of the ventura pro this is the 32
gig 1 i'm going to go ahead i'm going to
take a two gig file and i'm going to
copy it from the USB disk to my SSD hard
openal i did it wrong ok give me sec
hold on hold on keep the camera rolling
keep the camera only 30 copy here so
let's see how long a two gig file takes
and i didn't
find it so we've got to try this again
okay we'll find a more different 2 gig
file let me get my stopwatch going i
hear on my iphone utilities clock
stopwatch there we go okay reset here
okay ready and coffee here start okay so
we'll see how long the two gig file
takes man that's fast remember guys this
is a USB flash drive this is not an
external SSD or an external hard drive
oh that is lead 16 seconds for two gigs
so what is that eight seconds for a gig
so that's about 120 megabytes per second
lead okay so hold on i'm going to delete
that same file from the USB drive and
let's go ahead and we're going to now
copy it back to the USB Drive start okay
rights are a little slower but still
pretty freaking fast so we're still up
around the 90 megabytes per second mark
89-91 so to do two gigs of data took us
only 20 20 8.7 seconds once again lete
that's a gig in 15 seconds or about 80
megabytes per second very cool so don't
