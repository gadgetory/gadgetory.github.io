time but it's not every day that your
shiny new graphics card comes with a
freaking cane to find out why the zotac
980ti comes with a cane and more about
this card in general stay tuned if you
guys would like to see a video on a
strafe keyboard from Corsair then give
that like button down there call it's
been a while and it misses you
Corsair delivers real mech or nothing
with a new strafed mechanical keyboard
featuring genuine German made Cherry MX
switches click now to learn more this
graphics card is actually pretty
standard outside of its whacky cooling
setup which we will talk about in a
moment its various clock speeds have
been untouched sitting at the GPU core
base clock speed of 1025 and a boost of
eleven hundred and fourteen it's six
gigabytes of gddr5 memory is running at
seven thousand and ten megahertz which
is yet again stock that being said we'll
see what the GPU decides to do later on
with GPU boost for your standard fixins
you've got HDMI triple DisplayPort and
DVI in the i/o Department in terms of
connectivity the card connects to the
motherboard through it's fairly standard
PCI 16x Gen 3 connector power through
one eight pin and one 6 pin PCI II power
connector and two other potential
graphics cards through two available SLI
fingers on the top left hand corner the
back of the card features a beautiful
and unique backplate design which
features some kind of cool artwork so
tax branding the Arctic storm branding
logo and the phrase pushed the limit the
back plate also does a little bit of
wraparound reaching to the top of the
card on the front of the card we get
more into the cooling powerhouse that
runs this thing ZOTAC strapped on a
generous offering of three large fans a
whole whack ton of aluminum heatsink
fins and a plethora of heat pipes but
the card is barely running at a lower
temperature than the stock cooler went
under a load scenario of staring at the
Chrysler 3 skybox so what gives
well when cooling on air the heat from
the GPU has to pass through the water
block which doesn't have water in it not
exactly an ideal situation ZOTAC makes
up for this with their beastly air
cooling setup but yeah anyways next up
is that big heavy copper water block
which we were just talking about it's
been nickel-plated but how does it
perform quite well actually well enough
that under load looking at the skyrim
skybox or mean crysis 3 skybox
it's running at 54 degrees Celsius the
idle temperatures of this thing when air
cooled are 50 degrees Celsius that's a
huge improvement load it's running at 73
degrees but that's still quite solid
all this cooling adds quite a bit of
weight how did so tack handle this the
cane what the hell this thing is
ridiculous like okay cool you identified
a problem came with a solution that's
great and with certain motherboard
orientations you won't need it but the
most common motherboard orientation you
will now I prefer this idea over the
cards just drooping like crazy and
possibly having issues at this weight I
would have torn it apart for being so
freakishly droopy once installed it's
scary and they fix that problem so
high-five for that but what if I want to
install two graphics cards what if the
height of my case is kind of weird this
poll only installs one way and it's with
the bottom of it being at a fixed height
I'm sure you could mod it to work better
by drilling through the top and screwing
into the top of your case or something
and letting it hang then sawing off the
bottom but damn that's probably a
terrible idea
honestly I'm being hard on them for this
and it's a great idea I'm happy they
implemented it but it maybe could have
used some additional thought and some
additional tooling to be more friendly
to various situations now for
performance when looking at these graphs
please note that there are three
separate entries for this card depending
on whether it was tested with stock
clocks and air cooling stock clocks and
water cooling or overclocked with water
cooling performance is rather
unsurprising although I was hoping for
GPU boost to do a little bit more than
it did when it was with the added
benefit of being underwater this just
reinforces how much I'd like to test a
whole bunch of the same graphics card to
see how big of a variance GPU boost
really is it overclocked just fine and
as previously mentioned it kept its
overall load temps while overclocked at
a totally acceptable 73 degrees but it
barely beat out the g1 gaming card in
terms of overclocked performance there
may have been a little bit more
overclocking Headroom but I'm talking
maybe 10 to 15 megahertz anything above
that and the driver was crashing and
artifacting all over the freaking place
in conclusion it's an interesting card
with some fun concepts behind it the
cane is a great general idea that could
have maybe had some better
implementation procedures behind it
idea of water and air cooling a card is
great for longevity because you can use
it in your main computer and water cool
the hell out of it for now
and when you retire it later there's no
complication and you don't really need
to worry about the potential of losing
your stock cooler is you don't have to
store it anywhere because it's on the
freaking card one interesting tidbit
before I go though I found one place in
North America that sells it to be fair I
didn't look all that hard but there was
only 10 so good luck
speaking of things that are awesome ting
ting is a mobile carrier that focuses on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first and they do that in
large part by having you never speak to
a robot if you call them up you'll put
me put directly through to a person and
that's fantastic also in the realm of
fantastic you pay for only what you
actually use the average ting bill is
only 24 bucks a month per device if
you're stuck in a contract right now and
switch the ting they'll cover 25% of
your cancellation fee up to $75 head
