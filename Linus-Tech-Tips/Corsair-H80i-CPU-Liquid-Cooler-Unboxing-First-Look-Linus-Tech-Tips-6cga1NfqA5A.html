the Corsair h80
I so this is the replacement for the
Corsair h80
which is different from the H ATI in a
couple of key ways so number one is that
the H 80 is completely eyeless it has no
eyes Wow where's Jo never right but
that's what makes this channel great yes
okay moving right along what is the key
difference between the H Adi and the H
ad number one poor Sara link so Corsair
link is a software feature that Corsair
has built in to the hardware that allows
you to do all kinds of cool stuff like
monitoring your coolant temperatures
changing your fan speed cool cool stuff
and if you have other coarser components
like their ax 1200 I for example power
supply then you can monitor all kinds of
other stuff like you can monitor your
power supply temperature your rails all
kinds of neat stuff with Corsair link
fans if you have the Corsair link module
you can monitor and control your fan set
fan control curves Quick Start Guide
shows you how to do a bunch of cool
stuff like mounting it to things okay
that's important if you don't mount this
to your CPU this product will be useless
to you it is compatible with both Intel
and AMD and it has a lot of plastic
inside this stuff will kill your baby
and there is a warning all over it
plastic bags are not toys Corsair
believes in not killing babies this
message was brought to you by Corsair or
something okay this is just a bad
unboxing so far so don't worry I'm going
to clean it up um the next cool thing
about the itching the next cool thing
about the H Adi is the inclusion of a
way better mounting mechanism for
switching between Intel and AMD so check
this out all you got to do is you want
to go oh yeah I want to put like some
Intel CPUs in my system and you know you
just kind of go like this and you're all
eh
yeah making this look harder than it is
at this point in time there you go
what BAM oh it's cuz the plastic here
there you go so it's magnetic
you take the Intel retention thing you
put it on there boom done you want to be
like oh shoot no no no I got an AMD CPU
my bad my bad
BAM AMD done no problem magnetic very
cool very easy to hold things in place
you don't mean remember the emember the
original h 70 the mounting mechanism on
that thing where you had to like hold
the thing on the back and position the
thing just right and have the little
things in the little grooves and you get
to like have a third arm coming out of
your shoulder to like screw in the
screwdriver no no no we're done with
that magnetic mounting easy backplate
all the hardware you need is included
here and it's very stylish-looking
hardware I might say check out these
thumb screws those are just gorgeous see
these are the little nice finishing
touches that I appreciate LGA 2011
compatibility is provided by this these
pieces right here and then all the other
sockets are dealt with with the back
plate which has adjustable width right
here so you can do 775 1155 1156 and
1366 no big deal and then AMD is with
two couple loops and a couple of
thumbscrews it's it's complicated you
guys wouldn't understand don't worry
about it ah
the third key thing about the H 8000
this is cool look at that I think they I
think they increased the or decrease the
FB I the density looks like it okay so
this is a much more silence optimized
radiator assuming I'm not completely
incorrect and talking out of my you know
bad thing
it looks like this is a much more
silence optimized radiator which means
performance shouldn't suffer much at all
because as long as you got a nice thick
120 mil radiator they're all going to
perform pretty close once you start
pumping some airflow through them and
once you get down to lower rpms on your
fans this will pull itself away from a
denser 120 millimeter radiator so I said
the radiator was a thicker style
radiator this will perform significantly
better than something like in aged 60 or
aged 50 which has that thin radiator in
fact most of the pre down water coolers
on the market use thin rads because they
do offer better compatible
ability however the drawback for them is
that they do not perform as well okay
speaking of performance Corsair has
upgraded the coolant pipes from 1/4 inch
to 3/8 inch and they have kept these
swiveling mounts right here which give
you lots of flexibility in terms of
where you want to sort of route the
tubes and how you want to do that and
you can twist these up as much as you
want will not kink awesome awesome stuff
love to see that so the finish on it has
also changed a little bit as well also
changed as well that's totally redundant
that's totally redundant
that's totally redundant that code no
I'm just kidding okay see slick called
me on it
he brought the camera up here I could
have gotten away with it for a couple
more if you hadn't done that okay so on
the unit itself the corsair link module
is inside here as well as the pump and
the cpu block so you can see the copper
base so there spins in there and stuff
pre-applied high-quality thermal
compound and here we have a couple of
different things so we've got some
cables for this so I can show you guys
check this out so there's a USB
connector that plugs into your
motherboard that is how your cooler
interfaces with your computer and that
is how the software controls everything
next we've got this guy right here which
is a breakout cable so you can plug in
both of the fans that you want to wait
hold on yeah there you go okay so those
guys plug in here and you can actually
get an additional one if you want you
can plug in additional fans should you
so desire but it comes with two of
course there's new style fans so do that
right there so you can plug in up to two
four pin PWM fans without any additional
hoopla going on
the last thing that is a major
improvement over the original h80 is
these fans now these are slightly
downgraded versions of Corsairs
I can't find one but here's a box you'll
have to sort of imagine that there's an
SP 120 in there see there's a certain
Neela I can find ya sound like okay nope
wrong one
yeah sounds like not Mon one you got to
be kidding me here where are my SP 120 s
slick did you take them okay there's an
SP 120 okay so as people in 20s have
color change rings around them they come
with a few different rings they have
rubber mounts up here see the full like
corner is filled with rubber and I think
that's pretty much the only key
difference because the blade design is
what's most important about a fan so
these are slightly costed down because
they don't have the rubber and they
don't have the interchangeable blades
but these are way better fans than would
have been included on previous
generation Corsair liquid cooling
products they're awesome and you should
use them in push-pull on your H ad as
long as you have enough room in your
chassis otherwise you can just use one
they are pressure optimized fans so you
don't have to worry about cranking up
the RPMs in order to get great
performance out of your liquid cooling
unit and that's pretty much it what else
is there to say about it so in summary
Corsair link better fans well-designed
radiator and thicker tubes and I guess
that's actually oh yeah and the easier
retention mechanism I think that is
enough that they probably could have
called it an H 85 or an H 90 if they'd
really wanted to but who knows maybe
they're you know saving that for
something even more impressive either
