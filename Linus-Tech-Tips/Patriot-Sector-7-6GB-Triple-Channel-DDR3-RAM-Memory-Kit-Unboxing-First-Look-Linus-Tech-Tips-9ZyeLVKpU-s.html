this is Patriots sector-7 ram so it's
basically just like their sector 5 ram
except with three modules so seven is
according to patriot fifty percent more
than 5 i'm not going to begrudge than
the name because it's very cool-looking
ram it sounds cool and i think that's
what they were going for patriots
actually recently celebrated their 25
year anniversary so you can see they've
got the box marked with that they've
actually been in business since 1985
which is a pretty long time for a
computer company and that brings me to
one of the other things about this
memory they call out a lifetime warranty
lifetime warranty is pretty meaningless
from company that you can't rely on to
be around anymore so that's one of the
reasons why i would pick a company like
patriot that's been around for a very
long time provides a solid warranty
because you know that when something
actually does go wrong well in the event
that not when in the event that
something actually does go wrong the
company will probably still exist to
back you up so we've taken it out of the
shrink wrap on the outside you can see
here they've got a sticker applied this
is a pc3 12800 a ddr ram ddr3 ram kit so
that means it runs at 1600 megahertz i
believe this is the c9 kit although let
me have a look here at what yeah this is
their 999 24 kit so that's the latency
it runs that let's go ahead and get the
box opened up here so inside we'll find
a little plastic package I like the way
that's arrange that looks pretty cool so
their sector series of ram spreaders is
actually designed around taking the heat
away from the memory modules and then
taking it up to the fins at the top
where it can either be cooled by your
just your system airflow or you can
install a dedicated ram cooler above it
so let's have a look they're using a
black PCD for these particular memory
modules and they've got a shiny black
and blue sticker on the side calling out
that it is sector seven here on the side
and not all companies do this which is
really annoying but they've actually go
the part number so it makes it easy for
you to go and reference it later and
then they've got the settings for it so
999 24 one point six five volts I
appreciate that because I don't always
want to go on to the manufacturer
website to find out what a memory stick
runs that if I'm just sort of picking it
up and want to just dial it in right
away so that's that's pretty convenient
so you can see here they've got kind of
a ripple effect in the metal here that
they're using for the fins on the top so
it's going to give you a little bit more
surface area a little bit more cooling
and yeah it's another Ram unboxing so
yes it's just more ram but if you're
going for a particular look for your
build and I think these are going to go
really well with the MSI big bang xpower
that I'm going to have on my test bench
over the next little while then you know
you pick something that looks great
cools well and I mean in the case of
Patriot they offer free tech support
lifetime warranty it's pretty hard to go
wrong thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the Patriot sector 7 memory
