brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX
alright guys welcome to the dxracer
booth where we're checking out the
dxracer gaming table although that's not
even official name because this thing is
definitely a prototype another thing
again it's a prototype so the fit and
finish isn't final so don't look too
closely at the fit and finish because
some of the photos that I've seen of
their of they're like hopeful later on
prototypes are actually quite a bit
different the majority is just what this
gaming table is about and the major
features that it will have so it will
have a slanted wrist rest area at the
beginning for your typing zone it's an
interesting experience to have a slanted
down part on the desk we're not entirely
sure if I like it or not yet but I think
I'm gonna have to spend more time with
it I'm sure we will be getting a sample
of one of these later on so - or I can
do a full unexpected video on it
especially something like the experience
of a desk requires a little bit more
time than just show coverage now in
terms of additional features there's
four cable management holes there's two
like cut through the table management
holes that will drop down under the
table and then there's two along the
back which you can send cables through
the back of the table again this desk
doesn't currently have kill management
options once you're through the hole but
it will by the time it gets to you I was
talking one of the guys they're gonna
have like tracks under the table and
stuff so you can manage your cables more
cleanly now as you can probably see
there's also the dxracer banner along
the back of the desk now if your desk is
against a wall this will probably act as
like just cable management hider so if
you have a whole bunch of messy cables
it just doesn't look like a terrible
mess onto your desk but if this desk is
in an open area like it is where we are
right now it can kind of work as like a
skirt protector or this slob guy has a
hole in his jeans protector so if you're
in say an office space or an open gaming
area where someone would be able to see
in your general like crotch area of your
pants you don't have to worry about that
being in issues a lot of traditional
wooden tables would have a drop down
here this kind of skeleton frame work
table wouldn't so they tried to solve
that problem
now of course them being dxracer there's
going to be different color options on
release I know I've seen one in red and
black so far and it's going to be height
adjustable although the mechanics for
that aren't necessary
we finalize we don't know how
height-adjustable it will be but it will
be height-adjustable
and then also in terms of width there
will be larger sizes of the table as
well so if you need more gaming space or
less gaming space if you're in a tight
area you can get a different size table
alright guys I know we'll try to get one
of these samples once it's fully
released if you want to see that video
stay subscribed align a stack tips also
thank you to phantom glass star sending
us here this year and protecting our
phones while we're here and we've got a
pretty cool video from them is still in
the works but coming fairly soon also
they get a HyperX as well they've got
about a hundred thousand subscribers on
my youtube channel youtube.com slash
HyperX and they do a bunch of gaming
content so if you're interested in stuff
like dxracer you might also be
interested in them thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
