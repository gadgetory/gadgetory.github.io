this card is going to be used as a
comparison point in another video that I
guess by the time you see this will
probably already be up this is the
associate 5770 cu core and I will
explain what all that means first of all
ei means it's an Asus graphics card H is
short for HD because the seuss felt the
need to further shorten that and then
5770 is the actual model so it's a
Radeon HD 5770 cu is the sign for the
element copper and core so it has a
cooler with up to five point eight
ounces of copper rod and it runs 11%
color so it means there is a copper slug
see you in the cooler for this video
card and in theory that should help it
to run cooler it has one gig of ddr2
ports voltage tweaking and I think
that's pretty much all the su says about
it on the front of the box this is a
DirectX 11 graphics card I believe I've
already unboxed 2 5770 at one point but
I no longer have that card I needed
another 5770 this one is extremely
popular at NCIX the store that I work at
so I figured why not have a look at this
one let's see what it comes with let's
see what the card looks like and it
should be fun so let's check out the
accessories first we've got 2 molex
connectors one PCI Express
it's pin connector those are all the
same connector it's an adapter piece we
have one crossfire bridge one Evi to
HDMI of grabby nuts an HDMI to DVI
adapter so this card actually features
native HDMI so the way it achieves dual
DVI output is via that adapter which is
fine we have a VGA driver thrown-away
download the latest from the indie
website conference card multi-language
manual ok so it has a CD manual that
might not wanna throw away and speed set
up so that is evidently a QuickStart
guide in a number of different languages
okay let's have a look up the cart
itself this is big for fifty seven seven
years what a large card go ahead and
break the seal something I'm very
accustomed to here's something I'm not
accustomed to this is an anti-static bag
that actually opens from the top of the
card rather than opening lengthwise I
have never seen one that does this
before for a graphics card
oh they're using the sexy matte black
PCB look at that you know I haven't seen
that quite this nice since the XFX 8800
GT their 8800 GT s had that that nice
matte black PCB with the matte black
metal accents on it the the plastic
shroud on the Cu core cooler is also in
like a nice matte black a sous really
nailed the aesthetic of this card they
really really got it this is a dual slot
card as you can see so even though
there's nothing here the fan is dual
slot width and it does use a dual PCI
backplate this appears to be an 80
millimeter fan you can actually see the
copper slug right there and then the
radiating aluminum fins so it is not an
external exhaust card although you're
probably going to get a little bit of
incidental airflow from the fan blowing
heat out here not a ton though one thing
that's kind of weird is the the PCB
design actually looks a little bit
backwards on this guy you can see all
the power regulation circuitry is over
here where normally you'd find it next
to the power connector at the back of
the card it does use one PCIe six pin
power cable to power the card in
addition to the slot down here yeah that
is weird like look how far back on the
PCB the GPU is mounted here's your RAM
chips I'm gonna go ahead and assume that
there's another yeah there's another
four on the other side there and you've
got your one crossfire bridge right
actor piece right there like that shiny
as sous logo that's very nice
see that alright on the back we will
find as I mentioned before one DVI one
HDMI so it does support dual DVI output
remember it does do audio via HDMI like
all HD series cards it has a VGA
connector just in case you're still
running a very old monitor and it runs
off a standard PCI Express 16x interface
thank you for checking out the unboxing
that I did today of the asou see you
core version of their Radeon 5770
graphics card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
