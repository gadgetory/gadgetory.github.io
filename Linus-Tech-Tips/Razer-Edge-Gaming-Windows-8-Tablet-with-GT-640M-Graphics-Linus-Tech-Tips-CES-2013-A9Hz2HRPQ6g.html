depending on which view you go for the
first tablet truly designed for gamers
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner now
there's a number of different models
available they start at $9.99 that gets
you a core i5 with 8 gigs around the 64
gig SSD although remember guys it's a
Windows 8 tablet so in terms of actual
usable storage space you're looking at
about 32 gigs left over ok it has a GT
640 and in fact all of the models have
that the highest end model is at $14.99
gets you a 256 gig SSD as well as a core
i7 and then the one in between do I say
$14.99 mm 1449 and then there's a $12.99
model that gets you a core i7 with a 128
gig SSD so there's a pretty natural
progression here in terms of price
points the unit is capable of running as
you can see dirt showdown it is actually
gaming capable or at least as gaming
capable as a lightweight laptop with any
kind of a GT 640 M type of GPU in it in
terms of expansion they've got a whole
bunch of really cool accessories so
there are actually bundle packs where
you can get it with the controller that
you see this gentleman using right here
that fits the tablet inside of it and
then adds 2 analog sticks a d-pad as
well as buttons that you can push it
looks like there are some shoulder pads
shoulder keys up at the top as well and
we're going to get over there in a
moment anyway so here we're just running
it with the little dock station you can
see how smooth it's running actually
that I'm going to turn this away from
you so you're gonna crash for sure adds
extra expandability to the unit so you
can add three USB ports you can add HDMI
headphones microphone and this right
here is for power you can see there's
two vents on the back for cooling you've
got a volume rocker up here as well as
you know what I'm just gonna pull it
right off the dock on you here okay
power here power input here that looks
like USB 3 USB 3.0 speakers down here on
the bottom are in stereo so if you're
holding it the way you'd normally hold
it
tablet you're gonna get decent audio out
of it unlike Apple with their older iPad
speakers where it's like right under
where you hold the tablet which is
ridiculous and I would like to emphasize
that while it is capable of running
heart and look at that it goes right
away while it is capable of running
hardcore games like this guys it's not
gonna run forever on battery life we're
looking at a couple hours of battery
life if you're running an all-out 3d
title but what you're getting is the
versatility so it is a Windows 8 tablet
running GeForce GPU and Intel processor
that means you can run anything you want
on it you're not limited to plants vs.
zombies but you could still play
fountain plants versus zombies if you
wanted it's also available with a
keyboard dock and we're gonna actually
cut this and show you that in just a
moment now the keyboard docks not coming
till q3 it will make the unit a little
bit bigger I realized I didn't talk much
about the overall thickness and weight
but you can see this gentleman over here
is actually using it fairly comfortably
what would you say about the weight sir
you say it's more optimized for
something like sitting on a couch or
would you ride the bus with it that's
what I was just figuring out like
holding it up it's really difficult but
if you aim it down like it's clearly
meant for sitting on your lap or you
know you know on the couch you know it's
definitely not something you hold up
like this yeah thank you for your fair
and unbiased feedback he had no idea we
were gonna do that to him so the point
is that there will be a variety of docs
available with it this is a keyboard
dock
that's the gamepad dock they've got
expansion docks there's going to be an
expansion dock that comes that enables
more i/o and all kinds of good stuff
like that but peripherals are gonna come
out for it over time I want to actually
drift us back over to the original one
we checked out so that I can show you
guys with my trademark iPhone comparison
how thick the unit is now most Windows 8
x86 server x64 tablets are a little bit
thicker than the ARM based ones that
it's something we've come to expect this
one is thicker than those but remember
guys this has a dedicated GPU in it not
an IGP and I can actually this is cool
razor didn't tell me this but all of the
heat being generated is here these are
still cool to the touch very nice touch
because this has been sitting here
running dirt showdown which means that
if it's not hot now it's not getting hot
thank you for checking out the razor oh
shoot I forget what it's hot razor edge
check thank you for checking out the
razor edge with us don't miss any of our
