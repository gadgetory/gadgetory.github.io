going on Kano
the creative computing company that's
famous for their computer kit that lets
anyone learn how to code even kids as
young as six years old these guys
reached out to us about sponsoring a
video on the channel now we've always
thought that the kits were pretty cool
because the whole goal behind them is to
let anyone create with technology rather
than just consuming it and giving them
the skills to make technology that
improves their lives in the world around
them so the kit that they sent over
utilizes a Raspberry Pi 3 making it a
totally independent computer so you can
use Kano just as a browsing an email
machine or you can use the Kano software
to learn to code on it and of course
just what browse the Internet no that's
boring instead I've brought in a special
guest and we are going to be learning
some coding this is the K know we had
simple steps you can build it yourself
you can learn to code you can hack
minecraft that goes right on the front
of the box look at that hack minecraft
and you can make apps art and music I
know it says it's four six and up but do
you think you're a pretty smart
five-year-old hmm do you think you could
do what a six-year-old can do okay well
why don't we try it out
this is your computer's brain it's tiny
but powerful how you get it because you
actually almost had it just try that
again
there you go that's pretty cool actually
the guidebook here I think you can
install that ah ok ok you gotta look
carefully use two hands so one hand on
the brain and one hand on the light oh
are you sure you got it I think you got
some pins hanging out over the other in
there you got it
ok push it down are you down strong nice
looks like it
can you believe Kano sponsored us to sit
and do something we would do anyway
pretty cool huh huh good job only goes
one way yeah I tried both side chicken
and that is the experience of using the
USB plug the big end into the power plug
you already did that part
so what's next now grab the small and
you can tell computer oh did you just do
that yes did you jump ahead yeah all
right
Wow can you do that what's it say it
says follow the White Rabbit type C key
rabbit horn and press Enter
what's that I don't know that is a
reference that you are far too close to
get let's do it ah your very first
boring computer update oh it has a game
you can play while you update why does
Windows not have this hey let's do it
let's do it here hold on ah press J to
launch seriously how does every computer
not have a silly little game to play
well you wait for updates you got - this
would make me so happy like every time I
had to deal with this so is it harder
than the vibe yeah way harder if I was
like this as much as much as hard
compared to the dresses like this and
then we're gonna get Dark Souls
this may be this big actually you're not
allowed to play Dark Souls yet so
there's what's that I mean that and then
cancel quest and see the PAC's codex
codex no p.m. and I've never shown you
your property WASD position you know I'm
gonna be a terrible father so your
middle finger operates W and s C so so
you move it for up and down yes and then
these ones are dedicated to left and
right do you know what pong is No
it's a game who paint the board now
let's use the code blocks dragging the
boy then set them since for the
background and I go oh okay
go yeah okay start with syrups startups
start with the startups you don't need
these a little closer please
that's better okay click ah yeah I think
you click over here though startups just
one yeah okay so you gotta listen right
all right look right here grab a boy
block Dragutin okay board block
what's up boardwalk well this one's
labeled port and it's a blog so here you
want to use this one for your trackpad
and this one for your clicks okay my
mind you you got it already anyway okay
now this is the scene see and this
little see this little downward arrow
here that's called a drop down see that
so when you click it it gives you a menu
of options down below oh yeah you just
click it oh this one boom now choose a
color for the line yeah you want to
change it no okay well you have to click
it you got to pretend to change it
change yeah how just click the color
yeah and then you click the same one if
you don't want to change it
okay now you click make to run your code
this time are you gonna be ready for to
move the paddle with the arrow keys
though okay this is your I recommend
using your right hand top rate these
ones so you actually use your middle
finger and you use up and down like that
can you do that okay
enter to start so you want to try and
stop the ball oh oh oh you got it nice
now watch oh you gotta you gotta go get
ready it's coming back it's gonna bounce
off the bottom ah so you know what's
cool is do you see how the background is
the forest that you picked yes and the
lines are the red that you picked so you
know that you changed that pretty cool
huh
so that was actually super easy and
super fun I'm sure that the astute among
you have probably noticed that when I
filmed the intro and this I had a
haircut and so obviously it's not done
on the same day but that's okay minor
detail what's good about it actually
having been about a week is that my
son's been playing with Pokeno well play
he thinks he's playing but he's actually
been learning a ton and the session that
we did in there would just just barely
scratch the surface there is a ton of
stuff that you can do with it especially
when you get into the like hack
minecraft functionality so if you've got
a young person in your life that you
want to get started on the path of
learning about computer hardware and
coding or even if you're someone a
little bit older who wants a simple and
fun way to get into coding the Kano
computer kit is designed for beginners
of all ages you can learn all about it
and order one for yourself at the link
in the video description so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribe check out our
merch store and go sign up for our forum
where you can chat computer Enthusiasm
whether it's hardware or software with a
bunch of other folks just like you
