brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital we're here in the course
our suite at CES 2014 I have the
obsidian 250d which is actually been a
leaked a couple times over the last
little bit and there's been some mixed
reactions with some people saying they
love it some people saying they hate it
so we're here to let you guys make your
own call it of course has that
traditional obsidian look with the
brushed aluminum finish that first
started with the 800 d course there's
very first case you got front USB 3 you
having a five and a quarter inch bay a
full size five and a quarter inch bay
not a slimline optical or anything like
that because the idea behind this case
is that in spite of its small stature
there are no compromises it actually
reminds me of myself a little bit so on
the right-hand side you have support for
2 120 millimeter fans you can and the
spacing is correct for a radiator and
even with a Seuss's motherboards that
have those wonky raised PCB things for
the vrm you can still fit a dual rad it
just kind of cuts off one of the fans a
little bit but it's definitely still
adequate for cooling your CPU so there
you go you can put a dual radiator on
the one side you can put a 140 mm fan or
120 millimeter fan in the front you can
put a full-size power supply even an ax
1200 I with no difficulty and then cable
management okay it's not quite the
elegance of Corsairs grommet system that
they introduced with the 800 d but cable
management is taken care of by a smartly
placed fangirl I actually noticed when I
open this thing up for the first time I
was like oh it has a wire fangirl on it
I haven't seen one of those in a long
time because they're actually more
expensive than doing punched fangirls
but it's in there because the cable
management is all done in the front of
the case and they wanted to make sure
that nothing gets caught in that fan so
they include that nice little touch and
then you've also got of course support
for up to a dual-slot graphics card
that's as long as you could possibly
want an ITX motherboard so the idea is
as much performance as you could want in
an ITX form factor in fact you've even
got support for up to four two and a
half inch drives or two two and a half
inch and two three and a half inch
drives and one of the things that course
there's not talking about that much for
some reason but I think it's crazy
because in my
it's one of the smartest things about
the case is the rear loading drive bays
so you've got all that cable management
room in the front so you can actually
reach the SATA ports and then you can
actually load them in and out from the
back so you don't have to dig a bunch of
crap out of your case which is often the
problem with these ITX high performance
chassis so there you have it guys that's
the obsidian 250d and then we've also
got behind me something that is sort of
exciting this is the 730 T unfortunately
it has the misfortune of being
unfortunate enough to be pretty similar
to the 760 tea with its sexy acrylic
full acrylic side panel window thing
it's basically the same one quite a bit
less expensive but it doesn't have that
same striking expects striking
experience appearance the experience of
the appearance of the clearance of the
CPU cool anyway I don't know where I'm
going with this but the point is it's
pretty similar internally to a 750 d it
has a bit of a different look it comes
in at a lower price and there you go on
to peripherals there's a couple things
on display number one is the Raptor m45
which is an evolutionary step forward
from the m40 and features actually
enough different features I'm not even
sure why they called it an m45 because
this is a very very different mouse it
has a picsart pwm 3310 sensor so who the
devil is picsart you might be asking
well a vago is actually acquired about
six months ago so this is a
collaborative sensor project between it
was being worked on at avago and then
now picsart has taken over and it has
some interesting new features so number
one is now it is an ir mouse so that
means you can't see that glow under it
number two is the DPI has been increased
from 4,000 max to 5,000 max and number
three and this will be very important to
a lot of people is that dpi increments
are now much more granular you can go
all the way from 50 to 5,000 dpi in 50
dpi increments on this mouse in the
software and there's other
customizability as well so you can
customize things like lift distance once
it's available it's actually coming
sometime in the next couple of months so
I'm pretty excited to check it out the
last thing is that this sensor has
actually been tuned for gaming surfaces
so while the older mentality might have
been okay let's make it work on you know
hance or mules or whatever surface you
might happen to want to put it on most
gamers who are spending you know sixty
seventy eighty dollars however much on a
mouse probably have a twenty-dollar
cloth mousepad at the very least so we
might as well just make it optimized for
that in the first place it has the same
m40 features that i personally quite
like which is the very lightweight
construction but with an adjustable
weight system the weighted scroll wheel
i think they call it the high mass
scroll wheel but what they're trying to
say is it's made of metal and it has a
nice rubber finish on it as well as a
nice soft touch finish and of course are
led the next one speaking of leds is the
raptor k40 anti chord for this is a
little bit on the shorter side so i'm
going to go ahead and move and like sit
on this table or something this is kind
of a hybrid of the of the k-30 and the
k-50 so unlike the k-50 it doesn't have
as many macro keys but unlike the k-30
it now has full RGB backlighting and
that's at an eighty dollar price point
so it's a membrane keyboard yes it's
eighty dollars yes and I understand you
can buy mechanical keyboard for eighty
dollars but if you want RGB backlighting
which personally I don't really care
about unless it's on a mechanical
keyboard more on that soon anyway if you
want RGB backlighting and you're okay
with membrane then this looks like it
should be a pretty compelling option
don't miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
here guys remember our trip to the show
was brought to you by NCI XCOM your
source for great technology selection
and surface and of course surface
service and of course they are my bros I
worked there for a long time and
everyone there they're awesome and we
also have two other sponsors number one
is Corsair and number two not in any
particular order as Western Digital big
thanks to those guys for allowing us to
be here as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
