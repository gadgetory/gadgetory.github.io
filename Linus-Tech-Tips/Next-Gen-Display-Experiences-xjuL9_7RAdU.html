for AMD's Polaris ten and eleven powered
rx 484 70 and 460 graphics cards but the
subject of today's video is actually not
the graphics cards but rather the
next-generation display experiences that
they're going to enable so inside there
are going to be some things I've seen
before
5k monitors free sync and high dynamic
range or HDR but there are also gonna be
some things I have never seen before
single cable 5k free sync over HDMI and
finally HDR on the PC let's go have a
look
so demo number one this is a 5k 60 Hertz
display in fact it's one I've seen
before that gorgeous one from Dell
running off of a single DisplayPort
cable coming out of the PC so how did
they achieve that well that's a great
question DisplayPort 1.3 has 87% more
bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.2 which was
the previous standard that required two
cables coming out of the computer so you
can see because there aren't actually
any 5k display for one point three
monitors yet they're using this
fantastic cardboard box to take the
single DP 1.3 and have it come out as 2
DP 1.2 s
but the point is that the card the
polaris card supports it and this is
with no physical connector chain
although to be clear DisplayPort 1.3 can
run off of a USB type-c connector now
there's more that is going to be great
about this than just 5k displays it's
not applicable to everyone you're gonna
be able to run to 4k 60 Hertz displays
off of a single cable using MST you're
gonna be able to achieve higher refresh
rates so we're talking 240 Hertz 1080p
monitors or even 1440p monitors in SDR
we're gonna be talking 4k 120 Hertz
displays which is gonna help a lot by
the way with adaptive refresh rate 4k
monitors giving them a much broader
window current ones are limited to about
40 to 60 Hertz for free sync whereas
nuumber ones are gonna be able to go
anywhere from 30 all the way up to 120
Hertz giving a much smoother gaming
experience BAM
but that's not the only thing that's new
with free sync behind me here I was in
theory going to have an AMD GPU running
hdmi 2.0 for the first time that I'd
ever seen one do it and running free
sync over HDMI but unfortunately they
apparently don't have any of those
monitors here but I'll tell you guys
about it any
because this is pretty freakin big stuff
the HDMI spec actually does not include
any variable refresh rate provisions so
AMD ran out and built their own
extension to HDMI to that allows
variable refresh rate over HDMI and the
cool thing about this is it is not a
walled garden and AMD would allow the
HDMI form to go ahead and adopt their
standard if they want or create their
own that just kind of runs completely
independently pretty freakin cool now
there are competing solutions to free
sync variable refresh rate gaming that
you've probably heard of the Itchy sync
sorry I've got a little bit sick as you
guys have probably noticed and we had
seen it running over HDMI in the past
but only kind of in a you know dark
corner of a demo room somewhere this is
official now there is more limited
resolution and framerate support
compared to DisplayPort 1.3 but that's
just a function of the lower bandwidth
of HDMI 2.0 still a heck of a lot better
than a kick in the nuts if you know what
I mean
and here's the other kicker there are 28
displays why none of them could be here
I don't know but there are 28 displays
out there supporting HDMI free sync
already our third demo by contrast haha
this will be funny in a minute does not
have a ton of monitor support yet behind
me we have HDR content running on a TV
and on a monitor off of a Polaris GPU
now this is not your Grandpa's HD are
running on half-life Lost Coast where
it's all in engine this is more of an
HDR ecosystem that involves hardware on
the card hardware on the TV and a
software layer so what is HDR then in a
nutshell HDR delivers more colors which
as panel technology catches up in the
future will allow us to take advantage
of the entire rec 2020 color space but
and perhaps more importantly it delivers
more contrast so what that means is that
HDR panels are much brighter that
doesn't mean that it's just gonna like
blast light into your face though it
means that the brightest parts of the
scene whether it's a star or whether
it's a
candle on a bedside table are going to
have more detail present in them without
affecting the detail that's also present
in the shadows so gone hopefully will be
the days of things like Ben Q's black
equalizer which just you know cranks the
gamma on the monitor so you can see
details in the shadows this is a much
more natural way to view content whether
it's games or whether it's movies and
the really cool thing here is in the
demos behind me you see an HDR certified
TV running HDR content you see some
monitor that has the HDR content running
on it and it is mapped to take best
advantage of it and then over there to
the right you've got just a non HDR
monitor that's using reinhardt tone
mapping to an SDR display for HDR
content deliver the best possible
experience that that one can that's what
it's all about the best experience that
can be delivered depending on the
hardware that's present AMD is doing a
giveaway they're given away one Polaris
ten graphics card and one Polaris 11
graphics card and to keep it really
simple I'm not gonna stand here and talk
for ten minutes about how you enter to
win all you gotta do is check out the
link in the video description for a
chance to have a brand new shiny
AMD graphics card so go do it now have
all these display inputs we talked about
outputs so that was the next-generation
display demos from the demo room here at
AMD's Polaris tech day I hope you guys
enjoyed it but if you didn't well hey
you know what to do be a hater like this
guy yeah that's right you walk away but
if you did like it hit that like button
get subscribed me to even consider
supporting us my cool shirt like this at
the link in the video description you
can join our forum at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys and we will see you again next time
there's a big tech day this is basically
the only way I can talk right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
