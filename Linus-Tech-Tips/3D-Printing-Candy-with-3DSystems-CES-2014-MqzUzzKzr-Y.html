brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here in
the 3d printing section checking out 3d
systems and their food printers so this
can print chocolate and sugar stuff
which is insane and I'm here with Liz to
tell us more about it so what keep tell
me more generally about your guyses
printer yeah so 3d systems is really
excited to unveil at CES this week the
first food-safe 3d printers the chef jet
and the chef jet pro so these printers
were super excited they work with a
bunch of different recipes like you said
sugar and candy and a bunch of different
flavors and chocolate and they're fully
certified to go right in the kitchen
along with your oven and your microwave
and all that and they can 3d print
awesome geometries to go on cakes really
cool ornate wedding cake toppers
everything from that down to custom
sugar cubes to sweeten your coffee and
little personalized candies and anything
in between and really anything you can
imagine and we're really excited about
this because it's totally new territory
for 3d printing right so it it opens it
up to folks who maybe wouldn't be able
to engage in the technology otherwise
and that's really exciting to us and we
can't wait to see what these these
pastry chefs and bakers do once they get
their hands on this I think it's gonna
be really cool seriously because looking
at what you guys have here a lot of it
looks like building block platforms so
like if someone wanted to make it like
you just said a pastry or something like
that they could 3d print the base or
something and then build on top of that
and even if you don't want to do that if
you just want to go with the 3d printing
style there's some really intricate
stuff my favorite thing is the the
hollow cube and you linked them together
that's insane that you guys are able to
do that so so with with the plastic
printers you have rolls of filament how
do you how do you get like is it like a
canister of powder or how does that work
exactly so it'll be either we haven't
quite developed it yet because these are
prototypes and they'll be available in
the second half of this year the
delivery system of the dry materials
hasn't been quite ly quite worked out
yet but it'll be a dry material so you
might pour some into a bin or you might
have kind of a canister type situation
but it'll be a dry Ramat area
a wet raw material they'll add to the
dry yeah and then is this something you
can mix on your own or is it something
they would order from you guys or how
does that work right it's something we
would provide because the material would
be really dialed in to work very well
with the machine so we get consistent
print quality every time awesome thanks
a lot if you want to see all of our CES
