V in Titan V isn't a Roman numeral there
have actually been six Titans now making
this one number seven instead it
directly signifies the Volta
architecture that this card is based on
and to further drive home the point that
it is not a gaming oriented card NVIDIA
has decided to forego the GeForce GTX in
the product name not that we won't game
on it of course after I tell you guys
about iFixit there protec toolkit gives
you the tools you need to tackle any
electronics repair challenge visit
ifixit.com forward slash linus at the
link below to learn more
so to help manage overhead our test
setup is a little different this time
around
we're gonna be testing our productivity
and our gaming loads on our z 270 bench
for its fast per thread performance
while we'll be doing our scientific
testing on our X 299 bench where those
workloads are more likely to benefit
from the extra CPU cores let's kick
things off then with the boring sciency
stuff I'm just kidding so Titan V
manages a higher 97th percentile
framerate in Deus Ex mankind divided
then the second place Titan X pees in
DirectX 11 mode then it continues the
curb stomping in DirectX 12 Middle Earth
shadow of war also sees a huge spike in
performance over the Titan XP and while
Assassin's Creed origins dials things
back a little the Titan VIII still ends
up on top so I don't even really need to
say it but given these scores and our
synthetic results Titan VIII is right
now hands down the fastest card on the
market for gaming and it isn't even
supposed to be what sets this Titan
apart is its FP 16 and FP 64 performance
along with the inclusion of invidious
new tensor cores which are special
compute units that are optimized for
deep learning and AI oh and while we're
at it Nvidia is also showing off
HBM to memory for the first time in a
Titan so V does end up with a smaller
frame buffer than the Vega workstation
cards or the HBM 2 equipped Quadro GP
100 but it may end up making up for that
through sheer brute force its whopping
5120 cuda cores should make it the
fastest part available for compute
should but when we first took the
shrink-wrap off and loaded up some
compute benchmarks we actually found
that many cuda focused tasks simply
wouldn't run well it turns out that
while previous gen
raishin cards were built around CUDA
compatibility version 6.1 and earlier
Volta and by extension the Titan V bumps
this up to 7.0 and new compute kernels
need to be compiled to support it so
blender most coin mining algorithms and
other tests were affected with users
reporting even more incompatibilities
that we didn't see oh I'm getting
flashbacks to the Vega frontier edition
thankfully the open CL layer still works
though so we can get rough numbers for
benchmarks that support Nvidia cards in
open CL mode with the caveat that open
CL does have some overhead compared to
CUDA starting off with Lux mark we've
got Wow are these numbers even right Lux
mark is super parallelized so those
extra CUDA cores pulled double the
performance of the Titan XP and far
higher than even the Quadro GP 100 Chaos
groups render sweet v-ray brings us
another win for the Titan v shaving a
cool three seconds off the GP 100 in
second place
moving on to compu bench we see the gap
close for the level set segmentation
benchmarks but then the Titan V pulls
way out ahead in the computer vision
optical flow benchmark leaving
everything else well in the dust and it
continues to assert its dominance in
most of spec view Perth where 3ds max
CATIA maya energy and showcase all have
it at the top but it should be noted
that the quad rose do fire back in some
of the other tests
thanks to their enhanced driver code
paths as for coin mining well the rumors
are true it is a beast especially an
eighth hash but with that said the
$3,000 price tag is going to kill your
ROI time and it doesn't even win in
every scenario Vega frontier handily
outperforms it in Kryptonite whoa that's
a lot of testing and it looks like Volta
is mostly living up to its promises so
far but we've got
one more test up our sleeves for its
compute performance deep learning using
imagenet 12 on caf2 Titan V managed a
significant lead at both tested batch
size thanks to its tensor course but
maybe even more interestingly it even
wins without them enabled against the GP
100 a truly monstrous feat because for
context you guys that card is still
almost triple the price well ok then
line is fine Volta is great for compute
big whoop what does that mean for me
okay I'll get to that first we need to
talk about thermals and power because
this bit is really important while Titan
V manages to throttle a bit harder than
the GP 100 and the GTX 10 atti in our
testing and while it has the second
highest idle power draw in our entire
test lineup thanks at least partially to
Nvidia using TSM C's 12 nanometer
manufacturing process it's also got the
lowest full load power draw which is
bonkers considering everything we know
about its overall performance so then
back to your question what this means
for you is that the slightly cut down
and maybe higher clocked enthusiasts
consumer variants without any tensor
course are going to be mind-bogglingly
fast but that's a conversation for
another day here and now what we have is
a quadrille killer at a third of the
price for most workloads and one that
can game faster than anything that's
ever come before it
though I'm not saying you should go out
and buy one if raw horsepower for
compute is your jam and you won't
benefit from a bigger frame buffer or
multi GPU with envy link these
connectors they're dead you're looking
at your next card right here though
you'll need to roll your own CUDA
kernels or wait until compatibility
level seven is mainstream by which time
there will probably be a Quadro variant
as for the gamers well the lack of
g-force and the branding says it all
is just not worth it even for you mr.
worm is meghamala over there I mean do
you really want something that's not
even SLI compatible anyway so you have
to run a single card in your system like
some kind of a peasant so think of the V
not as something to buy but as more of a
teaser for what may come in 2018 I know
that I'm feeling sufficiently teased
right about now speaking of teasing
fresh books they don't tease they give
you the whole thing it's the small
business accounting software that's
custom-built for how you want to work if
you're a freelancer or a small business
owner fresh books is a simple way to be

professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds you can set up online
payments with just a couple of clicks to
get paid up to four days faster you can
see when your client has seen your
invoice to put an end to the guessing
games and they've got fully featured
apps for iOS and Android so you can take
all of your timesheet tracking and
expense tracking with you on the go for
an unrestricted 30-day free trial just

tips will have that linked below and
enter Linus tech tips into how you heard
about us section so thanks for watching
guys this video sucked you know what to
do but awesome get subscribe hit that
like button or maybe check out where to
buy this stuff we featured at the link
in the video description we should just
sell ours what are we gonna do with this
making this video anyway also linked in
the video description is our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one and
our community forum which you should
totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
