action can FR but if we're being honest
we could kind of expect that at this
point right it's kind of like this
iPhone 8 plus right here if it isn't the
best iPhone that they've made yet
wouldn't they just throw it in a bin
where it belongs and keep selling seven
pluses so the question is just how much
better is the hero six black compared to
last year's hero five black and that
this price for something that is just a
camera how much better is it than this
and is it also better than our sponsors
Oh tax product the Magnus en 1070 a
compact high performance gaming machine
well if you're looking for a camera
maybe but if you're looking for a high
performance gaming machine probably not
check it out at the link below
so the hero six black has nearly the
exact same body as the hero five meaning
that it is waterproof without an
external enclosure it works with the
same accessories including the Karma
grip and drone and it has the same 12 20
milliamp hour batteries and USB type-c
charging port GoPros companion app
remains an option for remote control and
monitoring but like with the euro 5 you
don't have to use it anymore because the
integrated 51 millimeter touchscreen
makes it super easy to adjust settings
like shutter speed white balance ISO and
beep volume and to review your footage
in the field as long as you aren't
underwater at the time with that said
once you've dialed in your favorite
settings I think you'll probably give
most of your commands to the hero 6
black by voice and I know I know it's
everybody's favorite gimmick right now
along with AI but think about it it
actually makes way more sense here than
it does on most devices if your camera
is mounted to your head and your hands
are full of you know sports balls and
athletic peripherals you have no easy
way of knowing whether the camera is
recording or even what mode it's in but
that doesn't matter with voice commands
because it will actually change from
photo mode to video when I say gopro
start recording so yeah I know
voice operation was introduced on the
hero 5 black but it's also been expanded
here in a couple of meaningful ways
including the ability to turn the camera
off and up to eight hours later back on
which is theoretically awesome for
saving battery gopro turn on gopro turn
on as long as you can get it to work
reliably ok then - that's great how
about something that the five didn't
have sure while it might not look new on
the outside instead of using a
commercially available processor from
Amborella like just about every other
action cam on the market under the hood
of the hero 6 black we find something
really special a brand new custom
process
sir called the GP one cool name by the
way you guys I wonder what that stands
for so this new chip has double the
processing power boosting nearly all of
the camera's capabilities allowing it to
record at higher bit rates capture
higher dynamic range videos and even HDR
stills and perform electronic image
stabilization along more axes but most
of that stuff doesn't actually even make
it to the bold print on the front of the
box there the focus is on the framerate
4k video at 60 frames per second up from
30 last gen and 1080p video at 240
frames per second for some wicked slo-mo
up from 120 on the last gen videos
recorded at these high frame rates use
the new h.265 a TVC codec while the rest
used garden-variety h.264 it also has a
new recording format called 4k 4 by 3 or
about 4000 by 3000 pixels and it can do
this at up to 30 frames per second this
mostly adds vertical space to the
recording and the purpose is to help the
editor ensure that the action isn't
getting cut off at the top or bottom of
the frame if the camera gets
accidentally misaligned while you're
running around out there on the subject
of framing you can also zoom now sort of
hero 6 black has a linear slider now for
digital zoom though you cannot adjust it
while you're recording so I would think
of this as more like an infinite number
of field of view options and indeed the
old narrow and medium field of view
modes are no longer with us finally the
new photo burst mode called auto takes
up to 30 photos per second but can
actually take fewer if it thinks that
each shot requires more exposure time
which all sounds nice but bearing in
mind that the hero 5 black was only $400
when it launched just a year ago is this
refresh really worth the $500 price tag
I mean we are getting close to flagship
smartphone territory and come to think
of it on top of everything else
the iPhone 8 can take 4k video at 60fps
to them is there any point buying this
thing at all side by side you can see
that video quality between the two is
actually pretty comparable though keep
in mind that it is not exactly an apples
to apples comparison given that the hero
is wide-angle and the iPhone 8 plus has
a more conventional lens and a telephoto
lens on its two discreet sensors the
hero 6 also lacks image stabilization at
4k 60 while the iPhone 8 has optical
image stabilization all the time with
that said when shooting at 4k 30 where
the hero 6 blacks electronic image
stabilization actually works it does
work really well now obviously though
these cameras are very different gopro
products are rugged have an ecosystem of
accessories that have given them their
reputation as the fremo action camera
brand and even if you go out and get a
gimbal for your iPhone or you put tape
it to your forehead like I did last week
you're still not going to get the
immersive first-person experience that
GoPros wide-angle lens delivers so does
the fact then that the hero 6 black is
arguably the best action cam ever made
mean that you should run out and buy it
well if it were two hundred and
forty-nine dollars that I would say hell
yeah man but and this actually seems
intentional GoPro has priced it out of
the range of you know your casual music
festival attendee and closer to the
prosumer threshold where the target
buyer for this probably makes some money
maybe even to attract sponsors for their
downhill racing err motocross or
whatever with epic action cam footage
this strategy shift will probably result
in fewer units sold but let's face it
that was happening anyway and at least
this way GoPro can make up for it with
higher margins from the people who can
more easily justify the higher price tag
speaking of higher price tags don't you
hate it when you
go to the grocery store to save money by
making your own food and you end up
buying stuff that you never end up using
and it goes to waste and then you're
