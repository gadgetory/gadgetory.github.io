coverage I thought you know what what's
one of the big problems people have with
all the current generation graphics
cards wait if you're shipping a system
or even if you're installing your system
in one place but then you have to move
it somewhere else all of this weight
hanging off the PCI Express slot and
then the one little screw at the back
could be a little bit of a problem so I
thought I'd take the 480 because it has
such a beefy cooling system and compare
the weight to a couple other
top-of-the-range cards on the market so
why don't we start with the GTX 480 I'm
gonna put it on my little scale here and
I'll hold this up for you to see so this
is a 2-pound graphics card that is all 2
pounds all right so then why don't I
compare it to the 1570 because I know at
NCIX we've been having a little bit of
trouble shipping systems with with these
radio on 5000 series graphics cards so
this is also a 2 pound graphics card so
it's quite possible that our assembly
Department will need to ship your system
if you have a GTX 480 in it they'll may
need to ship it separately and then have
you install it yourself so I'll make a
point of doing an installation video for
the GTX 480 in the next little while but
just to get that point of reference why
don't we take the biggest bad boy of a
of a graphics card out there this is the
GT a GTX HD 59 70 and let's throw that
on the scale for comparison so this is a
2.6 pound graphics card that is uh about
30% more than either of those other two
graphics cards but it also has 200
percent more GPUs on it so you got to
kind of go easy on it there so thank you
for checking out my quick video on the
weight of the GTX 480</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
