zone app it's available on Android and
iOS and it's got things like news
giveaways gaming staff all kinds of
interesting things I think mostly the
giveaways are going to be what drive
most people to download it but check it
out VIP tech zone welcome to day one of
my Android I switch so let's start with
the actual phone itself the screen is
extremely accurate so if you're trying
to do something like make a correction
to a URL there's a pretty good chance
that I can get it even with my thumb
this is also something that I love about
Android compared to iOS and Windows
Phone you don't have to use the accurate
cursor here you can usually go okay I'm
gonna try and get it here and it'll at
least give you a shot at it before it
gives you the option to correct what
you've done so the screen is very
accurate which makes that actually work
a lot of the time the stock keyboard
layout does feel a little bit weird look
look what they've done here so these
middle keys are actually wider and I
understand why that is because if you
have small hands they're gonna be easier
to reach in the middle but it does make
typing on it a little bit awkward
because I expect the keys to be the same
size
I also expect these two bezels to be the
same so what I found myself doing
sometimes is sort of typing on one side
of the keyboard and missing things like
the left shift it's not the end of the
world and I'll just get a download XT
board apps such as Swift key or swipe I
think are two of the popular ones no
matter what you want to play playback
they can get extremely loud with no
distortion they weren't quite as loud as
a Diesel's Galaxy Note 2 but definitely
loud enough that you could actually be
doing something and listening to it and
then over something else so check this
out
so for contrast this is me talking in a
normal conversational voice with Big
Buck Bunny running in the background so
which is easy to hear as someone talking
to you from you know like a foot away a
next NFC is a huge plus so I've already
used it a couple times I would have
liked to see wireless charging
I hate microUSB I think I'm well
documented as being a hater of microUSB
it's an extremely fragile connection and
I wish it would just die but it seems to
have just become a standard for some
reason when mini be like there's no
reason you couldn't have put a mini B
here I'm not convinced micro USB
actually improves the slimness of
devices battery wise I've had a lot of
people ask me about this so check this
out I've been using this all day this is
day one it's midnight is after midnight
now I watched at least 3 hours of videos
on the phone whether with headphones or
with speakers throughout the day I've
made some calls I've done some tweets
I've used it the way I would in a pretty
heavy workload day this is a weekend so
while I didn't make as many calls I was
definitely streaming video over it much
more often I am extremely impressed
compared to my older iPhone 4 which in
its defense was a little bit on the
older side this is way more usable and
compared to the HTC 8x running Windows
Phone streaming video using Amit which
is the app that I've got as my
replacement for air video so using em it
is much less demanding on the phone and
on the battery life than the Windows
Phone equivalent which I can't remember
the name of for the life of me so Amit
is something I would consider to be
actually a suitable replacement for air
video it starts up extremely quickly I'm
not going to play this back because I'm
worried about any kind of copyright
infringement on the video but there you
go it starts very quickly very
responsive you have to run a server app
on a computer in the household but
awesome so I figure I could get through
two light days with this no problem
which is exciting however I'm not using
4G because this isn't 4G in my area yet
hopefully I'll be swapping it out at
some point and I'm not using wireless AC
with that said it's pretty sweet that it
supports wireless AC because Anandtech
actually posted an article on this
saying they got up to 275 megabit tested
not theoretical on this phone using
Wireless they
so I have an AC router in the mail on
the way to me and hopefully I'll be able
to update you guys on that sometime soon
the auto rotates a little bit
hyperactive so this has been this has
been bothering me a little bit so let's
say I wanted to reply to a tweet
normally I would I'd go okay maybe I'm
you know laying doing something watch
how quickly it auto rotates and there it
goes
so I'm actually oh I'm only halfway
between horizontal and vertical and it's
Auto rotated already which for some
people maybe this seems like a fairly
small complaint and it actually is it's
a beautiful phone there's no way I'm
going back to the iPhone for after this
having spent only a day with it so far
but I wish it was a little bit more like
yeah I want you to rotate then then it
would rotate versus I'm halfway and
between like I have with the iPhone 4
you could kind of go ya know do this and
then you could kind of play with it a
little bit and get it closer you could
kind of use it also I wish that like
TouchWiz I wish that HTC's interface had
a quick auto rotate here however there's
got to be an app for that or something
screens amazing the viewing angles
outstanding here I'll just give you guys
like a browser page to look at or maybe
like here's a here let's play back in
unboxing you guys can see what it looks
like ok
speakers are loud so you can see what it
looks like ahead on and then you can see
what it looks like from the side there's
no color shift it uses Super LCD 3 so
you don't get any of that weirdness that
Samsung has with their emo LED screens
where they are actually slightly higher
resolution in some color versus other
colors text is extremely crisp this is
the kind of thing I can't convey through
a video like this but no matter how
small the text is on the screen I can
read it clearly even at a distance
because it is so crisp it's really
really nice
those zoe's or whatever they're called
so you open up the camera app and
there's an option that you click on
right here and you go okay I want to
record as owee so let's have a look at
my fps Doug poster here so I go
do-do-do-do-do you can see there's a
little bar going so it's taking some
still pictures as well as a video and
what it does with with those is it
allows you to either see like a
of a 1 to 2 second video capture moment
or a still image and so it's a neat way
of capturing both at full res at the
same time and and and getting a moment
sort of even if you would have missed it
with the and the shutters quick so the
odds of missing it are slimmer but even
if you would have missed it check out
the gallery for a minute though guys so
here's the I want to show you guys the
highlight reel feature okay so here it
sorts things into events so my photos
events so I can go I can pick a day you
can you can move things in and out of
different events and it does so up at
the top so all the individual things are
down here and then up at the top it has
a highlight reel
so it'll automatically set it to music
and it'll add a bunch of cuts it'll add
some kind of effect I'd love to see what
HTC is gonna do with this over time in
terms of adding more music more effects
more cool stuff like that but it's a
really neat way to review the photos and
videos that you took throughout a day in
about 30 seconds so if you're showing
someone with a short attention span
which let's face it we all have short
attention spans these days it's it's
just a really cool effect once that
let's watch the highlight reel for this
day it just does it automatically so
there's the baby using the phone it puts
like a film grain effect on it all of
this is without any work whatsoever here
he is trying to drink some water
I'm just the fact that it's jumping
around to two different different angles
different points in the movie all the
time makes it very impactful so I'd love
to be able to put my own music on it
which is another thing the haptic
feedback on this phone is excellent so
some some phones some devices you touch
it and the whole thing kind of goes burn
and it just feels crappy it feels cheap
not on this one it's very tight very
very responsive the default app loadout
it's not bad I'm not sure if I'm a big
fan of the blinkfeed here so this is
just social media and like sort of other
things like updates but you don't have
to make that your home you can set to
more of a standard Android home and then
this interface here is a vertical
scrolling interface kind of more like
Gingerbread not sure if I'm a big fan of
this either so I think I'm gonna go for
the default Android layout once I've had
more time to personalize it and add the
apps that I want an old speaking of apps
the default app loadout is not bad so I
mean they've got things like SoundHound
on here which is awesome the music app
needs a lot of work the UI is not great
on this one so things like like just
little simple stuff like if you search
for something so-so I don't know let's
find my Ace of Base if you search for
something it doesn't have this option
here to add it to a playlist whereas
when you're just going through your
songs you can see there's here there's a
bunch of options for things you can do
with it so it needs some it needs to be
refined a little bit I just found it not
that easy - oops not that easy to
navigate but here let's go so we've got
your media apps your google apps
it comes with Twitter it comes with car
maps clock productivity wise it comes
with Dropbox almost everything you see
here was pre-loaded on the phone nothing
unnecessary and stupid so I mean okay I
don't know if all of its necessary I
haven't done through it this is all
stuff that I added so far Beats Audio
seems to be just an EQ setting not that
impressed in terms of the overall audio
quality over headphones coming from the
iPhone 4 so let's let's talk general
Android I wouldn't mind if there was an
easier way to see battery life
percentage but I'm sure there's a widget
or an app for that or something moving
from platform that does not have great
app support like Windows Phone 8 is is
just a breath of fresh air being able to
go okay I need I need a scanner app I
need
movie streaming app I need whatever
there's something there for sure you
want to change the fonts on your phone
you might have to read it for that
actually I'm not sure
I recently rooted my wife's droid DNA
and install the custom ROM on and
everything so I'm familiarizing myself
with with the platform as much as I can
and there's a lot of really cool options
when you do that but I won't be rooting
the HTC one during my 30-day period with
it I'm gonna you be using so actually
Sense 5.0 hasn't bothered me yet so this
is this is one thing I mean I'm not a
this isn't something that I think I'll
end up using and blinkfeed is kind of
the kind of thing that I would it's is
sort of like the people app on Windows
Phone 8 where it's like okay here's
another to come some interesting stuff
and I love highlight reels and those are
good the camera on this thing is awesome
so here's just a video of the baby
eating eggs just oh looks so good
okay well that was a very short video no
that was oh that was as Oh or as oe-
twitter app is so superior to the iPhone
one on the iPhone one you'll reach the
top and I'll go loading loading loading
and then you can scroll up again so when
there's a been a lot of them it used to
be you could double click on it in the
iPhone 1 and it would just go to the top
but yeah this one's butter smooth
interfacing with this thing which is
just awesome so overall I'm pretty much
sold on Android at this point but
there'll still be more updates I'm not
just gonna cop out and go yeah day one
Android wins so stay tuned guys don't
