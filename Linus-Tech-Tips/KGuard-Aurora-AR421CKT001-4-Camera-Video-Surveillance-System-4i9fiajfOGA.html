DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so this is a
little new for us and full disclosure
guys we're only doing this review
because these guys Keg are reached out
to us when I happened to be already
shopping for a monitoring system for our
headquarters so I actually don't know if
there are rora series AR for 21 CKD 0:01
is necessarily the best thing for the
price but what I will tell you is that
it's been torture tested beyond just
reviewing it it's been torture tested as
if we're going to actually deploy it
because we are going to actually deploy
it the unit came well packaged with
everything safely tucked in the cameras
were in protective foam and inside the
ample nicely built outer box the
included cables are fairly unexceptional
in terms of the quality but they're nice
and long at 60 feet and they're
completely standard so they have one BNC
connector and then one DC connector that
comes out of each end of the cable so
you could replace them with something
else if you wanted to it should be noted
one of them is thicker than the others
for the higher-end camera and that is to
support the motion tracking feature of
it and it's got a little tracking
control toggle right on the camera I
personally didn't find the motion
tracking that useful since I'm more
interested in constantly monitoring my
employees here but for some people it
would be great because what it basically
does is it takes any motion on the
screen
digitally zooms into it enhances it a
little bit and then it can do all kinds
of cool stuff like start recording so it
can trigger a recording or it can email
you a snapshot
whenever something moves in that zone on
the screen this would be great for
something like your front door the
inclusion of a mouse along with the
remote and the box was a little bit
confusing at first but when I started
navigating the menus it made a lot more
sense the unit definitely operates best
with a mouse so let's get on to general
specs and functionality the DVR outputs
to VGA composite or even HDMI to up to a
1080p display TV or otherwise the
cameras themselves are weather resistant
and record an 800 line
700 line resolution with 30 meters and
20 meters of night-vision depending on
which model so I got one of the
higher-end one and three of the lower
end ones with this particular kit it
includes a 500 gig drive inside that's
one of the first thing I did was like
rip it open and find out what was inside
it's just a standard Seagate Barracuda I
would have liked to see an as grade
drive in there such as a WD purple but
most people will probably never know
this the difference and the good news is
extremely easy to open up and replace
with something else if you want to
alright so let's get into the QuickStart
guide it's actually really solid so all
you do to hook it up physically is plug
in your four BNC connectors plug in the
power to the to the DVR unit here and
then plug in an additional power adapter
to the wall which has four pigtailed
connectors to power the cameras
themselves you position the cameras
wherever you want them plug in an
Ethernet cable plug in HDMI for
monitoring and boot this bad boy up it
drops you into the Quick Start menu
which for straight recording and live
monitoring is pretty much plug-and-play
you can set it so that the Quick Start
menu comes up every time or it doesn't
come up every time you power it on you
can disable it and yeah I think my mom
could actually set up this just just
basic monitoring and recording I did
again I found it quite slow to navigate
with the remote didn't find the remote
that useful I suggest that people keep
on Mouse you know just kind of hooked up
to it and nearby but once you get things
going with the mouse everything in the
menu is fairly intuitive so you right
click to confirm left click to go back
if you've ever used Android with a mouse
and you'll be quite familiar with that
and you know some of the the headers
aren't that well named but the good news
is that the manual is surprisingly good
so I was able to figure out what
everything does and everything largely
works with one exception which was a
little bit disappointing I wasn't able
to get the Dropbox feature working what
that does is when you trigger a
particular event it can take a snapshot
and then automatically upload that still
to Dropbox for you I suspect it has more
to do with my ISP than the unit itself
since they weren't able to replicate my
issue but their support was overall
actually extremely helpful alright so
let's get into live monitoring
DVR controls so that's going to be in
display over here there's a few
different things you can do you can set
up so you can pick all or one on cycle
so actually we're gonna go here out of
the menu out of the menu ok so that's
all down here so you can pick a single
screen you can go ok I want to spy on
Luke or I want to spy on the new guy or
oh my goodness is not a bathroom or you
can cycle through or as you can see all
of them or you can cycle through them
and you can change the cycle speed by
just going into display and then
autosequence changing the dwell you can
also change things like the actual
layout of the screen of them on screen
so because they have models of support
216 cameras that's more of a concern for
those ones because if you have four
cameras you're probably just gonna want
the two by two since there's not a lot
of other options there you can this is
kind of cool you can actually mask off
certain regions so in that bathroom for
example we had masked off you know a bit
of a privacy zone here so you can just
kind of go okay we don't want to see
people's PPS and you know whatever's
going on in that corner we're not that
interested in that you messed that off
and that'll actually be masked off in
the recorded file you can toggle the
camera name as well as the timestamp on
and off so there you go so see that up
there in the top and then you can
trigger alarms now alarms can be used
for all kinds of useful stuff let's just
go into the alarms setting here doop
doop there we go
alarm use for all kinds of useful stuff
including disk error motion and video
loss so yeah guys in the spy movies
where they just like cut all the wires
to the security cameras and nobody
notices cuz they just happened to not be
it this is like a home or small office
class DVR and it supports triggering an
audible alarm when video is lost so
there you go anyway you can also add on
additional sensors but that's not
something that we did motion is
something that I think will be used by
the widest variety of people since its
it's pretty useful so it can be done by
schedule so you can have you can just
have it recording at times or you can
have it actually triggering an alarm if
there's motion at times so I'm gonna go
ahead and there we go so the schedule
here there's normal or there's alarm
and then you can adjust a whole bunch of
the settings inside of it as well so
here we go
sensitivity can be changed to anything
from profoundly not useful because it's
not sensitive enough all the way up to
profoundly not useful because it's too
sensitive and everywhere in between you
can set up so that only a certain area
triggers an alarm so right now I have it
set for the entire screen to trigger an
alarm but if I was to say for example
not care if Luke is benchmarking which
is his actual job and I only want an
alarm to go off when he sits down you
can see that those red ones spin in your
chair like you're having fun at work
he's gonna refuse to do it hey Luke spin
in your chair spin in your chair there
you go so you can see the red dots going
off because he's thinking clearly having
way too much fun thank you very much all
right so you can manage what an alarm
trigger does including setting up a pre
record window before the triggered event
so you get a little bit of pre footage a
post record window pan tilt and zoom
which is supported by the DVR but not by
these cameras unfortunately the alarm
ringer can go off anywhere from 10
seconds to 30 minutes and it's extremely
loud which is why I have it off right
now it's not something that we want to
be having go off while I'm trying to do
a video here and then you can set up
push notifications or email
notifications as well as that Dropbox
feature that I told you about before now
when you consider that a home alarm
system with no video will cost you
however much a month and basically is
doing the same thing as this except now
you get a live view of the action 600
bucks actually sounds like a pretty good
bargain if you don't mind the setup
under information you can head over to
record to see what kind of quality
you're recording in which you've set up
in the sort of the other menu you can
also see how much data you're taking up
per hour then if you go to Disk
Management you can set up how you want
it to overwrite automatically whether by
capacity or by days or just never
although it's not necessarily something
I'd recommend if you plug a USB Drive
into the back you can go ahead and
format that and you can offload footage
to it by using the I yes the record
search here so this is kind of neat in
fact I'm gonna go try and find the clip
to play for you guys that has the the
motion tracking feature on Luke's camera
working there we go so let's go ahead
and playback so you can go ahead and
scrub through the footage see okay there
you go there you go so you were able to
see that Luke's camera is looking for
motion and then zooming in a little bit
on it as well you can scrub through the
footage just like that pick a different
time it's not the fastest most
responsive thing in the world but if you
had an approximate idea of when a theft
in your store took place or whatever
else then you wouldn't have too much
difficulty tracking it down based on the
UI here permissions within these menus
can be controlled by user account by
default there's just one admin account
and I didn't play around with it too
much because I can't think of a reason
why anyone else would really need to use
it one thing that was kind of funny in
the playback and review section is that
they did some QC testing on my unit on
the 6th of January unfortunately it
looks like I have it set to overwrite by
date so it's not there anymore but there
you go they do actually test them before
they go ahead and and ship these babies
out there are some color settings that
you can play around with I didn't really
find them necessarily that useful so you
can adjust brightness contrast hue stuff
like that and then you can do that by
channel or on all of the channels and
the image quality overall you know what
it's not the same as having a bunch of
like HD camcorders set up as a security
system but it's functional you won't be
reading a license plate from across the
street but if you were just trying to
get you know a good look at a you know
shifty character like our new guy here
then you'd probably be able it's better
than a composite sketch based on
someone's you know imagination that they
give to the police for example back to
network setup for a minute other than
the Dropbox feature UPnP dealt with the
port configuration and this was kind of
cool as their mobile app actually worked
effortlessly which was surprising to me
because I've used some of the consumer
grade Wi-Fi cameras and their mobile
apps tend to be really really terrible
all you do is fire up the app Cave uqr
you go ahead and add a new camera by
just scanning
QR code that's on the top of your unit
and then you just go ahead and select
your camera just go ahead blue I
unplugged my Ethernet cable on the back
of this we'll be back in a moment and
we're back anyway the apps available on
iOS and Android is fairly
straightforward you can take screenshots
you can check which channel you want to
monitor if nothing else even if you
don't care about remote monitoring you
cuz you can do it on a PC as well you
don't have to do it on your phone even
if you don't care about it at all it's
pretty useful when you're running around
the house or the office setting up the
cameras because you can actually have a
live view of what you're looking at as
you walk around and try to work on it so
what's the conclusion here I mean it's
hard to say I think you know it's like
you know it's pretty cool you can
monitor your employees you can you know
monitor the back yard I think the one
thing that I guess felt kind of missing
like because I'm not a super heavy user
like I just wanted some basic video
monitoring so the one thing that I kind
of felt was missing is I'm a bit of a
pack rat so I wouldn't have minded some
kind of a networked Nazz Naza automatic
backup of the footage so I could archive
more of it but I guess I could just put
a bigger hard drive in the one concern
there is if I would like if I was a
thief breaking into a house and I
realized there was a camera system I'd
probably try and find the box that goes
with it but then you could always be
smart about that and hide it somewhere
or make it somewhere difficult to access
and then also just have a home alarm
system so they don't have a whole lot of
time to look for it until the cops come
and that's what maybe that maybe that's
all a non-issue I mean like I said I
haven't tested many other products in
the category so I can't really compare
to anything else I'd love to hear your
guys's comments if there's something
else that I should be checking out it's
definitely like much more feature
complete and much better to use than a
lot of the consumer grade like nanny cam
on steroids style home monitoring Wi-Fi
cameras way way better than that and not
even that inordinately more expensive
but let me know if there's anything else
that you feel like we should really be
checking out in this category I think
that's pretty much it guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment in the video
and let us know if you have any other
thoughts about it
request or other like you know security
system stuff or if you thought this was
totally stupid and we should never talk
about this category again that's fine
too and we do have a support link in the
video description as well so you can
