I freaking swear these guys that kaleo's
have to be some of the biggest teases in
the industry because this is the third
time now that I'm looking at a
completely new iteration of their
product and none of these things have
actually reached the mass market yet
they're just like we're just gonna keep
making cooler and cooler prototypes and
not stress out too much about anybody
actually ever being able to buy one so
this one right here is the NSG s0 this
is the latest prototype of what will
hopefully sometime late this year early
next oh yes oh yes sure yeah whatever I
don't even believe you guys but this is
the latest iteration of their fully
passive PC case now the last time I
checked one of these out which was on
our Holi series you can check that out
here it was actually their technology
was modded into a lien leo series case
this time they've gone you know what
that was way too complicated for an end
user to try to configure by themselves
so screw it we're just gonna go make a
case and this is what we've got here so
there are two massive radiators one in
the front that handles all the cooling
for the GPU completely passively we're
talking gtx 980ti
at 61 degrees Celsius and then at the
bottom has your front i/o as well as a
couple of mounts for either two and a
half or three and a half inch drives oh
and if you want to kick it into high
gear I guess you can throw in a couple
of 120 millimeter fans and then this
additional one and all man I just hope
fillet I didn't break it too bad there
yeah pop that back into place and then
this one on the back handles the cooling
for the CPU and can also accept fans if
you want to take it to the extreme now
these guys are martyrs at their course
and I love the industrial design in this
case because the whole thing is
basically pure functionality pure you
chillah t gigantic I mean we're talking
about is it 21 kilos of aluminum or
something stupid like that like pure
aluminum cooling raw power and then
blank canvases so you can etch whatever
you want on here you could wrap it in
vinyl you could paint it you could do
pretty much whatever you want with it
and they've made a lot of improvements
to the overall design since some of the
early iterations so now instead of i/o
having to be kind of machined into the
back of the case and then you run the
cables internally now they've gone with
an open design type case that uses
tempered glass to cover it up and gives
you full access to the i/o so you're
probably wondering why are they in the
see sonic booth if you equip it with AC
Sonic passive power supply if you use
their GPU plates along with their like
foam aluminum cooling things and oh by
the way these covers are gonna be
available in a variety of designs you
can run your extremely high performance
system this is a 69 50 X and a 1080 T I
completely fanless Lee all you will hear
in a very quiet room is a little bit of
boiling because that's how the thing is
cooled there's no pump even the coolant
moves pretty much on its own through
natural convection so all that sounds
great - how much is it gonna cost
actually not quite as bad as you might
think they're targeting around 600 euros
which does sound like a lot but when you
consider what an all-aluminum and
tempered glass case design would cost
you Plus then it comes with water
cooling grade cooling for the GPU and
the CPU that's actually not that bad so
thanks for checking out this video once
again all of our coverage of Computex
2017 is brought to you by the Corsair
one their 12 litre freaking amazing VR
ready gaming PC that comes with a quad
core Core i7 processor and up to a GTX
1080 Ti as well as synergy the software
that lets you share your keyboard and
mouse between multiple computers even a
Windows machine a Linux machine and
