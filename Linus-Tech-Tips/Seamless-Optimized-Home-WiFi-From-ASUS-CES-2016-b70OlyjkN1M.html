networking ecosystem that works with an
app that will enable you to optimize
your signal strength and performance
stay tuned to find out how thanks to
Squarespace for sending us here to CES
2016 if you want to check them out their
link is in the description down below
the app was developed in partnership
with cloud check which enables you to
kind of walk around your house with a
phone or tablet checking signal strength
along the way
it sends numbers and data back to a soos
where they crunch that information and
input real-time data back to you which
is actually super handy you can make
decisions off of that or whether you
need to just move things around your
house or add a repeater here or there or
whatever this can help people like
Dennis who has crazy signal problems all
throughout his house and it's weird and
confusing and this would probably solve
this problem outside of that there's the
Asus router app which has real-time
traffic visualization packet
prioritization Diagnostics easy firmware
upgrades and their what the fast suite
of software stuff which helps you
identify problems and prioritize things
along the way one of the cool things
about the Diagnostics part of that is
that it's flexible Diagnostics so you
can decide what you want to troubleshoot
and win so if you want to see if it's on
the ISPs side of things you can diagnose
just your modem that's something that I
would definitely take advantage of
speaking of modems the next product is
the Asus CM 32 which includes a modem in
its router package which is actually
relatively interesting speaking of being
able to diagnose one thing at a time
it has mu-mimo which is multi-user mimo
which is quite cool a 4 by 4 array it's
wireless AC with a peak speed of over
2.5 gigabits which is why it is also
called an AC 2600 it's certified for a
5,000 square-foot house but it does have
an MSRP of 299 that 5000 square feet
isn't enough there's the RP AC 68 U
which is a Wi-Fi repeater or more
accurately in my opinion a media bridge
it has five Gigabit Ethernet ports a USB
3.0 port which has lower overhead so
it's able to act faster which is cool
because you can plug in like an external
hard drive or a USB Drive or whatever
and it will act as an ass next up we
have the RP ac 66 repeaters and you
might be wondering why I keep on talking
about repeaters it might not seem like
the most exciting thing ever but they
feature seamless transfer which is kind
of the most exciting thing ever what
that enables you to do
is you know how when you're at someone's
house and they have Wi-Fi repeaters and
you have to switch which one you're on
and manually and it's really annoying
because sometimes you might be on one
bar of connection to one of them but
it's not switching you to the other one
because you have to do it it's
frustrating and annoying it pisses you
off but then you go to a school or like
an airport or hotel and it transfers
seamlessly and it's all nice and stuff
now you're able to do that at your house
that's actually really sick and if that
ease-of-use wasn't enough for you they
also have their wall plug built into the
unit so you can very easily just plug it
in or even just plug a power extension
to that if you decide that isn't exactly
what you wanted to do but I don't know
it's pretty simple to me anyways thank
you for checking out our soos networking
content at CES thank you to Squarespace
for sending us here this year check out
Squarespace if you want to make a
website for I don't know maybe a company
that sets up networking for people you
can set up seamless connections and seem
like a badass by just using a su stuff I
don't know it works it's cool you can
use their template edging engine to
create a website that looks super slick
and you can even use a cover page thing
if now you need a job because Isis just
took yours from you because their
networking is too easy I don't know
whatever works for you that's fine
