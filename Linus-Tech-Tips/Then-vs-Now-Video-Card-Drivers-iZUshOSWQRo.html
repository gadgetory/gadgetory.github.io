graphics card release that doesn't quite
perform up to the expectations of the
fans of graphics card maker a or
graphics card maker B the immediate
response is will the drivers haven't
matured yet so um yeah it's gonna be
like way better later we decided to
quantify using our trusty GTX 480 just
how well NVIDIA supports its products
and therefore its customers in the long
term actually we've got another really
cool graphic centric video coming soon
so slam that like button if you want to
know how the gtx 980m stacks up against
the GTX 980 in a truly apples-to-apples
comparison with both running the same
desktop 4790k processor wowza
so let's start by saying that there are
a number of ways that graphics card
manufacturers can support end-of-life
products they can add new features
here's a great example where Nvidia
brought DSR support to Fermi based
graphics cards like our four eighty over
four years after the products release
they can address compatibility issues
whether it's a rendering bug in a new
game or a new operating system that
requires a specific driver for your
older hardware to work or and this is
the one we'll be focused on today since
it's the easiest to empirically measure
they can improve performance of the
product over time as their driver team
gets better acquainted with the
microarchitecture being used similar to
how developers will unlock more of a
game consoles potential over time so let
me introduce you to our methodology we
used our standard test bench a core i7
59 30 K with 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory on
the Zeus x99 deluxe motherboard because
while that hardware didn't exist at all
at the time that people were buying GTX
480 s we wanted to eliminate potential
bottlenecks and avoid changing any
variables other than the one being
tested which is the graphics card driver
we ran through a limited but hopefully
fairly representative test suite of
games at 1080p to triple-a titles that
were current when the GTX 480 came out
just cause 2 and metro 2033 to see if
there's any improvement in those and
then two more modern triple-a titles far
cry 4 and Witcher 3 to see if the owners
who sometimes go to great lengths to
obtain their graphics cards right on
launch day can expect better performance
not only in the games that are being
actively optimised but also in future
hypothetical games that will definitely
be awesome and not disappointing ever
which brings us to the last key piece of
the puzzle the drivers we picked out
five drivers ranging from a month after
the release of the GTX 480 so April 2010
- the most current driver as of August
20th 2015 with a span of approximately
16 months in between each of them so
then how did Nvidia do well in our
first game metro 2033 there doesn't
appear to be a strong argument for
waiting for driver improvements to get
better performance out of your graphics
card I mean yes that's a 10% improvement
which isn't insignificant when you
consider that we base our initial
purchase decisions off of less at times
but for a demanding game like this it
isn't going to be the difference between
it limping along and running butter
smooth at 60fps in our second game just
cause to owners of GTX 480 s got a 16%
performance improvement just from
waiting 16 months with an additional 10%
for waiting another 16 months for a
total of over 25 percent from there
whether it's because the software team
had just extracted as much as they could
from the hardware or whether they were
simply focused on newer things the
improvements taper off but not shabby in
Far Cry 4 our first modern title we
gained some insight into the
optimization process for older cards
with the 2014 driver outperforming the
2010 driver by an excellent 20% but
interesting note here while a game ready
driver was released for far cry 4 later
on that year at least for this older
card it doesn't appear to have been
focused on performance when we jumped
forward to our 2015 driver and see that
it performs exactly the same finally we
get to witcher 3 more evidence for what
looks like it's ultimately the
conclusion here the improvements being
made to your older graphics card seem to
come pretty fast and hard in the first
three years after release a massive 30
percent for Witcher 3 by the way with
support beyond that being more focused
on bug fixes and compatibility
enhancements which doesn't mean they
aren't there I mean seeing the same
piece of hardware change so much we're
talking measurably and often noticeably
to the naked eye better gaming
experiences over its usable lifespan is
pretty darn impressive which I guess
leads us pretty well into the
inspiration for today's how have they
supported us over the years episode
a video that TD Bank made about how they
surprised some of their customers with a
beautiful look back at the important
milestones and changes that they've gone
through since first opening their
accounts at TD Bank they're actually
finding this out for the first time when
they're watching this video but my
parents actually co-signed and helped me
open my first bank account when I was 11
at Canada Trust which merged with TD
Bank back in 2000 and while that video
is definitely a touch sentimental it
really made me reflect back on
everything that I've gone through in
that time so give it a watch by clicking
