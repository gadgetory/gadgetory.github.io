little while to get to the fractal
design art MIDI was actually out a very
very long time ago the first time they
showed this was actually CES 2011 but
better late than never
as I always say I don't always say that
but in this case it makes sense better
late than never
I'm gonna be having a look at the
fractal design arc maybe mid tower case
so Frank the designs cases are all about
simplistic looks the first one that hit
the market was redefining r3 so the
default was kind of an ultimate compact
silent case it took a lot of them it
took a lot of cues there's no denying it
from the enttec p18 x-series
however what it did also do was add a
few things of its own
such as the mod units which were a way
to choose whether you want an optimal
airflow or silence it also added us a
sort of a different way of doing the
noise dampening that was lower cost and
that's resulted in the less expensive
case at the end of the day they
dramatically altered the interior layout
which is what's entirely their own
design and one thing that fractal is
really good at with all their cases is a
good balance on the interior design so
fractal ops for using the space in a way
that is beneficial to the user rather
than sort of going with the status quo
they were one of the first ones to take
a case and instead of filling the front
of it with five and a quarter inch base
and then doing some three and a half
inches in the bottom they just do a
couple five and a quarter inch base and
fill the rest of the case with three and
a half inches because most users are
putting in not six DVD drives but more
like eight hard drives that is that is a
more likely scenario so let's have a
look at the outside of the Ark this is
more like I guess a second-generation
fractal case it has a better internal
layout than the define our three and
here we go
so we've got see this this is cool so
we've got a honeycomb mesh on the
for the case with a noise dampening as
well as dust filtering foam on the
inside of it so what that means is that
even though this is an ultimate airflow
more of a gamer style case than a define
our three you can see that same foam
here
tons of airflow you're still not
necessarily going to totally give up on
the noise the noise compromise that
usually comes with a more like a gaming
case the front uses that brushed plastic
that I'm actually a huge fan of because
it looks really good you guys can you
see it in the in the camera it looks
great the fingerprints don't mark it's
much easier to clean and I add the cost
less it's like win-win-win in the front
you see a single whoops oh I'm gonna
have to I'm gonna have to check what
sort of a fan that is it looks like a
140 but I could be wrong it could be a
120 look at that no it isn't 140 okay so
there's a single 140 there and probably
mounting for another one we're gonna get
it open I'm not that familiar with this
case front panel IO so we've got huh
looks like there's a little bent piece
of metal there but we can probably fix
that with a needle so front USB three
two front USB two power switch
headphones microphone as well as a reset
switch the sides are pretty
straightforward so you got your standard
black side panel over there you got your
standard rear so you can either mount a
120 or 140 it comes with a 140 there's
your i/o there's a couple of water
cooling tubing grommets most people
don't use those but they're there we've
got seven plus one PCI slots if you have
like a fan controller or something you
can put it there
obviously you can't actually install an
expansion card there but seven standard
slots bottom power supply which can
either be mounted one way or the other
way you can see all the holes are
present and then you can either use the
filtered bottom that's a removable
filter and mount it that way so it draws
air from the bottom you can see we've
got nice tall rubber feet here so you're
not going to be restricted in terms of
airflow this is smart to look at this
it's a nice touch it's really really
wide at the front it's easy
when you're putting it in or you can
flip it around the other way
should you prefer that on the side we've
got what looks like a 140 or a 100 and
something something bigger than that
hold on a second
yeah that's 140 or 180 millimeter on the
side so it doesn't come with a fan there
but you can install one should you see
fit so here is my screwdriver and let's
get it opened up big fan of fractal
cases I might as well just say that up
front here guys I love the define r3 and
pretty much everything they've released
since then has lived up to my
expectation that was set back then with
the define r3 here we are on the inside
so if you if you have a define r3 or if
you know the define r3 this will look
pretty similar but they upgraded some
significant things so these front fans
are 120 or 140 s now which is awesome
because the define r3 is only 120 s this
hard drive cage can actually be rotated
if you prefer to mount the cables in a
different whoops sorry about that guys
this is not a magnetic screwdriver which
is what I'm used to using there we are
so it can be rotated this way or
actually removed completely if you have
a long graphics card or if you want to
mount like some kind of weird accessory
here and then this these plastic pieces
can actually also be removed which is
very very cool not only that but it also
gives completely unrestricted airflow
access to the video cards from this
front 140 millimeter fan so you are
taking sort of your ultimen airflow case
removing obstructions if you're only
gonna have four drives and what kind of
drives you use doesn't really matter
because the the included hard drive
sleds are a little bit stuck right now
hold on that's funny oh look at that
they're screwed in on this one so on the
define are three there aren't screws
here to hold them in but on this one
there are so you can either use those
and that will give you more safety and
chipping or you can not use those and
they do clip into place and they won't
come out until you do this so
compatible with either two and a half
inch using these holes oh this is cool
look at that the holes are centered
instead of being off to the side so they
don't interfere with the rubber grommets
I've seen this overlooked time and time
again whether it's grommets or whether
it's those those little pokey pieces
from the side you know the ones where
you bend them open to put the drive in a
lot of the time the SSD mount is over
here and it interferes with it you can't
even put it in without removing the hard
drive mounting piece so that's very very
smart so there you go so they're
compatible with whatever you want so if
you have like two SSDs in raid and then
a couple hard drives in raid you can
take this whole thing out and get better
airflow and more space inside what is
already a fairly compact and efficiently
laid out case I'm just gonna remove this
bottom one so that you can get out the
accessories there I'm gonna have to find
that through I dropped at some point as
well so let's shake things up a little
bit and I'm gonna have a look at the
accessories before we continue looking
at the inside of the case and they're
all pretty much laid out here but I've
actually never used this case before I
only knew it from sort of looking at it
and going yeah that looks nice those
look like cool features but I've never
seen one in person yet all the screws
are here
so you go out all your fan mounting
screws all your thumb screws your little
speaker they include a speaker which
isn't part of the case but hey if you
want one then you have one they include
a five and a quarter to three and a half
inch adapter also the nice brushed
plastic a couple of reusable cable ties
okay
fan controller that can be mounted here
that is connects to up to well you got
three fans cool hey can be powered
either by molex or by a fan connector
and there you go that's pretty much it
have the included accessories so let's
finish up with the inside here we've got
our five and a quarter inch base one of
which actually includes a three and a
half inch adapter inside it I don't know
if you're gonna be able to get a good
angle but you can take that out by
removing these thumb screws it's also
got SSD mounting on it or hard drive
mounting so that's some pretty cool
thing there
so basically your options are as follows
you can do dual five and a quarter three
and a half external three and a half
internal five and a quarter three and a
half external or three and a half
internal times with a bobcat on what I
said but you've got all kinds of options
with the included adapters and lift
included pieces oh wait no you can't do
that okay okay okay okay so this goes on
the front with the adapter that's bolted
in here already to make it a three and a
half external there we go no I got it we
have a CPU cut oh not the biggest one
I've seen in the past but I think
they've made a reasonable compromise
here by putting cable management loops
here instead of expanding this because
you should still be able to reach from
the back if you need to they've also
reinforced the motherboard tray just by
putting in these bends that does make it
stronger cable management is a fairly
strong point with the define r3 and it
looks like a fairly strong point with
the arc as well we've got nice flexible
rubber tons of space in the back that
looks like plenty of space for a 24 inch
connect our 24-pin connector nice
flexible rubber here here here and here
these are a little bit less flexible
than the bigger ones but they should
still look okay even after you run
something through them dual 120
millimeter fans supported in the top or
dual 140 s you see you've got a lot of
different fan mounting options here
which is really cool so we have full
support for a dual 120 mil rads which is
a huge one for me that is very very
important for me and in a chassis this
small there aren't too many competitors
where you're going to have room to do
that so very very cool now let's have a
look at it from the other side so I
might use my screwdriver again from the
factory these are pretty tight although
you don't have to put them back in that
tight yourself so it'll be easier to
remove without using a screwdriver later
there we are like I said lots of room
for cable management here in the back
there's the screws and I'll also show
you guys the front panel connectors so
we've got an internal header USB 3 USB 2
I'm gonna be another USB 2 somewhere in
all likelihood Poe no there isn't
sorry USB 2 front panel audio power
switch power LED hand got to be a recent
hard drive LED and reset switch right
there only the USB three one is blue
everything else is black which is nice
to see and I think that pretty much
covers it so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the arc MIDI and the
reason that I'm unboxing this now is
actually so that I can use this case for
an upgrade to my wife's PC so she's
gonna be going from socket 1156 to
socket 1155 and getting a 2600 K going
on in there so should be good I'm
looking forward to using this case I'm
actually replacing the 800 D because
it's there's not as much space in our
computer room anymore now that I have my
tech table in here so we wanted to get
things a little bit smaller so we're
gonna be going with the arc MIDI very
exciting don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other computer videos sorry guys I'm
already outfitting it with its sexy
matching PC power and cooling power
supply for awesome black and white
internals but something I forgot to
mention is how to get at the front fan
so you just do the clips here 1 2 3 and
then pop off the front so the fans are
installed just by clipping them into
place and then running the cables into
the rest of the case very very very very
straightforward and easily compatible
with a number of different kinds of fans
so that you can see one that's empty
very very easy to clean as well because
it comes off even with one end and the
other hand trying to hold a camera
steady</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
