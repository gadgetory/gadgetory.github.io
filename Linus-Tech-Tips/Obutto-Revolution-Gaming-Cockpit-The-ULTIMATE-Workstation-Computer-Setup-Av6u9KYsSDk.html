about sits here on the table in front of
me but the item we'll be reviewing today
simply doesn't fit here and no that
wasn't a cheap shot at your mama but
rather a factual observation about the
Oh bottle revolution a gaming cockpit
that I combined with three LG 31 Nu 97
4k monitors the standalone video about
which is coming soon by the way to make
the ultimate workstation computer setup
that is taking up about half of my
living room at home where I have to film
it at the moment so is it worth it
compared to a traditional desk and chair
full let's find out shall we
experience silent performance with the
new Pooler Master Silencio 652 s
minimalist design maximum compatibility
click now to learn more it all begins
with the package the revolution comes in
two boxes one for the racing style seat
and another large extremely heavy 49
kilograms to be exact box for the
remainder of this diabolical contraption
so it's well over a hundred pounds and
native thick steel tubing and steel
plate now this baby may cost a thousand
dollars once you equip it with a couple
of optional accessories but there is no
question in my mind about whether the
ruggedness of the construction matches
the price tag the setup process is how
do I describe this kindly you know how
model kits have skill levels on the side
of the package well Ikea would be the
easy level and this would be the
insanity level all the parts are neatly
labeled and packaged mind you a couple
that were labeled incorrectly thankfully
though I know the difference between a
lock washer and nut and everything in
the box was amazingly well protected and
arrived looking absolutely perfect you
can tell they really care about these
things getting to the customer in one
piece but the included written
instructions are frankly awful with
illustrations that are too dark to see
and many steps either missing or
contradicting the video instructions
which thankfully by contrast are
excellent if a little needlessly
difficult to find on the Oberto website
overall the process took about three to
four hours with the help of my wife and
the help of my two-year-old so you could
probably do it yourself in about three
to four hours but another pair of hands
is definitely nice to have around for
certain steps like mounting the monitor
on the vase amount but once it's over do
you feel rewarded for your effort well
let's take a quick tour of the unit
shall we
we'll start with the main frame which
consists of two bottom runners a main
shaft that ends in a rubber grip II
covered plate that can be oriented
facing up or if you're willing to get a
little creative kind of towards you and
is pre-drilled for Vesak compliant
monitors and some popular racing wheels
and two phenomenally robust side pieces
that form a little cage around your feet
now from the look at this whole assembly
you think that it supports the user the
and a fully stocked beverage cooler but
it's actually just a way over belt
starting point that everything else
attaches to the footrest with the
thoughtfully pre-drilled holes for
pedals attaches with four bolts through
the sides and can be positioned forwards
or backwards with a variety of different
bolt holes and can then be angled
according to your preference with
another two bolts optionally there's
also a kit to bolt to fully articulating
arms that terminate until table Vasa
plates for cockpit instruments or other
accessories and that come with acrylic
keyboard and mouse wrists that go on
them by default now I've read a number
of user reviews for this product that it
seems like the general consensus is that
this combo is a must-have but I suspect
the folks writing these reviews sit a
little higher in their seats than my
petite 5 foot 6 inch frame allows me to
because thanks to their lack of height
adjustment I didn't find them very
comfortable to use and spent most of my
time with the stock keyboard and mouse
plate which thankfully is height
adjustable with a simple turning wheel
and plate is probably the right word for
that thing it's solid steel with
reinforcement bars underneath and
attaches via an articulating arm on the
left side of the rails that support the
seat and then bolt into the main frame
it's covered in a cloth type mousepad
material at my am 45 mouse tracks
perfectly on and I found quite pleasing
to the touch
and it can be easily positioned exactly
where it's most comfortable I did have
some complaints about it though I was
able to solve the issue where the joint
swung too freely making it kind of hard
to keep my peripherals in one place by
simply tightening the joints with one of
the included allen keys but the sag of
this thing wasn't as easy for me to
address now oh but it is aware of the
issue with like a huge gigantic metal
thing hanging out from you know one one
mounting point and they actually include
these little screws that you can use to
compensate for some say the issue is
that my angle mount that sticks on the
left side of the chair wasn't quite
manufactured within acceptable
tolerances so while the platform is
level when swung out away from the seat
it's very saggy when it's in the proper
position the good news is that DIY and a
solution to this would likely be as
simple
jamming a washer or two into where the
arm mounts to the base are bending it
myself
and that would only have to last until
Oh buddies at least if online feedback
is to be believed excellent support
sends a new unit of that piece on the
subject of support let's move on to the
monitor mount which unintuitive lis
although I can see they did it this way
so that movement in the chair doesn't
shake the monitors is actually a
completely separate freestanding
component of the entire setup the two
side arms attached to base runners with
bolts then are held together by two
sliding tubes that go inside that and
then another one that sits over top of
it that has a reinforced piece with an
articulating arm and a vase a plate on
the end that gives you distance control
depending on your screen size and
resolution tilt swivel pivot and a
little bit of height adjust which is
handled with this screw right here but
while it has all the features that I'd
want to see on a checklist and the
optional triple monitor mount with its
two additional base plates on
articulating arms mounts to the existing
set up very easily the implementation of
the monitor position adjustments is
probably the weakest part of the entire
cockpit a variety of lengths of the
necessary bolts are included but I had
to fabricate my own spacers to keep them
from damaging the backs of my monitors
and I needed to alan keyes a wrench a
level and an assistant to get the
monitors all reasonably well aligned
height needs to be basically guessed at
since you have to support the arm to
mount it and then it'll say once you let
go and tilt adjustments are a problem
for the same reason and because the only
lock for tilt is to wrench the crap out
of one screw and then hope that the
friction keeps it in place
the problems aside I do have to admire
the versatility of a buddy system and I
don't know how they could have done it
better while keeping the whole thing
affordable you can get a wider range of
height control if you lift up the entire
thing and screw it on with a different
set of bolt holes depending on your
height and the monitors that you're
using I'm using the middle one which I
found was ideal for my triple 31 inch
displays or a single larger one it would
probably be good for that as well but it
will work with basically any display
with a 50 100 or 200 millimeter vase of
bolt pattern if I had three smaller
displays though I
likely use the lowest one since I'm
pretty short but that's the flexibility
that it gives you let's move on to the
seat and general economics the seat gets
both positive and negative feedback from
me it's pretty comfortable though maybe
not as wide as some of the folks at the
upper range of about who's supported
weight might prefer and the construction
is pretty good with mesh in the areas
that heat up and this pretty cool
carbon fiber II pleather elsewhere the
seat is mounted too to kind of frame
pieces which sit on the floor with
scratch protectors at one end and then
are bolted into the main frame at the
other end although scratch protectors
aside I would definitely recommend
putting this whole thing on some carpet
scraps if you really care about your
floor and then the chair is bolted to
that using one of two sets of holes the
normal ones and then the short people
ones like a standard car seat it can be
reclined and slid forward and backward
from there giving the revolution nearly
limitless
ergonomic options but I have a couple of
issues regardless the first one which is
easily resolved is to do with how
time-consuming these adjustments are
between all the different bolts and
wrenches and the way that adjusting one
thing can create a chain reaction of
other adjustments like if I move my cup
holder and you know shift turnout
forward then I might need to move my
monitors and my chair and my footrest
it's a bit of a pain but like I said
it's easily resolved just by spending
some time on it the second issue is a
bit trickier but I think ties in really
nicely to my conclusion for the Oh
bottle revolution as a workstation the
chair lacks the one adjustment that I
really needed height I like everything
else where it is but I'd like to sit a
couple of inches higher and that's the
real strength of this product even if
it's not perfect out of the box it is a
fantastic foundation if you want to you
know run out and grab a car seat at an
auto junkyard that's you know more to
your liking and fabricate a cheap
mounting adapter or rise or add pretty
much whatever else you want to it I mean
there are some minor complaints that I
haven't covered already cable management
could have been given some more thought
with random velcro straps being the only
real solution I came up with getting in
and out of it is a bit of a bear even
when my bloody cat isn't sitting on it I
mean this thing is like a feline magnet
and the wife approval ranking for this
product is fairly low unless you have
somewhere that you can put it where
she'll never have to see it but all of
that aside for $800 especially when you
compare that to a standalone desk and
chair it's an astonishingly well-built
product especially if you can get some
use out of it for gaming as well as work
which I'll be getting into more and my
follow up video once Asus chips me a few
rog swift monitors to hook up to it
speaking of hooking up our buddies on
rich hero asked us to introduce their
new cheer Oh tough 9,000 milliamp hour
battery bank a great addition to a
travel bag for campers hikers skier
snowboarders or really anyone else but
loves to spend time in the great
outdoors the great outdoors like I've
played on that server before either way
the Tuck is dust proof water-resistant
and shock resistant and even has a tiny
animal IDI flashlight and they also have
a new addition to their cable lineup a
two-in-one version of their danboard
micro USB cable that we showed off last
time that includes an adapter for the
Apple lightning connector that way even
if you're an Apple or Android zealot
your poser friends can still bomb a
charge off you assuming you want those
scrubs touching your stuff so guys be
sure to check out both of those cool
products from cheer-off the link in the
video description thanks to cheero for
