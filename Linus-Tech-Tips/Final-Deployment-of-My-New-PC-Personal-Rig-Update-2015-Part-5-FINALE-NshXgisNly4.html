big update 2015 yes I know it is 2016
now that's not the point the point is
that it started in 2015 today is all
about the final deployment in the
cabinet in the closet so let's make it
happen
a Pacers as7 20 is a dual interface USB
3.1 type-c equipped SSD with read speeds
of up to 540 megabytes per second check
out the link in the video description to
learn more yeah let's just like tip it
okay well I didn't really do anything
now I've got to load up all the other
junk into the back of the truck here so
this is actually our first look at my
wife's machine so it also had the front
bezel of the same case airbrushed by our
neighbor here neighbor Steve let's get
this baby loaded up too okay looking
good even optical drive LightScribe okay
so here's a situation there's actually a
lot to do first I've got to get this
ruthless bastard up the stairs I have
straight up no idea how that's happening
these pcs this ups these rails these
monitors all need to go up the stairs as
well this Nass needs the correct
hardware put inside it and finally all
of the gear that we are no longer using
in here needs to GTFO so let's get down
to it shall we
okay well this thing weighs a metric
shed load but there are some ways that I
can significantly reduce its weight then
by removing as many of the outer panels
and inner components as I can before
trying to get up the stairs
you move thank you I need more leverage
kappa oh okay retraction or something I
need more something so what I hate about
camera people you never lend a hand they
just sit there and watch I think what I
need right now is some Nick V's lifting
tips all right Nicky be here back with
another moving tip okay so we got this
big-ass thing here what we want to do is
lift with a back twist jerk in a you
know jerking motion
he knows the most ergonomic way to do
this go to sleep supposed to be nothing
I'm actually gonna have to go into his
room in order to tilt this up okay sorry
honey go back to bed
oh wow that's a really taste it okay it
looks like this is going to fit that's
good man this stuff is heavy okay so
this end the other one in the room and
there already are the clay power ah
thousand volt damn ups is that I'm going
to be using for the two systems in there
my system gets its own cuz it's a little
bit more powerful and then my wife's is
going to share her ups with the the
server slash Nazz life personal rig oh
wow this one's a lot of here okay protip
I don't don't carry Black Mountain cases
by the mounting rail and a sir said let
there be monitor upgrades and there were
and it was good and finally of course
none of this is staying here it's all
gonna be rack mounted so here are my
rails so I've been meaning to pull out
some of the consumer grade gear that
I've had in this server for quite some
time this ws board is great board
doesn't support ECC memory this raid
card great raid card doesn't properly
support monitoring the disks and now
I've replaced all that stuff with a more
suitable configuration so while I don't
have the ball in six or eight terabyte
hard drives that I do at the office I do
have one terabyte WD blacks and I am
using an enterprise-grade SSD cache in
RAID one to allow me to get the best
possible performance out of thee yes the
you thought they were retired but
they're not Emulex ten gigabit network
card so I'm actually going to be using
those combined with the onboard mix in
order to enable not ten gigabit but at
least faster than one gigabit transfers
between all the rack mounted computers
just using single cables from them to
each other and actually not having them
go through the router of a switch at all
I changed up the motherboard to one that
has remote management so I've added a
little ikv M module right there I've
changed out to ECC memory not really
necessary with on raid but I want the
utmost instability I'm going to be
running VMs on here so that I can have
stuff like my air video server running
on Windows and I can have stuff like
crash plan running in a docker container
there's a lot of functionality here I
may do a follow-up video on just this
machine and then I'm running a xeon
processor so that i can take advantage
of that ECC Ram and then it uses a very
similar case to clover server actually
it's just the twelve Bay versus the
eight day one because at home I don't
have those same high-capacity drives so
if I want any storage at all I need to
have a few more expansion bays there
okay so now I got to clear out this
corner and I really hope you guys either
don't look too closely at or don't judge
me for my power setup in here I am going
to be working on something
little bit better than a PowerBar run
through the wall the future okay so most
of the network cables running into the
next room over there actually need to go
away because all of the networking is
pretty much going to stay in here now
yep that's my that's my wall hole oh no
I pulled out the nails this is the
world's most get a wall down so step one
is going to be our UPS battery backups
we're going to put these on the bottom
because they're really heavy they're
pain in the butt to to move you don't
want your finger ending up being all
top-heavy and the other main reason is
that I don't have shelves for them so I
need to sit them on the bottom of the
unit so that the entire weight isn't
being borne by these puppies really yeah
okay one down second ups here we go
so now all that's left to do is plug
those in to the wall and then all my
other devices can plug into lows for
power so I don't actually have to get
back here anymore
okay so for those of you who haven't
played around with background stuff
before basically you take this inner
slide you pop the little latch here all
this without slicing your fingers open
and then these rails mount to the side
of your case with the screws that are
included with the rails then you take
the other sides of the rails and you
mount these inside your cabinet
hopefully in the right position which is
not always easy wow this is a really
shallow cabinet I didn't really
is these weren't the same dip as the
ones at the office that's okay that is a
very minor curveball no I'm one spot hi
of course I am yeah it needs to go down
just a touch
so beard wanted to work up a sweat today
thinking to go to the gym today I could
mount some server crap let's just stay
in place please ah
all right fitness fine as long as it's a
fit that's weird what are we hitting if
we just give it the old ah there you go
three units rack-mounted easy okay it's
okay it gets easier these rails are so
much friggin better they lock on like
that no nonsense goes good
see this one now now these ones are a
little bit more finicky to align here I
can live with that
for the benefits that they give
there we go look at that man I love
these rails it comes free of the entire
thing so you can just go fook I'm
working on the wife PC slide that baby
back in there there it is
okay last one then I like those rails
better Oh fortunately these are really
fast to turn hotel it's in so let's get
it all wired up then I'm probably gonna
get ear mounts for the ubiquity router
as well as the neck hair switch at some
point I'm gonna give myself another
power bar as well up here I have a more
elegant solution at the office but this
actually isn't too bad
I'm just gonna hook those up on top here
UPS's are on let's get networking hooked
up okay this is going well now
Ethernet for waifu pc i mean okay
overall not perfect cable management
still need some work yeah this is as
good as it's gonna be for now okay so
with everything hooked up it is finally
time for the secret sauce the magic
bullet if you will and those of you who
have been following from the beginning
will already know this but i've had a
lot of people asking me who have tuned
into personal rig update 2015 later how
are you planning to get all of your i/o
into the next room one optical
Thunderbolt cable per system from
Corning that's why I added those as soos
funderbolt cards to the systems so all
I've got to do is run these puppies
through the wall and in theory we're
pretty much off to the races how much is
left okay okay now obviously a single
Thunderbolt cable no matter how magical
is going to need something on the other
end to make it work so that is where
these come in these are Thunderbolt hubs
from El Gato
they've got 3 USB 3 ports they've got
mic and headphone jacks
they've got Thunderbolt pass-through if
you want to daisy chain more stuff and
if you wanted they've got an HDMI out as
well as Ethernet we're going to use
Thunderbolt 2 DisplayPort to go straight
to our monitor and that is all the i/o
for the computer again cable management
not done but it is somewhat moment of
truth time oh that's nice
there it is theoretically perfect
silence with no performance compromise
whoa it worked right away what were the
friggin odds of that nothing ever works
on the first try for me all we've got to
do in theory is get some Thunderbolt
drivers installed on the system which I
have to do from over here ah yes always
connect Elgato Thunderbolt dock okay hey
look at that
keyboards working it worked once now we
just have to do it again all that's left
is to run one more Thunderbolt cable and
we are pretty much off to the races
ah someone was asking for my tweet the
other night
what desk this was and the answer is it
is a desk sawed in half full of
cardboard for years for years I have
pursued silent computing and in the end
Thunderbolt was the answer no amount of
water cooling ever made it quite giddy
and people asked me July this why would
you care about having a window on a
record case that's why suckas that's why
because that looks flippin awesome so
this one's actually relatively tested I
have at least tried the a soos
Thunderbolt card on this one let's just
give her the old reboot and see what
happens
maybe someone was just jostled loose and
chipping and I can just help hello okay
let's find our board post code a team's
CPU fan error
oh that's a big deal have a seat eat
that water cool theory we should be fine
this time let's go out there you're
going to cut out all this stuff so that
you just show the part where I'm like ah
it goes okay wait a minute how car bars
almost finicky
Oh crying Oh Matt well there we go just
like that my friends Hey look at that
g-sync showed up working right away
g-sync display connected so it looks
like the DisplayPort connection doesn't
care at all that it's running through
what is this like a 30-foot optical
Thunderbolt cable working awesome
so there you have it all that remains to
be done now and all the noise stays in
there speaking of which
