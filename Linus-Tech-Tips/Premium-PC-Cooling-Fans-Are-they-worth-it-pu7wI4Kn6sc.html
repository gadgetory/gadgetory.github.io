- and I like our premium fans and we're
both quite public about being fans of
Noctua and with pretty good reason octo
is able to boast extremely high build
quality great thermal performance and
very low operating decibel levels lately
they've even addressed the issue of
their kind of puke Brown problem by
introducing their Redux and especially
their industrial PPC line of fans which
I'm a big fan of but they're pretty
crazy expensive if you think about it in
many cases people are buying these
premium fans to replace fans that are
already installed in their case or that
come with a radiator by default is it
really worth it though there's a price /
performance value of swapping your fans
really make any sense in this case or
should we be more focused on investing
in different parts of our computer we
decided to find out let's start with our
test setup we have an NZXT h4 40 with
his defaults fan setup of 3 120
millimeter fans in the front and 1 140
millimeter fan in the back then we have
a corsair at h 105 with its to default
120 millimeter fan strapped to it up in
the top of the case which will be
cooling at i 749 30k when we switch to
nock to a fans we're replacing all of
the 120 millimeter fans with n FF 12s
and we will replace the 140 millimeter
fan in the back with an NFA 14 first off
we have our thermal testing our 49 30 K
is running at stock and as per usual our
Idol test will be ran with minimal
processes running in the background our
load test is ran with prime95 running
small FFT mode just to stress out the
CPU a little bit and get that heat
flowing in both thermal and audio test
cases the fans are running at about
eleven hundred rpm for the stock and the
Noctua
aftermarket fans secondly we have the
audio test case this was done by
shutting off everything in range that
could make noise that means straight up
on plugging pretty much all electron
in the area and even going as far as
unplugging the fridge that was on the
floor below just because it was slightly
too close I then set up our X tech
digital sound level meter and recorded
it with a camera just to make sure
everything went okay as I wanted to
leave the room just in case the sound
meter would pick up my breathing
so essentially yeah there was a little
pervert awesome but maybe not the 204
dollars worth of improvement that you
were hoping to get this money could
easily be shifted into other parts of
your computer for a more noticeable
performance improvement in most cases a
lot of things in the computer modding
world aren't exactly worth it in a price
/ performance sense and while I can sit
here in bash on performance fans there
are other culprits as well
do-it-yourself water cooling isn't
exactly the biggest reward for your
investment either especially if you're a
fan of buying premium components and
this brings me to the conclusion I've
known what the results of this test
would yield for quite a while and I'm
sure many of you watching knew as well
but that doesn't stop people like Linus
and I from water cooling our computers
and outfitting them with top-of-the-line
fans and other stuff like that but this
doesn't exactly have the greatest price
/ performance ratios and that's okay
with us if you're on a tight budget and
trying to build a gaming rig that will
ultimately live under your desk you
should probably just focus on your core
components in this case if you're a fan
of performance components and
essentially the computer version of a
hot-rodder then it's probably fine for
you to torch your wallet a little bit
and invest in premium stuff like premium
fans and water cooling all right guys so
what do you think of premium setups are
you into that are you just buying like
extremely gaming optimized ones that are
as low cost as you can get while getting
the highest performance out of it that
you can get let me know in the comments
down below while you're down there like
favorite dislikes subscribe share all
that kind of stuff if you want to do
that in another place as well jump over
to the forum and do it there and if you
don't like the ads become a contributor
as normal if you want a shirt for some
reason check the link in the description
down below and can get an awesome
looking shirt there I think we have our
better than useless shirts on sale there
I know a guy that actually works here
recently bought one so that's pretty
cool thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
