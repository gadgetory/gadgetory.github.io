going to show you how to encrypt a
volume on your computer and that can be
kind of like a like a container like a
folder that you'd put a bunch of stuff
in or it can be in the form of an entire
Drive in your PC or even something like
a removable Drive so it's done at a
partition level and we're going to start
with how to create that container so the
first thing you do is use TrueCrypt
basically thumbs up true kip kripp does
things right you want to never save
history that's important
click create volume here you get a bunch
of different options so we're going to
show you the create encrypted file
container although create a non screen
crypt and non-system partitions flash
drive is a good one as well and it has a
couple slightly different steps that
will show you at the end we're going to
use a standard TrueCrypt volume a hidden
TrueCrypt volume is a little bit
different from a standard one so what
that is is it's an encrypted it's an
encrypted container that has an
encrypted container within it that's
invisible so if you guys understand what
that means it's like if someone had a
gun to your head and was like let me
into that encrypted folder or I'm going
to pop you one you know and stuff then
you could give them the password for
that one and they would actually think
you put some fake stuff in there so they
would think they're getting your
important stuff but it's actually within
another container inside of it so that's
probably unnecessary for 99% of people
unless you're like the CEO of you know
Toyota and you have a new car coming
that's better than all of your other
cars and you don't want people to know
about it ok so you create a volume
location select a file so we're going to
we have we have one that we created
already as a test so this is just going
to be the test 1 save and this file you
can put anywhere in the computer won't
even know what to do with it if you
double-click on it it'll just ask how to
open it and it won't ya won't know what
to do never save history and you can
hide that anywhere you can throw it in
like a system folder you can even keep
it on the desktop because it won't look
like anything you could call it a and it
wouldn't be descriptive at all for
encryption algorithm use AES and the
default hash algorithm is also fine
click Next you can specify the size of
your volume much like a folder you can
just say ok we're going to create this
sort of this container that's going to
be 10 gigs big and that's what we can
put in there so we're going to create
one that's 10 gigs
it shows you how much free
space you have on the drive where you
created the container next password okay
password creation lots of special
characters are good it has a limit of 64
characters but some of the strongest
passwords and easiest to remember could
actually be a phrase like Capitol Rumble
the cat is a good pet is actually an
extremely strong password because of how
many characters it is you can confirm it
Rumble the cat is a good pet and then
you can actually display password to
make sure that you typed it correctly as
you were going next large files do you
want large files I would pretty much go
with yes because that's just the the
file system that it's using so we're an
NTFS this stage is important you want to
move your mouse around as randomly as
possible because computers can't be
completely random they just don't work
that way and they want you to kind of
make it more random by being random
about the way that you move the mouse so
there you go that's about as random as I
think I can be the longer you go the
stronger the volume will be so if you
want to sit there for an hour you could
but I suspect there's a law of
diminishing returns at some point there
now we format our encrypted volume and
yay SSD and fast processors it is
creating itself at around 600 megabytes
per second so we'll be able to come back
and well you know what Matt whatever you
guys can just chill you know what's a
good joke you hear the one about the
actually I don't
I can't think of any jokes right now
you're the one about the SSD that raced
a hard drive they beat it and I'm
getting like the thumbs up from slick do
you hear the one about the mechanical
keyboard that died and I'm getting the
sad face from slick and apparently it's
a live now so slicks keyboard is fine
there we go and we're done so now what
we're going to do is go into our
Documents folder be done okay you know
what it doesn't matter because I can
show you guys the other one I created so
here legitimate g-rated movies is right
here in some file it's five gigs if you
double click on it it has no idea what
to do with it so the way that you act
access it is you go to there we go that
one's done now so you only click next if
you want to create another one so
actually yeah I said I'd do that at the
end so let's do this first so mounting a
drive look ok so you enter a hold on
yeah you have to select a file first so
we're going to go with legitimate
g-rated movies we are going to mount it
to drive letter M so this one was this
strong password ok yeah this oh I don't
think I capitalized ok no really this is
a good way to do it there we go so now
it is mounted in Drive M so now our
computer actually just sees it as a
normal disk so you can see that there
are legitimate g-rated movies inside if
we wanted to create a on tintin other--
encrypted volume we would just select
another drive letter select a different
file such as test one and click mount
typing in ah Rumble the cat is a good
pet and that one is now mounted in drive
letter oh there you go there's our 10
gig volume now the procedure is slightly
different for something like a USB Drive
so in this case we're going to take it
one step further by not only encrypting
our volume but also having it hidden
inside a pen so this USB Drive is going
to go into the computer somehow there we
go
ok that did not fit that well so we're
going to go ahead and put it in that one
alright so removable disk II encrypt a
non system part ok so we're going to
create a standard one again we're going
to select our device so you actually
select the partition right there
partition one 3.7 gigs which is
essentially the whole Drive you can
select a whole Drive but it won't work
if you already have partitions on it
click Next create encrypted volume and
format it there we go and from there all
of the options are pretty much the same
it takes a while to create the encrypted
partition on a USB Drive because they're
so slow so what we've done is we've
finished that
I'm going to go ahead and plug this in
now there's a couple different ways that
you can access them you can see here you
need to format the disk and drive-e
before you can use it if you format it
it will format it it'll wipe it because
Windows doesn't know what to do with
this encrypted volume on here so a
couple different things you can do you
can auto mount devices so that TrueCrypt
will look for it and help windows find
it or you can select a device and go
manually to the device and mount I
actually forget the password for this
what was the password for this one no it
wasn't like this is a good this is a
strong password we know was the remember
one it was the rumble rumble is a good
pet know Rumble is a good cat whatever
the point is if someone doesn't know
your password it'll take them years and
years and years to brute-force this so
make sure that you remember your
password or you're going to end up in a
situation like this and you cannot get
it back very important don't forget to
