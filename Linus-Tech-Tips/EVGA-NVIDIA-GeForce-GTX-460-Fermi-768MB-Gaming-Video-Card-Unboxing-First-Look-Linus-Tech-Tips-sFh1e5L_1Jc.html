exciting product from EVGA this is the
GeForce GTX 460 so that is 20 less than
the GTX 480 10 less than the GTX 470 and
only 5 less than the GTX 460 5 but the
performance of the 460 is actually very
very close to its big brother the 465
and it's quite a lot cheaper now it does
have less ram so that means that high
resolutions you might be a little bit
limited in terms of running like huge
anti-aliasing on high resolutions but
with the price of this card you're
probably not going to be running at 2560
by 1600 with a 30-inch monitor anyway so
I'm going to go ahead and start breaking
the seals here so the GTX 460 5 or 460
is a bit of a change from the other
Fermi based cards in that Nvidia has
actually reworked the architecture of
this card quite a bit that means that
power consumption is down heat output is
down and performance is up versus some
of the other 400 series cards it also
means that the price is down so this is
around $200 u.s. and that puts it
securely in a sort of value enthusiastic
a more price point if such a thing
existed so here's a little Quick Start
Guide next we have a graphics card user
guide okay so that shows us some super
basics talks about e VJs advanced our
May program talks a little bit about
their precision software which is for
overclocking that's a pretty good value
add as well as EVGA social networks ok
cool go ahead and put that down we've
got an EVGA sticker as well as an EVGA
driver disk don't use this driver disk
on the latest off the Nvidia website woo
that's a nice sticker EVGA GeForce GTX
400 US so I could put it there if I
wanted to but I don't next let's go and
have a look at the part itself so I
haven't seen an EVGA box like this
before looks like they've redesign
things a little bit in terms of
accessories we've got a mini HDMI to
HDMI dongle we have a dual molex to one
PCIe 6
pin dongle then we have to molex to one
PCIe 6s ok so we have 2 of those then we
have a DVI to VGA adapter and that's it
then we have the card itself it's quite
a bit smaller than the each other GTX
400 series cards because all of the
other cards despite having different
model names are based on the same core
and most of them are even based on the
same PCB even if the coolers are
slightly different this one however is
based on a much smaller PCB so it ends
up being a much smaller card and it's
also a smaller core so you can see where
the where the GPU core actually is on
the back of the GPU back of the video
card see GPU and video card I use these
terms interchangeably but the GPU is
actually the graphics processing unit
there and the video card is the whole
thing with a PCB which in this case is
black a GPU on it Ram on it all that
good stuff so at the top we're going to
find an SLI connector it is sli ready
but it does not support 3-way SLI
because per 3-way SLI you would need two
sli connectors we have an 80 millimeter
fan on the front and you can see that
it's using a flower style heatsink that
is actually here cameraman just look at
that card for a second we back it
actually closely resembles the stock
intel heatsink where you've got a copper
core at the back and in this case we can
see there is a copper base with a couple
of heat pipes attached to it and then
it's got like this radial fin thing
going on and I've actually seen intel
heat sinks that are shaped exactly like
that so it looks like you know it's a
bit of a tribute to Intel's thermal
engineer so that yes that design does
work we've got two heat pipes coming out
here and presumably coming over here
where there's more heat sink and over
here and presumably coming out over
there so you can actually see yes there
is additional heatsink material past
that little flower shape and that's
having heat transported to it by the
heat pipe so here we've got PCI Express
16x connector
and at the back of the card it still
does pull back a fair bit of power but
that's what you generally expect from a
$200 plus gaming card so you need to
6-pin PCI Express connectors and let's
have a look at what we've got in terms
of camera man what are you doing oh
you're looking down the spout okay well
I haven't looked there yet so I don't
know what's there but I guess in here
I'll look through the camera - oh we can
see the heatsink okay hold on I'm going
to look oh yeah yeah yeah you can see
where the heat pipe attaches to that
heat sink in there cool all right so
let's turn around and see what we've got
in terms of output connectors so we have
two DVI and one HDMI connector now this
card does support Nvidia surround as
well as 3d vision technology so bearing
in mind though that you would need two
cards to run surround gaming so you can
only use two of these three connectors
at any given time thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the EVGA GeForce GTX
460 768 Meg version bearing in mind
there is a 1 gig version that will
perform slightly better due to extra
memory as well as extra memory bandwidth
the cameraman pointed out to me this is
actually a bumper sticker so you would
apply it to your bumper like so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
