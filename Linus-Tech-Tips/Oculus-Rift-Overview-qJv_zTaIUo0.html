welcome to our oculus rift video if you
are just here for Crystal Cove be sure
to check the timestamp in the
description of this video if you are
also here for Crystal Cove and the
developers kit just continue to keep
watching and we'll jump into that right
away when you first open the box you're
presented with the actual oculus headset
the control box which you end up
plugging most of the things into hdmi
cable for the control box and a DVI HDMI
converter just in case you need it a
power cable for the control box as well
a USB cable for the control box as well
a set of three lenses both a B and C
which are very important I'll get into
that later and some travel adapters just
in case because they are shipping this
all over the world view glasses users
out there there are adjustments on each
side of the headset so you can change
the distance of the lenses and the
screen that can be done with a coin or a
flathead screwdriver or something like
that but if you can use contacts that is
recommended as wearing glasses will
reduce your field of vision and there is
potential that the lenses could come in
contact with the glasses and in turn
scratch the control box is relatively
simple it's fixed to the oculus via
cable and four buttons it has power
brightness up-and-down to contrast up
and down in terms of i/o there's HDMI
DVI USB and power and that's about it
one really nice thing about the control
box and headset combo is that you can
actually cable manage the cable to go
around the side of your head and then
down the back that way if you put the
control box in a good position you could
replace their six foot HDMI cable with a
very long one and have a power bar
something like that and make it so
you're a little bit more mobile so you
can spin in your chair very easily
without the cable getting caught on
anything if you have an oculus rift or
if you're planning on getting one in the
future I would highly suggest going to
rift enabled comm they have a very good
database of all the games that are
compatible with oculus rift and their
search function is awesome so you have a
Kinect and a Hydra and a rift you can
tell it that and then it'll tell you all
the games that can work with those
different devices so you know exactly
what you're getting yourself into
another annoying thing is having the
video feed for the oculus go somewhere
that isn't the oculus so to fix this
what you can do is go to the executable
file for the game that you're trying to
run right click on it and create a new
shortcut right click on the shortcut go
to properties and under the target text
field after the very last quotation
at space - adapter space and then
whatever number you have your oculus
plugged into for video output slot on
your graphics card for me it's number
one so I just have space - adapter space
one but that'll be whatever you have
yours plugged into and this will tell
the game exactly what adapter or screen
it's supposed to run - and that will
push it directly to your oculus now I
have spent a gratuitous amount of time
with my oculus rift I love this thing
and thanks to rift enabled I've been
able to find a ton of different games to
try and it has been extremely fun but
it's not ready it's a Developer Kit it's
not the final version it's not the
consumer version we know this but the
observations with the developer kit is
don't be way too excited about the
developer kit be super ridiculously
excited about oculus and VR in general
but not necessarily the developer kit
because you still can definitely see the
pixel grid it does totally look like
you're looking through a screen door you
can see space in between the pixels I
can't stress that enough it's not
perfect there's also some features that
will be in the consumer version that are
not in the dev kit enter Crystal Cove
where the 1080p prototype brought us
very obviously to 1080p from 720p on the
dev kit the Crystal Cove upgrades are
not quite as obvious it's still a 1080p
panel but it is a OLED panel with low
persistence which is actually extremely
important and I'll talk about that later
the more obvious part is the ir
positional tracking on the camera which
leaves you with those IR LEDs all over
the front and is obviously the reason
for the name Crystal Cove the positional
tracking works by having a camera watch
your oculus where there's the IR LEDs
and so it can tell how it moves which is
amazing because now you can lean forward
you can lean around before you were
essentially a camera on a tripod that
had wheels you were moving around but it
was very fixed you could turn how you
were looking and you could look up and
down but that's about it you couldn't
really lean now you feel a lot more
human and that massively increases the
immersion if you want to lean over and
pick something up it works if you reel
backwards your character will reel
backwards as if you are scared it feels
much more natural and breaks the whole
boundary thing where it doesn't really
feel like you're playing virtual reality
because your character
isn't actually moving with you now for
micro movements your character will move
with you which is amazing in an
interview with oculus it was said that
the display is turning off in between
frames to help with motion blur taking
that and the fact that it's an OLED
display if you go on blur Busters and
check out their OLED display motion blur
article which is actually quite good
it'll talk about how this works so what
they're probably using is point samples
instead of sample-and-hold and the idea
of this is it will put an image on
screen and then turn the display off so
it doesn't sit there for too long
creating motion blur and they're not
guessing what should be there which is
really problematic for VR experiences as
well which would also cause motion blur
and the strobing is so fast robing as in
turning off and on not yeah other terms
of strobing it's it's so fast that you
won't notice it yourself which is
actually quite a good experience and
will help you a lot with reading text
and will help a lot with that that
motion blur problem that the previous
versions of oculus have had so
essentially be excited be super excited
