the fractal design define our for
computer case as you can see this case
has a very ugly box but I'm gonna hope
that this is more of a story of the
beauty within than a story of the beauty
whip out and see the funny thing is that
as a whole
Oh for crying out loud give me a sec
guys sorry about that guys
had to fix the other TV there so you can
see we have a fractal design logo on the
TV behind me which is of course
appropriate for a fractal design case
unboxing very appropriate indeed yeah
there we go alright so what does happen
what do they say about themselves on the
yet so they've done away with the silver
case color so it's available in black
white and titanium supports ATX micro
ATX or mini ITX cases ah motherboards
it's minimalistic elegant and that's
something we've come to expect from the
Defiant series patent pending mod you
vent is something we've come to expect
so basically what is this this is an
evolutionary change not a revolutionary
change fractal is going for ah just the
define r3 plus I guess so they've
updated the internals in a big way but
I'm not expecting the outside of the
case to really look very different at
all packing material wise its side
prefer to see a soft foam but more and
more we're seeing manufacturers go with
hard foam because they do present a bit
of a better value on the manufacturing
side so well they're going with them
included as a user's manual to find our
for computer case very good stuff as
well as a plastic cover so from the
outside sort of any immediate
similarities that you might notice
between the define our for and the
define our three are obviously not
present you know this doesn't look
anything like a define our three which
clearly didn't look anything like a
define
- and of course I'm being very um sort
of very very ironic here so it looks
pretty much like a define our three from
the outside for front aisle we've got
our power indicator we've got our
microphone headphone and reset button
that's not a headphone button that's a
jack but that's a button power button I
mentioned that before with cool little
concentric circle finish on it USB 3
SuperSpeed ports two USB 2 not super
speed ports two front panel five and a
quarter inch bays sound dampening
material inside the front panel here
this is actually very important for
sound sound dampening oh cool built-in
fan controller 12 volt seven volt five
volt
awesome those are the only things you
really need any fans of the go all the
way down to five volt fantastic the
hydraulic bearing fans that are included
should do it there is a 140 in the back
and a 140 in the front they've updated
this a little bit so that's kind of
interesting so now instead of being on a
swinging door this is actually this
actually swings down does it or hold on
look it's uh Oh give me a sec guys okay
so yeah we got had a bit of a clearance
issue there but I just kind of tuck this
in so there's a removable fan filter
right here which sort of comes out
somehow and serve like that that's
probably not how you do it dual 140 or
120 millimeter fans these are there are
two fans with the hydraulic bearings
that I mentioned before that are
included and so I talked about the
filter already talked about the yes so
there's a grill here and then they also
have access to air through the vents
that are on the side so you can go and
have a look at that vent while I figure
out how to get this filter back in place
I'm really sure this isn't how I'm
supposed to do it but I'm just kind of
like bending it in so if you do it my
way then sort of you're doing it wrong
but I'm trying to film it unboxing here
not you know bait the Mona Lisa so maybe
I don't do things the most elegant way
I'm very very sorry
mod you may this is a cool technology
the first time I saw mod you vent was
with the define r2 and basically see
these these are fan holes but there's
like nothing that
goes through them because there are
actual pieces of sound dampening
material that are screwed in you can
take these screws out you can put a
couple of 140 millimeter fans up there
and it is off to the races on the side
you've got another mod you vent so this
one supports either a 120 or 140
millimeter fan directly over where your
graphics cards would be if you had
graphics cards in your system in the
back you see a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
valve mount more just general venting
holes 7 PCI slots with one auxilary one
that you could use for like a fan
controller or something like that bottom
mounted power supply with sound
dampening material the Defiant series is
all about quiet computing so let's go
ahead and get it opened up and I'll be
right back now define our 3s a little on
the heavy side for its size so when you
open it up you realize it's because they
spent money on the sound dampening
material so the side panels are
phenomenally heavy because they have
this thick dense material here that
helps to Dedmon noise that gets made
inside your case so that combined with
the sound deadening material that's
built into the front panel means that
any sound usually gets kind of projected
out the back or out those vents on the
side and you're not as likely to hear it
they have seriously upgraded the cable
management room and the define are for
compared to the define r3 there is
enough room that you can easily route a
24-pin cable back here
lots of cable management anchors so you
won't have any difficulty routing things
wherever you need them to go outside of
the holes here they've also put in a
larger than usual bottom power supply
cable grommet and what that means is
that all the cables that need to come up
here will actually be able to fit I've
seen cases that have ones that are only
about this size so while you've got lots
of room to cable manage up here there's
not enough room to actually bring the
cables up to the top of the case the
included fans have very nice file very
high-quality sleeping on them you can't
even see the color of the wires at all
this has colored wires inside it guys
you can see up here but this looks
that's some of the tightest mesh I've
seen from anything but like murder mod
it's fantastic
ok and I think that pretty much does it
for the backside your CPU cutout is here
where
you would expect to find it on the other
side of the CPU part of the motherboard
tray and let's go ahead open up this
side so here you can see the mod you
vent so this has like a sound dampening
phone hooha thing going on you just go
ahead and remove that and throw in a fan
if you feel the desire very heavy as
well just due to the to the sound
dampening material they have seriously
upgraded the internals of the defined
series as well so we still have room for
eight hard drives see that one two three
four five six seven eight
however they've given the option to
completely remove five of them if you
don't want to mount a ton of drives and
you want to create more room in your
case for cooling an airflow see that now
those four hundred and forty millimeter
fans have lots of room to blow air from
the vents here into the inside of the
case and you've got room for much longer
graphics card so you could install a
graphics card that's like I mean come on
it would be it an entire Linus forearm
and almost a Linus hand in length by the
time it actually touched this fan which
seems to be on some kind of a there we
go that's clipped in a little bit better
now oh that explains it so it looks like
this came a little bit loose and
shipping you know what let's go ahead
and do some Linus tech tips
investigation of what's going on with
that front mechanism thing that has been
causing problems for me could you get
the front closed
okay so just pull this off and you can
see that we get access to all of the
pieces here so this whole thing comes
out look at that so you just clip the
fans in here you can remove the fan
filter much more easily now that I've
done it sort of the way that you're
supposed to then you take this whole
mechanism put it back inside here run
your cables around the back where there
is tons of room here come around the
other side this is fantastic
so there's tons of room for cable
management back you know you can't reach
kick come we're plugged in guys tons of
room for cable management here and then
you just go and pick the whole thing and
clip it right into place like that so
now it isn't going anywhere and we're
not going to have any more trouble with
it awesome
ah another thing they've upgraded about
the interior check this out guys is that
you can not only take this out and do
this but you can take it out and do this
haha so you can rotate it that gives you
more airflow through here if you haven't
filled it up with hard drives or even if
you have in all likelihood because a lot
of people complain about this style but
in order to get enough strength once you
fill this up with hard drives you have
to have enough reinforcement material
here but you can go ahead and put it in
that way in order to reorient the drive
cages however you see fit now the bottom
one yep you can remove that one as well
which is very very cool so there's that
bottom mounted 120 or 140 millimeter
which has one long fan filter that can
be taken up from the back there we go so
that covers both this fan and the bottom
of the power supply you can see the
cable management more clearly from here
you can also see the mod you vents that
are in the top of the case so what have
they upgraded removable cages both this
one in this one although this one
doesn't look like you can reorient it no
I kind of doubt it although I could be
wrong I hope I'm not wrong ah SSD mounts
is that is that an SSD mount on the
bottom I don't know I don't what this
holes for maybe you can reorient it
whenever someone will look it up and
they'll make it the top comment and
someone will thumbs it up and then - it
looks stupid but he doesn't feel that
bad about it so don't worry guys go
ahead thumbs it up make it the top
comment and we'll know if you can rotate
that or not you can rotate this one to
five and a quarters I'll right right
what have they upgraded so the rotating
cages the removable cages the actually
much better design for the front fans
and filters the integrated fan
controller so there's a molex connector
right here and then you've got a number
looks like three the number three four I
don't know a number reset switch ah
you've got a number of fans that can be
plugged into that in order to control
most of the fans in your case just very
very cool you've also got USB 3 natively
USB 2 front audio these are all nicely
black cables that'll go into your
motherboard and look really sleek so
they've added bright 140 millimeter fans
horde at the back I mean yeah so
evolutionary changes little steps is
this a better case so to define our
three absolutely was to define our three
already a kick-butt
case absolutely 100% tick but in spite
of the lack of motherboard tray that's a
cheap shot okay
cable management smells some rubber
grommets for oh cool the include rubber
grommets for the fans that's outstanding
one of that lots of isolating roads on
it and all of the screws that you need
to assemble your case thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the define are for from fractal
design honestly to find our three is one
of my favorite cases so this only makes
it better don't forget to subscribe to -
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and just in case
you didn't already know it includes
rubber isolating mounts for your three
and a half inch drives and all of these
sleds are fully two and a half inch
drive compatible again don't forget to
subscribe it's really important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
