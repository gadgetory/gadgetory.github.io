unboxing of Anna soos minimax a home
entertainment center what I think they
actually mean is 8310 n tr3 310 3 on t -
i so this is a mini ITX motherboard that
is designed as you may or may not be
able to figure out for home
entertainment use and his fan less and
quiet is amplifier friendly okay
it will run full HD video it has home
theater gate and it is slim I think by
slim they mean Mini ITX let's flip it
over to the back where we can see a
picture of the board we can see that
this board runs and we have dual channel
ddr3 it has full HD playback fanless
design oh and DTS so that's what they
mean by amplifier friendly is Windows 7
ready
it features an Intel Atom dual core 330
processor and Nvidia ion so here it has
a user's guide with it
with the drivers and applications DVD
which you should throw away and download
the latest from the well I guess the
Isuzu website then we have an i/o shield
we have two SATA cables so it's a fairly
bare-bones accessory package but a soos
has not skimp when it comes to the
actual quality of the product itself
fanless as you guys may or may not know
is actually far more expensive to
produce than something with a fan and
the reason for that is that this hunk of
metal costs an awful lot more than a
much smaller hunk of metal and a little
whiny fan on top of it so I applaud a
soos for making an effort to make their
home theater solutions run fanless
alright so let's have a look at the
overall layout of the board we have our
CPU and GPU both situated under this
fanless heatsink we've got our ddr3
memory slots two of them over here on
the right-hand edge we have a 24 pin
power connector and what I imagine is
probably a fairly decent location for it
although many ITX
cases have very different internal
layouts so it's hard to say what is the
ideal location we have a PCI Express 16x
slot down here at the bottom although I
really can
imagine that you did install a
high-powered graphics card in a
motherboard such as that but just for
giggles because this is my video blog
and because I do as I please
I am going to install a GTX 580 on this
motherboard so the GTX 580 as you can
plainly see is about the thighs of the
motherboard and fits in pretty nicely so
if you have a mini ITX case that
supports uh you know video cards that
are like 4 and 1/2 inches longer than
the motherboard itself then you can go
ahead and you can install a GTX 580 in
your 83 ion see - I if I can get it out
without a degree there we go alright so
let's keep going
we've got SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports 4 of them we have 2 front USB
headers and what I cannot imagine would
be an ideal location because it's going
to be pretty hard to access those yeah
but that's ok I'm sure you'll only have
to do it once we have three fan
connectors which are also in a very very
very odd location but you like I said
you're probably only going to access at
once I wouldn't worry too much about it
on the back we've got our output options
so we have ps2 well input 2 I suppose we
have a ps2 keyboard port we have six USB
2.0 ports VGA and HDMI this is actually
a pretty good mix because it gives you
that legacy connection and then it also
gives you HDMI which can easily be
adapted to DVI we have optical audio out
Gigabit Ethernet and then we have simple
ancient 5.1 audio which I actually don't
mind because on the system like this
you're probably going to be using the
audio out over HDMI anyhow so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the 83
ion T - I don't forget to subscribe to
