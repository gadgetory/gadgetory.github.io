the 30-inch monitor that we used to get
our 2560 by 1600 or 1600 pieper formance
results you can consider these pretty
close to what you'd get if you ran at
2560 by 1440 the difference actually
isn't all that much and we are all about
the geforce gtx titan today this is the
fastest single GPU card BarNone so what
that means is compared to dual GPU
solutions such as the 660ti sli that we
also ran and the Asus Ares 2 which we
also ran which basically amounts to 270
970 gigahertz edition cards you will get
consistently good performance so
somewhere between a single GPU and two
GPUs because those ones rely on driver
optimizations one of the other things
that's interesting about Titan from a
large format and high resolution
perspective is the fact that it has six
gigs of GPU memory which means not only
will one Titan perform extremely well at
high res but several titans will perform
extremely well at high res Titan seeks
to do a few things keep acoustics low
keep temperatures reasonable deliver
outstanding performance and do it all
with one GPU and reasonable power
consumption so we're going to be
analyzing some of those other things in
other videos and this video is focused
on the performance at greater than 1080p
resolution now I did a full 1080p review
as well and there's a 57 60 by 1080
surround review as well so let's have a
look at Crysis so crisis was always a
challenge this is Crysis 1 by the way no
Crysis 2 and it continues to be a
challenge so that our single GPU card
however it runs at almost 60 FPS average
in Crysis one at 2560 by 1600 crisis has
officially been conquered this is at
DirectX 10 very high presets eight times
NSAA with motion blur off the only thing
that beats the Titan in Crysis is the
Aries - so that's the dual 7970 solution
and you
see that the Titan actually performs
almost twice as well as a GTX 680 part
of this could be due to the fact that it
has a much larger frame buffer although
I doubt it because Christ has only used
up about one gig of VRAM whereas the
rest of it is probably due to the fact
that it has about 2.6 rather 7.1 billion
transistors with 2600 CUDA cores so
moving right along
yeah Titan performs pretty well but it's
about the same as gtx 660 sli which
starts to look like a pretty good value
here this is an example of how well
optimised sli scaling and games that
don't demand too much in terms of video
memory can perform really well compared
to the titan at a lower price crysis 3
was just released so this one is a very
very interesting case study you can see
here the aries 2 demonstrates why
sometimes dual GPU solutions are not the
answer the titan tops the performance
charts beating out the 660ti sli
solution but not by much destroying the
gtx 680 again performing almost dumb
well not quite almost double but 75%
better than a gtx 680 with the ares two
actually coming in behind a single 7970
now the reason for that can be any
number of things the aries ii uses a
special driver because it's not a
standard AMD card so a soos has their
own driver so sometimes that can be a
little bit behind in terms of
optimization it could be crossfire
profiles I've seen online that people
are finding better success with you know
using random crossfire profiles but we
were using the default ones and yeah so
sometimes a dual GPU solution can
perform the same as a single one or even
worse which is one of the reasons why I
personally always recommend a single GPU
solution when you can however when you
look at the performance in this game
660ti looks like a pretty good value
considering it performs ninety percent
as well as a Titan but actually costs
about sixty-five percent as much and you
can also get 660ti Zin 3 gig
configurations far cry 3 another high
performance title another high
resolution result here so the Ares two
and 660ti sli come out way ahead on
any of the single GPU solutions probably
the most impressive thing on this put on
this particular chart right here I think
slicks waiting for a video card here
have a 7970 is the 7970 that I just
handed slick the 7970 beats the GTX 680
by almost 30% only losing to the only
other single GPU card in our test which
is the Titan and that was only by about
20% so it takes a dual GPU solution both
Nvidia and AMD scaled incredibly well in
this game with Nvidia getting about
almost double the scaling and AMD
getting about about 50 60 % scaling so
that's very very very cool stuff to see
but definite nod to AMD and definite nod
to dual GPU solutions here again a game
where perhaps the sixth gig frame buffer
is not a benefit to the Titan Skyrim now
Skyrim we're not running the same way we
used to we've added a whole bunch of
mods about 18 mods from the Steam
Workshop making it much more demanding
than it is in its bone-stock
configuration which is what we used to
run and that's part of the reason why
when I used to show these performance
graphs you'd never really see any
difference between the cards now that
has all changed the big winner here
again is 660ti sli with titan coming up
next gtx 680 coming up next and the AMD
cards bringing up the rear so this is a
game that seems to be better optimized
for NVIDIA although that could be a
function of the mods we're running
actually running better on NVIDIA so we
just selected mods that we thought
looked really good and kind of went from
there
battlefield 3 getting to be a bit of an
older game but still very telling so the
Ares 3 remember this one has three gigs
per GP as I say Ares 3 I'm in Ares 2 has
3 gigs of ram per GPU so once again
we're running into a situation where we
don't need that six gigs yet however as
4k resolution starts becoming more
popular or if you want to run surround
that might be more of a factor but when
you don't need the extra RAM more GPU
horsepower seems to really work out for
you and in this particular game the
areas to performed almost double as well
as a single 7970 making it by far the
ruler of the roost in battlefield 3 best
possible solution you could get very
similar results by using dual 79 7
at a much more reasonable price as well
which is part of the reason that you
shouldn't just completely ignore the
Aries - on the graphs because that
solution is available for it less than
the cost of a Titan not necessarily more
than the Aries to actually costs about
five hundred six hundred dollars more
than a GeForce GTX Titan so the Titan
comes in a tie with the 660ti SLI which
again is because we didn't need the vram
with the other two single GPU solutions
bringing up the rear
once again Metro 2033 is a very
interesting case study excellent scaling
again double the performance of a single
7970 with the ares 2 highlighting why
dual GPU solutions are often very
awesome however looking at the 660ti
compared to the 680 we see why dual GPU
solutions aren't always necessarily that
great Titan puts up a great showing
again just destroying the numbers from
the GTX 680 beating it by about 50 60 %
here which r2 is the last game in our
suite and I made a bit of a mistake on
the graph but you guys won't know that
because I'll fix it before I show it to
you so don't worry about it so which or
two at 1600 feet ultra preset including
uber sampling really didn't give as much
of an edge to the Titan as I had thought
because Titan relies on lots of VRAM and
uber sampling just are rather tight and
relies on lots of VRAM to separate
itself from dual GPU solutions which are
- I thought would demand more vram
because of the fact that we had over
sampling on but the Ares 2 pulls away
from everything else in which or - just
proving that sometimes just more GPU
horsepower is better than more memory or
a larger single GPU however the Titan
does put up a pretty good showing again
tying the 660ti and beating the GTX 680
by about 50% so what does all of this
mean it means that looking at current
resolutions like 2560 by 1600 if you're
only running a single monitor you may
actually not get $1,000 worth of benefit
with a GTX Titan especially when you
compare it to solutions like two gtx
660ti is in sli or two competing cards
running in crossfire however if you were
to run a multi-way configuration
titin would be the solution to go with
because running a multi-way
configuration presumably you're running
at a very high resolution whether it's
4k or whether it's in surround and
that's where you'll hopefully start to
benefit from the additional RAM and the
other situation where Titan starts to
make sense is in a small form-factor
configuration aries to pulled a good
couple hundred more watts from the power
supply than tighten that does show up on
your power bill and that does affect
both the heat output as well as the
noise of your system so Titan is a great
solution if you're looking to build a
compact gaming rig so this is another
situation where dual 660 TI's might not
make sense because you need at least
four expansion slots to even fit those
so do you have to pay a premium for that
single GPU single card high performance
solution yes but if you're trying to
work within a confined space if you're
trying to get more V RAM or if you're a
professional who wants to make use of
the fact that the double precision for
floating-point performance of this card
is not crippled like it was on previous
generation consumer models then
something like a Titan might make sense
