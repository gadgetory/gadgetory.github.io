gonna be fun
today's video has one objective and one
objective only in addition to the other
objective that we also have so we
actually brought Luke in just totally
last minute dick are you monitoring
audio or anything
no yeah hopefully it's fine whatever
anyway well point is he's here for a
wine show today yeah and he like walked
over and he was like what are you guys
doing hey I like the walk that's how we
both like I just pretend to walk like a
whoo man for the camera yeah I'm like oh
yes put left foot and forward don't hold
shoulders like this you know anyone like
Waze de the the game from forever ago
when you had to try to make the person
walk in so here okay we're gonna move
whatever this crap they put on Google is
away and why do you have two keyboards
Jake well one is for the mineral oil OPC
if nothing that's just okay we have one
ready here then this one is for the
swimming cart Oh for the favorite card
but we also have a stream deck now hey
check that out that keyboard that Jake
just took away we can go like this boom
so this is it I need to adjust the
framing a little yeah yeah we're gonna
need to adjust that framing a little
thanks Jake so this is it yeah the
original mineral oil cooled computer
that you and I built over three years
ago it's kind of spooky isn't that good
yeah that's great so there's actually
been a couple of changes since then so
it looks pretty silly yeah it broke so
you're good happy
this was actually working for probably
oh man how long was it working no did we
move it like right when it right when we
finished it no I can't remember
no it existed in the in the house for a
while and then we moved it to the new
office on the truck then we movie we
were just using it as a prop though yeah
right and then was it when I first got
my new office like my office is your
office
I was like yeah I'm gonna daily drive
that thing so manly worked I remember
that a long time but then the leaking we
went to move it I realized that it had
been leaking so a hairline crack had
developed in the mineral oil cooled
computer shown where I'm not too soupy
yeah actually here you wanna go is that
it was along this this seam in the back
and there's only there's only so much
you can do to repair a mineral oil tank
and that's that's the only vertical seam
yes and so we actually tried to repair
it Jake God you tried to repair it and
then it didn't work you all sinned and I
tried to repair it and I fixed it
we just didn't try to reuse it I filled
it up with water and let it sit for like
a week and it didn't leak at all well
the issue was not being filled with
water
yeah issue was when you moved it okay so
whenever you moved it around full I was
into it I felt pretty sure that it was
fine and I'm pretty sure that I repaired
it according to the instructions from
anyways the point is you wanted to know
how we got another change yes because
because for some history for those
people yeah puget at least I don't I
don't know the story or but PJ wasn't
making these anymore because of some
crazy lawsuit thing that happened a
while ago we talked about in winter yeah
so so I knew these is really hard so
someone crazy out there
owns a patent on like putting a gaming
system submerged into the tank and
threatened puget with a lawsuit if they
didn't stop selling them even though
puget didn't even sell full mineral oil
cooled machines anymore
all they were doing was like selling
this acrylic kit so that people could
assemble their own and like they weren't
making a ton of money on it or anything
they were just doing it because they
were more of a passion project and kind
of we've been doing this for a while so
we might as well keep doing this kind of
thing and like we're cool dudes cuz
reputed systems and like it's cool don't
worry about it
so anyway this dick basically made them
shut down the project so what happened
was that was right around the time that
I realized that the repairs on my tank
gonna work and it worked it was not able
to send me a new one and you could just
go and find any aquarium we've tried
that whenever else Oakland one the
sizing it's pretty specific pretty
specifically this was custom-built yeah
this whole aquarium has some people that
know from from my original one isn't
really a solution either because the
acrylic is really thin and it's going to
crack as well so you just be making a
time long yeah I love making time bombs
yeah there's like gallons of mineral oil
all over your desk it's like super duper
bad you just got F in the chat just
press f just yeah so that flex tape we
should have tried that just Flexsteel
they probably want to work we I don't
know if that was a thing in this no we
should it would Laurie very good so some
of the stuff that's in here is actually
still OG and I upgraded actually
somewhat and some of it is some of it
has changed so the power supply is still
the original one so the first time I
took it out the sticker just like fell
off yeah all the glues definitely done
completely came off the heatsink this is
the original I forget right right Cocco
gauge silver air thermal right Silver
Arrow yeah it's called a Silver Arrow I
think it's right yeah that's the
original Kingston predator ddr4 in there
like we did this build when ddr4 was
CPUs was hotness I think I put a 59 60 X
in there yeah it had a 59 60 I say it
original he got taken out and then I put
it with back in there which is like part
of the Poe and there's a new board to
write the RAM slots yeah I'm trying to
tell the story jeez
all right so the RAM is the same I've
trying to do the stuff that's the same
all right I got a belit actually held up
surprisingly well
check this out like they have a little
bit of flexibility it wasn't under quite
as long as mine was but you can you can
see they're already kind of more than
I've expected it yeah yeah that's okay
but there was a bit of a situation with
the motherboard so one of the RAM slots
had an issue where basically
like the plastic for the RAM slot just
fell away when I took this we want to
take the RAM demo yeah it's just like it
was so great I opened wrap pulled it
straight out and it's just like
dissolved oh okay so I got that board
working again with quad-channel memory
by just bending the pins back oh my
goodness and putting that was bent away
but I laid off in position just right so
I think it's actually sitting in a band
in the warehouse somewhere the original
board and the RAM I was using to test it
because once I got it working but there
were other issues with that board too
one of the capacitors like oh wow ah but
I think I said about John didn't there's
Bella yeah though that word works so I
put I put the cap from another board on
if anyone wants to buy that board and
the RAM that's in it you shouldn't yeah
so so that was a thing and then the
graphics card I ended up doing a video a
little while it's literally right there
grab it switch the overhead check this
out classified AF baby so I'm doing a
video a little while ago as just sort of
an experiment like yeah drone at the top
there we clean yeah let me have a like
here can you hold this for me it was
like done with a dremel yeah so when I
got the new GPU so anyway so just as
like a fun video I grabbed that off the
shelf I was like let's do I I have no
time so this quick video let's find out
if a mineral oil submerged graphics card
that's been dripped dry yeah it'll still
work and it like worked and then like
sparked oh my god and it was done it was
Oh much too much dust game or something
I don't know it's done so EVGA sent us
new components yeah for whatever reason
EVGA look a year and a half ago and
we're finally getting to sorry Jacob
the brand-new you know state-of-the-art
gtx 1070 that we got going on in here a
replacement x99 mhz ex board micro - i
think okay so they sent me a GPU I asked
hey can we get like a low profile one
because I don't want have to cut it
again you sent me like the biggest one
they have I was like yeah this isn't
going to work so this is a second one oh
that's gonna be nice about 1070 s gonna
generate a lot less thermal power yeah
that 780 did and like my computer when I
submerged it was the highest part
computer that I knew if that had been
submerged it was like kind of on the
line already and then this one was like
well I really like bubbled oh man was
that tasted great so hopefully we're
doing a little bit better in terms of
thermals this time okay so there's a few
things like a few housekeeping items
that we left in has our DBT
it has our GB now at RGB yeah okay like
I went to rebuild this for LTX and then
we never brought it right yeah okay
well we're going to we're gonna we're
gonna we're gonna write clean it first
like how the hell are we even gonna
clean this you like you just pour min
over all on it
yeah like generally kind of you pour a
little bit of mineral on it we have
something right away with a cloth
because stuff like Windex is not gonna
be super effective unless it's actually
properly fully dry if it is properly dry
it's not it's not it's not we need to
wipe some of it down you've read of your
mineral oil it again and then you just
wipe it off okay so should we be using
paper towel for this though probably not
definitely not
tissue paper towel might be fine okay
like it's not going to be perfect I've
given a lot of thought to like what
we're doing on the stream now how long
are we streaming if I don't know okay
how did you get the new tank oh oh so
what happened was they are got it from
Puget they are still not producing any
mm-hm
I thought they had to like get rid of
all the demo machine from their Lobby
remember that and rather than rebuild it
they were like you
it's a little cloudy sure it's not
perfect it's old sure whatever but it's
in time but here it is and so they
actually were like driving up to
Vancouver he dropped it on my house was
it John oh it was John yeah I wasn't
home but he left it outside knocked it
off on like dates doorstep that's
awesome yeah so so here it is so we have
to kind of cool that's like a piece of
history in itself right that's really
cool yeah so so that's that's what we're
doing today first one day mate I wonder
no no no not even close
yeah no I of this kit style though I
mean like this version I have no I don't
maybe this is the first thing all I know
is that it's it's tried tested better
day maybe that one I was gonna call it
tried tested and true but hasn't got all
the way so maybe we're gonna call it
battle-hardened again you guys should
legit try flex seal and just like the
clinton they made clear maybe your
plenti rate and it's supposed to
actually only save water but you know
okay so what are what are we doing why
are we doing well I think we need to
take it's the same insert so
realistically this should be pretty easy
so we're keeping the radiator should we
need housekeeping you guys want and then
just kind of clunking it we want to put
it in that mineral there's like crap in
there is this this is the original from
their system oh and they gave us the
extra you're pointing at something that
they gave us a bunch it's gonna be
pretty heavy actually yeah so this is
from the puget mineral oil system we
have some new stuff which we can maybe
use for cleaning I guess new stuff
that's the same as we've bought no no
but that's I mean it's on you yeah and
then we have probably use unused we have
another one of those is this new white
ones
is this not my one is brand new okay
then we have enough we definitely have
enough this is the old stuff lubricating
rock juice you probably can't see that
I'm not gonna tilt it any more of them
yeah that's old okay Caitie rock juice
so should we take we take this out we
have the
the rocks from our system in the castle
this is there okay
yeah that's it was the same rocks had
exactly the same room that can't be
right yeah okay here hold on that's what
god this is exactly what got dropped off
at my house a little bit of mineral oil
some rocks
you were like doing a test to me that's
literally what they gave that's funky so
I don't think we ever planned no we
definitely didn't plan that but we have
like the exact same pattern of rock oh
no it is slightly different ours is a
little darker yeah it's pretty cool that
has more purple ours has these like
these dark blue guys in here that they
really have yeah we could just mix them
like just mix them up together and
they'd be fine okay so am i kind of
getting the vision for a better for yeah
science
am I getting the vision right for
cleaning this we're we're basically just
taking it like kind of what putting it
there I was thinking just like pouring
mineral oil in a Rubbermaid probably you
basically are throwing away or willfully
shouldn't throw away their well but
you're like sacrificing mineral oil to
clean that's what I was thinking but
you're running the mineral through the
parts so yeah that's what we wanted to
sit submerged yeah like you're gonna
hold this here we're gonna pour mineral
oil on it okay get this alright so this
that are not supposed to get mineral oil
on them yeah the top bits right yeah
yeah yeah so you just hold it in here in
the little hand pour some on there get
some of that dust off I think you were
under estimating the difficulty of the
task that no but I already did this one
time like like a while ago there's not
that many parts that can't have mineral
oil on them yeah I mean likely the strip
and stuff yeah so you're gonna hold it
there like hereis I'm we're gonna pour
the strips is gonna get mineral oil on
intervention I mean should we just get
the compressor and like blast this off
it's not gonna work you can put the
thing in the Rubbermaid they'll get
Rashad it's gonna happen sounds terrible
for the street
oh okay maybe we should just attach that
because we need to replace these tubes
anyways hold it in place but does it
need to be in place okay so yeah these
tubes are pretty done I got some new
tubes and fittings I don't wanna waste
new fittings why are we doing not new
fittings I don't Karen nicer ones why
are we like these are I don't think this
is the right size tubing for this these
are already mineral oil that's hell no
they're not okay to go we're using new
fittings looked at like 10 minutes
looking did you yes so I'm using able to
find fix fittings so I will not be able
yes it find okay because you're not
gonna walk over there and check are you
sure your children both the higher
likeliness there is that oh absolutely
good okay this is a very unusual this is
a very unusual inner diameter yeah it's
like 76049 wall or something with the
kid oh no fine we can't really
disconnect this properly but that's
closer this closes we get out when the
fans are plugged in the controller it's
double-sided tape mordy okay okay why
don't we switch to the overhead so
people can actually see what the crap is
going on I need some more light instead
of focus
yeah a little bit I tried to fix that
but okay I'll try and fix it more so
should we dedicate it one person to
swapping these fittings out and getting
the new tubing did you recut the new TV
no we have a cutter I don't think that
fan takes that better
stood and given my eyes the decision on
this one I never looked at it in the
first place but I'm pretty okay
yeah it's like our job to stream this is
a science really have a camera person
yeah okay so should we just pour some
mineral oil on this thing or what
did we tell John to go oh gosh I'll do
that okay so or do you know what sighs
okay ting Rock juice for this yeah so
usually we'll stuff that huh
right should we just use this we have a
whole thing of the good stuff we should
use the lubricating rock but isn't that
already dirty leak well it's like Lester
the mineral oil it doesn't matter this
old okay yeah it's not gonna get worse
it's gonna lose its thermal properties
no I was just saying that you're less
effective as a horse laxative but I'm
saying like if you dump it the dirty on
to the dirty yeah it's not dirty
oh man oh that's pretty folding yeah I
know oh this is all the aji mineral oil
from the finished bill so how are we
gonna get that all and it's all settled
- like all the junk is at the bottom so
we could probably just bare it should
still be good though because if you're
running it through it doesn't really
matter yeah we're just hoping it picks
up more stuff and leaves yeah no it
should be it should be fine I think it
should be fine so should I just go get
like how much gunk even is there though
yeah I know it's worth doing yeah
there's like dust okay
even just one path to probably make
footage I just go get like a cup or
something or what oh gosh
yeah I guess so yeah and we should maybe
get some garbage bags for what we're
standing on plastic table stainless okay
it's all stainless all right all right
yeah all right yeah all right all right
okay I'm gonna go get some kind of
vessel Wow Wow
yikes so for the stream people did you
tell John I just did yeah so far the
stream line by the way we're also trying
to get this going
a flame this is mine it showed up while
I was gone this week not a flame thrower
but as you guys probably know it doesn't
come with the fuel so we don't have any
fuel for it so we're sending John over
to go get some fuel hopefully we can
light that up on the stream as well
makes no sense doesn't fit in with
minimal computer for whatever seems like
it might be fun I think it'll be fun
why is there a flamethrower in the
thumbnail there's your answer but the
timing of that was perfect a whole heck
yeah bud
why is slow mode on slim modes on
because this stream is like the the chat
is crazy enough
it's crazy with slow mode exactly so
like it off is gonna just when people
start the spammy it's at 60 seconds -
you can only send a message every 60
second and it's still crazy this is
gonna look terrible on camera but I just
need more light so dude probably
probably not by like absurd amount maybe
here though it hasn't been late in an
absurd amount of time for a long time
except for last week was like oh yeah
ten out of ten play twenty five minutes
how's that been yeah but not like 25
minutes from the sort of like 4:30 time
oh yeah but that wouldn't that wasn't
really firefighter time it is now sort
of but like I still AM for 4:30 every
week yeah oh man so there's that that's
the thing Home Depot will this work all
right
I couldn't really find the container so
I grabbed some M&amp;amp;Ms that someone sent us
for Christmas and I emptied all the M&amp;amp;Ms
into someone's mug and then I took the
container the M&amp;amp;M container let's find
it so oh this is gonna get oil like I
was about yeah I just had that
realization moment there so he's
probably go get some some cloths what is
what right gloves
who is I don't know guess whoever does
the point it's gonna get over the side
of the table and therefore that's not
gonna hopefully go really does this just
gonna make it pool in your hands oh we
don't know it climbs
oh yeah it's weird I might see a lot of
small gloves where the hell are they you
do - equals cool wow that's a nice spin
one of them say so my apologies we have
small and medium I have the large older
well yeah I don't think that we've yeah
neither those will fit me so so what
about large I need extra large Oh or
extra extra large one of the two it's
pretty this is even small on me go up
your armless anyways well - swears by a
small gloves okay legit
they won't it's not gonna work I'm gonna
try these are not great but a MasterCard
number you bought like 50 of boxes of
them yeah nice and cheap but like 10,000
gloves are they cheap enough that if you
wrecked like a whole bunch of them
they're still worth it oh yeah heck yeah
that's the way to gain my tub man who
cares wait they are disposable well yeah
that was sort of the idea perfect
alright so if I just you think it's
gonna just oh no like it'll take a while
but face its gonna claim to whatever you
have so I get to do some pouring I
suspect it might get on here it's like
fun because there's no key do I
good day what do you need what do you
want wide yeah let's go overhead
overhead boom alright
oh man here it is okay do you want me to
like so that's over head so I don't want
to drip all over like should I be
pouring down into the power supply
you're like yeah okay okay you do my
first my first entire supply first okay
here we go
oh it's getting very slippery that yeah
you might want to like toes under odd
situation if you start from this side I
don't and one two three go yep there you
go oh
the top that's fine that's what do we
have any cloths or anything ah prepared
for this like some like paper towel even
yeah there's paper time over there there
that's not a lot of paper towel Jake
okay you want to know what yeah you miss
a bunch of thoughts that just go ham
yeah not your hip Arnold Schwarzenegger
pouring pouring mineral oil yeah oh yeah
that's gonna be interesting
okay it's gonna be shiny that's for sure
yo man yeah it pooled in the shower plug
as well who is just pointing out there
this graphics card has not been
submerged yeah okay so we don't need to
clean the graphics card you speak when
you're doing one of these things I would
highly suggest for everyone watching
that you get some form I use like a big
big Rubbermaid container those bigger
the nice thing taken and I made like a
bath and I ran each part through the
back so I'll watch out you're dripping
outside of the bucket all right okay
so now we'll go what heat sink kids that
do you need more angle them that would
just start going here yeah just just try
to not only a little more everywhere
there's a little thing in there what are
you doing hmm there's an end of a depth
rep what do you do in there button
there's like snipped zap strap stuff I
might have just crumbled actually it
steams
okay okay really go for it what a hold
it more like horizontal or like okay
everything's fine okay

I just restore you I couldn't couldn't
ask for a better mineral oil PCE holder
I actually I probably could like
somebody that was like you could be
beyond reason we had had really good
endurance I guess Wow damn enough for
holding mineral oil feces I'll probably
clean them okay I'm gonna make a dog
posting for that it's like it's viscous
you know it's Looby yeah yeah mmm
there's so much gunk in there like you
know I'm as in Telugu this is tilt this
down to clean this yeah okay
oh man get ready for this it comes now I
think we need to do more they put all
the loot gates any more angle on the
dangle all right
yeah whatever think the chat is like
right now no idea it's like I never
thought I'd tune into three nerds
getting lubed up I mean I'm having a
good time sweetie group not - is it a
technology group okay we need a little
more on this side little more on the my
side of the hazy pouring water on that
motherboard yeah it's definitely water
you have so this is videos mineral oil
yeah yeah totally different from water
like actually don't drink it drink a
little bit stay tuned for the next
reason
hey if you just if it really won't come
out okay we good how we feeling about
this I don't know we should tilt it up a
little bit looks pretty all right
there's still definitely some stuff but
didn't complain me up there and want to
try to hit the i/o shield sure yeah I
can cover yeah I'm gonna tilt her up
okay
yeah that's like way better that helped
a lot yeah can you standing no I'm and
then like oh this a few times
hit it again somewhere pretty high okay
well it's just pouring right on the
table alright oh is it really yeah it's
gonna get the lads a little bit yes do
you say that's actually pretty good
that's pretty close to them yeah okay
it's definitely so some stuff but like
so you've got the lines chair should be
let it drip for a little bit it's not
gonna okay what about the mineral and
that thing do we want to take that out
yeah yeah it's pretty gross okay what
the hell the hell are we
I have another Rubbermaid spoke the
Rubbermaid drain this one somewhere okay
okay so we put this one in the other
Rubbermaid yeah okay good plan
yeah can you get the other driver made
in a new Niall kind of hot walking Jake
hot swap yeah wait where did the other
who put it under the table oh yeah
getting kicked by that Lynam TI guy was
kicking it mm using doe i actually
that's the first video I've watched in
like a while I thoroughly enjoyed them
very good okay ready
oh man and one two wait are you yeah
good idea
you wanna make myself better lay around
okay one two three
hippity-hoppity there we go and okay hey
that was pretty painless we did it okay
good job read it it's okay I'm gonna
move this okay and you want to put that
there yeah and I'm gonna pour this into
there is that good yeah that computes we
do not have enough light in here yeah
can they even see what we're doing
I don't know Brandon Tony it was enough
later so easily why didn't bring them
tell you this was enough light I don't
know I think it was enough light for
that one looking straight at us but the
overhead it's kind of not I brought a
little ladyboy in here thanks Jake
you you want to see the ladyboy yeah
that was gross
here's the ladyboy instead oh wow this
is cool
it's like cameras wide or the overhead
he's good he's good
oh that's crusty that is not good so
what we're witnessing here is someone
not sufficient job of washing their
rocks yeah yeah and this my friends is
why you always wash your rocks
I already watch these rocks a while ago
yeah these rocks are pretty you got a
you got a consistently walk through yeah
every time not even once not washing
your rocks these rocks look pretty
beautiful
keep your rocks water look at how rocks
in there Roxie's no this is like dead
that is the nastiest look it looks so
okay do you have like a throw away this
mineral oil container um no yeah we have
more five gallon buckets over there hold
on hold on hold on hold on so first why
don't we do a quick reference and we can
use will use our or Rukn yes yeah okay
so
Jake can you bring this down I'll grab
the orange bucket so this this stuff is
still like pretty clear this is dripping
everywhere because the rads got a little
bit oil on it and I think the outside of
the tub yeah the other time as well okay
just throw it for me to get another
Rubbermaid no no it's fine throw it
under the table that yeah okay I might
wanna okay Luke's doing it you don't
have gloves the loop you're still the
only one with clean-ish hands Gus Wow
okay he's free-balling well then that's
it it's all done the ship has sailed
now yep wait are the red still oh they
are still attached oh oh and there's oh
no oh no no no no oh my god okay all
right so here's the plan now we're gonna
do the same plan but with the the rock
bin same plan Rock bin so most one will
rinse our Cataline a different bin for
this no cuz I think we're probably gonna
throw away the stuff that we've used to
watch everything so we'll put that in
there
sure yeah okay do we need another five
gallon bucket I don't have a
three-finger deep I have a clean one
clean not cool yeah oh oh wow
so cold it's actually oh it's really
cool like this it's been seeing in the
warehouse this is a very cold just rinse
it in here no no so we made do we need
another Rubbermaid you like we need
another Rubbermaid no no we don't this
goes in here right okay okay we got our
little chippy boy is it how well these
help together yeah yeah it's brand-new
Rubbermaid like you never really know
actually uh ya know just these
decorations yeah like the paint it's all
held together oh speaking of which I can
switch to the wide in all seriousness
though this video is brought to you by
memory
yes we're gonna have them linked in the
video description you can check out know
max there's low stuff door Victoria is
that is that what that supreme yeah
they've got a new store in Victoria
basically if it runs on electronics
there's a pretty good chance you can get
it at MMX and in the event that you do
find a lower price they're overpriced be
guarantee means they'll be any
competitors price in store online by 10
percent of the difference
authorized Canadian authorized Canadian
retailers so go check them out we're
gonna have them linked in the video
description they are they are Express
calm max don't shake it like don't shake
it like that back overhead I don't think
there's much stuff in here oh I feel
some more plans yeah I think there was
two plants and councils a plan T and the
ship well maybe we don't put it all back
it doesn't matter what I think I'm oh
it's slippery one job boy that's why we
call them one job ty v yeah so how are
we gonna do this I'm just gonna hold it
off one job no no just hold the bucket
and put it on the edge same as long as
that link yeah yeah exactly
no I don't think this is going to work
well not with that attitude here just
take this yeah cuz this is totally
working right yeah another bucket
oh it's washing the rocks it's washing
them too much it's like washing them
away easy washing the rocks away sighs
those rocks that's not your job
one job just clean the rocks just clean
the wrong what's yeah that is I think
that was like a nozzle for the bubble
the bubble this
bubbly boy and that thing did not work
very well no it was a failed experiment
will it work fund in mind yeah it's just
ours flowed too freely and then it just
like there was one in the puget one two
yeah there's probably was smarter than
ours in some way because boy it's so
cold oh gosh a big private is none of
this stuff is really made for a mineral
computer so you never know how it's
actually react yeah almost literally
nothing is made and you can't really
return like efficiently perform in my
mineral oil cooled PC you know for my
own now it's covered in oil you want it
back for full refund please for my
mineral oil for a frog okay I'm feeling
pretty good about as clean as we've got
it now okay so I think the real tricky
trick here is Jake and I yeah okay yeah
I don't forgive me oh yes Luther hands
well we're going to low we're touching
it can you lift it up a bit I feel
closer to you than I ever have before
yeah I don't really like it you kind of
smell I'm getting pretty jealous right
now
although apparently I'm Riley's dad now
so check dad papa new develop papa Luke
how are we doing it's still younger than
him can you a full couch I might be oh
man someone on Twitter to say oh man
it's so cool because of his stache
did you see his stache well then oh it's
bad it's a bad scene looks great what
are you talking about that's great if
you're a p2 or tote which I think we're
good good I think we're clean we're full
I couldn't see the I think we're the
exit area rock clean okay I I don't
think I've ever massage rocks let's go
for plan plan yeah get bad oil in there
oh there's 20,000 people watching this
that is unbelievable Linus Lube tips
rose Wow there's three separate people
No
there's three separate people that said
Linus Lube tips in separate channel that
was really really disgusting like there
was more than one bug in there that's
like probably a very very old dead bug
like this was sitting in their Lobby for
a very long time
like I that was the shinobi you want to
clean this with some fresh material some
freshly I saved some old freshman also
here why don't we give it a pass with
the with the cleaner stuff here
oh that's map gas oh okay well get wait
wait okay we'll get okay good
yeah what's I don't know right now it's
a great time well so how flammable
mineral oil is I don't think so oh did
you bring the whole thing its map yes I
think right let me see yeah it's about
yes that's burns way hotter I don't know
if that's I mean there's only one way to
find out I guess how much was the thing
I mean I was resilient oh wait a whole
reason for buying it was I try to flip
it but then it showed up so late that I
don't know if it's gonna be worth it
some of the first ones that got
delivered people were flipping them for
Walt but yeah that did seem like kind of
an uncharacteristically this Tyler back
for you
okay I was wondering if he's here you
might know or maybe ask Alex I think it
was like 500 some of the first ones that
looked where were like 5 to 10 K holy
crap yeah I know this was a financial
investment that just got delivered way
too freaking late you could probably
still I still play it was like a Bitcoin
mining machine you didn't make your
money back I bet if not I think it'd
make a little bit cuz there were a
limited quantity right okay they were
all right so this is rinsed should we
wipe it I don't know if I did a great
job of the top load it's kind of hard
for me to get right up to the top what
if it what if you like hand sacrifice
yeah I can I can try no no like oh
actually if that works that doesn't work
pretty well six on your hand yeah yeah
yeah hey want some no moisturize your
beard you'll get nice and beardy okay
okay all right another poor thing very
quick and then we might do not get
inspection yeah oh man it's like it's so
dirty
yeah but it's significantly that's a lot
better like way cleaner okay
can we do one more pass or no with some
problem no I think it's probably okay
it's about as good as it's gonna be my
expectation is not that this is going to
be perfect just that it will be a lot
better than it wasn't okay so rocks then
do you want to switch this to the web Oh
God it's still got a clean wrist there's
only two buttons yeah I know that's
right I put them separated on purpose I
was like oh that's a good idea
okay so I'm gonna put this aside for now
I am so happy you didn't drop that all
these super chats about - Lube tips and
then this can go a time Narnia or
something yeah yeah else we're very far
away as far as possible
these rocks are nice and lubed oh yeah
lubricating rocks we're ready for this
okay
literally should we should we wipe this
down
we should wipe this down we should make
sure the feet don't have oil on
eventually because they're rubbery I
think yeah I think that ship sailed I
think we do that after all we can't do
that yeah we can get it off yeah that's
gonna be a problem let's do that so
should we put some cardboard down on
this table or something there's some
carbo right there still that backs it's
like still no it should be fine okay I
don't think that's gonna effectively
would be better than nothing we can do
better than sitting on a metal and I
thought you meant to like stop it up now
yeah that's that oh yeah yeah that UPS
box perfect none of the other stuff no
I'd say I have my knife fee boy here
oh I don't want mineral oil Oliver hello
just for the cardboard okay do you have
mineral oil on your hands yeah just go
for it I don't care you're asking me if
I had mineral oil on my hands I'm like
like you have I'm literally holding my
hands like this so that they do one hand
drips into the cup other hands yeah go
for it that flippy boy I don't know
about you guys but I'm having fun yeah
this is kid she was great I'm excited
for the flamethrower I've wanted to do
this for a long time me too
I think I've asked you probably at four
or five pen yeah I said it was a waste
of time yes but that's okay because
that's the thing about live streaming on
the Internet
Val H was a waste of time becomes
productive towards the team because
other people are watching it it is not a
waste of time or something are you in
Canada yes we were in Canada sure are
there bud
yeah there bud we you know got up in
there Derek Canada there bud yeah there
bud go out for a rip up there rip there
bud yeah I get out the stage vo go on
America's top hat here a button alright
looks freaking mint there bud break in
mint oh I found some more stuff out what
is this do you know if this is this is
not soaking up enough of it for me to
feel like what I'm doing what's this I
know that's you're just gonna push it
around but do you know these was just
massaging the rocks a piece of one of
the things like all the plant the plant
plant holder to hold the plant so that
means there's probably another one then
or maybe there's two the little ones
didn't have a bottom or they both went
into one maybe oh that is possible
somebody look up the video and tell us
and then you're gonna have to see you
port attic for the otherwise I'm knock
money yeah cool yeah it's something I
like you can say you can super town a
dollar I'll subscribe to floatplane oh
you're so sweet
what is that floatplane calm yep we need
to get LM GGG /fp
yeah yeah that's easy to remember yeah
it's kind of harder than do you guys
have a short year this is why we didn't
hire Jake for the little plane marketing
department yeah it's too bad also
floatplane doesn't have a money that's
the main reason we didn't hire Jake
really
oh I mean even if we had one we wouldn't
hire Jake Oh the main reason would still
be that there isn't one
yeah it's a big handprint well cute is
that coming off is it on you should do
for isopropyl alcohol over olive oil
there so I can't see it but oh no it is
on this side okay because hey yeah no
you're right yeah okay for those little
fingers still there that's okay that'll
come off three men three men Friday
afternoon covered in Lube this is all
facts yeah yeah yeah okay cool so this
is much cleaner now oh look like a lucky
email that's cute
oh really yeah that's pretty sick lucky
what lucky the dragon dragon Oh giant
stupid dragon faith is amazing whoa I'm
stupid
whoa well other people kiss aren't
stupid call it stupid
hey it's not stupid it's it's not stupid
it's coolster
you just was really cool you wouldn't
know cool if it was four feet high four
feet wide and looked like a dragon oh
yeah I thought it was a dinosaur no
dinosaurs are fake dragon is fake news
the fake news dragon okay we can clean
up later though so okay well I wanted to
make sure that it was
and lights good call this looks good now
it looks alright okay you can stay like
is the hair you grab that's hair hey hey
there the thing is there's like always
gonna be some of that stuff because
there's some stuff that's gonna fall in
well we're okay so should we we can we
can put in the rocks do we do this by
hand or just pouring them Oh
lower the plastic container and then tip
it over inside yeah yeah so you want to
do the honors I feel like we should let
Luke do this yeah no we shouldn't let
Luke do the middle oh yeah poor that's
the big he's now master boy yeah Looby
boy it's like Luke change one letter
lube no incidents I don't think so but
can your Luke do this thing you're like
Jake I just like waited a couple seconds
you know actually gets really old yeah
especially zeon Platinum's I also did it
more recently than that when they were
here late building David's computer and
like it wasn't posting or something and
I didn't feel like putting the heatsink
back on oh yeah
so that it wouldn't get honestly it's my
favorite ways to just freak people out
with I've done it more than I needed to
because like I want to kind of give her
stomp people you know tray like a few
don't know I just palm your CPU that's
fine trust me I have the force that's me
I'm a professional yeah not anymore or
yeah not anymore
dang actually that's not technically I'm
on shift right now just very different
something so I guess that's really bad I
should yeah myself up you said you
should contact you know the HR or CEO of
that company
I let them know what a problem is right
now especially because I bet you a few
of the people from Flo playing are very
I'll be watching where can i buy one of
the shirts that Jake and Linus are
wearing Oh actually we finally launched
the store what is it LT t store not see
I was gonna leave it actually oh it's a
red yeah it's right yeah there's a
little there's one pink one it's the
white probably gonna disappear okay do
that we store shelf yeah right l TT
store calm it finally has this circuit
board design in it there's some other
shirts as well it's got the it's got the
cable ties in it it's got those those
fake USB the scam thumb drives the
collector's item thumb drives I mean is
there really anything else to say about
it I don't know yeah oh you buy stuff
we totally revamped the way that we're
doing merch so the shipping rates kind
of suck because we're shipping
everything out of a warehouse not not
our warehouse but a warehouse that's
actually it's got the NCIX connection
do you remember Patrick come in CX yeah
oh that makes sense
Patrick okay so he's he has a logistics
company okay well it'll probably go fine
yeah
Patrick's Patrick's dope Patrick's
awesome yeah so it so anyway yeah
Patrick's running it with the Sun and
it's like that's his startup he's I'm so
glad that he got out of in sac so far
too competent yep what about the quality
and and yep so so the reason that we
sacrifice sort of shipping rates was
because we have dramatically improved
the quality literature overall got a
sales boy in there oh it's probably make
you so just better printing better
shirts they're significantly better I
test fit one of them and it was they're
just generally just we were really tired
of every merch partner eventually either
skimping on the quality of the printing
or the quality of the words yeah they
would start really nice everyone started
off so overtime just they try to save
money and cut corners yeah so we're just
tired of it so we're going with our own
stuff now and there's some sacrifices
like it's hard to have so many different
designs we have to actually pre buy like
we spent tens of thousands of dollars on
shirts yeah
by them preprint them we can't do
on-demand anymore in order to get the
better print quality that we wanted but
it's just do you think that thing is
worth it the bare domain transfers to
WWE yeah yeah okay so there that's it
we're we're rocked we're ready to rock
well we've posted like oh no what what I
described I was like what are you
talking about why didn't you talk about
that but it's just really hard to get
out which match your shirt or do you
stretch your legs I'm gonna rip entire
system Mike yeah people never do that
again so we need to do the test fit for
the computer so we know where to put the
ship and your castles gonna grab you
know I can grab it I can grab it or wait
no the handles are not enrolled there's
only one handle left well there's two oh
there's one wait for it wait for miss
bought it where is it is it not attached
anymore the handles yeah there's one
right here and there isn't one there oh
Jesus Nicky yeah I don't remember that
being under there should we just like
detach that know it to me such a pain
double sided tape it what double-sided
tape twice the fan controller that's
what the problem is you just undo the
fans from the fan control oh but they're
stuck in there okay oh so I get closer
to you closer to you yeah one slight
flutter is that yeah okay I'm gonna pick
it up this way yeah okay yeah I want to
switch to the overhead Jake yeah Jake
you my boy uh-huh yeah do you like jakey
is that a good know what we're not even
close not even any time okay I might get
Jake to pull the rads back that's before
I put it in right
nice company here we go all right
wiggity wiggity hey that's yeah it's
kind of in there there we go
when you get there back off these boys
down and huzzah we have a mineral it
mich PC we have my aquarium tee the
mineral oil comes later oh yeah okay I'm
just making videos with you okay so we
need to get the the fittings off and
swapped tubing cut yeah things placed in
positions they can go in and them and
oil in okay so where do you want to put
the stuff we've got your tanker a castle
thank you is that all all we got and so
it's yeah it's one set of place
I haven't down to do away with the
plants yes if it's uh if it's
inconvenient well it's in grades kill
the plants there we go I'm not so let me
just see if I can get this together
pretty easy then I bet they were glued
in there I bet you they were that's not
how betting works yeah oh boy we good to
know yeah I think that's a that's a
solid fixable but we take a look so good
so the cast is a little tall I think we
remember that it was close to them so I
think the tall spire had to go home the
sure okay I can take that so basically
it's got a go go kind of right yeah I
think that's exactly right I remember we
had some weird funky that's the ship
pile over here so I think so and it's
coming along like that yeah like that
casts a little something like that no
prob
no problem I bought a piece of cake is a
piece of crumb cake okay so you're doing
your fitting swap over here I'm doing my
fittings you're getting a wrench right
cuz like you're using mineral oil soaked
fingers to to find it like that it's
actually a terrible terrible idea Jake -
for real it's literally fine
if it leaks then you can be like I told
you so is that working
that's what this is obviously that's
what it's always about no it is not
yeah have you met you you know Jake I've
met Linus and while he will say the I've
told you so you would rather not I don't
think so I think I think a tiny bit of
leakage just for an i-told-you-so is
totally worth it he will be more proud
than less I told you so I've had so many
I told you some of those you could it's
already did a 100 you know there's
probably a slow leak mmm yeah the
pooling the pool of oil in the the power
plug is what we're talking about right
now for those of you watching at home
there's work Wow Wow plane people we are
restreaming this to flow plane as well
no oh why not well Jake what do you mean
Jake what I mean G Jake it's on you
yeah we streamed to floatplane every
time for darling okay how do I do that
well I will probably have to get you
guys a different stream key that can be
set for unless you want a stream to
twitch as well and then it's just the
same one I mean I can't really think of
any reason like not to just stream to
twitch whatever we're doing stuff I
might like forget to update the title
and stuff cuz which hasn't exactly been
a priority for that so we're not over
here lately is that propane is that the
right thing John that's that's right
propane propane and propane accessories
national pain so we can actually I think
we'll just finish this the lines drop
tense
okay know the greatest thing ever
actually was it was when when your son
dropped oh that was other way that I saw
your expression I knew what was coming
there's no way the editor is not putting
that in the video because there's such
trolls right when he dropped it I just I
saw like Linus looking into the future
so this is just gonna be more oily than
the original build yeah like there's no
oily drain on that the oil will sort of
yeah yeah yeah it'll pretty much always
innovate there there's stuff I don't
remember what it is but there's stuff
you can use to break down the oil not
isopropyl alcohol because that'll crack
your acrylic but like yeah I'll being
around this thing bad scene Homer what
is I'm sure someone some of our 22,000
viewers might know what it is it's a
breakdown it might be so neat that maybe
they don't know whatever it is someone
in our audience knows or thinks they
know yeah definitely love you guys like
comedy minutes under yeah that's okay
I've been I've been cleaning that's why
I'm like cleaning the top and I'm kind
of paying attention to the bottom side
so I wanted to lift it up then do a pass
of the bottom side as well
hexane I don't even know what that is oh
okay yeah sounds like a stay so what
propane is what they had I think they
had a question okay okay I can't get
these fittings up maybe is that so I'll
lift it up and you can put the stuff in
oh we're leaving I can't get them all oh
okay I could use a wrench but maybe we
just leave them sure yeah fine it's good
yeah heck yeah yeah okay
steps left yeah actually we're doing
pretty okay Jake did you bring that
keyboard and ice I remember that thing
monitor
I have monitor you have a monitor right
behind you okay so I gotta know
something um Luke do you mind switching
us to the the wide turn it so you know
that character in South Park that's he's
got like the red bangs we found always
goes like this you bet to deal with this
situation all this hair if you watch it
watch him he'll be like
if Jake's was off that was probably it
oh all right well we lost like six seven
hundred people because of audio problems
oh no oh no we're sorry everyone is it
are we good now
we're working on it Jake's getting new
batteries yeah I just wanted to hear the
monitor it sounds fine cool sorry dude
was it missing yeah oh that's bad Mike
disconnected audio those stupid
Sennheiser ones do that yeah I don't
know it's really dumb that's one of the
reasons that we started using those mic
check hey actually ordering more of
electro Sonics so that everyone can just
work to some extent yeah those are super
nice really that's the battery life how
much are they only like three grand
apiece four grand for for a matched pair
oh I thought I was over estimating you
weren't you weren't okay so Kim can can
we lift it up so that I can wipe down
the other side I wanted to finish
tightening names but sure I already did
it okay okay okay do you have that okay
yeah like how you doing there no no you
know what look I believe in you if you
uh if you have any guidance in terms of
where I should wipe um I think Jake's
getting the part that I was worried
about before we're doing a wipey I don't
think it's productive this back bit just
in front of the Reds without making the
Reds fall oh you know you're funny you
can only get a sound really into me hold
on I got it you guys sort of I still
believe it going I still believe in you
taking you out for a dinner first I
guess yeah oh dude it's really lovely we
got that do you still have it yep
because I would love now to do this I'm
just going to supervise to do this pump
thank you for fixing the audio you're
welcome
do you mind changing the angle Jake as
well the angle of the dangle oh wow yeah
this cable is super super hard not as
good it's long
it's hard it's hard and it's ready to go
flute it's full lubed a plus lubed ok I
think it's now pretty adequate lubed
yeah adequately lived total we didn't
really get that much in the graphics
card you know what I don't even think we
fill it all over it yeah I don't even
think we have to put the cable ties that
were in here back in because like the
cables they don't they don't move I
think I removed a bunch and I was like
wow this isn't moving ok cool so that's
back in place we are we are good we are
good to fill you want to put the things
in oh I still got it up here I sure do
give me one second yep where are we
playing but yeah so I'm lining this up
oh heck yeah but around there but not to
be confused with Air Bud and then you're
gonna help me got it in so we don't yeah
beer the thing ok uh yeah go ahead so I
can take so I can take some of the
weight here
I gotta launch this thing ok I'm also
concerned with the positioning ok make
sure you're watching yeah I'm good ok
looks like I'm rad conflict sorry yeah
are you good with the rather you need me
to help you I got I got it I got it I
got it
look if you want to fix the rats they're
good new they're good ok oh there's one
sorry this side make sure you hold very
good I am not thrilled with that Castle
position can I hold on oh no you're good
you good you good you good you got it
okay oh my god oh the boat the boat up
again yeah no no no that's good that's
good
what is that beeping I don't know but I
can't deal with the clearance though wow
it looks way not as good
that's good enough need to come forward
just leave it it's fine whatever snow
let's I mean I do not agree with
whatever are we good isn't it gonna move
when we put the oil in there too I don't
think it's good enough okay does it move
with the rads
how the rads are ready the only annoying
part yes they get in the way and then I
don't need long okay okay yeah got my
mark right there
good we're good we're good you're good
you get better that is that is what are
you doing no I I accidentally got hit by
the goalie others the PCIe crushed it in
I'm sorry Jake Jake yeah I just wanted
to see what it look like I'm sorry you
guys I suck so the capsule come forward
or no it's fine really I did Cassie yeah
it's got my mind almost immediately okay
so you gotta push it away forward yeah
and I gotta kind of fix the rocks and
everything I think it needs to go
forward more in the example that's no
but like just make it flat I guess sure
what if you turn it around the other way
so it's tilted over oh yeah
unclear turns 200 good
nailed it cool nailed it now that no no
that mission accomplished okay um Looby
tubes pump is connected Wow remember
when like coloured SATA cables are sort
of cool I don't think they were they
were cool they were cool not when you
built this maybe 10 years before you
built this maybe but they were very cool
for a little bit yeah because for a
little while there you wanted like just
as much color in your computers yeah
like all these cables are gonna be
rainbow anyway RGB and we also last
night
all right so uh newbie time is that it
do we fill it I think we should test it
first
Oh can you imagine it doesn't even work
yes we do that okay sure yeah let's
let's do that so I can deal of right
yeah did he glove for that skin on skin
love this even the poor we shouldn't
really get much oil on us yeah all right
shouldn't keywords shouldn't usually use
to be honest okay hey wow the gloves
work perfectly
your soundcard at all or are you lying
no it's no I'm good
actually mine leaked a little yeah yeah
be honest broken that was also really my
nervous moist II way to speak yeah we
didn't actually have to do that do we
need a power cable I guess like clean
some stuff
yeah power cable would be good what I
switch to the yeah heck yeah heck yeah
but really soapy water is actually
pretty good
really getting rid of the oil yeah warm
soapy water
oh did dig think to get Lauren and grab
a power bar alright I'll be right back
yeah you you entertain the people what's
up chat you guys are mine now and my
message is held review wow yeah that one
can't that can't go through i I don't
necessarily mind it but that cannot be
public beeping coming from the server
Warcraft to reference hell yeah
boner will be on the floor in no time no
I think I think I think it's fine we
won't we won't bump it unless Jake
supposed to take it out what's the
problem are you talking smack nope no
problem are you talking smack warning
about the moderates on the edge of the
Kennedy is here let me just do I see
this are you talking smack yeah I was
gonna say don't you
I liked it right before you hit you're
like oh are you talking smack
that's the the experienced smack down
right there hmm I could smash this into
the table into the table and ruin
everyone's ears again
we gained all those viewers back by the
way yeah okay Luke your mic is dying too
is it
Oh dying or dead not dead really these
Sennheiser do me last so long yeah this
one's battery's a little bit low is that
two or three or one of three it's two
though yeah you're gonna be good for
eight hours from now yeah okay this Yolo
that's gonna happen all right
ah so power so you got your own power
look at Sonny pour it
yeah I went and got one while you were
going to get the other power yeah double
power
oh that's Jake that's fine and
everything is fine everybody watch the
thing okay board you like hooked the
power button up right Jake looks like
it's it shouldn't have been unhooked
it's a new motherboard I think I did it
might appeal there's so many plugged in
so I imagine it's that okay three two
one two hey
Green's oh no RGB boy I thought it was
not Christmas Eve
buoyant full door could you set the
display up put on there is that pump
just running dry
Kirk off quick did it looked like it was
about to turn on so maybe I mean it's
probably pretty Lube dad yeah I think
it's fine it's probably fine yeah okay
so jet for those of you whose
motherboard has linked for those of you
who don't know something pump shouldn't
be run dry because their actual label
these ones anyway are lubricated by the
water flowing through them this one's
got a lot of that this one is probably
gonna last long enough for us to at
least make sure this that's a weird
byproduct of mineral oil is if you have
fans in the mineral like the fan on the
power supply it will last like forever
because it cuz it's just super early
unless it has like an electrical failure
but yeah it'll spin a lot slower deep
these fans are just voltage controlled
the GPU just spun down the fans I'm
imagining it's working yeah yeah it was
sent to hdmi and displayport it's not
always good about picking up after the
fact yeah yeah I still would really like
to see ya post should we
oh that's which is a desert Isis do you
know I took it off no we took it off
yeah but it should still supposed to go
okay cute I'm a little uncomfortable
that it hasn't posted so far yeah yeah
yeah you magic if there's no CPU in
there you didn't pull the CPU did you
don't know I don't think so
are you sure cuz I know I'm not sure I
just don't think so okay close quote 29
for EVGA is it still showing that even
the GPU fan spun 30 give it a bit okay
it's still at 30 can you imagine I think
it would do might not even turn on
still 30 Oh Jake did you test it I did
when I did the swap yeah it worked fine
I even put a fan on the perimeter but it
was back to 30 for a second I was 31
I'll just let's give it a second it's
had a long slumber maybe we need to
replace the CMOS battery or something
yeah I've seen boards that have not
posed as a mess I've really wished that
pump wasn't plugged in try clearing your
CMOS check the CPU for bent pins ASL is
reserved for ESL status code so it
doesn't have a dresser definition yet
it's just like counting up wait 32 says
CPU wait what mother party magpie
strokes oh come on
don't stand up too quickly hate the lamp
is right above your head 32 says CPU
post memory initialization is started
try resetting the CMOS we should try
that that's like
troubleshooting step one zero our button
is but wait turn off nobody has to have
power not on but I actually don't think
it does have to happen I think it's like
this is how you do it without it on okay
but it needs to turn off all right
hello you gotta hold it down for five
seconds yeah kids to name just anything
computers were to reach that you're not
I can feel it click in just okay alright
let it try and beat them you suck
nerd
okay we're getting more normal-looking
postcodes now so that's a good sign I
would still kind of expect something to
show up but it still like something to
show up pretty darn like quick fast here
imagine if that was like a temperature
display not a postcode display 70-79
okay well problem closed 90b - give her
a sec come on baby sometimes like d7
come on baby
okay well it looks like that like the
GPU initialize give her a little
worthier but and normally the GPU
doesn't post until after the cpu and ram
right so maybe it's one of those boards
that doesn't boot without storage no
there's no way are we still on d7 g7 no
console input devices are found the
keyboard is this a key border they might
be one of those mothers generally show
yeah it should be outputting yeah like
try just from different display port
port let's just try HDMI good old HDMI
you know as time goes on I like HDMI
more and more well it's just by contrast
to display for it yeah
DVI was still the king what the hell
Jake what the other end of this DP cable
wasn't actually plugged into here long
enough hooked it into this so that's
normally your chopping wasn't it was
just hanging HDMI for entirely your
fault okay I just want it over just plug
it when you bring stuff over in the HDMI
HDMI is no you can't even do this this
is all your fault
you're like yeah I thought of everything
got the chyron come on about the monitor
got the you know I'm you're just salty
you didn't plug in the other side no I
are your fault that is not what's
happening right now alright mom and dad
let's just get back to it son go back to
your room
who's a dolt talk chats freaking out cat
loves it maybe that's it tons of views
no keep fighting keep going we got
22,000 people now bicker go go go
she's not your real mom you're adopted I
don't know just this doesn't offend me
your adopted a to nobody that's like so
I did actually set this to DisplayPort
as well that is another thing that
definitely I see you DisplayPort cable
it's not plugged in is it still plug is
that a different way wait I think it
just ripped the menu away from me was
that to display something nope Hey what
does bleep our cable is that that's
nothing okay well that's that's posted
laughs for me yep time clean good oil
clean good oil
Wow you literally just said the same
thing got clean clean coal beautiful oil
beautiful clean oil beautiful beautiful
beautiful oil okay so how do we want to
pour this are we just gonna go shake
your fire holding your high out I
generally go that way unless you have a
better like hole but if I marry quickly
we did power sploit last time because
there wasn't one there's one right here
but getting to that is a bad take sucks
Wow okay do we have did you bring a
funnel Jake do I have to check and make
sure it's beside I didn't bring up my
didn't bring a funnel but do we need a
funnel I think the funnel would probably
be prudent prudent we're gonna wreck the
funnel whose phone is this
oh oh that's right now do be yeah are we
gonna go record one funnel uh yeah we
should just wreck our one funnel because
I think but doesn't matter what that's a
poor especially well you go get the
funnel and oh no but I want to be here
for that yeah exactly
Oh so run fast go get the funnel yeah
and then Luke can do his unboxing you
don't want to do the unboxing still the
Thunder no no I mean this is you this is
your jam man this is your deal all I
care about is that we don't destroy it
cuz I still can't tell you what tell you
what tell you what you know what we
should do is we should both sign it on
the stream okay and then you should just
list it on eBay
as the one that's signed and then and
then I'm five let people buy it probably
yeah not this so this is the not a
flamethrower from the boring company
yeah it's kind of like big and
realistically you guys have seen this
unboxing before so well dear not so
boring customer the lawyers have spoken
and due to shipping restrictions we
can't mail your glorious propane fuel to
make it up for you we've included this
$10 bill yeah okay so you can scroll
down to your local store and get one of
these fourteen point one ounce yep
that's exactly what we were looking for
which is about 11 inches high and three
inches wide and they couldn't convert to
non freedom units for us so there's like
there's a thing this is how you use it
and stuff which we should maybe actually
reread because because of fire and stuff
what's in the box that sounds boring
nozzle a boring logo ignition switch
propane tank fuel bracket idle not
regulator trigger shoulder rest wait did
you say propane tank ergonomic calm
placement oh no that's not what's in the
box
no no way we got yeah but it's it's not
it yes it's not in there cus Canada
probably
oh no it's everywhere okay Chevy Nova
states either I think just shipping
something that could explode they just
didn't want to deal with the legal shirt
potential problem sure sure bud oh man
that's pretty cool oh man it would be
great if you guys could see if the
string could what we see right now you'd
love it you just you would love it so
what they actually did is not that
complicated
and there's been tons people online that
have figured out even the exact airsoft
rifle rifle that they salvaged and the
exact torch that they put on the Fenian
or out of it so if you want to make your
own which would be a lot more economical
than buying this one which you could
also buy so I probably shouldn't be
saying this but whatever you can just
look up online what airsoft gun this is
yeah take the insides out put the torch
in that you can also find online and
then just there you go you've made your
own so whatever I guess mine is unit
number 700 exactly there you go did they
only do a thousand I don't remember I
think it's like one or two thousand
okay so yeah if trigger discipline there
we go baby okay heck yeah it feels like
an airsoft gun peepee you pretty much
which makes sense because it says it's
an airsoft gun yeah pretty much
so then I guess we just mount propane on
top plug that bad boy and I think we're
kind of cold in here now so this is good
that we have this yeah that's that's
what we're doing with this heating the
room
oh I doesn't like it you want to plug in
it that's kind of an janky mount wait oh
no you got to do that yeah I mean we
could have recovered at the instructor
read the instructions or watch someone
else's video or like really any number
of things but what we didn't is that is
the thing hot it's off its off its off I
made sure it's gonna make a wait
for it just tight okay she's tight she's
tight she's in she's tight
she's a point like a toy gun Mountain
hoping that's a satisfying click right
there yeah okay so um we're doing this
I'm gonna go over here now please don't
burn the lounge but yeah this is the new
employee letters by the way if it
started with the red thing yeah there's
a red thing on the front maybe this part
we should actually read you have to
start the pilot light organically you
probably just you just press it are we
just spraying propane okay don't point
at the wall yeah it should be fine you
probably have to press the trigger a
little I don't know man you do pilot
first okay you know what oh man that's
just the propane you're going to give it
I give it yeah
nice blah blah idle valve blah oh idle
valve this is the idle valve you
probably have to open that a little nice
okay so unboxing adjusting the reg blah
blah blah
adjusting the idle flame this is the not
a flame thrower comes with the idle
valve pre opened a quarter turn it on a
flame thrower idle is that a different
position turn the idle clockwise till it
stops then turn it to a quarter turn
okay so yeah I think you should be able
to start the idle maybe trying thing I
did a couple more times sure the tank is
friendly repeatedly point out him
opening the regs yeah yeah you just go
ahead and start it
yeah how about don't pull that still
here I don't know no cuz the idlers not
open properly okay so why don't we open
the idler a little here yes so it's not
yeah just hold on just try to hear it
okay tight so they did not ship ours a
quarter open okay cuz there's so there's
your problem
so open it a little bit oh my god
alright let me just get that dialed in
for you I'm just I'm getting I'm getting
out of here okay maybe don't point it so
far up all right go for it it's so hot
that's actually really yeah I wonder why
you shut I just like oh my gosh oh man
I got a little excited no one yeah oh it
somebody hears that it's not a
flamethrower flamethrower oh my gosh
alright let's walk away if you pull the
trigger you want to pull it like pull it
like a a 10 on the boil
okay whoa just a little bit pull it just
a little bit
ever heard of just a little bit that's a
thing and a half yeah alright that was
fun
why don't we fill the why don't we fill
the mineral oil PC smells like propane
in here so number 700 you'll know who's
that one was yeah oh boy that's sad I
hate there's 25,000 watching that's
warmer you know good so I don't know
yeah that's the that's the brand of the
earth so we wanted did you close this
star XR SCSI like they didn't even take
the original logos a purpose of this
exercise exactly it was cool was it just
a publicity stunt it was to raise money
for they made a bunch of oh okay
did you think about the cost of like a
really low end airsoft gun roofing
torture right yeah okay all right all
right
as gnarly alright okay I don't know like
the end is still super hot so I don't
really know what - like - I guess that's
a little warm yeah just whatever you
leaned it against its gonna be oh can we
just take this and put it if we put it
on the wall in here okay guys Oh shall
we LMG will buy it from you right Linus
I think that what's that now if I was
gonna buy one of those things I bought
one of those things I think I don't want
that in my house he's going yeah I got
kid oh I want it here we can put it on
the wall oh here yeah for the lounge oh
yeah oh yeah
you know let me get back to you on that
one did you get the funnel I did did you
ever even get the fire got the funnel
where is it I put it somewhere in here
right here
dang it Jake okay you ready a little
fitting on that up a lot of people doing
that so that seemed to work pretty well
that's what pretty funny I don't think
there's one threaded yeah there's Noth
right no no no it just that's just from
okay so what do you think of instead of
going through the power supply like this
taking that tubing and forget the
fittings just squishing squished is
again again pretty squished we don't
have to take the fitting off yeah I
guess we don't have to take the fitting
off okay so which here should we move
this over a bit I mean we could should
we just Park let's just pour into the
power supply it will likely get longer
yeah yeah we should just pour it
directly in all right so which to which
oil should we use like with ste stuff
the ste step big one or the small one
because that's the only stuff that we
know is is good this this is fresh yeah
that's what I'm saying oh is this s what
test
that's the SE is it it's just the
company it's white mineral oh it's not s
tu it's on the other side okay sorry god
I didn't know it says a bunch of other
stuff it says white mineral oil crystal
plus oh great okay well that was just
particularly so this is the crystal plus
them okay I cannot open this I'm gonna
try real hard I think we're gonna need
your sorry about the sound of the drill
thing yeah
thing we can do about that right now
wait isn't this you take this out and
the needful that thing though do we need
to cut this so crowded that ten snips
yeah this is like a grab the tin snips
that is not fairly obnoxious sound when
they said and he was gonna be drilling
something I thought maybe it wouldn't be
something quite so that like concrete
that's okay
pull sprout pull up yeah the audio is
bad they might as well at least be able
to see what we're doing yeah we're very
sorry guys it's they're like drilling
concrete over there and coming out or no
arrow so it looks like you should twist
wait hold up hold up hold up hold up I
think we need to pull it out and then
twist it I don't think so or you that's
just how it is it doesn't actually come
out oh that's just a rope in there a
separate thing way less than a minute
guys less than a minute we're good we're
good
we have this one appears a lot disappear
when audio issues yeah I know right
oh is it throw 500 people go on yeah
sorry less than a minute less than a
minute you guys I think we're good yeah
no I was cleaning out the outside so
like the only wait so we have to
permanently open this yeah I think so I
think that's like how do we need the
entire fiver for it I don't think where
are we gonna get can we move this after
is that a thing that's what the that
computer yeah it should be fine yeah
it's just heavy okay okay is he done
well yeah yeah go for it go play
you know it does still have this cap but
it's oh yeah yeah so you twist that on
top yeah yeah right perfect
fresh fresh okay
are you gonna be in the poorer I can be
I don't write it so I'm good either way
so are we going to the power spire we're
gonna have to go real slow yeah
it's gonna take forever that's not
should we just fill some of it and then
put it in a week and this like oh yeah
okay I think we might just want to like
Yolo this Oh what do you mean like let's
just Yolo like just try and get it in
the right spot well yeah yeah yeah give
me four this is gonna get this edge like
on here yeah and there's some heavy is
this pretty heavy it's pretty yeah okay
so wait do you want a lift and I'll
stabilize weird you want me to lift and
you stabilize Oh carry the weight and
you can direct okay Oh dick you stand
there and look pretty okay that's gonna
be heard you said it not me
okay hold on let me just get my light
that was the joke you get my light over
here
oh you're okay don't you love that when
you use self-deprecating humor and other
people are like oh ho cellphone like you
didn't know ready um oh yeah let's do it
oh and we're gonna go fast yeah yeah
here we go one two and that whoa there
we go to the power supply overfill or
something doesn't pour properly happened
wait Jake can you hop up something you
can wheel over it you can lower it a
little bit Oh God yeah lower it a little
bit just make it okay there you go well
we're gonna drip we're gonna drip off
the tinted a stripping off the chin
right now yeah can you go forward a
little bit not really
splash what if I go higher and we let it
like fall in I think will be glugging a
look at our fancy waiter port can you
could be more of a splash guard like
actually be in the way thank you
it's not really doing anything but sure
it no no it is it is it's helping it's
all like trust me
how are you doing for wheat there I'm
good okay we're at about thirty percent
we can back off a little now I can't see
the poor anymore oh I can I can keep
this exactly where it is if you want to
check it out uh yeah no we're good just
Inc was Jake was in my way okay okay
about 45 percent this thing's actually
like pretty open the second hole yeah I
would make too much sense we also
wouldn't be able to seal it again so
okay oh this is way more manageable now
wow it's almost empty
okay yeah it's like you not waiting
anymore
okay we're definitely gonna need this
whole thing not even gonna be enough no
we have the other thing I wanna switch
to the white anglo Jake there's like no
wait yes think wow wow just wow the
whole thing I think you've got it
because there's no way portal one nice
thing is once you get close to the top
there's more mass yeah I'm cuter Freddie
don't eat that much more we might be
good with the rest of our crystal well
the CPU is covered up and the pumps in
there heck yeah
how high do you normally go is there a
fill level on here ah this would be kind
of cool cuz this is good the GPU fan is
partially out that would be super sick
of it was just flinging it's actually
like really bad yeah really it's a bad
scene yeah so it flings yeah throwing
more oh yeah yeah let's do another
gallon here do we want it how hard how
high does so much more chill yeah
this was definitely a better way to do
the poor than what we did last time
though because it didn't shift the rocks
around what did we do last night we
poured it into the rocks and just tried
to pour really slow so it wouldn't we're
almost to the top of the graphics card
yeah you know I feel like it yes it did
have a fill line
what has their fill line trying to
remember was it on the outside door was
it on the inside because if it was on
the inside thing then it I think
we're pretty much out there for lunch
which is why it's kind of going oh yeah
that's possible they had a different
system like there's no other tool we
need to go a little bit more the
graphics card pen could use like a
couple of millimeters more okay yeah I
see it probably a little more I would
just go for it loop the full sentence
only cringe hey wow we had just enough
all right gosh dang you know it actually
looks isn't that a mineral good as it
did oh that feet sink has been through
Holly oh yeah
like that was a heat sink that we were
like was like kind of beat up and we
were sacrificing it to the mineral oil
anyway and then it kept going through
health yeah it lived it hell for a long
time it wrote us postcards it's like the
Diablo PR team Wow too real
our spine an eco mode not bad
yeah you've never seen this in person
have you yeah so I'd like the new of the
new writers who aren't like new anymore
they've worked here for two years have
never seen the mineral oil PC real put
together I have when it was leaking on
your desk
yeah and then it sat beside my desk for
like a year and then I took it apart and
they sat on my shelf and inside of your
shelf here here yeah well it's been a
dream a hot minute I'm kind of tempted
to switch back to it for the daily drive
I'm tempted attempt we should turn it on
and see how the fans interact and stuff
yeah keep the light in the oil and it
still works yeah any kind of
inconvenient I mean when show only
starts in an hour
we can always pull it classic and just
call Yugi out of nowhere hope that they
help us hey can we get another
motherboard hey remember the one you
sent us I don't know I was harkening
back to my my the only time I've called
a customer support line for a hardware
company oh that's right when they hooked
you up even though you've enrolled it
yeah oh that's so safe wait one of the
GPU fans isn't spinning really that's
why I figured it out okay just needed to
figure out how much to get it going
the pump's working so that's good that
didn't die this is so sick that's a
positive the end it's working
huzzah huzzah wait do we plug in the
SATA cable no there's no assist you on
the other side oh god yes oh oh that was
horrifying wait x99 no it's outside yeah
oh it is no it isn't it does have an MB
these well we should have real
that would be a significant improvement
to a mineral system because you wouldn't
need this or this well well though you
still need that way right the fans fans
why aren't the fans spinning
it's about receiving power this is a
different blue let's offense pick up
speed
