taking these phones down 60 feet in sold
water to find out which one survived -
how deep if any of them come along for
the ride
we're going to go down sixty feet but of
course the initial test has to happen
here on the surface are we lying or do
these bones even work
iPhone boom working G fine boom that
one's working too Moto X oh yeah baby
that one's working z5 premium it's got a
4k screens if that 4k screen survives
galaxy s7 look at that AMOLED screen in
LA in the direct sunlight
not too shabby eh and finally the guy is
Sarah whatever the crap this thing is we
only like this one because it actually
has a swimming Android robot as its boot
screen this one really thinks it's tough
we're gonna find out if it really is
so our first test at 10 feet or about 3
meters yielded some results that if we
had an ounce of gray matter in our heads
wouldn't surprise us much the LG g5
which advertises no water resistance at
all was dead immediately but also some
results that did surprise me I really
thought the Sony z5 premium would last
at least for a little while but it was
dead already
at 10 feet this made me feel very
uncertain about whether any of the
phones would still be alive and the Moto
X plays water repellant coating did
nothing to calm my fears it was
completely dead oh for 3 so far and the
iPhone 6s was no different one press of
the lock button confirmed that I was
down at least four of my six phones
right out of the gate but the galaxy s7
came through for me look at that it's
ingress protection or IP rating of 6
feet which you can learn more about here
by the way has kept it alive at 10 feet
under the salt water ban but what about
the Kyocera dura force yes we have
another winner it is officially a
two-horse race time to pack them up and
go deeper so at 20 feet we continue our
story or rather some of us do the
Kyocera dura force breathed its last
somewhere between 10 and 20 feet under
the surface of the ocean but what of the
galaxy s7 oh yes so it's rated at 30
minutes to a depth of 1.5 meters or
about 5 feet in fresh water but it has
actually managed four times that depth
so far in salt water but how low can it
go our next stop is 30 feet down and it
works unmade ok hold on a second so this
was actually a little confusing for me
at the time because I wasn't looking at
it when the screen spazzed out but there
you have it while the galaxy s7 might
not have made it to the award ceremony
it does come out the big winner in our
seawater waterproofness test now just to
ensure the accuracy of our results and
that none of the other phones had sprung
back to life I gave each of them a quick
double check under the water before
continuing the rest of the dive they all
conked out by 30 feet with the galaxy s7
actually holding up the best what we're
gonna do is we're gonna get these into
fresh water and then alcohol and then
we're actually going to attempt
recovering them but for now thank you
guys for tuning in to our ocean camp
test sponsored by phantom glass they
make great screen projectors but even
phantom glass couldn't have protected
these phones from the depths of the
ocean I mean look at this this one this
one's like got the back coming off here
