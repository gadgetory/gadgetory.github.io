now y'all complained about my laboratory
coat that I'm done more before but I
have decided to completely change things
up if you don't want to see the lab coat
in these videos about graphics card
showdowns then you don't have to anymore
so let's get ready to have a
head-to-head showdown between the Green
Team and the red team in Far Cry 3 Blood
Dragon so 100 bucks 200 bucks 300 bucks
and 400 bucks are the price points that
we'll be looking at to tell you what
gives you the best performance in Far
Cry 3 Blood Dragon now we're done loaded
up our this here test bench with that
there 39 60 X at 4 gigahertz we've also
got 16 gigs of ddr3 RAM the p9 X 79
deluxe as well as a 120 gig boot SSD a
thousand watt antec power supply and
this is our test bench we use for all
graphics cards we've also got of course
our H 100 keeping that overclocked CPU
cool throughout our testing the graphics
cards as you might well imagine do vary
somewhat now for our benchmarks we use
an in-game run only no pre-canned
benchmarks no pre fabricated numbers
nothing like that so you can definitely
click here to check out slicks a
benchmarking guide tutorial for far cry
3 Blood Dragon and what we've got here
is as you can see 8 graphics cards well
7 plus 1 is 8 so we've got the 650
versus the 7770 the 660 versus the 7870
the 660ti versus the 7970 and the 670
versus the 7970 which is actually over
there now the reason we've gone with
that is we take the second lowest price
card at NCI XCOM and that is where we
get our price reference from if in your
region the pricing is different then
you'll have to take the results with a
grain of salt
we overclocked every card and you can
check out the overclocked video card
settings that we use in our videos in
the graph that is actually in the video
description and I think the only thing
left now
to find out whether these graphics cards
perform or whether we're gonna have to
get the performance out of these
graphics cards we usually end up going a
little over a hundred dollars so the
7770 is around 125 and the GTX 650 is
around 120 however in spite of the only
5% price difference between these two
cards the 7770 l performs the other card
by almost 30% making it definitely the
the better option for far cry 3 Blood
Dragon the reason we go over on the to
it on the $100 price point is because
you really shouldn't be buying a card of
a lower tier than about a seventy seven
seventy if you want to get good value
for your dollar next up we've got the
660 versus the seventy eight seventy and
this one we had a price difference of
only about two percent whereas the
performance difference was about twenty
percent going with the seventy eight
seventy versus the six sixty not to
mention that if you bought a seventy
eight seventy a little while ago that
you will be getting a copy of Far Cry 3
Blood Dragon for free in the mail anyway
if you got the Far Cry 3 never settle
bundle any never settle bundle excuse me
the 79 50 and the gtx 660ti are actually
very close the 7950 wasn't priced as
aggressively as it usually is when we do
these comparisons but we always take
current pricing because we never know
what's affecting pricing trends in the
market so the price difference was about
10% and the performance difference was
about 10% so these cards stacked up
pretty much exactly the same from a
price to performance ratio standpoint
670 versus 7970 now the 670 really
didn't scale beyond the 660ti for us
which would indicate that there wasn't
much benefit to the additional memory
bandwidth as well as the other benefits
that make the 670 faster so there you go
it was bottlenecks somewhere else along
the line but the 7970 improves
performance a little bit over the 7950
and is able to achieve about a 17
percent performance difference between
its and the GTX 670 in spite of the only
six percent difference in price so that
pretty much wraps it up thank you for
checking out our Far Cry 3 blood dragon
perform
showdown with these graphics cards oh I
should mention the driver revisions we
were using so we've foreign video we
were using three one four point two two
and four AMD we were using thirteen
point four drivers don't forget to
