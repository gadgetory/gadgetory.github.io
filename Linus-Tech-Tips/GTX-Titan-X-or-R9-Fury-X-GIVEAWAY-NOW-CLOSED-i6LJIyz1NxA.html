giveaway it's the kind where you get to
choose the prize and all you have to do
is subscribe to my channel and leave a
comment under this video
and one lucky winner will take home a
wicked prize but wait don't leave your
comment until I tell you what to write
it's simple right which prize video card
you want a gtx titan x from PNY or a
Radeon r9 fury X we will then install it
in a custom-built gaming rig courtesy of
Super Micro you know the guys who build
like beast server gear including
motherboards and chassis and it features
a water-cooled core i7 59 60 x8 core
processor 32 gigs of clev Krass ddr4
memory that is some sick looking stuff
right there and whoa is that a 400 gig
intel 750 series PCI Express SSD for the
operating system with this is kind of
hilarious
I'm 960 gig P&amp;amp;Y SATA 3 SSD for secondary
storage apparently that's the kind of
world we live in and of course Super
Micro chose their brand-new C 7 X 99 OCE
motherboard featuring a sleek matte
black and blue color scheme overclocking
support and their renowned server and
workstation grade build quality along
with a super micro gaming s5 case that
boasts a solid and compact design
magnetic fan filters removable drive
cages so she can suck plenty of air
through the aluminum accented front
bezel and IMO just the right amount of
you know red accent bling so you know
there's lots of horses under the hood so
that's all you got to do ask yourself do
I want a gtx titan x in my new gaming
rig or do i want an r9 fury x in my new
gaming rig then make sure you're
