wondering can my hi again oh oh wow I
meant uh hey at the height of the chair
look at a wedge show how's it going we
have a bunch of great news this week
Twitter made money that's weird
I don't think that's ever happened
before no no I don't believe it has the
home pod steams your furniture
permanently AMD is apparently
potentially sending out free processors
we'll have to get to that later
well Google removes the ability to view
images now requires you to save them to
your account and um I think we've called
that enough news stay tuned to watch the
rest into a roll
I am so hungry like I need that sappy
Turkey today
yeah that's my solution
yeah
but that's having turkey PS the Sorachi
you know what whatever screw Colton and
it is really good yeah that's fine but
it's not okay when everything on a
ten-point scale starts at nine you still
you know yeah but there's tens but
there's tens Colton see Colton he's not
at you know he's not a ten thinker you
know he's more of a more of a nine thing
as long as you passed the post yeah
alright so we have got a lot of great
news for you guys why don't we get right
off with Twitter made money so this
might not sound too crazy but if you've
been following Twitter at all they have
never been profitable Twitter turns a
profit for the first time in 12 years
and just like so many others look at
this like look at it they've lost as
much as five hundred million dollars in
a single quarter oh man
like what do they do I'm like regularly
a hundred to two hundred million they
made a hundred million dollars like they
are clearly still many many years in the
hole but like 91 million dollars profit
on seven hundred and thirty two million
revenue and there's so many social kind
of tech companies like this that just
make nothing and burn for so long I
don't know like snapchat is actually at
the point now where it's like old and
people don't really want to use it
anymore cuz it like feels old Wow and I
don't
I still don't think they're really
making money so like yeah they didn't
really make enough it's it says here the
profit was modest 91 million on a seven
hundred and thirty two million in
revenues so the profit was 91 million
yeah revenue was 732 their shares soared
as much as thirty percent which is the
most since November 7th 2013
did they really go public that long ago
it's been a while
what see this is what this is why I
don't invest in stocks because I don't
understand it it's it's it's basically
if you're okay now to be clear there are
situations where I kind of look at it
and go okay how that sort of makes sense
like there are companies that pay out a
dividend on their profits to their
shareholders so if you do the math and
you go okay well this is blue chip
enough and stable enough that I think
that they are a blue chip terminology
blue chip yeah blue chip stock is like a
predictable one that basically rises and
falls as the market in general does I
think you're bad at stock I'm like a
tier below okay so so if you look at an
you go okay
this blue chip stock pays out dividends
that sort of X rayed and overall we're
tracking this and the account economic
outlook is why and whatever can't buy
any right then you could kind of go and
and in in eight years I'll have made
back what I spent on my stock in just
dividends so like if there's some kind
of math that you can do where you kind
of go okay yeah sure maybe that sort of
makes sense to be clear it's still
gambling cuz it can all still yeah
totally be destroying a company could
vanish yeah but this whole betting on
companies that don't make money that one
really confuses me like I've always the
way that I've always believed in running
a business is is small is fine big is
good big is better but profitable is
essential I believe in sustainability
everyone who gets hired at Linus Media
Group should know that even if I fail in
my efforts to go around and get on my
knees and do whatever it is that I need
to do from my knees be it like this or
like whatever else VC capitalists they
need to know that even if my efforts to
raise money from people who just you
know don't know what to spend it on fail
they will still have a job yeah I
believe in that I like not being VC
based it's kind of cool sort of is but
in a different way
like in a quite different yeah so the
way it works is I'm the VC yeah which is
I think that's different yeah and like
I'm directly involved in the company yes
it's not it's not like it's inside
investment that sounds like a bad thing
that what it's called
it's probably not called that cuz that
sounds like sounds sketchy it sounds
something like something illegal but
it's specifically the point is this
whole pure speculation on I'm gonna buy
this stock because like someone else is
gonna look at it and go wow I should
have bought that stock and they're gonna
jump in they're gonna buy it for more
and then I'm gonna sell it like that has
always been scary to me for the same
reasons that cryptocurrency is scary
yeah or putting motors or mortgaging my
house and putting it all on black
is scary like all of those things are
scary to me and so so so I just want to
make sure that even though we're getting
kind of amped because Twitter made money
which I have never seen an ad on Twitter
so I have well okay no they're not has
their promotion I don't see ads so
promotion I actually just like I have
like a learning disability
like I can't or like a visual impairment
we talked about that yeah yeah like I
can't see them where are they they're
kind of hard to see because they're okay
let's let's all let's all go on a
journey to Twitter together let's go to
the home okay so I think you can pay to
get here I'm like wide trends I could be
wrong but sometimes you'll see something
that has like like here this doesn't
have many tweets yeah exactly so there's
ones with like huge amounts of thousands
watch something on Netflix so is this
sponsored but it's not disclosed I have
no idea okay I think you can pay to get
there I don't necessarily know that any
ones that are there right now did I
could also be completely wrong so you
can advertise with Twitter it's not real
clear what you get for your money from
looking at my homepage
detectives homepage anyway chocolate
okay so why don't we go to I don't know
no I won't know where the ads are I
don't know I want to know where to spend
money to buy these suppose it adds I
don't think you Missy any notifications
I think you only see them in home and
moments okay no this is for our network
okay okay so like so this is what I'm
trying to figure out here it's like uh
you know so I think it's really cool
that Twitter made money I can't figure
out how why they made money because I
can't figure out why anybody's buying
advertising on in lots their revenue is
huge yeah it's like seven hundred
million dollars revenue yeah it's not I
mean to be clear like that's nothing
compared to a giant like Google or
Facebook but I'm sure twitch chat is
tearing me apart here they go turn off
adblock I don't have a block yeah
neither of us have a block that's not it
for sure like you know what no I want to
make sure that like that the air is
clear where would adblock be if I had it
up here the only extension you have is
last past yeah but the only extension
that requires an icon but I'm pretty
sure I block like where it where where
would I show my work what shows my
extensions would it show up as an app
I think it's under more tools and then
yeah more tools than extensions so more
tools are tools extensions tangents here
we go
I actually don't really use browser
extensions as you guys can plainly see
okay you have a fair amount but most of
them are not enabled you can see from
the check mark checkmark box so there
you go there's mics there's every
extension I have ever like tried for
five minutes there you go yeah so no ad
blocker is not the issue I just maybe
maybe part of it is that I don't see
them and I don't click on them so maybe
they just stop bothering yeah okay cuz
I'm on mine and I decided that I was
just gonna sit here and just constantly
scroll through home until I got to one
yeah and I haven't I've seen them before
though I have
scene sponsored tweets they definitely
exist I don't use whole a VPN I think I
I think I grabbed it like years ago for
I know what I used it for we did a
sponsored spot for Hulu and I had needed
to get some screen capture of Hulu and I
just needed to go on like their website
so I think that's why I grabbed just
like some because that was prior to our
tunnel bear sponsorship I don't think I
had even heard of tunnel there at the
time yeah so uh so yeah so that's why I
had a couple of randoms like that that's
from like four years ago an actually
insane amount of scrolling and I have
seen zero ads I've scrolled through a
lot of stuff over to saying yeah so yeah
like I just I I don't I don't get it so
so back to so their total advertising
revenue was only up one percent
year-over-year because maybe there's a
lot of people out there who can't find
me ads on Twitter or maybe you know what
you know what it's mid q1 oh no one's
buying yeah maybe just maybe they
actually are just like dude don't have
any ads deserve yeah maybe it yeah I
mean just so you guys know like there's
a there's a very there's a very cyclical
nature to online advertising spending
and we've been doing it long enough yeah
that you know we're very familiar with
the the ABS and the flows so in in
quarter one of any given year since
lioness Media Group has become a thing
we we've been running around with our
hair on fire trying to figure out how
we're gonna survive for the next year
because we do our annual employee
reviews we try to get them finished in
December and during that time everyone
gets sort of the feedback on how things
went this year for the company how
things went for them and a lot of the
time people get raises so and that's
also the time of year that we do all of
our budgeting for
the following year we'll go okay we need
to set aside this much money to hire
this person and this much for that
person and whatever else and then every
q1 like we're not surprised because we
know it's coming okay I'll show that in
a minute
we're not surprised cuz like we know
it's coming but we're always kind of
surprised by the severity because the
calendar flips over figuratively who
uses paper calendars it's ridiculous but
the calendar flips over and like all of
our sponsors are just like yeah we don't
have any budget right now and and
Adsense goes like this and we're just
like oh how are we gonna survive we're
paying people more than we used to but
we're making less than we used to this
is not a good image there's there goes
that bingo pieces so the point is this
happened this happens every year and so
it actually shouldn't surprise me that
much if Twitter doesn't have a lot of
advertising inventory to pump out to the
people who are least likely to click on
it people like me with that said here we
had someone to write this Intuit chat
know is a tweet to both of us - both of
us - both of us know like they tweeted
this screenshot to both of us
oh so one thing to note here is someone
brought this up in the chat as well I
don't know if I want to like promote
this too much what is this I have no
idea don't go to it there you go
yeah this looks like pretty scummy it
does like I've never heard of it it
might be fine but like investment
advertising on Twitter that compares
itself to crypto is like yeah we provide
even better returns than crypto like
what does that even mean it sounds like
it sounds like the worst thing I would
in particular not go there how about
that will give them negative promotion
but yeah like apparently it's more
popular than the mobile app which might
be part of the reason why we're not
seeing it so January so there's less of
them or it's not January but q1 so
there's less of them
and we're not mobile app so there's less
of them got both of those actually does
make okay so there you go Twitter made
money but that doesn't mean that I would
necessarily recommend going and you know
investing your life savings because
revenue is only up 1% as I said before
and 2017 as a whole was down 6% from
2016 yeah which I don't know what that
means if your advertising revenue is up
1% oh maybe they have other sources of
revenue like data cell data I have no
idea I assume so I totally assume so
actually have a lot of it yeah we got to
be careful you know because we don't
want to get caught up in a slander libel
dis bargeman thing so we don't know
there we don't know and mostly that
would end logical that they would we
mostly don't give too two poops and half
of a rat's rear end about sort of
Twitter's financials yeah so someone
just tweeted me this which was they
tagged me in a sponsored post that they
saw in their feed that doesn't show me
that it's sponsored because of how
Twitter works you just make a normal
tweet and then you promote that normal
tweet and it will be promoted to
individual people but if other people
see it it's just a normal tweet so you
can't actually tell like there's no
there's no hashtag add or anything
because it's coming from the actual home
company so that's kind of interesting
actually I just found out why my hard
drive mining test machine wasn't booting
after the power outage what boot drive
got nuked so like it's not the hugest
deal but I need to put a new OS on it no
no all the paw files are still there so
you can just read oh yeah the plot files
are still there it's just it's a pain in
the butt because it has like 25 drives
in it and so I just need to go through
and tediously read all the plots and
like get it all signed in
luckily the plot file names should have
your non-skin sir yeah it was a pain and
no yeah no it does like it's fine it's
just like I mean I plotted all of them
on separate machines already anyway okay
yeah it's just it's the actual rig that
runs it and it's just it's a pain in the
butt because I had a really really hard
time finding a driver that worked for
the LSI controller cards anymore cuz the
problem is that LSI got acquired by
whoever who then got acquired by someone
else
so finding drivers for the old LSI staff
even if there is a current product
that's the same thing as it's just kind
of like a pain in the butt and I figured
it out like a few months ago so I'm just
gonna have to do it from scratch we like
half an hour so it's just like not the
end of the world you know speaking of
1800 burst coins worth a total of like
26 dollars are safe so far by the way
guys the results for mining adventure
sidequest hard drive mining not great if
you have to actually buy a hard drive
for it
not recommended yeah not so much yeah
anyway sorry what were you saying
speaking of not the end of the world but
not recommended have you been watching
the Olympics at all no okay so I haven't
seen anything there's a few different
people talking about how different
coverage has been going and one thing
that I do have to give a show for is CBC
has been great Roxette Olympic Canadian
Broadcasting Company in collaboration
but sure sure they're not a company oh
that makes sense it's been awesome
watching their stuff has been really
great they stream all of it which is
pretty sick it's been interesting though
watching Twitter because I started like
someone that someone mentioned that NBC
sucked for some reason and I was well I
never see who's been great I heard NBC
he's been like cutting off but like
middle of events forever like search for
certain events and then other events
like I think it was ice dance or figure
skating or something they're doing like
picture and picture to make sure we like
see the reaction cam like some of them
they're trying like really hard to cover
really well and then others they just
like don't give a crap okay so anyway
with CBC apparently because a lot of
people been tweeting about it Cutler
yeah
yeah but see you see if you have been
tweeting about this if you run adblock
the stream just keeps going when the ads
are supposed to be running so the
announcers think that the ads are
running and they keep talking really and
it's been pretty bad but like there's
constantly through the CBC there's like
none of this shall be reproduced or like
CBC will come after you basically is
constantly broadcasted so there's not a
lot of clips of it but there's like man
I don't want to effing commentate the
next game bla bla bla bla what if
they're gonna you know uh send any to
our hotels like bad stuff stuff that
should not be on the air no way so
you're not supposed to copy it you're
not supposed to record it and but if
someone did Wow that'll be golden
you know I'm not even convinced that any
scandal matters anymore yeah I mean
you've got a well it made me salty
because I was so happy with how the
CBC's coverage was working their web
streaming was working great you could
watch vod's you could watch live
coverage their commendation was going
really well the the timing of ads was
very sensible everything was super
awesome everyone else was complaining I
was like yes this is great and then coz
like we don't we don't really get
political on the show anymore
but I it's probably worth at least
mentioning that right now the president
of the frickin United States has a porn
star and an ex play mate both of which
have given very credible accounts of
affairs that he had with them and it's
as simple as no it's all a lie never
happened and it's like barely even news
yep and now with deep fakes and all this
other kind of stuff and I'm sure they'll
come up with like a deep fake equivalent
for audio that'll be a bad combination
so yeah like whatever the commentator
said the best advice I can give them
Fenny one from the CBC Suisse or
something yeah no no no you don't even
have to ignore it just be like nope take
news yeah okay
anymore like I I'm at the point now
where I'm kind of looking at it going
but why do I even stress out about this
stuff anymore
yeah like I should find something like
scandalous to do and then just see see
how quickly it goes away gain gain
temporary attention yeah just helpful
yeah and then it'll just disappear do
you have any idea how healthy tampon
gait was for the the overall momentum of
the channel was it because I guess the
bunch people came to watch it to see the
context and stuff and a bunch of them
subscribed and that's where like youtube
saw that video saw it had great traction
and promoted the heck out of the next
few I found it really really interesting
when everyone that hated on X youtuber
not even bring his name up because
that's my whole point
just tweeted out his name and links to
the videos that they are upset about and
we're like I can't believe this is
happening
and I'm like you're just growing his
channel like if you're just saying like
I'm upset this is bad you're not
actually deconstructing the person so
people don't actually really care and
they just want to see what's going on
and then they're like okay let's move on
so you're actually just helping them yep
I mean your anger what are cheers cheers
that's the money we have a top cheer buy
squad tune I think that's what's a
thousand change think $10 really I think
I could be wrong why would anybody give
us $10 I think I'm good yeah I think a
hundred is $1 and on that note brought
to you by fresh blogs the simple
cloud-based accounting solution for

got held up in customs so they sent us a
new box of savage jerky in one day both
of the boxes that they shipped arrived

that might have really been bad bad for
the laptop so much cuz there's actually
so much of it so much savage jerky yunk

this for so long
me too so I'm gonna go for ah ha man my
maple they sent over how much maple

lots of different flavors my personal
favorites are the Moho and the maple
buffalo bacon which I'm gonna crack open

of Jerky's that are made from some of
the hottest peppers in the world
I've got Reapers something about Spanx
you tried the Moho it's a little bit
spicy but it's good they also make spice
Rob they make a hot sauce Oh Brandon
this is anyway um head over to savage
jerky calm or oh wait no Genie dot us
slash savage Turkey I'm gonna link that
in the twitch chat or savage turkey
dot-com with offer code LTTE go check it
out you guys can save 10% over there and
go try it out they've got some really
tasty stuff they've got some really
spicy stuff and they've got some really
spicy stuff that's really tasty and
vice-versa all right so we have managed
to do one news topic so far so we should
probably get a move on let's uh let's do
that so - the screen the original
article hears from the verge it was
posted on the forum by good bites okay
good bites okay love one to ten
Microsoft how about enjoyable merchants
huh okay is he Pro Microsoft or anti
everything else or some combination of
the two I was just going to say why not
both right oh so he posted this on the
forum home pods are apparently staining
wooden tables with a white ring it seems
to have something to do with the rubber
bottom and some kind of a chemical
reaction that takes place
would and to be clear apparently so not
not rapper Sonos does to Apple has
confirmed the issue stating that this is
great the marks can improve over several
days after the speaker is removed from
the wood surface also known as get oh
yeah
the company also recommended that users
try cleaning the surface with the
manufacturer's suggested oiling method
if the white rings don't fail there is
apparently already an accessory so pad
and quill comm is selling and this not
only surely was a leather box this
surely was a leather coaster they
already had oh my Wow go away surely was
something they already had that they are
just calling leather surface protector
for home pod and those absolutely just a
coaster or something 20 bucks you can
get a leather surface protector for the
home pod but surely this is not going to
be the last solution we got a note in
the in the notes from James here
wouldn't Apple have known about this why
didn't they warn consumers you know I
can see this being the kind of thing
that Apple might not have noticed I'm
okay I would probably see I would give
them the benefit of doubt there as well
and I'm kind of king of like no don't do
it but yeah in this case I honestly
would but their response how fast was
their response was within a day or two
so they might have right
right so you're saying anything that
they wouldn't if they didn't take three
to five days to validate it or wait no
right the fact that they think it might
fade in three to five days yeah and they
didn't have three to five days to think
so I would normally give a member doubt
but I think they played their cards
pretty clearly here they must have
already known because they apples king
of just like but I don't know so if they
do totally nothing it Robin they're like
three to five days this is it
bla bla bla bla bla maybe get on our
last one last furniture if it doesn't
fade out in three to five days use this
specific oiling method like I don't know
I I think they knew I would give them
benefit the doubt except yeah I think
they basically told us that they knew
hmm all right well at any rate if they
didn't respond I would say oh yeah I
don't they know I don't think any of my
smart speakers are sitting on you know
what no I do have one I have the Sonos
play three that's sitting on it's
sitting on the UM so I have and it says
Sonos does it too so I have a wardrobe
that has two drawers in the bottom and
then it just has like an open slot where
you can put like you know belts or ties
or something lit and I have a I have a
plate that I don't have any I don't have
any ties and I only have one belt so I
have a so does play three in there so I
should check after check and see if I've
gained this wasn't posted to the forum
apparently James found it over on our
Technica AMD is sending out free
processors to solve firmware flashing
catch-22 apparently so AMD will help you
out if your new motherboard needs a new
bios to work with your new cpu now these
kinds of issues have come up before so
this really surprises me that they would
be doing this
so one of AMD's selling points compared
that's weird
over the last little while has been
forwards and backwards compatibility of
their CPUs and their motherboard and
chips at platforms and for
for most intents and purposes when we're
talking aim to m2 plus m3 what's their
name three plus can't remember for most
intents and purposes this hasn't really
mattered much because there wasn't
really a significant upgrade to make
like anyone who went from an 1100 te
what was that - bin - uh - a piledriver
I think I can't I can't remember all the
code names anyway anyone who went from
there their high performance six core to
their high performance eight core
actually lost performance in a lot of
situations so there wasn't really a
compelling reason to want to
cross-contaminate
your your platform but and the other
thing too is that they were comparing
their self themselves to - Intel whose
notorious for going okay yeah a chipset
has a two-year life span that's it so
one of the big pitches with a m4 was
like hey you're getting you know notice
every a m4 board has has a graphics
output on it you're gonna be able to
take AMD up coming as n based APU so CPU
and GPU combination chips with
integrated graphics are gonna be able to
plug them into these boards and go now
in this case there is a compelling
reason why you might actually want to do
that and aside from upgrading cuz you
wouldn't you wouldn't upgrade to one of
the new I'm not hate calling them ap use
but one of the new CPUs with integrated
graphics you wouldn't really upgrade to
them but there might be boards out there
that have been sitting on a shelf for
the last three months and someone just
goes and like buys it and buys a a new
CPU with integrated graphics that
doesn't work and might be in a situation
where they can't flash their BIOS
without an older-style CPU so basically
what they're doing apparently is we have
kit yeah to flash your firmware so you
actually get a free CPU a dual-core a6
9500 you're supposed to send it back but
you don't have to send the heatsink back
what what the whole thing is just super
weird I'm like do you have to sign some
agreement to get it no because if not I
suspect the majority of people just
won't sign it but here's what I want to
know hey Susan's had this figured out
for like five years
why does everybody else not have CPU
lists
motherboard BIOS flashing sorted out at
this point yeah why is it still hard to
flash a BIOS is it patented that's a
great question I have no idea yeah I
don't know either
but like okay this laptop razors BIOS
flashing method is super simple you
download an exe and you run it and it
updates your system firmware updates our
BIOS and you reboot like how if you
can't get into Windows though that's
been around for a while but that sounds
more complicated to me yeah well the
system is booted up the only thing that
would make sense to me is it's got a
it's gotta be a patent thing because I
really because yeah it it doesn't seem
like it should be that hard right pull
the file off the thing you do that
without an OS because you know why like
I don't know if you remember but back in
the day there was a few games that had
little mini games starting though during
loading screens and that hasn't been a
thing for a long time it's cuz stupid
patent troll was just like huh no it
wasn't a stupid trolls like Atari or
something yeah but then they never did
anything with it
Kaymer quickly I want to see who did it
yeah I'm looking it up already um it's
about to expire apparently Namco Bandai
sorry yeah okay but it's like one of
those like ancient irrelevant like the
self Patterson yeah it's really awesome
yeah it's great and you're just not
allowing anyone to do it really no I
commented on that when I was doing that
video with and that should not be
patentable by the way oh my god so I I
noticed that when I was doing the video
with my son on the K know that it has
their flappy their stupid flappy bird
clone oh dear
on the loading screen yeah yeah and I
was like wow this is great why doesn't
everybody do this and then the comments
just full of people being like yeah
because they can't idiot
thank you commenters I really appreciate
you and your comments owner Kano got in
trouble for that I miss Jim Carrey like
yes he done lately Oh other than just
like being bizarre on social media and
on camera and stuff yeah oh there's a
movie it's on camera uh he's he's I
don't want to get into it just because I
say something wrong
but he's yeah I don't want to get too
far into it I see it
nothing like yeah nothing too crazy or
something yes this is part of the reason
why I don't want to get too into it
there's there's been some oh there's
been a civil suit against and something
to do with that interesting this is part
of the problem the fact that this is
happening at all apparently is like
extremely mentally straining which makes
sense yeah so there's been some pretty
intense bouts of nihilism stuff it's a
very sad situation depending on whether
or not it's true and all this kind of
stuff and I don't know and bubble butt
but yeah it's been a little a little
complicated for a little while and I
feel like it's gonna be an extremely
polarizing thing hi
interesting okay then um moving on to
other tech news all right then oh excuse
me all righty then oh um are you allowed
to say that like if you can patent or
like trademark lets get ready to rhumble
in the way that he said it can you do
like other catchphrases
I assume something wearing a savage
jerky shirt I am or such a sellout I was
so excited when I heard we had more it's
my first food for the day so like thank
you for feeding me sponsor I appreciate
it
also clothing me we're doing good we're
doing good you put a roof over my head
and we're done actually sort of do can I
help you you know you can't have more
you were already here you need the whole
bag already wait the whole bag well
that's what you get for sharing yeah
what did we learn
sharing is losing things okay so Google
to tweak Image Search to help protect
photographer copyrights
so it used to be that it was as simple
as this yeah images may be subject to
copyright which was Google's way
basically right well because they don't
know because they don't know and because
they don't care so they have removed the
view image button that was next to it
that would directly linked to the
high-res photo and they're gonna make
that copyright notice more prominent for
users so let's see this middle click or
right click and open the new tab so this
change is a result of a partnership
between Google and the stock photo
agency Getty Images which has been
lodging anti-competitive complaints
against Google for making
high-resolution stock photos easily
downloadable through Google images so
they're saying this is a benefit to all
image owners globally we expect it to
have a positive impact on traffic to our
site less than 24 hours later oh this is
fun there are already browser extensions
for Chrome and Firefox that bring the
buttons back
however these extensions probably won't
last long especially on Chrome the
change won't stop people from using
copyrighted images but it does add a
little bit more inconvenience unless you
use James's meth
which guy is the right-click on the
image and select open image and new tab
doesn't seem propel that's James's
method here's what I want to know if
there's any programmers out there
watching that are sort of looking for a
weekend project that would make my life
a little bit better what I want to know
is and maybe this exists I just haven't
been able to find it so its copyright
checker or something no I'm an important
thing yeah no I don't know I wanted to
look for something important here's ten
important things to simplify your life
copy link address oh why did that work
what when does that not work no it
usually has Google's crap attached to it
oh the pictures look at a picture look
at a picture oh is it only pictures I
think it's pictures what wow there's no
important pictures okay um and like if
you copy that
if you copied the search know that I'm
not talking about it talking about when
you just like right click so yeah okay
this junk yeah okay can someone make an
extension that removes all this like is
that possible because if you if you just
mouse over it oh no it is it is the
stupid yeah okay
still how it must not leak is to open
this search with that thing extended if
I remember correctly okay and there's
another issue in you can maybe make
something that copies the click-through
link like what's the thing that makes it
like impossible to copy paste things
into hangouts I can't remember exactly
what it is but you know that issue where
if you try to paste if you try to just
link someone to something in hangouts
you can't send them an exact URL it it
hang out suffice it so there's like a
couple things like that that are really
frustrating how about just stripping all
that stuff out with an extension I would
download the crap out of that extension
so you'd be among the like very small
handful of extensions apparently there
is a grease monkey or tampermonkey
script for that I just haven't been able
to find it link cleaner and Firefox
apparently but I don't want a Firefox
thing because hey Quantum's yeah
quantum was really unstable the last
time I tried no I don't think so
okay as far as I can tell right now
based on like a machine by machine basis
not even person my person just
my machine either quantum is super
unstable or Croma super unstable just
won't get just one of them and it's on
like a machine by machine basis most of
the machines that I have of course I
just get randomly assigned out this
happens every show I've no idea right on
most machines that I have it's it's
Chrome but there's I've definitely heard
reports from people that they like can't
use Chrome because it just crashes all
the time which I've basically never seen
or heard of that but they use quantum
and it runs perfectly fine all the time
on both my main machines quantum just
crashed and like full system lock
because of quantum constantly so I don't
know I'm not sure I would love to use
Firefox again but when it like
significantly negatively impacts my work
productivity then I just I can't all
right there's some confusion around in
videos code games the original article
is from Digital Trends apparently Nvidia
may reveal dedicated Turing crypto
mining cryptocurrency mining cards in
March what I find that very hard to
believe and this is even this is a
little confusing given rumors about
ampere which is supposedly locked and
loaded and ready to replace and videos
current gaming based cards on the Pascal
architecture so right now it's pretty
unclear what the crap is going on over
there and they're pretty good about
keeping these things private so yeah I
think everyone's initial thought was
that Volta was gonna come to everything
but this may be the generation that
Nvidia not only so it was only recently
even that they started doing a different
die even for the data center parts but
this may be the generation where we get
a completely different architecture for
the data center parts very interesting
this is pretty huge way mo gets okay for
first driverless ride-hailing service
Wow alphabets way mo so that that Google
parent company got a permit in late
January from the Arizona Department of
Transportation to operate as a
transportation network company this
allows way Mo's fleet of driverless
chrysler pacifica minivans to pick up
and drop off paying riders in Arizona
through a smartphone app or website that
will compete with uber and lyft so
Google alphabet that group kind of is
directly competing with uber and lyft
now Wow the service will initially have
thousands of cars prices could be
competitive given those there's no
driver to pay and so last year they
started a free early rider program in
the Arizona Capitol where hundreds of
people used a lame-o app to Hale and use
cars within a hundred square mile radius
in November they began testing vehicles
and parts of the city without a driver
at the wheel I kind of suspect that in
Fast business a lot yeah well I and
another interesting thing here is my
brain went to okay so it's got to be
cheaper cuz no driver then I was like
okay but they cycle through the vehicles
really fast because it's a lot of wear
on them to drive literally all day but
then they can almost definitely just
move the driverless tech from vehicle
the route vehicle so they'll have to
swap out like engines and vans and stuff
yeah they can probably just move over a
lot if not all of the automated driving
tech so that's interesting that could be
way cheaper Google could come in and
just be like this is the better option I
mean you don't have to worry about when
you're in Las Vegas and you're going to
Las Vegas Convention Center your driver
ends up being like super racist and
super sexist
that was incredible you heard about that
I did hear about that so I'm then um
hold on a second hey max are you over
there cool can I tell about your awful
cabbie or do you want to tell people
about your awful cabbie okay okay so so
basically max is in this
okay and the driver starts going off
about here we go
women drivers right Asian drivers
Canadians
I mean Italians there wasn't there one
more French Canadians Asians Canadians
women Italians wasn't young people young
young women especially 25 year olds
explicitly managed managed I think there
was more to racist sexist or otherwise
prejudiced comments about five things
all of which max is either is somewhere
from fifty to a hundred percent all in
the span of what n to fifteen minute
drive look at what yeah it wasn't even
and not only started like halfway
through like he was working through he
was on a mission and the best thing
about this sort of um depending on your
perspective like if you appreciate the
ironic use of the word best the best
thing about it is that it was even
pointed out that Max was oh yeah young
female Asian Canadian half Italian yeah
Wow
and like clearly no one in the car was
down with the conversation
frosty universe says sounds like he
comments on YouTube videos yeah sounds
about right but yeah one of the
terrifying things is if they start doing
these ride-sharing apps they'll gather
obscene amount of data of like how
driving works on automated driving and
stuff so if this becomes a thing it's
gonna massively advance all the rest of
it grow exponentially yeah yeah and like
the transport industry is huge the
United people that work in the transport
industry is huge and there's certain
parts of transport industry that'll hold
for a little while longer
oh yeah well you'll still need to be
maintained yeah yeah
and like certain specific thing like
very high like black car and limo might
still have a person because being served
by a person like having someone come out
and open your door and all I can stuff
might be nice so people that are like
super ballin might still pay for that
and very specialized transport stuff I'm
sure will still be covered but a to be
driving someone says it's not hate
speech if you hate everyone well there's
actually a couple of other pretty
ridiculous comments here first of all
max is a stupid Nate who names a girl
max names Maxine I expect better from
the twitch chat and no I don't never
mind mom have you recall someone Bob
yeah their full name is very likely not
Bob yeah it's bobert all right and so
moving on to what we've got on Flo
playing this week yeah I think we're
gonna do someone watching named Bob Byrd
I'm sorry bubbles down the show pretty
quick here cuz I think I'm pretty much
done all right what do we got over there
um ooh we've got the home pod versus the
Google home max I watched the very end
of this gold uh yes the very end is
definitely gold we've got the job
posting that I think is actually up on
YouTube now so we're hiring again I'm in
snowboarding and the guy that got me my
equipment was like I want to apply i
applied in the past i didn't make it is
for the writers catchment thing oh yeah
he's like but i'm here i want to apply
again i'm like dude we're hiring soon
yeah there it is
yeah uh this is a good video you guys
are gonna like it
our review sample cpu's cherry-picked
 viewers say
Epis one retail chip engineer example
which one performs better and we did
both Intel and Andy have you talked
about like the history of this though
yep okay Oh like in the video we did
because it's happened I don't know what
the results of this are I haven't seen
it but liquid metal laptop cooling 20
degrees cooler that's really cool
no lies what the crap is floating-point
performance everyone talks about it a
lot of people I'm not gonna say most
people you know what most people have no
idea what it is written to programming
at the same time panic attack under 100
mostly gaming there's actually some
really cool stuff this is a credit card
sized game console it's literally in
your in your wallet that's cool um else
we got here
alright that's most of it oh yeah Oh 120
Hertz PC gaming on a TV still isn't up
so that'll go up pretty soon and I think
that pretty much wraps it up alright so
we will see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel oh boy now to
consume more vaping yep
so many people think bingo yeah
all right please man when we don't have
like big technical streams in when we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
