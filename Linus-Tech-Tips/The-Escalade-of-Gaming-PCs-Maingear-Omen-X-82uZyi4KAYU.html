cases lately on Linus tech tips and
we've gotten a lot of frustration from
the community for not showing off larger
designs more often and you know what we
heard you so we got in touch with main
gear who partnered with HP to bring us
this the omen X the rotated cuboid whose
HP rendition we first checked out back
at CES in January at $599 for the case
alone that version may have tilted some
of you but if price is a non concern for
you well you'd be looking at the mad
baller main gear version that sports a
mad baller price tag to match anyway I
mean go big or go home
am i right
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below so let's take it
from the top the almanacs has a gigantic
package I mean when it first arrived
that is the first thing that you will
notice but that's a good thing when you
consider the omen X's weight at over 50
pounds it is certainly something that
you will think twice before moving
especially if you've got to go up and
down the stairs like we had to but who
says big can't be beautiful
the HP version is nice but what a job
main gear did on this one done up with a
gorgeous coat of blue automotive paints
and some other tweaks so we've got the
main gear logo in place of the omen logo
on the front panel that sports
individually addressable quadrants of
RGB lighting on the right we've got our
front i/o including two USB type-c ports
and down below we've got a DVD burner ok
well in fairness it can be equipped with
a blu-ray drive if you want but main
gear wisely assumed that we wouldn't
care if they put a piece of new car
scented blue cardboard in there anyway
around the back we've got our rear i/o
which thankfully reveals an
off-the-shelf motherboard from a soos
and not a proprietary HP omen board as
well as our power supply and huh what's
this screw here well let's just remove
it and now press this button and whoa
that side panel just opened like a car
door very cool and looking even deeper
inside oh yeah we are GB now boys sorry
I got carried away there anyway in here
we find one of our three cooling zones
and here the motherboard and GPUs live
alongside a 120 millimeter radiator
front with our reservoir and a 240
millimeter radiator up top
pulling exhausts duty we can't help at
this point but to tear up a little bit
gazing upon the gorgeous hard line
tubing job main gear has painstakingly
done for this unit it includes a
whopping 75 chrome fittings and no bends
apparently this helps prevent damage in
shipping our blocks are running in
parallel in our loop and all of them
contain a delightful pastel blue coolant
reminiscent of delicious liquefied
Smurfs but if you look closely you'll
see that our loop actually extends into
the bottom chamber to where the Corsair
ax 1200 I is housed it's a little tough
to access but down there you'll actually
find a third radiator to complete the
cooling system I mean this thing packs
some serious cooling capacity all right
there - what's in the third chamber
drive bays for days well for drive bays
anyway for four days but they're cool
ones all four are hot swappable with
locking mechanisms and cloth pull tabs
that let you slide out trays big enough
to accommodate up to three and a half
inch hard drives while we did report
though at CES that The Omen ex would
support you dot two drives ours doesn't
this isn't the end of the world for and
now there's a ton of selection in you
dot two drives but we are looking
forward to seeing future configurations
with that option nudge-nudge so with all
of that together we've got a ba AF
machine that should be more than capable
of handling high-end work like 3d
rendering and video editing all the way
down to more pedestrian tasks like 4k
gaming which I can't believe I just said
starting off then with our gaming tests
we can see that right off the bat main
gears factory overclocked has given them
quite a bit of headroom over the stock
configuration so it's not all for show
then and
I imagine if you wanted to really sit
down and grind out the voltage tweaks
for an unreasonably long period of trial
and error you could probably push both
the 69 50 X CPU and the 10 80 TI GPUs
even further but that's a little outside
the scope of a normal system review but
with that said maybe we'll get a chance
to take a closer look at an omen X in
the future maybe after thread Ripper
anyway this is an expensive system but
this is main gear so you have to expect
it these guys hand build every unit they
send out the door and hand overclocked
them to I mean during the course of this
video our motherboard actually developed
a fault and they flew the guy who built
the system to make the repair for us and
well they won't necessarily do that for
every end user it does show a level of
commitment that we've never seen before
even towards us from a system builder
and it also highlights something very
important that we brought up in our
recent review of the digital storm bolt
X and that is that hard line tubing is a
pain and a half to maintain even if it
looks stunning and this one is one
stunning series of tubes that artistry
and support though like I said doesn't
come cheap and as configured we are
sitting at ten and a half thousand US
dollars
even our balls-to-the-wall test bench
parts cost less than half of that so
then just like the bull techs The Omen X
isn't for an enthusiast who likes to get
their hands dirty but rather it's for
someone who wants a unique looking rig
with an utterly one-of-a-kind water
cooling setup that compromises are
nothing without the hassle and with full
support if something goes wrong is it
for you well that depends just how much
of a baller you are and also how
cube-shaped you like your balls want to
learn something
check out Skillshare it's an online
learning community for creators with
more than 15,000
classes in design business technology

month free trial whoo
so thanks for watching guys is this
video suck you know what to do but it
was awesome hit that like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the system we featured in
the video description also down there we
have our merch store which has cool
t-shirts like this one as well as our
community forum which you should totally
join to go talk tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
