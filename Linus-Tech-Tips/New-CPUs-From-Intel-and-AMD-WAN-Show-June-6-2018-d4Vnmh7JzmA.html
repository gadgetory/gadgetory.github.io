show this week we have John it's been a
while it has been a while I do you not
remember the last time no I don't I
wonder I vaguely remember a Santa hat
maybe
so Hinton has probably been the Y okay
but that might have been the like I've
done this every year where I bring each
person onto the show at the end yeah
when I got stuck at the US border people
are saying John but they're spelling it
wrong oh no someone else felt it right
that happens literally every time like
it happens to me on Twitter and my name
is right there it's on in Twitter if
they send you a message it has the at
and then the correct spelling of your
name and if you're on the forum you
might know in my signature I say I spell
my name without an H people still get it
wrong so I'm just I'm used to it by now
I don't even notice anymore
yeah well that's a live I do but you
know my problem is that I know like
three different spellings of John well
no wonder the more Johnny I guess oh
yeah his is like actually kind of weird
for a Johnny what is cuz it's five
letters yeah yeah so I don't know yeah
we're talking about the guy that does
some of our staff report here who was
also my landlord funnily enough and and
people have seen him on camera yeah so
yeah Johnny's Johnny's basically the
nicest person on the entire planet but
he can't make it too so every single
year I will get into the show and aside
don't worry but every single year since
I was like 15 I've been going to PAX
West and I bring all my friends every
time and Johnny can't make it this time
really very weird it's actually like
very very weird that he's not gonna be
that really estranged the rest of people
that have been good that are gonna be
going or all like it's so weird that
Johnny's what are we gonna do I don't
know I feel like he would be the straw
that serves a drink so to speak yeah
yeah so it'll be interesting but should
be good this week we have interesting
news because like Computex is happening
and e3 is right around the corner and
all this kind of stuff there's
interesting stuff going on we don't have
a lot of gaming news quite yet because I
think that'll probably be next week but
we've got Intel news a unnamed 28 core
56 thread CPU we've got news about
second gen thread Ripper being on try
for a q3 2018 launch that means this
year also massive changes to the seam
store we were talking about this
recently on a LAN show it's gonna be
crazy I actually think it's super cool
but we'll talk about that later there's
an obscene amount of notes on that AMD
unveiling a 7 nanometre GPU that's
insane
gigabyte making fake ram and it's
actually really cool so it's kind of
like bonded leather and then actually my
favorite news of this week even though
it doesn't necessarily sound super cool
see sonic introducing SCM d and your
cable clutter it's amazing I can't show
you what it is right now I'm getting one
for suresies but we'll have to talk
about the survey's I'm constantly
kicking the cables underneath my desk in
my office
it won't help you with that it's like
cables inside your cap off but it's
super cool we'll go there later boom it
worked this week is going well yes it
was going well it's wide eyed again
really
also Anthony Bourdain died yes I know
very sad he was what 61 I think I don't
know I like him fresh ba ba shocks LTX
be there or or don't but preferably be
there if you can because it's cool and
I'd like to say hi also Squarespace yeah
gonna put this back up here and we're
back boom ok that's all it takes
when show intro completed let's move up
to the top because we've got this crazy
Intel processor that has some
interesting news coming with it thank
you by the way to vegetable stew and
radiating light for some vegetable stew
I see we did there oh the very clever oh
yeah and I post this link in the wind
doc you look like you had something to
say do you I was just commenting on
vegetables too although I did cover this
today well James covered it but I wrote
the thing today for tech link on this
story oh ok yeah so do you have any
interesting quips from that because you
definitely know more about it than I do
I have some interesting things to bring
up but ok you thank you ok well without
I guess without running through the
bullet pool
first so I'll give a quick TL DR yeah so
Computex intel shows off this 28 core 56
thread cpu and it is demo of it and it
was like oh man the CPU is running at 5
gigahertz is so cool
so after it happened a few people know
you said there was a gigantic weird like
industrial water chiller sticking out
the back of the unit I think they had it
set up such that you couldn't see it
straight on when they were actually
doing the demos so but that wasn't even
like the worst of it
they also said this chip is running at 5
gigahertz not telling people that had
actually in fact been overclocked so a
lot of people were thinking that oh this
thing is just going to run this freaking
28 cord Xeon so it's gonna run a 5
gigahertz out of the box which was not
the case at all Intel got called out on
that they had to acknowledge it and then
they ended up saying oh well they blamed
it on quote-unquote the excitement of
the moment or something like that and
they said that their guy running the
demo just forgot you forgot to say oh by
the way this is not running at stock
speed so people were very understandably
upset about that's so lame but honestly
I can kind of understand if it's just
the demo guy that forgot to say it now
if there was like press documents given
out to any degree it should have it in
there and I guys shouldn't forget
admittedly I'm not sure if there were
documents hand out but I have not I
think it was just whoever was running
the demo said 5 gigahertz if I'm come on
man don't forget that so the processor
is clocked at 2.7 gigahertz normally and
without revealing turbo speeds they
haven't done they were able to overclock
it to 5 gigahertz which is pretty crazy
the demo setup was cooled by an $850
aquarium chiller which yeah seems which
the chiller alone consumes 1200 watts
and is meant to be able to cool a
thousand liters of law so we have just
found an actual use if you buy a 1600
watt power supply we finally found a
real-world you say you run a 400 watt
computer
the 1200 watt chili I'll be sick I'd
love to see that so yeah it's it's
pretty cool we'll have to see how
freakin hot this thing actually gets
normally and how high you can overclock
it with reasonable cooling solutions and
I'm sure Linus will be all over that if
I'm reasonable like was a 400 millimeter
I ate a reasonable or that's fairly
aggressive yeah but it's not the same
it's been way more reasonable than this
is a query yeah yeah yeah like even like
a triple personally I would like to see
a double red a double 120 or double 140
yeah that that's very if you whatever
you can overclock it on that that's
solid because I think that's probably
where most people kind of are and when
they're yeah like really wanted to be an
overclock a nice thick thi CC but still
regular-sized radiator yeah yeah with
that so next up in crazy processor news
we've got a post from Alex solo thank
you very much saying that the
second-generation thread Ripper is on
track for a q3 2018 launch it's AMD
Zeppelin silicon let me get this on
screen and in the twitch discipline so
we've moved away from like earth moving
material and now we're doing flips and
awesome music mm-hmm okay there we go
cool twelve nanometer thirty-two
sixty-four second gen features I know a
lot of people are saying like oh it's
it's not it's not the most exciting
processor ever rip rip rip rip rip I
don't care
is there well I mainly just stoked that
they're continuing to step forward
instead of abandoning for a huge section
of years again well if they're anything
is like a most exciting process or ever
any more even just with the white LEDs
there's some really exciting computer
hardware later on in the show I am so
stoked for this you have no idea I think
most of people in shadowing Blakey on
but I think it's amazing so don't worry
about but yeah I think this is super
cool it's I think it's great that
they're pushing forward again with
thread Ripper going with their big heavy
hitter as well bringing out another one
definitely that
supercool they're not backing down it's
32 64 which is sick I'm really excited
for this process that's insane um 250
watt TDP boom so boom many don't even
care
super cool mm-hmm not not in a literal
sense but yeah nice and warm actually
they've they've got it displayed next to
some Nhu 14 s's which aren't even that
huge so that's not too bad
that's a beautiful looking board good
job at Messiah
I like that aesthetic that's cool
that one too well hey soos I want at
school boards these days
I like that like when I first got into
computers it was like oh wow you got a
board with a black PCB yeah it's amazing
having a non green like what it felt
like back in what like 2009-2010 it was
like oh the PCB is blue by this and that
was it
yeah yeah yeah and now we have like like
this one has like under lighting that's
RGB like metal accents and like
aggressive little thing or the I Oh like
they look so cool now I don't know
that's pretty sweet but yeah this is
cool I'm very happy that they're they're
launching another processor I know some
people aren't that interested like I was
saying earlier
ambi Zeppelin silicon has eight cores
and it's the first generation thread
Ripper and the first generation thread
of ur uses two of them to get the top
skew of 16 cores that's written a little
oddly but hopefully that makes sense
yeah
moving on did it do yeah I think that's
pretty much about it yeah rumors are
saying August and there's no pricing yet
yeah so coming up hopefully hopefully
you got the dollar bills for it if you
need 64 threads yeah I was going to say
if you need that if you need that it's
probably for some type of work
application so hopefully it's I would
say almost certainly for work yeah like
maybe there's someone out there just
really likes benchmarking just freaking
loves it or like is just really really
into editing home videos in like wicked
quality yeah exactly like it like
someone else I need to have cinema level
my kid playing boss just spent like five
figures and like a red or something and
like I need yes I need to look make the
driveway ball hockey yeah look like it
was put together by I need to fill my
kids schooling the neighbor kid in
hockey with a red yeah and then edit it
very efficient so when they send like
the kids like hockey mix takes the
junior leagues they're gonna be like the
production values are amazing
moving on to the next topic posted by
matrix 0 7 0 12 James and I were someone
is yelling what the heck so I don't know
which got to hear that but James and I
were talking about this last week
twitch took a game down where you were a
school shoot which Steen did
sorry steam did ok completely I don't
know I just I said twitch because I was
clicking on the twitch tab and it just
like invaded my brain but yes this team
took a game down because it was like
about a school shooter mm-hmm also
twitch chat apparently heard the yell so
Thank You Ava but yeah and my stance on
that was essentially if twitch wants to
do this if this is within twitches
policies why do I keep saying twitch its
steam wants to do this and this is
within steams policies maybe I suggest
putting recently yeah you're actually
turning red I don't like saying the
wrong thing man let's go yeah you
probably can't tell a whole but this
time this guy looks like a lobster right
now that's like to me so I have very
pale skin so it shows release yeah it's
it's that Scandinavia and me but yeah I
think it's completely within their right
to take it down some people were
screaming for free speech and I'm like
this isn't a government platform it's
it's a company if they don't want to
have yeah they can they can do basically
everywhere with it yeah but I also
really like what they ended up doing
which is saying that we don't care
anymore
yeah so what they're doing now is
they're only removing items that are
actually illegal or straight-up trolling
you don't quote from them so but unless
it's one of those two things then the
game is probably fine so yeah so like my
my stance on this is interesting because
people there's actually surprising
mounted people that have asked me about
this
because of how I run the forum and how I
run floatplane because they're actually
so different on the forum things get
axed yeah all the time this is a tech
forum stop screwing around we're gonna
it's a little bit different though
because you're on the forum you have to
like keep peace between users or a falls
apart this is just a story if you don't
it yeah if you don't want to act
interact with anyone you don't have to
and it's also like the the center of the
topic here is supposed to be games yeah
not a type of game and the center of the
thing on the forum is tech news you guys
are tech stuff in general I was thinking
the tech news section but the computer
to stuff tech stuff gaming stuff whatnot
if you're going outside of that it might
make sense an off topic but if it's too
far like we're not we don't a mess with
that kind of stuff there's a tech
focused forum floatplane on the other
hand is a website for creators if you
are a user and you go on floatplane and
you don't want to see a certain type of
content don't give the person who makes
that content your money and you won't
see it it's fairly straightforward hmm
so I don't really care what people do on
the platform and I don't I don't want to
care
I can I can have the stance personally
where I'm like as a personal human being
as Luke I don't like this content mm-hmm
I don't necessarily hope that they do
well I don't hope that they have a big
audience so I'm just gonna vote with my
wallet but I'm going on facilitate their
platform and be impartial because okay I
am acting on behalf of a platform and I
will do nothing to hinder them in any
way because that would be bad were you
saying that the steam store was allowing
the school shooting game where they took
it down I think they took it down
oh why I think that was because right
now they're they're going with the allow
everything approach but I believe they
took it down and I believe they're
keeping it down because I'm pretty sure
the guy that made it was already banned
from releasing games and he made it as a
troll okay which they are reserving the
right to kick off another interesting
question is what even is a game
because you can publish stuff on Steam
is it a game if it's a visual novel and
you just click Next constantly doesn't
respects yes it now make it a game if
there's multiple options to click Next
that still could be a visual novel it's
just a choose-your-own-adventure visual
novel does that make it a game does that
not make a game it's a it's an
interesting conversation what's up um so
this is why this is why I've sort of
been like silent for a second um because
I think so okay Rios needs policy change
follows two platforms banning of
controversial school shooting simulation
game a computer so yes you were you were
correctly they they took this down yeah
yeah but I think so like I think what
this is saying is that they would have
left it up mm-hmm
but yeah this guy was already banned off
the platform yeah they are they think
he's trolling he's a notorious troll he
has a record of having terrible customer
service and also kind of like there's
other reasons why they wanted to take
this thing down so I think they're
leaving it down because of those reasons
gotcha
it's it's gonna be an interesting time
because I think this is gonna spawn not
that there isn't already but I think
it'll spawn an incredible amount more of
garbage on Steam there is already a lot
of garbage because there's no law
against like a bad game yeah so yeah
yeah yeah I know I know what you mean so
so they have yeah they've it's it's
interesting and another thing that they
were talking about is how apparently
there was a lot of controversy in the
community as to whether or not they
should allow everything or they should
ban a whole bunch of different stuff or
whatever there was a lot of controversy
in the community right a lot of people
were angry that they took this game down
I'm not first of all I don't care
second of all I think it's their right
to do whatever they want is their
platform and third of all they already
didn't like the publisher bad customer
service troll band already in the past
so there's many reasons but some people
were very upset that they took it down
some people were very
some people think they should have taken
it down some people think they shouldn't
took basically and what's valve has said
is internally apparently they've had
essentially that same war they have like
the same spectrum of people that are
outside talking about this inside the
company
so they've essentially decided if if the
community is all mixed and we're all
mixed we'll kind of let the community
sort it out well yeah I mean you talk
about like a lot of trash potentially
showing up on the platform but you know
this is the same for like the app store
or this is the same for Google Play
there was a lot of stuff there that all
that Google or Apple have done have
vetted to say this does not contain
malware but other than that there's no
guarantees of the quality of what you're
buying but the model still works
especially on Steam or I feel like it's
easier to filter out stuff that you
don't want to see as far as like
recommendations or whatever I do think
they'll need to do a much better job of
categorizing and filtering things I hope
they do some suggestions already but
they need to amp up that system I know
that they plan on making it so there's
parental controls in terms of what stuff
you can see and what stuff you can't see
obviously that's gonna have to come in
so like theoretically you wouldn't be
able to see active shooter or a game
with wives or something yeah banging
simulator 2019
unless you have your settings to be to
be allowed to see those types of waifu
banging simulator it's 2019 it's yeah
it's next year
yeah 10% more Paul already yeah it's
amazing it's the best game if it even is
a game I don't know moving on to my
favorite thing in this show I don't know
if everyone else is gonna agree with me
but I think it's frickin fantastic I'm
getting one for suresies this was posted
by wmk groom a K on the forum it is a PC
per article and it's from C sonic it is
the C Sonic SC MD let's have a look at
this thing it's the system cable
management device that's what they
because well you know what I would say
you think they would come up with like
if they're gonna have a four letter name
they could do something sexy
you know let the NZXT puck or whatever
it is and oh yeah
CMD doesn't zoomed skimmed I'm just
gonna go down to the store and buy some
Scribd so what's cool about this is it's
this bar what is this sound good umm
someone is shuffling through some
equipment over there
sorry about that twitch chat but it and
youtube later on but it's this bar that
you can put into the back of your
computer you can see there's some SSDs
mounted here and stuff and you plug all
your power supply cables into the bottom
of the bar and then you branch off them
later on higher up so it's yeah speaking
of NZXT they have a few of their cases
on a second of the s3 40s note for this
they have the cable management bar
built-in but this one looks a little bit
more like a one size fits most kind of
solution yes and my understanding of it
right now it's like because in this
picture in this picture it shows that
it's connected directly to the power
supply but this bar you can see is off
by itself there like I don't know I
don't have a ton of pictures of this
thing but my understanding is that you
should be able to get it separately
that's what yeah it kind of I mean if
they're going on if they're one in or if
they're going to introduce this thing
called the Scoon it'll make a big deal
out of it you would think that you could
buy without buying the see sonic power
supply so apparently that is an RGB logo
so this see sonic logo is RGB and that's
am a little bit surprised by this
because it's RGB see Sonic's whole like
mo is a company they're very like
straightforward not a whole lot of
frills like if any of y'all if y'all
follow see sonic on Twitter you probably
know what I'm talking about
but the stuff they make is pretty good
so I really like even something even we
were not compensated to say that just
personal opinion but um but well if you
look at my personal rig business you
sonikuh right ya know dude has a see so
yeah that's right but yeah even if that
was not an you know just always say even
something is you know a simple provision
of an RGB logo surprises me a bit but I
think it looks pretty sharp yeah yeah
yeah like even their prime power
supplies there's no RGB on it but yeah
apparently it does drop your efficiency
by one percent overall that's really not
a lot my main thing is in in
what it looks like this case right here
in my case at home kill management in
the back of tempered glass cases
especially when there's not a big gap
he's a nightmare
yeah and Nestle really good yeah and
that's the trend now isn't it because
yes you're seeing more more cases that
even like reasonable price points were
tempered glass all the way around and I
think there was just an assumption that
people thought this would be cool and
that has been true to a degree but
there's also plenty of you out there
that just want to hide all the messy
cable routing behind a motherboard tray
so it looks like it can power some fans
or those who see this though are those
fans are those SATA I think you're right
yeah those who look like fan cables yeah
everything is seems like it's seemingly
intelligently placed to like this looks
like a SATA bridge coming right off of
there the really short run directly just
as you have some right there
so she's right up at the top and it's
your CPU power 24 pins right off on that
side like it looks like it does as long
as you're not running some like weird
exotic set where you have like SATA
headers like all the way up towards the
top it looks like it's probably fine for
a millet system even then it might work
I just I don't have very good pictures I
don't know yeah and this okay to be fair
this little blue cable I just realized
almost certainly doesn't come with it
these are probably after markets mm-hmm
maybe they seldom is like a kit the
light goes with it we'll have to see I
don't know a ton about it right it could
just be cable ma cables I don't know but
but I actually think that's really cool
that's that's the first I have this
happened to every show I don't know why
Google Docs decides to sign me out part
way through every single time that's so
annoying that's happened to me before
when I would try to upload tech will
keep videos thanks Google but but it's
the first time in a long time that I've
looked at a piece of computer hardware
and been like I am going to buy that
basically now and put it in my system
right away the one percent efficiency
drop is really funny to me not because I
do think it's good that they're being
transparent about it but I can see
someone out there with like an 80 plus
power supply like the lowest year of 80
plus and they hook this thing up to it
they're like oh well it was my superior
efficiency to to that to that you know
rade max power supply might we'll be a
neighbor blog whatever so apparently
will condone any sizes which makes sense
there's probably like general I TX cases
general mhm yeah yeah you know I and I
know I said this before but I'm still
baffled as to why M ATX is not a more
popular thing if you're a gamer it's
like the most logical form factor to get
but that's a different discussion so
yeah I think it's I like it and it's
really not popular but I have no idea
why but on that note of having no idea
why I have no idea why if you are making
a new website and don't have a website
yet for your like small business or self
or whatever you don't check out square
space they have 24/7 live chat and email
support so if you have any problems I
have no idea why you wouldn't just
contact them also it's only 12 bucks a
month and you get a free domain if you
subscribe for a year they have
responsive design so it looks great on
your various devices like your phone
your tablet your laptop your your watch
your desktop whatever your TV doesn't
even matter
they have commerce modules so you can
have a free built in an online store if
you want to sell some stuff which is
really cool no screw off don't restart I
pick a time which is not now we're just
having some slight cat days 9 p.m. I
hate Windows 10 why are we using Windows
10 on this computer anyways moving on
cover pages if you want to have like a
one simple page setup which is just good
for like resumes or cover letters or
like hey look at me this is my about me
page it's perfect for that also everyone
can now publish content in the Apple
news format directly from their
Squarespace blog module which makes it
available to millions of potential users
because there's tons of people on that
you start a trial with no credit card
required and start building your website
today when you do decide to sign up
check out this link right here
Squarespace squarespace.com slash win
and offer and put an offer code when to
save 10% off your first purchase you
know I also have problems saying
Squarespace whenever I do it whenever I
do a Squarespace thing for tech wookiee
I say score space
Squarespace almost said why did I do
this done that before yeah maybe it was
like your presence oh my god not now I'm
just ruining the rest of like our
productions now anyway I hope why this
isn't so yeah lot to ruin things like
your accounting and like your write offs
you could use fresh books you should use
fresh book to keep track of everything
fresh books just a super simple
invoicing tool that actually does a lot
more than just invoices it helps you
keep track of your invoices it helps you
keep track of your expenses it helps you
keep track of your hours all that kind
of stuff it keeps track of who owes you
what which is great it also has a
feature that tells you when your client
to look at it invoice for the first time
and it has a mobile app which has all
the functionality of their desktop
application which is really good because
a lot of new business owners just use
phones to run through their stuff so
they can move around and do things you
can take fresh books wherever you go
which is great you have any questions
feel free to reach out to their support
staff where you'll speak to a human no
phone tree no escalations no return
calls just answers also visit fresh book
Stockholm / Wayne and it's your when and
how do you hear about a section when you
sign up to get a free trial which is
pretty cool and speaking of pretty cool
LTX you're pretty cool if you show up to
LTX because then i'll see you and that
would be pretty neat
LTX hat is a meet-up and interactive
tech event the interactive honestly the
meat apart is is hopefully cool you get
to meet all of us here at linus media
group which might sound weird because
i'm not whatever don't worry but you get
to meet everyone from linus media group
plus me and the really cool part though
and the reason in my opinion why you
should go is because it is a interactive
tech event it's not just a convention
where you get to go see a couple booths
and you maybe take a picture with
someone and you bail there are actors to
go things you love
yeah izing like i like i'm not even
kidding we're trying to oversell this at
all i had so much fun last year it was
very very enjoyable as well and like it
was so cool that rod and bob were there
and showing people how to do hard line
water cooling bends with actual tubes
you got to sit there with
heat gun and make a to bend with
hardline water tubing which takes some
of the fear out of it this year we're
gonna be living deleting a CPUs that is
sick
where else can you just try to learn
that from people that really know what
they're talking I don't know LTX is a
really cool event if you want to check
it out you absolutely should it is held
on July 14th at the Richmond Olympic
Oval in Richmond BC I know it's in
Canada I'm sorry try to get here if you
can the good news is you don't have to
know how to skate that's true unlike in
2010 when they had the Olympics there
and just be skating yeah that icing or
so you can you can just walk in you
don't have to skate in you know
completely fine completely current
booths include a blind cable management
competition brought to you by cable mod
ad lidding workshop so you can bring
your CPUs and we'll show you how to deal
it it a cable toss or sorry case tossed
2.0 which is the girl that was a good
idea that it got updated multi-headed vr
so you can go up against each other in
VR which is cool a LAN like that's gonna
have like an actual Lantern yeah yeah a
12k ultra wide gaming setup would that's
like 4k but times three h3 and more
there will be more on top of that
there's gonna be food is gonna be meat
music is gonna be music probably okay
horse coltan I wonder it like is it live
is it car we just gonna play music over
speakers um please direct all inquiries
up twitter at colton underscore potter
that ask him everything then we cool
systems to look at for sure more room
more games more swag than last year the
fact that we have more swag is insane
because every single person left with at
least one thing last year there's
special guests
there's exclusive live unboxings just
like last lines will probably drop
something probably yeah and more which
includes the line is dropping something
come hang out take a start at $35
canadian that's really not that much
money it really is almost 35 canadian if
you're american or from the EU you
probably have that much in like whatever
your currency is just in your couch
cushions right so and you can check it
says them out but what that's weird
it's you can check the link out in the
links below or on screen if you're
watching on twitch over there LTX expo
comm it's it's super hard to get to
then that brings us to the floodplain
well I don't know if I heard we had a
very very very illuminating episode of
tech quickie out on float playing today
oh very illuminating what one is it chai
tell them or originally already really
plug this one yeah oh that's pretty
interest isn't it though see if this guy
says it's interesting he's been doing
this longer than I have so that's
actually I yeah I don't know yeah and I
want to know so we're gonna we're gonna
show my screen so it doesn't seem insane
but there's a tech kooky episode on the
fastest possible internet how fast can
you actually go yeah how fast can you
download gotta go fast questionable
videos yeah very much that's a question
there's there's AMD's 32 core fu to
Intel Wow for a second I thought you're
gonna read out a model number the sort
of with fu portable professional
workstation with three displays that
thing is actually insane and a pumpless
liquid cooler from der bauer which
that's another video both these videos
at the top I'm super interested in
checking out anytime your Bower does
anything
it's amazing sound very like German and
intense you know well yeah it is
engineering also there is bit wit ultra
on here and tech deals I'm not going to
show you there guys as their stuff
because I don't know if I'm like really
necessarily even allowed to but if
you're a fan of tech deals or if you're
a fan of Kyle at bit wit check out their
channels as well their stuff comes on
here a week early everyone's using the
same model right now full plane does not
make people use this exact model but
everyone has done the exact same thing
which is fine but it's three bucks per
channel so far every single person has
gone with three dollars and you get
their content a week early the comments
section is awesome because there's way
less cancer than on YouTube
way less it's like always positive
discussion which is super cool and we
have in terms of features that are
coming soon one of the really cool ones
that people have been asking for a while
is playback speed there's some guys that
apparently watch it like two times or
one-and-a-half times on YouTube I just
gotta get stuff done i I'm guilty of
washing things at one point five that's
on YouTube sometimes that is
that's actually a good feature fully
operational relatively soon
and just the comment section thing on
floatplane you can actually have a
comment score the negative so if so just
post if someone just posts the hottest
of takes they'll get like a minus 50 so
I thought I was on this video but I
don't see it but someone said first and
they're just like no Matt was on mine oh
that was that was on today's tech wiki I
was so funny yeah there are 29 yeah just
slammed so yeah you can do that it's
possible for those of you who watched
already thanks very much shout out to
Portugal you'll know what I'm talking
about if you watched if not you'll see
you next week I don't know to Portugal I
mentioned Portugal very randomly in my
videos I'm definitely yes so so thank
you to all of our fans in Porto in
Lisbon in the Azores wherever you may be
in Portugal good luck in the World Cup
so heck yeah right okay moving on to
back to news topics Thank You atlas Rafe
for posting this on the forum AMD
unveils 7 nanometre GPU at Computex
super cool let me just get this stuff if
you want to start I'm gonna get this
stuff in twitch ad and sure up on the
screen ok um also at Computex big
surprise there right AMD announced the
first seven nanometer GPU launching in
the second half of 2018 it's a big deal
because intel has Intel hasn't even
gotten to ten yet and AMD is already
announcing hey we're going to have a 7
nanometre GPU oh this is a GPU so to be
pretty until they makes it so um what
does Invidia have right now do they have
or they on 10 yet I immediately have
forgotten yeah I'm sure twitch has
screaming at me for that Intel gaff by
the way cuz we're talking about GPUs but
that's ok see they've been on 10 for a
while Oh have they ok why am i blanking
I shouldn't be yeah I just love having
dead air oh it's great it's so great
it's I mean it's um oh no no yes yeah
Pascal so Pascal is what 14 16 14 16 to
14 okay so there you go so yes so we're
they're basically having that AMD is
having that with Vega so Andy will have
Vega on seven nanometers inside the new
Radeon instinct part they're claiming 25
persecutes me 35 percent more
performance over the previous gen 14
nanometer part so there so you're having
it is what they were winning yeah I
remember there was a split and I was
trying to think of what numbers that
split on but okay 14 nanometer is 1030
1050 so the lower in silicon is 14 and
then for the higher end chips are we
using 16 yes oh yeah okay yeah I see
yeah 16 so so there you go so envious
latest offerings are either 14 or 16
depending on what you get Andy is going
down to 7 twice a power efficiency so
which kind of makes sense right because
it's 2 times the density of their last
gen which was 14 so this now means Andy
is a head of the GPU game in this one
area because even Volta is videos new
urgent architecture is at 12 nanometers
right now so but do note that there
actually isn't an industry-standard way
to measure transistor sizes so um you're
it I think it used to mean a little bit
more than it does now so do take that
number with a small grain of salt but
it's still a pretty big deal also
remember that it's I believe it's square
nanometers so 7 is like mm-hmm
considerably smaller than 10 right yeah
yeah it's just like how 4 square inches
is a lot smaller than yeah yeah okay
just a thing to remember there you go
someone in the twitch chat reminded me
of that so thank you to whoever that was
so prepare for high wattage power
supplies being even dumber unless you
have a water chiller from an aquarium
for your computer so yes yes of course
now okay wow what is that often you back
there loud noises so this is another
really really cool piece of news in my
opinion this is posted by Shreyas one
on the forum gigabyte making fake RAM
it's fake
except it's super cool and you want it
to be fake so I'll explain that in a
moment do you know about this I know
about it now so apparently they're
selling their a or this is I pronounce a
resource or a source or RGB LED memory
which is it's not surprising that that's
sort of their like game or line of stuff
now so it's gonna have all the RGB so
two of the sticks are your
run-of-the-mill eight gig ddr4 memory
module yeah but the other half of the
bundle is two sticks of fake RAM they're
made the same aluminum housing but and
they have the LEDs that can sync up with
your actual RAM sticks but they have
none of the memory bits so if you can't
afford to populate every single slot on
your motherboard with actual RAM but you
don't want it to look like there's big
gaps in between your RGB you can get
this instead you can save some money and
have a look like they're all populated
until you can afford more actual ram now
I don't personally care at all because
I've never cared about fully populating
so I don't think it looks bad but I am
100% certain because I know them that
there are people that do care about
fully populating all their slots yeah
and RAM is incredibly expensive right
now so the fact that they are able to
bridge that gap a little bit you can
fill all the slots but you don't have to
spend ludicrous amounts of money well
there's a certain effect you get you
know because when you have a little
slots populated if the light bars like
on top or are th ICC thick enough then
you will have an effect that looks like
a big block or a big brick instead of
like little strips of color or so yeah
that's so I don't mind the strips of
color thing but yeah I just understand
how people like that aesthetic and it
still gets you the the sticks of RAM
that actually have memory on them in
this kit that we're talking about here
is 8 gig dims each so you're getting 16
total gigs of ram which is pretty solid
yeah so so the modules the fake modules
can still communicate with the other
ones they just don't have any actual RAM
on them but so do note if you're
interested in this right now you have to
buy as a whole kit but gigabyte is
considering the possibility of just
selling the fake stick separately at
point so I think they'll do that based
on what and say we did
so he has no idea no hey there we go
they'll probably end up selling them
individually if these kits sell well
enough yeah mix it's it's probably like
a manufacturing worthiness situation I
could see it happening cuz I'm sure
there's plenty of people who have bought
ran they didn't need just so they could
populate all their slots so I'm sure
this hat again I'd I know people that
have done that they're a guy even know
people that have bought the same looking
kit just lower capacity for the second
set we got it like I don't even need
more RAM yeah oh man okay and then you
get into this whole like catch-22 where
even if you don't need more like oh let
me just buy like a one gig stick of this
thing but it's higher and Randa has the
RER GB so you can't yeah yeah so this
one moving on this was posted by sc2
Mitch on the forum just like every week
dude thank you very much for posting the
the source of this article is
motherboard vice.com
as many of you have probably heard
github is being purchased by Microsoft
now github and get lab or different
things I'm just putting that out here
for people that may not know so get for
that for the context of this story get
lab is not being purchased by Microsoft
github is being purchased by Microsoft
this thirteen thousand projects ditched
github forget lab Monday morning thing
is a little out-of-date the current
number that we have is I believe a
hundred and fifty thousand of them have
ditched github forget lab now more
projects have bailed off of github in
that time these are just the ones that
have gone to get lab specific yeah there
are other solutions but that that's the
the majority of the movers have done
that now to put to rest a little bit of
the freaked out from the information
that i've been able to see online and
some of the stuff that's in this exact
article it seems like most people are
bailing because they're making like
Spock's emulators well here's I'm gonna
like things that Microsoft that are
going against Microsoft specifically
well there's okay obviously something
like an emulator you can see the
problems there with like IP and
copyright infringement but but okay so
just one example I can think of that has
some pretty recent relevance if you go
on YouTube shameless plug for tech wiki
we did a recent Technica sewed on dns
league leaks and how they can undermine
your privacy and how they can expose
your browsing history even if you're
using a VPN so let's say you're using a
VPN that has a DNS leak protection
feature on it yeah um so there is a
feature in Windows 8 and in Windows 10
it has a really long acronym I can't
exactly remember what it is rum SM H&amp;amp;R I
think as well as called but it is a
feature and there's a reason I'm doing
the quotation fingers that can't
apparently even override DNS leak
protection and compromise your privacy
yeah so there was someone on github that
wrote a patch for Open VPN where you
could just download it and it would like
take care of that for you when Microsoft
consider something like that undermining
their own software if they don't want
people doing that you know cuz I mean
copyright infringement one thing is
super obvious but what if it's like
there's an actual problem with a
Microsoft product like Windows that
someone is in good faith trying to fix
for people and Microsoft just says no
and people wouldn't know where to look
because so many people just kind of
automatically go to github and think the
stuff is going to be on there so yeah
it's gonna be interesting and also I
forgot to post the YouTube announcement
so rip and there's like not even that
much time left in the show but I just
published it so people will be able to
see for watch alas how long we have oh
no so anyways it's it's it's yeah people
even thinking projects that could easily
be used to harm others like deep fakes
might be a problem and a lot of those
types of projects have bailed already
okay which sucks because deep fakes can
also be used to not hurt people
yeah just like a power drill yeah
pretty much so like we'll have to see
how Microsoft deals with this trying to
connect you are offline oh great but but
yeah I just I don't think it's gonna be
as nuclear as people think I suspect
Microsoft isn't gonna do a ton different
with it than was already being done with
github hopefully everything doesn't
become weird colored squares because I
really have no good lord usually does
not enjoy it kind of depends I mean I
think there were fears about that with
something like uwp for example mm-hmm
but at the same time you know the
desktop experience on Windows 10 is
still like largely Oh open what ever
since you were garbage garbage I hate
the desktop experience on Windows 10 oh
no I'm not talking about UI UI is
different than whether the platform is
open or closed okay yeah yeah UI is a
totally different story like you can
hate the UI you all you want to but um
that is a preference thing I know some
people are gonna screech I don't person
you want to do this thing here or this
thing is better either one sure I don't
know what ton of it is cool I don't know
what ton about it but let's let's dive
into it see what we can get so thank you
Club 3d who you be 3d who you be cub
cute oh I think it's cute oh of course
it's it's just a very tortured spelling
of cube I failed that one it is cubed
for suresies all right you've steak
forbes is the source article here and
there's bin so once it loads my internet
is a not the happiest at the moment but
there's been some leaks of the pixel
three now one interesting thing here is
that there's going to be three phones
there's gonna be the standard normal
pixel there's gonna be the pixel XL
those are already expected now there's
going to be a mid-range phone and they
don't mean sighs they don't mean between
the normal sized pix they're talking on
pix power yeah I mean power and price
and stuff like that what is going on
don't care about your court of the day
load the webpage please it's hard to fly
without ruffling a few feathers I'm
trying to ruffle your feathers Forbes
let me fly please hello okay
oh my goodness awesome alright well the
cool part is that there's three phones
there's the affordable pixel 3 which is
the interesting one in this lineup not
not because the other ones aren't
interesting but because it's new so the
affordable pixel 3 which is what we're
gonna call it a sort of mid-range just
so we don't get confused by the sizing
things it is a likely going to be a
game-changer for mid-range smartphone
photography and that kind of makes sense
because a lot of the awesomeness of the
pixel camera is in the software then
they can put that software on the cheap
phone which is really cool
the 3xl is going to have a knotch how do
you feel about this yeah that's
happening so I'm gonna I'm will have to
see but I'm almost certainly gonna be
getting a pixel 3 ok I currently still
have my pixel 1 XL and I like this phone
a lot but it's starting to show the
signs of being tired the battery
starting yeah there's like it started
yeah you can tell I can't I can't
anymore it's it's still a very good
phone if I wasn't a ridiculous power
user of my phone I wouldn't care that
much but I am a absolute ridiculous
power user oh we have a power user oh
yeah I'm always on this thing and I do a
lot of stuff on it so I'm stoked and I
will probably get the XL ok because I
have large hands I can hide my whole
phone so oh look a power user with his
large hands yeah dude
so the small phones are just a little
too small not quite this is a 6p so yeah
that's a pretty single so I want the XL
that means I have to do with the nagy
traditionally I haven't really liked
notches but it might work if the notch
is small enough which I can't see
because forms won't load I saw some I
saw some allegedly leaked images of the
thing it does look a fair bit smaller
than the iPhone 10 the notch does what
makes sense right guys on Android how it
does notifications it fills them in from
the sides right but on iPhone that
doesn't happen do your notifications are
just in that little tray so if it is
just a fairly small one mm-hmm
that's cool I'm down mm-hmm it also has
front-facing speakers which I can't show
you because they won't load by the way I
don't think this is Forbes his fault
Jessica's anyone the audience is like
what the heck I was making jokes about
not the other fly because of the Forbes
thing whatever I think it our Internet's
being super weird at the end that's
because I had this problem earlier but
yeah okay so I don't know that's super
cool I can't show you what small one
looks like I can't show you what the
mid-range one looks like it apparently
the the the mid-range phone is to be
based on Qualcomm new Snapdragon 710
chipset which promises performance close
to 20 Seventeen's flagship Snapdragon
835 did yeah I think that would be cool
because one big issue that people had
with pixel phones when they started
being called pixel was that they were a
lot more expensive than people wanted so
being able to give a more affordable
option is cool let's definitely minim
maybe it'll stick maybe it'll be it'll
go the way the iPhone 5c who knows yeah
yeah
Australian gamers are being blamed for
slow internet Wow
okay apparently this was slightly taken
out of context this is from ABC oh you
may be this will load maybe not I'm
gonna post this in twitch chat and if
you're watching on YouTube there are
either timestamps posted in the
description of this video or I have
noticed many wonderful people also post
their own custom timestamps below the
video in the comments wow this looks
like it's not properly loading but it's
sort of working so let's show that
screen why not I really like how the
image they used for this story is a
screen cap from Big Bang like what they
don't what the heck that is them what
are they doing is this like a wretch
addition I don't watch this show I don't
know it's always been kind of weird to
me but anyways moving on believe it or
not some of the biggest online games use
very little data when you're playing
compared to streaming HD video or even
high fidelity audio so people are
slamming back at whoever the heck said
this I don't care it doesn't matter
because he's like gamers aren't but
apparently the within the context that
he was saying it so someone named Mauro
I don't know said it's gamers product
predominantly on fixed wireless
apparently what he meant is it's that
he's typecasting gamers not saying that
games right because later on he said
that the people who game or also they
they tend to like consume more data just
across the board whether it's video or
others they're watching twitch streams
they're watching YouTube they're there
streaming audio how they play their game
there these are power users of the
internet because people asked he he
originally said extreme users and then
he was asked to clarify on that so he
said it's gamers predominantly on fixed
wireless but I don't think he meant it
is video games that are the problem I
think he was saying like Matt's gamers
which I also think is not necessarily
true because out of all people that I
know that watch ludicrous amounts of
streaming video it's not necessarily
gaming no I mean you have you have
people that think oh like video games
are stupid but they'll sit there and
they'll binge Netflix like eight hours
at a time and that takes more bandwidth
so yeah it's not that's not the best
look for him at least to be filming home
no cracking a bottle of wine yeah and
chugging it while binging multiple
seasons at a time of your favorite show
of yeah well that is whatever on people
who don't game watch so I don't I'm not
very up on this hip alcoholic
terminology so sorry if I said that
wrong but yes wine yeah yeah didn't call
it wine anymore
I don't know man though I said crack in
a bottle of wine that I realize you
don't do that you you unquote you do the
thing then you crack a bottle of beer
I'm a hip man I'm in with the boys now
it's time for you do the Macarena
hip I'm with it but yeah I I don't know
I I think it's just something taking out
of context I don't think it's actually
when people are freaking out about
people just like screaming I think the
guys just saying its power users it's
people that use the internet alone it's
it's this stuff yeah
if he actually thinks it's video games
he now for sure knows that it's not
because everyone on the planet has told
them you're wrong so I think he gets it
now and we can probably hopefully move
on but I thought it was an interesting
story anyways and something to bring up
Australia's Internet is actually garbage
and one thing that I am very
aggressively against is that apparently
they've been considering throttling back
data consumption of extreme users during
peak periods that's ridiculous Australia
just fix your freaking internet it's not
that hard everyone else has seemed to
figure this out
might be a cost issue they are in an
unfortunate place yeah for undersea
cables figure it out I don't know what
else to say Australia's Internet has
been garbage for a very long time
working at floatplane it's super
expensive to get bandwidth there mm-hmm
I'm trying to serve people in Australia
videos and it's art it's gotta be a cost
issue cuz of me I mean how many how many
times have you had people coming on the
forum saying oh like this GPU costs
almost twice as much in Australia
because reasons so I imagine it might be
similar here I just Australia's Internet
is just garbage I know quite a few
people from Australia and it's it's
really really expensive and it's really
really bad and it's a shame because I
don't think it needs to be I understand
that there's definitely cost
implications but there are countries not
that far away that have really really
bad they're the stadium nachos of the
internet yeah okay yeah Australia yeah
you have the stadium nachos of Internet
I like that analogy and you know we all
understand like people like that fake
cheese sauce it tastes like plastic well
people like that stuff it's disgusting
even bother yes yeah bad no just like
order a hot dog or something like just
or do what I did and smuggle in for
spicy chickens from Wendy's into
movie that's a great I and trade them
for other things bartering my help my
spice I hope no one from Cineplex is
watching this it doesn't let me back
into a movie boy I get it done also
organic carbon module modules organic
carbon molecules found on Mars NASA's
Mars rover Curiosity has identified a
variety of organic molecules the
carbon-based building blocks of life as
we know it in 3.5 billion year old rocks
on Mars this does not give us any
evidence of life necessarily but there's
a possibility that the organics are a
form of an ancient life source of some
kind
we just don't know another finding that
methane concentrations in Mars
atmosphere cycle seasonally the
discovery suggests that the gas is
seeping out from underground reservoirs
it is possible that some of the methane
was produced by organisms as it is here
on earth be very careful that everything
in his in this has possible written all
over it it's not not necessarily
guaranteed they did find organic carbon
molecules and methane concentrations in
ours Mars atmosphere do cycle around
seasonally we got that the rest of it is
all hypotheticals Boston what are
exactly what organics they found because
obviously you know just because it has a
carbon atom and it doesn't mean it you
know came from life you know I see but a
lot of people don't know that which is
why we got a got a really high yeah lot
possible like methane is an extremely
simple molecule look at for them without
life around very easily so yeah
I was trying going through the story to
see if there were any more deets but it
didn't say don't think too many but but
yeah I think that's honestly about it
the rest of the stuff in the doc is not
crazy interesting there's the amazon
thing we can go over that real quick but
oh it doesn't have anything to do with
tech so i don't really know what it does
i think it does it the fact that they
says what is that that is amazon and i
yeah i just store like it's it's an aunt
I don't know why we always end up
talking about Amazon the the fact that
it was online made it a federal crime
okay but online shopping yeah he's all
as heck and Amazon is just like taking
over the whole planet it's like they're
like political level instead of like
basically hacked news but whatever we'll
talk about it Amazon return policy
abusers were sentenced to nearly six
years in prison
basically they bought a wack ton of
GoPros and other stuff so for two years
the fin ends not sure what that means
I'm assuming that's the same yeah
they're a Mary they're a married couple
yeah okay they ordered over 2,700
electronic items from Amazon including
GoPro digital cameras Xboxes
smartwatches tablets laptops and then
they reported them as damaged and that
somehow didn't get flagged el automatic
they used a lot of like shell accounts
and stuff so they did it from like a
bunch of different accounts to try to
avoid detection good job VPNs I'm
assuming once Amazon replaced the
products they would sell them to a third
person de Nigel glue Mac I'd probably
die though I don't know it doesn't
matter
the annual glue Mac but currently it's
da ni je L which is a pretty cool name
yeah that's if that is I'm sure it's
just Daniel but if that is his name that
name is sick hell no that is a screen I
should get a dog in a mad dog shell dog
 in all Aaron and Leah fin'in are
said to have made approximately 750
thousand dollars running the scam while
glumack made approximately five hundred
thousand dollars so um the the couple
that got nearly six years each the
accomplice got two years 24 months um so
I thought this was interesting because
just from from a legal perspective legal
corner with John real quick real quick
here they they were prosecuted federally
ok because it was done across state
lines and the feds are pretty serious
about like winning cases against people
like if like like I think the feds have
like an over ninety percent conviction
rate when they bring charges against
people and if you go to federal prison I
think the rule is you have to serve 85%
of your sins before you are eligible for
parole so they're not they're not
getting out for a little while yeah so
apparently this wasn't the only thing
that happened I again I don't know why
Amazon means that we're talking about it
but the Amazon fraud wasn't the only
problem
they also bounced checks they rented
cars and failed to pay for them they
sold other stolen high-end yours
yeah and they withheld rent all of which
are actions that were taken into account
during the sentencing none of which mean
that it makes sense being on the land
show I joined that note I just realized
I'm responsible for having this on here
I'm sorry I just don't I just I just
don't now I feel bad anyways thanks for
watching
I think it's time for a morale meeting
next week like we need to have a
company-wide dialogue oh how we like
treat the contributions of our fellow I
think it's high time for this I just we
always talk about Amazon stuff and
sometimes they do tech related things
but not always thank you very much
squeeze Alexa thank you for c like that
accent thank you very much l TX so us

where you can walk in and walk out and
you just get your stuff I think that's
cool that's Texaco yeah I detect we're
gonna Amazon girl was good yes always
