interesting new product that i actually
got as a sample this is a special ops
kit of memory ok so this is a you know I
don't even know why I'm unboxing this
but basically I just want to check out
this cool camouflage memory and I made
me think of the unboxing that I did
yesterday on the asus sabertooth tough
series motherboard that also had like an
army theme to it so i am going to open
this up and we're going to have a close
look at these ram spreaders so this is
an ocz product and they have any number
of different colors of ram spreaders
that you can get on there r and you can
get like green sli ones or red cross
fire already ones or gold ones or
platinum ones or whatever else so you
can see on the on the inside this is
just their standard gold XTC memory
cover and then on the outside you've got
like the camouflage special ops Ram
spreader cover sticker thing I actually
peeled one of these off on a ok wait
wait wait I'll get the camera person to
look at the round while I walk over
there for a second yes there it is i
found it ok so here's an ocz stick of
ram that i actually peeled that top
layer off of so that's what it looks
like anyway thank you for checking out
my video blog on unboxing the ocz
special ops ram</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
