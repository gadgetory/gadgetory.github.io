CES 2016 this year check out the link in
the video description down below alright
guys welcome to gigabyte they have a new
graphics card I know it's an IHC I don't
worry about it just keep watching it's
fine I'll explain why in a moment this
is their new extreme gaming line of
graphics cards it's one step above their
g1 gaming line this one specifically is
a GV n 9 ATT extreme6 GD which is a 6
gigabyte nati it boosts to 13 17
megahertz but if you guys have seen any
of my videos on GPU boost that know that
me you know that means relatively
nothing it'll be probably somewhere
above there hopefully we'll see try one
out let me know what you think anyways
the main interesting thing about this is
that it has an extended cooler in both
length and height it's six heat pipes
whatever but there's also angel eyes now
what the hell are angel eyes they're LED
illuminated rings that are around each
one of the fans that are are to be
controllable this one here has a weird
dial on it that allows me to change it
yours will not be changed that way
because this is like a weird custom rig
thing don't worry about it it's fine
anyways RGB LED rings around each one of
the fans that looks super cool other
than that yeah I'm not gonna spend a ton
of time on it because the main reason
why this is interesting is this platform
the angel eyes the extended cooler the
the 6 pin power that you can add on for
extra overclocking that is not required
to run the car that's on the end of the
car to the ln2 button and all like kind
of fun stuff is going to be coming to
pascal when they release those cars with
its gtx 1080 or whatever it is they'll
be coming then so stay tuned for that
check out their extreme gaming line
maybe later on or if you're in the
market for 980 TI now maybe that's
applicable to you next up if you're a
fan of Thunderbolt you might be a fan of
the Gaz 170 xud 5 th why you might ask
well Thunderbolt 3 support speeds of up
to 40 gigabit per second which is pretty
sick and this board has support for it
over two different USB type-c connectors
so you can have two different daisy
chain setups of Thunderbolt devices on
one motherboard and this is officially
supported by Intel you can see on their
little card thingy that they have here
that has Intel logos on it so yeah
that's absolutely kind of cool if you're
into Thunderbolt aesthetically it's
black and gold with some heat sinks that
have black with gold accented on it in
terms of i/o on the back you've got two
USB 2.0 one ps2 port
you've got four USB 3.0 those are split
across two banks and then your two
type-c connector is that support USB
type-c which are again under those USB
to point out ports and HDMI out a
Gigabit Ethernet with two more USB 2.0
ports under it and then a bank of audio
connectors as well boom we're back over
here I don't know why don't worry about
it Squarespace build it beautiful or
maybe build a website about teleporting
you might add theories as to that you
can have a custom designed to make your
website about teleporting look really
nice it'll look beautiful if you want to
sell teleportation devices I don't know
about the legality of that but you would
be able to do that through their
commerce module which is pretty cool if
you had any problems with that because
you spend all your time researching
teleportation devices instead of
building websites you can use their live
chat support or email support both of
which are 24 7 which is pretty cool if
you buy your website domain for a year
which I don't know if is that applicable
if you have a teleportation device that
you need to buy a website for a year but
regardless you get a domain for free
which is also pretty cool anyways
Squarespace build it beautiful stay
subscribed Alliance exits for all our
CES 2016 content I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
