check the link in the video description
for more details maybe it's being
presumptuous of me but I'm pretty sure
that this is a hotly anticipated
unboxing from me the Razer hammerhead
pro ok so what are they calling this
mm-hmm expert analog gaming and music in
ear headset so the difference between
the hammerhead Pro and the regular
hammer head is very simple it's a
microphone so the regular hammerhead is
exactly the same product except no
inline microphone and no call control
alright what else do they have to say
about this themselves right on razors
website it says ahem hammering the base
it's called the hammer head this is made
for bass heads so it should be noted
right out of the bat right out of the
gate that just because I don't
particularly like the sound signature
shouldn't take away from the fact that
you may enjoy the sound signature of
this headset if you enjoy a ton of bass
I personally prefer a more balanced
sound where there's a good mix of high
mids and lows but some people just want
to hear it pound whether it's explosions
or whether it's you know just heavy bass
tracks or whatever else the case may be
music movies games you want to hear it
go so there we go what's included you
get the picture of your new headphones
slash headset as well as a letter
alright that's cool you get a Quick
Start Guide although quite frankly if
you need a Quick Start Guide for
headphone stand it should probably come
with a guide for how to tie your shoes
and then next up we've got the actual
headphones themselves so there's a hard
carrying case I personally don't really
find myself using these too much I do
prefer to just kind of chuck my
headphones in my pocket because I'm lazy
like that but some people do use them
that it's nice to have a little spot
here where you can put some of the
accessories and keep them separate from
the headphones themselves so you don't
risk losing them speaking of accessories
this accessory right here is an audio
splitter I like seeing this
included with headphones I particularly
like seeing a nice high-quality one so
there that is machined aluminum and then
it has like a nice a nice knurled finish
on both of the ends here so that you can
really grab on to it and then you've got
a bright green wire running to the
headphone and microphone jacks which are
both clearly labeled as well as having
color-coded bands on them next up we've
got the headphones themselves so I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to pull
those out and put them aside for now
razor so good at packaging look how
nicely presented all this is I love that
although some of their older packaging
used to be a little bit better than some
of their newer stuff they used to you
could tell you just looked at it you
went wow they spent a ton on this
package in these days there they're
moving away from that a little bit and
they're giving in and using plastic here
and there which isn't necessarily a bad
thing you know
seeing companies spend more on the
product itself and then finding creative
ways to make the packaging look good
without without overspending on it it's
definitely definitely positive so you
get three different sizes of standard
silicon ear tips so you get a large
medium and small this is pretty standard
these days with most everyone including
at least three different sizes I'd love
to see you know it's kind of like the
race to higher dpi on mice or the race
to any number of different things on my
side love to see the race two more ear
tip inclusions so it's like well you
guys are gonna have three well I'm gonna
have seven different sizes of ear tips
included so everyone from like Andre the
Giant down to my son who's 15 months old
will be able to have the optimal fit
actually it's not even necessarily a bad
idea razor if you're watching this let's
see the hammerhead elite with like 16
different ear tips sizes because that's
my wife's biggest complaint about IMS is
that none of them really fit oh right so
there you go
speaking of ear tips that fit correctly
let's go ahead and check this out so it
uses nine-millimeter neodymium drivers
so you can actually see those if you go
ahead and remove the ear tip and then
they include a fourth year tech tip so
this is a an optional buy flange so Rays
are saying this provides superior fit
noise isolation and bass responds by
giving you two two layers
here so see there's two basically two
standard silicon ear tips in one so that
I don't know let's find out five phones
you know what they're a little bit big
for me I do tend to wear the smallest
size that's included with whatever
earbuds that that I do use so I'm going
to go ahead and put the small ones on
maybe we can get a little bit of a sort
of model shot so you can hopefully see
the earphones themselves if not we'll do
an overlay so they're using the same
machined aluminum construction a very
striking green look to them overall
arrays are so good at product aesthetics
I find that with the by flange it
doesn't go quite as far into my ear
canal as it does with the single small
ear tip so I would probably end up using
the small ones but if you were going to
use a medium-sized one anyway give the
lifeline to try because it it might end
up being a better experience for you so
in line controls you only find this on
the pro version so there is a single
omnidirectional microphone right here as
well as a single button for answering
calls and voice control and all those
things that you'll expect to do on your
Android or iOS device so when I first
fired them up I had a ballad on my phone
that was playing and I got a say the
mids and highs they're quite lacking
compared to the bass when they said
hammering the bass that's what they
meant made for bass heads whether you
appreciate bass in your music movies or
games you will appreciate the bass here
the overall impressions that they leave
me with are that compared to most
fashion headphones that you'd find in
that $50 price range where they're all
show and no go the razor's have as much
show as those headphones especially with
the machined aluminum fittings whether
they're down here whether they're the
housings of the ear tips themselves or
whether it's even the things like the
adapters or the inline microphone
without being too heavy because they
have used aluminum it's a it's a great
overall balance so they have the show
and they've have more go than I'd say
most headphones do in that sort of
product category where you go to the
local Future Shop or Best Buy and you're
kind of like show me headphones and they
started around $30 to $50 you get kind
of stuff that really isn't very good I
would definitely recommend
and these over that I want to do a quick
microphone test here so we're just going
to play back a quick audio clip for you
guys and I think that pretty much wraps
it up so here we go recording so thank
you for checking out this unboxing and
first look at the Razer hammerhead don't

computer videos click that like button
on the video if you enjoyed it and don't
forget to leave a comment let me know do
you prefer a more balanced town stage or
do you prefer just rocking it out and
having as much bass as you can possibly
have thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
