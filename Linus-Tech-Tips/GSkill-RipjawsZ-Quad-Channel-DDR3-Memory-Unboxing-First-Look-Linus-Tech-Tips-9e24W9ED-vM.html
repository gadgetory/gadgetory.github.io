hopefully since this is a very simple
one I can get my little boy to help me
with it yeah there you go
that's some delicious computer memory so
today we're going to be having a look at
the g.skill ripjaws z memory so these
are quad channel kits with a pretty
sweet heat spreader good color scheme
all that good stuff as well as some
pretty aggressive specs so the kid I
have here looks like a dual-channel kit
because there's only two sticks there
but what actually happens is when you
can I can I borrow this for a sec sir
okay okay okay well okay okay okay no no
okay that's probably sharp I don't know
if you want us to do that there you go
when you flip it over you can see
there's two more memory sticks at the
back now these are an 1866 c9 kit 32
gigs so that's for 8 gig dims which
means that you can actually fund them
which is crazy
ddr3 1866 12 16 gigs 1.5 volt and you
can run two of these kits although you
won't necessarily get those speeds so
this is one of the faster 8 gig DIMM
kits out there because generally
speaking the more the more capacity you
add to the kit and particularly the more
dims you add to the kit the more
difficult it is to bend for higher speed
so ultimate quad channel memory for
intel x79 systems it should be noted
that there's nothing that would prevent
you from running a quad channel memory
kit in dual channel on a dual channel
board so two sets of dual channel sticks
on something like a z77 or an AMD board
and now I've got everyone joining me for
this unboxing we're never gonna get a
chance to look at the memory at all
comes with a lifetime warranty from
g.skill so you can go ahead and check
out the heat spreader here they're using
a matte black PCB which looks stunning
as always I love the matte black PCB and
then in terms of the heat spreader it's
your pretty standard not too high but
definitely not low profile either so if
you have a really sort of low clearing
CPU cooling you might have some trouble
with it but otherwise it should be fine
and I think that pretty much covers it
they are XMP ready so it's just a matter
of dialing in the XMP profile if you
want to get them running at the right
speed and as you can see the package
is delicious so Merry Christmas and all
that and thank you for checking out this
unboxing of g.skill ripjaws II memory
that I was joined for by all of my
guests here I'm a baby and my rumble cat
