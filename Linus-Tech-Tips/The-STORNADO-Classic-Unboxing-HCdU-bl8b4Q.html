yeah just just just do it again I am
actually really excited about this video
because on the one hand it's some really
cool server gear from our buds over at
Seagate and 45 drives but on the other
hand it's a project that has kind of a
personal element to it for me so if you
guys are in tune with sort of the rest
of the tech youtuber community you might
know that we actually hooked up some of
our buds with storage servers over the
last little while and I was a little bit
I was a little bit surprised to find out
that some of those folks have actually
changed out their storage servers or
added storage servers without checking
in with me again for a variety of
reasons and I'm gonna have a more
detailed video following this up in the
future we'll talk about those reasons
we'll actually maybe get an opportunity
to talk to them directly about what
exactly happened but the bottom line is
the observation was that an unread box
full of magnetic hard drives was not
really suitable for editing off of
because it wasn't fast enough but that's
something that I definitely know and if
I'd known that people wanted a high
performance solution I could have helped
them out
it's just that they went with another
solution that I kind of looked at and
went well gee that doesn't on paper make
a ton of sense so today's video is about
exploring what else is out there for
editors who are looking for a high
performance network based storage
solution and whether compared to some of
the more booty key options we think we
can DIY something a little more exciting
and today's video is brought to you by
Ridge wallet with a ridge wallet you
don't have to carry around any of those
well so so much so you don't have to
it's that it incentivizes you do not
carry around stupid things like gift
cards
a dollar 27 left on them our old hotel
room keys or whatever else cuz they just
don't have space for them check them out
at the link in the video description and
you can get 50 per excuse me 50 15
percent off we'll have that down below
alright so guys here's our target this
is the luma forage jellyfish can you see
my screen okay David it's not not too
bad okay so this is a you can actually
get it in a variety of configurations
mobile tower or rack with the tower and
the rack from my understanding being
very similar I have actually spoken with
these folks although they're not talking
to me anymore now that they know that
I'm trying to beat their product for the
same price or less so all I can go based
on is what they told me before they
figured out my ulterior motive so let's
go ahead and choose their tower because
the tower is quieter so you can see here
their pricing is $29,000 995 and that
gets you 80 terabytes of raw storage
with 53 terabytes
available so the reason that you've got
less available then you have raw storage
is because they're using ZFS with like a
raid Z okay don't quote me on this I
believe it's a raid z22 raid Z 2 s and
then I believe the two are stripes
together which is kind of like a raid 60
don't quote me on that I'm gonna have to
check my notes and make sure that it's
alright when I do the follow up video so
I kind of went wow 80 terabytes for 30
grand that's got to be some pretty
that's got to be some pretty amazing
like lightning fast you know storage
nests and stuff except there's only one
small problem that 80 terabyte
configuration 80 terabytes of raw
storage configuration is actually using
mechanical drives mechanical drives my
friends so a quick search over on
newegg.com would reveal that the storage
in this machine
let's choose 10 terabyte
drives for a nice round number 10
terabyte hard drive hmm so eight of
those would be let's let's pick
something let's go straight for the
enterprise so eight times $300 is twenty
four hundred dollars what happened to my
other you know twenty seven thousand
bucks here I don't know so what I could
have done was I could have put together
a project where I build something
comparable for the same for a lower
price but then I thought how completely
out of whack they were on their pricing
and I thought you know what I think we
can do better so this is this is the
project that I'm introducing today the
all solid-state storage
looma Forge jellyfish killer yes my
friends for the price of the one hundred
and twenty terabyte jellyfish we're
going to attempt to build a completely
SSD based server that absolutely smashes
the doors off of the jellyfish so you
know we have there's no guarantee that
this is actually all gonna work out that
way but I'm feeling so to start with we
need to unbox something from 45 drives
that I've actually never had occasion to
use before so I haven't experienced
firsthand this is called a 45 drives
tornado it's an actually it's actually a
relatively recent product from them and
I thought there wasn't really anything
that's special about it until I started
doing research for what kind of a server
enclosure I could use for this project
and I just couldn't find anything else
that quite fit the bill because the
thing is part of 45 Dru
this is some interesting packing that's
it you guys come on better glue 45
drives so part of 45 drives a stick is
that instead of relying on back planes
which take your SATA or your nvme or
your or your SAS connection and then
divide it up to multiple drives they
directly attach every single Drive in
their machines to the storage controller
now this has a this has a cost in terms
of the wiring that they have to do
inside their enclosures because they
have to run an individual cable to every
single Drive and it has a cost in terms
of controllers because instead of using
a single eight port controller to run
you know let's say times four is
thirty-two drives or something like that
they actually have to add more SATA or
more SAS controllers to their machines
but they claim the advantage is that
you've reduced the complexity in other
ways you reduce the points of failure by
just using a proper controller port for
every single Drive so anyway because
we're going for maximum performance in
this machine I didn't want to run into
any kind of you know SATA splitter or
SAS splitter bottleneck and I decided to
go with this tornado I was going to use
a machine from Super Micro that's
actually quite similar to one that we
have in our server room but what I
realized is that it only had I believe
about four you know four I believe it
was eight SATA channels for 48 drives or
something along those lines so it just
really wasn't gonna fit the bill for us
so let's oh yeah I sure can
so let's go ahead and crack this open
Anthony do you want to give me that
overhead shot there oh look at our
people enjoying the stream so far they
into this pool because I am amped so it
looks like 45 drives actually sent over
a significantly higher end configuration
than I
dissipated it might have actually kind
of screwed me over on this because I
have like I have a costs I have a cost
target to hit here and they've gone and
they've equipped this thing with a dual
socket motherboard and how much how much
RAM do we have now okay
with that said this might still be okay
because I know that luma Forge does have
a performance boost option where they
install more ran and I believe they
upgrade the CPU but they don't actually
tell you how much more ram or how much
more CPU they put in so it's like we
could kind of say yeah we performance
boosted it and we could go up against
that if we want but either way the math
is gonna be a little bit fuzzy on this
project in terms of RAM they've gone and
equipped us with 32 gigs times 8 so
that's around 256 gigs of ram now you
might wonder why on earth you would need
256 gigs of ram for a storage server and
that's a very fair question but the
reason is that because we're going to be
using ZFS probably on FreeNAS although
that's not entirely decided yet because
we're going to be using ZFS we can
actually use our ram as a cache in a way
that can improve our performance
significantly now normally with FreeNAS
and ZFS what you could do is you could
install an SSD device or two that you
could use to act as sort of like a
buffer for writes so all your random
writes go to your SSD and then it will
kind of organize it all and then spit it
out in a more linear fashion that's more
harddrive friendly but because we're
using all solid-state drives it's very
unlikely that we'd get a great benefit
from that so the only ways to really
successfully cache a fully solid-state
server would be either using obtain or
using RAM and the the consultant
actually this is a really exciting part
of this video the consultant that I have
connected with actually at Computex this
year to help us out on this project and
make sure that we are setting this up in
the best way possible is none other than
oh well I'm having a total
I'm having a total brain abandoning me
moment and I have fashions we forgot
misty oh this is really bad
oh boy
hopefully he never watches this we
Patrick I know he's watching right now
Patrick from served the home so if you
guys aren't familiar with serve the home
it's an absolutely fantastic sight it's
better than it sounds
because it kind of sounds like you know
weird nerds
you know cobbling together like servers
for their closets out of old hardware or
something like that
and they do do that kind of stuff of
course but they're actually they go so
much deeper than that and they have a
really great understanding of network
storage and servers and all that kind of
good stuff so we're gonna work with
Patrick he's gonna come up here for the
final build where we put this whole
thing together get all the little dials
tweaked and see how much performance we
can pull out of this machine so you guys
can see here I've actually gone ahead
and pulled off the second cover here and
that is is that not just absolutely
beautiful I've never seen a store Nadeau
so the difference between a 45 drives
store and a derp and ass tornado is this
this is actually a very similar chassis
to their AV 15 which is the one that we
hooked to Austin up with where you load
a bunch of hard drives in here but
instead they've got this bracket that
seems to be like machined like acetone
like a dollar in type material or
something there's a metal outer layer
and it's designed to hold
yeah it's 32 SSDs up to 32 SSDs let's go
ahead and have a look at the rest of our
specs here so as I said before we're
using dedicated controller ports for
each one of these slots so you can
actually see the absolute nightmare of
cabling if you get a look through there
David can you see that kind of through
that through that slit there all these
cables that are running to each
individual slot and we're using a pair
of I believe they're LSI controllers
here although LSI has been I think
acquired a couple of times in the last
five years so I can't keep track of who
owns them
now is it Broadcom now Anthony I know it
was a vago for a bit whatever I'm just
going to go full old school and I'm
gonna call them LSI controllers because
I just can't be arsed to deal with it
there are 93 90 305 - 16s I think don't
don't quote me on that it's kind of hard
to read from this angle and then here's
another thing that we've gotten here so
this is a pair of Intel X 540 T 2
Ethernet cards now you might wonder why
we would care about having quad 10
Gigabit Ethernet ports on this device
well one of luma forges big selling
points for the jellyfish is that it's
like plug-and-play so you don't need a
switch like a network switch that has to
sit and be powered externally and you've
got wiring from your nas and then wiring
to all your editors it's meant to be
just like a drop and go solution where
your editors just plug right into the
back of it and boom they've got access
to the network share so that's something
that I talked to Patrick about and he's
like yeah I think we can simplify the
setup of that to the point where someone
could build something like this and have
that experience for themselves without
paying an arm and a leg for it or they
could pay an arm for a leg for it and
they could have an all solid-state
server instead of one with spinning rust
now let's have a look at a couple of
customizations that 45 drives has made
so we went for Oh instead of a redundant
power supply because we're looking for a
configuration that's more like the tower
we went for a single quiet power supply
I want this to be something that someone
could install in their office and be
ready to rock with and all of the fans
are Noctua high airflow fans for this
particular configuration so these are
NFS 12a FLX fans all right now let's
talk about oh the thing that made this
project feasible so I actually was
already getting pretty close to being
able to be competitive with
enterprise-grade SSDs from the likes of
Intel or micron but the problem was that
we were sort of in like that
word zone where either we were gonna
have to tackle this from a let's be way
way cheaper and the same performance
perspective which wasn't gonna be as
much fun for me or we were gonna blow
the budget a little bit in order to beat
it by performance by beat it in
performance by a lot and I really wanted
our budget to be pretty much identical
and that is when these hit my inbox so
this is just shy of three master cartons
of something pretty special from Seagate
now if you had told me even three years
ago that someone was going to develop a
product designed for home users to put
SSDs in their naz's in their network
attached storage I'd have said no way
it's not ready the only way that that's
ever going to be economical is well just
to wait to wait more and wait more we
did this is Seagate's
iron wolf Nazz 3.8 4 terabyte SSD so
just like the rest of their iron wolf
family it includes they're actually oh
does it include that hey Anthony if you
need Hubble check if it includes oh yeah
it does look at that it's right on the
label like the rest of the iron will
family it includes their rescue data
recovery services so that is pretty
freakin sweet and it's rated for 24/7
operation and etc etc etc just like
their iron will family of hard drives so
this is it with four terabyte SSDs these
are priced at around 750 bucks a pop it
looks like we can get there so where do
I put my laptop oh wow where did I put
my laptop oh good there it is so let's
go ahead and fire up a ZFS calculator
and then we're gonna get all these
drives installed so this is a really
cool calculator over on win Telecom so
we're gonna use probably raid Z one
single parity our drive capacity is 38
40 gigs our drive cost is going to be
somewhere between 700 and 800 dollars a
unit I didn't say they were cheap just
to be very clear
guys and then number of drives for
groups so we've got how many drives do
you have six seven here and then I
believe these are both full master
cartons with ten units each so we've got
27 drives so there's a number of
different ways that we can break that up
now I was actually I was I had some very
old information and I thought that it
mattered a lot
how many drives you had in each one of
your Vedas
so that's your that's your groupings of
drives for ZFS but apparently that's
very outdated information doesn't
actually matter so there's a number of
different ways that we can tackle this
so let's go ahead and have a look
together so if we wanted to use all 27
of our drives we could go nine drives
per group we could say raid-z one single
parity and we could go okay we're gonna
have three raid groups and let's go
ahead and calculate what that gives us
so total raw storage is ninety four
usable storage capacity is about eighty
so let's go ahead and fire up the
jelly-fish here so if we only need 80
terabytes of usable capacity we actually
get to compete against the $35,000
jellyfish we can have up to four editors
so that's how they didn't know how many
Ethernet ports they're gonna put in the
machine so we've got four Ethernet ports
let's go ahead and click this storage
expansion no we already told you how
much yeah sure performance boost we're
boosted and then let's have a look so
our total is forty grand so let's see
how we're doing against that so our
total cost well it asks me how much my
drives cost but it doesn't actually
calculate that for me Oh total cost okay
so it's costing us 20 grand and drives
which gives us about twenty thousand
dollars to spend on a store inator that
should be okay or store Nadeau tornado
sorry sorry sorry
it's tornado yeah wow that's I think I
think we're gonna be okay here
so I guess they sent over the turbo
store NATO which starts at 10 grand we
did make some additions though so I
believe we're gonna run FreeNAS but that
doesn't affect the price because it's
free we're not running the redundant
power supply
we're gonna run 256 gigs of RAM we've
got redundant boot drives yes they are
90 305 so we've got two of those and we
have two dual copper Nix and our
warranties three-year that looks
comparable we don't have oh okay
so we don't have any after-sales support
and that is something that jellyfish
does and my understanding is they also
ship you too cold spare drives so we
should probably factor that into our
price to have a couple extra dive so
it's another 1,500 bucks so let's see
how much our story nadir is costing us
here seventeen for fifteen all right
so it looks like we are in business we
are like a grand grand and a half shy of
what the what a jellyfish would have
cost us for all solid state instead of
mechanical drives so let's go ahead and
do some drive installation porn here
Shelby
Oh am I gonna get demonetised is that a
bad word because you know they
transcribe everything you say right so
ten percent off the ridge wallet oh
shoot sorry guys here you want to throw
that to me oh no no we're at ow
all right Ridge wallet there you go
that's a ridge wallet so basically it
doesn't hold too much stuff and it's
supposed to de incentivize you from
carrying around unnecessary junk they
feel great
they're made of like anodized aluminum
they clip on and you can save 10% at the
link in the video description sorry
about that sorry alright okay alright
let's go ahead and install some drives
here probably the overhead
let's see if I can figure out how these
go in wow they have I gotta say these
guys have really really improved their
drive mounting mechanisms over the years
I'd like to see like a like a plasticy
mount for the hard drives as well
although there are there new friction
now are not new it's not that new
anymore but their friction mount with
the kind of I don't know what to call
them kind of like the spring metal on
the sides that's not that bad either man
I wish we had like an onscreen counter
for like how many terabytes we're adding
to this machine
3.8 four terabytes per drive just like
that I should probably also read some
super chats or something since I'm not
doing anything more useful right now
where's my mouse cursor there we go all
right ten more of these man I'm so amped
for this project it's always really cool
when I reach out to someone that I
really respect even though I don't know
his name
like Patrick from served the home and
he's like pack young man look to work
together that would be great he's also
got some really cool ideas for how we
could take this this initial project
which is find a magic server and
demonstrate that no it is not in fact
magic it's just some open source or free
to use software and some commodity
hardware that someone assembled in
fairness to them my understanding is
that their connector software like they
have a client connector software that
makes it so you don't have to go into a
web UI in order to configure your server
my understanding is that's pretty cool
but they only just got back to me with a
video demoing what that UI looks like so
I haven't had a look at that yet but I
will before the final video I'm
determined to make this as fair as I can
even though obviously like I said I am
coming in with the agenda of
demonstrating that no you should not
to be paying you know given that our
drives are what 20 grand of our costs
and if we were using hard drives with
just a small SSD cache it would be more
like 4 or 5 grand
I'm just yes my agenda is to demonstrate
but you shouldn't be paying an extra
$15,000 for a service plan and the
privilege of not having to log into a
web UI once in a while so we'll see
we'll see it's still possible that I'll
be wrong this could be a total dog come
on it cut David David okay okay
what's that canines iron wolf Oh would
you folks believe that he's a
professional writer thanks Anthony ah
all right Paul says take my money
Anthony is king I'm not sure if that's
for smoking me in the head with a ridge
wallet or something else but there you
go Anthony good work brian says take my
free super chat what do people get free
super chats for is that a thing I don't
know okay WTF name says lag oh sorry
Kenneth says take my free super check
what are these three super chats people
are talking about is this kind of like
on Amazon where you get a free switch to
find something or other once in a while
or I don't I don't know that google has
a service like that Jason says here's
two dollars towards your new bill yeah
two dollars so we only need another
what's that work out to twenty thousand
of those then we're good to go
that's okay though this stuff was
provided by 45 drives in Seagate so you
guys don't have to help me pay for this
it's all good what else we got Jake says
need your review of the thousand dollar
money understand that would actually be
another really fun project to see if we
can beat for half the price or you know
match for half the price or you know
beat for way less or something or beat
for the same price or something like
that what would a thousand dollar like
an action
well thousand dollar monitor Stan look
like I have I have no idea like it would
have to man if it had like like a
super-strong electromagnet or something
so you could like electromagnet it to a
thing and then it would be like super
solid and then you could like turn off
the electromagnet and then you could
like mount it somewhere else like like
how over-engineered would a legitimate
$1000 monitor stand have to be Oh
YouTube premium gives super test for
free okay sold and sent one two that's
absolutely fascinating all right Nick
says when is petabyte project getting
the full SSD upgrade uh never or all I
shouldn't say never never is a big word
but petabyte project is getting an
upgrade but it's going to be mechanical
storage not solid-state because even
this 80 usable terabytes of solid-state
storage like I said before is is 40
grand
all right let me to see if there's
anything else apparently I need to get
myself a mega pro screwdriver says James
no more random bits falling out of the
handle maybe I maybe I should look into
that
alright David Lee says free super chat
is included with YouTube's premium okay
thank you thank you very much all right
so this is it guys that was pretty much
the video today is the physical build
having a look at the machine that we're
going to be using to try to beat the
luma forge jellyfish isn't that
beautiful
I really wished that I had talked to
Seagate into sending over five more
because then it would be full but it's
actually okay we were trying to hit a
price target which is why I settled on
27 it wasn't it wasn't a totally
arbitrary decision I'm like super
excited about this so I believe Patrick
is flying up here in two weeks so in two
weeks we're going to be filming and then
after that we're going to
we bring in this video to you guys
actually one thing I should do is fire
it up real quick and make sure the thing
works because it would put a significant
damper on our plans
if this server was damaged and shipping
or something like that so let's go ahead
and I won't leave you guys in suspense
we're gonna we're gonna fire it up here
VGA yeah
because that onboard server video you
gotta love it right mouse and keyboard
would we do those cables no they are
awesome
I'm hoping it's pretty quiet it should
be it's almost all knocked to a fan's
except for the one in the except for the
one in the power supply let's go ahead
and fire it up
all right rock on that's a pretty
reasonable noise level loudest thing in
the system is definitely the power
supply it's interesting I thought they
were going to send over just like a
consumer power supply unit for this but
they ended up going with a zippe power
supply to be cleared I'm not complaining
that's a nice high quality super grade
power supply it's just not what I had
expected I thought I was gonna get like
of course there are m-series kind of
like their AV 512 oh I guess now would
be a good time to find out what kind of
CPUs they put in here as well that's
another thing that I still don't know
from luma Forge they wouldn't tell me
what CPUs they're using because that's I
guess proprietary information or
something so I'm just gonna ask one of
the folks that I know who owns one like
I don't get what you're trying to
accomplish by not just answering my
questions cuz clearly I'm gonna find the
answer it's just you're wasting my time
so then obviously that's not putting me
in a better mood about all this not that
I'm gonna let my mood affect things
we're gonna try to objectively beat it
all right let's just go ahead and get
this loaded up here
there's BOTS spamming porn that's weird
that's really weird huh how about that
YouTube really is a very special place
isn't it
man these super micro boards take a long
time to post a the worst is when you're
troubleshooting one of them because it's
like three minutes you know between
loading up the OS and rebooting and
detecting ipmi and all that kind of
stuff it's like three minutes for every
reboot every time you try to like change
something okay so the cards report
themselves as a vago but I thought that
they had actually been acquired since
then cuz I thought a vago got acquired
Broadcom okay there you go
so LSI acquired by a vago Avago acquired
by Broadcom you can take a moment to
appreciate the store NATO front plate
they asked if I wanted a custom one with
like our logo on it or whatever cuz they
have this like this direct metal printer
that they can use to do stuff like this
but I was like no I actually kind of
like the stocks tornado one I think it's
cool purple is an underutilized like
performance color I think I love it yeah
royal surgery come on baby
one of these days Super Micro you guys
might actually give a care about how
long your boards take to boot I'm not
like I'm not holding my breath for it
but someday maybe
come on okay here we go so it's working
that stick of memory I pulled out may
not have been receded correctly 200 wait
no yeah that's right yeah 256 gigs
around what do we got for CPU
configuration what are these xeon e5 26
20 v fours these are actually not that
state-of-the-art I'm I'd be interested
to know why they haven't upgraded to
some of the newer stuff I guess maybe
they found it doesn't matter well I
guess we're gonna see so that's pretty
much it for the video guys thank you for
tuning in to this live stream which on
youtube probably won't end up being live
the reason for that is that youtube
actually took a full week and I still
don't know if it's actually done
correctly to transcode last week's wine
show that's why it never showed up on
YouTube there was no problem with the
show or anything like that but instead
of being an hour-long video YouTube was
detecting that it was 2 hours long and
it was full of like weird skipping and
and repetition it was some kind of a
problem on their side that they claimed
it was something to do with the outages
that they experienced last weekend but I
don't actually buy it because the land
show from the previous week had the same
bloody issue so what we're gonna do with
this video is we are going to upload it
separately to YouTube so it'll just be a
regular Vlad so sorry guys if we notify
you twice but what are we supposed to do
if they can't manage to take these live
videos and publish them in a reasonable
time frame like we can't have people
waiting a week to watch something it's
old news by that point so alright that's
it if you guys dislike this video you
can hit that button but if you liked it
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy this
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like o
has cool hoodies like this one it's
finally in stock ltte store calm so Wow
I actually love this thing and one of
the top features is the phone pocket so
it's big enough to hold an iPhone 10 s
max or a note 9 and secure enough that
your phone doesn't come out with which i
think is pretty sweet but you can get it
out easily see that so that's just
there's your technique for putting it in
there's your technique for getting it
out but if you're like you know bending
over to pick some
thing up you can never have your phone
drop out again yeah alright peace guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
