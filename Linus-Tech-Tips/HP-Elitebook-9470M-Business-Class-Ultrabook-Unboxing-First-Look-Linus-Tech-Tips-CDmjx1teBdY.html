the elite book 94 70 M from HP this is a
demo unit as part of their Saha HP q
demo program so they sent this to me to
have a look at and I'm pretty excited
about it so this is an elite book which
makes it a business class product but it
is also an ultra book so this ultra book
right here is actually less than 0.75
inches thick and I'm sorry I have to do
the unboxing like this but slick is just
sort of taking a sweet time over there
with some benchmarking that needs to be
honest let's get these seals up and up
and we'll be back in a moment
alright so i guilted slick and coming
over here and actually helping me which
is his job so he's pointing the camera
at stuff he's all like ooh my arms
injured cuz I got in a bicycle accident
he'll heal as if that's an excuse
actually his arms really badly injured a
few hubs sorry it's not funny but if you
watch the livestream last week you can
see it was in like a sling and stuff and
now I've just thought him like holding
the camera it's only been like four days
um so we're finding some pretty cool
stuff in here look at that very slim
very small power adapter very nice I
mean it's one thing when you have an
ultrabook notebook but it's a whole
other thing when it comes with like a
big brick old stupid power supply that's
like big and stupid a brick so here's
the included battery which is good for
up to nine hours of battery life
it's swappable which is pretty elite if
you want to sort of consider what's
different about this from another ultra
book it also has an optional what's
called a slice battery which will give
the notebook up to 19 hours of battery
life should you choose to install that
so check out how thin this battery is
very cool stuff see there's the the old
iPhone size comparison very very small
and it's just it's phenomenally cool to
me that you can just totally swap the
no big deal I mean most ultrabooks you
can't do that
love that industry trend started by the
one and only Apple Computer because
they're awesome that way and Oh check
this out very cool
so again business class product so it
has some different options that were not
used to seeing on consumer products it
comes pre-installed with Windows 7 Pro
however it also comes with a Windows 8
pro DVD and license so what you can do
is you can only install one of them at a
time but you can uninstall Windows 7 Pro
then install Windows 8 Pro and you can
choose which of those two operating
systems you want to use on your notebook
and then you can even just uninstall
Windows 8 and put Windows 7 back on it
should you so desire which is very very
cool so the process of installing the
battery is what we're going to do next
not a lot included in terms of
accessories however there's lots of
optional accessories that you can get to
go with it which again makes it kind of
business class because the assumption is
that unlike a consumer product it
doesn't need to come with everything and
that business users won't necessarily
mind forking out for additional
accessories so it is dock ready which
means you can install it in a dock for
additional i/o and for the convenience
of not having to plug and unplug your
peripherals as you move around from the
office to home or wherever else you need
to go it also has yeah that was
apparently not how to do it there now
we're in place yep we're good it also
has awesome i/o so you've got three USB
three SuperSpeed ports two on this side
DisplayPort and VGA VGA is still a huge
boon to business users because of the
fact that as you're traveling lots of
boardrooms lots of presentation rooms
are still using older VGA projectors and
if you show up with a notebook that
doesn't have an analog output you're not
going to be able to give your
presentation so this guy will figure out
in a moment full-sized Ethernet
connector no sort of little connector
hoo-ha doodad thing going on here so it
should be very durable I've also got an
SD card reader right there hiding and on
the back you have nothing except a look
Hewlett Packard no no you're not looking
at that it's okay finally we've got
power in Kensington lock exhaust that
other USB 3 superspeed port that I
talked about as well as an integral
I did headphone microphone jack wouldn't
have minded seeing two jacks there if
they'd been able to get away with that
sorry I mess that up before guys this
right here is the connector for the
optional extended battery that gives you
up to 19 hours of battery life on this
thing and this guy right here is
actually the dot connector so I don't
really use business model notebooks that
much I wasn't familiar with that thing
so I'm quite sorry about that this guy
over here is a smart card reader and
that was where we left off and I think
I'm caught up now so we can move around
to the front where we have wireless
power charging and disk activity LEDs
let's go ahead and open this bad boy up
where we find a matte screen again
business options proper matte screen no
glossy stuff going on in here
we've also got a hardware button for
turning the wireless on and off as well
as a hardware mute button this is a
really cool indicator right here this is
to tell you if your touchpad is on or
off so you can use the touchpad on or
off hotkey in order to turn it on and
off and then you'll actually know
whether it's on and off you can see it's
got a very businesslike layout to the
inside as well
nice big touchpad and then you've got
the option of either using buttons here
or using the mouse nipple which is in
the middle of the keyboard here to
navigate and then using these two
buttons here for your left and right
click the keyboard is led back that you
can see it's quite bright because even
though I've got my studio lights on here
it's very clearly illuminated I'm going
to go ahead and turn one off to give you
guys an even better idea and I'll stand
in the way the other one so looks just
hold on they went away give it a sec
let's wait till the machine boots up and
then we'll be I will be good to show
that off okay so I figured it out it
turns off as a power saving feature so
you guys can see what it looks like
normally aha see I wasn't crazy the LED
backlight was on so it shines through
the letters you can see the red light on
the camera that's no good so it shines
through the letters as well as around
the outside the letter so it should be
very easy to find what you're working on
even the utmost darkness so you got a
fingerprint reader here which is handy
for your biometric logins and all that
and whatnots and who has and in terms of
the overall layout of the keyboard it
looks very strong so you got a long in
turkey long backspace key
long shift long shift and no cardinal
sins committed in terms of the overall
layout oh man that thing's solid
I love elite books like there's there's
sorry sorry for the noise guys but
there's no flex whatsoever to this
machine it is incredibly solidly built
in spite of the fact that it doesn't use
that unibody design that was popular
popularized by by our friends over at
Apple decide which quite frankly isn't a
very environmentally friendly way to
manufacture laptops so it's it's just as
well that HP's found a way to make a
laptop not be manufactured that way and
still be very very solid so speaking of
our friends at Apple I'm going to go
ahead and do the obligatory thickness
comparison with the iPhone 4 this is a
14 inch notebook so the Ultrabook
standard allows it to be a little bit
thicker than ultra books that are not 14
inches it has a 1366 by 768 display and
it is 100 look let's see what we think
about their display shouldn't get hard
to figure out and it just noted two yun
puddle yay love 19 panels I mean that's
the thing you get with the lead books is
you get that slightly higher build
quality versus the consumer grade stuff
it has the trusted platform module chip
embedded which gives you more security
again this is a very corporate oriented
feature and what's cool about this touch
pad is it will never ever wear out
because it is chemically etched glass
unlike most track pads which you're
using like a plastic or some kind of
composite surface so it doesn't feel
like glass but it's a little bit cool to
the touch and it will never ever ever
ever wear out which is very very very
cool as well as optional LTE support
although that's not built into this
particular model that I'm checking out
let's see how the hinge feels we'll give
it the old hinge abuse feels it actually
feels quite solid and even the screen
itself doesn't have that much flex
either check this out so it's very very
thin okay there's the old iPhone
comparison do doop doop very thin
however see how much flex there's
there's a little bit there's no getting
away from that
really
not that much very very nice let's if
there's any look at that you don't even
get any discoloration on the screen when
you do that that's outstanding
very very nice all right so thank you
