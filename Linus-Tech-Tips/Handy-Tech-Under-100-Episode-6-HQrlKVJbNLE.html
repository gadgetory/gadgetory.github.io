today and that video will be coming soon
so make sure you're subscribed but
instead I wasted half a day trying to
get my capture PC to work so we're
moving this episode up in the schedule
it's handy check under a hundred time
again it's episode six already the
coolermaster neptune 240m features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more now this is a bit of an unusual
thing for handy tech but both of our
first two items are from a new site that
I was directed to by a viewer called mod
diy.com I'll start with the one that a
DS codes mods on Twitter asked me to
feature you know how most PC cases have
two or sometimes four front USB ports
and some of them are usually USB 3 these
days and yet most motherboards still
support anywhere from four to eight
front USB two ports off of two to four
headers yeah sure Linus I follow along
but it doesn't seem like much of a
problem just leave the headers
unpopulated who cares well hold on a
second there mr. impatient you know how
wireless peripherals always come with
those little dongles that either take up
space in the rear i/o or hang out the
front of your computer just begging to
be accidentally bumped so you wreck your
USB port or the dongle now you see where
I'm going with this this my friends is
an internal header two single port
adapter for USB two now if you have
something you rarely need to access like
a wireless USB dongle or bluetooth
adapter USB encryption key or even a USB
boot drive for something like FreeNAS
for example but you want to keep tucked
away inside the tower then as long as
your reception is still good enough for
wireless stuff with it in there you can
plug it in and hide it away with one of
these little puppies leaving your other
ports tidally empty which leads us into
handy tech item number two for today I
was browsing their site to see if they
had any other cool stuff while I was
placing my order for these bad boys and
came across these little guys
many video cards come with little dust
covers for the ports but most other
stuff notably laptops doesn't and it's
the kind of thing that can actually be a
major concern I've broken headphone
jacks before by accidentally getting
debris in them no more with these handy
dandy port covers you can get them for a
wide variety of different types of ports
and the ones we order are easy to remove
if you really want to but also fit
really nice and snug so they shouldn't
accidentally come out and get lost not
that they're terribly expensive if you
do lose them and I'd suggest just
ordering a whack ten at a time so you do
have extras another great use for them
if you build systems as a hobby or even
for business is to block off the jacks
that you don't want your friends or your
customers to use so a great example of
where this would be useful would be
blocking off the output from an onboard
sound or graphics card if the PC has
discrete ones yay no more calls in the
middle of night all like oh yeah I
unplugged it and I plugged it back in
it's not working anymore
yay and our last handy tech item today
number three is great for hobbyists and
professionals alike now while we've
shown off magnetics parts trays in the
past in fact I have one of them right
here and these are still recommended as
a super cheap way to keep track of metal
stuff like screws today's organization
item the creatively named magnetic
project mat from I fix it is a bit more
of a premium option at 20 bucks but one
that I think justifies its extra cost
for certain use case scenarios to be
clear it doesn't have the same raw
magnetic well that was a bad demo there
you go raw magnetic strength that our
Titans do so you won't be holding any
automotive nuts and bolts on it and it
doesn't stick to a nearby fridge racking
unit or any other vertical or even
upside-down surface when it's blow up
screws but the adequate magnetic
strength yes you can even tip it
sideways if you're kind of careful and
don't put something too heavy on it the
grid layout for keeping different kinds
of screws separate and the dry erase
marker compatible surface for labeling
make it a great way to keep various
types of screws organized as you go
about our project it's got a foam
backing on it to keep it from slipping
all over the place and it comes with a
nice non smearing marker with an
attached
racer on the back so you can really keep
track of what you're doing
speaking of non smearing or something
our friends over at mass drop have
decided to sponsor us to call out yet
another drop this time for a pair of
mass drop exclusive AKG K seven xx
headphones a variation of their 65th
anniversary edition K 702 which has been
configured by the audio files at mass
drop and manufactured by the audio
experts at AKG now normally the way math
drop works and you should definitely
check them out that is the point of them
sponsoring these videos is they find
awesome products that get a starting
price if like one person buys it a
bottom price if like a wack ton of
people buy it and then a bunch of prices
in between then the more people glom on
to the deal the lower the price goes
until it gets to that bottom one so it's
usually pretty hard for me to call out
how much the featured deal item is
actually gonna cost cuz it'll be
somewhere in that range but in this case
it's already hit the bottom lowest
possible price of $1.99 so yeah if you
already know you want some K 700s then
rock on go for it there's a referral
link that doesn't give us a commission
but does let them know that we sent you
linked in the video description if
you're not too familiar with this
particular headphone I've actually had a
pair of K 702 s for months but haven't
gotten around to reviewing them so I'll
be trying to get that done before the
drop is over so stay tuned for that
which leads us into the last and
possibly most important part of any
handy tech episode the full disclosure
part our first two items the port covers
and the internal USB adapter were
purchased by me for use at work and at
home based on the suggestion of a viewer
and the last one was sent to me by I fix
it when I asked them which adhesive I
needed to disassemble the my Mac retina
they recognized who I was and sent over
the adhesive and some other knickknacks
including this so I didn't buy this one
but if I didn't already have one and had
heard of it I would be picking one up
because it's only about 20 bucks and if
you guys have ever gone through losing
like that one screw especially when
you're working on something small like a
cell phone something like this could be
a lifesaver and the kind of thing where
when you're in that situation if you
could if you could pull $20 out of your
pocket just to have that screw back you
might do it so there you go anyway guys
