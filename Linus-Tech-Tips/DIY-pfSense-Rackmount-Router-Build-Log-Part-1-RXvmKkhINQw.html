build vlog around here we are gonna be
building ourselves a badass new router
yes we've got a wicked new internet
connection we need a wicked new custom
pfSense box to go with it so come along
for the ride cuz this one I promise you
is going to be interesting the
mastercase 5 from Coolermaster gives you
the freedom to truly make your mid tower
case your own with modular parts and
accessories click on the link in the
video description to learn more you
missed their lungs yeah first thing I
need to do is follow my own rules about
no garbage in the new office - next
let's have a look at the hardware we're
going to be using so step one is CPU
we've got a low-power Intel Xeon CPU
this is an e3 1260 L this is an Intel S
1200 KP server board provided by
Kingston we've got kind of a special
stick of memory in here so this is a low
profile
ddr3 dent we've got a 1u server case so
this is a rack mountable case that'll be
going in our new cabinet from norcombe
you could install up to I believe an ATX
sized board in here if you really wanted
to but we're just going to be installing
an ITX board because we're going to be
using this space over here for an
expansion card
yes it's an i3 4 TT 4 quad port network
card and we're actually going to be
installing that sideways we're also
going to need this was provided by
Anthony over at NCI XO huge thanks to
the MC IX tech tips crew this is a PCI
Express extension what else we got for
hardware now yeah we're gonna be using
an SSD yes I know pfsense can run off a
USB stick I don't care the next this is
a really cool piece of hardware it so
this a 1u redundant power supply so each
of these is an 80 plus gold 250 watt
power supply and then you can actually
slide these modules out
last piece of hardware this is a Super
Micro heatsink and that's another
challenge in one you case you can't even
use a stock Intel cooler you might be
thinking to yourself gee Linus that
doesn't have any fans on it how is it
gonna cool the CPU great question I
think this is definitely the most
constrained case that I've ever worked
in the part I was worried about was the
clearance at the back now I already know
about some challenges that I'm gonna
have fitting our power supply in this
case so the board goes in here you can
see all of my ports stick through just
fine but the case is actually shorter
and if standard high household if I mark
this really carefully I can basically
just hack it off with a dremel tool aha
I'm getting so much metal in my eye
not too shabby I hope oh my way overdid
it look at that so that is what its
gonna look like okay so the next step is
to get our CPU installed so the CPU
we're using is 1260 L we could swap this
out with relative ease if we needed a
beefier router
let's go ahead and install our back
plate oh okay this chip on the back is
interfering with our back place shoot
and we're gonna need the angle grinder
for this this is not a dremel task
okay not bad at all
just clean it off I might want to take
that in a little bit tighter so there
we've dug out a little bit more material
still fairly strong I mean strong enough
to hold a cooler on so uh yeah there we
go
we've got lots of clearance around the
contacts for that chip there so
orientation here is key
because the air flow only goes one way
so our CPU cooler needs to be you have
got to be kidding me we are making
contact with the pins and the fan header
right there so the speakers okay but
that fitness to the pins has to go this
is intended to sit right flat against
the back of the board but there's quite
a few things on the back of this board
we might just barely be able to screw
into that back plate and then this
corner yeah that goes in it's a fair bit
of flex on the board but nothing deadly
not a thing yeah I think we should just
hack off the top of this speaker - it
should be enough to get the job done I
just don't want those pins to touch
yeah take that speaker we've been at
this for like an hour and we've
installed an IO shield and install the
CPU in a socket
I haven't even managed to put a heatsink
on hold thermal compound there let's put
the backplate on again so if I could
just get this on here then we're good
okay
no clearance issues this time not too
shabby
next step put motherboard in case so
this heatsink basically sits millimeters
from the top of the chassis
meaning that you cannot install a fan on
there most one you coolers are like side
blowers you know we wanted to leave
ourselves room for a beefier CPU in the
future if we wanted it so that option
was not going to work for us we're gonna
have to be careful when we slide this on
we gotta cover ok this is the next big
challenge I had no idea that there even
were standards for when you power
supply's these two are not the same one
the way that this goes in just has
absolutely nothing to do with what the
back of this power supply looks like
that leaves me basically cutting the
case to get this in here so I need to
get this in here and I need to secure it
somehow
you know what let's just hot glue it in
because I don't feel that comfortable
drilling into the side of a power supply
the last place you want metal shards
okay
go in go in push down cable management
is gonna be key for achieving any kind
of proper airflow in a system like this
yep power LEDs great so this my friends
is where we start to get into why it was
important that we use this low profile
ECC memory a full-height dim would
pretty much block air flow to our fins
now some boards have the dims this way
this one does not so we have to deal
with what we're given to work with here
next up mounting the PCI Express card oh
cool you can actually install it either
way
Wow I don't know if we're even gonna get
a 4x extender in here our cable
management is done so we have a nice
clear path two of those so we have a
nice clear path from our fans to
everything here that needs to be cooled
the heatsink on our NIC the heatsink on
our CPU and all that's left to do let's
close her up
and find out how she runs now what I'm
actually gonna do is put Windows on this
machine first just so that I can use
nice familiar testing tools in order to
evaluate cooling because I am a little
bit worried about this CPU
so we were defeated we were defeated by
a dead mother born but eBay to the
rescue I can't say enough good things
about eBay I ordered this motherboard a
250 watt power supply and four gigs of
RAM at least I cut the motherboard
fortunately I didn't need that other
crap so let's go ahead and rebuild the
machine this time with a Oh working
motherboard oh crap I can't even do it
right the second time around let's try
putting the actual cooler backplate on
here I don't know how I missed this
before but on the old board which
fortunately we can now use as a tester
for the additional cutting that it looks
like we're gonna be doing there are a
couple of components here that are
clearly interfering with the backplate
still so we actually need to do more
backplate cutting so in theory this one
actually fits on the board ok great it
shouldn't be this much effort I build a
router this is why most people probably
buy order Nina have them at the store
they have a whole aisle called routers
ah alright and this speaker
you know just rip this off this time
that seems ill-advised on my working
board doesn't it you could use the
sacrificial board to find out if you can
rip the speaker off okay you can't now
we know we can use a dremel if I can
find it oh yeah there it is sure there
we go in theory we are ready let's sleep
it's on nothing ever takes as long as
it's supposed to okay that's in let's
put our cable management nonsense back
into place that's nice least I don't
have to plan out the cable management
anymore since I've already done it once
there we go okay so that's good so in
theory this time this stupid thing
powers on come on baby please work what
okay I'm at a total loss right now I'm
not sure what just happened I have
nothing to say at this point I I think
something about our config just killed
another board but I don't understand why
that would happen because the only thing
in here that I haven't run in this board
before is a PCI Express riser and RAM
which shouldn't make a board scream and
then die it's unheard of but I think we
just killed another board exact same
behavior as last time we're getting
beeps and then we stopped getting beeps
our working hypothesis right now is that
this is some kind of connector that I've
never seen before and was actually
providing power to the motherboard
instead of acting as like an RPM sense
or something so we're testing with the
multimeter now we just bricked two
boards time to order another one I guess
sue tuned for part two so I learned a
lot in this video you know what else I
learned Squarespace their websites look
better than me writing on a chalkboard
yes my friends they do with Squarespace
calm you can build yourself a beautiful
functional website that serves whatever
purpose it is that you're into you want
to make a website about Luke having the
best butt in the biz or how it doesn't
you can do that you can make a blog you
can make a personal portfolio you can
make a hey you can make a store you can
have a store where you sell you know
license plate covers that say Luke has
best but in biz or you know something
people might actually want to buy say
for example so head over to
squarespace.com slash I think it's Linus
I should know this kind of thing by now
so head over to squarespace.com and if
you guys use offer code line
you can save 10% but you don't have to
buy it upfront you guys can try it out
for a couple weeks for free they do a
free trial you can play around with
their tools they've got 24/7 tech
support so if you're having trouble
building your site you can reach out to
someone via email or a live chat and get
them to help you out great stuff they've
got all kinds of stuff that like I used
to talk about but isn't in my talking
points anymore but I still think is cool
like their little logo builder app and
they've got this really cool thing
coming up that
oh I guess I wasn't supposed to talk
about that sorry sorry well whatever
they're always developing their tools
and making them better all the time so
squarespace.com make a beautiful website
all of your own alright so thanks for
