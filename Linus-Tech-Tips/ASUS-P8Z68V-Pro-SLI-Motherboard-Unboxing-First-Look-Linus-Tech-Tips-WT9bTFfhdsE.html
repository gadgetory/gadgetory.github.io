product to unbox from a soos this is the
p8z 68 V Pro or if you prefer p8z 68 V
pro personally I don't care I'll see
whatever sort of works with the sentence
as many of you have noticed and
commented one way or the other FSA Z
there's Z zealots running after me to
tell me that it's wrong and that's
vice-versa anyway this board features
digital power design as well as their
TPU and EPU dual intelligent processors
so these are for energy savings and
performance alright we've got full
support for Intel's latest Core i5 i3
and i7 processors on the LGA 1155 socket
this uses the z68 chipset so what that
means is that besides supporting those
technologies besides supporting SLI and
crossfire and all those performance
features we also have support for Intel
Smart Response SRT technology which
means you can use a small SSD 60 gigs or
smaller to boost the performance of your
boot hard drive and we also have the
lucid virtu technology which allows you
to use the onboard video that's built
into your core i3 i5 or i7 CPU to
accelerate certain key things like video
encoding while normally using your
dedicated graphics card for gaming
pretty sweet all right we got USB 3 au
efi bios we have bt go bluetooth
enjoyment maybe we'll have to find out
what that is
GPU boost for for increasing the
performance of the onboard graphics as
well as their precise digi+ VRM let's
have a look at the back digital power
design the new standard basically it's
better ok we have the ultimate turbo
processor so that's the TPU the epu for
energy efficiency as I mentioned before
oh here we go
diverse Bluetooth enjoyment oh it means
onboard bluetooth ok UEFI BIOS ok yeah
that's pretty much endless stuff get
this open oh I have never seen well at
least not in a
no I don't think I've ever seen in this
new sport that comes in a box like this
where the board is on top of the package
with the accessories underneath you know
what then we're going to do something
crazy and we're gonna look at the board
first and then the accessories because
the suit has gone and turned my world
upside down with their packaging change
here so here we go here's the
motherboard itself let's start with the
CPU socket where we normally start you
don't have to move around so much just
kind of top down as okay CPU socket so
there's your LGA 1155 socket which as I
mentioned before features support for
the latest I 3 i5 and i7 processors on
the LGA 1155 socket you are surrounded
by your one two three four five six
seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
hmm I don't know how many phases that
power design is because I count 16 but
it could be like a 14 plus 2 or
something like that so someone leave a
comment on the video as well how many
phases of power in the digi+ vrm on the
p8z 68 v pro we have support for a dual
channel ddr3 memory and that is pretty
typical for an 1155 board because that's
all the 1155 onboard CPU ddr3 memory
controller actually supports all right
on the side here we have the EPU and TPU
switches if you do want to use those
technologies we also have the mem ok
button so what the mem ok button allows
you to do is take out of J techSpec RAM
modules and boot them up using a safe
setting but then you can get into the
BIOS and set them to whatever higher
performance settings you desire our 24
pin and our 8 pin connectors are in
their ideal locations along the
right-hand edge of the board and at the
top left respectively and moving down we
have a USB 3 front panel header so that
will have support for all the latest
cases with USB 3 that do use a pin out
rather than a pass-through from a normal
port like this ok
so we've also got SATA ports galore so
we have 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
and 4 say 2 3 6 gigabit per second now
these two right here are coming off the
Intel controller and these
you are coming off of a third-party
controller so if you did want to run
like a six drive raid array you would
want to use these six so these are more
like your auxiliary ones all right we've
got a chipset cooler here using a
similar kind of wave looking design to
many of us uses recent motherboards we
have two firewire ports there's our
front panel headers three USB 2.0 ports
built-in switches I'm a big fan of these
because I often use boards on a test
bench this makes my life easier reset
and power are both included front audio
is right here and let's have a look at
the PCI slot layout on this particular
board we've got seven slots
I love seeing seven slots on an ATX form
factor board you want to know why
because that's the most you can have and
I always like having the option to
install more stuff rather than not
having the option to install more stuff
okay so we have three PCIe 16x slots
right here the dark blue the white one
and the black one these two looks this
one's wired for 16 this guy is wired for
8 and this guy is wired for 8 although
I'm going to have to double check what
bandwidth these actually run at we've
got two PCI slots two PCIe 1x slots and
on the back we've got a pretty normal
looking array of connectors we have four
USB six USB 2.0 ports our little
bluetooth guy right here we have optical
audio out HDMI DVI and VGA out which are
supported on all second generation Core
i7 processors unlike the first
generations where it was only supported
on dual cores do we have two USB 3.0
ports Intel Ethernet rather than a third
party such as a real tech Ethernet
solution and 7.1 audio so now let's look
at the accessories for anyone who
actually cares about that okay one
accessory thought this is neat is a USB
header to dual port PCI bracket for the
back so if you can if you don't have
front USB three you can add a couple
more ports to the back at the very least
we have to us to say two three six
gigabit per second cables two USB three
gigabit per second cables although
they're identical other than the white
color on the six gigabit per second ones
and they are all right angle we have an
SLI bridge we have Q connectors which
are the easy
actors for the front panel headers an IO
shield a user guide a drivers and
utilities DVD don't use it download the
latest from the Sue's website as well as
a SATA mode notice interesting pretty ok
how to turn on HCI mode which is good
HCI mode is better than IDE mode for
more performance and whatnot give me
just a second here guys so I looked up
the PCIe slots and I thought maybe
because this one is wired for 8x they
have some kind of splitter chip on here
of some sort but they do not so it's 16
X 8 X 8 X or 8 X 8 X 4x just as with
most p67 boards thank you for checking
