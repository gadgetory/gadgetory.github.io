euskal eyeful drinking Bob Walden I was
trying to go drink before going going
light happened before I was quite ready
because see the little green square goes
on in the corn you know what I'm still
thirsty one second all right
good start sorry I was just well I did
the other live stream earlier today
where we answered the question once and
for all why there are so many people
working here
well we answered the question what
exactly it is that they do but we
actually did not answer why it is that
we need so many of them maybe that'll be
part two yeah next time that you just
don't know what to do on a Friday yeah
next time Linus isn't sure what to
stream owner for okay so hold on a
second in my defense I actually have
plenty of ideas for what to stream on a
Friday okay would you like to hear them
sure yeah idea number one first
impressions of the huawei P 30 Pro what
are they that wouldn't that have been
interesting yeah I can't tell you
because that's not what we did today
idea number two first impressions of the
Nubia alpha the wraparound flexible
display Smart Watch would you like to
know what they are it's large and looks
really weird well no I mean don't you
want to know my first impressions having
actually used it sure yeah I'm sorry I
can't tell you that's not what we stream
up um I had another we're still good
yeah I had another idea there's these
like double capacity dims that are
pretty cool and there's rebuilding the
red camera but that I need like four or
five hours for I think yeah that's
anyway well so the problem was just
actually that I didn't have enough I
didn't have enough time and space to set
up the camera that I needed in order to
do any of those other ones so I went
with like more like a QA so a lot of
people have actually asked me that over
the years and I lied I actually do
intend to give my first impressions of
the p30 Pro and the Nubia alpha here on
the show that's actually kind of a great
summary of my first impressions of the
Nubia alpha hold on a second there you
go ladies and gentlemen that is a dead
battery indicator
so I charged this this morning when I
got to the office
oh yeah it's pretty rough doesn't have a
camera yeah heck yeah Oh weird it's not
very good it's like potato camera like
iPhone 5 maybe that's higher than I was
expecting you to say maybe maybe maybe
like 4s I don't know well well I will
I'll do some more actual comparisons
later but yeah I'm actually it's one of
those things where normally I don't
really cover smartwatches anymore but I
feel like this thing is so utterly
unique that it is worth doing a full
dedicated video on because there's a lot
of stuff about it that is super bad like
really bad I mean I got less than 6
hours of my no over 6 hours less than 7
hours of battery life out of it today
that's not acceptable like it has asleep
it has like sleep health functions
yeah honestly though it makes no sense
this is this is actually this is
something I almost feel like I should do
a rant about like the state of wearables
right now the number of them that have
sleep tracker functionality but only
lasts for a single day on battery when
am i when am i collecting this data my
watch is on the charger
obviously this is an income unless I nap
a lot it's not getting any meaningful
sleep data from me like I actually found
out to my surprise that the galaxy watch
which I hate which is the reason I
haven't reviewed it cuz it just like I
couldn't find anything good to say about
it the galaxy watch surprised me when I
did have an app when I was on vacation I
woke up and it was like your sleep was
73 percent efficient and I was like oh
cool
that one actually makes more sense than
this one because it actually does last
for a few days on battery but my thing
is that if you don't last for prove me
wrong okay get ready okay if it doesn't
last for a full week on battery there's
not much point in it lasting more than
one day oh hundred percent yeah
you're supposed to prove me get the
segment deeds I want Luke back firstly
Oh like I know Luke I know what you're
trying to say but if you're going for
two days who cares you still need to
worry about it every single time this
was actually the biggest problem that I
had with the pixel buds really because
you stole those for a little while yeah
I stole them and then I liked them and
then I found out that I hated them and
gave them back so that was because like
I always just ended up in this really
weird situation where I'd be doing
something and they would just die and
I'd be like this is terrible but like
they last long enough that like I don't
remember to plug it in every single
night cuz that's dumb they last like
four days maybe but they died soon
enough that you regularly run into
issues of it just dying on you so if it
was like weakly maybe I could remember
to do it like over the weekend or like
once every four days you can like toss
it on and be like okay yeah it's getting
a bit low but no so I actually have the
exact same issue I've been I've been
trying to join the 21st century and this
is Sennheiser's momentum something
around there I forget what the model
number is let me actually let me look
this up for you guys well I think it's
momentum Wireless it's a nice case
they're called momentum true Wireless so
they're cold yeah yeah here they are so
I'm gonna go ahead and fire this up this
is the center oh no no this is the
Sennheiser momentum true Wireless they
come in a nice little case I've got got
it right here they it's a charging case
just like you know most wireless
earphones they're actually very
comfortable like they're quick to put in
they are truly Wireless there's no
tether that goes between them or
anything like that they stay in really
really well for me like I could do this
forever I'd get uncomfortable and
nauseated before they would come out of
my ears they sound good there's there's
actually a lot to like here but I don't
know if mine are defective see that's
that's one thing
because I'll find that I'll just not
touch them for a little while
and I'll come back to them and like it's
completely dead like there's no
indicator whatsoever so I'm just I'm
finding that as someone who uses
earphones a lot but not every waking
moment of every day I am also in this
really awkward in-between where like I
need them often enough and they're not
available for me that it's really
annoying but I don't need them all the
time so I don't constantly have my
finger on the pulse where's my battery
life at do I need to charge these things
up yeah and like honestly they charge up
really fast and the pixel buds do too
yeah like if you've got adapter cable
and battery bank handy which like 99% of
the time I do like that's fine but my
conference call starts in three minutes
and I don't have time for this right now
or it's like it might take like 10
minutes to get a pretty good charge but
like I want to clean the kitchen and
have like a podcast going and the
kitchens cleaned by the time that
they're charged so I don't know maybe
it's possible that we're just idiots I
don't think so I just went out and
bought like three pairs of pixel
headphones they're types II just plug
them in yep good to go I just leave them
everywhere so that was another problem
that I had like you have the wireless
headphones and you just forget them
somewhere right so back to my complaint
about the galaxy I was saying that if it
doesn't last for I would say a week is
the magic number if it doesn't last for
a week there's really not much point in
it lasting more than one robust day like
one no matter what you do to it day
because it's going to have to be part of
your daily routine to charge them versus
part of your before I go to work on
Monday routine is that kind of does that
kind of make sense yeah with that said I
can I can actually talk about some of
the others
so notifications are a hot mess the
overall functionality of it is just kind
of weird like the I wish I could show
you guys except it's dead
but like this much of the screen like
the part that actually really faces the
user like a traditional watch has your
watch information and then down at the
bottom here is your 6th most or 9 6 or 9
most recently used applications or
functions ok which is fine it's kind of
like a like a alt tab you know like your
last things or like recents your recents
button on your android phone and then up
at the top is all your toggles for like
bluetooth oh okay no Barlet but why are
those there all the time well I was also
wondering that that about the apps like
it's like on the tape watch you just
swipe down and you get all the toggles
yeah yes wipe to the left and get all
the apps right so this is just there
just there all the time so they just
it's kind of like they had more screen
real estate but they didn't have a clear
idea of what to do with it and that's
the impression that I'm getting from it
right now with that said the screen is
like it's surprisingly it looks
surprisingly good for how bendable it is
you can hold up and it feels ok like
here if you feel it it feels a little
bit plasticky but also reasonably glassy
like it's not bad it's clearly not the
same technology that they'd be using in
the Galaxy fold like there's a limit to
how far you can go here oh and look it
fire it up okay let's see if I can get
you guys a little bit of a tour of it
here and then I can talk about the P
actually we should roll the intro or
something also luke sick alex is here
today hi here we go guys like the very
brief tour you're missing it because
nice it takes a little while to boot up
yep it doesn't have integration with
like third-party music apps as far as I
can tell what I've only tried Google
Play Music so far I'm gonna try Spotify
as well just to make just as a sanity
check so
did it die it died blow is moving up
whatever ah that's like the main thing
that I like about a SmartWatch is just
switching the song because like I'll be
doing things all the time with my hands
and then you can just kind of like going
with your nose and change the song see
that right there is what I miss about
the pebble honestly I actually found my
old pebble time and I put it I hot-glued
a magnet to the back of it and then I
hot-glued another magnet to my motorbike
and then I just put it on there
cuz you can have more than one
SmartWatch connected to your phone at a
time so while I'm riding with my gloves
on I can change the track that's smart
you cannot do that what's like any
modern SmartWatch it drives me nuts
tactile buttons have a place and that
place is your wrist like the whole point
of a SmartWatch is that my hands are
occupied or full or covered or somehow
unable to like this is here look this is
how much time I'm trying to save that's
that's what you're up against Smart
Watch if you're not more efficient than
that the game is over and that's one of
my biggest problems with the galaxy
watch is I'll get a notification it must
be a power saving thing because it does
get multiple days of battery and they
must have done that somehow even with an
always-on display it gets more than two
days which is amazing but it must be
like a power saving thing because I'll
get a notification on my phone will be
like oh there's my watch notification
okay I've been having that issue too
like I have the tick wash and it was
like the same time until like maybe two
weeks ago and then it's a several second
delay and I just haven't worn it since
because that's what you're up against
like this phone okay is locked I can
have it up and unlocked in that amount
of time if you're not faster and more
convenient you have no place on my wrist
and especially the ones that don't have
an always-on clock now
you're not even faster and more
convenient to check the top yeah this
one's a little thick I I think it looks
cool i we had this debate you know what
I'm gonna roll the intro roll the intro
we can debate whether it looks cool one
moment please
we'll respond sir by the LPG store
and displays magnet mounted metal art
and of course private Internet access
okay now we've got some haters got some
haters over there in the YouTube chat so
I'm gonna go over to floatplane chat
which is my safe space what are they
sayin I'm gonna see what floatplane chat
saying I actually I'm just loading it up
now so I'm gonna miss out on anything
they said before but why don't you go
first
explain to me why this thing is not cool
and you know what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go up I'm gonna I'm gonna adjust
the can I'm gonna give them a better
look at it while you love you talk us
through one second so I guess first of
all does it have an always-on display so
first of all any watch that doesn't have
always-on display looks stupid it's just
like this dead thing on your arm that is
it has no utility as a watch and just
should not be there so second of all the
screen it kind of looks like is it
vision that has the stupid goggles like
that yeah I do hate vision vision is the
worst character and he should just he
was the worst part of everything that
he's ever been in so there you go and I
was really happy because then I just
didn't have to worry we can talk about
him and his work crappy plot Avenger
later laughing but anyway it's okay so I
should clarify that on the normal watch
face there's not really much purpose for
it but when you're reading a message for
example you can you have so much more
display available to you like display
for days but why well so you can read
more at a time without scrolling so you
can read a longer message I guess so
yeah and you can do so see I would make
the argument that it would look a lot
dumber
if you had a big round display versus a
wraparound display yeah but like those
are two really dumb things so I don't
know I can't really put into words why I
think it's ugly cuz like ultimately
beauty is in the eye of the beholder can
we just make a straw poll is it ugly
no no yes you know what's going to
happen if we straw poll it don't you
know okay then just drop all it Oh weird
is the wrong title yes do you know take
it to the people you guys see what they
think
this kind of looks I don't know it just
looks wrong it looks like a watch that
got ran over by a car okay
all right well I will I'm gonna make my
counter-argument here and if you'd
really like yes we can also John Oh
wants me to pimp the merch we'll get to
it John release sales team is like
getting too big for their britches and
they run the place these days
does it look okay does it look cool
that's gonna be the question yes no and
improve spam prevention okay all right
I'm gonna post it to floatplane first
and then we'll follow up with YouTube
here I'm gonna vote I'm voting YES and
you're gonna have to go vote for
yourself if you want to vote for oh wow
there's I am CAPTCHA not going to even
bother voting I have so much confidence
in the people just telling you that it's
horrid remember to these are like
high-tech people I know but like okay
thank you thank you people I miss this
screen you know what if only 27 percent
of people think something's cool I would
make the argument that that's pretty
cool this is 27% of a segment that
already is way more likely to be on your
side yes and no they always cite again
me you know that the audience and maybe
he'll raise issue all you always talk
like oh these companies they have to
really go in there and like fix their
image and you're here everyone is voting
against you - okay so is it that I do a
poor job of maintaining my image or is
it that I do a great job of building up
the in I consider that a victory how
because this is this is something
groundbreaking okay look if you take the
average person watching a tech stream
okay and you show them one of those
outfits off of like a Paris fashion
runway right do you think 30 percent of
people are gonna like it do you think
they're all gonna be wearing some
derivative of it okay what about okay
well take this instead concept this
shirt this shirt also this shirt do you
think they've rooted to vote on that
that's seventy percent of people would
say no it's bad no but this would you
suggest people go out and get it okay
now hold on to be clear the question
isn't whether people should go by this
or not the answer to that is 100% clear
no they shouldn't this is nowhere near
ready for primetime I just think that
there's a lot of potential here and I
think it looks cool looks cool in like a
nerdy what okay fine here's where we can
validate your credibility here a little
bit okay do you think calculator watches
are cool yes yes I do I am okay then
you're actually fairly credible you're
wearing one yes I am wearing one right
now no way okay
I swear to you this was not staged I had
no idea why are you wearing a calculator
watch because it's really thin that's
like the main selling point it's nice
and thin sure can go right over it
you could wear anything that would be
thin I don't know I think they're kind
of cool
and so like that's what you're up
against your butt up against someone
that really likes calculator watches
that's telling you that your tech watch
looks dumb hold on a second let's take
it a little more mainstream let's go out
to let's go out to the YouTube audience
and see what they think of it okay I'm
gonna post it in the YouTube guys hit me
it help me out here all right please
help me out is is the Nubia Alpha cool
does it look cool not is it cool it's
not cool it's a bad time but okay I
don't like this okay come on YouTube
come on YouTube it's holding pretty
steady actually I'm surprised it is
holding pretty steady here at 70 30 oh
they're probably no one's to the spam
rejection yet I still think there's room
for it to be a commercial success even
if only thirty percent of people think
it's cool because my other argument for
how many people need to think something
is cool in order for it to be cool is
like high school if you had 30 percent
of your class on board with anything
would that probably be not a not a like
a simple majority but the largest of the
factions majority what would that be
like that the mode or the yeah the mode
I'm pretty sure that if 30 percent of
high schoolers we're wearing that you
would have teen pregnancy just plummet
it always comes back to whether you're
getting laid with you doesn't it alright
fine why don't we jump into an actual
news talk now that I have been summarily
defeated Apple is canceled or not as
canceled is canceled I was gonna say is
canceling or has canceled I'm gonna go
with has canceled its official Apple has
canceled air power were you even
following this kind of I had forgotten
about it
I had honestly completely forgotten
about it I was like oh that sounds
pretty cool and then I completely forgot
about it so for those of you who forgot
about Apple air power basically it was a
three device charging pad that had three
spots on it so you could charge your ear
pods your Apple watch and your iPhone so
it was like the accessory for people who
must have every Apple accessory and
basically they said after much effort so
this is their senior vice president Dan
Ricci oh I tried
after much effort we've concluded air
power will not achieve our high
standards we have canceled the product
we apologize to those customers who are
looking forward to this launch we
continue to believe that the future is
Wireless and are committed to push the
wireless experience forward all right so
this was way back in at the iPhone 10 s
launch know at the iPhone 10 launch I
think in September 2017 yeah and then
they removed it from their website in
September 2018 during the 10 s launch
and we don't actually presently know
exactly what was causing problems but
there is some speculation that because
it was it used a trio of charging coils
utilized a series of cooperative flux
generators to charge the device after
locating it on the pad and software and
this might have led to complications in
design and manufacture I also saw some
speculation that it was regularly
regulatory issues that were making it
difficult to get approval for it so like
maybe there were concerns about just how
much wireless power was going on I mean
you put too many flux generators in you
know one room and you might have you
know was probably really inefficient
point 21 gigawatts something yeah that
is it that is it that is an interesting
factor because like it's pretty
inefficient anyway when you have
everything lined up yeah and if you're
just putting everything there like willy
nilly and then using software it's
probably really inefficient that's
actually interesting that makes a ton of
sense so if they would have had too much
waste heat because when you're charging
three devices and of course no one's
gonna be content with
wireless charging anymore yeah so that
iPhone 10s or like 10s max that's on
there somewhere people are gonna expect
at least like 8 to 10 watt charging off
that thing mm-hmm
yeah that could potentially lead to a
ton of waste heat and it could be
failure issues so basically it sounds
like they did the math and they just
couldn't make it make sense all right
I mean I'm sure we're gonna see some
kind of wireless power in the future
there's certainly other options but
bummer
well guess there's one topic that I want
to discuss oh okay I don't have anything
else we just used it as it's too bad
okay so here's the thing people often
assume that we're somehow very anti
Apple because our thumbnails are often
like that ball something won't you want
to know why people click it Tech linked
tech linked was where we learned that
just putting something about Apple in
the thumbnail basically means that you
have effectively like increased your
potential audience by at least 30% so of
the five most watched episodes of tech
linked ha no one's buying iPhones I'm
almost sad for Apple Apple's getting
desperate and Apple's big fu to China of
the top five and the other one is EA
killing Playstations which was going to
be very popular and so it's just it's
one of those bizarre things where it's
like I don't know why it works
I don't truly I truly don't understand
why people care as much as they do about
everything that Apple does like their
their recent services news event did you
watch it
nope me neither but I did definitely
read some some recent yep and it was
just it was such a nothing burger we're
launching a video streaming service
okay yet another bloody thing to have
yet another monthly subscription for I'm
excited about this
why is Netflix really not keeping up and
if they aren't is Amazon Prime really
not filling the void
what about is YouTube all the many
hundreds of thousands of hours of
YouTube content that get created every
day it's probably millions by this point
but like you can oh you have crave TV Oh
crave TV alright um crave TVs horrible
yeah anyway oh and then there's HBO like
I'm just kind of looking at it going is
there actually a shortage of video
streaming services Disney has theirs
coming so like and then a game pass for
like mobile games the problem with
mobile games is not that they cost money
the problem with mobile games is that
you have to pay to win and also just the
interface is normally kind of bad well
yeah there's that too of course but like
but I'm looking at this going what
mobile games are people actually maybe
I'm missing something on that one please
please let me know let me feel like part
of it might just be playing mobile games
like when's the last time that you've
played a mobile game um I played a bunch
of head ball a little while back they
reached out about sponsoring a video and
I was just like let's see if this is any
good like I hadn't even heard of it
before and I was like let's just see if
this is any good and I sunk like
probably 30 or 40 hours into it in the
next few weeks until I was just like I
and uninstall clearly I cannot have this
yeah I don't remember the last time that
I played a mobile game does the switch
count probably no this which is not a
mobile game the switches Nintendo so
like yeah totally different
I played bike race like five years ago
okay so maybe you're just the wrong
maybe you're just not the target
audience for this then yeah like is that
a fair thing to say that is pretty fair
yeah I don't know so
if you had played a mobile game recently
though one thing I can say is you'd be
blown away by the way that you're just
bombarded with like please buy the
optional items please buy more playtime
please get skins get skins get skins oh
there's a special offer on skins like it
it really does feel exactly like that
like it's like it's all over your field
of vision and it's like uncomfortable
and you're like please move away like
you want it to lift up your hands and be
like push my my hands away and but but
no it's just it's there it's in your
face and so if there was some way for
them to fix that aspect of mobile gaming
sure yeah that's nice yeah I could get
into that and if maybe if that's their
long-term plan is to encourage game
developers to move away from these
pay2win models by making their games
more lucrative to have people just plain
normally through this service then you
know what maybe maybe that is a huge
deal we should all be that excited it
just doesn't really sound like that
right now actually just speaking of
horrible monetization I have to give
apex legends just mad props for how like
non-invasive it is in your face cuz I
played pub G recently and was just like
oh my god this is horrible and I paid
for this and basically every other
free-to-play game that I've ever played
has been horrible and you just kind of
ignore it but a FX legends got it
and I hope that everyone else just kind
of follows there or or or maybe they're
just gonna wait play the waiting game
and it'll just creep its way in creep
its way in cuz here's the thing well but
it's already there it can make its way
it can become more intrusive yeah
because here's the thing if they're
looking at it going okay we're making 1
billion dollars a month or whatever like
the kinds of numbers these these
free-to-play games - it's just
incredible to me so we're doing like you
know a billion dollars a month on you
know 3 billion impressions you know
where they three million times like
putting it in front of you if we do six
billion impressions we could make
two billion dollars a month you don't
think that'll be tempting at some point
true yeah now that I say that pub G had
none of that at launch and now it's just
because the thing is like at a certain
point the there's there's almost no
drawback to selling out because the
developers of pub G have now made so
much money that nothing else they ever
do ever matters at least at the very top
of the food chain that is true if they
never succeed again it doesn't matter
they already won the game they can
literally go out and buy a new Ferrari
every week for the rest of their lives
if that's what makes them happy and just
crush the old one in a crushinator and
that's how they get their jollies thank
you so fun they can actually no it
wouldn't
oh yeah I would never do that I think
you know the thing like those supercar
companies they're very protective of
their brand I think they would start
refusing to sell you cars mm-hmm if you
made a habit of publicly destroying them
it would also just be so bad now that's
the kind of thing that would be
interesting to find out for sure very
expensive to find out for sure like how
many how many Ferraris can you buy
before they stop selling them to you
like what are you doing with Ferraris
probably one last Lambo I think you get
away with like a lot more yeah well I
know that deadmau5 had a bunch of issues
with Ferrari like they didn't even want
him to put his stupid yank at skin on it
or something like that I was like really
like you're idiots but that I think that
was just that dealer wasn't it I don't
think that was actually Ferrari HQ I
don't know I don't know people get
people get really wrapped up in brands
in a way that I find very confusing spin
oh speaking of brands yeah we should do
our sponsors starting with the LTT store
for the first time ever we are actually
doing a discount code on the Linus tech
tip store so that's ltte store calm
it is $10 off orders over $50 and this
is really exciting we now have as of I
think about a week or two ago I haven't
been talking about it too much just
because we've we weren't really sure how
great it was and I didn't want to
oversell it but we now have much lower
shipping rates and I've seen even people
in Europe reporting that they're getting
shipping rates under $10 yeah no it's
it's like way better than it was before
and we just launched a new series of
shirts called Elemental so you can get
the whole pack of them I think how do
you buy the elemental pack oh okay I
don't know if we have the elemental pack
but at any rate so that's this shirt it
isn't a bunch of different sizes so yeah
there's a bunch of different colors
we've got orange and blue and green oh
we've got them here and red so that's
the green one alex has got the blue one
anyway we've got new shirts
we of course have the tech link shirt
people are super into the tech link
classic this is selling shockingly well
it looks cool I like it it's just really
clean like people don't have to know
what tech linked is to appreciate it
that's something that we're really
trying to get away from in a lot of the
designs yeah it was like what's - tech
tips who's Linus like you don't want
people asking you questions like that or
if you do you can buy this one or this
one actually this one moves really well
to our top seller though constellations
you like by a country mile
constellations out sells all circuit
boards combined but I think circuit
board overall is quite close to
constellations or out sells it then
we've got our cable ties we're gonna be
adding more and more stuff over the next
little bit circuit board my personal
favorite is this one oh we also have I
love this one
the LTX lanyard here oh that's not for
sale but well if you go to LTX you'll
get one cool yeah so that's pretty cool
yeah anyway guys go check it out so
we're doing an offer
I think the plan was to be able to buy
the entire elemental set for some price
but I don't know maybe that got kicked
in the head somewhere along the line
Oh also sponsoring today's show is
private Internet access with private
Internet access you can browse the
internet privately without snoops
keeping their eye on what you're doing
P ia supports a wide variety of VPN
protocols and types of encryption and
authentication and allows you to dial in
the exact level of privacy protection
you need and if you're European you're
probably gonna need it sooner than you
think with article 11 and article 13
looking like they are going to come
through you're gonna want to pretend
that you are not in the EU in the event
that services and/or media that you want
to consume end up needing to cut off
access to European users in order to
avoid the restrictive and onerous
obligations that the EU is placing on
them in terms of copyrighted content so
I'll go check it out at LM GGG / p ia
when get a get a head start on all that
stuff and start using a VPN today with P
ia you can log in up to five devices at
the same time so that's your phone your
laptop your desktop your Essos desktop
your Essos phone like it's fantastic
fantastic they've got like a thousand
servers in like 30 countries or
something like that this is awesome and
we have a new sponsor have you ever
heard of this that's actually like
pretty cool oh yeah
they're behind us so this plate is a
magnet mounted metal print poster
they're durable and you don't need any
power tools to hang it they've got over
260,000 different arts spanning a bunch
of different styles and influences and
with their easy magnetic mounting
there's no holes in the wall and it's
easily replaceable they plant ten trees
for every display that gets purchased in
this weekend through our link below you
can use code Shazam
to save 30% if you're watching you're
hearing this on Monday bummer for you
you can use code ltte to save 15% oh so
you got to be you got to be a live win
show
sure in order to get the the best of
this that's straight I can't tell it's
not straight I don't think so yeah
protective leaf one you so lady put your
magnet thing on there yeah you know what
fine
I didn't it alright okay actually I want
to give them a better look at OWA
stealin though looks pretty cool so if
you want some arts for your walls very
straightforward just a metal sheet
that's quality actually looks really
good this one like the printing that's
not a hundred percent sure but we'll
call that good enough
so that's LM GG g / displayed when we've
got that right there alright now I'm
sure we had some other topics you had
something you wanted to talk about yes
hit me so people get mad at us when we
flame things that are fundamentally
pretty good and so I just kind of wanted
to cuz we both had videos in like the
past week where this happened yeah yeah
actually you know what's really funny is
I actually had some notes for myself to
address that I think in in an upcoming
video huh not a not a dedicated release
so like yeah I'll talk about it all now
but I think I was gonna talk about it in
my in my Huawei P 30 pro video actually
yeah go ahead though go please well
we're just thinking like what was yours
though the HP x 360 the spectre x360
yeah yeah cuz like I'd probably give
that if we like gave things scores which
i think is a terrible idea
yeah like 87% probably me yeah that's an
a really 87% yeah it's not quite a 90
with that with that motion blur on the
display
I was thinking of the 13-inch but okay
what about the other one because that
display was unacceptable it has other
display options I don't know okay fine
so the shell yeah okay but the potential
machine that you could buy you'd say
it's an a Loa yeah okay my god and we
basically yeah we completely destroyed
it you know the whole thing our poor HP
rep said I'm sorry you hated it
yeah so much even though look at I I
wouldn't say that I hated it it's pretty
good it's just worse than everything
else right and then my recent one that
you're probably thinking of I think is
the s10 yes that right so my issue with
the s10 was not that it was a terrible
phone and at no point did I say it was a
terrible phone in fact if you wait till
the end and we know that a great large
percentage of you don't if you were to
wait to the end you would hear that the
conclusion is it's superfast Hardware on
Samsung's best software experience ever
and if you buy it you'll be pretty happy
with it the reason that I went to town
on it was that the problem that I had
with it the hole punch display was
completely avoidable and is done there
was just no reason to do that and the
funny thing about it for mine was that
in particular I got accused of being
paid off by Apple or Huawei to criticize
the Samsung S 10 plus when in fact the
phone that I compared it to most was the
note 9 my daily driver that I don't hide
that I'm actually a samsung daily carry
user I and that Samsung tried to release
an upgrade to my phone and I didn't
upgrade to it because I don't like it
better that's what happened and so it
was I did get one thing wrong in the
video so I mistakenly referred to the
depth sensor on the front as an
additional camera it's actually a depth
sensor oops
we have
a weird relationship with Samsung where
because we're Canadian we don't really
deal with the same PR reps and agencies
and we don't deal directly with
Samsung's main office for North America
which is in the u.s. so we can actually
get a device but it's often later than
anyone else gets it and we don't get the
same level of briefing materials that
other people do occasionally I miss
things that's something that there's no
excuse because it was covered by
third-party media before but it's just
like okay sorry I tried and the other
thing too was that I came out
criticizing the ultrasonic fingerprint
sensor I'm I'm still critical of it do I
have no this is my note 9 in my pocket
with debrand skin now grip rather so the
other thing was the fingerprint sensor
so just as just for a sanity check today
as I was working on my PC Pro review I
pulled out the s10 Plus that I used for
my review and I did acknowledge in the
video since this thing I did acknowledge
in the video that with the software
update it got a lot better but I pulled
it out and I just played this game I
played the game where I unlock both of
them side by side and it's gonna help
him prove it I'm gonna see if that so a
couple things I'm not hating on it it's
better than having it on the back of the
phone that's for darn sure
that's something I was always against
what I'm saying is that it's not as good
as other options in the market
furthermore I never said I had trouble
when my hands were wet I said it was
inconsistent when my skin was dry
well I guess that's kind of the problem
with like ultrabooks and phones like
there's a bunch of them and they're all
very good so if you're like taking a
laptop and going head-to-head with like
the Microsoft Surface laptop yeah and
the MacBook Pro you have to be as good
as those and if it's just something like
even if the trackpad wasn't bad on the
HP the screen was wobbly enough that I
still would have just hated it and that
that's enough when you're going up
against like the MacBook Pro and the
surface laptop if the screen just
wobbles a bit while you type no no you
don't want it if you're a few hundred
dollars cheaper then there's a lot more
room for for me to say okay but you save
a bunch of money I mean that's where
someone like oneplus comes in and a ton
of points honestly they're not cheap
anymore they're not a flagship killer
anymore
but what they are is significantly
cheaper than a Samsung if you're samsung
and you're releasing literally the most
expensive phone on the market every once
in a while with your Note series and
your S series it's just a higher
standard they're just there just isn't
room for you to have a fundamental
problem like a wobbly display and in the
case of the HP laptops they were very
expensive
they were priced comparably to machines
that didn't have the problems so here's
the thing if it was a score absolutely
we could give it an A we could give
everything in a quite frankly between a
companies the size of Dell and HP rarely
engineer something that is C - and I'm
not saying it doesn't happen I'm just
trying to think of the last thing that
we had in here that wouldn't have gotten
an A but when it comes to whether or not
to buy it's a fairly binary choice you
either do buy or don't buy and sometimes
we can make an argument for a certain
customer to buy and a certain other
customer not to buy like in the case of
something like a Quadro graphics card if
you're a gamer
to buy if you're a professional you know
Salt Lake works user the Alienware
area51 app sure that thing is awesome I
recommend it to people with lots of
money and that need a desktop
replacement there
it's a qualified yes to buy but if
you're in the awkward situation where
there's someone who does everything you
do well a little better than you at the
same price or lower then that becomes a
not to buy for anyone and so it ends up
getting well it ends up getting beat up
a little bit and hopefully they do
better next time
it ends up getting just nitpicked yeah
and I guess we'll get mad about that
because it's like it's not a big issue
yeah and I've seen a lot of comments
lately like you guys are spoiled you
just hate everything but it's not it's
not about that our job is to hate
everything not hate it but but tell you
the things that we did notice that are
not as good as something else like our
entire job is to make it so that you buy
the right thing instead of the wrong
thing and I mean honestly here's here's
a question for you is the role of the
technology reviewer dying the
traditional role of helping people make
the correct decision before they buy is
that fading away would you like me to
make my argument a little bit further
before you answer yes yeah so 1020 years
ago it was pretty commonplace at the
local electronics boutique your Radio
Shack mm-hmm for certain big-ticket
items to basically be buy once don't
return yes so later on with the advent
of your big box stores it did get easier
to return items but speaking from
personal experience if you do it too
much the staff do get to know who you
are they you know avoid you when you
walk in the door look there was a thing
once where we did Eyefinity with TVs at
NCIX
and because we didn't want to open up
our own TVs they actually sent me to the
local future shop to buy three TVs and
then back to the local future shop to
return them and I was like well I want
to do this video so I guess that's what
I'm doing today
anyway anyway anyway so thanks to online
retail and very generous return policies
we've actually had issues so some of the
some of the phones that we've put on our
eBay store for example not some of every
hey Tyler she's still here
I've Tyler told me a little while ago
that every single phone that we had ever
listed got returned not because it was
broken or anything just because people
were test driving them and so thanks to
online purchasing now everyone has
access to a product the whole concept of
going to a store to see something that's
another thing at a store you're less
likely to have to return it because
theoretically you can try it right there
in person but with online everyone has
access to every product and with these
generous return policies you can just
take things for a test drive for a
couple of weeks and send them back do
you really need me to tell you if it's
any good you can find out for yourself
if you're shameless enough to just buy
things and return them until you're
happy I know that a prime probably
bought like six phones at one point when
he was upgrading ten Oh until eventually
deciding on what that what does he what
does he care you know Nexus or something
I don't know whatever like Nexus that
doesn't make any sense
Pixley there's no way he landed with a
pixel three I'm curious I'm curious now
anyway so with that with all that
background information is there as the
role of the technology reviewer changing
and/or dying no because with that HP
like the spectre x360 someone would have
bought it and they would have been like
this is really great and they would have
enjoyed using it and they wouldn't have
unless they also had like the XPS 13 and
the surface laptop if they'd already had
those and returned them then they'd see
that it's not great but if they just buy
it they
like this is fantastic yay okay that's a
pretty good argument
no.9 yeah okay okay I can see that I
also saw a comment on here we go on
YouTube where someone said okay that's a
fair point but it's actually a lot more
work to buy something shiet for yourself
switching phones all the time is a real
hassle it's actually one of the reasons
I've done very few phone reviews over
the last six months I just got like
really tired it's a pain in the butt I
hate it but anyway yeah I can see that
but if it's something that you care
enough about then I think that it's
probably worth the time investment to
make sure you get the right one and I
guess maybe that's something where I've
noticed that a lot there's a lot more
tech press attention on more mainstream
products from people who might not care
enough to like passionately you know
look into every aspect of something in
those two weeks like someone who has
that kind of time to even spend on it
within the return window you know maybe
maybe among more mainstream categories
those people are fewer and further
between further farther between so it's
it's like the the motherboards and stuff
where where those people don't need
reviews as much and then maybe in mobile
they still do need them I don't know
like I'm speculating at this point but
yeah I don't know I think I think
there's certainly a case to be made that
these days it basically comes down to
you can kind of get access to anything
to try it in in North America anyway
there are certainly parts of the world
where it's much more difficult and the
role of the technology reviewer is more
like to be like a trusted adviser and
maybe less critical should we be less
critical
should we strawpoll it sure yeah why not
let's draw pull it I don't know but I
don't know I would much rather spend
like an evening watching 20 phone
reviews than dealing with getting a
phone like it takes more time to just
set up your phone than to watch the
reviews for all the flagships
and also like I find a lot of the time I
just don't care
like I switched to the iPhone 10's a
little while ago from the pixel and was
just like okay it sort of annoyed me I
probably would have slightly destroyed
it in the review but at the same time
it's fine after a week yup whatever I
don't care yeah I I get accused a lot of
being a fanboy of Android or iOS at this
point honestly if the iPhone had a
headphone jack I would still use it
interchangeably we'll get to that in a
moment I would still use it
interchangeably with an Android flagship
like it makes very little difference to
me I just really do prefer wired
headphones for the reasons we talked
about earlier on the show like for me if
it comes down to I just don't really
even care I'm actually gonna give the
p30 pro a really positive review though
huh nice do you wanna know why why not
because the camera is hands-down the
best there's still some work to do on
the colorscience
and there's like there's a thing the
Excel mark is not the be-all and end-all
yeah because for me a camera phone or a
phone camera camera phone haha it used
to be a thing because there were phones
without cameras so for me a phone camera
is really down to capture the moment
yeah quickly because if I really wanted
you know the best possible footage of it
I'd go get the red that I literally so
this is about making sure I don't miss
something
and for me what this does so well is
because of that zoom lens it means that
if I get yeah oh man it automatically
switched to portrait mode no no no no no
okay he's moving around a lot so because
of that zoom lens if I get a bad seat
case moving around if I could have gotta
see that the kids like recital or
something I can now capture a moment
that I otherwise wouldn't be able to and
that's a huge difference maker for me
even if I have run into some situations
where
I I did find that I would have rather
had a pixel three or or an iPhone as
that is what swayed me back to the pixel
from the iPhone was just right I found
the camera wasn't as consistently using
8nr though right
tennis tennis really okay I was like I
found that if I just like took it and
like took a picture of a mountain it
would be the same if not better yeah but
if I'm just like whipping it up my
pocket and it's like someone walking I
could use like and the pixel gets it
more often and a creepy well no that is
a creepy way to put it like it really is
you know if like dennis is like falling
down the stairs i'm work likely to
capture that okay fair enough
so let's go ahead and show the
floatplane results here while i go ahead
and post our post our straw poll in
YouTube and then maybe Nick can sorry
Nick
I I've been ignoring you okay so I'm
posting that there I'm bringing the
results up here so overwhelmingly plain
says we should not be less critical
you should not okay Nick what can I do
for you all the YouTube results come in
I wonder so where the bundle is oh yeah
I was a little curious yeah it's dead
sorry it's dead oh we can't do the
bundle with the with the store right now
store and apps okay so there's no bundle
for now
so that's but there's a discount code
ten orders in ten minutes that's like
one order per minute Wow I'm not
ignoring you I'm just not talking to you
have a great weekend see ya oh wow it's
like quarter after six are you in the
carpool today no oh okay well at least
I'm not keeping more than one person
after hours then so the YouTube audience
is pretty much on the same page yeah
okay so what is crushing we're gonna
keep being critical so I don't know
where these outliers that are
slamming us for being mean to things
that they like are coming from maybe
they don't watch man show are these just
like the drive-by non-subscribed people
like I don't look at actually had a bit
of a theory about this okay kind of a
Bruin okay share it with me sure because
on floatplane people that do like bad
comments get flamed like they I've never
seen a community where people that like
typing first get absolutely destroyed
like they do on float planes okay yeah
and it's the same with just like general
questions like stuff will go through
where people will be very critical of us
and they will get a lot of up votes but
if people are like critical in a like
kind of dickish way they will get
downloaded just because they're being a
jerk
yeah well that's one of the things that
really does stand out about floatplane
is it's a much more constructive comment
session and so I'm thinking like on
YouTube you pretty much only see the
ones that are voted up mm-hmm and so
even if like four out of five people see
that and they're like that's dumb and
would have downloaded it they can't so
then it just goes up and then people are
still commenting so that gives it more
exposure and that more people are
hitting like that like one in five
people so even though it's like the
third top comment yeah and YouTube is
also lunch could disagree with this much
greater sampling sample size so even if
only 1% of people feel that way yeah
that's still 10,000 people and that's
probably how like extraordinaire Olli
dumb comments right rise to the top even
when like the second and third reply are
like no clearly like they said in the
video why they are doing this or
something like that right what you are
just wrong um
oh speaking of things that are just that
are very negative negative comments if
you ever thought to yourself I'm gonna
post this in floatplane first so you
guys get the first crack at this if you
ever thought to yourself you know what I
would love to attend is a roast of one
Linus g Sebastian
it's empty oh right the sponsor for the
roast yeah that's right if you've ever
wanted to attend a roast of me now is
your chance for about 80 people in the
Vancouver area if you can be here next
Friday Friday right yeah next Friday you
will be able to attend in the evening
the roast of yours truly we have
confirmed celebrity guests J's $0.02
Kyle from what's he call himself now a
bit wet yeah Kyle from Big Oil sorry
Carla from loyal from ya wild Lyle from
Kyle from Lyle from so we've got Kyle
from bit wit and then we've also got
Steve from gamers nexus who are gonna be
part of the dais we've also got some of
our own staff here at LMG who will be
roasting me it's gonna be fun and we
also your wife she will be returning as
well
so guys don't buy a ticket if you can't
actually make it we made them cheap
because we don't this is not a
money-making endeavor it's sponsored by
madrenas they're making this whole thing
possible so it's promoting the LTTE
Lambeau roast they're the coffee roast
so it's a roast of me promoting the
roast and so we wanted we wanted it to
be affordable but we also made it cost
something because we don't want people
buying tickets and not showing up
because that's really really pointless
so I'm gonna go ahead and post this over
on YouTube now the p-block there you go
so good luck I hope to see you guys
there it should be a fun it should be a
fun evening empty seats I blame you guys
that's ridiculous
don't buy a seat if you're not going to
be there but yeah we really hope it's
gonna be a lot of fun we are planning to
livestream it so if you guys do want to
watch the livestream make sure you are
subscribed to ltte over on floatplane
that's where it's going to be there is a
strong possibility that there will be
things in the livestream that will not
make it to the final YouTube release
because like I don't know about some of
the other people but I think Jay is
planning to kind of wing it
so see how that goes yeah
and that'll be a floatplane exclusive
stream by the way I've heard some like
jokes about him too leading up that are
like kind of savage so so yet for those
of you not familiar with the concept of
a roast it's not all going to be
targeted at me necessarily like some of
the some of the dais members can
actually Dyess die stays I don't know
whatever some of the Roasters can roast
each other and stuff I get a chance to
roast them back so it's gonna be it's
gonna be solid fun apparently it's sold
out lol so hopefully we'll see you guys
there we should have made it more
expensive actually I really hope that
people didn't just buy it because it was
only ten bucks and then resell it not
show up well I don't care if they resell
it I just want the seat filled okay yeah
that's the most important thing all
right
well we had actually a couple of other
really good topics so this is
unfortunate oh actually we have to do an
LTI X update okay so like office depot
tricks customers into $300 tech support
with their fake virus scanner it was
actually through support com they were
the ones that were well they
collaborated and the FTC announced that
they have to pay a total of 35 million
in settlements so you got some yeah so
that's good because fake tech support is
a real scam that's really stupid and
basically was a thing where if you check
boxes that was like I think that I might
have a virus it would tell you 100
percent of the time that you have a
virus and then it would recommend up to
a 300 dollar virus removal service for
you at Office Depot so that's really
brutal as found happen on machines that
had fresh installs of Windows yep and no
access to the Internet yeah and they
would get like all the viruses you have
all of them
and apparently staff were even briefed
to make sure that people with new
machines like didn't run it because it
would tell them that they had viruses or
that like once you've run their virus
removal software and not
run their checking if you have viruses
software because it will tell you that
you have irises also Fido is going to
start charging ten dollars for customer
support that could have been done
without calling into customer support it
seems wrong doesn't apply to like asking
about your account bill or how to
complete a transaction through
self-serve and there are exceptions
including for customers and special
needs but basically they're saying look
supporting you costs money so you're
gonna pay for it
it just sounds like you're like a big
ole fu 10 man like Nan's there and she
doesn't know how to go on the self-serve
so she like Kohl's is like hey how could
how do I do this and they're like we can
tell you for a price so well it will
impact quick transactions such as making
a one-time payment or resetting a
voicemail password
and while users can still call in use
live chat or social media services to
make these quick changes they are
generally faster to complete through
fidos website or their interactive voice
systems so they want people to use that
so that they don't have to pay call
center employees cool boy
Rogers other brand chatter launched a
similar feel ass tweak where customers
are charged five dollars when they
complete select transactions or
interactions over the phone with a rep
where two or more self-serve options
exist now okay I have a sort of
controversial take on this mm-hmm
in certain cases I actually do support
service fees for completely unnecessary
bullcrap
if you go to the real human teller to
take out $40 you can kiss my ass because
I have real things to do that actually
require a human you can go use the ABN
please I don't mind them charging
someone three bucks to talk to a human
to deposit cash in their bank account
that's stupid
how does it really annoy me customer
support for something that you already
pay like Canadian Wireless fees are not
cheap that you're already paying through
the nose for and they're healthfully
profitable thankfully these are all
public companies so we
can see if they're just scraping by and
they're not to me this is this is just a
cash grab also the real takeaway here is
you just shouldn't use Rogers in the
first place
share another bad what are your
alternatives tell us and to be clear I
use a ton of Teleservices that doesn't
mean that I haven't had some no
variances your alternatives are Bell
okay ant Ellis yeah i'm both of them
have just way better coverage that's the
only reason just don't get Rogers
because their coverage is garbage
it's like passable here in Nova Scotia
I was yeah but that's cuz they're from
here yeah but like in Nova Scotia it's
it's bad like when I was there it was
like pretty much the entire time it was
just no powers it's just pointless and
in Newfoundland I think they have three
towers for all of Newfoundland right so
like you're it's just not a phone it's
like it's like a brick you might as well
have like a Chinese SIM all right we've
got one more update for you guys LTX
update blah blah blah blah blah blah
come learn how to build a PC deal it a
CPU disassembled GPU updates raisers
Cohen razors showing up oh yeah so they
