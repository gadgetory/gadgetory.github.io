optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more welcome to my unboxing and
overview of what must be the ugliest box
that we have ever encountered here and
not particularly great packaging either
this is the SD 3500 V and it is a lot
more exciting than its ugly box and ugly
packaging would actually indicate so it
is a dock and you might go oh man really
Linus and I'm like yeah it's a dog
so what docks are good for is expanding
well okay what docks were traditionally
used for was notebooks would have like
these proprietary connectors on the
bottom of them and then you'd like plug
them into these docks and you'd get a
bunch of extra i/o well nowadays docks
are a little bit different so this one
right here uses a single USB 3
connection so there it is right there on
the back USB 3 and it adds a butt ton of
i/o to your ultra book HDMI DVI Ethernet
and 4 USB 2.0 ports so why do we need
this and the answer is well because
notebooks have just completely forgotten
about IO so this notebook right here is
a 15 point 4 inch model from Vizio it's
super slim super sexy and has super HDMI
out and 2 USB 3 ports and that is it it
is incredibly frustrating to not be able
to plug in like almost anything to it at
a time by the time you plug in a mouse
and like a USB Drive you can't plug in
your card reader and then you you just
kind of stuck so this one adds all of
that more like permanently attached i/o
at the back so you can walk in plug in
the single USB 3 B cable so it looks a
little something like this then you plug
in that single cable to your notebook
and then you'll have all this i/o on the
back so your keyboard and mouse and
peripherals can all be already set up
and it actually adds 2 USB 3 SuperSpeed
ports on the front it should be noted
guys remember this
is not made of magic so there's a single
five gigabit per second connection to
your PC so everything here is going to
be sharing it so if you were to hammer
everything at the same time it would
slow down but there's two USB 3 ports at
the front as well as front panel
headphones and microphone in which can
be another frustrating thing about many
ultrabooks these days is that they're
using those is the headphone microphone
combo jack so if you don't happen to
have a device and you don't happen to
have an adapter or that's inconvenient
for you then you can go ahead and do
this so there you go guys
multi monitor output it comes with some
adapters and stuff I guess so you can
you have to plug it into power because
there's a bunch of stuff in there
including a USB to Ethernet bridge as
well as a USB sound card as well as a
USB to video adapter and it comes with a
couple of other adapters as well so
depending on what kind of outputs you
have on your notebook it'll allow you to
it oh cool it comes with a DVI to HDMI
adapter those are handy and then it also
comes with a DVI to vga adapter so
depending on what all you've got going
on in terms of your external peripherals
you should be able to plug in pretty
much whatever you want is this the only
device that does this thing the answer
is no it's not in fact there are many
devices that do this Kensington just
happened to send us one and since we've
never unboxed anything like this before
I was like okay yeah sure by the way
this is a pierced ubi dvi-i which is
great that means you can even plug into
a VGA monitor if your computer again
modern slim laptops just HDMI which has
no analog pins inside it can be very
handy thank you for checking out my
unboxing an overview of the 3,500 V from
Kensington don't forget to subscribe -
tech tips from unboxings reviews and

nice heft to it so it shouldn't just
