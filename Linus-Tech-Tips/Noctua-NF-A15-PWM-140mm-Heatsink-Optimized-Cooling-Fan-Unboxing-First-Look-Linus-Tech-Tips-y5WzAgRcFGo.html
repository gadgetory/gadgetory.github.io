out of necessity going to be fairly
quick I'm trying to get this fan on a
heatsink so that I can test the thermal
right Silver Arrow with an alternate fan
configuration now before I take it off
the CPU and swap it out for something
else so I've already talked a fair bit
about naktu as NFA 14 which is a square
frame 140 millimeter fan ideal for
radiators and case fan and sort of all
kinds of different applications this
guy's got 140 millimeter holes on a 140
millimeter frame its pressure optimized
so it's good for all those applications
this is the f12 which is very similar
except see that cool stuff going on
there it is a focused flow fan so it's
ideal for spot cooling it's ideal for
radiators heat sinks anything that
requires a 120mm fan with 120 mil
mounting holes this guy right here is a
140 millimeter frame with 150 millimeter
width however it's still 140 millimeter
blades and 120 millimeter mounting holes
which makes it ideal for mounting on
coolers like this where you could
benefit see this is there's one already
on here which means you can benefit from
the larger blade see in there you can
see the blades are like all the way the
entire width of the entire heatsink now
but mount with 120 millimeter holes so
check this out guys ideal for 140
millimeter CPU coolers tons of
technology there flow acceleration
channels aao frames depth Inlet design
inner surface micro structures
integrated anti-vibration pads custom
design pwm IC with SC d basically these
are the most over designed fans you can
get yeah pretty much so there's like
flow acceleration channels which
increase efficiency and the increase in
speed achieved through the float leads
to significantly reduced flow separation
which permits lower vortex noise and
higher air flow efficiency these guys
are all about having quiet operating
products sso to barring extremely high
quality barring completely sealed so
it's not going to get dust and junk in
it over time also comes with a six year
warranty and the stepped Inlet design is
actually on the edge of the fence here
I'll just show it to you on one of the
other fans you see the stepped inlets
here has something to do with breaking
up the flow that comes in making it
quieter and more efficient there's
if ball-like dimples in here that just
generally make the fan more better I've
been a huge Noctua fan hahahaha for a
long time now this guy right here spins
at 1200 RPM or 900 RPM with the included
low noise adapter it's going to be so
quiet at 1200 rpm I don't see much point
quieting it down but I mean it still
performs very well with the low noise
adapter you can see there's a
significant drop in static pressure so
if you are using it in the heatsink
application you may want to use it that
way
it's exceeds the award-winning NFP 14
which is the NFP 12 140 millimeter
version so this is even better than that
guy and incorporates a lot of the
technology that we saw introduced with
the NFF 12 which was like a huge step
forward in fan design even for Noctua
around 140 off low acceleration china AO
frame aha advanced acoustic optimization
frames feature integrated anti-vibration
pads as well as mock to us that's the
stepped Inlet so this is just branding
for multiple things that we've already
talked about before the inter surface
micro structures those little things I
showed you before in there are to reduce
the blade passing noise and improve air
flow and pressure efficiency and the
improved anti-vibration pads I'll show
you in a minute here
high-end PWM circuitry is circuitry is
very important it makes it more
compatible with third party coolers also
reduces the amount of just sort of
random IC noise that it makes and yeah
it's just generally better the fan
itself comes with an extension cable
which you'll see you'll you may need in
a moment because it comes with a very
short cable comes with a Y splitter okay
that's handy so single four pin pwm to
dual four pin PWM okay needy meaty neat
neat neat neato
oh yeah low speed adapter low noise
adapter and low speed adapter it does
both things mounting screws although you
probably won't want to use those because
it comes with rubber noise isolating by
anti vibration mounts so check this out
this is a very unique looking fan sorry
use the camera to get the fan out so
check this out looks looks kind of
bizarre right see it's got those those
these are the rubber anti vibration
mounts that are integrated these are the
120 millimeter mounting holes on a 140
millimeter by 100
50 millimeter frame very very
strange-looking design but you can see
why this is why I wanted to have one of
them mounted already before I even
started doing the unboxing because you
can see here that if we mounted it this
way see that these pieces wouldn't get
to touch the heatsink so you wouldn't
get to take advantage of any of the anti
vibration if you use the fans that were
included with this cooler which you can
see have a very similar design with the
120 mil holes in the 140 millimeter
blades you again don't get to leverage
any anti vibration anything because
there's no room on a frame this size to
build that in so that is why not - it
did this so that they could put the fan
in like this see that where you get
rubber to metal so that you don't have
any sort of vibration and I've said that
word a lot in the last little bit no
innuendo intended so you don't get any
vibration being passed but you get to
take advantage of the 140 millimeter
blades that can be mounted on 120
millimeter devices now something like
this useless for radiators don't do it
because it'll leak around the edges it's
kind of like Corsairs new SP fans which
are they generate good static pressure
and all that and that's all good but
they leak around the edges of radiator
so there are better solutions such as
the NFF 12s and ya p12 is even so
there's the acceleration notches there's
the stepped Inlet there's the golf-ball
dimples very high-tech stuff these guys
put there's like kind they're kind of
obsessive they're one of those companies
that take something that sort of no one
else really cares that much about and
just kind of obsess over it like who
would I even compare them to like
someone like yeah there's not really
that many guys guys like this they've
really built their brand on building
fans that are ugly but they work it's
like that it's like that cough medicine
tastes awful but it works so there you
go thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the NF a 15
pwm fan from nock to i it is ideal for
heatsink applications don't forget to
