anything else I wanted to try running
Hawks 2 on the AMD fusion III 50 APU so
this is a mini ITX board from gigabyte
featuring the e 350 which is both a CPU
and a GPU it is both in one so I just
want to tell you guys right off the bat
ok so we're only getting about 20 to 30
FPS here and this is running at very low
detail so you can see the aliasing is
fairly evident we're only running at
should I forget what it's like 1024 by
600 red
as long as you don't get you know too
deep into these two as long as you get
don't get too close to the landscape it
may actually be functional hard to say
depends some people have much lower
thresholds than others I personally
wouldn't be able to play it at this kind
of a framerate but it looked a little
bit better before near the beginning I
guess now we're probably running into a
more CPU bottleneck to kind of scenario
than GPU based on all of the planes
falling apart all the effects that are
going on so yeah what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna run it at full details and
just to see what kind of a performance
difference we actually see but first
I'll get you guys the overall benchmark
score here so here's the overall
benchmark score running everything on
low at the lowest possible res supported
by the game in widescreen and all that
good stuff so I'll be back in a moment
with my full quality DirectX 11 results
so just for fun I decided to see you
know forgetting about playable settings
on the e3 50 AMD's fusion APU I decided
for giggles I was going to turn the
details up run this baby at 1080p with
tessellation on no anti-aliasing but
everything else set to high to see what
kind of results we can get in a
legitimate DirectX 11 game at HD
resolution supporting the latest dx11
features like say for example heavy
tessellation that we have going on in
this game so we were able to achieve
eight f PS average
which unfortunately isn't really
playable but you wouldn't be expecting
to run in e350 fusion apu at 1080p with
the highest details than the latest
games anyway so I thought this was an
interesting experiment and thank you for
checking out my video on Hawks to gaming
on the e350 APU</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
