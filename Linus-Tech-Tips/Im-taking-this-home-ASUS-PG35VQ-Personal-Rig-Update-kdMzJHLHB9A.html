here guys so Nvidia just sent over a
Titan r-tx to replace my old Titan X
Maxwell graphics card so that upgrade is
done but I ran into new problem my
predator X 34 is officially holding me
back now with its hundred Hertz refresh
rate fortunately the long-awaited rog
swift PG 35 v is finally here it's a
clear upgrade in every way it's 34 40 by
1440 resolution still but it is one inch
bigger
it's got HDR with g-sync ultimate and it
manages up to 200 Hertz refresh so it is
finally time after a couple years of
this being my reigning gaming monitor of
choice to crack open and upgrade oh that
was not the way to open this but the way
to segue into our sponsor is for me to
tell you about glassware with glassware
you can detect and block badly behaving
apps on your PC or Android device just
head over to glassware we're gonna have
them linked in the video description and
use offer code Lynas to get 25% off
now I do want to get this cracked open
right away but before I do that I should
give you guys a bit of an update on
what's going on with the personal rig so
the old graphics card is still out but
if you guys recall I actually changed
out my CPU and motherboard at the same
time that I put in the Titan RDX except
one small continuity error that's my old
rampage v extreme with my 5960 accident
so there was something I didn't think of
back when I did the upgrade optical
Thunderbolt 3 cables which is what the
new motherboard used don't exist yet so
what I'm doing right now is even though
I have all these cables run here is I'm
actually back to using my Thunderbolt 2
connection with my old motherboard now
as for the reason that I bring all of
that up I left all this stuff in place
because at this point I don't know if my
Thunderbolt 2 connection is going to be
able to carry a display 41.4 signal
which it will need to if it's gonna be
able to do 200 Hertz at 34 40 by 1440 so
the good news is we've got all the
different options whatever works first
impressions right out of the gate here
this thing is really thick to a sous is
credit they've managed to thin up the
bezels quite a bit compared to their 4k
144 Hertz gaming display Oh from this
angle you guys also get a really good
look at the curve that is a tight curve
1,800 are looking not too bad
io wise we've got HDMI but even with
HDMI 2.0 you're still limited to 34 40
by 1440 100 Hertz then we've got
DisplayPort here which is a hundred and
eighty Hertz natively 200 Hertz
overclocked our power in a USB 3 hub and
then that's pretty much it oh except for
this so that is actually a headphone
jack so
notable here is that this is powered by
a higher end amp and DAC than you would
normally find integrated into a monitor
so you can use it a couple ways you can
pass through your audio from HDMI or
DisplayPort just like you normally would
or if you plug in via USB then you get
higher definition audio or whatever the
case may be personally I don't find this
to be a particularly big deal because
from my perspective if you can afford a
$2,500 monitor you can probably also
afford a standalone anthem DAC so for me
I'm using an O 2 headphone amplifier
with the DAC built-in then again the
flip side of it is maybe you spent all
of your money on this $2,500 monitor and
you're very grateful that it has a
better built-in headphone amplification
solution alright now that we've got it
assembled looks like we've got a boat
now let's about like about 4 or 5 inches
of height adjust you know there's your
tilt
here's your swivel and then there's no
no pivot but you do have a little bit of
adjustment just in case your desk is not
quite even we've got an ambient light
sensor on the top so you can disable
that but that can make it so that if
your room lighting conditions change
there it'll adjust the backlight
speaking of back lights there's lights
on the back this is full RGB if you're
into that sort of thing but for me
personally I won't be seeing it so I'm
not sure if I care about that but I do
like having these controls on the back
with the joystick type interface that is
definitely my favorite way to interact
with a monitor all right so let's get
this thing replaced this is a lot
heavier yes that is chunky or what is it
the kids say now chunky it's chunky
apparently this is 280 watt power brick
that's nuts
I've plugged my DisplayPort pass-through
into the back of my graphics card and
I'm pretty sure this isn't gonna work
but hey you know it's worth a shot well
the good news is that the thick cable
works I don't know what what refresh
rate though so I shut down the system
we're gonna try a cold boot swapped out
my standard cable for the one running
through thunderbolt and
we're gonna see if it works at all and
how far it'll go but something you guys
need to keep in mind is that even if it
works perfectly just like their 4k 144
Hertz gaming display this one has some
some gotchas on the maximum resolution
and refresh rate so if you want to run
with no chroma subsampling so full 444
RGB color you're gonna be limited to a
hundred and twenty Hertz if you want 12
bit color a hundred and forty-four Hertz
if you want 10-bit color and 180 Hertz
if you want 8-bit color and of course at
8-bit color you cannot run HDR so the
only way to go to 200 Hertz overclocked
is to run 8-bit color again no HDR then
if you're willing to use chroma
subsampling so that's four to two you
can actually run all the way up to
twelve bit color at 200 Hertz but you're
gonna get that fringing that many people
complained about with the 27 inch 4k 144
Hertz wow this is just not working at
all okay then I guess we're just gonna
have to run this DisplayPort cable and
we're stuck with that then now the thing
about chroma subsampling is that while
you'll notice it on text it's unlikely
that many people will notice it in games
so your mileage may vary it's worth
trying out now okay we've got it fired
up we're kind of looking at it closer
for the first time and it's obvious that
our viewing angles are not quite IPs
like which kind of makes sense because
this is a VA as opposed to an IPS panel
let's go ahead and see how far we can
push B refresh rate with that cable
going to the other room over there let's
go straight to 200 Hertz I guess alright
so I'm seeing a little bit of motion
blur on the trailing and leading edge of
this one
but it's far from the worst I've seen to
its credit even though we're running at
200 Hertz this text is quite readable
even while I'm moving it around now to
make Susan and videos credit actually on
the static text this is at 200 Hertz for
two to twelve bit I can honestly can't
even tell but if I move it see that it
starts to look kind of weird and like
kind of brown and yellow as I move it
around so honestly for myself I think
I'd be far more likely to leave it on
four four four and maybe he try to hit
the 144 Hertz for fresh for that full
quality but still a significant upgrade
in terms of refresh rate over my old one
so now that I've settled on that we can
go ahead and enable HDR which happily
doesn't make windows look like complete
garbage when you're not in games anymore
that's pretty nice and we can go ahead
and fire up steam which is a perfect
opportunity for us to have a look at the
full array local dimming that's present
on this monitor so unlike their previous
4k display which had 384 zones this one
actually has 512 zones and they're all
quite small only about two and a half
centimetres square so what that means is
that as a bright object moves around on
the screen the backlight behind it is
going to brighten and then as dark
object moves around it will darken now
in a synthetic situation like this you
can see that the effect is really not
very convincing and making adjustments
to it like changing it to gradual for
example does not improve the situation
at all it just creates kind of a hazy
smear behind whatever you move around
but the real test is not how it does
moving the mouse around in steam but
rather how it handles actual games
okay so Shadow the Tomb Raider is almost
ready to go which means we can talk
about HDR gameplay now but first well
let's talk about HDR content consumption
so here's a video that was shot in HDR
from our buddy Austin Evans I'm just
going to switch this over to yep there
we go for
hey HDR does it work yeah it definitely
works
so it's vasa HDR 1000 certified which
means it has to be able to do a thousand
its peak brightness in a small area or
as a single flash across the whole
screen and 600 and it's sustained but a
sue says it can actually do 715 it
sustains now as far as just consuming
content on it goes I gotta say the
fuller a local dimming did not bother me
at all as long as I'm viewing it from
directly in front if you go off access
yeah that's a more challenging scenario
and I can definitely see the halos but
straight on it actually looks really
damn good so this is fascinating I was
having a game launching issue and I
wanted to force close steam and check
this out we're getting wicked fringing
now and it looks like it's actually
related to HDR so even though I'm
running for two - here we go 12 bit 144
Hertz even I bet if I even crank it to
200 Hertz we get no fringing without HDR
unless we move it around see there you
go you got to move it around to have any
effect whatsoever so this is it first
time gaming an HDR at homeland 200 Hertz
the sunlight looks really really natural
compared to what you'd be accustomed to
seeing in games and even in the spots
where we've got like a pretty
significant contrast between sunlight
reflection and then something dark
underneath it I'm not really getting a
noticeable halo or fringe around it that
looks really sharp doesn't it one thing
I'd like to try though is dialing it
back to 144 Hertz
no chroma subsampling so back at 444
10-bit color honestly I wouldn't say
there's anything immediately noticeable
this game does look really really good
an HDR though so I could actually see
myself dialing back the maximum refresh
rate for games that are all about the
visuals but
there are also situations where I
wouldn't want to compromise on that at
all and I'd be willing to go to you know
eight bid or four to two subsampling or
whatever the case may be and that's
something like like a pixel precision
you know platform or like Super Meat Boy
okay yeah he's a boy no question I kind
of said I could get used to playing my
game like this at 200 Hertz gravy
branded but as for my last game test
actually the game that I started this
entire personal rig update over over
land I don't have an issue but this is
the first game that we've tried today
where the full array local dimming is
noticeable when I'm messing over the
water and I would find that distracting
so yeah this is the first situation
where I would probably find myself
wanting to go in and turn that off and I
guess that's actually a perfect place to
summarize my thoughts on this display
it's an incredible piece of technology I
haven't even mentioned this yet but we
validated a Seuss's included color
calibration report with Delta ease of
two or less making it not just great for
gaming but also content consumption and
even content creation but both its
greatest strengths and its greatest
weakness is the incredible degree of
customization that it allows so you can
decide what color depth you want or
whether you want chroma subsampling or
whether you want to trade off more
refresh rate or less refresh rate or you
want to run HDR no HDR do you want to
have full array local dimming on or off
if you're not using HDR and you can dial
in exactly the experience you want on a
per game basis but it also means that
you have to have a pretty decent level
of understanding of all the dials and
knobs that are at your fingertips now
for me personally there's no going back
at this point it's just that if you're
in the market for one of these make sure
you set aside maybe a couple hours to do
