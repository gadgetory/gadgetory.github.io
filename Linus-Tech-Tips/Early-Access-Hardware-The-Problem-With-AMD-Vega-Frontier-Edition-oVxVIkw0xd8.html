late June of this year we asked Vandy
for a sample of the vega frontier
edition we were hoping that we could
compare it against the titan XP and GT x
1080 TI that back then cost a bit more
and a bit less respectively and also use
it to guesstimate the performance of the
then upcoming RX Vega so why are we
finally publishing this video today well
buckle up my friends because it's kind
of a long story and that story is
brought to you by Tuttle Bayer Tritonal
bear for free with no credit card
required at tunnel bear comm /l tt it's
the easy to use VPN
so AMD declined our sample request for
frontier Edition that happens sometimes
and it's fine now sometimes companies do
this because they don't want press
looking too closely at a product but
other times it's for perfectly
legitimate reasons either way it piqued
our curiosity so we put on our big-boy
pants ordered one for ourselves and a
week later tore it out of its box to
bask in its blue brushed aluminum and
khaki yellow glowing glory but what else
is there in the box well there's some
foam and this weird booklet of like
Kickstarter II promotional material
that's strangely for the product that we
just already bought I mean look at this
stuff oh and they are people who
boundaries as starting lines did anyone
even proofread this the box might not
seem important but this was actually a
pretty pivotal point in our experience
with the frontier Edition because this
was when we realized just how rushed and
poorly thought-out this product was and
it actually went downhill from there we
set up our closed GPU test bench
downloaded the only available driver
that was on AMD site up until it finally
got an update over three months later in
October and fired up our blender test
suite where Vega ended up on the bottom
in the BMW and classroom tests then all
the way on top in the fishy cat test
making it at best inconsistent and at
worst Oh
so at this point we DD you´d and
reinstalled the driver but no joy there
and even tried switching to gaming mode
in the dual mode driver which also
didn't help okay then so since we're in
gaming mode what about gaming unit in
super position and 3d mark score saw it
get absolutely spanked by the $700 1080
Ti and then the but paddling continued
in both Deus Ex mankind divided and rise
of the Tomb Raider at 4k in both DirectX
11 and DirectX 12 modes so between the
performance
the stability the thermal throttling and
the power consumption the whole
experience up to that point had frankly
been super balls at this point we were
certain of just two things one was that
Vega frontier addition existed only to
cater to hard core AMD fans with what
felt like it was an overpriced slap in
the face and to that our ex Vega was
going to be a power-hungry dog at the
rumored pricing now throughout this we
hadn't heard back from AMD about our
problems
so we forged ahead and then just as our
video was getting ready to be published
actually while I was down at AMD
checking out their Vegas supercomputer
demo they told us well hey guys we think
it's unfair of you to judge Vegas gaming
performance on frontier because Raja
Kaduri posted in a reddit thread
somewhere that it wasn't for gaming and
that our benchmark suite wasn't showing
frontier strength because workloads like
blender didn't benefit from its
workstation DNA and we didn't include
enough scientific performance analysis
so what they offered was to give us some
help with the second part of it if we
held off publishing the video to ensure
we were doing it properly ok fair enough
then I guess but weeks and then months
passed and that help didn't materialize
then while we sat there waiting our ex
Vega launched with performance that put
frontier neck-and-neck with Vega 64
exactly as we'd expected and laid out in
our original script for this video and
it makes perfect sense other than
coloured the only differences between
them are the driver the frame buffer
size frontier editions higher base and
boost clocks and a locked maximum fan
speed of 40% so I'm not gonna mince
words we felt cheated as a customer
remember we bought this stupid thing for
$1000 and manipulated as press because
it's
as though our video got buried to
prevent the negative PR from raining on
our ex Vegas parade and we made these
feelings clear to AMD who renewed their
commitment to helping us benchmark
frontier Edition properly but in the
back of our minds what we wondered was
if they were just hoping that we would
just forget about publishing a video
about a months old and now very
irrelevant product and focus on their
shiny new WX 9100 workstation card no
such luck so then for the first of two
AMD recommended benchmarks we'll be
looking at spec you perf 12.1 a
collection of 3ds max Maya SolidWorks
and other workloads for which AMD says
frontier Edition is optimized and
actually ok frontier Edition does pull
out a head of Vega 64 and even GT X 1080
Ti in particular wherever edges are used
in the rendering pipeline and in the
memory shredding scientific energy and
medical tests the Titan XP though blows
them all the way to see how much of this
performance comes from the workstation
driver path we switched the driver mode
to gaming where interestingly frontier
ends up well below Vega 64 level
performance so it's clear that unless
your loads specifically benefit from 16
gigs of VRAM any advantage to frontier
is purely a software switch though to be
clear we aren't singling out AMD for
this behavior team Green's tighten and
quadrille lineups are differentiated
from g-force
in a very similar manner and to AMD's
credit frontiers positioning as a sort
of workstation card like the original
Titan sparked a response from Nvidia to
give Titan XP back some of the
professional features that they had
removed over the years so kudos for that
the second of our two AMD recommended
benchmarks Manero mining uses the Vega
optimized cast XMR miner
AMD's beta blockchain optimized driver
and here we are actually greeted with
excellent results of up to one point
eight five kilo hashes per second though
that quickly drops to one point five
once thermal throttling kicks in
I do believe a driver fix unlocking fan
speed is coming
but until then even a Vega 56
outperforms frontier Edition
significantly so then is Vega frontier
Edition a legitimate product or was it
like an early access game with day one
dlc a beta where you pay AMD for the
privilege of reporting bugs and
third-party software incompatibilities
like those blender crashes while they
polish the real product WX 9100 on paper
frontier kind of makes sense
it gets more RAM and some workstation
features compared to a consumer card and
that's for half of the price of the
higher-end workstation card that gives
you ACC memory support frame lock
genlock stereo 3d and far more
professional application certifications
but in the real world
WX ninety one hundred Street pricing has
fallen to just fifteen hundred dollars
already for the full-fledged Megan
experience and frontiers actual value
add over a regular gaming card is pretty
limited leaving us in no-man's land
unless we're concerned with and only
with some pretty specific use cases I
mean even AMD only managed to come up
with one
benchmark that actually demonstrated its
value for us so then if AMD had
positioned frontier as a developer kit
like the oculus dk1 or dk2
and even if it was paid and expensive
but available to developers like through
their website we wouldn't be having this
conversation but as it is whatever they
posted on reddit months ago their
actions were to put this product on sale
to consumers in the consumer channel
even going as far as to bundle quake
champions crap with the water-cooled
version
get upset when we wanted to talk about
why it was a stupid product for
consumers then come up with only a
couple of pretty flimsy reasons why we
shouldn't be pissed about the
performance of our castrated WX that we
bought instead of a Titan XP which
incidentally would game better in our
spare time and consume less power
smells like early access to me I think
the right way to fix this is for AMD to
just discontinue this thing and even if
it doesn't help the AMD enthusiast
gamers out there who got sucked into it
turn around and unlock as many of the WX
9100 features as they can for the people
out there who have them what do you guys
think we really do want to hear from you
