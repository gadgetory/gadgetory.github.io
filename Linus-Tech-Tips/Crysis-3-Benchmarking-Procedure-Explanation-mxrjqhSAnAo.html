benchmarking guide is brought to you by
our trusted graphics partner EVGA
welcome to the jungle indeed our level
of choice for Crysis 3 benchmarking and
our platform is powered by an EVGA
GeForce GTX Titan graphics card although
we're not giving any performance numbers
in this particular video we have a
separate video with benchmarks for the
GTX Titan itself this is mostly focused
on the all-new Crysis 3 how to benchmark
this game for yourself so you'll have
results that you can easily compare to
the ones that slick and I are publishing
in all of our video card and CPU reviews
so this is the run that we use from the
welcome to the jungle level it's one of
the autosave so you'll just have to sort
of trial and error it until you find the
right one I'm going to have slick do a
little walkthrough so you can it's a
two-minute run we use fraps to record
the minimum maximum and average fps and
slip will show you exactly how to do the
run the same way that we do we start off
just by jumping down here I activate
armor but you don't actually need it
because by the time we get into a
firefight you'll regionally HP anyways
the beginning of this benchmark is
pretty passive it doesn't actually start
until he gets up to top of the ramp by
the way I'll show you exactly where we
start the benchmark starts right here
right when you see is back
like I was saying the beginning of the
benchmark is pretty passive there's kind
of two parts to this benchmark the first
part we're just showing off like water
effects collision as psycho and myself
run through grass and coming up here in
a little bit collision has cycled myself
run through some cloth it's hanging from
the ceiling so it's just more showing
off different parts of the crisis engine
and letting it do its thing and then the
second part of the benchmark is a lot
more action there's explosions fire
killing etc so some more grass collision
here then there's the cloth collision so
we do appears just we look at our bow
and then he's going to climb up that
ladder on the left and something falls
off it makes a big noise and then when
he looks down at us and when he motions
downward with his hand it's right there
we're gonna go through the door then
this part needs to be done very quickly
so you don't get rekt get to the top of
the stairs scope in and take out this
turret real quick with this Kosovo's and
then kill this guy you don't want to
deep right away because not this time
but sometimes they throw grenades at you
so you don't want that to affect your
benchmark at all
well that barrel and then take out this
guy on the left if he's not here
that can be one to two guys here if he's
not there he's just to the right here
they're usually only one guy but there
may be two want the stairs right here
and then again there's usually about one
to two people at the top of these stairs
let's see how many guys in oh yes time
upset there's only one so I'm going to
take em out and then go to the left here
and jump in the last section of this
broken-down train and then you want to
fight here you want to keep pushing so
don't worry too much about taking damage
because you will very likely not die but
just keep moving forward and just keep
shooting and then you just do the jump
here at the end of the bridge and the
benchmark should end right there
if not it'll end right there for you and
you may want to run it again but it
should be okay well I hope you guys
enjoyed our Crysis 3 benchmarking guide
happy benchmarking and this is
interesting but an uncomfortable way to
die don't forget to subscribe to Linus
