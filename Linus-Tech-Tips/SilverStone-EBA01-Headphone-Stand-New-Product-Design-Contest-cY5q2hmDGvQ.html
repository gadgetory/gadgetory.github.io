there ones that clip to your desk ones
that sit on top of your desk ones with
unusual aesthetics and ones that mount
to the back of your monitor the problem
with most of these solutions however is
that my teleprompter isn't working so
you'll have to just give me a minute
sorry but the problem with most of these
solutions is that they're either very
expensive poorly constructed or some
combination of the two so today's video
is a bit of a two-parter no no just one
video two segments of one video it's all
good
where we'll be taking a look at an
underappreciated gem from Silverstone
the EBA zero one headphone stand and
giving our audience the opportunity to
design the next addition to
Silverstone's headphone holder line up a
wall mounted aluminum headphone stand
of course our HX 1200 eye power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power and coarser link
digital for advanced monitoring and
control click this spot right here to
learn more so here's my problem and it's
a first world problem to be sure but one
that I know at least some of you can
relate to even if not to quite the same
degree I have a lot of headphones I do
reviews of them and any headphone
comparison without side by side back to
back listening is completely worthless
because it takes a matter of seconds for
our brains to adjust to a new sound
signature and forget what the last thing
we were listening to sounded like so
having some kind of organizational
system for my headphones other than
throw them in the pile is a bit of a
must for me and that's where headphone
stands come in this one I have that
clips to your desk is pretty cool but
well it does a great job of avoiding the
pitfalls of most other headphone stands
and most DIY solutions it's stable and
doesn't damage the foam padding of the
headband it was IMO overpriced for its
plastic construction and yes I said was
from what I know it's discontinued now
anyway if you're looking for something
freestanding there's actually a ton of
options out there though but most of
them kind of suck for some reason or
another so when I first saw the EBA zero
one in the Silverstone suite at sea yes
this year I was like floored that I
hadn't seen anyone talking about this
product I mean sure it doesn't do
anything particularly groundbreaking in
terms of functionality it's got a base
an arm and then like a wide contoured
hanger that is long enough to hold one
or two large pairs of headphones but it
was the quality of the construction and
the price that blew me away because I
wish I could still find the archive to
drop for it but people bought a metric
but ton of these where is that thing
yeah this thing people bought a ton of
these on mass drop for not that cheap
and frankly it's not that nice I only
bought one of them actually over a year
ago because there just aren't that many
great options and I needed something to
put headphones on while we take b-roll
of them and on top of that people are
crapping themselves over this thing at a
hundred and forty dollars I mean sure
it's nice but a hundred and forty
dollars when the eva-01 with its solid
anodized aluminum construction I mean
you could kill a man with this thing is
on the market for less than half of that
price anyway
as excited as I was about this puppy I
knew it wasn't gonna solve my problem
anyway because instead of an ocean of
headphones all over my desk I'd have a
sea of free-standing eva-01 holders all
over my desk so I'm not really getting
any space back so I asked Silverstone
moments the wall-mounted version coming
right all right I mean there is a
wall-mounted headphone holder available
from a company called K an M but it's
another plastic one and I frankly didn't
think it was that nice and by the time I
spent twenty dollars us and ship it
across the border from B&amp;amp;H is the only
place I found it I'd feel better just
buying something a little bit nicer in
the first place and so they went oh well
we don't have plans to expand the
product line this isn't selling very
well so I was like what and I decided to
take matters into my own hands and over
the last four months I've been poking
and prodding and getting silverstone to
agree to expand the lineup if I can
prove that there's a demand for a really
nice and not horrific ly overpriced
aluminum this time wall-mounted
headphone stand but there's a catch I
meant not that well-suited for modeling
work if you catch my drift so I won't be
designing the wall-mounted headphone
stand nope that's where you the Linus
tech tips and 3d printing communities
come in we've partnered with me factory
dot-com to do something really cool here
so navigate to the page linked in the
video description to submit your 3d
model for the wall-mounted headphone
stand that you want silverstone to make
out of anodized aluminum
don't worry if you're not a 3d design
expert you can go to the link anyway and
vote on your favorite designs that were
submitted by other users my mini factory
and this is kind of their thing so that
you know that every design you download
from their site is actually possible to
print will print every single submitted
design then the top ten entries will be
determined by a combination of votes and
Linus Media Group staff judgment and
will be shipped to our headquarters at
that time I will make another video to
show off the finalists with a bunch of
different headphones on them so the 3d
printing enthusiasts out there can
decide which one they like and want to
print off knowing that it'll actually
work awesome but then it gets better a
single design one of them will be chosen
from the finalists by my team and
Silverstone's folks to go into
production as a real product every
finalist will receive the aluminum
version of the winning design in silver
or black according to their choice with
the designer of the actual winning
product receiving both silver and black
ones and a 100 X % exclusive gold
colored anodized headphone stand of
their own design so get to it folks you
can find the full details of the contest
including the link in the video
description and submissions will be
accepted until Monday June the 8th if
you want you guys to have a little bit
of time to spend on these to come up
with something like that'll really be
awesome cuz it's gonna be like a real
product so I think that's pretty much it
other than that the timelines up in the
air so stay tuned on social media for
more updates guys thanks for watching
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it also leave a
comment if you have a comment about it
all of this do you think this is kind of
a cool idea it was sort of me pushing
Silverstone really hard to do this so I
hope you think it's a good idea also
linked in the video description we have
a link to our forum we have one where
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
one where you can give us a monthly
contribution if you think the work we're
doing is awesome and you want to see
more of it and finally one where you can
