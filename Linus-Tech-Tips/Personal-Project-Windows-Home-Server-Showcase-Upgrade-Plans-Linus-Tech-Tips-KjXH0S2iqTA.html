an awful lot but I don't think I've ever
actually shown it to you guys so here it
is in its current configuration it's
running Windows Home Server v1 and I
actually just recently made some changes
to it so I went from a LGA 775
configuration to a Z on board and a
low-power xeon 1155 processor i've got
some old-school a neon memory in there
remember c'mon des yeah they're on a
business so I've got two gigs of RAM I
actually recently changed the power
supply as well I used to have an 850
watt power supply and here I've gone to
a 1050 watt power supply but that's not
actually because I needed the extra
wattage but rather because I needed a
power supply that had the ability or the
before site to separate and put the
peripheral connectors on two separate
rails so that way I'm able to plug in my
up to 24 drives in the front to two
separate rails on the power supply the
other one had all of the peripheral
connectors running off of a single rail
which overloaded it as soon as the drive
started to spin up even when I turned on
staggered spin up which means that the
drives some of them spin and then the
other ones spin and the other one spin
so they don't all hit your power supply
at the same time so that was why I went
with a different power supply I'm using
a Norco case that has a SFF 80-82 or
whatever whatever this connector is
called I can't remember so up to four
SATA or SAS channels per connector
although I'm only running SATA drives
because I am running Windows Home Server
right I also recently changed my SSD so
I had my Corsair what was it I can't
even remember I posted this on there
because I thought it was pretty lulz but
my Corsair S series so this was back
with day out when they were using the
Samsung controllers I posted this on my
Twitter as like a tombstone outside so
this is the first SSD that actually had
legitimately died on me when I had it
deployed and I think the reason for that
is just Windows Home Server really
trashes your boot drive Windows Home
Server v1 is what I'm running because it
uses it not only as the LS
but also as a storage drive as part of
the drive pool which balances itself
around all the time so it just really
gets hit pretty hard so I went with an
Intel drive just because you know
legendary reliability and all of that
510 series just because it's a little
bit older so I got a good deal in terms
of the raid card I'm running again this
is a bit of an older made card it's not
SATA 3 or anything like that but it's an
arica 1680 IX this is a 24 portrayed
card I think it's got like 256 Meg's of
memory on it I haven't really upgraded
it it's not 512 512 Meg's I haven't
really upgraded it because it hasn't
been necessary because I'm not actually
running in raid yet but I will in the
future when I upgrade to Windows Home
Server v2 or 2011 or whatever it's
called I'm going to put a proper raid
array because right now I have well I
have what Windows Home Server v1 was
basically designed for and that is the
most ghetto possible arrangement of
drives ever because v1 is all about
taking random assortments of drives and
configuring them in the drive drive pool
so what the drive pool does is it
redundant Lee stores all of your data on
at least two drives at any given time
and it rebalances it constantly to make
sure that it stays on at least two
drives at any given time so the
performance isn't great however I can
usually get 70 to 100 megabytes per
second reading right from the whole
server at a given time but it's really
not good enough anymore because I'm
editing video directly off the server
these days and so that is what's
prompted on my next upgrade so here
check this out guys so I've got any sort
of random variety of drive so there's a
Seagate 7200 point 10 320 gig drive here
let's go through and look at the mall
there's another one of those so let's
slide that back in here's a 250 gig 7200
point 10 here is an empty one here's an
empty one so we got three drives so far
this whole sort of space should be empty
here three drives three guys for drive
so there's a WD one time fighting black
5 drives another WD one terabyte black
empty 6 drives a WD one terabyte black 7
drives or WD one terabyte black 8 drives
a Seagate 7200 point 11 500 gig nine
drives a 7200 point 10 500 kick 10
drives a WD one terabyte black 11 drives
a WD one terabyte green twelve drives
the WD one terabyte black 13 drives a
Hitachi one terabyte 14 drives a hit at
two one terabyte 15 drives a WD 2
terabyte black 16 drives the WD 6 40 gig
black and 17 drives a Hitachi one
terabyte so what I want to do is I want
to build
Windows Home Server to doesn't include
the drive extender so I can no longer
use my random mishmash of drives here in
order to get my you know eight or nine
terabytes or whatever works up to a
storage over a span of like 16 drives I
have to build a proper raid array so
what I'm going to do is I am going to
get a new boot drive so you have to have
at least I think it's a 160 gig new
driver Windows Home Server 2 so I can't
even use my 120 gig intel SSD you'll
have to get something bigger I still
want to go with an SSD for the V Drive I
still had more hard drives fail over the
last few years than SSDs and at one SSD
fail and I've had anywhere from about 8
to 10 hard drives fail in that given
time and it's not that I don't deploy
enough SSDs I mean my personal rig has 8
SSDs in it for the boot drive so it's
not really that I don't think so I'm
still going to go with an SSD for the
boot drive and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to build myself a raid 6
array with some new Seagate 3 terabytes
the consumer-level WD drives aren't that
great for raid these days so I'll find
enough empty ones build a raid array on
the card and then in the Windows Home
Server view 1 operating system I will
then transfer all the data off the drive
pool drives to the raid array and a raid
array has a few advantages the
performance will be dramatically better
and I'll tell you how I'm going to
leverage that because a single gigabit
per second connection isn't going to do
it performance will be better also it
will be more real time in terms of the
data reliability so the drive pool takes
in the data then it kind of waits for
you to be idle and then it shuffle
it around where as raid will actually
dynamically in real time be shuffling it
to all the right places and raid six can
lose up to two drives before you lose
any data as long as you you know throw a
new one in there and rebuild the raid
before you know an additional two drives
fail I grade five I don't think is
reliable enough because if one drive
fails and then another one fails while
you're rebuilding it then you've lost
your data but breed six you can lose up
to two so that's why I want to go with
raid six other advantages I mean
disadvantages are that you can't just
dynamically throw drives in it and just
kind of increase your storage you have
to actually plan it and build it
properly but I don't need that much
storage space anyway so it's not really
the end of the world okay that's just
what you're going crazy um yeah you have
to have like all matching drives and
stuff like that is kind of a pain you
have to just generally manage it better
however the raid card should help me
because at least with a high end raid
card you can you can change the raid
level on-the-fly if you want you can add
drives to the raid on the fly if you
want you can remove drives from the raid
on the fly if you want so that that will
help a lot so that's the migration plan
here and then I'm also going to be
changing my motherboard because I need
more than one PCIe slot see there's a
single PCIe 16x slot on this board right
now that's where I've got the raid card
plugged into but I'm going to be adding
a quad port Ethernet card next so I've
already added one to my personal desktop
you can see right here I've got an Intel
server Nick it's got four ports on it
there that plus the Intel Nick built
into my motherboard is going to give me
up to assuming I'm using cat 6 cables
and assuming I have a compatible switch
which is why this is sitting here it's
going to give me up to five gigabit per
second to anything else that is
similarly connected using a teaming or
whatever that's called whatever so they
all work together and you basically
combine the theoretical maximum
throughput of all the ports are using
together so I'm going to take a new z77
board that just has sort of all of the
all the PCIe slots that I need and then
I'm going to still use the low voltage
be honest with me it'll run in it I
think it should be fine so I'm going to
put this in there use the Intel Ethernet
here throw another one of those that
will probably put it in this one so it
runs directly off the PCIe controller on
the CPU rather than down through the
self bridge and then I'll run the raid
card off this one and that will give me
the expansion that I need to do my five
gigabit per second connection now the
requirement for that though is you have
to have a switch that's ready you have
to have a manageable switch so I'm going
to be using this guy is like a couple
hundred bucks and then there's even like
a twenty five dollar mir so this is a
twenty four port gigabit smart switch
and so what is it what is it called it's
the pro safe GS seven to forty three
hundred NES so I'm really excited to try
this out so that means between my
computer here and the Windows Home
Server which is on the other side of
that wall I will have a five gigabit per
second connection and then the rest of
the house will just be gigabit and that
will give me plus the raid six so the
additional performance I'm going to get
from not using the ghetto drive pool
should give me just screaming
performance between those two PC's and
then gigabit to everywhere else so I'm
very excited so basically I'm going to
try and find a cheaper power supply that
I can put in here because it's a total
waste of this thousand watt I need a new
boot drive I need to get Windows Home
Server v2 going I need to upgrade the
motherboard I need to add the four port
NIC and then I need to get some hard
drives so that is my project over the
next little while is a bit more of them
sort of it's a less sexy project than
upgrading my personal PC but I just
haven't at the time for a variety of
reasons lately and this seems like more
of a priority in terms of increasing my
productivity so that's what I'm working
on
