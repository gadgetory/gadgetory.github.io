unboxing of a new product from ATI this
is the DirectX 11 Radeon 54 50 so the 54
50 is pretty much a step down from the
5600 series now ATI has been doing
everything they possibly can it seems to
release as many DirectX 11 cards as
possible they are getting their whole
lineup launched top to bottom and so
this represents what is currently the
bottom for their DirectX 11 cards so
this is a 512 Meg card you can see that
here it has DVI VGA and HDMI output so
it would be suitable as a media card if
you wanted to output to your TV and it
has one gig of hyper memory now hyper
memory isn't something that we've seen
for a little while but I mean ATI also
hasn't released a new low-end card for a
little while so hyper memory basically
allows it to take use of your to make
use of your system memory as well as the
memory that's actually built onto the
card so here's a quick rundown of the
basic specs I'm not sure if you can read
that too I'll help you it's a 54 50 it's
PCI Express 2.0 140 nanometer process
technology DirectX 11 shader model 5 etc
etc I mean even with the gaming features
that this card does have I wouldn't
expect to be doing a whole lot of
hardcore gaming on it it is meant more
as you know what I've totally missed
this it has meant more as a power seat
saving green sort of initiative so one
thing that 80 is new 40 nanometer drive
Radeon 5000 series cards have done very
well is they have made they have really
cut down on the amount of power that
they use when they're idling or when
they're not actually processing 3d
images so let's just see what we have
for accessories here first of all we
have a quick installation guide ok so
they show you how to install the
graphics card into the slot plug in plug
in a power at the back I can't imagine
this having 6 pin PCI Express plug on it
but I guess we'll find out in a moment
and then inside the quick installation
guide you will find a driver DVD don't
use that just download the latest forms
off ATI com all right so let's get this
open here here is the
5450 itself that is everything that's in
the box so there's not a whole lot
included in terms of accessories which
in theory I guess you won't really need
because you can see that the card
includes pretty much all of the outputs
that you'd want DisplayPort hasn't
really caught on yet so whether you're
running a digital monitor 4d booth DVI
your TV HDMI or an old CRT monitor vga
or really old LCD i suppose would also
need vga you should be pretty much
covered now this card is passively
cooled which is great for a low-power
card because that means a okay you're
not getting a whole lot of heat p-put
out of it so that means that he put heat
output from this card so it means it can
be passively cooled and it also means
that it's great for media applications
because you're not going to have
additional little noisy fans going in
your pc it's also one fewer point of
failure I've seen so many low end
graphics cards fail over the years and
the only thing that died was the little
whiny fan on it so that's the only thing
that's wrong with it but they're so hard
to find a replacement for so it's kind
of long-winded but yeah I love passive
cards for that very reason this uses PCI
Express 2.0 as they mentioned on the box
so that's a standard PCI Express 16x
connector you can see a couple of RAM
chips at the back and I believe yep
there are a couple RAM chips not sure if
you can see through there if I Inglot
just right there are a couple of RAM
chips in there as well as the GPU itself
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the power color radeon 3450</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
