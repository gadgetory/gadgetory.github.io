series I'm going to be unboxing the
intel desktop board d 850 MD this is for
the Intel Pentium 4 processor technology
for the cutting edge of the Internet
so this product is uh definitely
engineered to make the best use of the
cutting edge of the Internet
okay so that means that it includes da
da LAN Intel Pro 100 LAN connection
norton internet security sound Knox with
SPX audio and for back panel USB 1.1
ports check that out it also has nti CD
maker 2000 this product is intended to
be professionally installed so unless
you're a professional don't install it I
guess is what they're trying to say okay
so it'd be D 850 MD combines solid
performance with support for Intel
Pentium 4 processors in the 478 pin
socket designed with the Intel 850
chipset harness is the full bandwidth
and performance of rd ram memory into a
micro ATX form factor awesome so our
dims that means we've got support for
dual Rambis channels with four RDM
sockets for pc 800 and pc 600 are drm up
to two gigabytes ok we have a
communication and networking riser
support an AGP connector intel rapid
BIOS boot ultra-fast ATA 100 that's
pretty ultra fast and then we have three
PCI slots ok is there anything else on
here that could be relevant no I don't
think so why don't we go ahead and get
this baby open you can see it's got like
some some cool text on the front about
400 megahertz front side bus yeah the
front side buses is dead and gone ok so
inside we find an i/o shield which looks
very much like the style sheets that we
have today then we have an Intel desktop
board I'll say the usual thing even
though I don't know how applicable it is
you should download the latest drivers
off the Intel website
have drivers available for this board
you can see that the sticker is actually
a little bit yellowed like fur for
context there's something white next to
it so this gives us the general layout
of the motherboard I can't tell which
way is actually up maybe it's this way
yeah there we go so our rim connector
secondary IDE primary IDE AGP socket
okay that's pretty good
next we have the quick reference guide
mmm interesting installing the i/o
shield I don't know how much interesting
stuff is going to be in here maybe
something about the warranty so I can
talk about how the warranty is
definitely gone a few different
languages okay let's lose that we'll
have a look at the board itself shortly
okay we've got a couple of IDE cables
and one floppy cable
there's the floppy cable and LU great
cables how very 90s and we've got a
couple of IDE cables ah hi-tech okay so
you can see one of the IDE cables is an
eighty pin cable that means that one out
of every two of these cables are
actually just blanks they're ground
cables and those are intended to prevent
interference from one cable to the next
so that's for high-speed ata 100
connections whereas this for optical
drives is a 40 pin connector so even
though they have the same connection
they this one's not optimized for low
interference there there's your um oh I
don't know what this is I haven't seen
this before this is actually a little
bit before my day to be perfectly honest
with you so I'm not going to be able to
provide quite the amount of insight that
I would normally be able to with a retro
unboxing because this is too retro even
for me so okay oh okay this was
mentioned on the front of the box so
this is some kind of like fastener for
the AGP card see normally we have these
built in these days but this seems to be
like a like a not built in one so you
put it on to the onto the connector
something okay I'm not gonna force it
because even though it's a little bit on
really want to break it okay so let's
see what do we got we got a socket 478
supporting the cutting-edge Pentium 4
internet processor
we've got four um what is this for
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry
for Rd round slots supporting dual
channel 20 pin ATX connector there's
your floppy connector to IDE connectors
for up to four hard drives presumably
supporting raid but you know what aboard
this old no probably not probably no
rate support okay and then we've got an
internal USB header so you can hook up
cutting-edge front USB and then you've
got a fan header a motherboard battery
and then some jumpers probably clear
CMOS that says config maybe it's to
config the BIOS I don't know what this
is and I don't know what this is that's
okay then we have three PCI slots
because this is well before PCI Express
took off and an AGP slot so that means
that we can hook up our cutting-edge
DirectX 9 or seven or eight graphics
card then we have a north bridge chipset
cooler which seems to have like hold
down on it so that all that comes off so
you can actually let me see well I mean
you know it's not like anyone's gonna
care if I damage this time so just there
we go
okay so you can actually take off the
Northbridge heatsink that easily and
let's have a look at the date on this
chip here you can see that it is marked
Intel zero zero so this is from 2000
that's when that chip was manufactured
very cool very very internet cutting
edge okay so let's see what else we've
got on this motherboard here we've got
an Intel p4 connector that's a four pin
connector and then I think that pretty
much takes care of what we've got on the
top of the board now here's the i/o
panel we've got a ps2 keyboard and mouse
2 USB 1.1 port a couple serial ports a
printer port haven't seen one of those
in a while a couple more USB 1.1 ports
there that's your internet connection
very cool how high-tech and then we've
got support for I believe they're saying
5.1 audio no AC 97
I don't think that is even configurable
25.1 so there's mic and then line out
and then speakers excellent thank you
