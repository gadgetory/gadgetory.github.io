fresh books the number one cloud-based
accounting software for freelancers
check it out at the link in the video
description so we're here in the Corsair
suite where as a surprise to absolutely
nobody Corsair has added RGB lighting to
yet another thing quite frankly I'm
surprised it took them this long I think
it has something to do with the
complexity of designing RGB lighting and
all of the control circuitry that goes
along with them in something as
precision tuned as high-speed ddr4
memory with that said they seem to have
pulled it off pretty darn well here
because their Vengeance RGB memory
modules are already running at 40 to 66
megahertz on the latest z to 70 platform
from Intel now speaking of platforms
these aren't going to run RGB on just
anything
thanks to Corsairs link software they've
got it working so far on z170 z 270 and
x 99 a differentiating factor compared
to competitor RGB memory modules and
they're also working on support for AMD
Rison but what do you get for your money
well you get some memory and you get
this handy-dandy little piece of
software that is extremely beta right
now that allows you to set up a bunch of
different color cycling profiles or
individual colors you can link them
between modules you cannot add
necessarily synchronize the actual
effects between modules even if they are
running the same ones again it's very
very early but if you were looking for
the way to take your RGB doubt system to
the next RGB level then Corsair has got
you covered
they're not launching until sometime in
like q1 of this year but if you're me
and you can't wait that long you can
just turn off the demo system wait for
the fans to spin down make sure it's
actually off it's really hard to tell if
computers are off these days because
they're all covered in lights even when
they're sleeping and you can just walk
right out of the booth with them right
now so thanks for checking out this
video on the Corsair suite and bye
everybody
I'm just kidding I'm back I'm back to
give Corsairs memory back and to thank
