2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm so we're here in the ocz
booth at computex 2013 now they find
themselves in a bit of an interesting
position where the move to boards
enterprise solutions has been underway
for a very long time but that doesn't
mean you can necessarily abandon the
consumer either so while the vector
hasn't been updated this drives been on
the market for quite a while there are a
couple of new additions to the product
line so number one is the vertex 450
right here so this uses the same end
links barefoot 3 controller as the
vector but what it adds is the latest 20
nanometer NAND flash so basically that
gives you a cost savings now the problem
right now is that with the nand shortage
that has been going on and i know most
sort of general consumers don't concern
themselves with these things but they're
very very real and very very true
unfortunately the pricing you've seen on
vector over the last little while and
the pricing you're seeing on vertex 450
now in the middle of a shortage isn't
that different but in the future that
should be an advantage for the vertex
450 compared to the vector now this one
right here is definitely not about cost
savings this is the vector PCIe so if
you're familiar with those disease Revo
drive line of products from the past
basically it's a PCI Express device so
it's a pci e 4x interface you've got two
into links barefoot three controllers
each with a full SSD on them so this
eliminates the state of three bottleneck
allowing it to achieve up to one
gigabyte per second as well as a hundred
and forty thousand I ops per second
which is much more than you can possibly
push over a single se23 interface now
we're going to go around a corner which
is going to be very hazardous for the
entire team moving around here with all
these like wires going on so all this
stuff on the left you've seen before but
this guy right here is new now when we
were at CES we were showing off a
software solution that ocz was working
on that would allow their SSD products
to accelerate databases and accelerate
specific workloads in a very in a very
impactful way this guy right here is
pretty much where that product is headed
so it's a hardware
device this is the ZDX el SQL
accelerator and if you don't know what
it does then you just have to read the
title it implements some of the software
development that they've done and adds
it to what is a dedicated device that is
designed just for this so pretty much
I'm not an expert when it comes to SQL
databases so the cameras looking at it
right now read that if none of it means
anything to you then you're probably not
the target customer but if you do
understand all of that then it should be
pretty darn impressive don't miss any of
our computex 2013 coverage don't forget
we're powered here at the show by
Western Digital corsair vengeance gaming
peripherals and NCIX calm and as always
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips not quite sure what happened there
but here we are in the ocz booth where
we are actually going to be showing off
a couple of new products so the fatality
series of power supplies has been around
for a pretty long time at this point but
now we have been tada the new fatality
series so they're launching a couple of
different capacities the 750 watt as
well as their 550 watt these are both
fully modular power supplies so if you
come around the right side here you'll
be able to have a look at how there are
absolutely no cables attached to them
unfortunately unlike the fatality 1000
watt we don't get the individually
sleeved cables that made that particular
PSU very very impressive but what we do
get is an updated feature set so they're
80 plus bronze certified as well as
having full support for Intel's Haswell
fourth-generation core series processor
what that basically means is even at
extremely low loads they're able to
provide stable enough power that the
processor is able to go down into its c6
and c7 states giving you a very very low
idle power consumption they also come
with five year warranties and now I
think we're actually done without sort
of forgetting about anything now that's
not new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
