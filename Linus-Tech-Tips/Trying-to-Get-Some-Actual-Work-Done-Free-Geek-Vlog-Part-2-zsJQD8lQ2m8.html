for more vlogging so follow along with
the exploits of well probably Dennis and
Taryn are going to be pretty interesting
storylines here so obviously we're
filming this before we start but yeah
we're going to be reusing reducing
recycling reselling rebuilding and doing
all those readings with computers and
it's going to be freaking awesome
careful Dennis
a Pacers Knox ddr4 sodium laptop
memories designed for gamers and general
consumers alike check out the link in
the video description to learn more so
we are at the disassembly station gloves
are required where we take apart the
stuff that's too old or too broken to
really be of much use to anybody so the
point here is to pretty much find stuff
like these old Pentium Pro CPUs which
are chock full of valuable metals like
gold yarr given by gold tooth check this
out
this computer has one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen fourteen rear
accessible expansion slots that is a lot
of video cards I wish I had a board like
this for seven gamers one CPU I could do
fourteen gamers one CPU assuming I could
find a similar dual power supply set up
for that with like 120 millimeter
cooling fans on each power supply 420
Watts total yeah the power density is a
little higher I mean silverstone has a
650 watt that's like this big now sick
look at this Pentium Pro Pentium Pro my
friends that is really not what that
means I know
yeah I must pick a cab you know that's
not really okay push it in hey so we're
done we got one
 to me um what else can we do this
pile of stuff yeah I think this this
pile is all there's so much here okay
here I think good how do you take one of
these I'll take the other one we'll see
you does it quicker Taryn and I are
going to race to see who can disassemble
this quicker yeah I don't think that's
how that's supposed to work if you fake
wine what you're whining
okay just there's no screws wait so you
guys are racing and you're having Linus
elfia cousin Sommers my secret weapon is
to just apply us to it yeah I'm actually
not sure how the side panel comes out no
how am I supposed to know it's unlocked
up the front bezel Oh Oh interesting
wait the front comes off first I think
the whole thing comes off the front it
goes the other way see those that I used
to play a game called mother mixed up
mother Goose man me too yeah good for
you did you get Terran it's not about
beating mixed up mother Goose it's not
hard if you look in here you can see
this clip that's holding it for
everything okay yeah you think so you
got to give this back to me
okay I was I was looking in the kitchen
for muffins I couldn't find it
this is not hard just taking stuff it's
time to taking stuff apart
is actually not that you some stuff I'm
not sure it was just I have to use the
screwdriver or should I just like break
it actually yeah this is a lot harder
than I thought it would be yeah cuz
there's some tape under the thing it
would be easier if you were allowed to
break yeah so I've been taking apart a
tape drive we found it right here as a
SATA connection and an LSI controller as
you can see right there I'm assuming
this guy's dead or else I wouldn't be in
this file but if it wasn't this would be
worth a ton right a little hidden
treasures all over here in the store
which is behind us right now if we don't
worry about it there's a whole bunch of
little things I don't even know for sale
that I've never seen before
my entire life super old
this is kind of like the chill-out
station where you dig through all of the
cables and pieces of cables and you chop
the ends off of them and then you can
you can actually sell the copper of the
aluminum for a higher price than if they
were still sheep instead connectors on
them the issue that Luke and I found
with this station is that they have a
lot of really good stuff in here like
these yeah these are awesome so these
are actually for jumping to power
supply's off of the same motherboard so
that you can have a dual power supply
system like what austin was trying to do
in the last scrapyard wars they've got
about a bazillion of these riser cards
one to sixteen for running like Bitcoin
machines basically so probably someone
who had an entire farm of Bitcoin
machines or a whole bunch of people who
had entire farms of Bitcoin machines
because there's actually like an obscene
amount of these cables like we can
probably pick out as many as we wanted
to I think the video card Bitcoin mining
trend is done I think it's dead there's
there's a lot there's other cables in
here that are crazy as well I don't know
this why is there then basically all the
end pieces go in here because these are
the actually like non valuable parts
because they're gonna be mostly plastic
and whatnot so they use these like giant
cutters just Kong we all knew we all
knew where this mouse was gonna end up
hey whoa whoa whoa are you throwing
these away - you know what these are no
these are for running dual power
supplies so this jumps the green and the
black pin so you can run two power
supplies at the same time when you when
you power on the system show me off
could use this instead burglars I am
Telling You Austin it should have used
this in scrap yard Boris yeah I mean I
know you guys can't keep it everything
but like these these are actually like
these again are probably about five ten
bucks a pop yeah I mean I don't know who
you would sell them to that's the issue
the buyers yeah finding the buyer is the
hard part but uh cheese I feel like I
could spend all day digging through this
tape in now so I'm down to 2.5 inch
drives I'm going to try to go through
all of them all at once just see that
taking stuff apart oh that's so hard and
I have to go child art so it's not
really broken but it's kind of look what
is he broken now your life was flat head
heads all my computer's not working what
should I do
you blow on the cartridge and put the
CPU back in yeah okay
why is high weight cuz you're slow here
stop go up we're good there you go
I like that Oh fish eye does he worry no
that's really fun yeah whoa sorry about
that stopped at the top whoa so it's
like an elevating optical drive so we
can move out of the way if you need to
work on it
that's actually pretty sick
hey sometimes you operate a camera cool
multi-talented wait I thought you did
operate a camera for a lot of minuses
video yeah actually
but not that one of that sensor yeah
much simpler camera the same bug engine
zoom and zoom apps well if it's an
articulating button okay technically yes
it's one button with two so if you were
watching this video and thinking
yourself gee what a handsome and
well-groomed gentleman that line of
Sebastian is I appreciate your honesty
but I cannot take all the credit it is
thanks to Dollar Shave Club that I can
have my face all smooth and clean
looking without spending too much
because when you go to the store and you
buy the refill cartridges for your
razors it is costing so much money I
can't figure out why when Dollar Shave
Club for just a couple dollars a month
can ship you your razor handles and then
new blades once a month so affordably
like right to your door you don't even
have to go out and buy it and they've
got other great bathroom supplies too
including their aftershave their shave
butter that goes on clear so you can see
what you're doing and their one wipe
Charlies peppermint scented butt wipes
for men the mirror is not included so
you can see what you're doing with those
so all you got to do to join is head
over to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus
linked in the video description and join
the club like so many hundreds upon
hundreds of our Linus tech tip
