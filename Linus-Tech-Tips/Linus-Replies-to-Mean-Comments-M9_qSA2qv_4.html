comments that's all I get
I need chapstick oh you're not gonna
read them to me I have to read them
hey we were out of ideas this week and
James had some time so he compiled a
list of mean comments from you guys to
me for me to read to you
you know I should really be sitting on
the can because that's usually where I
read comments the Corsair one I 160
gaming PC is tiny but don't let it fool
you it packs high-end components like an
RT X 20 80 TI graphics card check it out
at the link below if they were a couple
Linus would be the power bottom and
James would be the top maybe you can
explain what a power bottom is to me
Riley do you want to explain what a
power bottom is bottomless top energy
small pick energy this dude looks like a
used toilet brush that's it that's all
there's no context whatsoever Linus in
2009 looks like a virgin - in 2019 looks
like a virgin in HD shut up Riley you
still look like a cute lesbian sandals
with socks pure vagina repellent you
know what I'm doing it you spelled
sandals wrong I feel a little better
right now
Linus looks like he just got out of his
Subaru after ripping a phat vape what
video is this on the hot tub one I
always Lal hard at the group part of
Linus media group its Napoleon syndrome
little Citroen or whatever else you wish
to call yourselves what you like but we
talk the truth a tiny little building
with a boss who wears leather sandals
and drives a spray painted pink car
there's a no three Civic by the way holy
Wow production-wise you've done an
amazing job other than doing half of
your videos like fuck football the
content has been perfect
I really wish YouTube would stop trying
to shove this retard down our throats
bigger question is can you stay the fuck
my home feed I can't believe he's
gaining subscribers with this content
please stop making videos please this
shows you how fucking rich Linus is he
blows tons of cash for his pointless
studio and his bedroom looks like Airbnb
SHhhh
I swear this motherfucker is mentally
handicapped Wow - you're still a low
testosterone and a massive fucking thing
I always thought Linus was gay back in
the NCIX days now I know he's just
Canadian is there any way you could turn
your voice
testosterone plus one it sounds like a
dying yak Bruce Jenner's gay cat has
more testosterone than these whiny twats
connecting ethernet cables Tech came
here straight from a woman youtuber and
instantly noticed lionesses voices
higher I can't wait for the day when
Linus's balls drop to release his man
voice oh me neither
this is James's favorite one your
clickbait red thumbnail face you low
testosterone little bit close your mouth
never had my testosterone levels
measured but they could be well I enjoy
your videos but I find something
annoying about you but can't figure it
out you know what I find annoying about
you the fact that you put a period
before your space at the end of the
sentence the fact that you put up your
space before your periods at the end of
the sentence yeah I'm feeling big now
also you didn't capitalize I okay why is
this coming apart Oh
oh my god it's hot I've seen porn with
better acting than this it's fair have
you ever seen a real vagina and not on
your $100,000 computer Oh porn I get it
I thought they meant literally on the
computer Linus is Loki racist is this
the part where I point out I have an
Asian wife is that a defense - has a
small dick what I will say is I have
very small hands and you know what they
say about people with small hands that
it's not always proportional which you
sub to her
this is painfully ridiculous and
absolutely indoctrinated stupidity
beyond anything I'd like to be part of I
do not feel the need to be bombarded
with writted tech propaganda every two
seconds I certainly would not
be taking advice from a 40 year old
virgin socially awkward asexual rooted
beta male CP worshipping nerd like this
condescending Apple fuck your own
assuming YouTube algorithm asses with
this pathetic geeky losers can wrath
dick Ulis wow you mad you real bad I
can't keep watching your Canadian fat
ass because you keep reaching in your
right pocket I don't know or care what
you're doing it's way too distracting to
watch the fuck video I'm advancing my
teleprompter also it's why oh you are
what's with your fuck big sheets your
lawnmower across that for you what does
quaff mean dudes I don't know I'm just
reading off the page the 90s called they
want this a gel hairstyle pack I don't
know what else to do with it
I feel like this dude's an apple IRL and
feel safe because he's surrounded by a
bunch of nerds this is beautiful the two
worst most annoying people on YouTube
collaborating to make the most pieces
that anyone has ever used their eyeballs
to watch as opposed to watching it with
Braille like a lioness rhymes with sinus
which rhymes with China's China's is
close enough to Chinese that we can say
without any doubt that Linus is a
corporate shill paid by the Chinese to
promote Chinese crap
I'm sure there's someone better to host
this program that doesn't look as bad as
you and has nicer things to say
regarding anything I really hope I don't
click on your video again and I'm sure
most people agree with this I used to
like watching these videos but here
lately I'm getting tired of Linus and
his god complex hyper inflated ego and
unbearable narcissism and rudeness his
YouTube fame has gone straight to his
head who's the assistant now but have a
little humility and modesty bro you
don't have to try your hardest to
patronize embarrass and berate your
employees shut up yeah shut up
what kind of man doesn't have a hammer
in his toolkit everybody you have in the
show already knows that you're the boss
and the owner and it's all about you you
you
so give people a break man or you're
going to start losing employees and even
followers eventually because I've
watched some of your older videos Linus
and you didn't used to act like such a
dick when you first started making
content I look forward to the day the
father of three removes his teenage
earrings you do that hey Linus I'm 69
and love your show
I learn a lot from you and really
enjoying everything personally I don't
care if you're a fruit or not it makes
no difference to me god bless
