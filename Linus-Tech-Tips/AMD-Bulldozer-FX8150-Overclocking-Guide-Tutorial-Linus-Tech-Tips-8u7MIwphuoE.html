the AMD FX 8350 I've got my MSI 990 FX a
GTA V motherboard here the reason I
chose this one over the crosshair 5 was
due to the fact that I really like the
way the BIOS is laid out and I'm
actually going to do a video about click
BIOS 2 which is what they're what
they're calling this particular layout
in an upcoming video it's woops that's
not what I'm into it's pretty cool
though actually just the way that you
navigate around is much much faster than
other EFI BIOS implementations and it's
also much faster than the old way of
doing things which was the traditional
BIOS so I'm very very impressed so far
you can either use the mouse or the
keyboard well I think keyboard a little
bit faster but yeah very very cool so
stay tuned guys remember overclocking on
the FX series chips all of them is quite
easy basically the only settings that
we're really going to be looking at I've
turned off OC Genie I've turned off all
of that automated stuff but we're pretty
much going to be looking at CPU ratio
right here okay and that's not going to
be auto by the time we're done it's 18
by default I'm turning off turbo core
technology as well just so that I don't
have any additional curveballs thrown in
I'm just looking for straight eight
cores all enabled all the same frequency
how high can we overclock I've got my
ddr3 at 1600 megahertz so I'm using
HyperX Genesis from Kingston ok moving
down everything is going to be pretty
default except we're disabling
spread-spectrum and we are going to be
adjusting CPU voltage as needed in order
to get stability at the settings that
we're trying so why don't we go ahead
and change the cpu ratio to 22 and we'll
leave it at default voltage and see what
happens just as a starting experiment
I'll bring you guys along for the ride
for this whole video so you can see how
the overclocking experience is on the FX
series chip boot it up at 4.4 gigahertz
but yeah that definitely wasn't going to
happen at stock voltage so the voltage
is turned up to 1.45 in the BIOS you can
see CPU set is reading quite a bit lower
but they take any software voltage
readings with a huge grain of salt so
I'm going to go ahead and find out if
this particular voltage is at least
somewhat stable before I try to move on
any further so here we're just going to
check task manager really quick make
sure all of the threads are
appropriately loaded which it appears
that they are so if this runs for a
couple minutes what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go back to the BIOS crank
up the speed a little bit more and see
if I can make it very unstable then I'll
scale it back and do more long-term
testing well I made a critical
benchmarking mistake
I started benching without my cat in my
lap which he quickly remedied so now I
will have more luck of course but I
tried at 4.6 gigahertz at the same
voltage settings I was using before 1.45
I didn't have any luck so I cranked the
voltage up a little bit higher just to
see what was the limiting factor in the
overclock and I got a mill post scenario
which I wasn't able to recover from so I
had to do a clear CMOS which meant all
of my settings were restored to factory
default including all my boot settings
and all that which is a good lesson
because I'm about to show you guys why
you should always use overclocking
profiles but we're gonna go ahead and
with everything oh whoops
with everything default I always use my
last overclocking profile for that so
set name we're going to call this
default so I haven't changed any
performance settings I mean I've got my
RAM set to stock timings manually and
I've got my boot settings all correct
I've turned off spread-spectrum so I'm
basically ready for overclocking but I
haven't done anything yet so that means
that if I have to clear this
again what I can do is I can just go
into the profile down here and then I
can load profile six which will get me
back to square one without actually
being completely back to square one
where I have to do things like turn off
the fullscreen logo display for example
alright so let's get back going here and
I'm going to go ahead I'm not gonna put
the CPU voltage quite as high this time
so we're gonna go with 1.4 so I cranked
it up to like 1.5 to see what would
happen but let's go with like one point
four six five which is pretty high
pretty high this is like I would call
this not necessarily 24/7 safe but we'll
have a look at what kind of temperatures
we end up with before we say that for
sure and then let's game for four point
six or four point eight wait no that's
not right four point six gigahertz see
what happens here so here's a quirky
thing that is just it's one of those
things that happens sometimes you can
see we're at four point six gigahertz
now booted into Windows I have increased
the core voltage to one point four eight
something I believe in the BIOS which is
very high like I said before be be
careful increasing voltage like this but
no matter what we did with the voltage
by increasing the multiplier more was
not able to get stability but by
increasing the bus speed now I looted
into Windows so sometimes it is a
combination between BuzzFeed and
multiplier that is going to get you the
best stability now what I did do just to
make sure that memory is not the
limiting factors I turned it down to
1333 megahertz so it's a different
divider so that um yeah so that I can
rule that out as the as the problem if
we do run into stability because
otherwise I'd be overclocking the memory
now I do have a slight overclock on the
hypertransport bus as well as what is it
there's something else that's slightly
overclock now that I've done this but
I'm not going to worry too much about
that so let's go ahead and fire up
prime95 and see if we have any stability
whatsoever at these settings and my
mouse froze it looks like we do not so I
might have a bit of a dud of a chip so
here's a luxury that I have that you
guys
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to try
throwing it in the crosshair five and
I'm going to see if the results I get
are any different right now it looks
like my limit on this particular CPU is
going to be around the four point four
to four point five gigahertz range
alright so here I am in the crosshair
five BIOS and I'm going to try straight
for four point six gigahertz with the
Yugo target CPU frequency four point six
gigahertz with my with one point four
five volts just to see what happens and
then here we go one point four five
volts see what happens and I also made
another critical mistake in benchmarking
I got out of my chair and now there are
two grooming cats in it who don't look
like they are likely to move lo and
behold we have a little bit of stability
at four point six gigahertz so it's
still running I'm going to go ahead and
stop it now and let's see if we can push
it any further on this particular board
well I tried another full multiplier for
four point eight and that was not stable
but I dialed it back point five of a
multiplier to twenty-three and a half
and we're at four point seven and it's
been priming for a little while now now
one thing that makes me kind of
uncomfortable about FX overclocking
right now is I don't really have an
accurate way to monitor processor uh
excuse me
processor temperatures because I know
for a fact that is not right there's no
way with the temperature of the water on
the H 100 that that is anywhere near
right it's got to be significantly
higher than that so that worries me a
little bit so I don't think I want to
push the voltage too much higher given
that one point four or five is the max I
see most others doing right now but
maybe I'll give it a little bit more and
maybe I'll try increasing the bus speed
rather than the multiplier to see how
much closer we can get to that four
point eight gigahertz mark or even the
magic 5 gigahertz who knows well I
accidentally Oh looks like cool and
quiets on but I'll just move this around
to generate some CPU load there you go
I accidentally dialed up the bus speed
faster than I had intended to and we
ended up at four point nine five
gigahertz and it booted into Windows
miraculously so we did run into a bit of
a a bit of a hick
Up We're increasing the multiplier
wasn't getting me the stability I needed
but increasing the bus speed sort of did
but I mean I am not expecting this to
have any manner of stability in prime95
I've expected it to crash by now and it
hasn't so look at that we are up near
the 5 gigahertz mark let's see if we can
get there and let's find out how stable
it is I said I wasn't going to do it but
I did have to give it some more voltage
to get into windows at 5 gigahertz so
here you go we are at 5 gigahertz since
1.47 5 in the bios right now so let's
see if we have any Prime stability
whatsoever I really doubt it but still
fun to see a 5 gigahertz suicide shot so
there you have it in terms of what we
were actually able to achieve with any
stability I'd say 4.8 gigahertz is very
doable thank you for checking out my
