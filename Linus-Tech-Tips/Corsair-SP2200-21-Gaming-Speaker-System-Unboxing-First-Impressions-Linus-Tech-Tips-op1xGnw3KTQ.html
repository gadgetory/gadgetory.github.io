speaker system this is the little
brother to the SP 2500 which I am very
very fond of in which we actually did a
full episode of NCIS tech tips featuring
a guest from corsair who came to tell us
all about the SP 2500 which I like ESP
2200 I haven't tried so I don't know
what I think of it but we are going to
at least have a look at the specs and
the physical appearance today so
specifications okay frequency response
back snap course there is all about
reference sound so that means that
they're trying not to color or or alter
in any way the sound that was intended
by the game developer or movie producer
or whoever it is that happens to be
working on developing audio content so
moving on from there 46 watts total
power measured by an FTC RMS method so
that means you can literally run it at
that entire 46 wats for the entire
lifetime of the product days at a time
probably not the entire lifetime of the
product but days at a time and this will
not burn out or distort in any way shape
or form subwoofer dimensions are nine
point one inch by nine point nine inch
by seven point one inch and sidelight
dimensions well obviously we're going to
see that because were going to open this
up but subwoofer is a six inch sub side
firing ported subwoofer suitable for
desk or floor placement it is 30 watts
which leaves us with 16 watts 8 watts
each for the two satellites so those are
two inch drivers we do not have separate
tweeters on this particular skew and
then there we go 8 watts per satellite
okay three inputs for maximum
flexibility which will see when we open
it up main volume and subwoofer output
control dials on the right satellite
package contents and let's just open
this thing up my entire of
specifications let's just open boxes
that's what we do on this channel SP
2200 speaker systems this appears to be
a guide which shows you how to hook it
up to things including televisions and
that speakers and right speakers and
iPods and head phones and computers
sweet warranty guide not a warranty card
this is a guide and it's long do not
return this product to the store return
it's corsair instead as a retailer I
appreciate those kinds of warnings
because that means we don't have to deal
with it and instead of Corsair deals
with it but the reality of it is if you
want to you can return it to us too
because we're awesome like that and we
take care of our customers at NCIX where
I work for anyone who actually doesn't
know that by now yeah oh yeah my shirt
too sweet okay environmentally friendly
paper packaging love it more
environmentally friendly tinker for me
paper packaging love that too next we
have what appears to be a power cord
because it's heavy yeah yeah there's my
power cord heavy so that is a 17 bolt
2.5 amp power brick that's cables got a
son book see I'm doing the whole package
contents thing without reading it off
the side of the box i'm just unpacking
stuff I'm like yeah we got subwoofer we
got a cable you got some boxes got some
satellite least that's how i would say
it if I was cool I'm not satellite
speakers so we're taking these out you
know what give me a sec off camera I'm
going to take all these plastic bags off
because there's my way okay so we got it
set up just so that cameraman oh my
could audition the SP 22 hundreds a
little bit so here at the back you will
find all the input options so we've got
okay first of all output so you output
to your left speaker as well as your
right speaker using my baby's first plug
look how huge this thing is it's like
ridiculous i love it so that goes in
there and then down here is power in
okay then we have an input so that's
left and right just your standard
standard analog inputs okay and then our
other input is that
we built right into the back of the
right speaker so that's your
three-and-a-half millimeter jack right
there so that i'm using for my iphone
and then the left speaker just has a
wire that runs to be sup okay next we
have one of these which i actually can't
fathom that this is for oh yeah for the
auxiliary input at the front so you have
up to three inputs so that would be
normally I guess what you would use for
your iphone on the other one this guy up
here would go around to the back of your
computer if you were smart okay then it
comes with one of these so you can run
that to whatever other device to happen
to water runoff it and oh there's a
cannot scheme coming up soon I just got
my notification on my phone ok so here
it is 75 bucks on sale at NCIX right now
for that price I'd say the sub
especially is a pretty good value we
played a few different genres of music
and we found the the base quite quite
compact for lack of a better word quite
punchy definitely better than most sub
one hundred dollars haha sub that was a
pun most sub 100 dollar speaker settings
the satellites were a little bit less
impressive especially when compared to
the SP 2500 s but you gotta bear in mind
that that kit costs a regular price more
than double of what this one doesn't
regular price so there are compromises
to be made this one's definitely better
for the space conscious consumer because
it doesn't take up a whole lot of room
and I think that's pretty much
everything I wanted to say about the SP
2200 don't forget to subscribe to linus
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos ooh and special
guest appearances hi Esther hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
