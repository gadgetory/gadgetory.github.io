there's been a lot of talk about a
potential unlock from the 69 50 to the
69 70 now remember graphics card
overclocking for a long time has been
kind of limited like you can hear this
is a 69 70 so the one physical
difference between these cards is an
8-pin connector here whereas this one
has two 6-pin connector so for a long
time we haven't been able to properly
overclock a lower-end card to a
higher-end card for example the GTX 570
has fewer functional units on it than
the GTX 580 you cannot even if you
overclock this 572 the same speed as the
580 it will not have the same
performance now a software unlocking of
the the either usually they're laser-cut
or somehow disabled functional units
software re-enabling seems to be back
there that was most Awkward way of
saying that ever but according to tech
power up the 69 50 should be possible to
unlock to a 69 70 so I have a sample
card here and I just want to go through
the process with you guys and show you
how dead simple it is so I downloaded
the package from tech power up which has
this in it okay so there's wind flash
here I thought I was going to have to do
the flashing do the BIOS update through
the through bootable USB but it looks
like I don't even have to do that
because of this little sort of magic
thing right here so this card has two
bios's it is dual BIOS the 69 50 and the
69 70 both are there labeled one two so
all I had to do was change it to the two
position okay that's the first thing I
had to do and then I have to go to flash
to 69 70
alright then there's some little
instructions here I press any key to
continue flashing in progress please
wait okay please restart your system for
the changes to apply after reboot check
the shader count using the gpu-z
included in this directory so i've
already opened up gpu-z because i wanted
to see okay so
our shaders that's the functional units
I'm talking about more shaders
potentially okay so guys check that out
look closely and we're going to reboot
the computer and see if we have
successfully unlocked this 6950 into a
69 70 and if it really is that easy and
takes only a couple minutes now here's
something really cool about the dual
BIOS on the 60 900 or rather the 69 yeah
I guess all the 6900 series cards so far
have this feature so the dual BIOS
allows you to go oh okay that didn't
work like let's say we get a bunch of
artifacts all over the screen or it's
not stable or whatever we can flash it
back as you can see there was a file
included for that but we could also just
turn the computer off flip the switch to
the one position and go back to our
original bios just like that no problem
at all whereas with with other cards you
can run into issues where you can't you
can't boot anymore because the bios
didn't take and then you got to put in
another card in another slot and boot to
that one and then manually flash the
other one and it can be kind of messy
and a real pain in the ah
pain in something anyway okay so know
don't always ask me this so let's find
out if we have more shaders now hmm no
we don't okay maybe I did something
wrong give me time to figure this out
then all right I have found a different
set of instructions on the tech powerup
website that seems to be quite different
indeed so I've downloaded a BIOS I'm
going to reset with the BIOS which in
the one position instead and see if I
can find a way to make it work this way
so stay tuned guys you're along for the
ride on this one I guess alright so now
we're running wind flash manually or
rather ATI win flash manually so the
instructions say now to load an image so
I'm going to go into the whoops where my
downloads anyway guess I better find
those - downloads there we are okay so
set under and school with this no I
don't think it's there I think it was
under yeah there we go okay so okay we
have the BIOS image there so click load
image followed by program so we're going
to click program please wait flashing is
in process something something something
you're racing V okay this this looks
like it took longer so that's probably a
good sign your V BIOS was programmed
successfully okay cool
you have to reboot the system before the
changes take effect alright I guess
we'll do that so back in moment alright
here we have the moment of truth again
opening up gpu-z here we go here we go
hey hey 15:36
unified shaders check that out so it was
that easy this is not a cherry picked
card in any way shape or form and it is
now according to gpu-z completely
unlocked to 6970 spec so the only thing
to do now once you've unlocked your card
is too extreme metamour chesil is to
find out if it's actually stable so the
only way to do that is to run some
benchmarks run some games and see if you
see any visual artifacts I did do a
video a little while ago where I showed
what an artifact was I don't know what
it was called so unless you are like a
really avid viewer you probably won't
know which one it is but hey if you do
remember the one please post it in the
comments and guys please thumbs up on
that particular comment so that we can
all see what an artifact looks like so
I'm just going to let you guys stick
around while we run at least the first
graphics test here and see if the card
did manage to unlock successfully so far
it looks alright so that is a pretty
cool little tweak and I'm getting some
funny looks from someone else in the
office here he thinks I'm standing here
in my office talking to myself so thanks
for checking out my video on how to
flash the Radeon 6950 bios to the 6970
and yeah make sure the credit goes where
it's due because I am not the one who
came up with this wizard at Tech powerup
is truly a wizard and we all owe him a
great
deal for his gpus ed tool all of his
great reviews that he does over there
and this latest trick which is pretty
phenomenal don't forget to subscribe to
