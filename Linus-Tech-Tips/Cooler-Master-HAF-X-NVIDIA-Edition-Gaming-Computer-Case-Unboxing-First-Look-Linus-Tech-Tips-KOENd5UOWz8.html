warehouse and I had to grab one because
it is a half x nvidia edition case so as
you guys may or may not know from the
extreme buyer's guide that I did on my
NCIX tech tips channel I'm a big fan of
the 1/2 X case I really like it
especially at the time of being released
it was one of the more interesting new
and innovative cases on the market
because it was one of the first to
introduce compatibility for certain
motherboards that are longer than
standard ATX it was also one of the
first cases that are what it was the
first case to take that cool half
appearance and turn it into something
that I would truly consider worthy of
housing an extreme gaming computer so
this cooler masters done a few nvidia
edition cases but this is probably the
slickest looking one and it is the first
high-end nvidia branded case that we've
seen from Coolermaster so you know i'm
actually going to get the cameraman to
know let's do the outside of the box
first and I'm going to open it off
camera because this is going to take a
little while really heavy
ok here irritating holes for water
cooling nine expansion slots for
increased expandability we got cable
management grommets tool free hard drive
slots front 230 millimeter green LED fan
okay we've got nvidia sli certified GPU
cooling system okay this I haven't seen
before
support for USB 3.0 looks like we got
two USB 3.0 slots cable cover for clean
insides and a SATA dock for easy
installation without removing the side
panel let me just see if there's
anything else we're missing here yep
okay
so we got five three and a half inch
drive bays six five and a quarter inch
drive bays two of these whatever these
are okay here's all of our cooling
system stuff and let's go ahead and get
this thing opened up so this is it the
half exit video edition if there was any
doubt from the color scheme still left
in your mind as to whether
this is an nvidia edition case or not
you could probably check right here and
see that there is an nvidia logo right
on the front of it so there let your
doubts be dismissed quite easily okay so
here we got our five and a quarter inch
bay covers of student front of the case
first we've got all of our front io and
whatnot we've got our power switch reset
switch as well as an on/off switch
that's a toggle switch for the fan LED
so you can leave the fan on but actually
turn the lights off if you want to sleep
we've got two USB 3.0 ports one eSATA
one firewire two USB 2.0 front
microphone as well as front headphones
so lots of different io options here at
the front I can't remember if this does
anything on the half X it would appear
that it doesn't so that is the front why
don't we have a look at the top so in
the top of the case we've got two
cooling fans which are each measured at
approximately yeah I'm checking 200
millimeters so those are - those are
dual 200 millimeter fan mounts in the
top of the case and I'm going to go
ahead and move it around to this side so
on the side we've actually got another
200 millimeter fan now here we go okay
stop right there and that actually comes
with a fan pre mounted in it so that's
going to provide all the cooling you
could possibly need to your high-end
GeForce graphics card that you ought to
be installing in a case like this you
can see the window actually has some
NVIDIA artwork on it as well
and it is a green tinted window rather
than being a straight clear window so
here if I can if I stick my hand in here
you can see the color difference between
my hand behind the green glass and my
hand not behind the green glass so let's
twist it around again
oh it's heavy though steel construction
it weighs I tell you okay at the back of
the case we find our water cooling
grommets we find a 140 millimeter fan
with optional 120 millimeter mount so
that means if you wanted to install
something like a corsair age 70 you
would have the option to do that more
ventilation holes next to our nine PCI
expansion slots and
standard bottom-mounted ATX power supply
make up the back of the case on the
other side we find a fairly traditional
relatively speaking side panel so it has
a 1/2 X look to it that is the side
panel has some shape to it some
definition and then we find design by
cooler master which is besides this
little tiny logo on the box which is way
down here at the bottom the only cooler
master branding on this entire product
and packaging so next thing that we will
do is give me a second off camera to get
these screws loosened okay I got it
there we go so I'm taking the first side
panel off and then in a moment since we
can't really see a whole lot from this
side why don't we do the cable
management aspect first so we've got a
whole year that's going to allow us to
take any power supply cables we want to
run up the back so say two cables over
to the drives say two cables over to the
other drives so there's actually here
you guys should see this because the
other side panel came off okay there's
the fan and the duct that goes on it to
make sure that all of the air flow is
directed at your graphics cards alright
so we're not going to spend too much
time on that but I also want to show you
this gap right here so if you want to
bring a cable up from the bottom you can
actually run it up here to your optical
drive as well so that's going to make
sure that cable stays nice and hidden
we've got a cutout at the back of the
motherboard tray that's going to allow
us to install and uninstall any
backplate requiring CPU coolers without
actually taking the motherboard out of
the case so we've got a couple nice
silicone grommets here you can see these
are nice high-quality grommets when I go
and press on them they actually snap
right back into place
and we've got our yes here we go so
here's the LED power for our front fan
so that is controlled by that switch at
the top and then here's the actual fan
power which we can either plug in via a
three pin or via the three pin to 4-pin
molex adapter that Coolermaster includes
with the case or should I say in video
please
case very hard to say all right in here
this looks like it's going to get
complicated in a hurry why don't we
start at the top right and work our way
to the back so here we have our two
lists five and a quarter inch retention
mechanism here we have a box which if I
can figure out how to remove it that
would be great
there we are so I'm probably going to
contain some accessories here we've got
all of our front panel connectors so I'm
not going to bother taking those out but
I think you guys get the point there is
one thing I do want to see though here
ah yes it looks like we're still doing
USB 3 via the non header approach so
you're gonna have to take your USB 3
cables run them out the back of the case
maybe through a PCI bracket and plug
them into the back of your motherboard
everything else in here the front
firewire the front audio the front USB
is all pretty standard and you can see
the colors of the cables here front
eSATA is right there
ok so then moving down here are our
little two front SATA bays okay so those
are going to be running off a little
backplane here there's your power
there's your two SATA interfaces so I'm
gonna actually show you guys really
quick how that works once I figure it
out oh there that's how it works so you
can either mount you've got two and a
half inch mounting holes or three to
half inch mounting holes on there and it
looks like this Bay also functions in
much the same manner so I want you to
hear you can get in there and you can
see that's what that little circuit
board connects to so I'm going to go
ahead and throw these back in so
remember that's in addition to the tool
list drive bays that are located down
here so we're going to work our way down
here closer to the bottom of the case so
you got those two plus these five now
these look flimsy I'll be the first to
tell you guys that actually it looks
less flimsy when you got in here look at
this they look flimsy as soon as you put
a hard drive in here these things
stiffen right up and once you put it
back in with the hard drive you have
utter confidence
that it's not going anywhere you can see
this one also comes with a two and a
half inch adapter so natively this case
can support up to two two and a half
inch drives here and an additional one
with the adapter included with your top
drive slits that's pretty nice to see
all right moving closer to the back of
the case actually here let's have a look
up into the top so that's where our 200
millimeter fan goes you can see we've
got one installed and then one more
optional one over on the other side
there see see you can throw another one
in there okay here's that little duct
thing that was on the outside of the box
so I guess the theory is that when you
have a graphics card installed I happen
to have a graphics card handy here this
well that that won't necessarily work
very well if your graphics card is
installed in the very top of your
motherboard so now let's not worry too
much about that but I think the point of
that duct is basically to direct as much
airflow as possible at the graphics
cards from this front fancy intake from
the front and there's actually another
120 millimeter fan built into that duct
and that's going to blow air directly at
your graphics cards here is the little
cable cover so you install your power
supply and you can point your power
supply with the fan drawing air up from
the bottom because this is mesh down
here so it's not going to suffocate okay
and then you've got a little cover here
so you can grow cables up here you can
route cables out behind the motherboard
tray you can rub cables out over here
and it's going to cover up that that
little messy portion like this that
comes right out of your power supply
directly so you won't be able to see
that and you know what I think that
actually pretty much covers everything I
have to say about the half x NVIDIA
dition there's that 140 film yield and
millimeter fan at the back and then
other than that you've got rubber feet
on the bottom and I think that's it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the half x nvidia edition don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos yeah I forgot to show
you what's in this box so we've got all
of our mounting hardware for motherboard
drives and other
things we've got an adapter to turn
those two front USB threes into
internally header driven USB twos we've
got some zip ties okay we've got an 8
pin extension cable so if your power
supply doesn't have a long enough 8 pin
connector which Coolermaster is pretty
much anticipated it won't they've
included an adapter for you ok we've
also got this oh yeah I remember what
this is so this goes here somewhere and
then is used to support your graphics
cards yeah that's it okay and then we
also have some included casters so you
can install those on the bottom of the
case and then you can roll it around
because like I said it's pretty friggin
heavy even without hardware installed
there we go now we're actually done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
