unboxing for a pretty unique product
this is the msi n4 65 gtx twin frozer 2
golden edition so this is an all copper
design for the cooler that's one of the
big things about this card but there's a
couple other things as well it's got a
three year warranty in Canada in the
u.s. it uses their military class
concept of components including their
tantalum capacitors solid state chokes
meaning no buzzing under load four cards
that do feature that that particular
aspect of military class as well as
solid capacitors which they claim a
minimum of a 10-year lifetime for it
does support all of your typical Nvidia
functionality such as CUDA SLI including
3-way SLI physics as well as 3d vision
including 3d vision surround it has one
gig of gddr5 it has voltage adjustment
via MSI Afterburner software and I think
I was going to say something else no I
was not alright so here's another little
outline of the military class components
so here's the no buzz thing I was
talking about so with wring chokes you
can get kind of a high-pitched vibration
or it can sound like a squeal it's very
very obnoxious if you've ever had a card
that that that does this you'll know
what I'm talking about
whereas with a solid-state choke you do
not hear it and I've used a couple of
MSI's military class cards already and I
have observed that I do not get any
whining noises from them whatsoever so
this is a direct contact ok here we're
talking mostly about the cooler so why
don't we take the card out first and
then we'll talk about the cooler while
we can actually look at it that would be
better
has a black box black boxes always nerds
can I have to say first of all I am
quite disappointed um it did say golden
Edition and it turned out that it was
made of copper so I was really hoping
that this card would weigh like you know
90 pounds but it's getting up there this
probably weighs about as much as as
almost any other graphics card I've
encountered I'd estimate that's had a
good four pounds for that card let's
have a look at the accessories that are
included we've got two molex to one PCIe
6 pin connector on mini HDMI to HDMI
connector and another two molex to 6-pin
PCI II connector and then underneath we
have some other stuff we have a quick
user's guide a DVI to HDMI adapter DVI
to VGA adapter their afterburner
software and it says hey download the
latest version right here that's what to
do Emma sighs got that figured out
alright and then what else do we have
here this is how to use their live
update software to update your drivers
okay cool so let's get the card out here
and this thing weighs so much up awesome
God looks like it's using either a
reference PCB or a slightly modified one
it's hard for me to say right now
because it does have a twin frozer
cooler on it but you can see on the back
it has the hole for the for the stock
fan so I'm not sure whether they've
altered the PCB I don't have a gtx 465
with me here on the park bench to
compare against i'm going to just take
off this little cover on the pci
for us MSI does these little covers on
everything that's very unique to them
okay so these are individually numbered
I actually don't know how many they
produced but let's uh let's take a look
at let's look at the overall card layout
and then we'll look at the cooler much
closer near the end so first of all this
is a PCI Express 2.0 16 X card that's
your typical thing as I mentioned before
you've got support for two-way as well
as 3-way SLI with this particular card
you've got your msi branding up here on
the top with your twin frozer 2 as well
as your unique number and then we have
two 6-pin PCI II power connectors this
is quite a power-hungry card because it
is based on the Fermi architecture let's
move around to the bottom so this is a
four pin PWM fan that is using a little
adapter to run two fans off the one
header here on the video card moving
around to the back yeah here we go a
limited offer number 698 so this is card
number 698 out of all of the golden
edition cars they produced and on the
back we find a custom IO shield with MSI
logo on it as well as some other vents
for air to come out and then we've got a
mini HDMI as well as two DVI ports now
this colored is not going to exhaust all
of the air directly out of the back of
the case but it will do some so you'd
see the fins are actually like I can I
don't know how to give you guys a good
angle at this thing it looks really cool
but it's hard to heart to really
demonstrate it okay so you see the fins
run this way right so what happens is
when the fans blow down
it means the airflow is either going to
go that way or that way so basically a
small portion of the airflow from this
fan will be exhausted directly out of
the case whereas from this fan it's all
going to end up in your case as long as
you have good at case air flow this
isn't going to be a problem but if you
don't have good case airflow then you
can run into a little bit of trouble and
I want to really look at the way the
heat pipes are positioned on this cooler
because I think this is really clever
they've got five heat pipes directly
over the GPU core so if you look down
there you can see right where the GPU is
right there and
three of these are six millimeter heat
pipes and two of them are MSI's eight
millimeter super pipes so what the super
pipes do is they're positioned at both
of the outside edges and they carry the
heat away the furthest from the GPU
itself so what that means is that
wherever it's sort of cast to cover a
much greater distance they're using
super pipes so that you can still take
advantage of the copper fins that are
over here and over here at the very
edges of the cooler actually oh yeah
that's one of the things that they do
have on here another thing that they're
using is a what was I going to say okay
I'll just say the next thing I was going
to say okay so the middle heat pipe you
can see here goes right to the middle of
the cooler so that one is the one that
goes directly over the GPU core and it's
able to take advantage of therefore a
little air flow from both of these fans
and I guess I'll just let you kind of
look at this for a little bit because
it's really cool the way that they lay
out the heat pipes with all five of them
carrying heat two completely different
parts of this cooler so that you can
really take advantage of this huge
copper block I mean it's basically a
brick of copper on top of this card let
me see if there's anything else that we
should talk about briefly here
high-density heatsink okay that makes a
lot of sense oh yeah I should mention
that even though this is an extremely
heavy extremely high-end cooler it's
still only a dual slot design so you
don't have to worry about taking up an
additional slot next to your graphics
card another thing that should be noted
and this is kind of okay this is a bit
of an odd design choice but you see the
shroud that they've put over top with
your serial number as well as the MSI
branding it actually goes back a little
bit further than the video card itself
so make sure you've got enough room in
your case to install this card because
it is a touch longer than a regular gtx
465 now MSI claimed that this cooler is
up to sixteen degrees cooler and up to
21 degrees our 21 decibels quieter then
the stock GTX 460 v cooler and we will
take a look at what kind of temps we can
get out of it but I think that pretty
much covers everything I wanted to say
that
is the msi gtx 465 twin frozer two
golden edition graphics card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
