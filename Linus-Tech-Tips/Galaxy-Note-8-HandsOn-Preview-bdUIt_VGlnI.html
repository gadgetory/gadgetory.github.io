so we're hands-on with the Galaxy Note 8
which is an upcoming tablet from Samsung
it's part of their note series which
means you get all of those note
optimized features things like the
included stylus or the whatever it's
called the S Pen I think is what Samsung
likes to call a stylus as well as the
full digitizer built into the display
itself so that's going to be extremely
useful for users who want more than just
the on/off functionality that you get
with most touchscreens
so instead you're actually able to apply
distinctly different amounts of pressure
so it's great for for sketching for
things like what else I think I gave a
couple examples when I did this
rehearsal but I can't remember any of
them now the point is that if you want
to draw on your tablet if you want it to
be useful for more than just for artists
you know if you're on the go you want to
draw something and you want to actually
move that over to computer later I know
for example here at tech tips we'd love
to have a tablet with the digitizer
because when we're doing things like
storyboarding for episodes
it'd be great to be able to draw on
something that looks a little bit more
sophisticated than just lines in terms
of performance it's going to have a
quad-core a9 it's an 8-inch tablet so
you've got a 1280 by 800 resolution so
you can watch 720p HD content in its at
native resolution but 1080p content
would be down scaled the overall look at
the device is pretty much it's got a
white back this particular one although
I guess actually I have no idea if it's
gonna be available in different colors
so I'm not gonna promise anything but
this is white backs and it basically
looks like a gigantic galaxy s3 white
because you got your rear camera here
you got microSD expansion here on the
side and then that's pretty much it for
the back your headphone jack is on the
top of the device right here and then
moving down this side you've got your
unlock your volume rocker moving down to
the bottom that's where the s-pen is
stashed and what's cool about the s-pen
is it's not just a storage pocket here
it actually opens up the relevant
applications when you open it and close
it so you can see you pop that back in
and it goes back to the home screen also
on the bottom you've got Samsung's
charging station stair
Oh speakers I would love to see more
tablet manufacturers move towards stereo
speakers preferir preferably optimized
for landscape content viewing but I mean
hopefully that's something that we'll
see sort of moving more forward in the
future it's certainly better than
something like you know my old iPad 2
which is what I'm still using day-to-day
which has one speaker on the back of the
device so at least we're moving in the
right direction here on the front you've
just got your light sensor as well as
your front camera and then the usual one
hard button for the home button and then
back and contacts fuel's
we're really excited to bring you guys
sort of more information about this
little tablet sometime in the future
when we get our hands on a working one
as you may or may not have noticed the
jellybean OS that's on this particular
one here it has this yellow text all
over it that actually doesn't go away
because this is not a finished device
yet so I just wanted to show you guys
what it looks like in terms of size so
I'll do my trademark iPhone for
comparison I'm getting evil looks from
all the Samsung folks in the room here
for for pulling out an iPhone and
they're in they're in there sweet but
I'm sorry guys I'm sorry I had to do it
I do it every time people expect it from
me
so the actual thickness is is pretty
similar to something like like this
device and the feel is not super light
like we've had with even previous
Samsung devices so the Galaxy Tab 10.1
is the one that I actually still use
day-to-day for a Samsung tablet and had
quite a light feel to it this one uses a
bit of a denser plastic and it feels
like a thick piece of glass you can you
can tell there's there's no there's no
flex to the device it is a little bit
more solid I personally don't mind this
it's one of the things I like about the
iPhone 4 compared to other smartphones
is it actually has some heft to it it
feels like something that you're not
just going to kind of go wah and drop
all over the place so it comes down to
the individual user how they feel about
that but overall construction feels
solid and I really look forward to
showing you guys more about this don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and apparently I mean it's sort
of a computer but mobile device videos -
couple key things that I actually missed
before and this I was I was tinkering
with the screen I was pressing on it and
I was going oh this doesn't look like an
LCD it looks like this is I
their mo led or super mo led it's it's
not an LCD display which is extremely
exciting because this is one of the
larger format organic LED displays that
I've yet encountered looks absolutely
beautiful I mean the viewing angles are
outstanding and the other thing that I
missed before is that is an IR emitter
which means that you should be able to
use this as a universal remote
among all the other functionalities that
you can enable with an IR emitter most
of which the universal remote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
