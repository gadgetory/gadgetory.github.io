that I have been eagerly awaiting in the
mail it's not a computer part but it is
a personal purchase I grabbed a blade
MSR remote-control helicopter ok I got
it from great hobbies I've actually
shopped there a few times it's been
overall a good experience their websites
decent you know the shipping times are
pretty fast so it's a pretty pretty good
ok so it doesn't say a whole lot about
this on the box but what it does say is
that it's perfect for anyone who's flown
oblate CX 3 or mcx it's a hundred
percent factory assembly test flown
assembled assembled test flown and ready
to fly it has a unique rotor head
designed to provide nimble response plus
positive stability that's one of the
ones that I was after because I'm not a
great heli pilot but I have spent a lot
of time in the sim so I'm looking for
something that I can grow into and from
what I've heard about this heli it's OK
for beginners but there's a lot of room
to grow into it so that's pretty cool
it does require a four-channel 2.4
gigahertz dsm2 transmitter which is sold
separately and it includes a four port
charger now it also says here it comes
with everything that you need to get
going except for the transmitter you can
even use such as the such as this such
as comes with a couple spare parts it
advertises some optional
glow-in-the-dark weighing in a weighs in
at under one else which is pretty cool
ok anyway let's get this thing opened up
I'm gonna point the point the camera
sort of more at the couch here and we
can get this box up at this time there
we go ok so inside the first thing we
will find is the BNF instruction manual
so that stands for bind and fly which
means that it's ready to go all you need
is a transmitter the RTF ones are mean
ready to fly and they do come with a
transmitter ok
additional smart smart bind information
so here's a little bit of info about
making sure that it's bound properly to
your receiver ok or I start you to your
transmitter prior to me okay there's the
BNF instruction manual it's quite thick
but what I'm going to assume is that wow
no it's not even a whole lot of
languages let me see this might be
strictly English yeah that's a beefy
manual there you can see there's a whole
lot of info going on
they're all right better make sure I
read that important read manual for full
safety and warranty information but this
seems to be a quickness
it is a QuickStart guide so it includes
a QuickStart guide on how to quickly
bind it initialize the aircraft and etc
etc alright then you've got an
instruction manual for the charger that
comes with it this is awesome because I
had a it parks on vapor before that came
with I believe the same kind of
batteries as this heli but the
difference was that it came with like
this fail charger that didn't have an AC
to DC adapter which is here the next
thing I'm going to take out of the box
and all it had was the ability to run
off double-a batteries so basically
you're charging your a little lithium
polymer batteries here off of doublea's
I mean that's stupid charging a battery
off another battery so this one comes
with a nice four port charger so you can
plug in up to four of these batteries
which is great because I have a couple
already the one that came with my vapor
I bought a spare the one that came with
my SM 26 I think it's called got another
plane but yeah so you can charge four of
these at a time and you can run it
either off an AC adapter or you can fill
it up with batteries should you require
that which is like just oh I mean I
guess that's great if you're at the know
I guess that's great if you're at the
park or whatever okay it also comes with
some spare parts here so I believe it
outlines all of the spare parts that
comes with on the outside of the box but
I could yeah okay so it includes a spare
tail rotor spare fly bar for spare body
grommets and a handy swash plate
calibration tool so that is what we will
find inside just gonna show you what we
got here so there's them here are some
grommets and then we've got
oh wow these are really small parts but
it be careful with this there's your
spare tail rotor okay there's a little
screwdriver thanks guys just in case you
don't have a screwdriver okay then yeah
whatever this is this might be the
calibration tool not actually sure and
then we've
a couple little guys here okay there we
go
so that's all of the parts included with
the blade MSR and then the last thing of
course is the heli itself as I said
before it weighs in at less than one
ounce and the overall length I think
they also list that on here is 7.9
inches or 20 centimeters so it's a 20
centimeter long heli you can see that
okay so let's start with the road the
main rotor up at the top so it's gonna
spin this way and you can see that the
way it's designed these actually move a
little bit one of the demo videos I saw
of this particular heli actually showed
them crashing it into a door and then
picking it up putting it back on the
floor and flying it again so the way
they're advertising this is that it's
supposed to be quite durable and
actually the guy at at the hobby store
great hobby said that probably I'm more
likely to break things like the tail
rotor and less likely to break the main
rotor okay so you can see down here
you've got all of these sensitive
electronics inside the helicopter there
try and get you a good look at all of
that okay and then here's a look from
the other side I wish I could fly this
thing for you but I'm like not wanting
to necessarily bust it up and I'm just
in a basement here with flaking
eight-foot ceilings so yeah like I said
I'm not a great heli pilot by any
stretch of the imagination down at the
bottom here you can see there's a little
housing for the battery to fit into and
I wish I knew more about this thing but
I did not as much research as I probably
should have anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the blade
MSR oh yeah here's the transmitter I'm
going to be using for my trusty dx7 and
I hope to get back to you guys with
something that isn't a horror crash
