viewers Choice we looked back at our
Amazon affiliate data to see what you
yes you Thomas
Bullock actually bought since New Year's
Eve and had a look at what kind of PC
that you could build out of the most
popular parts and this time was really
interesting not only because of intel's
coffee lake launch that's six core cpus
for the masses a mere seven years after
AMD did it but also because ram prices
have been so stupid and cryptocurrency
broke the GPU market like bad i cannot
believe how much some of you had to pay
for a graphics card it's like actually
depressing
cheer up linus why you got a sponsor oh
wait
cuz today's video is brought to you by
i'm not sure yet let's go with p i a
private Internet access is the VPN that
gives you a secure IP and hides your
online activity you can check it out now
at the link in the video description
so as much as people moaned and groaned
when coffee lake was announced I mean it
had been less than a year since KB Lake
and it had its own new chipset that was
a requirement it looks like a lot of you
were ready for an upgrade because the
core i7 8700 K was far and away the most
popular chip this quarter but given its
big performance bump over previous
products that's not nearly as surprising
as the way that the most popular chips
previously the i7 7700 K and i-5 7600 K
have been knocked way back by a red sea
of risin processors occupying half of
the top spots overall Andy has actually
managed to completely catch up to Intel
in CPU market share at least as far as
our viewers and what they buy on Amazon
is concerned so Wow
great job AMD onto motherboards silver
metal went to AZ 370 board with support
for all of those 8th gen Intel chips
that you guys are buying but when you
look at the price you pay to go Intel an
average of $200 for that board I guess
it makes sense that the top-selling
motherboard was actually for AMD's
socket am for the asus rog Strix b 350f
gaming with a similar but more expensive
variant this guy coming in third place
also from a sous fun fact the first non
AC sport doesn't appear until sixth
place in cooler land we've got the the
forever champ of coolers cooler master
hyper 212 evo the cooler that tripled
the sales of the runner-up in our last
episode has been beaten by none other
whoops then the course
h100 iv2 all-in-one liquid cooler could
it be the RGB logo on the pump yeah it's
probably on two ran sadly our audience
hasn't been spared the jacked up prices
Corsairs to buy eight gigs 3000
megahertz vengeance kit was the best
selling this time and last june and if
you guys are looking at this going well
there's a ram shortage because you guys
have got all of it well what we've had
all this stuff for a long time since it
was way cheaper this kit was an average
of 75 dollars less
last June of course they're somehow
managed to get us a hundred and twenty
eight gigs of their vengeance RGB it's
not entirely possible that we are
single-handedly causing the continuation
of the global DRAM shortage so sorry
about that which I guess is a good segue
into GPU prices which have also been
inflated due to demand from
cryptocurrency miners while we're used
to seeing nvidia gtx 1070 and 1080 cards
on the podium this time around people
mostly bought 10 60's and specifically
from EVGA but were the people buying
them gamers well the absence of an
uptick in 1060 usage in the Steam
Hardware survey over the same period
would seem to indicate that no no they
were not so does that mean that all of
those cards were bought by miners not
necessarily but consider that all but
two of them were bought on the same day
in January and that one person bought
four and that the 1060 doesn't support
four-way SLI and all right then
so then did any gamers buy a new GPU and
2018 well looks like they tried the
third most popular card was actually a
gtx 1070 inside a gigabyte horas gaming
box EG
pee-yew for about 600 bucks so those
folks had to pay for and presumably
discard a thunderbolt enclosure that
they probably didn't want but hey I mean
other people were paying anywhere from
500 to 900 dollars for just the card so
yeah
bt-dubs if you're wondering if AMD's
vega made a big splash oops there it is
well only seven of them actually sold
this quarter at least in our Amazon data
so probably that's due to short supply
now let's take a look at monitors it
appears that you guys either wanted to
spend around 500 bucks for a high
refresh rate gaming monitor like a
really an ultra wide one so it looks
like it's the 144 Hertz LG 34 you see 79
G dash B which I guess kind of makes
sense since it merges two of the
features that you guys have indicated
are the most important to you in a
display so anyway you either spent a lot
on a gaming monitor or you think a
monitor is a monitor as a monitor and
you bought a 21 and a half inch HP
Pavilion the best-selling monitor on
Amazon for a mere 85 bucks that actually
looks like a good deal maybe we should
take a closer look at this thing let us
know in the comments below anyway
speaking of cheap stuff that seems to be
your preference when it comes to
peripherals to keyboards and mice from
red dragon have been absolutely smashing
the competition ever since we did those
budget round ups and now the same thing
is happening to headsets everyone was
buying the HyperX twos forever and ever
until we did our cheap headphone roundup
and now they're in 15th place with a
mere 7% of the sales volume of the be
excellent GM ones now in case you were
during the top-selling chassis haha come
on come on come back I'm sorry I know
I've used that joke before
just kidding I'm not sorry I'm gonna do
it again anyway the top seller was the
fantex eclipse p400s and I mean why not
it's got a touch of RGB a splash of
tempered glass and it comes in a bunch
of different colors at a fair price
what's not to like the most popular fan
was the Noctua NF f12 which half of you
opted to get in black completely
reasonable and the other half went for
this which I guess is also sort of
reasonable and then an honorable mention
goes to the Corsair light loupe 120s
that just came out last year they took
the bronze medal with they're super
modern
not to mention incredibly expensive dual
RGB look over in storage land there was
an upset nvme and dot two SSDs one for
the first time ever with 250 and 500 gig
samsung 960 Evo's topping the list even
though they still cost 50% more than
Samsung's two and a half inch runners-up
I'm attributing the wind to the price
difference now being small enough to
make the speed gains and space savings
appealing to mainstream people with
notebook upgrades also seeming like a
likely driver of this category for
spinning discs the WD 1 terabyte blue is
still on top but interestingly sales of
8 terabyte drives tripled compared to
last time and while I might have
initially assumed that this was to do
with people using octane memory which is
a good value way to accelerate an
internal hard drive it seems like this
blip has more to do with one particular
model going on sale because upon closer
inspection it's an external drive anyway
finally who could forget the power
supply here
you've got another first EVGA supernova
650 g3 80 plus gold fully modular PSU
took the chicken dinner
so gold efficiency is finally going
mainstream so then can we actually make
a compatible PC out of the winning parts
this time the answer is no thanks to
that pesky a.m. for motherboard or Intel
CPU depending on how you look at it but
if it were compatible the system would
actually be almost exactly the same
price as last time and considerably
faster in some tasks thanks to the extra
couple of processing course though it
should be noted that it would be quite a
bit slower in games because of the
massive video card downgrade so
hopefully by the next time we do one of
these the market conditions will have
improved somewhat the master op 67 key
meet oh my - I know thank you
the master op 67 key might old laser
Ultima Kanaka board features a
mechanical frame a cool retro look gmk
laser key caps and you can choose a case
color laser dusk or laser dawn you can
swap switches with no soldering required
the keys are fully programmable via qmk
firmware it's got dual USB C connectors
and custom RGB backlighting and
under-lighting check it out and learn
more at the mass drop link below so
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one without holes
and our community forum which you should
