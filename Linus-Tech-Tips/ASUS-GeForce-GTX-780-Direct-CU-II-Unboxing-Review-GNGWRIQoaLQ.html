video description to learn more welcome
to my unboxing and overview of the
geforce gtx 780 direct cu2o see from a
soos so let's go ahead and see what they
have to say for themselves on the front
of the box anyway a 20% cooler vastly
quieter and this we believe because like
the last asus card overview we did we
have already taken it out of the box and
we've already run it through the paces
so yes we believe it OC edition okay
it's not overclocked much but the
advantage isn't necessarily in the
factory overclock but rather in the fact
that because of the design of this
particular card it runs more efficiently
and runs cooler which allows GPU boosts
2.0 which remember reacts not only to
power thresholds as well as clock speed
but also to temperature so it allows GPU
boost to to dynamically increase the
clock speed of this graphics card it's
using a fully custom PCB so that
includes their digi+ power so that's
their vrm design as well as their s AP
components of super alloy power
components this gives effectively better
overclocking when you use their GPU
tweak software which works with any asus
graphics card particularly this one
because we found it works very very well
so one of the things that asus has done
with this card is they have moved away
from something that's been a bit of a
staple for them well that was fun um and
that is the triple slot design of their
very high-end cards this is a dual slot
card but hold on I'm getting ahead of
myself
it comes with an sli bridge it comes
with a dual 6 pin 2 8 pin adapter and it
comes with their GPU tweak and driver
which you should ignore and download the
latest often video comm and a Seuss's on
website as well as a QuickStart guide so
let's look at the card physically now
it'll be obvious to anyone who's seen a
reference 780 that this isn't one but
let's go through a few of the things
that make it non reference number one it
has a backplate so this backplate
doesn't contribute much to cooling let's
be honest with ourselves what it does do
is it looks cool and other than that it
prevents sagging so it actually makes
the card more rigid and less likely to
flip down like we've seen with heavy
graphics cards in the past now I
mentioned already the dual fan
configuration and dual slot
configuration but there are some other
special things about it so number one is
check this out
this is their new cool tech fan design
so instead of just being focused on
blowing air down into the heatsink fins
you can see a soos has built up the
cooler around the outside edges of the
fan so you can see there are aluminum
fins here and yeah and this fan is
designed to not only blow down but also
out so that means you're able to take to
make better use of the heatsink fins
that are all around the fan now the
secondary cooling found the one that
doesn't sit directly over top of the GPU
uses their more traditional style now
the cooler itself in order to even get
any benefit from more airflow and
cooling Japan different from where floor
whatever I'm trying to segue here all
right so the cooler itself has another
unique feature check this out that right
there my friends is a 10 millimeter heat
pipe this is the largest I have ever
seen on a graphics card MSI's old super
pipe marketing that I don't really see
them using much anymore referred to
eight millimeter heat pipes of which
this card has two so there are two eight
millimeter heat pipes 110 millimeter
heat pipe and then it looks like two six
millimeter heat pipes so there are five
total heat pipes carrying heat away from
the GPU core to the massive cooler on
the rest of this card now speaking of
massive coolers there is a very very
very small PCB extension right here but
it doesn't add a significant amount of
overall length to the card not like we
see with cards like the GTX 780 X 670
where it has like a massive plastic
overhang that isn't actually part of the
components there are LED indicators for
the PCI Express slot so you can actually
diagnose if there's any kind of a power
delivery issue with the board itself and
it has full support for VGA Hotwire so
this right here is a PCI Express 3.0
interface
nothing to do with VG hotwire except
that if you put that interface into a
supported asus motherboard generally
speaking it's there rog boards you can
actually over volt the GPU and various
components on the video card in ways
that nvidia never really intended a
seuss doesn't advertise this feature on
their boxes because nvidia doesn't like
it but there you go the feature is there
I have confirmed it it is supported
now speaking of supported features it's
got support for 3d vision surround with
two HDMI outputs and two HDMI to DVI
outputs an HDMI output and a DisplayPort
output you're going to get a little bit
of exhaust out the back of the case but
generally speaking this is an internal
exhaust card so you're gonna want to
make sure you have good case airflow it
has two sli connectors with full support
for nvidia sli up to three or even four
way however four-way just really isn't
that recommended these days at the back
of the card you've got two PCI Express
connectors one of them is a six pin and
one of them is an eight pin and then
other than that that's it for
connectivity what more did you guys
really want were you expecting it to
have like you know an anchor port so
that you could actually use it as an
anchor because it's quite heavy and
there's a good reason for that because
in terms of the actual overall heatsink
mass available for dissipating heat this
thing has about double what a stock gtx
780 does now we were a little bit
worried about the complexity of removing
the graphics card cooler from this card
but part of what a soos I mean just
looking at all these little screws that
it seems like we can access but part of
what Asus takes pride in with their
directs to you cards is this easy
disassembly four screws on the back of
the GPU right there and that reveals the
direct contact copper heat pipe so you
can actually see the nickel plating
isn't even on this part direct copper to
GPU you can see that 10 millimeter heat
pipe those two eight millimeter heat
pipes as well as those two six mil heat
pipes all branching out to various parts
of the cooler itself here alright so you
can see why that primary fan is
considered the primary fan as well
because most of where asus is carrying
the heat
ten mill pipe is right here under the
primary fan this eight and this six mill
are sitting right under the primary fan
as well as any heat that is carried
through conduction directly by this
block of copper and aluminum here will
sit directly under that fan as well so
the secondary one is only really getting
some of the ten Mills heat as well as
one six and one eight both of which are
carrying heat quite far away from the
GPU which does reduce their
effectiveness now that we've got the
cooler off we can also see part of what
makes this card tick now this is an
overclocked card a reference gtx 780
only gets a clock speed of around 863
slash 904 boost and this one's at 889
941 however there's more to it than that
because of sears of erm heatsink as well
as their super alloy power components
but the advantage that this card gets is
because it's more efficient and stays
within its power limits more effectively
it actually is able to achieve around
1032 megahertz typical boost clock on
average from what asus has seen without
any overclocking that means even at
stock speeds this card should be faster
than what they're really saying about it
on the box which is very very cool let's
go ahead and show you the rest of the
components that are on the PCB itself
first of all mat PCB so a soos two
thumbs up
good job guys you guys Rock three gigs a
six gigabyte I'm six games six it three
gigs not six gigs I was head Titan on
the brain they're three gigs of six
gigahertz gddr5 memory so that's pretty
much the same as any other gtx 780
however it is also getting the benefit
of their digital power delivery in much
the same way that the GPU itself does so
I think that pretty much wraps it up
except what does all this mean in the
real world I just gave you a whole bunch
of Asus marketing speak but does this
card actually overclock better than a
reference card boom here's a couple
graphs so in our experience yes we were
actually able to overclock the direct
cu2 card better than we were able to
overclock our reference card your
mileage may vary it's possible we got a
fantastic direct CO 2 although asus
tells us ours is pretty average it's
possible that we've got a bunk GTX 780
scarred however when NVIDIA seeds those
cards to reviewers I don't think they
kick all the bunk ones to send to
reviewers so take it with a grain of
salt but that's what we think about it
leave us a comment under the video
what do you hear is what I want to know
what do you think Asus could have
improved about the GTX 780 directs you
to for me they've addressed the triple
slot issue which was a problem for me
they've I mean yeah okay what could be
improved also like the video guys share
the video and as always don't forget to
