room it's some crazy cooling experiment
usually with you the aircon is good in
here which is and that actually probably
makes sense because this room isn't big
enough for us to actually hold meetings
in here anymore
and because we're at it yet again this
right here is a bizarre cooling product
this is the icy graphite thermal pad the
last thermal interface you will ever
need they claim that this thermal pad
performs as well as thermal taste it is
extremely durable so it could last for
decades and it's reusable let's
investigate shall we after I tell you
about private Internet access
P ia is the VPN service that encrypt all
of your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP and it's got lots of other
useful features as well you can check it
out at the link below
oh well it conducts heat yeah really
well especially in the XY alright so
what the hell is this thing so that's
totally graphite which I guess is carbon
I don't know exactly what to say for
that what exactly is this I have notes
this is the innovation cooling graphite
thermal pad the goal of it is to replace
traditional thermal pastes in long term
applications its main advantages are
it's easy application there's no
guessing how much to put on it's
extremely long life and its high
resistance to thermal changes which make
it also good for extreme cooling
scenarios where liquid metal or normal
thermal paste might freeze so in a
nutshell what they're saying is that
this pad even though it will be so thick
compared to a paste has no real
disadvantage compared to spreading goop
on your CPU
well one disadvantage is that it is
electrically conductive so one yeah like
two ohms which is like better than a
wire but if you just toss it on your
motherboard it's gonna fry it so you do
have to be more careful
but unlike liquid metal it's not gonna
seep out yeah it's not gonna just go
everywhere you can get a pretty on there
so would you just cut it to size if you
had something that was yeah so the main
spec on this is it's thermal
conductivity 35 watts per meter Kelvin
but I think probably most people
wouldn't have a ton of context for what
that means so compared to like I see
diamond that's really high so this is
like 4 and 1/2 watts per meter Kelvin so
it should be able to conduct a lot of
heat through it but what is a watt per
meter Kelvin
you don't know exactly do you know why
do I even employ these people I'm
looking it up right now unfortunately
there are differing definitions for
these terms
okay so quantity of heat that passes in
a unit time through a plate of
particular area or thickness when
opposite phases different temperature by
one Kelvin so that means that if there's
one Kelvin difference between the two
you can conduct 35 watts per meter so it
actually makes a lot of sense when you
think of it like that
cool let's try it this is trippy man
like cleaning all of the paste off and
having it just like dry mounted like
there are things in life that feel
natural to mount dry and there are
things and there are things that don't
uh-huh so an advantage to this dry
approach is that there's no liquid like
you know most thermal compounds are some
kind of a suspension of some sort so
there's no liquid to eventually
evaporate or dry out or mush out or
anything like that it's just that's just
it you just plunk it on there this is
crazy
just for the sake of you no transparency
no thermal paste it's double screw on
the draw you finished first now I feel
awkward okay
it's trippy like it seems like it it's
not right you know we're looking at this
is a 79 80 XE with liquid metal in it
okay so we're looking at an average
temperature across all cores of 50 point
five six and that was with IC diamond
yeah so IC diamond might not be the
highest performance thermal compound but
it's very respectable they're all within
what like two degrees of each other at
the high end yeah I mean we'd had that
bulk stuff that didn't perform
particularly well that video is worth
watching can check that out here
nothing's immediately concerning no that
looks very impressive yeah what did we
get on IC diamond
max 58 average 50 point five six like it
should perform and everything that I've
read one to two degrees worse but I mean
that's part of the argument for a
solution like this that there's no room
for user error yeah like I might have
done a bad core application or a bad
mount so at the end of the day that's
the conclusion of this video alex is a
bad man we won't know for another 20
minutes or so or maybe five minutes I
don't know all right so it's been hours
an hour teen yeah yeah okay cool how do
we do plus 50 plus what's the point of
even having a fancy-ass calculator if it
doesn't get it right well it's not the
calculators fault so it's the user he
thinks barely warm which I guess makes
sense still trips me out so this one
from Alex's pre-testing has actually
been used a couple times and innovation
cooling told us that they've had people
beta testing these that have reused them
like over 20 times over 50 even right
over 50 yeah over 50 all right so our
average is 50 1.7 so exactly what we
expected okay so all that's left for me
then
is I want to I want to see like is it
thinner yeah I guess let's shut it down
all right
Oh one thing that is cool about is that
it has the 35 watts per meter Kelvin
that's in the Z direction so like up and
down but it's 800 ish 800 thousand
they're not totally sure what's premiere
Kelvin from side to side oh so that's
why it burning me when I torched it yeah
so that's really good if you have like a
hot spot on your CPU it'll get it out to
the heat pipes really well one thing I
don't like about it that much
is the size what well I mean that looks
fine for a core I 9 but if I was cooling
something like a thread ripper or what
I've been tellin scalable is or
something like that like a really big
chip I kind of feel like you could
actually have died area can you touch me
not covered I don't know it's a
wonderful question I don't know the
answer to that so I guess it should be
like that and theoretically nothing
would ever happen to it at all yeah they
said to lifetime it should be about the
same I think the coolest thing about
this for me is like you know for the
last 10 20 years you know every other
month there's like a big article about
how you know carbon nanotubes or this
other novel implementation of carbon is
going to completely revolutionize
everything and up until now at least in
the thermal space although theoretically
it has great thermal properties we
haven't really seen anything and now
here it is you can buy it you can stick
it in your computer yeah completely
commercial and it works speaking of

description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one as well as our
community for oh I'm sorry and our
community forums which you should
totally join so like theoretically
there's no reason for us to ever apply
thermal goop again we just throw these
on everything from now on and just reuse
them forever like I guess we could yeah
take that thermal paste no no it's like
we've got so much of it though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
