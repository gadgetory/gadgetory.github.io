than a specific product this is the
g.skill ripjaws series now these didn't
just launch but what's special about
this particular ram is that it is
optimized for the core i5 and they've
actually recently made some revisions so
a lot of the Ripjaws SKUs have now been
changed over to one point six volts
rather than one point six five volts now
what that means of them and I'm gonna
start opening the box here while I
explain this is that you can run them at
their rated speed at a much lower
voltage which means less heat and of
course longer term reliability now the
core i5 is actually a little bit less
resilient than the core i7 the old core
i7 on LGA 1366 to high voltages on the
memory controller so that is why g.skill
even though it's still SPECT for 1.65 on
the intel side has actually gone and
reduced the voltage even further by more
aggressively bidding their chips now in
terms of binning the ram chips g.skill
modules are actually known to reach
speeds quite a bit higher than what
they're rated for but these particular
ones are ddr3 1600 cl7 modules and
they're quite reasonably priced now
let's have a quick look at the RAM
spreader itself first of all you can see
it's got like a black white and red
theme very Canadian I really like it of
course and then on the other side you've
got your sticker do not remove warranty
void if removed and it lists your specs
there as well so this is a four gig kit
and I already mentioned the voltage and
the speeds I just want to have a quick
look down the heat spreader here so you
can see that the way they've positioned
the heat spreader is such that when you
have it actually installed in a computer
heat is able to dissipate up the tunnels
sort of here like that okay I realize
it's kind of trivial it's not gonna make
a huge difference in cooling but I've
seen some pretty stupid Ram spreaders
where the fins come out this way and
they block air from actually flowing
naturally as the heat rises off the
memory module that said it's debatable
how much of the difference a heat
spreader makes but these do look really
cool when you install them in your
system thank you for checking out my
video unboxing of the g.skill ripjaws
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
