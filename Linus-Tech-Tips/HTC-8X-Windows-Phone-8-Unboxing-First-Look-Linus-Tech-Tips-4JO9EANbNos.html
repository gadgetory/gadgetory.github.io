nothing actually no there's something
this is the Windows Phone 8x from HTC
this is a Windows Phone which basically
means that you already know a lot of
what there is to know about the device
that's inside because Microsoft locks
down the platform in a big way compared
to what other manufacturers do so on
Android you can find any configuration
Under the Sun
whereas for Windows Phone you can find I
mean ok it's better than it was with
Windows Phone 7 so you know they've
locked down certain things like what
kind of a you know processor you can use
this guy right here has 16 gigs of
storage and unfortunately does not
actually give you the option to upgrade
it with micro sd one gig of ram ok it's
got a Qualcomm s4 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core so this is the s4 plus
platform this isn't nearly as fast as
the s4 pro which is in the Droid DNA
that we also took a look at recently but
it should still be fast enough because
of the optimizations that Microsoft has
done on Windows 8 Phone to make it
extremely fluid to use so we're sort of
taking this off this is a very strange
box it's like I thought at first that it
was foam but it's actually like a
cardboard paper carton thing ah there we
go
eco-friendly packaging got it Beats
Audio is included with a glute exclusive
built-in amp 4.3 inch Super LCD 2 screen
720p so this is not Super LCD 3 which is
just a new iteration of the technology
in the Droid DNA and it is not 1080p
unlike the Droid DNA but I'm still
really excited to try this one out just
because I'm super stoked on trying out
Windows Phone what else we got here 8
megapixel camera with an F 2.0 aperture
lens autofocus LED flash ultra
wide-angle front camera so this is part
of HTC's whole image image sense sort of
platform here so they've added a lot of
that technology in here so it's got
their dedicated image chip which is
basically just fast video and photo
processing the two-pointer aperture lens
makes a big difference this is important
because the lower the aperture the more
light the lens actually
allow us to pass through it this gives
you automatically better photos compared
to if you did nothing compared to if you
had a higher aperture lens because the
technology works is you've got a sensor
on the other side that's a bigger or as
small as it is and physics dictates sort
of how much light you can hit it with
and then the lens either allows more
light through or doesn't allow as much
light through the higher quality lens
the lower the aperture it's capable of
running at so they're basically just
saying yeah we're gonna use an awesome
sensor and we're gonna throw an awesome
lens at it as well as the whole
beatsaudio branding thing so I don't
know I haven't tried it yet the whole
beatsaudio
paradigm thing that they've got going on
this phone but what I do know is that
having an amped an amped
three-and-a-half millimeter jack on it
will make a difference compared to
having a non amped one especially if you
have higher quality headphones or higher
quality IMS this is mostly relevant for
headphones though guys so dual-core
crate I yes it uses an Adreno 305 GPU
which is not the most powerful that's
available on that platform it's actually
weaker than a 225 but the 225 is sort of
a last generation souped-up one and the
audrina 305 is sort of a less powerful
current gen one there's not there's not
that many games on the windows App Store
yet but hopefully that will change and
we will need that GPU to to be capable
of more in the meantime let's have a
look at what's inside the eco-friendly
box so this is please do not misplace
this label and attached to the device to
clean service or repair got it then we
have a micro sim removal tool we have
your Windows Phone 8x quick guide
getting to know your phone front camera
touchscreen oh yes the importance of the
wide-angle front camera lens that's cool
because if you're going to be using the
phone for things like to haven't even
know what see I'm such an Apple person
see iPhone 4 right for FaceTime or Skype
okay alright okay other things then what
you can do is you can point it at you
and it'll actually so you'll get a
little bit of fisheye but it'll see a
wider a wider image so if you had a
group of people you know crowded around
it or whatever else then having a
wide-angle lens there
beneficial whereas if you didn't then it
would not be beneficial so yeah front
camera here proximity sensor here so
that could be useful notification LED is
built into the front grille here the
touchscreen is that this is awesome the
touchscreen is actually labeled on here
touch screen got it and then camera
button is dedicated camera button this
is a requirement on Windows Phone so
it's a two stage button which means
halfway for focus all the way to
actually take a picture start buttons
here with back and search dedicated
buttons down there and you've got a
micro USB for charging it should however
be noted that this phone does include
wireless charging but apparently it's
not necessarily hold on let me just see
is that this phone I have notes ok it's
wireless charging but it's like not
quite the same as other wireless
charging solutions guys you're gonna
have to leave a comment and let me know
sort of if I'm wrong about that in fact
we'll be back in a moment to put the sim
in and then yeah there's a micro USB for
charging which isn't necessarily my
favorite connector but it's not the end
of the world so we stealthily installed
a SIM card in it while we while we were
off camera there so let's get started
click get started I can tell the
difference between the Super LCD 2 and
Super LCD 3 already because I did just
have a chance to check out Super LCD 3
how do you like your Windows Phone can
enable mobile data automatically
download updates blah blah blah Wi-Fi
connection oh this is speaking of what
what's your home country United Kingdom
where the heck was this phone intended
to be sent there we go look at that they
have Canada in there send my location to
Microsoft when my phone is activated now
it should be ok
I'm sure Microsoft doesn't care a
Microsoft account allows you to do it
you know what we'll sign in later Diane
later thank you a few more apps still
need to finish installing so what else
can we say about it
um well number one is the fact that the
biggest complaint that people have
generally had about Windows Phone 8 is
the app ecosystem so there's even things
like google only has one native app for
Windows Phone 8 at this point in time so
yeah it's not as rich as something
iOS or Android but I personally believe
that that will improve over time so I'm
my intention as of sort of filming this
video right now is to stop using my
iPhone for outright and switch to using
the 8x from HTC and find out if I can
actually survive the switch in the app
ecosystem that exists so things like
maps I'm expecting to be using Nokia
Maps because Microsoft actually doesn't
include Bing Maps as the default map
application because apparently the Nokia
one is excellent
so even other handset makers have to use
Nokia Maps which I thought was sort of a
weird thing but is I guess not the end
of the world as long as your Nokia you
know what let's have a look at the phone
physically a little bit they're calling
it a human form which isn't the first
time we've heard that as a way of
describing sort of the way that a phone
is got sort of naturally flowing lines
there are no sharp edges on the phone
whatsoever so everything is very curvy
here if I actually hold it upright like
this you'll see that the edges are
rounded rounded edges hold it on this
side it's hard to figure out the angling
yep there you go so rounded edges again
even the edges of the glass are actually
rounded slightly so I really don't know
if you're gonna be able to see that but
there's no there's no sharp edge to it
it flows seamlessly into the yellow
accent speaking of the yellow the yellow
shell so I picked this particular color
it's a very bold color but there are
other colors available guys don't worry
the 8x isn't only available in peeled
the retinas off of your eyeballs green
which is definitely thankful because I
have sort of a unique taste in terms of
aesthetics and not everyone necessarily
shares it so I just want to see if I'm
missing anything else here will have to
do of course my obligatory iPhone 4 size
comparison so the phone itself is wider
than an iPhone 4 which you'll know if
you've done any research on it
whatsoever because it's significantly
larger than an iPhone 4 which most
phones are these days because Apple
seems to be falling a little bit behind
in terms of phone sizes and and staying
competitive about them people that the
trend right now seems to be larger
screen sizes thickness is pretty similar
but because of the curved
shape it actually does feel more natural
in the hand compared to the droid DNA
which I had said in my unboxing is way
too big for my hands cuz I look at that
I can barely reach across I have quite
small hands and I thought was one of the
reasons that I always found the iPhone
for quite comfortable to use I can
actually reach the top corner it looks
like because of the dead space here at
the bottom with buttons I'm not quite
gonna be able to reach the top-left
corner but it's not that bad I can do
bottom left bottom right top right and
not quite top left so hopefully I won't
have too much trouble with that UI seems
very very snappy so far and this is
actually my first time with Windows 8
other than are not without with Windows
Phone 8 other than a brief experience
with it at the NCIX tech fair not that
long ago so live tiles can be customized
in a lot of different ways to actually
give you live updates about things on
the fly it includes Internet Explorer
recommended Internet Explorer 10 which
particularly for particularly for html5
is supposed to be quite the Beast
so let's just go somewhere where people
like to go like oh yes factory-direct
oh no not what I meant to do allow no
not FA CR that's not what we want I'll
look at that speech recognition go ahead
Oh
facebook.com facebook.com ok then that
worked in spite of all the sort of stuff
that I was saying before that so that
actually won't work that well because we
want to go somewhere you know what let's
just do our usual thing let's go to the
NCIX website I wish it would take you
straight there like kind of a I'm
feeling lucky search if you key it right
into there so browsing feels pretty
smooth not quite as good as the Droid
DNA where I can see a little bit of I
can see a little bit of pop in at the
edges and then zooming yet you can see
it you can see it a little bit there but
the Droid DNA is running the pro tip set
whereas this one is running the plus
chip set which is significantly less
powerful so it's got NFC Kids Korner is
kind of a neat feature that's included
with Windows Phone 8 so it's not so much
to protect your kids from doing anything
stupid but it's - well yeah protect your
kids from doing anything stupid that
bunch of emails to everyone in your
contact list but it doesn't necessarily
protect them from finding anything
harmful on the Internet's I think that
pretty much does it I'm looking through
oh yes data sense so its carrier
dependent but it allows the data be
compressed on the carrier side so that
you don't use as much data and it also
is supposed to help you this is a
Windows Phone 8 feature find local
hotspots that are around you and connect
to them so that any background services
can be running off that whenever you're
in range of it it is an LG R an LTE 4G
phone is not an LG phone LTE 4G phone
but it is not going to be available in
my region because I have the wrong
carrier and this is the wrong phone and
all of that stuff that makes it not work
the media ecosystem is supposed to
easily integrate with the Xbox Store
compared to sort of previous zoom
branding or whatever else is going on so
if you buy something on here that's a
song the minute you sit down at another
Windows branded device or an Xbox it
should all be available through the
collec cloud there and that pretty much
wraps it up so we'll just do a little
bit more close up in terms of size
comparison I'd love for you guys to see
it up against a couple of other phones
so this is a Samsung Note 2 so you can
see that it's clearly absolutely
ridiculous in size and has a BenQ
sticker on the back which diesel thinks
is some kind of a fashion statement or
something like that then there's the
Droid DNA so you can see it's quite a
bit smaller than that and finally
there's the iPhone 4 which you've
already seen don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and I
will see you guys again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
