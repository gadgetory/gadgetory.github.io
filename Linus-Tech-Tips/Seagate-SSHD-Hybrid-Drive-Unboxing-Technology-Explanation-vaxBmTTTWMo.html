Corsair Vengeance k70 and k95 these
fully mechanical keyboards are designed
for performance gaming visit Corsair
comm slash Vengeance gaming to learn
more welcome to mind beggin of something
that I personally think is really
important and really interesting but you
might disagree but I mean come on at
this point you clicked on the video you
might as well watch it right this is the
creatively named Seagate desktop sshd
2000 gigabyte really like whoever names
their products they get an award for
being very practical so what it is is it
their first desktop hybrid drive so it
contains in spite of its normal
three-and-a-half inch form factor and
normal say two three six gigabit per
second interface a regular mechanical
three and a half inch drive so it's
available in one terabyte or two
terabyte although they're a little
birdie told me there might be a higher
capacity one later
although saying that there might be a
higher capacity hard drive later is
about like saying the Sun might rise
like they really are about the same
probability because if the Sun stopped
rising then all the hard drives would
probably go away anyway so it contains a
mechanical hard drive as well as an SSD
inside that you completely doesn't need
to be configured at all so the 8 gig SSD
and that seems pretty small but more on
that in a moment
dynamically finds the data that you use
most often and caches it in there for
much much faster reads now there's a
little bit of a writing strategy as well
but not nearly to the same extent as it
uses the SSD for reads which is really
important particularly for things like
your operating system so if you're
getting used to devices like smartphones
and tablets and even ultrabooks to a
lesser extent that runs strictly off of
flash you're probably getting used to a
level of responsiveness that just can't
be achieved through pure mechanical
that's where the SSD comes in so even
though it's quite small you're able to
cache the things that are going to make
your system feel really responsive but
you're able to have that large capacity
backup for things like large games that
you want to install or large programs
like I don't know you know Adobe suite
or things like that and it really does
give sort of the best of both worlds in
addition to performance you're also
going to potentially
make the device last longer so there's a
few different ways of looking at this
number one is you're adding more points
of failure when you have SSD as well as
mechanical number two though is that
you're making them inherently last
longer because SSDs don't like being
written to eventually they will die but
what happens is because you're not
always writing things directly to the
SSD you're actually writing to the hard
drive the SSD only gets written to when
it's something that you use very very
frequently and SSDs don't get worn out
by reading from them okay then there's a
mechanical drive that gets worn out
about equally from reading and writing
so you have to write it to it regardless
but what if you could read all of your
most frequently used data from the SSD
which doesn't really wear out see where
I'm going with this so you could
potentially get a longevity benefit as
well
now this implementation is not the
be-all and end-all of a hybrid solution
so if you have two separate drives you
can use Intel SRT to use an SSD to cache
a hard drive completely separately and
there are actually drives being
manufactured with a single interface
that have to separately addressable
drives inside them this is one of the
benefits of SATA 3/6 gigabit per second
right because you've got tons of
bandwidth there as long as you're not
talking about extremely high performance
like enthusiasts great SSDs there are
other implementations as well I mean
Microsoft's working on ways to have the
OS handle some of the SSD caching itself
and Intel Seagate and Western Digital
worked on an extension to the SATA 3 i/o
that is going to allow the drives
themselves which really do know more
about what's going on inside them than
the OS necessarily does to start
providing hints to the OS about what to
cache and when and where so the future
is extremely exciting and I believe that
as much as I use solid-state only in my
desktop machines I do use mechanical for
mass storage over the network so as much
as I believe in solid-state and love it
I do believe that a hybrid is going to
be the future at least for the near to
mid term so guys do check this out
it's the Seagate desktop sshd
the most interesting name ever and don't
