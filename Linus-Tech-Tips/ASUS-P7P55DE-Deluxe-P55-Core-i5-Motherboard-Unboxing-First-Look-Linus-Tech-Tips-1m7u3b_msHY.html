and having a quick look at the assuit P
7 P 55 D II deluxe I mean motherboard
names it's like yes these all mean
something but matter they ever like
confusing when you're trying to shop and
you don't actually know a lot about
computers okay so this is part of their
new extreme design platform number one
performance reliability and safety I'm
not quite sure exactly what that means
but anyway it's Windows 7 ready physics
ready whatever that means
it's LGA 1156 it's p 55 so you're gonna
see the usual p55 features except that
this is one of their new updated boards
and it includes USB 3.0 SATA 6 gigabits
per second as well as a 24 hybrid phase
design which according to this means
that it has 16 plus 3 faces and T probe
which I believe is some kind of like
dynamic adjuster of Denton it detects
and balances power phase loads and
temperatures real-time with optimal
power phase functions components are
cooler and extend system lifespan very
cool
ok so also on this board let's start at
the top you have how you have the
Express speed hybrid OS whatever you
have system level energy efficiency so
that controls everything about your
system to try and get better power
savings or something you have an onboard
switch which is a fairly common feature
at this point you have the Q design for
DIY quickly and easily okay you've got
quad GPU SLI and quad GPU crossfire X
support that's pretty cool
auto-tuning so they've got a software
overclocking utility and they have memo
K which allows you to take even memory
that has sort of non standardized
non-standardized settings it allows you
to at least get the board to boot with
that memory in so that you can adjust
all of the settings and get it to run
properly at the rated speed so let's get
this box open and have a look at what we
have for accessories ok the first thing
I like about this board is that it has
black SATA cables I am so sick of seeing
like yellow and red SATA cables I show
me a system with a color scheme that
yellow looks good and I challenge you to
do that ok so you've got three right
angle and three straight SATA cables
then you've got an SLI bridge
okay you've got the cute connectors part
of their cue design and those allow you
to plug in the front panel connectors
fairly easily I love this this is
awesome I talked about this on one of
the recent distance boards I have a look
at instead of including two USB and one
firewire port where I'm now seeing combo
back plates that are two USB in an eSATA
port way more useful I mean who uses
fire why are you okay then we've got
what is this okay so this is their
little overclocking remote control and
it looks to plug into must be USB
because it's color coded red white green
black black like USB but it's uh
converted USB port on the board
somewhere okay then you've got an IDE
cable then you've got an i/o shield
which isn't color-coded but they have
done a one special call-out you can see
these two USB ports are highlighted
white those are the USB 3.0 ports then
we've got the piece of a user guide as
well as the driver disk and a soos case
badge okay don't don't use this driver
disk download the latest ones as I
usually say now let's get the board
itself out of here now I realized that
the p55 boards launched not all that
long ago but we're seeing so many
updated product designs just because of
the launch of c-23 and USB 3.0 so that's
going to be coming the focus of my
unboxing but let's do a quick overview
of the overall design of this board okay
so we have two PCI Express 16x slots so
those are going to be for your crossfire
or SLI they are functional in 8 X 8 X
mode if you are using crossfire SLI like
all p55 boards because the PCI Express
Lanes
are actually powered by the CPU and not
by the chipset okay down at the bottom
here we've got our onboard power and
reset switches and oh there's a plx chip
for some reason although I couldn't tell
you what that is for oh I wish I knew
why that was there because normally a
plx chip is like a PCI Express bridge
chip and it's usually there to like
split PCI Express liens or something
no no they both wanted a tax okay so I
wasn't wrong there all right so let's
keep moving right along then we've got
three USB 2.0 headers then we have okay
so these two white ones here are the
SATA 6 gigabits
per second ports okay this one is SATA
underscore EU one and I don't know what
the relevance of that is maybe it's
running off the same chipset as the
other eSATA back here I'm kind of
guessing there and since all of the
chips are covered under this kind of
neat looking heatsink
I can't really tell what they are then
on the side of the board we've got six
SATA 2 ports so these are all running
off the Intel chipset we've got an IDE
port you will notice the conspicuous
absence of a floppy port I'm sure most
people won't miss that like all p55
boards we've got support for dual
channel ddr3 memory you can see that
they're using their trademark design
here on the memory slots only one end of
the memory slots actually has a clip so
what you're supposed to do is peel these
back slide the memory slot in from the
top into this side and then just clip it
in from the one side so it makes memory
installation in theory much easier ok
we've also got our memo ok button over
here so that is to make sure that the
board can post with whatever memory you
happen to be using and then up here
we've got little switches to over volt
the CPU that integrated memory
controller or the round it's kind of
nice to have those Hardware switches for
the really hardcore guys who are using
this on an open test bench anyway ok so
moving right along we've got our power
connector at its ideal place along the
right-hand edge of the board and then
we've got an 8 pin power connector up at
the top sort of left of the board a lot
of a lot of cases these days have a hole
for it right over here so it's a little
bit of a reach but overall I like this
position here is our 24 phase hybrid
design which apparently means 16 phases
for the CPU itself and then I believe 3
phases for the integrated memory
controller something that I really like
about this board right off the bat is it
has so many 4 pin fan connectors we've
got a couple here and most boards
usually just give you one for the CPU
and no other ones but it's kind of nice
to see that as soos is using they're now
trademarked because so many of their
recent boards are using it this kind of
like ice castle looking MOSFET cooler
design I really like that I think it
looks really stylish do what am I
missing here ok well here's the Poe here
here's the plug for that for that
overclocking remote
control things so I can't imagine the
practicality of that but I guess you
plug it in here if you're on an open
test bench and you can kind of run it
off the top of the board that way here's
the CPU socket it's an LGA 1156 socket
supports core i5 core i7 okay oh I like
this actually it's so rare you see the
board manufacturers not cheap out and
use like proper back plates on their
MOSFET coolers because this really gives
a lot more rigidity to the board I mean
a PCB has a lot of flex in it so when
you put these kind of mounting plates on
the back it allows you to make much
better contact with the mosfet coolers
on the top so you can ensure that
everything gets cooled adequately so I
really like to see that as well
okay then let's get around to the back
of the board here we've got two ps2
ports I don't think these are ever gonna
go away to be honest we have a clear
CMOS switch here's our two USB 3.0 ports
then we have two digital audio ports
we've got six USB 2.0 ports a firewire
and eSATA two Gigabit Ethernet ports as
well as 7.1 audio and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the p7p 55
