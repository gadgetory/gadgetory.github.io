powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM time for our look at MSI components
so right here
we've got something bad ok it's a little
bit different from what we saw before
and that it's completely different from
what we saw before the first time we saw
OC certified from MSI was with their z77
mPower board and what OC certified meant
was they were going to use enthusiast
grade overclocking tools and stability
testing tools such as prime95 and do an
actual burnin on actually every single
board before it ships meaning at an
overclock setting meaning that pretty
much no matter what unless something
disastrous happens in transit that
motherboard will overclock regardless
now that concept has been expanded
incredibly since last generation so now
not only is there an empower motherboard
now we've got an empower Maxx as well as
an X power motherboard that are both
undergoing the same OSI certified
routine so they have to run they have to
overclock and they have to be able to
survive at extremely high temperatures
now that's been expanded to motherboards
video cards and even partner products
such as this of X here Ram so let's move
over to our right here you can have a
look right here reference boards what do
they typically get tested at maybe a few
hours of burnin MSI is testing for 24
hours on every single board now
obviously overclocking is never
guaranteed but certainly if you use
their easy tools such as OC Genie which
is you're going to find on the X power
right here which also has all the usual
onboard switches in addition to some
other cool onboard switches you've got
uh-huh Wow
you've got 10 SATA 3/6 gigabit per
second poor it's a couple USB three
front panel ports you've got dip
switches that looks like you can
actually enable and disable separate PCI
Express slots you've got a ton of
lighting effects so these X's on the on
the vrm cooling solution up here
actually are illuminated in addition to
the MSI logo down here on the chipset
cooler the MSI logo here on the bottom
the board and their audio booth solution
which has a yellow line all the way down
for the separate PCB so audio boost is a
concept that we're seeing on quite a few
of the boards including their o ce
certified boards as well as their gaming
boards that allows them to drive up to
600 ohm headphones and they're using
much higher quality more audio tuned
components in order to deliver better
performance now I've been an advocate of
better onboard sound on motherboards for
a long time I haven't personally tried
audio boost yet but I'm extremely
excited to give it a crack we've also
got some video cards so there's there's
gtx 770 lightning which i haven't had a
chance to check out yet but if it's
anything like their previous lightning
addition cards i'm expecting it to be
pretty much awesome they're 7970
lightning is here and they have a gtx
780 lightning which they are refusing to
show to anybody is a completely new
completely different design and there's
not much for me to say about it other
than the fact that i can't look at it
and neither can you
okay so that was overclocking optimized
boards now we're gonna have a look at
some gaming optimized board what's makes
it what makes a motherboard Gaming
optimized I mean whoa Kay we've seen
color scheme we've seen overclocking
optimizations which obviously help with
gaming as well because more performance
is never ever ever a bad thing but
that's not really what it's all about
MSI actually launched and this was a
very strange product launch to me there
z77 gaming series boards very close to
the end of the z77 platform being the
flagship platform but I guess what they
were trying to do is test it out and
find out if this was a concept that
really resonated and they did a few
things differently so number one is they
added killer Niki 2200 networking which
allows you to have Network
prioritization that's built directly
into your board I mean I was never a
huge advocate of the killer Nick but the
problem was that the thing cost over
$100 I mean it performed better than on
board Nick solutions at the time but it
was unbelievably expensive for what you
were getting
well now it's built into your
motherboard I mean we're talking about a
10 $15 adder for a gaming edition board
from MSI versus a regular board so you
get the killer Nick now you get it for
15 bucks ok now that's a more compelling
value add you're also getting their new
audio boost solution
which means that they're improving the
onboard audio solution I personally find
that in addition to visuals great audio
is a huge part of the gaming experience
and doesn't really get enough attention
we also see a whole bunch of other stuff
that we've seen before from MSI so
they've got their OC Genie one-button
overclocking because quite frankly the
line between gamers and hardware
enthusiasts is more pronounced than you
think many people just want to focus on
the game they don't want to focus
necessarily on you know tuning the base
clock and increasing the multiplier but
if you do want to do that we have an
overclocking guide for the Haswell
platform just throwing that out there
but if you don't want to do that you
press a button you overclock it no big
deal they've also got their military
class concept continuing with a
fourth-generation and that has earned
them some interesting recognition so
they won the context Taipei BC golden
Award for this particular motherboard
they were the only motherboard to win
this award and there's a couple of
reasons why so number one is the
features number two is the quality that
they are going for with this particular
product so I don't know if you're gonna
be able to see this that well but it's
the first motherboard that they've
actually had I don't remember how to
pronounce that but whatever it's certify
it's a German certification where
basically they figured this board based
on the quality of the components is
probably good for about a twenty five
year lifetime which I can pretty much
tell you with the pace that technology
moves that you're not gonna want to be
using it in 25 years so your
motherboards gonna last longer than you
could possibly want it to it's gonna be
like that car that like it's got like
300,000 kilometers on it you just you
don't want it to run anymore but it just
does and I mean I that's good right so
there you have it we've also got some
more components of the ecosystem so in
addition to the gaming braid
motherboards they're doing gaming themed
video cards so these some kinds of cards
such as a GTX 780 gaming 770 gaming and
650 ti boost gaming are going to
continue these concepts such as military
class components all that cool stuff in
addition to actually matching the boards
making so you can have a more
color-coordinated build overall thank
