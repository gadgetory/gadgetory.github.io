a NFP 12 right with us today so we're
going to have a look at this fan but
first let's take a look at their
packaging basically Noctua markets this
fan as the ultimate silent high-pressure
solution so they're saying that because
of the way they've designed the blades
they are able to better push air through
something like a high density a -
density heatsink or a water cooling
radiator all the while maintaining the
silence that nacht was known for now
nacht was color scheme leaves a little
bit to be desired but let's have a look
at the accessory package so you've got
two different low voltage adapters one
of these will take your fan down to 5
volts and the other one will take it
down to 7 volts and knock to a fans are
designed to be under bolted very
comfortably then we have a molex to 3
pin adapter then you've got 2 different
options for mounting the fan you've got
either four fan screws or you've got
these four rubber grommets you can get
them out of the package then you can use
them to poke through the corners of the
fan and I'll just kind of demonstrate
how this works so you'd poke it through
the corners of the fan and then pull it
through your case so that it can
actually oh no not quite like that I'm
terribly sorry
you would actually poke it through the
other way through the case into the fan
and then attach it to the fan like this
so your case sits in between this gap
right there so that's a pretty cool way
of mounting it so just giving a better
view of how the blades work you can see
actually and this is this is kind of
cool they advertise this on the package
how every third every three blades has a
different pattern to the notches that's
apparently to reduce the the turbulence
from the fan spinning so that's kind of
a neat effect when it spins anyway thank
you for checking out the naktu @nf p12
