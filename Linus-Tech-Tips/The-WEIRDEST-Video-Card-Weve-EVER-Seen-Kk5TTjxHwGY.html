graphics card lately the outputs are all
pretty much the same you got your
DisplayPort you got your HDMI in some
cases you'll still find a DVI kicking
around and then nvidia in particular has
this little VR link connector a USB
type-c that they use for VR which is
kind of cool AMD
much of the same no DVI no VR link no
big deal well that's boring
what if there was something totally
different this is a graphics card from a
company I had never heard before called
bully and the Advani ta6 is a video card
unlike any gotcha PCI Express 16 X it's
got your power connector it's got your
bow
six ethernet jacks
madrenas coffee blend specialty cold
brew coffee Zin - 15 ounce grab go cans
for your convenience check them out and
use offer code lightness to save 40% at
the link below so this thing can support
six displays running at 4k 30 Hertz at
the same time how the bloody hell are
they doing this
anthe you did the prep for this sure did
hits Anthony Foxx so this is a weird
freaking card like this entire portion
of the PCB seems to be dedicated to
these HD based he certified outputs and
we'll get into that a little bit more
detail later back here we've got a
couple of three-and-a-half millimeter
jacks what are these four those are four
infrared pass-through so you can have
infrared in and infrared out as well as
our two rs-232 serial oh interesting so
you can use a remote and have it it's
actually got IR blasters here cool all
right now the graphics card itself is
actually not here or at least it's not
integrated onto this output board so MXM
is a laptop graphics card form factor
that's typically used in like gaming
notebooks but then they've gone and
they've put this Radeon card in it but
isn't something I'd ever even heard
before like I assumed this was gonna be
an rx something or other but instead it
said what was it again it's actually an
brady unintegrated
embedded 9550 so this has so far raised
more questions than it has answered my
understanding is this is running off of
it right now is that right oh yeah
that's absolutely these do you want to
show me how this cable run works so it's
just a single Ethernet cable that comes
from the card from there we're going
HDMI straight into this monitor okay and
then should I be able to tell any
difference from using this at all not
really so than Anthony how much of a
delay is there if I just pop this
ethernet cable out and then
like pop it back in to about two and a
half seconds so it's about the same as
what HT mine would be so that's six pin
adapter that goes in is taking care of
power not just for the GPU but also for
the power that has to be sent to these
adapters that take that HD base T signal
and turn it into something that a
display can understand now you can do 10
Gigabit Ethernet networking at up to a
hundred meters if you've got high enough
quality cabling and HD base T can
actually do the same thing so at voley
sent us over 600 meters of what has to
be the most badass what is this like cat
7 like shielded cat 7 or something yeah
pretty sure that's cat 7 I mean look at
these connectors on the end is real this
is solid core cabling nice and I guess
it's armored in case some idiot drops
the spool on top of it it's actually
kind of funny when you look at the
manual it says read the full
installation guide before beginning it
can be found at at voley comm / ta 6
performance why you will make mistakes
and you need to read the warnings in
situ related items that's literally
what's written here so the first thing I
need to do is plug all of these into the
back of the GPU correct
I mean sure if you want to oh ok so then
now the plan is for me to drag I don't
know
80 pounds of copper like as far as you
can go and then we can plug in a monitor
and see what it looks like I won't be
able to see it from there though because
I needed that put here don't mind me I'm
just you know plugging in my monitor
gentleman no I'm good
outside you know when we said this
channel is about to get heavy this is
exactly what we had in mind
lots and lots of copper no I got this
I'm close I can smell it
all right so there's two power leads
outside yeah and we should have five
here and do we have a remote for this oh
man it's getting dark this is really
annoying all we had to do was not take
that roundabout route through the
editing den and we'd be inside right now
doing this hey at least we cleverly
planned ahead and we're going to use the
the quad input monitor from LG that
thing has come in handy for so many
projects like this we're like we need to
output to a bunch of displays but we
don't actually want to carry a bunch of
monitors all right let's start with two
so this is the one that should be
mirroring the output from Anthony's
computer inside okay I'm gonna go check
again
okay Anthony I got it out put on all
them no I only have one plugged in so
far but it's the cloned one okay cool
it's not bad at all do you mind turning
the volume down a bit I can't hear
myself over myself if this looks really
good
dang alright let's go get the other
display here we go
and there it is
that's crazy town
hey Anthony is it possible to put videos
on all of them yeah okay keep going keep
going keep going keep going keep going
keep going
okay now maximize the first one you want
to come check it out
you read my mind that's actually pretty
cool yeah this looks really good yeah
and it's over 100 meters like that's
actually 100 meters plus like six or ten
feet for each of these cables and
they've apparently got some improvements
in the pipeline so right now these are
using what was it they call it power
over cable power over cable but P OE is
more of the like industry standard that
would allow better interoperability with
other equipment and they're gonna have a
p OE version of it coming down the line
so in terms of how this works then
basically unlike most of the consumer
grade in-home streaming solutions where
you can do display over Ethernet that
we've explored in the past this is using
a 10 gig link rather than a 1 gigabit
link and the thing is that even with
steam in-home streaming you can
absolutely run it over a 10 gigabit
switch with a 10 gigabit network card
but because of the way that it is
designed it will not make use of all
that extra bandwidth you have available
so this is what was it you said Anthony
eight point something like that
depending on the exact resolution 4k 30
or four K 60 at four to zero even though
you don't have as much bandwidth as HDMI
as long as you limit some of your
settings be it resolute
should be it refresh rate or be it bit
depth you can get something that to my
eye is not noticeably compressed over an
Ethernet cable pretty freakin sick what
can I say about the 1 plus 60 oxygen OS
is awesome it's got an under screen
fingerprint reader which is super
responsive it's got a Snapdragon 8045
processor and up to 8 gigs of ram with
rear 16 plus 20 megapixel dual cameras
storage starts at 128 gigs for the base
model and it's 3,700 milliamp hour
battery gives you up to a day and a half
of full use with built in fast charge
and the best part about it is you can
win one of two in our giveaway at the
