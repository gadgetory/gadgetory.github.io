the plextor m5 pro this is their new
flagship SSD Drive and let's let's start
with it sort of an overview of the
packaging so this is cool seven
millimeter height for ultra slim
notebook so they have improved the
compatibility of their Drive by reducing
the height of it which I we're starting
to see it's a bit of a trend with SSD
manufacturers this is good because
ultrabooks are not going away and we're
going to continue to need slimmer and
smaller storage devices that maintain
the performance standards that
enthusiasts demand speaking of
maintaining performance standards if
this features their exclusive firmware
with their true speed technology true
speed technology sounds like the kind of
thing that you would find on like you
know a motherboard box where it's like
maintain more performance and more
better over time and the reality of it
is true speed is not is not snake-oil
true speed is real true speed is Black
Stars way of saying that their firmware
through exclusive algorithms and through
the talent of their engineering team
plextor firmware is able to better
maintain the like new speed of the drive
over time compared to their competitors
it has been tested it has been validated
by third-party sources and it's very
very impressive so plextor is sort of
like here how do we how do we compare
them they're sort of like Intel in that
they are the company that is doing the
firmware they're doing the validation of
their drive there doing the manufacture
their drive but they're not actually the
designer and manufacturer of the
hardware chip controller that goes on it
so plextor m5 pro is actually using a
brand new controller here we'll start
opening up here this is Marvel's newest
latest controller so you know marvel
controllers from high performance drives
in the past such as Plex razon drives or
crucial drives however plextor is the
first one with the 88 5591 87 controller
and I know that's not a sexy name but
what Marvel seems to well seems to be
love doing is delivering wicked
controllers and what we know that
plextor is capable of doing is
delivering wicked firmwares so I'm very
excited to see how this Drive performs
once we actually get it fired up its
using toggle man which again if the
fastest most premium man which stands to
reason because this is not a cheap and
expensive drive it's got 512 megs of
cash that is ddr3 1333 cash which is one
of the fastest cash is out there so it
is well its state-of-the-art this new
controller from Marvel is actually
technically say to 3.1 so even though
that looks like a standard say to say to
Tuesday 23 data and power connector it
actually supports a couple of new things
including most importantly the ability
to prioritize trim commands so it not
only supports trim but it can wait to do
trim in order to finish some outstanding
iOS and then execute the trim command in
order to improve efficiency as long as
you have a compatible controller on the
other side of the of the data connection
so this drive I can tell you guys right
now is pretty much at the top in terms
of the sequential read and write
performance however there's a lot more
to it necessarily than that when it
comes to drive performance you can see
what's their spec so they're saying up
to 540 MiG's per second reads and up to
450 Meg's per second right so those
reeds are the fastest out there and the
rights leg just a little bit behind the
vertex 4 random read and random right I
ops again are pretty much class-leading
so I'm expecting very very good
performance from this drive their mean
time between failure is 2,400,000 hours
so remember guys mean time between
failures is an industry standard method
to determine what the average time for
failure for I think they have to use
something like however many hundreds of
drives at a time they run them all
through a standardized test and see how
many of them fail and after how long to
determine how long it would take for the
drugs to fail on average let's just get
and see if they have anything else to
say for themselves besides that so
enterprise standard high temperature
burnin process Plex transformers tor
technology maintains SSD performance all
right so you can restore it to a like
new state using their tools very very
easily I did forget to
in that low power consumption disk
cloning and backup utility included me
okay so yeah let's have a look at what's
included in the box so we've got a two
and a half inch to three and a half inch
adapter all the mounting screws you need
although if you're installing it in a
notebook which you can because it's slim
it'll you'll it will probably come with
the mounting adapters that you need a
ziplock baggie includes no need Oh neat
look at that comes with that system
performance analyzer I mean I guess
they're not shy about their performance
because they're they're plextor I mean I
had a meeting with them they're like
yeah yeah we we're pretty much the best
when it comes to quality and performance
I actually didn't even know this at the
time but they're one of the top
manufacturers in the world so a lot of
the drives you buy with other brand
names on them may actually be
manufactured by plextor so bear that in
mind I include the software echo back up
now easy and bonus trials ninja software
trial shadow software trial media maker
software trial okay interesting quick
installation guide limited warranty this
is a five-year warranty product so they
are standing behind it sorry I did
forget to mention that on the front so
that is right up there with competing
products like the intel 520 series and
the ocz vertex 4 so there you have it
that's the unboxing of the plextor m5 p
this is the true successor to the m3 p
using a last generation controller and
this is a very exciting time for SSD
