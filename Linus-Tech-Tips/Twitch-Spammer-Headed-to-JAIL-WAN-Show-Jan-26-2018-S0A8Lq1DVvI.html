yes ready okay we're live oh man I'm
gonna do the worst scariest thing in the
world but is the audio okay why would
you do that okay
I mean strawpoll I am gonna do the worst
scariest thing ever and I'm gonna
promote a a fan created oh no a fan
created thing here I'm posting this in
the chat my friends trying to a window
it automatically generates on a bingo
card no no you shouldn't be looking at
it because I've only seen a couple of
them myself okay basically it's kind of
like a like it's like a drinking game
like a take a shot every time Luke
laughs too loud or Linus apologizes for
being late I'm sorry we're late by the
way
except it's bingo you don't win anything
other than satisfaction and thank you we
should okay fun game it's a fun game to
play you go to win show bingo calm for
all I know by the time people are
watching the archive of this stream a
little of it'll have been converted to a
phishing scam so we don't do it right
yeah but anyway for right now this
moment it automatically like pseudo
randomly generates a bingo card out of a
bunch of possible things that can happen
during the land show and you get to fill
it out while you watch so we should in
my opinion gamify watching the wine show
even more than that so even more than
that you can get BOTS in the chat so you
should drink every time you hit one one
one cell and then you should have to
drink like I don't know buddy what do
you have to do when you when you
actually get get a row life's like skull
something yeah yeah yeah totally okay
okay what else do you want to get I was
thinking if we if we bring a bot in that
manages the chat and you can post like
you should whoever made this bingo thing
should make you unique identify our keys
for every single person that's playing
so when the bingo game is done you just
post your key in chat and it takes your
score from that website and actually
like attaches it to your username on the
LDT like lan show chat you should be
able to gain scores and then every once
a while you should be able to be like
exclamation mark brag and it'll say what
your overall score is why are people
subscribing we've had a twitch
subscriber two-two three-three twitch
Prime subscribers and a paid subscriber
since we started there no no that's the
one I was talking about okay
oh okay apparently Brendon Potts has
been subscribed for 17 months in a row
17 months 499 times 17 actually this is
not difficult math eighty five dollars
you're basically a hero more twitch
prime you only get half of that
you only get well no I know but that
doesn't that doesn't make what the heck
15 months in a row for secure is this
just all coming up now because like we
never dream basically yeah so because
your live and now people will do their
renewals because they get to post see
how that's a gray yeah yeah yeah all
your base are belong to us so he was
able to send that message along with his
subscriber renewal so that it showed up
gray along with everything you know I
appreciate the old memes it makes me
feel less old you know anytime I see in
all your days yeah or like you know
ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
you know any of that kind of stuff I
kind of go you know what this is great
this is great I feel young right now in
this moment and then I'm like oh my knee
doesn't last very long yeah we got a
great show for you guys today a lot of
great topics actually there's some
pretty crap topics yeah I will talk a
little bit about meltdown inspector
maybe Luke could talk a little bit about
how they've affected floatplane
development it's particularly sucked for
us for like reasons that aren't
immediately apparent but yep um with all
that said we also have in our news Intel
hits a 17-year high on their sales
Outlook great another another new record
the biggest crypto hack ever
so the the Krypto lovers will be like no
and the Krypto haters will be like yeah
and we'll probably be somewhere in
between yeah and then wow this new
google app lets anyone publish a local
news story that sounds like it sounds
like won't be terrible at all every
single thing posted there will be
triple-a level content not what happened
thank news it sounds like Facebook oh my
god it sort of does alright let's go the
intro oh my god you can read hyperlocal
stories about your community right from
your phone just like the local paper
that we all throw away the second it
lands on our clothes that because we
don't care do people actually care you
know what I shouldn't say that people do
actually care about local news like it
was cool it was cool getting in the
newspaper like John really cares about
like where people are from and like what
they're doing now or whatever like he
he's like really into like who else is a
you know Duke alumnus or like from it
down whatever like alumni affiliation
kind of thing is much stronger in the
states though yeah I don't think people
care nearly as much up here you and I
think that's a geographical difference
to a certain degree you would I also
never graduated fair I was close I went
through like most of the process we got
a straw poll this straw poll da m√£e
local news local man and like okay I
went to a football game at the U of a
University of Arizona and I went to a
what was it a basketball game or
something at UVic when I went to school
there yeah and like I'm talking like
Arizona school versus school and BC yeah
and the the difference was astronomical
the the like like the end like the
atmosphere I was into it when we were in
Arizona wasn't even my school and I was
like this is sick there was people like
giving
free beer couldn't drink it pop and like
burgers and hotdogs in the parking like
party I basically don't even necessarily
party just like come on join the family
kind of situation so like barbecue yeah
it was barbecue family barbecue just in
the parking lot so when we're walking
from our car to the stadium they're like
hey do you want some stuff so my
understanding is that some Canadian
sports are kind of like that like the
Grey Cup is supposed to be super Taylor
yeah yeah it's not like that's one day a
year yeah and this was a no random
college game you know CFL game is like
that yeah what it wasn't a championship
game it was just whatever there was like
a big parade with the music people I
don't know what you call them again band
no marching marching band the marching
you're so fired
I'm so fired here and like the game was
amazing anytime anyone scored if it was
the other team Oh everyone is all upset
if it was their team the entire
basketball it happens a lot yeah like
that's my problem that's football
that was football that was the one in
America was football the one in Canada
was I don't even remember cuz it didn't
matter I see Stephen volleyball no
offense volleyball lots of fun to play
not much of a spectator sport about half
the arena was empty like there was some
like sponsor stuff and then I think we
left like three-quarters way through cuz
we were just bored it was just like so
different and I could understand how it
fosters like school mentality if it's
mr. Nix mr. nix 1001 hell we tailgate
for any reason yeah okay it's a thing
fair enough and it's cool though it
makes you feel a part of it and then you
you you you feel a part of it the second
you show up because of the tailgating
okay I didn't say beach volleyball
volleyball they are not the same sport
at all they literally don't even have
the same number of people don't take
okay
they don't take place in the same place
yeah they don't have the same number of
people on the team and one of them gets
watched once every four years there you
go that
between volleyball and beach volleyball
yeah and to be clear I'm not hating like
I love anything with a net someone said
what's with the tailgating is an excuse
to drink in public okay yeah I guess so
cuz in a lot of parts of the states
that's very all right I'm gonna start
banning people who post the holy crap
Jen oh you need to stop you need to calm
down there we go
guy posted the same message like a
bajillion times anyways what were we
asking I don't know something but
anyways yeah I understand how it
facilitates the like I care about this
community environment right because
immediately when you show up you're
taking care of in a certain degree
you're you're fed right you're taking
care of you're invited in just like
insanity to me because like I can't
imagine a situation where I would go
anywhere and I would be fed by someone
for no reason
yeah what you like seems pretty cool
like it is pretty cool yeah and it was
good stuff like it 8 News yeah I don't
know so local news um someone gave me a
poster because I didn't have any like
shirt or anything to hold so they were
like here's a poster of the team so I
could hold up a thing right it was cool
I had in my room for a long time
anyways 53% of you guessed local news
and 47% of you know local news so we
seem to be split right about down the
middle people who care or don't care
about local news mind you I mean okay if
Google can capture 53% of the general
population using this service then it's
clear to me that there's your phone was
trying to listen to you gonna be lesser
gonna be lesser lesser quality local
news than ever before your phones like
what was that you want this happen no I
guess we might as well jump into that as
our first topic since we've kind of been
talking about it for a while oh there
you go bulletin yeah Google is what it's
called so it's like a bulletin board
except it's an app for contributing
hyperlocal stories about your community
for your community right from your phone
you can put a spotlight on inspiring
stories that aren't being told so
basically News is dead and this is the
replacement I mean this is
democratization of news I mean this is
something we did a piece a little while
back it was not a very successful piece
where I made like a streaming backpack
yeah and I was like this is the future
of news people just being somewhere and
streaming and like this is like what I
would consider to be you were I think I
think the reason why that didn't work
that well was you were slightly too
ahead of the curve maybe
well yeah but now and things have gotten
better to be able to make the setup
better yeah but now IRL streaming with
backpacks is like a thing and it wasn't
really when you made it well whatever I
was trying um thought it was a cool idea
so I was like okay but a step above you
know just having a phone out or whatever
would be building yourself like a
transmission processing backpack so that
you can so you can transcode to multiple
destinations so that you have multiple
SIM cards yeah a nice high high
resolution and better audio quality
camera so that the feet isn't potato
level we're going back and this is just
sort of it's it's just another branch
down that same path where ultimately
local news stations are dying this is
not debatable it's not you know it's
tappable
I don't think this place is I'm just I'm
just reading there's one line here
people everywhere want to know what is
going on in their backyard at a very
local level ranging from local bookstore
readings to high school sporting events
to information about local street
closures if this is curated well enough
and sorted well enough because there is
so many things that I will not care
about yeah but also on like a Friday I
might be like man what is there to do
right now what am I gonna do this
weekend so and if I can do like events
near me I've been blown away by the
number of things that go on in the
community of Surrey yeah so that for
example I was dropping my son off for a
preschool one morning and I just saw
like a sign in the foyer that was like
hey we're doing a we're doing a starry
night
movie night Fang that's free there's
face painting there's I forget what else
there was but there was like some
activities to do for kids and then at
dusk they were gonna bring out the big
blowup
you know portable projector screen thing
and then they just had like it looked
like one of the staff just like brought
their projector from home and it was
fine like it was cool was fun dad
speakers which is good that's plus and
they played sing I'm sure they didn't
have a license for it but you know yeah
whatever cuz it's just a janky stupid
local event that nobody even knows about
anyway but that was that was the issue
nobody knew about it so it was actually
reasonably well attended given how
difficult it was to find out about it
but then I started looking into and
there's like tons of stuff like that it
would be cool lots to do if read aloud
because like Zane I I can't pronounce
his last name but Zane from daily hive
Vancouver is a good curator of local
stuff right okay but like a lot of
people don't even know that yeah I would
have no way of knowing that yeah yeah so
like if he can post his awesome articles
that go to daily hive and he manages
people stuff into I believe a little bit
we were kind of hating on it yeah and
now I'm down okay okay if it's done
properly okay and like one thing that I
would like to is if these are able to be
sourced and if the source can make money
okay so it doesn't look like there's a
monetization strategy but this is
interesting Google is planning to work
with local news organizations to help
them find and potentially publish some
of the stories as long as they give
credit to the original authors so
they've already got a strategy to to
sort of propagate awareness of the
bulletin app through the medium and it
is ultimately going to replace that's
isn't that awful
I mean it's like you know it was gonna
happen anyway it's just like can you
imagine can you imagine this like Google
walking in and pitching this to a local
news organization so you know this I
don't think so I don't think it works
that way it just says giving credit to
their authors not the platform yeah but
yeah yeah let's see okay let's see yeah
cuz I can picture this Google
walking in and going yeah so this is
great you guys you know realistically
you can't lay off any more staff because
there's like four people here but you
know so you're not saving any money but
you're like able to get more done with
the money you already saved because you
have no money we'll just we'll get all
the local news stories for you and then
you can just sit and talk about them
we're gonna be like we're gonna be like
local reddit except there already is
local reddit so you know what we're like
curated well please wait created okay
it's read it the local reddit for around
here is terrible yeah okay our Vancouver
that's really bad that's fair okay so
there you go the app is in a limited
pilot in just two cities seemingly
arbitrary Nashville and Oakland they're
apparently both Google Fiber cities so I
was just gonna say that's not that
random because of Google Fiber and it
also says they have high poverty rates
and lie beyond the focus of the big
media hubs so it's cool okay
so cool neat all right all right so so
Google bulletin we're down now really
depends on how they do it okay I think
there is absolutely the potential for me
to be down and have it installed in my
phone and use it quite often there's
also the potential for it to be a giant
steaming heap of garbage okay I did
never ever use it cool it's free its
lightweight for telling a story by
capturing photos and is it that's it Wow
okay impactful
I don't know how James wrote so many
notes on that good job maybe you should
write for bulletin no one will pay you
but all right so this is from the
original sources from newsroom dot
intel.com root cause of the reboot issue
identified they have updated guidance
for customers and partners so the saga
continues with the whole meltdown
Spectre thing so over the weekend they
began rolling out an early version of an
updated solution to the reboot issues
that they reported on January 11th just
so you know what what is that oh is that
the quick rollout yeah interesting
good job AJ yeah good job AJ sorry
keep going um something something reboot
issues early version make a final
release available once testing is being
completed but basically apologize for
the disruption this changing guidance
may cause the security of our product is
critical I didn't tell etcetera etcetera
okay let's get to our notes here Oh so
as of January 11th Intel was notified
that the first patch they issued for
meltdown inspector vulnerabilities was
causing random reboot issues it was
later learned that the bug was affecting
has well and Broadwell platforms and on
January 22nd they made a blog post
advising that OEMs cloud service
providers system manufacturer software
vendors and end-users stopped the
deployment of current versions of the
patches as they may introduce higher
than higher than expected
reboots and other unpredictable system
behavior so let's jump into our so this
was posted originally by Evan err on the
forum and our next one is from vegetable
stew and the original articles from PC
world this is just another update on
meltdown inspector let's go ahead and
pull this up actually I remembered
there's no point in me going over my
stuff because we covered it on the first
show that we covered so Intel's plan to
fix meltdown in silicon apparently
raises more questions than it answers so
Intel has said that they plan to deploy
a hardware fix so these will be silicon
based changes to future products then
directly address the Spector and
meltdown threads threats those products
will begin appearing later this year
Intel's chief executive Brian krzanich
told investors hmm I've assigned some of
the very best minds at Intel my best
people are on it the best are the best
people you know what just because I
didn't watch that particular episode of
The Wine Show can you give me the TLDR
of how oh okay so I'm affected
floatplane I'm gonna forget part of it
which is the technicality of exactly why
this happens this way but we use a piece
of software for the virtual machines and
we use a version of it that's free and
there's a version of it that's paid I
don't remember exactly the reason why we
use
the other one I covered it properly last
time AJ's gonna skin me alive I believe
that the reason why we had to use the
paid one now is that's the only one that
got the update to manage this stuff I
don't remember why we were able to use
the free one before though yeah I think
the free ones just older versions so if
we want it to not be super owned by
meltdown well yeah I believe it's
meltdown specifically I could be wrong
though I forget which one is which then
we needed to upgrade that upgrade would
have been at the cost of $900 per CPU
like per physical CPU her physical CPU
so that's kind of a little bit of a
unique situation because most people are
like oh no our things are vulnerable now
we have to patch oh no we patched
performance went way down we saw that
with fortnight the game actually if you
want to look at a really really cool
rundown of how this has how this could
potentially affect an organization check
out for tonight's breakdown of how it
impacted their servers it was actually
really really good graphs and write up
some stuff that they did but yeah our
biggest issue was like hey we want to
not be vulnerable so super expensive
amounts of money now through a lot of
brain Kijiji ring and planning and all
this other kind of stuff I do not want
to update now we have a plan and
everything's fine and whatnot but like
pill Perry says should have just used
AMD okay you should breathe more there's
a winch oh I believe I believe it was
was it just before CES you should read
more ouch okay aside from just reading
more what AMD servers the that's part of
the read more that I'm talking about it
like we looked into this we were like
hey let's just do that no not a thing
what AMD servers yeah we're not building
our own servers just case anyone - how
many epics do you really think they've
shipped
most like just saying so we use OVH for
floatplane people are like epic which by
the way wasn't released when we began
building out floatplanes infrastructure
yeah one for that one up hand building
every server that we use for flow plane
we're essentially renting servers off
the OVH which is what most people do
that are using dedicated staff if
they're not using the etiquette or
public cloud but if they are using
public cloud type situations you don't
get the choice anyways yeah you use
whatever validated setup which by the
way someone like OVH is gonna have
Hardware on the hand whether it's hard
drives SSDs sometimes motherboards
sometimes are really slow it no no that
they're gonna have hard for upcoming for
upcoming platforms we're talking three
six nine months in advance if you're an
important partner that's buying
literally thousands upon thousands of
Xeon CPUs they make sure that you've got
this stuff for validation well ahead of
time so to imagine for a second that
epoch which launched what August in
August they announced it I think some
like that whatever sometime in the
summer to imagine that that's that's
anywhere near a for rental server it's
joke I've wanted a server with one of
those for awhile this isn't like a mu
they're really using in tooling it's
basically the only option yeah because
they typically only have like here's our
good better best extreme they're just
gonna have a handful of validated builds
and that's it and there are some more
options sometimes but we need fairly
specific things yeah there are
exceptions like we had a data center
before that would allow us to ship our
own Hardware there yeah except they were
just except they were terrible yeah like
there's a cool feature did we ever get
that server no oh they were supposed to
ship it back to us
those bastards it had a bunch of
enterprise transitive
than those enterprise drives those
bastards we could be mining burst on the
if we could ever finish plotting them no
that's not gonna
I've gotten one-and-a-half drives in
that 47 Drive machine RGB plotting um no
I'm not GPU plotting because I put in a
GPU and it like was supposed to work
right there and then it just didn't it
doesn't work automatically oh okay I'll
send you all have to figure it out
anyway I also have a dual Xeon system
that I can start plotting on as well
just to import the plot file yes so I'll
figure it out I'll figure it out but
basically I'm doing a mining side to
adventure side quest adventure where
we're looking at hard drive based - it's
weird it's weird it's pretty cool but
it's weird it's fun I guess but Linus is
evading the question are you evading the
question we're doing a video all right
so let me have a look at what else we
got for topic one question yeah I didn't
even the question yes mining yes
happening I mean we're doing a whole
video series around it what you guys
think was going on what question was
there but you whining no I said
forty-seven drives I'm like mining what
else would I be doing with forty-seven
drives other than petabyte project which
by the way I had a couple people
internally telling me we should be
mining on the inactive petabyte server
super not an option because oh you know
what I actually don't have oh no I do I
do have it I do have it super not an
option because check this out Oh phase
one of the vault is like oh phase one of
the you might want to switch the no no I
just get scared no no no it's fine it's
fine everything is okay
extra large icons no no I hate extra
large icons no I hate large icons which
ones do I want uh medium icons this is
the quality content at all
to ensure this happened where's the
where's the diversity amount what
where's the just property right-click
properties
no no no I'm gonna gives you a fancy GUI
no no no huh I refuse ah content oh
that's an interesting one tiles tiles is
the one so I've only got 40 terabytes
left and when you factor in that Z Drive
needs an offload so this is the nvme
server we're gonna have like 20
terabytes left in the first stage excuse
me sorry sixes Christmas um that's my
girlfriend's fault though
completely it's entirely her fault I was
fine she came over and was like I'm not
sick and then like hours later was just
like coughing up a storm and I was like
thanks for that no I'm no I'm sick
thanks hon yeah so we're gonna have to
roll out the second one very very soon
yeah you don't want it so mining on hard
drives is a very new frontier and
there's not very much data in terms of
like how bad it is for your drive or
anything yeah and those are expensive
drives they're like supposed to be
reliable and stuff yeah speaking of
crypto actually let's jump into this so
the source here is coined Escom coin
check confirms the reason why you should
not use online exchange wallets as much
as it possible
so I'll tell you guys
most of the crypto that I own and I do
have some I bought on an exchange show
them this so most of what I owned I
bought on an exchange but it is not on
the exchange anymore yeah and the reason
for that is that while an exchange is
really convenient so I actually had it
on there for like a week while I was
waiting for my hardware wallet yeah well
in exchange is very convenient when you
and when it was on there I was like oh
well I'll sell some of that
and I'll buy some of that and I'll do
this and like actually I played it right
which is there's not an indication
necessarily of skill but I played it
right it was that a really good time to
be playing yes it was I won bigger than
I lost and that worked out really well
but the way to do it is you get
everything off the exchange and you keep
it in a hardware wallet preferably one
with no online access whatsoever
yeah so there are dedicated devices for
that strongly recommend that you know
and if you've got everything in an
offline wallet then if an exchange gets
hacked your crypto will not be part of
the crypto that gets absconded yeah yeah
Wow
58 billion yen approximately five
hundred and thirty three million u.s.
dollars whoo yeah the precise amount
stolen may not be fully known until
further checks have been carried out
into the intrusion ha ha at least over
400 million sorry I'm just no it's crazy
so the price of the coin which is
specifically nem I'm not entirely sure
which one that is because there's 10
billion different ones but nem coin the
price of that went down 13% which isn't
even like in the grand scheme of how
fast coin values have that bad it's like
an average Saturday like it's not that
big of a deal so it looks like it's
likely greater than the amount stolen
from mount GOx in 2014 when converted at
cash yeah three hundred and forty
million dollars though it should be
noted that given how much less crypto
currencies were worth in 2014 that
proportionally this is a smaller impact
if you convert up mount gox's theft to
what it would be valued at now yeah or
especially a month ago yeah yeah
so that's a thing that happened you know
as usual you're gonna have people on all
sides of this whole this whole crypto
thing that's going on here the bottom
line is this you know I don't think
either of us is anti crypto are you anti
crypto I recognize a lot of the bad
things that are associated with it
crypto as a whole I think is actually
really good I don't know if your block
chain technology technology yeah I don't
know if you've heard what the Canadian
government's planning on yeah that's
super cool do you want to click so okay
I only know rough details about this so
I could get some of it wrong it's not a
topic for this week but the Canadian
government has spoken publicly about the
interest of adopting blockchain
technology for some of its internal
spending of tax money yeah so you can
see where tax money is being spent and
how it's being spent that is awesome
because I have said my entire life that
I personally I'm gonna just show slight
amounts of political alignment here but
I have no area Mar what am I gonna do
fire you hey I have no issue really with
taxes but I would like to know what my
taxes are going towards yeah it's
annoying having a whole bunch of money
taken from you and being like I have no
idea what I just improved because it's
cool to think of like I am contributing
to society with this money yeah but it
would be nice to be able to be like oh
there it goes oh it helped to fix that
road or it yeah contribute to that
school that would be a lot more
fulfilling X percentage of it went to
federal issues why percentage of it went
to local issues you know that would
really give me a better idea of you know
what I would want to say at a town hall
meeting yes whatever else and like sure
maybe some of it went towards Trudeau's
lunch when he was on a trip that has to
be paid for somehow I'm not gonna feel
bad about that I just want to know what
it's doing it'll feel cool if I can know
what it's doing um mr. Nix is post in
chat this is funny what but but I think
both of us I both of us hold crypto I'm
I'm long a couple of different
currencies so take that for what it does
but mister Nyx's you post here in the
forum basically sums up the biggest
problem with it right now
Wow that's worth a hundred thousand
dollars
I hope you know what to do with your
$47,000 if you want go ahead and spend
that two hundred and three thousand
dollars the volatility is real oh yeah
and the lack of regulation something
that gets pinched as a benefit of
cryptocurrency is a huge issue it's also
a huge problem yeah because there's no
well there's there's no regulation you
know and there's great things that come
with that and there's terrible things
that come with it there's terrible
things that come with that there's
basically no there's no laws that
prevent people from manipulating this
much smaller and easier to manipulate
market and oh damn has it happened yeah
what I mean there was that recent
example where it was a bit which ones
the bad one that connect gold oh boulder
cash which one was the one that was
particularly brutal I don't remember
which one but the coin itself wasn't the
problem
yeah yes how it was set up and how it
was promoted and how the other coins
were temporarily abused around its
inauguration and all the coin itself is
not a problem it was the things that
would not be legal in normal markets
that happened around it but I don't I
think it's cash I don't even remember
people are saying it was Bitcoin cash
yeah yeah yeah so I you know I think we
should we should consider doing our own
coin so this is yeah yeah we should
seriously as part of mining adventure I
just got stress pains in my neck as part
of mining adventure we should do we
should be like here's all the ways this
can be manipulated and usually we're
doing you know usually don't buy this
yeah you should list out like these are
all the potential things that we could
do yeah to abuse the creation of this
coin these are the things that we're
going to do late coin Wow oh my god okay
go ahead
I'm sorry I'm still listening there's
got to be some way so that like everyone
that's current oh my god if you could
make that will be such an interesting
version of mining if you sit in twitch
chat and there's a bot that registers
that you're in twitch chat and then it
like sends you coins based on how long
you're in twitch chat before the show
went live but after it was supposed to
go live
so you make money by waiting do
complicated we're just gonna if we do
this I'm sure we're just gonna copy
someone else's open source court code
for their coin and do nothing unique but
that's what most people do anyways so
it's fine they're saying that exists
lots of people want floatplane coin
people want dazeem on what Linus coin
float coin when coin coin lots of late
coin by coin late coin float coin float
coin luke coin heck yeah heck yeah so
you know I think it would be a really
interesting is oh my god that's a
weakened that's what we can reward the
bingo that's how we can distribute coins
at the beginning is generate a whole
bunch we can distribute them through the
bingo game do you know that people want
more and then you can brag and chat with
how much you have so there's like a
social status thing so you can put you
can buy social status because that's how
dirty this whole time with samurai
salesman Luke go home alright why don't
we get into the way that we actually
make money around here heck yeah
sponsors sponsor number one is
spectrum do you find yourself staring at
a monitor all day that can be hard on
your eyes over time and make it tougher
to fall asleep well spectrum is an
affordable long-term solution to staring
at a computer screen using a software
solution like flux or Twilight will not
give you the same type of blue light
filtering that these stylish glasses do
their features include that they're
stylish also that they're made of glass
high-quality one year warranty and the
product is extremely durable another
feature includes
another feature is loquat lock up low
color distortion so compared to other
blue light filtering lenses that I've
seen before I don't feel like I'm just
looking at the world through a blue lens
yeah yeah light sources do look more
yellow it is slice
little bit of yellowing but not very
much but red stuff is still like mostly
red everything just seems like it has an
extremely mild warming filter and
they're the highest rated among their
competitors on Amazon so check them out
at spectrum glasses dot-com slash
collection slashed prospect or at the
link below I'll go ahead and post that
in the chat and you can save 10% off
spectrum glasses using offer code Linus
it's pro spec boom Oh prospect that
could be wrong that big sense you know
what I'm just gonna go with the genius
Lee because that's what I know
Luke that's what I know that's what my
genius is all right so do we have any no
we're gonna do fresh books first and
then we're gonna get upset at the people
who stole our stuff okay fresh books
fresh books is the super simple to use
invoicing tool that actually does a lot
more than just allow you to create and
send slick-looking invoices quickly it
helps you track your time with their
timesheet function manage your expenses
and keep track of who owes you what it
allows you to take payment on your terms
even allowing you to take deposits on
your work before you begin and their
mobile app has all the functionality of
the desktop version including allowing
you to track your time track expenses as
you go and well of course send invoices
one of the best things about it is that
you can see when your client is seen
your invoice and put an end to the
guessing games and if you have any
questions you can reach out to their
support staff where you will speak to a
real live human no phone tree no
escalations no return calls just answers
go to FreshBooks comm slash win and
enter when and how did you hear about us
section when you sign up for your 30 day
free trial I'm gonna go ahead and link
that in the twitch chat as well if you
guys run like a small-time tech repair
shop or she's gotta still be common it
was super common when we were it's gotta
still be common like I did tech work
when I was in high school so did I yeah
like there's like no good reason that I
can think of not to make some money on
the side if you're just passionate but
like these days it might be more based
around fixing mobile phones and stuff
but there's there's still tech work
oh absolutely like battery swaps yeah
what do you like these
are we getting that the add nod of
approval I think so you like the thick
frames on me hey okay huh
you know it's funny I never thought of
myself as a thick frame guy like I don't
know have you seen my prescription
glasses yeah yeah they're like they're
small they're small
yeah I could pull this off you think I
probably need like an overall style
update though yeah yeah all right you
can go cold that's all right bringing us
to our last sponsor savage jerky so they
actually hit Colton you still there
okay so Colton Noether and Colton ran an
investigation
Colton ran an investigation come on come
on over here come over here
we need inspector Colton back I think
remember when you solved the mystery of
people of the utensils yes I do okay my
finest pieces of work here finest
company finest Channel super-fun one of
the finest channels Superfund episodes
of all time and probably the single most
valuable thing Colton has done since he
began his employment investigator we
have to solve another mystery who took
our Savitz Turkey I don't know man I've
been I I sent a message to like our
group a group chat and and no responses
I looked around the office somebody ate
it but the thing is is that we had a lot
we had a lot of water jerky like
somebody must have just gone to town
like you guys have probably seen the
boss yeah it's not a small pretty huge
yeah like there is some of it that's
empty but most of it had quite a bit
yeah they were like there was an easily
one or two zones just jerky we're gonna
we're gonna say this sort of one sit
front and like it's enough that you
couldn't have like accidentally opened
up a package started eating it because
like it's delicious and they're just
like oh no it's gone between many
packages yeah you're like oh 14 packs of
jerky I guess I'll do see ya I guess
this is total
and like some of it was so spicy that
you couldn't conceivably
have eaten it in more than in less than
like many sittings
let me see somebody walking by
somebody's like like if you ate it in
one sitting you wouldn't be sitting Oh
for a while or you you know what I mean
you know what I mean no sitting we're
gonna find it we're gonna track it down
okay so can we ask Savage today they're
sending us more it's that good okay okay
so anyway savage jerky it's made with
the best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives it's a snack that's full
of spice and flavor but isn't bad for
you they've got 13 different flavors I
love the maple buffalo bacon any any mo
whole flavor is excellent the
traditional flavor is excellent that if
you're into it the Carolina Reaper and
the ghost peppers like people people who
was it was mape me that was like yeah
whatever
no jerky is well to savage for me yeah
and then he had like issues the next day
yeah yeah they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub but I'm sure
he tanked it and you can use offer
[Laughter]
because because you don't actually go in
the tank that's gross I use our code
ltte to save 10% on savage turkey fried
eggs oops oh not that we can eat them
and stuff right now yeah yeah they're
good you'll just have to take our word
for it yeah they're yummy
so that's pretty sad if you go down yeah
okay so this was posted by dragoon 20005
on the forum and you know what this
doesn't surprise me at all and it
wouldn't surprise me if this is true of
other motherboard makers as well but as
ROC has said in a statement that it's
aware of the current hold on am i muted
here oh it is aware of the current Intel
micro code version that might be
detected a lot of security vulnerables
working closely
six 100-200 z 370 and X 299 motherboards
it blows me away that X 99 is not
included yeah I like that since that was
a high-end product until June of this
year
yeah gigabyte joined the list last year
despite originally saying their products
weren't vulnerable
AMD joined the list releasing patches to
address both variants of Spectre so here
we go CPU by code update so basically a
soos was the first to address the issue
I mesial so etc so if you are running an
older CPU you know I can see people
shouting forced for system obsolescence
here I can also see the other side where
the manufacturers are going well hold on
a minute this is like four or five year
old product how can we possibly be
expected to be continuing to provide
support for it you know but Wow
one thing I can say is that whoever's to
blame it is not the consumer yeah so
that's a thing and I think that for a
security vulnerability it is fair to
expect to be receiving support and it's
not getting done and there are multiple
issues at play here one of which is a
symptom of the computer industries
overall inability to responsibly manage
itself because I can tell you guys right
now with the margins that they have many
of these companies simply could not
afford to roll out all of these updates
they actually wouldn't have the
engineering bandwidth for it they
actually couldn't do it but this this
sort of points us to an overall larger
systemic problem and that is that the
computer industry and consumers are
partly to blame for this as well has
been on a race toward zero I don't think
so you don't think consumers just
ultimately
turning away from the higher quality
product refusing to spend more for it
and just buying whatever's cheapest you
don't think that contributes I don't
think that's happening that much well
remember this is this is an ongoing
problem we're going back 20 years now
like we're going back to when computers
were treated like you bought a high-end
computer once in a while you bought a
quality one versus being treated like
commodities yeah but I think consumers
are going to do that in any market that
you're in that's how markets work if
it's good enough they'll buy the one
that's cheap enough to fit their field
and when you're looking at like gaming
consumerism you're looking at like okay
I want to play these games I need this
level of thing and then you buy the
cheapest thing that can hit that level
that's okay let me throw a
counter-argument at you because it's not
like there weren't opportunities in the
past for people to learn from a mistake
like buying a motherboard from a cheaper
vendor having it be trash and having
their customer support
I mean people complain about the
customer support of computer hardware
manufacturers incessantly but then they
turn around and they still buy this
stuff like there's an excellent thread
over on Hardware canucks about Canadian
warranty service horror stories and
these resources are out there but the
consumers continue to support vendors
that when you go when you break it down
I guess I'm aren't charging enough in
order to fully staff their support
departments to provide adequate service
I guess you probably know more because
of the sales numbers of being a p.m.
because from my perspective looking at
posts on like our forum and my own
purchasing habits and the person habits
of my friends we buy cheaply but usually
within known constructs like I've dealt
with customer service from a few
companies yeah and I will often buy from
those companies or not based on how the
customer service wins so in the broader
scheme of things it is amazing how much
of a difference people will it's amazing
how many more people will buy something
when it is $4 cheaper but I I feel like
that's got to be a thing across all
markets and the the reaction tools
tools is a great example of people
buying what they believe is quality
because they think it's gonna last it is
hard to break into the market as a cheap
that same time actually you expect to be
able to buy a tool and keep it
potentially for the rest of your life
can write to a computer where you can
keep it for three years
exactly so customer expectations have
shaped how much they expect to spend on
these things which has shaped how much
people can make when they sell them like
it's look I'm not to be clear I'm okay I
should maybe blame is the wrong word
yeah I don't think customers is it is a
difficult thing to do because consumers
are gonna act like consumers act and
always act the same way blame is the
wrong word here but I would say that
consumers and manufacturers have
contributed to what is an overall
systemic problem tributed sure yeah
because we could sit around and like
we've got people saying you know they
should recall all of these they should
do this they should do that that's
stupid it's like it's just a stupid
thing to say because it just doesn't
work that way and everyone just lose
their computers like it's like if it's
like if we released um you know really
would just shut down like you can't yeah
like the whole internet would just shut
down like we don't actually want a world
where MSI gigabyte a Zeus and asrock
they just don't exist we don't want that
we have to find we have to find a
compromise here and it seems like they
think the compromise is 100 series and
up and as a as a okay here as a customer
who's rolling x99 systems in our
production machines I can tell you that
I bought into that and we didn't pay for
all the hardware as you guys know we did
a video about it but we do have money
invested into them so as someone who
invested money into running these
machines in a production environment
seven months ago or eight months ago or
whatever it was
I am super not impressed that I'm not
getting supported here so I don't know
where the right compromise is but I'm
not happy about where we are now and I
guess I I don't really have much more to
say than that yeah
I I think I think I guess the takeaway
from this is pay attention to how
different companies react to this yeah
there that's that's a great takeaway so
guys here I mean what we can link you to
we can link you to the article where
this is being tracked actually no it'll
be on the forum later we'll have it in
the when topics 11 in the lam target
land topics forum and check it out so
find whoever supported this best write
it down put it on a post-it note stick
it to your wall Google box next time you
buy a motherboard buy from them yeah and
let's see if we can start to reverse the
tide because ultimately that's what it's
gonna take
unless the consumer habits change and
these companies feel like they're gonna
get a return on the investment that
they're putting in to support they're
not gonna do it because that's how
business works you invest where you're
gonna get a return so brand loyalty I
think is is generally kind of not a good
idea but I don't see this as a brand
loyalty move because you're making a
logical decision that's based on how a
company acts and like if something like
this was to happen again you're making a
decision that is based on how that
company would react to that situation so
it is actually in putting value into the
product so you can look at the overall
value proposition and go look this has
more value to me I'm going to purchase
it not I'm brand loyal to this company
I'm going to purchase it I've made
purchasing decisions based on companies
one of them that I've told stories of on
the wine show before is EVGA because of
how well they treated me in the past
when I was not a creator right this is
when I was absolutely on my own it's a
long story so I'm not going to go over
it but they were awesome and I don't buy
everything from EVGA clearly you can see
my builds yeah done them here but in
situations where I'm like oh look one of
my options is this and it's pretty darn
close to another one I have often gone
with them but I don't buy their stuff
exclusively at all because I'm going for
what I think is the best value of that
individual point in time do you want to
totally change gears yes posted by se to
Mitch on the forum original articles
from CBC a Canadian has been
charged with spamming twitch what
Brendon Lucas out of the can-spam is
subject to a court order preventing him
from spanning which I know right so the
20 year old has been charged with
mischief in relation to computer data by
the Supreme Court of British Columbia
local guy for allegedly sending a
hundred and fifty thousand offensive
messages through twitches chat
suspensive the messages hit more than a
thousand different channels and included
racist anti-semitic sexist and
homophobic slurs thanks for representing
Canada you could face up to ten years in
prison as well as a civil order barring
him from using creating or selling
certain types of software including any
robot bought crawlers spiders
blacklisting software or other software
that could be used to target the
streaming platform he allegedly used a
service called chat surge whose stated
purpose is to flood destroy or simply
demolish any twitch TV chat room
the bots were posting an average of 34
spam messages per minute on some
channels the rate was 600 messages a
minute
employees at twitch dedicated more than
300 hours to tracing the attacks after
receiving over 375 individual user
reports regarding spam messages
containing racism homophobia sexual
harassment false implications of
viewbotting and soliciting child sex
exploitation material what Wow
so this all all allegedly happened
between February and May of 2017 and he
was charged on December 1st of 2017 Wow
interesting this prompted the company to
file a civil lawsuit on March 31st 2017
against Shaw Communications PayPal
Holdings CloudFlare who is privacy corp
and who is guard Inc
day an Apple was charged on December 1st
of 2017
what if there's a shooting at everybody
speaking of Apple we yeah I was actually
kind of thinking maybe I would do a
video updating people have been asking
where the heck is our iMac pro coverage
oh yeah do you know about this have you
heard about this no oh so we we
accidentally broke it which happens from
time to time yeah no one ever Apple is
outright refusing to repair it even at
our cost what so right now because it's
so new replacement parts are not easy to
get an Apple is just refusing to repair
it so the store contacted Apple HQ and
they were just like no don't don't do it
why yeah that's a wonderful question
isn't it so I was thinking maybe we'd do
a video about that at some point Wow so
did two rossmann that's an interesting
that's an interesting idea well no I
mean okay the issue is not that we can't
repair it it's not not rocket science
it's got a blown power supply and a
broken display we just need a new power
supply in a new display whatever the
issue is that Apple has a brand new
product that for whatever reason not
they aren't equipped to they're not
saying hey give us a couple weeks I
don't know if he's interested or not but
I really feel like tieing Rossman into
this they're saying hey we are not gonna
do it go take it to an Apple certified
repair shop somewhere else Wow yeah like
what's the point of an Apple store yeah
speaking of you know supporting
customers and all that we're not asking
them to do it for free
they even quoted us they told us how
much it was gonna cost we agreed to it
they held it for a few days
and then we're just like what we are not
gonna repair it what yeah no I know no
no no this is like pretty frustrating
what how can
I'm truly something in the contract but
if they take money for something no they
didn't take it yet they just quoted it
but they took it physically right they
took your product yeah they took the
product you should be able to like
charge them a rental fee or some
bullcrap oh you wouldn't be able to do
that if that were the case in every
repair shop anywhere that doesn't end up
being able
fix something would be would be open to
that kind of but that's that's that's a
decision that's not an inability no
that's not a like we tried I could just
say oh you must have misunderstood us we
can't fix it
in which case that's a pretty funny
video either way yeah Apple cannot fix
the iMac from whoo okay so good luck if
it breaks but Rosman probably can't yeah
you probably can um okay last last topic
today this is cool
this is off Windows central.com
Microsoft is building a truly modern
version of Windows 10 for PCs ho named
Polaris they're planning to strip out
legacy components in favor of a more
modern OS with better battery life like
what I don't know what a wonderful
question
apparently better performance it will
feature seashell Microsoft's upcoming
Universal shell that shared across
devices instead of the legacy Microsoft
shell
it will also ditch win32 components and
apps like notepad or paint in favor of a
uwp first experience just like Windows
10 mobile oh wow what it's working on an
updated file explorer built on uwp why
do they do stuff that like just it's
obvious that people will hate okay so
you notice how hard it is to get into
your network settings now yes ever since
the fall created absolutely a nightmare
it's ridiculous like you hear a lot and
then Auto changes settings back you
change something and they'll just set it
back that drives me absolutely bonkers
like you get stuck here now and like I
can never remember is it is it property
no no it's not properties is it
thanks forever love cars are prominent
not Hardware properties is it you know
status it's not intense enough there's
all this white space you have to scroll
for no oh oh wait hold on is it network
and sharing center I think what you're
looking for is oh no I think you can get
to here there we go
finally finally there click finally and
get this if you want to connect or
disconnect a VPN oh my it
the stupid thing it doesn't just connect
or disconnect are you are you kidding me
at least to their credit you can connect
and disconnect a VPN by clear now but
there was an intermediary there was an
intermediary yeah where you couldn't do
this still and you just had to come in
here and do this and every time I loaded
this straight to here it wouldn't work
until I clicked on another tab and then
click back like is shocking help no no
that goes here now the one that you
pointed that goes here what that's the
problem
yeah this goes here I thought that's as
of the last couple of updates what yeah
yes no I was just using that as my
shortcut know you can still right-click
I think and open networking into no
that's still that's this again that's
this no - so there's no straight right
this is never what I want no I can't
think of any reason I would want to look
at this page where's the like how it
handles with home and oh hold on hold on
oh oh this is just bad UI design that's
this is clickable yeah I didn't even
realize this was clickable I thought
this was just crap yeah so you can click
here and you can get to the adapter
settings okay yeah they don't look like
buttons yeah until you hover over them I
viciously hate Windows 10 and it sucks
because this really cool Microsoft
Studios game is in beta right now called
ste of Thieves
yeah and I want to play it and I tweeted
like does anyone have a key and like
awesome Sean from Microsoft is like you
go bro
and then I'm like wait I can't play it
there's someone Windows 8.1 Wow
use the Windows Store it's a Windows
Store game sadly because the Windows
Store is a terrible experience but it
looks like a really cool game so I want
to play it and I don't have any spare
SSDs so I'm gonna install Windows 10 on
a 500 gig momentous XT I think that's
what it's called those like those like
SSD hard drives really just have a lot
of cash yeah I'm gonna install Windows
10 on there OBS Chrome and see if
thieves and that's it and it'll be a
horrible experience because this can be
on a hard drive yes
yeah so if everyone play the game it'll
be on a hard drive because I've just ice
I literally sat there for like half an
hour basically staring at my computer
being like I really want to play sea of
thieves but I really really don't want
to use Windows 10 and that's it came to
there all right so thank you guys for
tuning in to the LAN show oh right um
early access on floodplain yes
huzzah oh do you do you want to talk
about any of the cool stuff that's going
on a full thing can you talk about the
cool stuff that's going on you're
killing blog posts there's stuff
happening I'm not I'm saying it I'm
saying it we processed a credit card
transaction a lot of them a lot of
credit card transactions and they
resumed and they worked and they recent
yes the subscription the subscription
mechanism worked that is a huge
milestone if you've ever like developed
a platform you'll know that that's a big
deal because you can't even do any of
that stuff until you've got a lot of the
other back-end mechanisms also working
and it like associates with accounts and
it grants you access properly and when
your sub dies it takes away process
properly in and what are we talking
about this stuff it's cool I want to
slam a whole bunch of these things
really close to the launch of the
platform okay it's like think of it like
sex a piece no most intense orgasm right
at the end a penis can only be so wide
okay before it just cannot be processed
anymore okay you need to you need to
just calm down that like massive you
know like you know butcher shop meat
size direction and just kind of bang out
these these news updates on insertion
overtime for time is yes one okay so
back to my screen here this could be
quite possibly the greatest ltte video
of all time this is sort of so we
actually almost lost one of our cameras
at CES not gonna name any names I'm
hella
someone left one of our camera bags just
at the bell desk basically and it's just
cold Luca giantic it had I didn't call
him one I said maybe he had one
different ones offensive ones probably I
don't know maybe all depends how
sensitive you are
I got four that's confusing right I got
hardcore SJW dat the Amazon ghost story
oh oh yeah anyway um yeah I had an
encounter I had a real live encounter it
was great I'm sorry yeah anyway so this
video was almost lost because it was on
an SD card that was sitting in that
camera and it is perhaps the greatest
watched LTT video of all time I have
watched bits of it I haven't watched the
whole thing
hold on but we're gonna watch a little
bit of it now along it was so cool this
is like the coolest product of all time
and this is possibly the greatest LTT
video of all time so that's not a
digital screen nope nope nope those are
physical objects yeah

wait until we can put it back together
scammed on eBay six core system it's 19
min
that's a really good video the whole
thing is really good 19 minutes long for
editing on it's good the hosting is good
good job yeah I was a good video yep
great work a prime yeah so we've also
got a couple tech cookies how does
Bitcoin work we've got a lot of really
good feedback on this video people are
saying this is one of the better
summaries out there okay also what our
Pentium gold and silver because who the
crap knows yeah what what Intel's
talking about these days and if you are
subscribed to bit wit and you can also
get a really access to okay Kyle stuff
where is it the happiest place on earth
breaks down is a really wholesome
actually fun to watch video Kyle's has
fantastic humour wifey sauce is
hilarious they go to Disneyland it has
almost nothing to do with tech and it is
great I don't know I like I clicked on
it to be like oh the upload worked in
bubble blow I want to see how the
service is going because some people
whatever and then I ended up just
sitting there and watch the whole thing
and was like I feel good about stuff now
this is gonna be a good day
speaking of the upload working you guys
have retooled a lot of the backend is
the performance on the player still good
oh it should be just my click Wow yeah
it should be good
wow did you guys see that instant
playback I think you might have to play
again oh really oh okay
so this video quality and this is
actually not that great so don't judge
our 1080p based on this and it's going
through twitch yeah not fair anyway
that's a cool poster thingy
the-the-the the pacing and the editing
in the beginning before they go to
Disneyland is really good and then it's
hilarious once they're there I don't
know they just it's good very good
alright so there you go there's the
update on flow plane sort of a lot of
great content over there though so go
sign up if you haven't already and
hopefully very soon we will have annual
subscriptions working again that'll be
by soon so the reason why I launched is
very soon the reason why annual
subscriptions got cut wasn't because I
don't want to give people a discount for
it subscribing annually I absolutely
want to do that because then
that encourages people to subscribe
annually obviously that's why everyone
does that but I didn't want to lock
people onto the current payments
platform because it's garbage
so I'm hoping that we can watch the new
site get you on the new payments
platform then there will be the
discounts for yearly and if you were
subscribed yearly and then now you're
subscribed at monthly don't worry you'll
still be grandfathered into the nice
price and are we gonna find a way to
work that how are we gonna do that okay
we'll figure that out still some things
won't actually be that hard okay okay
cool yeah all right
cool um people want the sjw story ah is
it a good idea I don't know
I don't know no I got a go all right
I'll do it really quick okay I'll do it
really quick so basically you're playing
with fire here I know I don't okay I
know one thing to consider oh no I don't
we are not a federal institution
okay that's fine there is laws against
certain things in Canada anyways okay
okay so anyway I'm kind of done shooting
the piece and I'm I'm waiting to get my
receipt on my phone and so Dennett like
I'm holding the stuff I bought and it's
like kind of awkward because Dennis has
to keep his camera pointed at it because
we want to see the push notification
okay so we like we can't really move so
I've got like I've got these like pads
and we put the food in the bag so I just
have these pads and I have my phone and
like my mic battery's dying so we need
to like swap the batteries and we're
trying to hold everything we're trying
to like anyway um so this person comes
up to me and goes are you guys like
vloggers and I'm like oh yeah and she's
like did I say she the person because
I'm not gonna assume the person the
person kind of makes a face and goes and
as part of your bit that you're here
buying pads and that that's embarrassing
and I'm like and then I don't actually
get a chance to say anything because
that's perpetuating something something
I kind of was tuned out by that point
and and it's totally natural and it's
fine I'm like yeah it is and that's fine
and that's good and as a wife he's
probably buying them for yep
and you know it's one of those it's one
of those conversations where it's like
look honestly I am NOT personally shy
and I don't feel awkward about natural
bodily functions
no because who gives a shit get it but
I'm also not gonna pretend that people
don't feel a little awkward when they
have to go to a drugstore and buy
condoms or yeah tampons or suppositories
anything that goes on your genitals up
your genitals or you know up your butt
is just you know what people feel a
little awkward about that malucia nary
reasons why you feel awkward about those
things and that's fine too
basically the premise of the video is
you know I need to buy something the
original plan was condoms actually the
original plan was was extra small
condoms and I was good it was gonna be a
joke at my own expense because I was
gonna want to buy some condoms they
needed to be obviously I don't need
those because but but the joke was gonna
be I need to buy some condoms and I hate
I hate telling people my size you know
and so you know I need I need a store
that doesn't have cashiers so I'm gonna
drive all the way to Seattle so I don't
have to show the extra small condoms to
the cashier okay and we called the head
and they don't carry condoms so we were
like what's the only like personal care
or personal hygiene product that you
carry and it turned out it was tampons
and pads so we had to adapt it and there
you go that was it and the funny thing
is I was sitting eating my lunch on a
bench in the building next to it and an
Amazon staffer who happened to be female
comes by and she's like oh is your bit
that you don't have to talk to the
cashier about the pads
that's hilarious that's something I
didn't even think of as a benefit for
this store because
when when husbands and boyfriends have
to come in and buy pads and tampons they
can do it discreetly brilliant and and
she goes on on her way which is like
yeah we're allowed to feel awkward and
we were even we were talking we were
talking for a little bit more actually
and I go yeah you know I actually took
flak over this over this angle for the
video and she goes oh you know that's uh
well you know I'm from the East Coast
and I was like well you know I'm west
coast and I got nothing to say about
about that but you know East Coast
sounds great oh man
you know it's just it's one of those
things where people are gonna be
offended or not offended my personal my
personal philosophy on the whole thing I
don't get real personal on the land show
very often but my personal philosophy is
you know what it is very easy to get
offended in life you can get offended by
almost anything it is really hard to get
along and so what we all need to work at
is getting along and if everybody
focuses on that and if we focus on
people's intent rather than on exactly
the words they used or the way that they
used them it would be a better world
yeah that's all I have to say don't
assume people are trying to be jerks
thank you for watching the land show we
will see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel assuming we
haven't been you know assuming we can
get past the picket line of people who
are upset in front of our office yep
they'll see 16 yeah go see 16 is crazy
60 federal institutions you are
essentially as a Billiken
it's really complicated and there's
other bills that affect it so it's a
really difficult thing to understand and
just saying it during the outro is not
gonna make enough sense I would
recommend doing research on it don't
just read the bill because there are
other bills that affect it so it's more
complicated than that anyways</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
