get the XPS 13 what we're gonna soak it
that one no that's my XPS 12 this is the
this is their newer laptop no it rained
last night so this is the state of it
this water is actually dripping out from
inside the notebook yeah this is gonna
be awesome so we're gonna find out if
the XPS 13 can survive being out in the
rain just like its predecessor which
also isn't waterproof so it's not here
for about a week the thing I don't know
yet because the thing that's most like
look at that what right where I left it
what oh my god and I'm supposed to do
stupid things that was an accident the
first time and this time it's also an
accident
Corsairs H ATI GT and H 100 i GTX
all-in-one liquid coolers improve both
the appearance and cooling of your PC
click my shoulder to learn more we're
gonna mix things up a bit now
technically the XPS 13 which I've been
carrying around in my backpack with my
XPS 12 which survived being left out in
the rain overnight you can check out
that video here now I've been carrying
this around in my backpack because I've
been waiting all this time for an
opportunity to find out if the XPS 13
could also survive a similar encounter
with the elements so the first thing I'm
gonna do is fire this bad boy up
gorgeous laptop by the way you guys can
check out my review of it here so I'm
gonna fire it up to show you guys that
it is indeed still working perfectly and
even though this is something that I did
promise to return to Dell I never said
that it wouldn't have been rained on in
the meantime so you know I figure we
might as well put it through its paces
and see how this baby does now I'm not
gonna have it turned on in the rain
because that would probably kill it but
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
allow it to go into sleep that's exactly
the state that the other laptop was in
when it was left out by accident before
so if it's in sleep so so we know this
because once we got it fired up it
actually worked and resumed exactly
where it was
so my battery life is sitting at about
62% and we are going to go ahead and do
that windows 8 - I peed doop de doop
sleep thing sleeps extremely quickly
we're gonna take it outside and in order
to make this as similar to last time as
possible it is sleeping we are going to
leave it on this railing no I think it
was on this table on this table right
here so I wish the XPS 13 the best
today we find out if the XPS 12 survival
was a total fluke or if Bella computers
are made of magic I suspect it was a
fluke but only one way to find out is it
the stupidest thing I've ever done
yes really No did you tell Dell that
you're gonna be doing this no this is
like I can't even look away yeah yeah
I suspect they won't be too impressed
with this particular idea of mine but
hey they were all over promoting the
last one on social media hey look how
great this video ends so surely if you
know yeah but that one was an accident
that one was an accident maybe you were
an accident all right well let's just
leave this here we gotta go so I
actually meant to rescue this thing
right in the morning but I was actually
out of the office all day so it's been
out there for 24 hours which actually I
don't know it might be an advantage
because it kind of dried out out here so
let's go ahead and bring this baby
inside and have it okay well it didn't
completely dry out the bad news for the
XPS 13 is that with the 12 I was able to
you know open it up and start drying it
out right away but I actually have an
engagement tonight and I am NOT gonna
have time to do that right now so
tomorrow not in the morning but after I
go to NCIX to film there I will come
back and take this baby apart I'm gonna
leave it here for now though I'll put it
like that oh I never thought it was a
good idea so it's been a couple days
since I've even touched this thing it's
just been sitting there kind of soggy in
the meantime but I've just been busy so
this is not what I would normally
recommend if something gets wet you want
to crack it open and start airing it out
right away here we go
all right looking not too bad inside
actually oh there's some noticeable
discoloration of that screw bottom panel
flap oh boy it's also a good idea to
take pictures as you go okay batteries
out some definite water seepage down to
the housing for it so if I pick at this
right here you can see very bad news oh
boy yeah I was a lot more confident that
this was a good a while I wasn't I never
thought it was a good idea but I was a
lot more confident that it was less of a
terrible idea when I started really to
any stuff in here that is about as
disassembled as I think we're gonna get
her on this side let's have a look at
that display that I really wish I had
done first
alright so the I fix that chair down
actually has a pretty good look at the
adhesive that Dell is using for their
infinity display glass here without
better tools on hand we may just be Sol
alright I'm defeated for now so I'm
gonna reach out to our friends that I
fix it looks like we need some eye
openers some kind of prying pics of some
sort and I'm just gonna tuck this baby
away I mean it's other than the display
everything else has opened up and airing
out right now boy I sure hope I can put
this thing back together and go get to
it later alright so today's a moment of
truth time let's take this baby out of
the air flow me later and find out if
she works even breaking the fan that I'm
trying to use to heal the laptop but I
probably broke so I fix it clarified a
very important distinction between
they're tear downs and they're repair
guides for me I was following an XPS 13
tear down which is not necessarily
designed to allow you to put all those
different things back together so they
actually informed me that they don't
necessarily have a clear-cut procedure
for putting this display the display
elements back together if I take them
apart which means I'm gonna kind of go
for gold here and hope that the rain did
not penetrate this seam why would I not
label these oh no this is not going to
be a good day oh that's interesting
maybe I can actually look at some of the
pictures that I took oh I can't so well
oh you know what I'll put the speakers
back first mind you at this point we are
ready to find out if there's even a
point in putting the speaker's eye
unscrewing the speaker's back in because
we are about to find out if this bad boy
works this is it moment of truth time we
have a light we have a keyboard
backlight no way Wow oh okay
picks up right where it left off we have
done it again folks whether by luck or
by skill or by the marvelous engineering
of the products that we that we decide
to do this - we have resurrected another
wet laptop let's just make sure the
screen screen works touch screen works
let's go ahead and just like find
something we can like yeah multi-touch
still work
we'll do a quick keyboard test make sure
that still works touchpad touchpad still
works this is a test what's a test I
think we're good to go wow I can't
believe this thing is functioning holy
cow
