first to get our hands on an 8k monitor
it was from Dell on the thing as a
creators dream thanks to its hundred
percent coverage of the Adobe RGB color
space and true 10-bit color the only
problem is that come on to be truly
creative especially when you've got a
bunch of different design tools and file
explorers and web browsers open you
really need a multi-monitor setup and
now we have just that today we're going
to be showing off a badass workstation
with not one but two 8k monitors and
we're going to be powering those things
within videos
brand-spanking-new $9,000.00 Quadro GV
100 and this video is brought to you by
Mac Weldon Mac Weldon makes high quality
shirts socks wallets and more they
believe in simple shopping and if you
use code tech tips you'll get 20% off
through the link below
so let's start by having a look at what
we would consider to be basically an
ultimate workstation at this point we
ended up choosing a very subdued case so
this is the corsair 600 q and unlike a
lot of the really popular options that
are out there right now
it's got no RGB no tempered glass no
nothing it's just a plain black box with
a nice included fan controller and ample
room for any kind of cooling you could
possibly want to put in it for our CPU
we went with obviously the core I 979
ATX C so that's an 18 core processor
turbos up to 4.2 gigahertz or something
crazy like that we've got a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of G skills Trident CR
GB RAM okay yes I know it's RGB but
that's not why we chose it it's just one
of the only kits that we had a 128 gig
kit of for our motherboard we've gone
with these Zeus's WS X 299 sage now we
could have gone with the WS c 422 pro SC
that we checked out recently but we
determined in our video covering the
Zeon W for the 2066 platform that the
value just wasn't really there unless
you need ECC Ram and besides the X 299
sage has seven PCI Express slots meaning
we can put basically anything we want in
here for our SSDs we went with two
samsung 960 pros each of them 512 gig
running in raid 0 and then for our power
supply we went with a see sonic 80 plus
titanium unit it's only 750 watts but
quite frankly quite frankly that's more
than we really need anyway bringing us
to of course the centerpiece the Quadro
GV 100 we've only got one of these so we
won't be using the envy link connections
that you can use to not only double your
processing power but also share ran
between them but for the kinds of
workloads that we're going to be able to
put on this thing anyway it's improbable
that we will actually need more RAM than
one of these cards has a
each of them is equipped with 32
gigabytes of high-speed HBM to memory to
go along with their 5120 cuda cores and
640 tensor cores so these are designed
not just for your sort of traditional
workstation usage but also for AI and
deep learning applications let's go
ahead and get it installed alright now
that we've got it in we can see we're
gonna be using every single one of the
DisplayPort 1.4 outputs on this card
because each of our 8k monitors requires
two of them okay so while we wait for
this to power up I want to take you guys
for a little tour of our desk here
because as you might have noticed it
looks really different from one of our
more typical gaming setups because when
your focus is productivity the kind of
gear that you're using needs to be a
little bit different so first of all
obviously we'll get to the visuals in a
little bit here is sound now gamers
might want speakers and the same
actually goes for their headphones that
accentuate details that are important to
gameplay like say for example the
frequency of footsteps so that they can
pick out where opponents are around them
not so for content creators so these
here are audio engines a 5 plus
bookshelves they have a flatter response
curve not quite like you would consider
you know studio monitor grade response
curve but a flatter response curve and
they represent a good value because they
can connect directly to your PC unlike
some other monitors that used balanced
XLR inputs for example now for audio
again for the typical gamer pretty much
anything will do you can actually use
your onboard audio no issues there but
we've gone with a combination from shit
audio so yes that is what they're
actually called I know so we've got our
emoti - this is a DAC and then we're
using a Valhalla to
amp that should pair really nicely with
our Odyssey LCD 2s now to be clear the
LCD 2s are especially now that they've
been replaced by other models not
necessarily the be-all and end-all of
headphones but what they are is an open
backed design giving a very natural
sound stage and they use planar magnetic
drivers so to put it in layman's terms
they sound absolutely bitchin I mean
this is something else I obviously we've
seen one of them before but this amount
of real estate so I mean we're scaled at
300% right now so check this out
if I change it to a hundred percent look
how small the cursor is look how small
the start button is wait here if you
open a web browser this is the default
window size so while unlike the early
days of monitor resolutions increasing
we don't necessarily get to benefit from
it just scaling linearly the amount of
desktop real estate that we have the
pixel density though the fineness of the
image is absolutely incredible so each
of these is 76 80 by 4320 meaning that
we've got a total of 67 million pixels
total and of course it's being driven at
60 Hertz like you can see individual
feathers moving around I'm actually
impressed we're running this at full
resolution right now is this 8k footage
Brendan Poole the computers definitely
feeling the burn check this out
82% CPU usage but it's not buckling
not bad now that we've got a bigger
project loaded up it is definitely
suffering a little bit more but I think
part of that might be a network
bottleneck that's one thing that we're
still missing on this particular config
but I think that we could fix pretty
easily with a 10 gig card or something
along those lines
it is definitely nice to have all this
real estate though like being able to
watch at the maximum size of a preview
like what is effectively probably what
like a 720p video as you scrub through
it like this that's pretty incredible
check this out we can pick exactly the
right moment for a thumbnail without
even ever opening it I could actually
watch a video like this I gotta say I do
wish there was a way with our building
layout to reconfigure our editors
machines so that they can use monitors
like this because like all of a sudden
you can actually feel the stereo sound
where applicable so like in the game for
example and it sounds so much more
natural than when you have it pipe
through headphones even really good ones
but I don't think any kind of extensive
renovation like that is on the horizon
any time soon and neither is an upgrade
to do late K monitors and a 5 pluses for
all of our editors anyway so yeah unless
of course we can do it with the help of
sponsors like fresh books fresh books is
the small business accounting software
that's custom-built for how you want to
work it's a simple way whether you're a
freelancer a small business owner to be
