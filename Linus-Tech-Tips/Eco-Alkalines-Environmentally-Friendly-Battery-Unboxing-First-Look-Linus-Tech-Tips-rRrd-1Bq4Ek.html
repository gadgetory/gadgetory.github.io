not rechargeable batteries these are
your standard run-of-the-mill
plain-jane alkaline batteries but there
is something special about them so I'm
gonna go ahead and point out here
earth friendly landfill safe so these
are batteries that are supposedly eco
responsible they contain 0% cadmium lead
and Mercury and their digital alkaline
batteries by the way and they are
landfill safe meaning that they are
there it is
patent-pending leak resist sealed they
are equipped with a patent-pending
libras it's seal so today more and more
people are mindful about the products
they use every day and their associated
environmental impact in global warming
contributions here we have a co2 carbon
footprint thermo DD by purchasing
ecological and batteries you're doing
your part to reduce the co2 and climate
change impact brought about by the
production distribution of disposable
and batteries asteroids Nancy attics
does not take a stance on the global
warming issue so you know just throwing
that out there but I'm just telling you
guys what the manufacturer has to say
eco alkaline batteries are progressive
high-quality consumer batteries with
performance rivaling national leading
alkaline battery brands interesting okay
do not recharge these batteries if they
are recharged then they will break okay
so hold on hold on let me get them all
let me see what else they have to go
okay I'm gonna total mess here let me
see what else they have to say for
themselves so they are certified carbon
neutral and the world's first but I'm
gonna find where that Asterix goes and
I'm gonna find out what it's all about
hold on where's it go
okay I can't find it okay about
carbonfund.org so leading nonprofit the
provider of carbon offset and climate
solutions organizations make it easy to
okay ah carbon offset enables
individuals work in the department which
has the first carbon neutral product
label in the US equal alkaline batteries
are certified carbon neutral okay so
here's all the details the Asterix
doesn't go anywhere in particular it
just refers to the pamphlet itself so
here are the test results which you can
view online showing the Eco alkaline
versus Duracell energizer and Kirkland
that's the Costco burn end of all things
okay
we've also got the pretty much the same
stuff that we covered on the back of the
box
and the front of the box and today
consumers are more aware of the
environmental impact of the products
they use every day create a better
management plan batteries in Canada Wow
look at that more than two hundred and
ninety-six million Park kilometers
equivalent co2 are created by the
manufacturer distribution use and
disposal of alkaline batteries in Canada
all other batteries carry at least one
of the three elements above that means
cadmium lead and Mercury other brands
may limit the usage by maintaining
levels below the 0.9% that allows them
to be called free but these harmful
chemicals are still present interesting
that's up to 900 times more dangerous
materials than eco batteries eco
alkaline brand batteries have zero these
heavy metals I mean that to me is more
than almost anything else the big thing
here I mean there's the carbon neutral
stuff there's the not leaking which is
well actually critical but then the fact
that they don't contain the heavy metals
in the first place and if they can still
provide the same performance that you're
gonna get from another alkaline battery
then great why not
so guys thanks for checking out my
little unboxing in preview or feature or
whatever you want to call it of the Eco
alkaline batteries and don't forget to

unboxings reviews and other computer
