alright guys welcome to the cheero booth
who will be checking out three different
batteries but first one is going to be
the energy plus twelve thousand milliamp
hour ingress addition battery this isn't
just a normal battery it also has some
extra technology inside of it so if you
happen to be using ingress while trying
to charge your phone on this battery not
only will it be more efficient and not
ruin your battery or your phone but it
will also take some of the infor
information from the game and display it
on your battery pack which is pretty
cool there's a whole bunch of different
default colors if you want to display
your colors if you want to be more
anonymous you can change that manually
on the battery and some information like
I said will be able to come from the app
to the battery so different nodes that
are around you will change color
depending on what team currently has
them next is the cheer Oh tough 9,000
milliamp hour this is a very cool little
device it was made out of inspiration
from the victims of the tsunami in Japan
and it's like its namesake very tough
its shock resistance water resistance
drop resistance all that kind of stuff
they even had the CES guys tested out
for water resistance and it passed with
flying colors it also has a built-in
light which you can turn on and I like
that it takes two presses to turn it on
it takes two presses in rapid succession
to turn it off so that you're not
accidentally turning it on and off in
your pocket or wherever else it may be
one thing I really like about this
battery is it's great for something like
a go-bag if you want to have if there's
hurricane warnings or something like
that and you want to build up a go-bag
you can throw this battery in there and
it will be very good for that
you know cheero uses all Panasonic
Japanese batteries that will last a
really long time so you don't really
have to worry about it deteriorating
much in your go-bag and last but not
least is the cheero handy this is more
of the fashionable type of battery pack
compared to the other two as a pleather
refinish and a built-in cable for
charging and for microUSB if you need a
lightning connector there's a microUSB
on the battery bank where you can adapt
from micro USB to lightning to charge
your iPhone also to check the battery
level on the handy all you need to do is
shake it then they'll display the
battery for you quite easy
nice little fashionable device all of
these batteries will be coming out in
the next couple months with the TUF
