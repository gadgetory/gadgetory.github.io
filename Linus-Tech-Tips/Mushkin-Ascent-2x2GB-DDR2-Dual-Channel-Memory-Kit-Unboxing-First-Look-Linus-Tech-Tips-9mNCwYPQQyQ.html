of memory on my show in general and
there is a reason for that so first of
all actually I should start with my
intro I'm going to be unboxing on muskan
black line kit of memory today so this
features their ascent heat spreaders and
that is one of the key differentiating
factors which leads me to why I don't
really unbox the whole lot of memory
there's not much to it you find a good
refutable manufacturer that offers good
support muskan in this case offers
lifetime warranty on all other memory
sticks then it comes down to a few key
things you get the right kind of memory
so if you have a ddr2 system you buy
ddr2 ddr3 ddr3 and so on and so forth
then you've got your capacity this is a
two by two gig or four gig kit and so
you can actually find that along with
capacity one of the ways you increase
capacity is to have more sticks so you
might have a dual channel kit with two
sticks so you might have a triple
channel kit with three sticks depends
what kind of a system you're running so
memory comes down to voltage and speed
that's pretty much it so a kit that runs
at a reasonable voltage and runs at a
good speed and that speed can be both in
megahertz as well as in terms of timing
one general rule that you can use when
you're picking out a memory kit is that
every speed bin increase in the
frequency of the RAM so that means if
you go from pc2 6400 up to pc2 8500 is
worth the same as about across the board
a1 reduction in the latency so a pc2
6400 c4 kit is about equivalent to a pc2
8500 c5 kit which is what we have here
today wow that was a long intro I'm
terribly sorry why don't we just have a
closer look at these modules and then we
will be on our way so first of all the
back of the box has instructions on how
to install muskan memory watch closely
and then thumbs up win okay awesome so
let's get the Box open
okay and the first module I love their
ascent heat spreaders I mean these
things are actually like they're heavy
they have some real weight to them even
though they're made out of aluminum so
you can look down the heat spreader so
you can see that the fins actually go up
quite high from the top of the module
now these aren't like corsair dominator
zin that there's actually another level
of PCB that goes up higher than the
module so they're not quite as high
profile and they're going to have
overall better compatibility with most
motherboards and coolers as a result of
that now why don't we turn it around to
the side so you can see there's a nice
brushed aluminum finish on the heat
spreader itself you got a little sticker
there telling you that your warranty is
void if you remove it oh it doesn't even
say that well you're going to warranty
is void if you remove it it also tells
you the speed that your module is
running out as well as the latency so
that means that if you ever get confused
you can just check right on the side of
your module and you can set the
appropriate settings in the bios now if
you actually look down into the I don't
know if you can see that or not but if
you look kind of into the module you can
see that there's actually a um a copper
layer under the aluminum so that's where
you're going to get some of the cooling
from this particular heat spreader i
believe the ascents use like a vapor
chamber design in order to get maximum
cooling for the module so why don't I
just grab the other one just for the
sake of completeness and showing to you
together and that pretty much concludes
my unboxing of the musk in black line
pc2 8500 for gig c5 REM kit now this is
going to be kind of an overall unboxing
of their ascent heat spreader so take it
for what it is and these guys just get
into everything look at this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
