learn more welcome to my unboxing of the
be quiet shadow rock - it's designed in
Germany QC in Germany and I actually
like has some heft to it in spite of the
fact that this CPU cooler it's an air
cooling heatsink is designed to be
pretty compact so better compatibility
especially with cases so that you're
able to get lots of cooling so high
density in a small area so the first
thing we find when we open it up is of
course mounting hardware
nice solid heavy mounting hardware some
people like things to be lightweight
others like them to be heavy that's what
I like nice heavy back plates nice solid
steel hold downs anything else is just
sort of terrible and you probably
shouldn't use it to be perfectly honest
alright so opening it up further we get
a user's manual which is black and white
and in a variety of different languages
including Z German and then next up
we've got this is actually kind of
unique I haven't seen this before
so the design of the box has little
holes punched in it so it holds the top
the caps from the heat pipes in place to
keep the heatsink from shifting around
during shipping this way they're able to
avoid having a piece of foam on the top
of the heatsink and they can just have
one on the bottom making the packaging a
little bit more environmentally friendly
so once we open it up we find a pretty
simple overall heatsink design so there
are four eight millimeter heat pipes
attached to an extremely shiny base so
we'll do that obligatory finger shot
right there where you guys can see it's
basically a mirror to be clear a mirror
finish is not necessary for heat
transfer but it's obviously easier to
achieve if the surface is flat and it's
one of those things that some
manufacturers throw in just for a debt
bling bling the overall design of the
pool or other than that remember guys a
lot of the time for heat sinks it's more
to do with the quality of the heat pipes
then necessarily the the thickness of
them or the configuration of them so the
rest of the design of the heatsink is
actually pretty straightforward it is a
straight up box looks just like that
with heat pipes that are positioned so
that they're carrying heat
the entire width so to get the best
performance out of this heatsink please
don't mount the fan on these sides
because then a lot of the airflow that
goes through it is going to be wasted so
rather you want it if you wanted it in
push-pull you go this way to this way
unfortunately it doesn't include the
clips you'd need to mount an additional
fan out of the box but you could
obviously jury-rigged something if you
really wanted to the top has a brushed
aluminum finish that's quite striking I
would have preferred black personally
but this is a nice finishing touch so
the little texture on the top of the
heat pipe cat pipe caps and the fact
that they kept the heat pipes at all
because normally heat pipes have kind of
a finished end and an unfinished end and
many manufacturers just leave both of
those exposed the fan that's included is
one of their silent wings fans so these
are extremely well regarded fans out
there I wouldn't have minded seeing some
noise isolation rubber pieces in between
the fan itself but honestly I'm not
feeling inclined to take too many marks
off for it because in terms of pricing
it's a very reasonably positioned heat
sink so if it doesn't have all the
little extras and bells and whistles I
guess we can let it go as long as they
don't skimp on the stuff that's
important like the backplate so I think
without further ado I'm gonna hand this
off to Slick where you can give you guys
his subjective take on how easy or
difficult it was to mount as well as
performance numbers on our standardized
heat sink test bench I'm going to
compare this cooler to its closest
competition the Noctua
NH - u 14s it's bigger and slightly
better performing which is fairly
self-explanatory as you can see the
graphs but the installation process was
the biggest difference for me I actually
had a lot of trouble with it and ended
up calling Linus in and having him do it
because I have much larger hands than he
does and you don't get to use the long
extended screwdriver method that you do
with the knock - one you have to reach
under the cooler and screw things in or
use the wrench but the wrench was pretty
much impossible to use for most angles
because the motherboard we were using
and my hands couldn't really fit under
the cooler in any usable way so the
installation process was pretty rough
and I had to get outside help if I was a
consumer and purchased this I would have
had to get someone else to do it as well
or I would have just had to return it I
literally couldn't screw in I think it
was the top left hand corner screw so
that was actually kind of a problem but
other than that it performs pretty well
and
it's not too big I fit fairly large size
ram under it so that was pretty okay and
that's about it if you liked the video
like the video if you dislike the video
dislike the video and in the comments
below
what are you going for are you going for
a big cooler that cool is really really
well are you going for that one that is
kind of slim and look sleek and let's
all of your RAM fit perfectly and as
