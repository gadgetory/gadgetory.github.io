video to my gtx 660ti content now you
can see here I've got two 660ti running
I've got the msi 660ti power Edition as
well as galaxy's custom cooled GC card
now for those of you who don't know yes
you can mix vendors in sli yes you can
mix different clock speeds in sli
different PCBs in SLI mean this one's
even running two 6-pin powers and this
one's running a six and an eight
different coolers in sli the thing
that's important is that the GPU is the
same so that means you have to have a
660ti and a 660ti no 660ti and then you
know 670 or anything like that no
flexibility on the nvidia side unlike
the AMD side recon at 6990 with a 69 70
and tri fire this doesn't work that way
so just because the 690 has the same GPU
as not that I think there's a 680 around
here somewhere but I'm not going to
worry too much about it ah there it is
right hiding as a 680 that doesn't mean
you can run them in sli got to be
matching GPUs also it's been suggested
to me in the past that mismatched Ram
configurations are ok but I haven't
tried it in a long time and the last
time I tried it it didn't work so there
you go all right so we are going to be
doing like a value analysis because
people ask me about this all the time
should I buy one powerful card or should
I buy two less powerful cards and run
them in SLI so there are some trade-offs
right off the bat 2 cards is going to
use more power period it's going to be
noisier period because you got more fans
in this case you got 4 fans versus one
but which isn't to say necessarily the
two of these fans is louder than one of
these fans but well whatever moving on
so yes power noise both worse heat is
worse for having multiple cards and in
90% of cases multiple cards is bad
never run two of these instead of one
more powerful one that is a low-end card
well well it's a gaming card but it's a
low-end Gaming card and you're
definitely better off getting something
in the sort of more
bang for the buck 250 to 350 dollar
range that's where you usually find the
best value so we're going to take two
660ti s versus a single 680 and find out
what delivers the best performance on
the best value so here's my first graph
this is crisis to 1080p I'm using all my
standard settings so this is like uber
doubt with high res textures and all
that good stuff so you can see the 660ti
configuration actually well destroys the
680 however it is more expensive it's
about 20% more expensive and when we
actually go ahead and look at the
performance differential it looks like
the 60 CTI comes ahead so it's about 26%
faster and 20% more expensive and at
minimum fpi if you measure minimum FPS
it's about 20% faster there as well so
let's go ahead and you know what I'll do
the graphs off camp battlefield 3 again
was running at like uber settings 1080p
and you can see the 660ti again just
destroys it in terms of average FPS but
the minimum FPS was a little bit closer
so it doesn't look like as compelling a
value as as it at first appears when you
look at the averages however that still
does show that the 660ti does present a
better
SLI does present a better value than a
single 680 in this particular title as
long as you're willing to make those
trade-offs in terms of power consumption
as well as noise again running a game at
1080p with ultra-high details and again
we see at that minimum FPS level a 20%
improvement from the 660ti sli config
over the 680 we see about a 47 percent
improvement in average FPS but it almost
looks like Nvidia knew what they were
doing when they were pricing out a
single GTX 680 versus 660ti SLI because
they're delivering pretty much the
performance that you'd expect for the
dual the dual GPU configuration versus
the single one you know what here I'll
just do this last one
on okay no I won't do this on camera I
need to ends and there's Metro 2033
where we actually see about a 30%
improvement in both minimum and average
FPS so this is the clear winner so
what's neat about this cross-section of
games is that these are all well they're
all shooters they're all demanding which
you're to isn't a shooter actually
they're all demanding and they all
demonstrate that the 660ti not only
scales consistently in sli but presents
a compelling value versus buying a
single higher in GPU that is to say that
that's not to say though that it's
necessarily the better option because
two of these is 600 bucks one of these
is 500 bucks and for that 20%
improvement you are trading off extra
heat and extra power consumption so it's
up to you personally I think SLI cards
look more bling-bling and yeah I think
that's probably all else that is got
going for it but remember guys when
you're trying to figure out if a dual
GPU configuration makes sense you just
want to look at performance per dollar
that's pretty much the only factor here
because they've now got the same
features they both support three plus
one videos out even when you add another
card if you're running an sli you can
only plug the you can only plug in three
plus one in sli and this one also
supports three plus one off of a single
card you also want to remember that
things like memory configurations are
important so when you're running two
cards in SLI to two gig cards does not
equal four gigs of video memory okay so
they both have to share the frame buffer
which means that you still only get
effectively two kicks so bear that in
mind as well so I know this really
didn't have a clear-cut conclusion
because basically performance per dollar
they're very very similar just comes
down to do you want a little bit more
performance or do you not on a little
bit more performance thanks for checking
