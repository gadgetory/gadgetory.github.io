our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys
in the a sous booth they had booth sweet
whatever you want to call it they have
the cube this is a google TV ready
device that has a lot of very very cool
stuff so i'm going to show you the cube
first this is an ARM processor it's got
four gigs of on-board storage it's got a
USB Drive it's got one gig of ram it's
got Ethernet it's got hdmi in an HDMI
out and that's cool we're going to show
you why actually what's kind of behind
me already anyway but no big deal I are
out so you can synchronize it with with
an IR blaster and make sure that it sort
of acts as a hub for passing signal
street or whatever else you need power
in and it basically looks like well a
cube so that's appropriately named more
important than that is the remote so
it's fully Netflix ready okay it's got a
touchpad and buttons so you can decide
how exactly you want to use that their
device so the home button takes oh yeah
it's got a full keyboard on the back did
I mention that already i'm pretty sure
that i did not it's got all of your main
buttons that you're going to need your
back your your microphone there's
another microphone button here that is
for controlling the device with google
voice volume up/down channel scroll and
now let's take it over to the working
model that hopefully i haven't ruined so
it's running Android Honeycomb and they
have done a custom UI here that is very
visual so care should i move over sort
of this way so i want you guys to look
at this basically you navigate it with
the remote so you can see all of your
frequently used nope if i'm not doing i
might be doing this wrong somehow we'll
be back in a moment i figured it out i'm
in touch pad mode see i changed it to
touch pad mode when I was tinkering with
it so let's go ahead and switch that out
of touch pad mode so now we can click
the buttons we can navigate me go
netflix primetime so primetime is
google's way of aggregating all of your
content whether it's web content or
whether it's the actual your your TV
service providers content you can browse
all that stuff IMDb is on there we're
going to flip it around here so you've
got your movies your games this also is
motion sensitive so you can play motion
control games I actually clicked the
microphone button so i'm using google
voice right now we'll see what it comes
up with your guys
I was talking for a while there but
it'll do its best go google you know you
know we love you click the microphone so
i'm using google voice right now so you
look at that it's like bang on so now i
just have to go back so that we're not
looking at that anymore there we go so
game social in life so you've got a full
web browser chrome is on here you can
set things up exactly the way you want
so TV there we go if i go to here we go
here's the app store i guess it's called
google play now not app store that's
totally the wrong thing to call it at
all and now all I see so I was in the
education hub so I it's contextual very
cool on the side it's totally different
stuff depending on there you go what
you're looking at so let's have a look
at the at the prime time you I ok and
last but not least I want to show you
guys the live TV button so this not only
allows you to just switch to and watch
your live TV but also you click it so
you go to your live TV now you go to the
home screen and it'll actually still
play in the background while you're
doing whatever it is you want to do so
very cool stuff and don't forget to
