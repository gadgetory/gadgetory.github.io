unboxing this is the p55 ud5 so this is
their step down from the ultra premium
ud6 so we're gonna have support for a
lot of the high-end features of the ud6
but it'll be cut down in a couple small
ways so it features 12 phase power
compared to the 24 phase power on the UD
6 but we still go out a lot of high-end
stuff like SLI crossfire X and obviously
support 4 gigabytes ultra durable 3
technology and smart 6 which is a
variety of different ways of smartly
managing your system which I finally
looked up most of the time I don't run
those sort of bundled motherboard
utilities anyway though anyway okay
let's get this board open so here we go
accessory package we have again quite a
complete accessory package so we've got
4 SATA ports one I cables one IDE cable
then we've got a flexible SLI bridge
we've got your smart 6 user guide your
smart trusted platform module guide
we've got the regular motherboard user
manual along with a drivers and
utilities DVD then we've got the
multilingual installation guide book so
that's your Quick Start Guide then here
we've got 2 eSATA ports and 1 mol export
IO bracket adapter thingy then we've got
2 molex to SATA power adapters and then
2 SATA to eSATA cable so that allows you
to take a couple of just regular joe
hard drives with no special enclosures
and plug them directly off the back of
your computer to use an eSATA mode so
then we've got our i/o shield Dolby home
theater sticker gigabyte system sticker
and let's get down to the board there's
actually like a foam padding thing here
that's kind of neat guess it protects
the protects the Northbridge heatsink ok
so let's get this baby open and have a
look so like I mentioned before we've
got a 12 k phase power design on this
board 12 phases for the CPU itself and
then 2 phases for the uncork so they're
really really serious about providing a
lot of power
every component of your system here all
right so let's have a look at the
general layout of this port it's
actually quite similar to the UD six so
we've got our socket 1156 right where it
belongs your twelve phase power is right
here all around the CPU socket then
you've got quite a robust cooling
solution for the whole board so from the
Southbridge Northbridge and mosfet areas
are all adequately cooled with kind of a
funky funky design going on on the sides
of all of them that's kind of neat so
your power connectors are right where
they belong with the a pin up at the top
left and the 24 pin over on the right
and you've got dual channel ddr3 memory
like all p55 boards now that's one
feature again that is missing from the
UD six when you step down to the UD v is
you don't have those extra two memory
slots okay so let's have a look at the
PCIe layout so this is a PCIe 16x slot
and this is a PCIe 16x physical but
eight X electrical now both of these can
be run in 8x8 X mode for SLI or
crossfire this one down at the bottom is
only a 4x slot and it runs off the
chipset so you can't use it for SLI or
crossfire functionality so we've got
onboard clear CMOS onboard power and
reset switches here and then we've got
our 10 10 say the two ports on the back
and now let's just have a look at the
back i/o so here we go we've got a ps2
mouse keyboard combo port then we've got
one two three four five six 10 USB ports
two of which are USB eSATA combo ports I
really like to see those those are cool
then we've got digital audio out
firewire we have two Gigabit Ethernet
and then we have 7.1 audio and oh yeah
we've got power circuitry on the back
but not quite as much as on the UD six
so thank you for checking out the p55
ud5 from gigabyte</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
