you requested a review of NZXT s340 case
that is until I watched the promotional
video for it on NZXT s YouTube channel
what is this nonsense NZXT your video
contains no information about the case
so I get it now I understand why you're
here watching my video you'd like to
know more than this about the s340
so here we go corsair gaming RGB
keyboards feature precision cherian x
RGB key switches for sixteen point eight
million color / key backlighting for
virtually unlimited customization click
now to learn more
ok blah-dee-blah and ZX T's packing
materials they kind of suck two out of
the seven new egg reviews mentioned
shipping damage but NZXT doesn't seem to
care so I'll just quickly mention closed
cell foam and how great it is rather
than waxing philosophical about it for
five minutes and then we can move on for
the case itself we'll start as usual
with an exterior tour at the front we
find a flat solid piece of glossy black
sheet steel with an NC XT logo stamped
on the bottom and otherwise nothing of
note on the right side we find well
pretty much the same thing but with no
NZXT logo stamped this time on the left
side we find more of the same but this
time with a window and then finally on
the top aside from the two USB 3 ports
steel plated audio jacks an illuminated
power button and and up to 140
millimeter fan slot with an included
120mph end more metal but this time with
a regrettably much less scratch
resistant matte finish on it it won't be
a deal-breaker if you don't regularly
store stuff carelessly on the top of
your case but for those who do well you
might need to learn to be a bit more
careful because it does scratch quite
easily at the back we find the second of
the two included 120 millimeter fans
this time in a 120 mil only mount 7
vented PCI expansion slots with exposed
thumb screws for easy access and a power
supply
I'm mounting bracket that's removable
and features the same captive thumb
screws that you'll find on the side
panels
I love these captive thumb screws
they're an awesome inclusion because I
hate losing case screws on the bottom of
the case is the least exceptional power
supply fan filter ever and some nice
tall rubber bottom feet that keep the
case up for better airflow and keep your
power supply from dying if you install
it fan side down and then put your case
onto a carpet finally around to the
front again for a moment will pop off
that bezel to find a much better this
time actually magnetic fan filter for
those front fan mounts that support
either dual 120 or dual 140 millimeter
fans and a matching radiator these fans
should have great access to fresh air
through the bottom that I mentioned
before as well as the open slot at the
top of the front bezel opening up the
case we find that NZXT has done a great
job of hiding the cost-saving measures
that make this case so affordable and
providing an equally surprising number
of little extras that customers will
enjoy I mean sure the PCI thumb screws
are just open there and that was a bit
of a cost-saving measure and the paint
finish is internally that matte finished
not super durable but all the edges are
rounded to protect your wires and
fingers the entire inside even all the
wires is black the motherboard standoffs
are pre-installed with a post in the
middle one that holds your board in
place while you screw in the rest and
you even get that sweet stealth PSU
cover from the h4 40lb it without the
illuminated logo I think the most
striking thing about the interior is how
spacious it seems in spite of the cases
small size instead of filling up the
front with drive mounts it's taken up
entirely by the radiator mounting points
although it should be noted that dual
120 millimeter rads will have some
orientation flexibility but dual 140
millimeter odds going this way oh this
way only and a top to bottom or top to
basement at least shield that seems to
serve two purposes one as a structural
support and second as a stealth cable
management cover great idea
speaking of cable management all
main bases are covered with non
grommeted holes around the motherboard
tray in sensible places to pass through
fan connectors and the eight pin eps
connector on the top and spots on the
bottom four front panel USB audio and
buttons and the SSD connectors for the
two two and a half inch mounts that are
on top of the stealth basement cover
this SSD mounting is a carryover from
the H 440 that I'm really happy to see
because I think it looks nice but in the
event that you want a graphics card in
the second slot from the bottom or even
some single width cards in the bottom
slot you may find yourself needing to
use the other drive mounting points that
I didn't like nearly as much built into
the front bottom of the case is either a
two and a half inch or three and a half
inch mount that is accessed by sliding
the drive in from the side then screwing
it in from the bottom and then above
that one is two more three and a half
inch mounts that are only sturdy enough
if you ignore NZXT instructions to only
screw in your drives from the front of
the case and make sure you screw them in
from the inside as well something you'll
need to either remove your power supply
for or find a stubby screwdriver in
order to do none of these mounts include
any anti vibration mounting making them
in my mind the weakest part of the
design of this case back to strength
stone in spite of the narrow width and
therefore limited cable management space
behind the motherboard tray NEX team
managed to make it super easy to build a
clean-looking machine in here to go
along with the ample CPU cutout for
cooler installation they've got tons of
cable management leaves back here easy
logical roots to follow for most of the
normal connections and that brace slash
cable cover thing does an amazing job of
providing room to hide the 24 pin SATA
data and this was a happy accident but
on this board right angle USB 3 giving
the rig the appearance of having had a
lot of time spent on cable routing when
really I spent no extra time at all so I
guess that leads us well into the
conclusion for this surprisingly compact
ATX tower well there's no real
innovation here I mean the an tech
Sonata did the whole piano black glossy
finish normal square box at a reasonable
price thing over
ten years ago NZXT executed the concept
incredibly well for less than you'd
expect as always there's a pricing link
in the video description you get a case
that feels reasonably sturdy NZXT
advertises it as 90% metal supports as
much hardware as most gamers and even
enthusiasts are realistically going to
put in their rigs and looks surprisingly
classy even if it's not quite up to the
level you might expect from NZXT tees
promotional videos and images when you
see it in person so for delivering great
value at a low price I'm pleased to
award the NZXT s340 my third stds award
for being something that doesn't suck
looking for a case and this one fits
your budget perfectly you've got my
blessing go ahead and pull the trigger
