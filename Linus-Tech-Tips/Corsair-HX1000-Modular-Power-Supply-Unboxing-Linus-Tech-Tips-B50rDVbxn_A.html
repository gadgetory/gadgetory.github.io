the ever-popular HX 1000 now this is one
of course there's older models of power
supplies but it's been such a staple for
a high-end power supply for a long time
I thought what they hey lots of people
are going to look at this so we might as
well unbox it
so unlike their newer units it has a
five-year warranty which you can see on
the front it's just regular 80 plus
certified because back when this power
supply came out we didn't have the
bronze silver gold ratings for power
supplies although I believe it would
fall somewhere along the lines of where
a 80 plus of gold rating would be if it
were to be recertified today now let's
get this open first of all let's have a
look at the rest of the box so box it
comes in multiple languages here it's
getting the plastic off actually let's
have a quick look at the back where they
show you the amperage of all the
different rails so this has two 12-volt
rails okay and they combined for a total
of oh they're each on separate sort of
virtual rails on the power supply two
separate sort of power supplies inside
here or each 500 watts and of those 12
volts 40 amps is dedicated to the 12
volt rail on each there I finally got
through that nugget so you can see we've
got flat modular cables 140 millimeter
fan truly independent dual transformer
so that's what I was talking about 2 500
watt transformers solid-state 105 degree
capacitors and a DC to DC converter okay
that's great so here we go let's get
this thing open so first of all we're
going to find the users manual which
will contain information excellent then
we find the little case that Corsair
uses with their modular power supply
okay so this stores all of the modular
cables so why don't we go through and
see what we've got here so we've got one
cable that's 2 SATA and then we have
another cable that is also 2 SATA ok and
then we have how many of these let's
just track these down
then we have four PCI Express six plus
two pin for those then going a little
bit further we have okay let's get all
the molex ones out because then I can
get sort of a better idea of what I'm
looking at here okay so we have two dual
molex connectors so each of these have
two molex connectors and then we have to
quadruple molex connectors that also
have a small four pin floppy connector
so two of those and then we've got
finally we have a couple larger SATA
connectors so these each have four SATA
connectors on them so you've got two of
those and then last but not least it's
just in case you have a motherboard such
as the x58 classified from EVGA that
needs to eight pin connectors you can
plug this into one of your PCI Express
modular connectors and get dual EPS
eight pin connectors because and I'm
about to get to the cables that are
actually directly attached to the power
supply you have another EPS 8 pin
connector there so there you go so you
can have up two of those and then you'll
also find two more hard-wired PCI
Express 6+2 connectors because frankly
if you're buying a 1,000 watt power
supply and you're not using a high-end
video card you need to re-examine your
priorities so it's a fairly thin 24 pin
connector and it's sleeved all the way
up to the end and let's find out what
other accessories we got so there we
have some zip ties of course there are
case badge and 4 thumb screws to put the
power supply into the back of your case
you got a nice beefy power cable and
let's finally get the unit itself out of
the box here take off the little o tape
down so that's not kinda quite as easy
to have there we go
take that off so here is the HX 1,000 so
there you can see at the back we've got
a fairly standard honeycomb grille
arrangement there's your on/off switch
there's your power plug and then on the
side you'll see it's an HX 1,000 watt
duh
so there's your branding there then here
is the 140 millimeter fan it's got a
little plastic cover you can take that
off in the Corsair sticker here is
actually quite shiny it looks really
cool if I could get this off in a
reasonable amount of time yeah
it's kind of shiny and then on the other
side we will also find HX 1,000 watts so
this will be right side up whether it's
a top-mounted power supply or a bottom
mounted power supply as long as your
your yeah that's kind of smart actually
okay then here you're finding all of the
specs okay and then on the front of the
unit itself here is all your modular
connectors so you can connect up to six
of your molex or SATA cables and then
you can connect either for more PCI
Express for a total of six or you can
connect three more for a total of five
and one EPS connector as well so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Coursera HX 1,000 watt</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
