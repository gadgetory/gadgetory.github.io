video immersive viewing experiences in
VR is an interesting idea that's why
there's big investment going on like the
NFL working with Google YouTube daydream
VR to bring a miniseries out about what
it takes to train for game day
that along with Fox Sports VR means that
there's a lot of investment going into
viewing traditional sports in VR but
what if you're a gamer and you want to
see stuff like counter-strike and League
of Legends if you're one of those guys
there's slavery TV
it'll be available on mobile 360 Google
cardboard Samsung gear VR
oculus rift HTC five and hopefully soon
Playstations psvr as well sliver gives
you a unique view of the game if you
tune in and install it for the next
counter-strike or League of Legends
tournament that is supported by it
you'll be able to jump into VR look up
and see the official stream of the match
look down is he unique view which is
more closer to the play field
but external to the players view as well
it's pretty interesting that means that
not only are you getting the VR Focus 3d
view down below but if you do want to
check up with the traditional media
every once in a while you can just look
up and it's right there if you want to
check them out just go to whatever App
Store you're supported headset uses and
download the sliver TV app if you want
to check them out on Facebook its sliver
TV and on the Instagram and Twitter it's
sliver TV 360 what they already have is
interesting but what I'm more excited
for is their future more games different
viewing experiences all that kind of
stuff will add a Polish to the platform
that should be good for instance Ed's
lanai competed in a backstage tournament
for a game being worked on by oculus and
insomniac games called the unspoken it's
a wizard game with lots of movement and
tactics and it's in mixed reality
because it's a VR game so you're
actually in the environment as a person
be able to bring someone into that
environment with sliver TV would be a
pretty jaw-dropping experience watching
ed tyll teleport all over the place and
Rec people aim VR with him in the gaming
environment is a very cool use case and
while sliver TV hasn't announced this or
even hinted to it at all I think it
would be a very cool usage of their
platform and it's something that I would
like to see hit them up on Twitter if
you would as well thanks to Intel for
sending us to IEM 2016 in Oakland this
year if you want to see all the rest of
our Linus tech tips content Steve
subscribe to any SEC tips and excuse me
but I'm gonna watch the match now
they have to open the force behind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
