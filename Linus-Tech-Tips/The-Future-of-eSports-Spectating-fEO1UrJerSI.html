video immersive viewing experiences in
VR is an interesting idea that's why
there's big investment going on like the
NFL working with Google YouTube daydream
vr to bring a miniseries out about what
it takes to train for game day that
along with Fox Sports VR means that
there's a lot of investment going into
viewing traditional sports in VR but
what if you're a gamer and you want to
see stuff like counter-strike and League
of Legends if you're one of those guys
there's slaver TV it'll be available on
mobile 360 google cardboard Samsung gear
VR oculus rift HTC vive and hopefully
soon Playstations psv are as well sliver
gives you a unique view of the game if
you tune in and install it for the next
counter-strike your league legends
tournament that is supported by it
you'll be able to jump into VR look up
and see the official stream of the match
look down and see unique you which is
more closer to the play field but
external to the players view as well
it's pretty interesting that means that
not only are you getting the VR focus 3d
view down below but if you do want to
check up with the traditional media
every once in a while you can just look
up and it's right there if you want to
check them out just go to whatever app
store your supported headset uses and
download this sliver TV app if you want
to check them out on facebook it's
sliver TV and on the Instagram and
Twitter its liver TV 360 what they
already have is interesting but what I'm
more excited for is their future more
games different viewing experiences all
that kind of stuff we'll add a Polish to
the platform that should be good for
instance edzel and I competed in a
backstage tournament for a game being
worked on by oculus and insomniac games
called the unspoken it's a wizard game
with lots of movement and tactics and
it's in mixed reality because it's a VR
game so you're actually in the
environment as a person be able to bring
someone into that environment with
sliver TV would be a pretty jaw-dropping
experience watching edzel teleport all
over the place and wreak people NVR with
him in the game
environment is a very cool use case and
while sliver TV hasn't announced this or
even hinted to it at all I think it
would be a very cool usage of their
platform and it's something that I would
like to see hit them up on twitter if
you would as well thanks to Intel for
sending us IEM 2016 and Oakland this
year if you want to see all the rest of
our line executives content same
subscribe to lenny's tech tips and
excuse me but I'm going to watch the
match now here and it's on as strong as
to dig deep a half to open the doors
