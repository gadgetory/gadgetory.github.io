just arrived this is the Isuzu TS mini
Windows Home Server so the specs are
right here you can see it runs an Intel
Atom with one gig of ram it has a 1 500
gig drive but it's available in up to
two terabyte configurations so this is a
Windows Home Server as I just said and
it supports up to two three and a half
inch drives by default so why don't we
start getting this box open and have a
look at it yes mini actually includes
besides the standard Windows Home Server
stuff a couple of unique Estes features
so oh I can't believe I even showed you
this brown box there's actually a full
proper retail box underneath that
actually like looks good and includes
probably more information about it
that's the bottom one actually it
doesn't it includes zero information
about it so you can store share and
secure digital life now I'm a big fan of
Windows Home Server I've been using
Windows Home Server since it was in beta
and I'm gonna sort of cover a few of the
awesome and unique features about it
during this video but there's way way
more it is so customizable you can
really do a ton of different stuff with
Windows Home Server software so the
first thing we find in the box is your
warranty card addressed to dearest
customers we find one ethernet cable a
power adapter as well as a cable for
that and then we have the Windows Home
Server software installation CD so they
actually give you a Windows disk that's
pretty nice or they give you a restore
CD and they also give you a recovery DVD
oh sorry this is the Windows Home Server
installation disc I should know this
this is the PC restore CD so this is one
of the features of Windows Home Server
that is really cool it backs up all your
computers overnight every night and then
what you do is if you have a hard drive
crash completely die in one of your home
PCs you basically just put in a new hard
drive put this disc in your in your DVD
drive and then you run the software off
here it takes all the data off the home
server dumps it onto the new drive and
basically you'd never know that your
computer was out here's a server
recovery DVD this is actually for
recovering the home server to factory
defaults so you can either install
manually or you can restore it to
factory default very cool it includes
some extra hard drive screws so if you
buy your own hard drive
to upgrade the TS me you will have extra
screws here's a Quick Start Guide let's
see what they include their Quick Start
Guide I'm actually curious so they
probably show you you connected to the
Ethernet
you can't run a home server over
wireless so that's one of the things
that they've pointed out right here is
that the home server actually has to be
hardwired directly to your router but
from there it can backup computers that
are connected by wire or by or by
wireless it doesn't really matter so you
start with guest mini now home server is
never intended to be plugged into a
monitor so you actually administer the
home server from the home computer you
use like that custom remote desktop
connection to plug into it and that is
how it's done here they give you quick
instructions on how to install another
hard drive on the back how to set up
user accounts so with the user accounts
you can set you can set up to 10 user
accounts and you can give certain people
access to certain folders you can limit
how much storage can be used by each
user you've got all kinds of great
control you can oh this is cool remote
access you can set whether each user has
the ability to log into the home server
from anywhere in the world sorry my
memory card ran out so you can also
select which users can have full remote
access not only to the home server but
also to any other PC in your house
that's running a remote access capable
OS like Windows XP Pro Windows Vista
Business and up and then Windows 7
Professional end up so that's a very
cool feature you can set up all of your
sharing folders this is another good one
replication so with every folder oh no
this isn't what it's about well either
way replication is a really good feature
with every folder on the Windows Home
Server you can actually set whether it
is going to be replicated or not so ok I
can talk about this more later camera
man's telling me to move faster so a su
special features these we definitely
need to talk about their web-based
management software that allows you to
manage the home server there X store
manager that allows you to easily and
directly backup synchronize manage
folders on an external USB or eSATA
device so not only on the internal
drives as well as their web storage so
they have a free one-year online account
that allows you to backup files from
your home server with your internet
connection and store them on
so there you go let's actually get the
TS movie opened up here and have a look
at that is this device now my home
server is actually just a custom cobbled
together nightmare of machinery it
consumes a ton of power it's really loud
I locked it in a closet but this is
meant to be more like an appliance that
you could actually store somewhere in
your house and have it not look horrible
let's just take the plastic off here so
it's a very sleek looking thing you've
got a nice glossy black finish on the
assist ts mini get all these plastics
off so you've got a bunch of ventilation
up here at the top then you got your
power switch which is pretty much all
you'll ever need because home server
basically runs itself and then I'm just
gonna take off this stuff last piece of
plastic here at the front okay there's
your home server logo you got your
little Windows logo you have activity
LEDs for both of your individual hard
drives here on the front as well as a
network LED indicator this thing is
incredibly shiny I'm gonna have to be
careful not to show the cameraman here I
mean look at this let's do the
obligatory finger shot or you can see
exactly how shiny the side of this thing
is on the back we find a ton of extra
storage inputs so with the TS mini you
can have two internal hard drives and
then you can potentially plug in another
six external hard drives and another to
eSATA hard drives so if you wanted to
have something to either backup
temporarily and then take it away or
something just plugged in permanently
that sits right on top of the TS mini
you've got all those different options
at your disposal next you've got your
Gigabit LAN port as well as your DC
power in and a Kensington lock just in
case you're worried about someone
stealing your home server now the whole
point of Windows Home Server is data
security so open this up it's data
security now what I was about to mention
before when the camera man so rudely
interrupted me was that Windows Home
Server has a replicating feature where
you can set every folder to safely
backup any data on more than one hard
drive so if you've got two hard drives
installed in the home server if you have
one drive installed and one plugged into
the back you can set it so that no
matter what any data that you write to
the home server will be stored on at
least two of those drives at any given
time and it will actually run those
backup checks multiple times daily and
that is how you can make sure that you
do not lose any data even in the event
that your home server suffers a hard
drive failure or some other kind of
catastrophic crash and I can vouch for
this personally because I've actually
had several times I've had drives in my
home server die and I have never once
lost any of the data that I was using
the backup replication software for so I
have got this open now I don't think I'm
gonna go any further here to show you
how to install the hard drive but I
suspect you just kind of remove some of
these screws and it's not too difficult
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the assist ts
mini and I hope that you've enjoyed it
don't forget to subscribe to my video
blog and I hope to be doing a follow up
soon with some of the unique casues
features that come with this particular
home server unit so the cameraman was
complaining I didn't really take any
clothes looks at the home server or
rather not clothes looks we did lots of
clothes looks but we didn't do kind of
an overall view of it so he wanted to
get a closer look at the vents up top
and there are actually there must be
some kind of a fan under here because I
can feel airflow yeah there's two little
fans down here I can feel airflow coming
up from the bottom of the home server
and then you can actually see on the
bottom here there is a ventilation and
then here this is interesting so you've
got the rubber feet here and then you've
got kind of a cutaway so that means that
even if you sit the home server down on
a surface there's still lots of room
here for the air to come in under the
server and then be pulled up through the
top so that you can make sure that your
hard drives as well as your CPU in there
and everything else stays nice and cool
and one thing that I probably didn't
emphasize enough in the first video or
in the first part of this video is that
there is no display there's no display
output the home server is accessed only
by remote desktop connection through the
Ethernet port so thank you for checking
out my video on the assuit TSM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
