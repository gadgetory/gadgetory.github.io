video about their SW 271 monitor which
is marketed as engineered for
photographers and great for video
editing too but what does that mean well
it means it has hardware calibration
support fantastically accurate colors
covering over 99% of the Adobe RGB color
space and it's 4k to boot so then with a
tool like this at our disposal we
thought well hey why don't we take this
opportunity to take a look at how we
have done a less than perfect job of
color correcting some of our own videos
here at LTT while offering you guys
three tips and tricks for taking our
color correction and maybe yours too to
the next level and since I can't tell
pink from periwinkle I've enlisted the
help of our very own director of
photography Brandon Lee
okay hey you go okay okay so taking a
look at our backlog from the last six
months or so I was able to identify
three common let's call them
shortcomings that I think we could
improve on the script is not moving at
all what the heck
number one foreground to background
color exposure balancing this can be
really challenging especially if you're
shooting outdoors like we were in our
recent Asus a imesh video let's
freeze-frame there
we didn't okay job balancing the
exposure here but it could have been
better the image is overexposed overall
but it's particularly bright in the
background compared to Linus so what we
should have done is brought the
background highlights down to make Linus
in the laptop stand out more like this
number two color consistency throughout
the video if your colors are
inconsistent then scene changes are
really jarring and distract the viewer
we were guilty of this on our tech
length announcement video where we
quickly jump from location to location
and each spot had a different dominant
light source in this case the biggest
issue is white balance at the beginning
we start in Linus's office where he's
being lit by a daylight balance aperture
120 d the daylight from the outside is
mostly being stopped by the window
shades and the white balance on the
camera is a little warmer because I
personally think it's a good fit for the
friendly tone of the video but then we
moved to Nick's office where the guys
are being lit by much warmer overhead
lights and the shades are open so we see
blue daylight behind them to keep the
color ideal for this shot I split my
white balance between the cool daylight
and warm overheads otherwise their skin
would look really orange but in a fast
paced shooting environment you have to
make these changes on the fly and
they're not going to be perfect which is
okay as long as you close the gap in
post-production which we didn't do this
time we release a video every day all
right give me a break all right that's
fine because I've done the color
correction now and watching the before
and after you can see that it's a
smoother experience since the scenes
have more unity and finally number three
color grading this is the process of
deliberately altering the colors in the
pursuit of artistic expression rather
than neutrality and realism
but here's the thing in order to do
color grading properly color correction
has to be done first if your starting
point doesn't have consistent and
neutral colors and exposure then color
grading will usually only serve to make
your videos look amateurish our camping
battlestation video is a good example of
a video that is ready for color grading
its nicely balanced but it lacks that
wow factor to take it to the next level
tweaking the green and yellow tones
throughout each shot as well as the
adjustments to the overall contrast make
the video pop just a little bit more we
did actually color great our murderer
box video see how those warm colors
shine through but in my personal opinion
we could have worked in a bit more color
contrast by pushing cooler colors in the
shadows to contrast the warm orange
mid-tones there we go
so that's it Brandon's top 3 tips for
taking your videos our videos to the
next level back to you Linus thanks
Brandon yeah we're really doing the
newscaster bit okay whatever now let's
take a closer look at the SW 271 so
first and foremost it comes with a
shading hood this not only helps cut out
glare but perhaps more importantly makes
your monitor and by extension you look
like a super badass it even comes with
this little door in the top for your
spectrophotometer or your color imager
so you don't need to take the hood off
when you need to calibrate the display
which you can do with the included
pallet master element software that in
our case made the already great out of
the box color accuracy even better
thanks to hardware calibration it
managed Delta e values under one well
under what's perceivable by the human
eye so thank you fourteen bit 3d lookup
table it also comes with this little
puck controls right for the face puck
controller which not only makes the
on-screen display easier to use but also
lets you set shortcuts like switching
between srgb Adobe RGB and advanced
black-and-white modes and it nests
nicely into the stand in this little
nook right here keeping it nice and
clean the stand by the way it's very
sturdy mitigating screen wobble while
still affording a generous amount of
swivel elevation Oh tilt
and even 90 degree pivot although it
should be noted that your shade will not
function quite the way that it does when
you have it in landscape mode this gives
no oh really oh cool
nevermind I stand corrected now in terms
of i/o we've got two HDMI 2.0 s1
DisplayPort 1.4 as well as DisplayPort
over USB type-c which can also deliver
both data and 10 watts of power plus
there's a no rotation required USB hub
with an integrated SD reader that you
can check out here on the side so big
thank you to thank you for sponsoring
this video
big thank you to Brandon for providing
me with some much-needed color
correction tips you guys can check out
the SW 271 photographers monitors as
well as other monitors in this lineup
like the SW 3 20s W 2700 PT + SW 240
which is just 400 bucks at the links
below
there's one for B&amp;amp;H photo and one for
amazon.com where the first 50 people can
get 10% off by using our promo code then
after you buy one you can get a $25 gift
card just for writing a review and if
you have more color correction questions
make sure you leave a post on our forum
where you can chat with a giant
community which includes Believe It or
Not some professionals and enthusiasts
as well as some trolls I'm not gonna
oversell it so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if is awesome get subscribed hit
