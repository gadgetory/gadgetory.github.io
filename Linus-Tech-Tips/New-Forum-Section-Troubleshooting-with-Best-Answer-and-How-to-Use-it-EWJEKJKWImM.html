tech tips forum if you guys haven't
checked it out yet it's Linus tech tips
com and this is a new feature
announcement so slick Frankensteined
this together however it is that he does
the magical things that he does but in
addition to how crazy active and awesome
the forums been in the last few days
since we went from vbulletin to IPS we
are adding new features and
functionality already so there's build
blogs there's general discussion all
these like crazy active sections but
troubleshooting is a new one so slick
went ahead and figured out a way that we
could create a system that's a little
bit like yahoo answers but more focused
on obviously technology so that the top
answer can be can be answered and can be
marked and then that whole thing can be
very very searchable for other people
who are looking for the same answer so
for example if you check out this sticky
post up here at the top that I created
where I say this thread is meant to
demonstrate how the mark solved feature
works you can see that what I do is I go
down to Slick's post to telling me this
is an example of solved I can mark this
as solved market is the best answer and
what that'll do forever is it will
highlight that limb within your thread
and put a shortcut to it at the top of
the thread with a link so that the whole
post can be viewed simply by clicking it
this is a great way to help other people
who might have the same problem as you
at find the answer much more quickly so
guys I issue you a challenge if you
haven't already created an account and
joined the forum community try it make a
thread just talk about something to talk
about tech and I can pretty much
guarantee you that you will get a reply
within an hour it is amazing how active
the community here is here and how great
everyone is and how hard everyone's
trying to just you know be the most
helpful awesome member of this brand new
community so it's been fantastic I mean
especially the mods I want to give a
huge shout out to those guys and of
course it wouldn't even be possible at
all without slicks hard work making all
of this well work so thanks for checking
out this I was about to say unboxing
Getty shirt unboxing video of the new
forum look there's a box and wrapped it
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
