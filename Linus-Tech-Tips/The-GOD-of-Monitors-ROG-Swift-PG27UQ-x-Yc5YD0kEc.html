you by Squarespace now we've got them
linked in the video description you know
what they do so this is it monitor
monitor evolution has ended because I
don't really understand how it gets a
whole lot better than what I have in
front of me today this is the rog swift
PG 27 uq and it would be a lot easier
for me to come up with a list of crazy
amazing features that it doesn't have so
4k resolution 3840 by 2160 HDR and i
will get a little bit more into that
later g-sync
so that means if you're running an
Nvidia graphics card you've got support
for variable refresh rate technology and
it runs at a hundred forty-four Hertz
well how are they doing that what the
what the crap is going on here so I so I
pulled the plate off the back and it's
running on a single cable so the only
thing that I've seen is it's got on the
spec sheet here it's got HDMI but come
on realistically this is an HDMI 2.1
they just finalized the spec like
yesterday something like that so it's
DisplayPort 1.4 it's got two inputs and
I assumed it would be using two of them
but then I thought wait a minute I just
saw the Dell 8k monitor that was running
off of you guessed it - DisplayPort 1.3
so they've got this all closed in here
see this my friends a soos won't tell me
what's here but fortunately I have two
hands I got two hands I know how this
works okay well I can't tell exactly
what they are but if I had to guess if I
had to guess I would say that it's one
of the only graphics cards on the market
that has support for anything higher
than DisplayPort 1.2 so is probably if I
had to guess Quadro p6000 SLI nobody
nobody's giving me any confirmation
whatsoever okay I'm not going to stress
about that too much the point is this
thing's coming in sometime and by that
time hopefully there will be a system
that can run it all right
more details though I said before HDR
but the industry has kind of decided
that HDR means anything about
of SDR when it comes to a consumer-grade
monitor asus not good enough for them as
a gaming display but they're like ya
know we're going to do it properly so
we've got 384 zones of fully fully
backlit array backlit LCD goodness which
is allowing them to achieve 1000 nits
peak brightness meaning that this
display with HDR 10 support is not only
a gaming display it is also potentially
and I don't know much about the color
space coverage what do we got here you
guys talking about that looks like not a
whole lot but it's quantum dot so I'm
assuming we're doing better than Adobe
RGB anyway there's nothing that would
prevent this thing from being used for
content creation what can't it do yeah
the answer is pretty much nothing but
just in case you don't like the gamer
aesthetic well hey they've got the PA 30
to you this puppy looks like it's built
on a pretty darn similar platform so the
same 384 direct zone direct LED
backlight 1000 nits peak brightness HDR
support all that good stuff but on this
one they are actually calling out 85
percent of rec 2020 coverage 99.5% of
Adobe RGB 95% of dcpip 3 and 100% srgb
support so this looks like it could be a
candidate for us to move to an HDR
workflow wink-wink sometime in the
future assuming that you know they can
get it produced sometime in the in the
next little bit here so how much is one
of these gonna cost you I don't know
lots let's say $1,500 maybe more but
they're super cool so thanks for
checking out this video guys don't
forget to subscribe so you don't miss
any of our I was doing the light collet
with the thumb and I was doing the
subscribe with the mouth don't worry too
much about it a huge that it's foul
