graphics cards are like a bra for your
graphics card they look sexy and
alluring making the reveal of what's
underneath that much more fun and the
sag prevention is a bonus but do they
help with cooling I mean you can find
people asking about this everywhere from
the line of tech tips for them to
overclock dotnet to Tom's Hardware to
EVGA zone forums reddit and even super
user forums they're all asking the same
question and the answer has always been
nope no cooling benefits just aesthetics
and rigidity though you'll find the odd
mention of protection for the components
on the back from things like drop screws
abrasion or small water cooling mishaps
which is valid but not cooling right
well that's what I thought but Oris
recently released their gtx 1080 extreme
edition 8g a beastly looking card with
an advanced copper backplate cooling
they claimed that excess heat from your
GPU not only gets dissipated by the
massive cooling module on the front you
know the standard graphics card heatsink
biele but also through the backside with
a ribbed copper plate providing a
well-rounded thermal solution for the
GPU
well they piqued my interest but they
don't say exactly by how much the
advanced copper backplate cooling
solution will actually reduce temps by
there is this giant egg Row 3 that's
just chilling on the graphic of the
backplate so I guess we're going to go
with that welcome to episode 1 of
manufacturers say where we're going to
test if or as's new solution can stand
up to their bold claims
geez people is hosting a buy one get one
free promotion for their energy drink
tubs check it out at the link below
let's set the playing field this is a
non reference NVIDIA GTX 1080 but we'll
start with a Founders Edition 1080 it
also has a backplate but doesn't claim
that it improves cooling and there's no
shiny copper on it just a few weeks off
thermal pads that are probably there
mostly to make sure that the back plate
isn't detrimental to cooling I threw it
on a test bench and loaded up fur mark
the fuzzy doughnut of death I left the
card at stock settings other than
cranking the temp target up to 83
degrees and after letting it burn for
about 20 minutes just to be sure it was
out of stable 79 degrees Celsius all
right time to take it back
off the bench and remove the backplate
this is a relatively simple process four
screws around the GPU two bigger ones
near the i/o and then there's a ton of
tiny little incredibly annoying screws
everywhere ah be sure to have a
magnetics parts tray if you don't have
one we have this handy guide on how to
make one out of a dead hard drive
because these little devils will run
away on you god they're annoying
anyways bench time again the fuzzy donut
is back and the results 79 degrees no
change whatsoever this is starting to
feel like the workshop we even took some
shots with our Fleur thermal camera to
give you guys a more complete picture of
what's going on but in a nutshell the
founders edition card
well the backplate didn't really help
anything what a challenger approaches
aggressive angles animalistic symbols
refined copper metal and industrial
styling same process plot it in lock it
in place screwed and cranked the thermal
and power limit to max overclocked the
core and memory by a hundred megahertz
each apply the fuzzy donut and wait 20
minutes results 67 degrees and that's at
over two gigahertz on the core this is a
pretty wicked card it's fast it runs
cool
I hit a voltage limit at that overclock
but
yeah I'm liking it so far but how about
that back plate well looking at the
floor thermal imaging there is a cold
spot right where that back plate sits
but does that translate to a difference
in core temperatures time to find out
remove the three random screws from the
back plate then the four ones around the
GPU realize that there are more
internally remove the entire heatsink
unplugging all four plugs from the
inside and undoing two remaining screws
find another power connector behind the
back plate for the glowing orit's logo
try not to break the connector when
removing it as it's rather fragile
attach the cooler again but leave the
backplate off put it back on the bench
and conclusions 67 degrees that's the
result 67 degrees is not lower than 67°
67° is the same damn thing as 67
degrees these results are not different
the FLIR footage doesn't show the cold
spot anymore but as there was no
improvement the core is not less hot the
card is not running any faster does the
back plate look really cool yep does it
cool things maybe maybe the back of the
PCB but not the GPU or anything else
that is going to affect performance it's
hard with the tools that we have to say
whether this is to do with poor thermal
transfer through the PCB or the thick
thermal pad that's on the copper plate
and the card does perform well so we
aren't saying not to buy it or anything
just brace yourself for disappointment
if you're a hardcore copper backplates
for their GPU cooling abilities nerds
and I guess it's that exists thanks for
watching guys does this video suck you
know to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit the like button and
considered going down below to click on
links to buy stuff or buying a shirt
which is the same as buying stuff but
the stuff could reference graphics cards
you saw in this video so that's slightly
more specific than what I said right
before that also watch this video which
is our video
on my personal break there we go
that video is not up yet but
theoretically considering it's like
almost done editing it will go up before
this goes up so I'll be that work though
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
