the PB 278 LCD monitor from a soos I am
as you guys probably know if you watch
my videos at all big into high
resolution displays I care a lot more
about high resolution than I do about
things like for example high refresh
rates which is also cool and we have a
Seuss's 144 Hertz monitor right there
but for me I love having more real
estate on my screen and I like not
seeing as many distracting you know
large pixels that to me take away from
the the crispness of the image so yes
big into high resolution displays this
is a 27-inch monitor that runs at a
whopping 2560 by 1440 sixteen by nine
resolution it is also part of a Seuss's
pro art series which means that we can
expect outstanding color reproduction
and just an overall just awesome
aesthetic for the monitor itself very
professional-looking so we've seen these
monitors before a couple times in fact
we even have one here in the tech tip
studio that we use for our HDMI monitor
on our camera so there you go yes we
actually believe in the pro art and I'm
just going to take this out this this is
this is bigger than the one that we have
so I'm going to go ahead and set this up
and then we'll talk a little bit more
about it now in terms of included
accessories this is a premium product
and they treat it like one which is nice
to see so you've got an audio cable it
does have built-in three watt speakers
and a soos way to go on this one because
everyone else when they build speakers
into there you know otherwise
gorgeous-looking monitor they've only
put like these big league bars on the
side of it that are just horrible it
looks like he Sue's has
completely hidden the speaker grills
which is fine with me because it might
affect it might adversely affect the
audio quality but who cares because you
know you're not going to use it unless
it's in a pinch anyway so thumbs up way
to go ace oohs good job um
moving right along we've got a display
port cable HDMI cable a power cable a
VGA cable and a dual link DVI cable
however the only connectors that I would
recommend using on this monitor our DVI
and DisplayPort because it exceeds the
maximum bandwidth of most HDMI output so
there's newfangled ones with faster
processors that are a little bit
different but in order to get that 2560
by 1440 60 Hertz output you're gonna
want to use a proper digital connector
no VGA at all okay let's have a look at
the physical apps oh this this this
visit door okay so you know how normally
when you have like a square monitor base
like this they you know it's not really
you can't really uh pivot the whole
thing check this out they put a rotating
circle part under the bottom of it so
that you can like it this isn't actually
the stand it's just kind of there see
awesome right it's got cable management
at the back so you just go ahead and
throw this thing on here so this allows
you to take this off rub your cables
down where they need to go and then you
just go ahead and pop this into place
however it pops in place there we go and
you can use that to make sure that
everything's nice and tidy runs right
down the back of the monitor so you
don't have wires hanging down here so
again for a nice nice aesthetic you've
got a Kensington lock here on the back
and all your inputs and outputs are
going to be rotated this way a little
bit more before I do this and show them
to you so yes this monitor does have
full pivot power in DisplayPort in VGA
and DVI in HDMI IN and audio in and out
so you can use it as a pass-through for
your headphones as well on screen
display is done via hardware buttons
personally I still prefer this approach
although there's one monitor the BenQ 24
20 t that I don't mind the soft buttons
so that's the one exception other than
that prefer this approach there's one
cool button here see if I can find it
the quick
button right there that's really neat
because what it does is it actually
overlays over the entire screen a grid a
variety of different grids of different
sizes with metric and imperial that
allow you to easily line up anything
you're going to print or anything you're
going to use otherwise outside of the
computer and and size it up to make sure
that what you're looking at here is what
you're actually going to end up with
it's just kind of neat one of our
graphics designers is using a couple pro
arts as well and he's actually used it a
couple times for for print media uh what
else is there to say about oh yes I
haven't even gotten to this yet so it
has an 80 million to one high contrast
ratio I mean that might be optimistic
but the point is with its wide viewing
angle and um outstanding okay hold on
you know what we're just gonna back up
hmmm
100% of the sRGB color space is covered
by this monitor it has a very wide
viewing angle 178 degrees and 178
degrees and these who's claims an eighty
million to one contrast ratio this is
all backed up by the fact that this is
using a pls panel so that is a basically
it's a proprietary special version of
IPS that I personally just love every
time I see and use a pls panel I'm
struck again by how outstanding the
colors are how vibrant it is how great
the viewing angles are the Galaxy Tab
10.1 is still my favorite tablet just
because of that awesome
pls panel on it so I'm really happy to
see Asus implementing that technology on
this particular monitor right we haven't
even shown the full range of movement so
here I'm going to get you guys to look
at from the side so there's your tilt
okay there's your swivel which is done
from the base and then of course your
pivot in case you wanted to use it in my
portrait mode because you are like you
know like a dude who's made out of a
monitor or something like that it does
have a base amount so if you did want to
mount it on a separate mounting stand or
whatever else the case may be just go
ahead and pull those four guys right
there out and I think that pretty much
covers it thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the PB 278
from Asus don't forget to subscribe to
latest tech tips from unboxings reviews
and
computer videos and I should clarify
something I've referred to this and the
pro art family of monitors sort of a few
times here but the pro it is separate
that's the PA series this is the PB
series which is not quite a pro art but
is also looking pretty outstanding from
my perspective one other thing I should
have mentioned is it does have a matte
screen it's sort of semi matte so it
doesn't quite have that same scatter
effect that you see with super matte
screens but you're not really going to
see I mean you can plainly see there's
not a whole lot of reflection coming off
it sous does have their zero bright dot
policy covering this monitor so one year
of zero bright dots and a three year
warranty for the panel overall don't

from unboxings reviews and other
