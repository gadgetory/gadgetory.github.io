check the link in the video description
for more details this is the grid from
NZXT and it's either going to be the
most completely friggin irrelevant thing
in the world to you or it'll pretty much
save your bacon at some point what it is
is it is a way to add an NZXT feature
that they already put on some of their
cases such as their higher-end phantoms
as well as their switch 810 and add it
to pretty much any case so em yeah yeah
phantom 630 and switch 810 glob blah
blah capable of etcetera white LED
indicator lights and includes an
extension cables this is it it comes
with an instruction guide which is
pretty straightforward if you need
instructions to operate this sort of
thing then we'll do an unboxing on how
to tie your shoes later which I know
I've made that joke before but I still
think it's funny and what it is is it is
a fan splitter so basically you run
power to it this way by running one
molex connector to a single input here
unfortunately it's three pin only and
doesn't have an extra dummy slot for a
four pin fan which I would love to see
in a sort of second generation grid grid
2 if you will and splits it out into 10
fans which I personally think is awesome
it obviously won't allow you to monitor
rpm in any meaningful way but what it
does do is it allows you to at least
power the bloody things and let's face
it if you have need for a splitter for
10 fans you're probably not too worried
about one fan failing taking down your
entire system any who in terms of
accessories they include some
double-sided 3m tape in order oh no look
at that double-sided 3m velcro it's not
velcro its dual lock ha oh that's cool
looks like it doesn't wear out like
velcro it's just little like plastic
nubbins that interlock with each other
anyway sorry I should be focused on the
grid alright it also includes three fan
extension cables and by three I mean
three yes good three and these do
include a couple of adapters so you can
plug a four pin
fan into the 3-pin grid using these
extension splash adapters and then one
of them is just two straight three pin 2
3 pin extension and that is pretty much
it
zip ties okay guys if you know you need
it then you know you need it and it's
relatively inexpensive which is really
cool it's also nice and small so you can
just like hide it somewhere here's my
trademark cell phone size comparison
although my cell phone has a case on it
so it tells you nothing ah don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos like the video if you liked it or
dislike it if you disliked it I actually
don't care one way or the other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
