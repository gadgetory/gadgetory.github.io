feel this way like every time you
upgrade your computer you're saving 32
cents on your power bill this month and
not getting better performance in games
creative applications or even just
general usage well the thing about
feelings is that they're difficult to
quantify so we gathered up every top
Intel CPU from the last 10 years and put
together an epic comparison for you
performance power consumption thermals
and price is innovation dead is it more
than a feeling death detector
gee fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage that helps you maintain
focus and endurance over long days and
gaming sessions use our code at the link
below let's start with our testing
methodology we used the same video card
on every platform even though the GTX
1080 wasn't even a twinkle in Jensen's
eye when the Pentium Extreme Edition
9:55 was the king of the hill we did
this because we wanted the main variable
to be CPU performance rather than
allowing this to turn into a comparison
of the best overall systems through the
years with that said DDR memory has gone
all the way from 667 megahertz dual
channel to over 2000 megahertz quad
channel so our compromise there was to
use a high end RAM and motherboard
combination that would have been typical
at the time we went ten years back and
for every year picked out the first
extreme edition Intel CPU then for each
one we performed the following tests
temperature under load overall system
power consumption in our skybox stare
test and we put it through a suite of
modern CPU and gaming benchmarks though
since this project already had me
tunneling into the dark recesses of my
past I was unable to resist benchmarking
each CPU on half-life 2 as well using
such old hardware presented a few
challenges not least of which was we had
to use Windows 7 on all of our builds to
ensure driver and game support CPU mark
was the first test and the results were
very boring since they were just numbers
on a spreadsheet but then I had John
turned it into a graph ah much better
while the multi-threaded results that
use all of the CPU scores show
incremental performance improvements the
hidden story here is the single threaded
results where we see Intel's current 10
core flagship the 6950 X getting
outperformed by chips going
all the way back to 2011 in why cruncher
a benchmark that calculates 50 million
digits of pi we tested in multi-threaded
mode which gave us similar results to
CPU mark incremental improvements
Cinebench proved to be interesting as I
initially expected the results would
mimic CPU mark but I was pleasantly
surprised the 69 50 X sat at the top as
king in both multi-threading and single
core tests with the oldest chip a
Pentium on the bottom lucky dog
on to our first real-world benchmark
Adobe Media encoder again shows the
older x79 chips with their higher single
core clock speeds beating the 69 50x in
the more commonly used GPU accelerated
rendering method a video where we went
more into this and why it happens can be
found here each of the game benchmarks
seems to tell the same old story of
incremental performance bumps
rise of the Tomb Raider our modern game
engine representative managed to scale
through all generations only slowing
down when going from 8 to 10 cores
Crysis 3 representing an older triple-a
engine improved very little past the i7
965 as it is not a very multi-threaded
title and then there was half-life 2
whose numbers don't show us much other
than boring old incremental bumps but
here are the results for a nostalgia
purposes so yes for the most part each
chip performed better than its
predecessor but the margin of
improvement from chip to chip shows a
steady downward trend though I'm sure
for some of you this didn't come as much
of a surprise Intel has publicly stated
their Rd is less focused on huge
increases in processing power for
consumer pcs because they want to direct
their attention to mobile data centers
Internet of Things devices and the cloud
so then CPU power draw and heat output
which are very important to those
markets
that's way down on newer products right
only sort of at idle power saving
features have improved this dramatically
but when working hard on the high end at
least Intel has settled into a thermal
and power budget they're comfortable
with and they seem to be just adding
more cores accordingly so efficiency is
up that is performance per watt but your
power draw while gaming will likely
remain mostly unchanged let's look at
pricing trends now for an entire decade
a thousand US dollars give or take would
get you the pinnacle of Intel consumer
engineering not so anymore they're
asking a whopping seventeen hundred
dollars for their flagship enthusiast
product so conclusion time then
decreasing performance games and
increasing prices the rational human and
me might point at the collapse of
Moore's law caused by the cost and
difficulty of continuing to shrink
silicon transistors and Intel's design
goals that have shifted to address
growing markets rather than shrinking
ones to explain this but the conspiracy
theorist and me noticed three things one
after 2011 we stopped seeing large
single core performance bumps from
extreme edition chips and after 2013 we
stopped seeing tangible single core
improvements in consumer chips at all -
the last time AMD had a CPU in
competition with Intel for the high-end
market was in 2008 and three perhaps
most incriminating ly the Intel logo
looks suspiciously like the eye of a
reptile turned on its side
it's time for another razor giveaway and
today it's all about the Kraken pro and
7.1 V two headsets from Razer both
models include 50 millimeter drivers
lightweight frames a headband designed
for better weight distribution and less
clamping force larger interchangeable
ear cushions that are softer and have
better sound isolation fully retractable
unidirectional microphones and the 7.1
features 7.1 virtual surround sound over
its USB connection it's got active
noise-cancelling and Razer chroma
lighting as well we're giving away five
of the pros as well as one 7.1 as part
of a six gaming bundle giveaway from
Razer enter through the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked do you know
what to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or even
consider checking out our affiliate code
links to where to buy CPUs at Amazon in
the video description you can also buy a
cool shirt like this one from our merch
store or join our forum which is
freaking awesome all that is linked down
below now that you're done doing all
that stuff you're probably wondering
what to watch next so click that little
button in the top right corner to check
out our latest through the ages or not
latest this is the latest the previous
one where we looked at CPU water blocks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
