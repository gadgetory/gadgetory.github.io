an unboxing in the camera man's office
as you can see it's kind of gone to ruin
in the time that I haven't been here to
to help him clear space from time to
time got a little game controllers not
that the cameraman has any idea how to
play games being a Mac guy all that okay
camera man we're doing some cleanup he's
got his precious Bunny all over the
place some wonder he has any money he
spent so much on making sure that he has
a Mac instead of getting a PC which is a
better value mmm
okay so today we have something totally
unrelated to Mac or PC this is actually
an Android tablet this is the crues
tablet from velocity micro and it looks
pretty cool so first things first we got
a sticker on the front Kindle for
Android so you can read more than
725,000 Kindle books with free
applications with the free applications
on the cruise tablet if you are a non-us
customer book availability may vary so
that might be relevant to me given I am
here in the great white north of canada
alright let's see what they had to say
for themselves on the box so you can
view your cruise tablet at the right
angle with the cruise stand so there's a
stand dimensions you got the compatible
products there's a little stand okay I
don't know that it comes with that I
guess we'll find out here on the back
little something all the applications
you need in the palm of your head and
here's our specs so it has a 7 inch slim
TFT so that basically just means LCD
screen 800 by 600 capacitive touch it is
a 4 to 3 aspect ratio so that's
interesting this is not widescreen it
runs on Android 2.0 has a browser ok 256
Meg's of RAM 4 gigs a built-in storage
with a four gig external sd card but you
can't expand that it comes with Wi-Fi it
has a G sensor battery is up to 6 hours
of watching video we've got dimensions
here but we're gonna pull it out and
show you guys later it has support for
SDHC so you can support up to I believe
it's 32 gigs on SDHC video playback is
here reader files stand all the stand is
included there you go here's all a few
different things that you can do to surf
the web use the online bookstore you can
access your social media really it's app
driven much like
any Android device you can watch videos
view documents it has a dictionary I
don't know why we would necessarily call
it the dictionary but whatever manage
your files and has a g-sensor so it will
automatically rotate from portrait to
landscape more features here which we've
pretty much covered most of those also
includes an alarm clock apparently a
calculator I mean it better including a
calculator and you know this kind of a
price point and this advanced a device
okay so packaging wise here we go we
have a white box which has more of a
white box on the inside there's the
tablet itself I'm not gonna show you
that just yet here is a nice little okay
there's our included four gig SanDisk
SDHC card here is a little sleeve which
includes some information about the
warranty so there's our SD card here's a
limited warranty okay something about
one year okay so it has a one-year
warranty
next we've got a Quick Start Guide why
don't we have a look at that after we
turn it on and then we have a little
little sort of foamy sleeve for it so
that's pretty nice actually alright
here's the little cruise stand so you
can use it up the correct angle alright
and then we have a charger so that's it
fairly simple accessory package let's
have a look at the crews tablet itself
it's got a little bit of a heft to it
but it's more of a it's more of a feel
solid weight than a feels heavy weight
kind of like the iPhone 4 like the
iPhone 4 it's heavy but it's just heavy
because it's like feels solidly built so
I'm gonna go ahead and try and find the
power button which is here so let's not
let's wait for it to power on while we
show you guys all the other buttons so
we've got reset check it out USB that's
something your iPhone doesn't have okay
there's our SD slot so that's your
expandable storage up to 32 gigs on this
side we've got volume controls up and
down we've got a little bit of cruise
branding going on there moving along to
the bottom we've got a headphone jack
some kind of indicator LED we have
speakers which are built right into the
bottom here as well as our power in and
then
the other side nothing so it's got a
fairly clean overall look to the outside
of it
on the back you just see a little
Velocity Micro logo Cruz tablet you got
your serial number as well as some FCC
you know it complies with part whatever
or whatever here we've got Android
booting up now and why don't we wait for
it to boot up and then we'll be back and
yeah it's not quite booted up yet so
let's boot it up camera man's gesturing
to me so I guess we better do that oh
look there we go so the screen is right
away nice and vibrant I'm gonna see if I
can find some I think here is settings
yep so let's play around with some of
these stuff so we've got Wireless and
networks works pretty much like any
other Android device so we've got our
navigation up here move it down a little
bit there we go let's see I want screen
is a big one for me so let's see what
the display is gonna look like if we
tinker around with a little bit some
brightness it's out it's maximum
brightness right now it goes all the way
down to here so I'd say sort of a happy
medium is probably right there around 35
to 40% that's where I usually end up
when I'm using any of these kinds of
devices though this one seems to have a
full charge on it right now we can show
animations cool so does that yeah there
we go so now the now the screens are
going to be animating ah you know what
give me a second to get connected to the
Wi-Fi and then we'll go a little further
into this so here we go we got the
Android app store installed it actually
didn't come with that pre-installed on
the tablet which is a very strange thing
to me but here it is so I just
downloaded Angry Birds connecting to the
Wi-Fi only took me a couple minutes
which is pretty cool just had to enter
the password for the Wi-Fi here at the
office using the app store is pretty
much like using the app store on my
friend's phone back when I was deciding
whether to get here let me see where's
like here what I mean see if there's
like a Facebook app or something back
when I was deciding whether to get the
Galaxy S vibrant or the iPhone 4
although the cameraman did bring my
attention to the fact that Android 2.0
what this guy's running is not really
that similar to the to the Android that
is running on the phones that are out
there right now it's slightly more
up-to-date so this is what there is for
facebook why don't we just have a look
and see if our Angry Birds is done not
just yet
so let's set you know okay I have to
criticize a couple things it's not as
fast as I would ideally like it's not
quite as the screens not quite as bright
as I would ideally like but it's got a
lot going for it and that is that the
price is really low so this thing is
less than two hundred and fifty bucks at
retail it does have the agreement in
place with Amazon where you can use it
as a kindle e-book reader so that makes
it it puts it down in that ebook price
point where it becomes very a very good
value proposition and you don't really
need the speed for those kinds of
applications so here you can just sign
in with your Amazon credentials okay so
why don't we go ahead and check out
Angry Birds here see how well that runs
on this little tablet of course that's
what I would care about right do I wanna
install this application yep okay we'll
come back once it's installed okay we
weren't able to install Angry Birds what
I've discovered is that that app store
is not actually like the Android Market
that I'm familiar with so it doesn't
have some of the same good stuff in it
we did find a YouTube app though in the
in the cruise app store and there's also
a Facebook one in there so let's see how
well the YouTube one works I'm just
running one of my own YouTube videos
this is a 720p video hmm okay let's see
if there's a way to run this in higher
quality I'll be back in a minute so we
were watching it in horrible quality why
don't we watch in normal quality that
might help a little bit
say a little bit I don't really see
anywhere to adjust the volume hold on
okay details comments oh I can rate my
video yes okay well I think that they're
probably focusing on the correct
marketing points on the box when they
emphasize it as like a Kindle reader
because with the overall build of it
feeling very solid very nice and the the
screen being quite adequate I think that
it would make for like a great ebook
reader and since there you can access
the internet on it and we'll show you
the browsing speed in just a moment here
here let's try this one more time
watching normal quality let's see if it
gets any better
it's probably buffering right now
okay let's show you guys the browser so
we're gonna go to NCI XCOM okay press
home okay we got a browser doo doo and C
I hex com let's go there
oops okay let's try that again
NCI XCOM go let's try that Go button
that might work better so here's where
we downloaded the YouTube view 1.3
because you can see it's not a huge it's
not like an android youtube app it's
like specifically for the cruise reader
so I think they probably still got some
work to do as far as the app development
goes and once once those mature a little
bit once the installed base of these
devices gets a little bit wider than I
think we'll see some definite
improvements in the overall and the
overall responsiveness of the apps here
we go so we're loading up the NCIX site
oh you can double tap to zoom in and
zoom out so that's kind of neat I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna check out
the forums
you can see we've got st. Patrick's
deals going on on NCI XCOM right now
so we've moved significantly closer to
our access point and we're actually
having a little bit more success with
the browsing speed okay so let's go to
you know the main form home
so basically I think the conclusion at
this point is that as an e-reader or for
checking email actually this is pretty
unbeatable for the price but I wouldn't
expect to be doing any heavy lifting
let's see if we can get it to brows a
little bit faster now because I did have
some success of a faster browsing so
here we go now we can navigate so I'm
quite close to my access point from here
and that's giving me some more success
although it's still not fast by any
stretch of the imagination for mobile
browsing but I mean it's more than
adequate for like email or whatever the
case may be so thank you for checking
