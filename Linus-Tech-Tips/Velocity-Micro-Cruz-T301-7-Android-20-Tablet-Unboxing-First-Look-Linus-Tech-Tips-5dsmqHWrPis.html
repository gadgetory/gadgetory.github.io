an unboxing in the camera man's office
as you can see it's kind of gone to ruin
in the time that I haven't been here to
help him Oh clear space from time to
time got old game controllers not that
the cameraman has any idea how to play
game being a mac guy all that okay
cameraman we're doing some cleanup he's
got his precious bunny all over the
place some wonder he has any money spend
so much on making sure that he has a mac
instead of getting a PC which is a
better value mm okay so today we have
something totally unrelated to mac or pc
this is actually an Android tablet this
is the cruise tablet from velocity micro
and it looks pretty cool so first things
first we got a sticker on the front
kindle for android so you can read more
than seven hundred and twenty-five
thousand kindle books with free
applications with the free applications
on the cruise tablet if you are a non-us
customer book availability may vary so
that might be relevant to me given i am
here in the great white north of canada
alright let's see what they have to say
for themselves on the box so you can
view your cruise tablet at the right
angle with the crews stand so there's a
stand dimensions you got the compatible
products there's a little stand okay i
don't know that it comes with that i
guess we'll find out here on the back
little sin thing all the applications
you need in the palm of your hand and
here's our specs so it has a 7-inch a
slim TFT so that basically just means
LCD screen 800 x 600 capacitive touch it
is a 423 aspect ratio so that's
interesting this is not widescreen it
runs on android 2.0 has a browser okay
256 megs of ram four gigs a built-in
storage with a four gig external SD card
but you can expand that it comes with
Wi-Fi it has a g-sensor battery is up to
six hours of watching video we've got
dimensions here but we're gonna pull it
out and show you guys later it has
support for sdhc so you can support up
to i believe it's 32 gigs on sdhc video
playback is here reader files stand all
the stand is included there you go
here's all a few different things that
you can do surf the web use the online
bookstore you can access your social
media really its app driven much like
any Android device you can watch videos
view documents it has a dictionary I
don't know why we would necessarily call
it the dictionary but whatever manage
your files and it has a g-sensor so it
will automatically rotate from portrait
to landscape more features here which
we've pretty much covered most of those
also includes an alarm clock apparently
a calculator I mean it better including
a calculator and you know this kind of a
price point and this advanced the device
okay so packaging wise here we go we
have a white box which has more of a
white box on the inside there's the
tablet itself not going to show you that
just yet here is a nice little okay
there's our included four gig sandisk
sdhc card here is a little sleeve which
includes some information about the
warranty so there's our SD card here's a
limited warranty okay something about
one year ok so it has a one year
warranty next we've got a quick start
guide why don't we have a look at that
after we turn it on and then we have a
little little sort of foamy sleeve for
it so that's pretty nice actually
alright here's the little cruise stand
so you can use it up the correct angle
alright and then we have a charger so
that's it fairly simple accessory
package let's have a look at the cruise
tablet itself it's got a little bit of a
hectic but it's more of a it's more of a
feel solid weight than a feels heavy
weight kind of like the iphone 4 like
the iphone 4 is heavy but it's just
heavy because it's like feels solidly
built so i'm going to go ahead and try
and find the power button which is here
so let's not let's wait for it to power
on while we show you guys all the other
buttons so we've got reset check it out
USB that's something your iphone doesn't
have okay there's our SD slot so that's
your expandable storage up to 32 gigs on
this side we've got volume controls up
and down we've got a little bit of
cruise Brendan going on there moving
along to the bottom we've got a
headphone jack some kind of indicator
LED we have speakers which are built
right into the bottom here as well as
our power in and then
the other side nothing so it's got a
fairly clean overall look to the outside
of it on the back you just see a little
velocity micro logo cruz tablet you got
your serial number as well as some FCC
you know it complies with part whatever
or whatever here we've got android
booting up now and why don't we wait for
it to boot up and then we'll be back and
yeah it's not quite booted up yet now
let's boot it up camera man's gesturing
to me so i guess we'd better do that oh
look there we go so the screen is right
away nice and vibrant i'm gonna see if i
can find some thing here is settings yep
so let's play around with some of the
stuff so we've got our wireless and
networks works pretty much like any
other android device so we've got our
navigation up here move it down a little
bit there we go oh let's see i want
screen is a big one for me so let's see
what the display is going to look like
if we tinker around with a little bit
some brightness it's at its maximum
brightness right now it goes all the way
down to here so i'd say sort of a happy
medium is probably right there around
thirty five to forty percent that's
where i usually end up when i'm using
any of these kinds of devices though
this one seems to have a full charge on
it right now we can show animations cool
so yeah there we go so now the now the
screens are going to be animating ah you
know what give me a second to get
connected to the Wi-Fi and then we'll go
a little further into this so here we go
we got the android app store installed
it actually didn't come with that
pre-installed on the tablet which is a
very strange thing to me but here it is
so i just downloaded angry birds
connecting to the Wi-Fi only took me a
couple minutes which is pretty cool just
had to enter the password for the Wi-Fi
here at the office using the app store
is pretty much like using the app store
on my friends phone back when I was
deciding whether to get here let me see
where's like hear what I'm going to see
if there's like a facebook app or
something back when I was deciding
whether to get the galaxy s vibrant or
the iphone 4
although the cameraman did bring my
attention to the fact that Android to
point out what this guy's running is not
really that similar to the to the
Android that is running on the phones
that are out there right now it's
slightly more up-to-date so this is what
there is for facebook why don't we just
have a look and see if our angry birds
is done not just yet so let's sup you
know ok I have to criticize a couple
things it's not as fast as I would
ideally like um it's not quite as the
screens not quite as bright as I would
ideally like but it's got a lot going
for it and that is that the price is
really love so this thing is less than
250 bucks at retail it does have the
agreement in place with Amazon where you
can use it as a kindle e-book reader so
that makes it it puts it down in that
ebook price point where it becomes very
a very good value proposition and you
don't really need the speed for those
kinds of applications so here you can
just sign in with your Amazon on
credentials ok so why don't we go ahead
and check out angry birds here see how
well that runs on this little tablet of
course that's what I would care about
right do I want install this application
yep ok we'll come back once its
installed ok we weren't able to install
Angry Birds what i've discovered is that
that app store is not actually like the
android market that i'm familiar with so
it doesn't have some of the same good
stuff in it we did find a youtube app
though in the in the cruise app store
and there's also a facebook one in there
so let's see how well the youtube one
works i'm just running one of my own
youtube videos this is a 720p video hmm
ok let's see if there's a way to run
this in higher quality I'll be back in a
minute so we were watching it in
horrible quality why don't we watch in
normal quality that might help a little
bit
high-end and I mean very high-end a
little bit I don't really see anywhere
to adjust the volume hold on okay
details comments oh I can rate my video
yes okay well I think that they're
probably focusing on the correct
marketing points on the box when they
emphasize it as like a kindle reader
because with the overall build of it
feeling very solid very nice and the the
screen being quite adequate I think that
it would make for like a great ebook
reader and since there you can access
the internet on it and we'll show you
the browsing speed in just a moment here
here let's try this one more time
watching normal quality let's see if it
gets any better
I was probably buffering right now
okay let's show you guys the browser so
we're going to go to NCIX com okay press
home okay we got a browser to do and see
I hex com let's go there oops okay let's
try that again NCI XCOM go let's try
that go button that might work better so
here's where we downloaded the YouTube v
1.3 because you can see it's not a huge
it's not like an Android YouTube app is
like specifically for the cruise reader
so I think they probably still got some
work to do as far as the app development
goes and when once once those mature a
little bit once the installed base of
these devices gets a little bit wider
than I think we'll see some definite
improvements in the overall and the
overall responsiveness of the apps here
we go so we're loading up the NCIX site
oh you can double tap to zoom in and
zoom out so that's kind of neat I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to check
out the forums you can see we've got st.
Patrick's deals going on on NCIX calm
right now
so we've moved significantly closer to
our access point and we're actually
having a little bit more success with
the browsing speed okay so let's go to
you know the main forum home
so basically i think the conclusion at
this point is that as an ereader or for
checking email actually this is pretty
unbeatable for the price but I wouldn't
expect to be doing any heavy lifting
let's see if we can get it to browse a
little bit faster now because I did have
some success with faster browsing so
here we go now we can navigate so I'm
quite close to my access point from here
and that's giving me some more success
although it's still not fast by any
stretch of the imagination for mobile
browsing but I mean it's more than
adequate for like email or whatever the
case may be so thank you for checking
