interesting little tablet this is
available at NCI ox and I was pretty
impressed with it when I first saw it
because the demo unit that was brought
to me was running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich I said oh okay so the ones in
our inventory are they running Ice Cream
Sandwich and I was told though they're
not and I said well but that's a
fantastic selling point because this is
like a hundred over dollars seven-inch
tablet running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich why why isn't it rolled out to
the ones in our stock so what they did
is they went they took them all back
they upgraded them all and everyone in
the NCIX stock is now running Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich so this is an 8
gig v700 be from advising digital right
here imported by major league global
enterprises cool cool support ok let's
go ahead and get this thing opened up
because this is actually a really really
cool tablet for the price so fairly
bare-bones accessory package you got
your power you got your data cable USB a
2 mini B you've got a very very simple
little yeah overview reset power menu
trans flash lot very simple user guide
although the whole thing is English look
at that ok turn you some basic Android
functionality cleaning cloth and the
tablet itself so here we go
it has honestly pretty much everything
that I asked for in a mobile device
including some of the things that I'm
usually like afraid to ask for because
no one seems to be willing to do it
number one is a reset switch I have
harped on this whenever I've seen it I
love having a hard reset switch because
sometimes things crash and with these
tablets it's almost impossible to rip
out the battery so it's fantastic to
have that hard reset built in we've got
our power button so I'm going to go
ahead and power it on next we've got our
ok well it's a good thing that there's a
guide in here to what all of these
things are aha there we go so we have
our AHA menu button press this button
shortly to enter the
menu interesting so we could do that
neat okay so that allows us to manage
wallpaper apps and system settings next
one is escape so that's just plate kind
of a back button that's kind of neat you
know see that integrated on to mini
tablets micro SD mini HDMI out USB
mini-b so that's for interfacing with
the tablet USB so that is for just
plugging in any old USB Drive you can
actually play 725 to 720p video I've
seen this demoed 7:20 p.m. cavies
directly off a USB Drive that is plugged
into the tablet okay there's our
headphone jack there's your power input
there's a little sticker indicating that
it's eight gigs alright I actually don't
have any I don't have any video files on
here but you know whatever so cancel the
battery is getting low that's okay so
check this out guys so I haven't
actually used Ice Cream Sandwich yet
although what I can say is it does seem
to run pretty darn smoothly considering
this is on a very very value oriented
tablet oh I think I just turned off the
Wi-Fi okay like I said guys sorry I'm
not familiar with Ice Cream Sandwich yet
so let's go ahead and see if there's any
apps on this one by default here we go
what do we got here Wi-Fi analyzers on
here although I'm not connected to Wi-Fi
yet overall I'd say the the screen
quality is the one thing about this
tablet that leaves a little bit of
something to be desired but given the
price point that really shouldn't be
that surprising and it would be unfair
of me to be you know particularly hard
on it for that so okay storage
unexpectedly removed oops my bad so
let's go in here and actually here let
me get connected to Wi-Fi here guys give
me sec okay guys we're connected to
Wi-Fi so let's go ahead and fire up the
browser it's very very snappy Oh
apparently we have to install a flash
player I wonder is that done already oh
yeah there we go okay cool so let's see
let's see what browsing is like on here
actually let's search for NCIX
where's my keyboard nope okay English
u.s. NCI x.com
I still don't like the Android keyboard
as much as I like the
keyboard but I guess that's kind of life
okay so let's go to NCIX calm overall
very usable experience once again this
is another thing that I like so much
better on iOS versus on Android the
zooming and panning around in the
browser but honestly yeah for the price
this is unbeatable I've looked at some
inexpensive tablets in the past that I
just really wasn't that impressed with
but this one is really cool especially
with these features to add more storage
output mini-hdmi as well as read
directly off the USB Drive so let's see
what it's like watching flash video on
the Internet so let's go to let's go
check out my favorite flash based whoops
no no not oh shoot oh oh that was my bad
sorry don't let that don't let that be
indicative of the accuracy of the
touchscreen that was just my bad yeah
like I said my favorite flash video
series on the internet he does Ivy do
game reviews if you guys aren't already
familiar with Yahtzee and let's watch
this one
very cool though not through the camera
here no camera on the back well look at
that these were all labeled anyway
oh no the ones that I was confused about
weren't labeled there's your speaker as
well
should be loaded soon
there we go let's make it big and play
it's not bad at all actually okay well
we're not gonna rip off yet seize
content here but let's just see how well
it runs in full-screen I'd say it's a
little bit on the choppy side for for
what I'm used to with the Galaxy Tab
10.1 that I normally use for my Android
testing but if you're just looking for
something that's you know good for
mobile browsing you know it's let's
let's let's fire up a game here guys
so guys there was a bit of a trick to
get things installed I'll show you that
after so let's just see how Angry Birds
runs here okay yeah yeah you point your
finger at the thing and then you fling
the guy oh whoops
oh I suck at this game and yeah oh okay
well the point is that it runs more than
anything else I mean yeah it's not aided
by my complete and utter ineptitude here
but whatever I think you guys get the
point
so are you gonna be running anything
like you know Tigra HD whatever anything
like that no not really I mean this is a
fairly basic tablet but will you be able
to run the basics the answer is a
resounding yes because apparently I
managed to beat this level yay so I'll
show you guys the trick on the app
market once you're on there make sure
that you select I mean maybe this is
just an Ice Cream Sandwich strangeness
thing but go to accounts and then you
have to actually see it it's already
checked but then you have to click it to
show which account you want to use in
the market otherwise it just won't
download anything so I found a Google
help topic on that so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of this advisin
tablet it's actually pretty darn
impressive considering everything don't
forget to subscribe to honest tech tips
from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and of course guys
there's the obligatory iPhone for size
comparison so there you go that's how
big it is compared to an iPhone 4 and
that yeah there that is how thick it is
oops I should just bring this up here
that is how thick it is compared to an
iPhone 4 now don't forget to subscribe
for more iPhone for size comparisons</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
