released several years ago I was like
WTF razor a laptop without a dedicated
graphics card I thought you guys were
like four gamers by gamers what's your
Excuse
but then between the hardware upgrades
and whether I'd like to admit it or not
the benefits of not having a GPU like a
slimmer design and better battery life
the stealth actually grew on me to the
point where for the last year my Blade
stealth has been in my backpack going
everywhere this job takes me so needless
to say I was stoked about the new 2018
razor blade stealth that is until I got
one it will not be going into my
backpack and I guess we should take a
look at why
save money on games and help support
charity through Humble Bundle
you can learn more through our partner
link in the video description I'm still
really undecided about razors new boxy
design language that's made its way from
the razor phone over to their laptops in
the last year and a half on the blade 15
it made a bit more sense to me because
there are thermal advantages oh and I do
appreciate the sliminess of the bezels
but on the stealth I'm gonna be carrying
it with me like in my hand a lot and the
sharp edges just aren't as comfortable
in the hand subjectively though it looks
damn fine with an exceptionally rigid
chassis and an overall premium feel and
they removed the lighting on the rear
Razer logo a change that will help users
avoid the potentially embarrassing
situation where they show up for an
important meeting and they've got like
this weird game arelooking thing on the
table compared to last year's model
there have been some sacrifices made to
the i/o HDMI being the notable cut but
with two USB see connections now one
with Thunderbolt 3 and both of them with
charging support along with two USB
Taipei's and a headphone jack it's hard
to complain too much about the extra
dongle that you'd have to carry what I
will complain about though is the
increase in power yes you heard me right
I hate that Razer made the stealth more
powerful and more power hungry by
including a dedicated GPU I mean sure
the MX 154 gig is better than nothing
but the issue here is that it's not in
an experienced changing way like casual
games like rocket League and dota they
will run in some cases multiple times
faster than onboard graphics but for
anything triple-a you can expect to run
at 720p resolution low settings and then
be thrilled if you get over 30 frames
per second one of razors other
justifications here is that it improves
performance for content creators for you
know editing videos on the going
such but I just don't see it like the
quad core Core i7 CPU is able to hold
its own pretty well in light video
editing on the old stealth or in the
surface laptop - but our guidance has
still always been that if you want to do
any serious video editing then you
should consider either the full-blown
razor blade or something like the asus
strix car which has six cores and a
full-blown gaming GPU for the same price
which brings us perfectly to the most
offensive part of all of this the fact
that the MX 150 is a $200 upgrade option
that must be selected in order to get
touchscreen functionality along with the
4k display option which adds an extra
$300 on top of the already ballooning
price on that note I hate the direction
that they've gone with the display
options in general here I mean sure 4k
is awesome and makes a difference on a
77 inch TV but on a 13-inch laptop those
extra pixels just mostly reduce battery
life and the most galling part of this
is that razor already had found a great
balance my 2017 model has an 1800 people
that has a noticeable boosting clarity
over 1080p without the drawbacks of 4k
and it has touch I mean if they were
gonna change things up why not do
something good like put in a taller
display like on the new MacBook Air and
the surface laptop to increase
productivity you know that second reason
why it has a dedicated GPU I mean they
added some stuff that we've been asking
for like Windows hello facial
recognition which is IMHO the best way
to unlock a laptop currently but then
they just continue to do more things
therefore frustrating like the webcam
next to it it's pretty schmitt to put it
mildly
and speaking of SH man the keyboard it's
great that they were able to backlight
the secondary functions I was really
excited when I saw this at CES but the
layout sucks and the switches
inconsistent so to start again the new
boxy design means that people with
larger hands will actually have their
palms rest on the sharp edge of the
laptop so we're not off to a great start
here and while the switches I would say
have above-average stabilization and a
nice tactile feel if a little bit mushy
the tactile bump happens before the
actual key actuation and the actuation
force is noticeably different from one
key to the next so I ended up having to
kind of Hulk mode type in order to make
sure that every stroke got registered
honestly though I could live with all of
that if it wasn't for the layout like
who thought this shift key was okay I
would actually like to speak to that
individual and I will personally pay for
him or her to attend both a typing and a
grammar workshop so that he or she can
become more familiar with the home row
method of typing and the importance of
proper capitalization like I've gotten
used to weird layouts before and I'll
probably do it again but this one is
just it's worse in ways that are just
unnecessary like if they had just kept
the key layout this keyboard might have
still gotten an a-minus or a b-plus but
as it is I think we're in c-plus
territory but let's bring it back for a
moment because you know what gets a
solid a plus this trackpad every other
Windows notebook maker should be paying
close attention right now and taking
note of how razer used all of the
available vertical space to enlarge
their touchpad it really does make a big
difference and it's awesome another area
where razer has beaten out most of the
competition is upgradability removing
the Stealth's bottom gives you easy
access to the solid 54 watt hour battery
which should be able to keep you going
for a full workday assuming you're not
gaming or video editing haha and you can
upgrade the m-dot to drive as well and I
mean okay the RAM is still soldered but
that really does seem more about the
state of the industry as a whole than it
does about
sort of razor because I'm finding myself
saying at least they didn't glue the
whole thing together
Microsoft bottom line though is this
I've actually been pretty hard on the
stealth for this entire review and some
people at Razer might even use the word
unfair but there is a reason for it the
price if you're making the most
expensive Windows Ultrabook you also
need to be making the best windows
ultrabook which means that we're gonna
go a little harder on it doesn't it so
the base price for this thing without
the GPU is fourteen hundred dollars and
for that kind of money
you could buy an XPS 13 or a surface
laptop to you get the same performance
along with better keyboards and screens
in either case then if you do throw the
GPU in here which I guess is razors kind
of main differentiating point you are up
to sixteen hundred dollars now for that
money you can buy a surface laptop two
and a Nintendo switch since then you can
get a better notebook experience and a
better casual gaming experience or you
could even get a 13-inch MacBook Pro
since somehow that's starting to look
like a reasonably priced option now and
then if you upgrade to the 4k touch
display which is when this thing does
finally become a very competent notebook
no touch on the lower end ones come on
it's up to 1900 US dollars at that price
you could get a surface book - 13-inch
with the much better gtx 1050 TI or like
basically any other perfectly good
notebook a Nintendo switch and take your
mom to a nice dinner or something it
really does seem like a better way to
spend your hard-earned dollars to me
since for my part even not having paid
for either of these it's pretty clear to
me which one is going back in my
backpack
at least until LG tries to knock it out
with the next gram normally these
sponsor spots are pretty long but I'm
gonna save you guys some time private
