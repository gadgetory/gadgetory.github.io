we're live now yep hey welcome to the
wine show were a little late I was busy
rebuilding my dream PC from when I was a
teenager did you know that that's what
we were working on no so when did you
get into computer hardware I'm trying to
remember what was what was the shiz like
what did you lust after when you first
got into it when I first got into
computer hardware there was no like I
don't know how to say this
I was so my family aggressively did not
have money and I definitely didn't have
very good methods of making my own I had
some I started working when I was like
11 or 12 or something right but the kind
of work you're doing at that age you're
not raising large funds to buy sweet
things
so I purposefully even at that age was
like I'm just gonna not look so like I
don't actually know what the like fatty
items were when I first jumped into it
but I dealt with a lot of scrapping
people's computers and working with
other people's stuff and looking online
on how I could make those things work
but I like purposefully didn't look at
the new things that were out there cuz I
didn't want to see like oh this
reasonably-priced new computer has four
times the RAM you have I'm just like
okay that's soul-crushing
so like I don't actually really know God
by the time I was buying stuff like
actually we have the wrong title I
updated it yeah did I do it in the wrong
thing oh well the computer's been
restarted Oh No
what's the title supposed to be oh no is
everything wrong Linux is in Windows
that's what I said of that Windows now
comes with it's on twitch Linux when
show May 5th 2019 May 10th mate Oh oh
wow yeah it's the 10th when ok neat I
don't I don't know if that updates now
it how does this work
also are these the sponsors must have
done it to the old vaad probably gone no
that would be on floatplane
if you just did it over there that and
copy those though no those are those are
the wrong ones
oh wow cuz that was okay why don't we
jump into it yeah intro
[Laughter]
there's cool topics and stuff and get to
it in a moment
I must update the fathers oh boy oh that
that's bad team yeah okay
or it just didn't say if the computers
been restarted some nothing good twilit
honey the font changes between your
things madrina is thank you
this is terrific
this is terrific welcome my friends to
the LAN show because this this is what
it's really about isn't it pure quality
hanging out on a Friday no idea what's
going on 44 minutes late
you literally copied copy pasted the
part of the instruction that says
sponsor video description block in
brackets copy paste the below text heck
yeah I'm just gonna I'm just gonna share
that with our friends on my screen
sharing even works I mean does not
watching they can see it okay it did
before the computer is restarted and I
was not the one that we started the
computer everything was fine why did we
restart the computer the audio wasn't
working uh there was a very legitimate
reason I don't even I don't even I can't
even go to switch seats for insects why
we know it's fine I just I thought there
was a I thought there was a thing Adam
show stream is the most well refined
stream where I think you want a
properties thing yeah I don't see it
there though I don't see the
stop-and-start thing it's not there it's
not there I don't know the black magic
stuff I only know the
okay trying to do again I'm trying to
over talking about Microsoft oh all the
news we got us Microsoft stuff I do also
have some links to Google i/o there's no
notes for it sure but make it talk of a
week we can still talk about it so
probably fine
this might be another one of those just
like you know talking about stuff land
shares so yeah Microsoft Microsoft will
be apparently shipping a full Linux
kernel within Windows 10 this is
supposed to be Nowak on the forum see
how quickly I regained my composure good
job and basically in a nutshell they're
planning to ship a full Linux kernel
directly in Windows and that's the first
time that the Linux kernel will be
included as part of Windows this is
basically starting with the windows
insider builds that are coming this
summer so it's not like you're just like
running Linux immediately and to be
clued to be clear it's not gonna be like
a like I don't know I don't know what I
would have even like if someone told me
Linux is gonna be in Windows I don't
even know what I would have expected
like a weird virtual machine environment
or like I like yeah I don't know what I
would have expected but basically it's
an in-house custom built Linux kernel
that are gonna underpin the newest
version of windows subsystem for Linux
it's gonna be initially based on version
4.1 9 which is the latest long-term
stable release of Linux and it will be
rebased at the designation at the
designation of new long-term stable
releases to ensure that the wsl kernel
always has the latest linux goodness so
what does this mean like what does this
mean like I can I can install Linux
software I know those like what honestly
I wish I was more informed I have no
idea oh well that's awkward yeah awkward
thank you in advance YouTube chat who
I'm sure is going to be jumping in
and and telling us all about this well
apparently the thumbnail is still from
the earlier video - I'm assuming yeah I
see some cons about this - here I'm
assuming this size into our next topic
which is new Windows terminal which has
you can select your command line app of
choice of command from PowerShell Ubuntu
or W on WS L or Raspberry Pi via SSH etc
that sounds like it ties in quite
directly I think its new terminal stuff
I don't think there's gonna be a lot of
like hey my Windows is running Linux I
think it's just gonna give you more more
access to more tools which is really
cool but I don't think it's actually
gonna change pretty much anything for
the vast majority of users which is fine
we're at the point where most operating
systems are kind of like that but yeah
this seems to fall in line in my opinion
with Satya Nadella is like each
department should do the best thing they
possibly can for their department
instead of needing to force Microsoft
stuff only and nothing else ever into
everything they possibly can so that's
cool in other big news the latest word
on the street and this this is a I have
no idea how credible it is but it's
being reported pretty broadly so take it
for what it is it's rumor mill nonsense
but word on the street is that AMD's
Rison 3000 series is going to include -
16 core mainstream desktop CPUs now I
don't even know if with a straight face
you can really call that mainstream but
I guess the definitions changing yeah so
at the same time like I was thinking
about this the other day
yeah and I'm super happy this is really
cool news yeah I'm happy hardware's
pushing forward yeah my roommate still
runs on a 3000 series processor and
plays whatever games he wants just fine
Oh like a 3000 series Intel processor
right so like a 3770k or 35 70 K or
something yeah
yep and like he plays apex and pretty
much whatever else he really feels like
and it's it's totally okay
I'd really uh I was watching a video
recently talking about how like oh we
haven't had like a new crisis experience
in a while we're like a game comes out
and it's just like holy crap that's
amazing it looks great absolutely
incredible but it's really hard on
hardware you've seen a lot of demos like
Nvidia did that incredible ray-tracing
demo with the stormtroopers and the
elevator there's been some really great
racing demos in general there's been a
few of them but we haven't had that one
game that comes out and it's like at
least lighting wise which is a massive
portion of it indiscernible from reality
which we're getting really really really
close and some demos have been amazing
have you seen minecraft with ray-tracing
no it's actually incredible do you have
like a Microsoft actually produced no it
was um digital foundry oh of course
okay it minecraft with ray-tracing so
what exactly did they do hold on yeah
I'm gonna go ahead my stream I'm gonna
see if your screen your screen share
doesn't work either okay
it was it was before the before the
restart we fixed audio and it broke
everything else it's fantastic do we
even know that the audio is fixed I mean
I haven't gotten a whole bunch of text
messages so I'm assuming yes we didn't
touch it laptop captures not working and
I don't know how to reset these yeah
like wow you can't see it you guys can't
see it but yeah great we show you guys
this amazing digital foundry minecraft
racing live play it's uh it's pretty
fantastic that would be your first
problem well I want them to go outside
though alright Luke you're coming up
you're coming in hot
oh wait no you're not you're coming too
not there you go Hey alright yeah you
just have to switch it from SDI to HDMI
that's the way to reverse the reverse
yeah
I know and the other ones used to be
able to deactivate and activate them
which is why I got confused because I
assumed there would be a way to
deactivate and activate these ones but
there isn't that's what happens when you
let Jake build your thing so Wow isn't
that crazy that actually looks it's so
much nice better yeah then regular
minecraft yeah there's a there's some
other cool scenarios that they go
through this using like Nvidia's ray
tracing tech is this arty axe or is this
just it's minecraft so it's just brute
force honestly I didn't think we were
going this direction on the way on show
so I don't have this information ready
but but yeah it's it's all I know is
it's ray tracing right there look at the
water oh wait hold on I switched away
from you the light reflections on the
water is oh no I know oh yeah there we
go
Wow super cool and like I'm sure there's
other mods going on here
yeah but the ray tracing itself just
makes the game look completely different
I have to confess I have still never
played Minecraft apparently it's getting
like more popular again now oh really
who knows it'll just never die it'll
keep going well I don't see why it would
because it's in the same way that like
why would Lego ever die yeah you're
always gonna want it let me go build
something yeah yeah you've never played
it I've okay so to be clear I've opened
the program and I've like wandered
around for three minutes and gotten
confused because I just okay I don't I
don't really get it yeah but like I I
there wasn't a tutorial or anything so I
was just like okay now I have some grass
and a dead cow I like I thought I built
some amazing thing and then I like went
on YouTube and was like nope nope I'm
terrible I'm the worst and then I
decided that I would never be able to
build anything actually cool so I just
built a treehouse and then quit okay
that's my mind Minecraft that's your
entire Minecraft jewelry but looks
beautiful with ray-tracing
I just I don't know I I think maybe I
have a little bit of hardware fatigue
right okay just because
I don't see it getting utilized super
well so I mean you can always find use
cases absolutely so okay let's say so
let's go back to let's go back to that
rumor which I can actually show you guys
now on the employer net here there's
like some typos in this article and
stuff but we're just gonna hit on the
main beats yeah so they are they are
saying that they believe the rise in
3,800 X and 3850 X will be at the top of
the processor line up they'll both be 16
core 32 I'm sure they mean threads here
and they'll be among the eight CPUs that
they'll be launching this month so this
is a tweet from APUs AK sayings n2 so
remember guys risin 3000 series is
reportedly going to be Zen - not Zen +
like Zen improved like we got the rise
in 2000 series so it was a little
confusing because you had rise in with
the number one and then the rest of the
model number and then you had rise in
two and stuff but that wasn't rise in
two so rise in two has to be based on
the Zen - architects for not just like
fine-tuned for better memory
compatibility and like slightly better
clock speeds so what we're looking at
apparently and this is based on an
engineering sample that allegedly turned
up is a base clock of 3.3 gigahertz a
boost of 4.2 just sound and pretty darn
good and this was running on an x5 70
motherboard so frankly it actually
sounds reasonably plausible and this is
allegedly again what the full lineup
might look like and if this is true wait
what is this this is kind of conflicting
with it someone else said this is an
early sample there's room for
improvement last December this
apparently surfaced but we don't know
how much truth there is to it I would be
very surprised to see a 16 core
processor with a base of 4.3 and a boost
to 5.1 I think that might be a fanboy
fever dream but if
AMD does pull this off then boy is Intel
ever gonna have something to react to
and the bizarre thing from Intel side
especially right now is that because
they're currently experiencing a
shortage on all of their 14 nanometer
plus plus products they aren't even
really in a position to drop pricing no
so the thing about that is that even if
this processor launched from AMD doesn't
affect Intel sales because they can
effectively sell everything they can
make at the price that they've already
set what it could at the very least do
is affect Intel's perception among
enthusiasts because if Intel doesn't
drop their price that does the kind of
damage to your brand over the longer
term that's really hard to get away from
Oh Intel is overpriced Intel's a ripoff
AMD gives you better performance at the
same price or it gives you the same
performance for a lower price like
that's the kind of perception that
sticks with you and it's easy for
especially people who pay really close
attention to technology news to go will
know because you know Intel might
Conroe the market again and completely
you know turn AMD on its head but here's
the thing
I still get people you know just talking
to me in casual conversation like oh I
didn't get Andy because AMD runs hot
it's like well though AMD made
processors at one point that did run
pretty hot old pipe news dies hard
exactly so it can take you years it has
been over two years since AMD launched
Rison think about that for a minute
that's actually kind of spooky right I
feels like it was so recent right it's
been over two years makes sense though
and you still get people saying things
like Oh AMD runs really hot well no
Rison doesn't like
anything runs hot if you overclock it or
whatever but no Rison has very
reasonable thermals and you mean you ran
into the same thing like back in the
until Prescott days so there was a time
back in like I don't know mm mm 6
whenever it was 2007
I don't know when when Intel's
processors ran so hot that those systems
if you if you can get your hands on
something like an intel prescott 3.4 3.6
gigahertz or something like that that's
still running today i guarantee you the
motherboard is like darkened i was gonna
say the still running today part it
would be surprising yeah like the chip
might work there's no way that
motherboard works those things suck so
much power they ran so freakin hot and
that plagued intel again for years oh
I'm gonna get AMD because because Intel
CPUs run hot so this has the potential
if any of this is even remotely true to
do long-term damage to Intel's
perception among enthusiasts and the
thing about enthusiasts is that they're
frankly aren't that many of them I think
that sometimes the like the high-end
gaming community and the enthusiast in
overclocking communities get all you
know up in their own self-importance
thinking that they actually matter when
the reality of it is in a given quarter
one major OAM like a Dell or an HP is
probably moving more CPUs than your
entire market segment over like a year
or more like bats the cold hard truth
and yes the enthusiast segment does by
higher margin like K unlocks chips and
all that kind of stuff but manat you're
not gonna make her break a brand like
Intel or even AMD at this point now that
they're finally winning some OEM
contracts but what you do have the power
to do is you have the power to influence
this
around you you know if you talking like
that I would say I think there's quite a
bit of exactly yeah so talking to you
the viewer right now each one of you I'm
sure sometime in the last month someone
be they friend or family has come to you
with tech advice exactly the family tech
exactly sometimes it's like totally
irrelevant like my in-laws the other day
I was over there for dinner and they
pull out this they're like yeah we got
this this thing from Costco and we'd we
don't know how to use it and I'm like
lordy what is it this time
and they pull it out and it's a
solar-powered like motion sensing light
for their porch okay and I'm like it's
part of my electricity though man you
know how it works like I've never set
one of these up before like it I think
my superpower must be that I can just
read a manual yeah honestly a lot of the
time isn't that just all it is a lot of
the time like how to use a piece of
software like clicking things seeing
what they do and they break everything
no okay that's good control-z yeah it's
probably undoable mousing over reading
the little text that pops up so anyway
I'm looking at this thing I'm like okay
so it's got a it's got a light all right
it's got a little thing in the front
that's your motion sensor and then
there's this wire and it's got a solar
panel so this probably goes where you
want light when it detects a thing and
then this probably goes where the Sun is
will do they need to go together well
there's a very long wire on it so anyway
sometimes so sometimes it's totally off
world's greatest detective yeah but
other times you're really influencing
key decisions like hey you know what
laptop should I get and non-techie
people if we're being honest they
actually don't care no they just want to
make sure that they're not doing
something notably stupid so if you're
like that one you're coming from at
least somewhat informed position and
they're like okay cool
like my aunt for example I always end up
picking on my poor aunt just very nice
person didn't know the difference
between an iPhone and an Android phone
okay so I was like what kind of phone do
you want she's like well I have an
iPhone main well it's a 5c and this is
like four months ago I really should
have just upgraded her earlier it
doesn't matter the point is she's like
I've got an iPhone I just want something
that I don't have to relearn and I'm
like okay you're gonna be relearning so
here's the thing Apple get away you know
that one button one button you still had
it's gone with that said I could give
you an older Android device that still
has a button so functionally it's
actually more similar to your old iPhone
than a new iPhone is to your old iPhone
and she kind of looked at both of them
didn't understand either of them when I
showed her the new ones and I was like
okay so you had a picture of a phone you
still got a picture of a phone you just
touched the phone right but this one
where's the dialpad
and I'm like but it's fine the dial pads
here but the iPhone it brings up the
contacts first I'm like right but they
both got both options it's okay anyway
at the end of the day she wanted the
iPhone because she knew the iPhone but
she could have just as easily learned an
Android phone it actually didn't matter
and I think a lot of the time especially
the people that have both techie
families and techie social circles can
totally lose track of how normal people
operate because you get so caught up in
these little details like oh well the
MacBook Pro Thermal throttles to 15
percent of the time so at the most
people are probably only ever gonna like
browse Facebook regardless of whether
they get a Mac or a Windows PC so it
comes down to just getting whatever like
makes them happy so you you the tech
influencer have a lot of power here
because at the end of the day they're
just probably gonna get whatever you say
or they're not gonna get what you say at
some point they'll probably regret it
maybe they'll get what you say next time
I'm trying to find this two rabbis going
with that this is this is pretty someone
off-topic but I'm sure I find this
thread where I've I want to throw the
forum under the bus pretty hard we don't
get the end I mean we wouldn't have
anyways because there's no real reason
to you but we don't really get rid of
stuff on the forum unless it's like like
we don't get rid of stuff that attacks
us and this was attacking other people
right sometimes we would get rid of but
it was all anonymous who it was okay but
it's I don't were the exact thread name
but it was in general discussion years
ago and I'm sure it's still alive
because it was surviving many years
after the point where his posted but it
was like tails from tech support the
name wasn't exactly that yeah I don't
know your experience with non-techies
yeah yeah super legendary massive threat
on the forum and I've hated it I have
thought about killing actually here it
is experiences with non-techies it's got
like one thousand two hundred and thirty
eight pages and I think this is sort of
an example of okay well this one from
one of our moderators actually pretty
fair people putting stuff on top of an
electric baseboard seriously why do
people do that
that's not even well it is kind of tacky
electric baseboard it's is it technology
or not okay but a wheels technology okay
a string is technology
some people sewing is technology so
she'll probably never watching this I
think I'm pretty safe ecology pretty but
we had a nanny at what sir technology
that couldn't manage to put like the
forks in the fork tray and the spoons in
the spoon tray I'm not talking like the
big forks in the small ports I'm talking
like forks and spoons I think you know
sort of how much respect I have it's
something I don't talk about much on the
land show by Ed like the best part too
is I know you have a particular thing
about dishwasher organization I and and
I'm very fussy when it comes it's one of
my ass be things so I can totally
believe that that just drove you wild
it's the kind of thing where like I will
open the drawer to get a thing and it's
not like it's kind of it's bad enough
that I have to like dig through it in
order to find the thing I need but then
I have to reorganize the hole yeah yeah
but a fork is technology but to change
gears a little bit
here's also techno to change gears a
little bit here I think that we all need
to reflect once in a while and try to
imagine something that that we don't
know anything we know a laughably small
amount about but that someone else who
frankly doesn't know or care about the
difference between a Mac and a Windows
PC might be an expert in like if you
were to get dumped onto a farm would you
do any like I'm talking a real one would
you be able to operate the equipment or
deal with the animals any better than
that let's say farmer would be able to
sit down and and describe the nuances of
iOS versus engine like I'd be honest I'm
sure there's crossover in both those
directions of course what I was just
using it as an example of something that
you might not know anything I was just
pointing it so people don't freak out of
course there's plenty of tech literate
farmers in fact farming is more
technology heavy than it's ever been
there's actually a lot of very high tech
stuff in farming but I know a definition
technology everything's technology but
so yeah I don't know i I've always hated
that thread because it's like oh come on
give it a break Gandhi asks if Linus
really has autism so my family has a lot
of autism in it
the way that I would describe myself is
to say I have a touch of the ass beat
now Asperger's is no longer considered
by the
w-h-o a real disorder because - oh yeah
I was a while back because to say that
feeling socially awkward and like you
are made I'm come about certain things
is like I mean there's a reason they
call it autism spectrum disorder like
that's everybody as far as who's not on
it yeah that's what I want to know okay
so yeah I do have some ticki behaviors I
do have some things that make me
irrational like irrationally frustrated
like like I just like I can't handle it
but no I would I have never been
diagnosed with autism it's it's just
something that like I said runs in my
family pretty strongly and we all sit
somewhere on there for sure just to
varying degrees so they're right my
t-shirt is technology according to
YouTube chat yep
noise bombs farming the most underrated
technology by a long shot
there's actually okay you know what if
you want to go down a weird youtube
rabbit hole there's some pretty wild
farming tech okay just you know you can
you can go down the rabbit hole if you
want we should probably do maybe a wild
oh man that timing this wallet is
technology it's technology yeah stop
carrying pointless items around in your
pocket like receipts old hotel room keys
or spent gift I wonder how many of those
things I legitimately have in my wallet
right now like a week ago I pitched a
old hotel room receipt you know what I
was actually pretty sure I had an old
hotel room key I must have gotten rid of
it because I accidentally kept one from
my last try my mine was legit like last
week or something I don't have any spent
gift cards I actually keep mine Wow like
actually keep pretty clean these days do
you want to play what do you have in
your wallet spend gift card
nice yeah so I've receipts in Spain gift
card I don't have old hotel room
because I got rid of it last week okay I
would have been three for three though
so I've got my my health insurance
benefits card yeah I've got my BCAA
membership this one expired I don't
think it actually matters I don't think
your number changes I've got my driver's
license I've got my Costco card okay so
far we're exactly tired executive member
nice thing of beauty I've got my access
card for for work yep for one so far
okay now I lose two three three debit
cards those are all debit those are all
debit yeah oh so the reason is that I've
got my my joint account with the wife
ooh okay I've got my my work debit card
and then I've also got my just in case
we ever get divorced I still need to
have a bank account never cut no I'm
just kidding I've just been a customer
at TD since I was like six and I think
having a very very long standing account
can have advantages if you ever go to
negotiate with them unlike something
it's a free account so it cost me
nothing to have it I just have to have a
balance of like greater than ten dollars
or something like that so I just hold on
to it just in case like the other thing
too is because Yvonne handles all of our
money it's really hard for me to do
simple things like buy her a birthday
present without right because she'd see
it's showing up on the credit card and
yeah and so like I've had to resort to
stupid things like hey hon don't look at
the credit card statement for a bit and
don't log into Amazon and she's like I'm
actually your accountant I actually need
to do okay so uh you're gonna see the
line item before you see the item itself
yeah so I so I have three debit cards
and then I have four credit cards I have
well personal and business Canadian
cards and then personal and business USD
cards
yeah you've got me there I also have
some cash retro I have some cash you got
some cash vielen rat chow yep and then I
did I had one receipt so I actually I
actually run a fairly tight ship but I
do think I need to get change
no no change so my system for change is
actually pretty straightforward I
downgraded to a smaller wallet so I
actually fully support the smaller
wallet assuming you don't have too many
cards for it
I actually downgraded to a smaller
wallet a number of you well you can see
how many years ago it was I really need
probably you've pretty much had that
wallet the whole time I've known you I
think oh definitely yeah oh yeah for
sure
yeah so so I downgraded because I had
resolved to not carry around change or
too many receipts anymore okay and so I
devised a new system for change so the
only thing I really use change for is to
pay an exact change for a Monday night
badminton okay and for like hot lunch
day for my son school and like stuff
like that like when I need to send money
to school sure so I do need change
but I don't need it on me sorry okay
change goes along with my screwdriver in
my back right pocket okay and then
deposited every night at the end of the
day I put it in my change bucket okay
and then anytime I need change I get it
from there so I never actually spend
change I only a choir change and then
when I specifically need it so we did a
staycation because one of the things
that one of my daughter's asked to do on
our vacation was to ride the bus and I
was like well that's a cheap date cool
so we needed to go ride the bus as a
family I had somewhere to go for change
because you can't not have any change
mm-hmm that's inconvenient I when I
travel I like to have some cash on me
and deal with cash sometimes just
because everyone smile your cards will
freak out and I like to just have some
amount of local cash and then I also
really like collecting relatively small
denominations but still have a little
bit of the change and a little bit of
the cash from different countries that I
go to just because I find it really
interesting
how they keep their stuff so then I
often have like some weird mix of change
from multiple different countries in the
pocket until I deposit at home which I
constantly forget to do but yeah this is
actually pretty sick actually a number
of people internally a switch to we
should probably do the actual talking
points here that would program helps you
carry less it uses two metal RFID
blocking plates that are bound by a
strong elastic band that keeps your
cards tightly together but still
accessible you just pop them out like
that and then they just kind of look
like in like that looks and feels slick
comes in different materials like
aluminum carbon fiber and titanium and
makes a great gift for Father's Day
which is June 16th by the way guys more
importantly Mother's Day this Sunday
don't forget PSA PSA Mother's Day this
Sunday at least send her a text message
all right bare minimum and and learn
this the hard way your wife of your
children your mother of your to also a
mother
make sure you acknowledge her too don't
miss that one that was that there was
this one Mother's Day when like are you
setting a reminder for yourself and I'm
sending a tweet generally I do tweet
reminders for everybody to try to help I
know maybe our community isn't the
greatest at remembering these types of
things
remember the like experience with
non-techies thing our community is not
necessarily great at certain other stuff
so I try to help other people because I
have problems remembering these things
as well so when I get reminded I tweet
it out and help other people are funny
and then them responding to the tweet
constantly reminds me that it's coming
so it's actually helpful for me as well
I try not to generalize but the thing is
like within the techie community
community I would say that consideration
for things like special occasions is
generally on the low end yeah
with a general population the likelihood
of a data let's say in a company okay in
a company of mostly techie people like
this one versus a company of like my
wife's old job as a pharmacist
so a pharmacy where it's predominantly
female with technology the likelihood of
someone showing up at our office with
cupcakes to celebrate someone's birthday
or like or a handcrafted gift to
celebrate someone having a baby that
everyone signs and like hand delivers to
them much less likely here much more
likely there I'm not gonna I'm not to
generalize I'm just saying guys I'm
horrible with this stuff
I'm absolutely terrible about it it's
always been kind of helpful for me
because I am terrible about it and
traditionally my boss man doesn't give
two craps at all yeah forget my birthday
365 times a year my birthday
even though time's it I do remember
usually just like okay cool see it and
the great thing is you'll usually be
right yeah I get it yeah like a very
high percentage of the time yeah higher
than 99 you saw it it'll have more
uptime than floatplane whoa footprints
actually had pretty good actually it's
not very good I was just thinking about
my head I was like wait maybe not next
Yeah right oh right wow it's taking us a
while before our sponsors yeah sorry
about that
I also brought to you but well I don't
know we ended up talking about other
things that's also brought to you by
honey so when you buy something online
and find out later you could have got it
for less that sucks
unfortunately online coupon codes can be
a total pain in the arse like honestly
who hasn't done this Google like cuz
you'll you'll be in the checkout and
there it is it's tantalizing the coupon
code field or the voucher field
someone's probably got one of those
someone probably has gonna have that too
so you google it
come at me and you come up with like all
these results and there's all these even
like large websites that are dedicated
to compiling all of these coupon codes
and you enter the ball in and none of
them forget work so honey does all of
that for
it's a free browser extension that saves
you money when you shop online
honey scans the internet for coupon
codes and other discounts then like
magic it automatically applies them to
your cart at checkout it knows a lot of
coupon codes sale or discount codes at
over 37,000 sites like Amazon Newegg
Best Buy Gamestop Walmart eBay and more
it takes just two clicks to install so
head over to honeycomb forward slash
Linus and install honey for free today
well it's people in the office use it
including me it's pretty sweet also
brought to you by madrenas coffee oh man
so uh madrenas they sponsored the roast
yes as you know yep and we had a bit of
a snafu with the the youtube version of
the roast which by the way ladies and
gentlemen will be going live on which
one is it oh wow tomorrow I was just
gonna say Leeds tomorrow oh so be going
live on Saturday tomorrow at around noon
we had a bit of a snafu with it today
where we uploaded it and we didn't make
it public but we accidentally added it
to a playlist so a handful of people
happened across it and I think this is
going to be a fairly polarizing piece of
content yeah
not everyone is gonna like it hopefully
you don't judge me or madrenas based on
the things that are said by some of the
people in the roast which i think might
have been happening but just remember
guys as you're watching it it was all in
good fun and we're still friends and
it's all good people we're more people
worried about us so they wrote a lot of
comments but the like/dislike ratio was
one to two whoa okay how many people saw
it though not many it only had about 50
views okay but it had eight dislikes
yeah that's that's kind of weird
pretty strong yeah the weird thing is
almost everyone absolutely loved it on
Flo plain yeah
who where we'll find kind of our super I
think super supporters I think you're
gonna get more people there that
understand because they know the people
that are on stage more more likely
because you're you're cutting out I know
there's definitely gonna be people that
watch on YouTube that just like yeah
either don't want to or don't have the
cash to watch on flow plane that are
super hardcore fans that's totally cool
yeah but you're also gonna have a higher
percentage of people that aren't yeah
and if you're not very familiar with
everyone on stage and how friendly those
people actually are some of those
interactions might come across a little
weird I'm not sure I don't know yeah I
honestly like watch I've watched the
entire thing through about four times
now and it was entertaining every single
time I think it's a fantastic piece of
content I think the only thing that
makes me sad about it yes the the audio
tracks yeah the audience audio is not
ideal
yeah and I'm I come through everything
yeah my laugh gets through everybody's
mic so we didn't actually have for
whatever reason the production company
that helped us with it did not provide
the multi-channel audio for the evening
so we couldn't just turn you down when
you weren't talking oh we only got a
single audio track so with everything
mixed that makes more sense I was like
why I know my laugh is ridiculous but
now this is a little mess so what I
would recommend in order to have the
best experience with it is to turn the
volume up higher than you normally would
Luke's gonna be super loud but you'll be
able to hear the audience reacting to
the jokes which adds a lot it's gonna
add a lot because the the biggest
problem is like something will be funny
and the the presenter person will pause
for laughter and you just like stare at
them sitting there it's like okay it's
really regrettable that we didn't have a
we we were considering putting in a
laugh track but we ended up opting to
leave it o natural for better or worse
yeah
because the thing about a laugh track is
there's so many different
laughter reactions Oh
like it's just it's so varied that
weren't we weren't gonna be able to make
it good so I would rather just leave it
natural and then at least people can
have you know nerf or worse I've lost
showed a couple of times too though I I
do find it quite funny but I can also
yeah I don't know I can understand why
some people it might not be their cup of
tea I don't know some of the dislikes
might have also been like hey this isn't
what this playlist supposed no we've
accidentally put stuff in playlists
before that it's not really alright okay
should we show a short like teaser sure
is that a good idea
sure okay it's going live anyways yeah
yeah okay let's let's do it let's do a
short teaser for anyone who hasn't seen
it yet you just show it on floatplane so
here you go ladies and gentlemen oh do
they have this might show the URL right
oh the unlisted URL what what a
tremendous thought that I didn't think
of hooray um Oh actually there's a
floatplane exclusive I don't know if you
saw this this one up dude that's cool
the red all the red carpet interviews
director's cut and I believe by
director's cut we mean completely not
cut no I don't think I can show the
floatplane one all right yes I can
answer this one okay all right
so I'm gonna turn on audio I don't know
how well that's gonna work but I mean we
do have a warning on it in fairness to
us man I love this intro wait for it
wait for it wait for it after I think
master yeah last day it's spelled right
yeah I know we fixed that for the
YouTube release just minor things and
that weird interlacing issue we fixed
that too I look so ridiculous in my my
like grand theft auto intro screen thing
yeah
that stage was so cool I know it ended
up looking so great in James's grandiose
intro someone with a Chinese username
says what's funny is people think they
actually read this chat occasionally we
do I don't know if they can actually
hear this or no audio I haven't okay
yeah that's no it's it's fine it's fine
anyway it looks really good
and yeah we're gonna have to figure out
if we can get audio so thankfully check
yeah thanks thanks guys oh man I hope
people like it do we have any other main
topics today or did it take us that oh
wait I never did the madrenas talking
points okay so good luck madrenas
hopefully everyone doesn't hate you and
us yeah you know if you guys liked the
roast then you know
please help keep madrenas afloat by
ordering their coffee for fuel their
organic cold brew coffee and convenient
16-ounce cans sixty knows they're 15
ounces them and they're rounding up
they're like well everyone does it I'm
like I don't care they're 15 ounce cans
with a flavor for everyone and we're
launching our second branded product the
LTT vanilla cult brew with madrenas
coffee that's on tomorrow's youtube
release so be sure to watch that episode
and also we have of course the Lambeau
row so it's madrenas coffee calm slash
lioness to get 40% off your order
with code Linus I'm also really excited
about the exclusive exclusive out in a
limited edition because we're we we
actually can't get enough shirts to
print as many of these as we want but
the limited edition ltte Roast
commemorative t-shirt have you seen this
have you got this check it out so oh yes
y'all have seen that that's legit it's
the this is fine meme sort of inspired
we only have I think about 600 of them
or something like that that's like all
that we could get in this shirt color
and I really
really wanted the red one for this so I
am not expecting these to last past
about the first hour or two yeah
now to be clear we don't normally sell
that kind of volume of shirts but we
also don't normally do limited edition
shirts and when we do they tend to sell
really well it's just it's kind of thing
we try not to overdo like that Tech
linked shirt with the tape I forget how
many units of that we move but it was
like so funny because the inspiration
for it really was just like yeah I
actually just like we didn't intend to
make it a shirt yeah until we were it
was like already created anyway well the
designs done so by the way while you're
at it if you want to grab the water
bottle we have more shipments coming in
three to four weeks I believe so there
you go
so I think that's pretty much it for
wind chill for today unless there's
anything else that you wanted to talk
through the entire Google i/o at all
oops hey at least we did our headline
topic we did we did a few seconds I
think we did a good third of the show on
tech news today and and it was
front-loaded do okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's just mostly not in the dock yeah no
that's good I guess good yeah no that's
fair I think yeah the Google i/o
happened Android q which some of this
stuff like I think everyone knew pixel
three a pixel 3/8 a Excel and Android Q
we're coming yeah there was some other
cool stuff one thing that I like is maps
AR I've seen that No
so like you'll be able to hold up your
screen mm-hm and like see the city and
it'll be like racing game style arrows
you might go this way and stuff and
that's pretty cool for when you're
walking around sometimes in cities it is
a little misleading because the I mean I
don't have a lot of trouble just seeing
the arrow but then again I'm not the
kind of person who puts spoons in the
fork tray so I can see why we need to
simplify walking down the street eating
in a dress number that's fair that's
very coming with
well I tend you know it's funny I tend
to be kind of a hater about like new
technology like I still don't have a
Google home or an Alexa or excuse me an
echo free and I used it for a little bit
and then unplugged it because it was
just annoying when I was trying to use
my phone's voice control stuff and I
realized something I was like going to
do something on my phone the other day I
was like oh a lot of people would do
this with voice control or something but
for me it is literally faster to just do
it myself but then I'm gonna pick on my
poor aunt again I love my aunt
dearly I was watching her use her phone
the other day and she's like trying to
key a destination into like Google Maps
or something I'm just completes you
don't even have to type the whole thing
my dad uses voice commands really
effectively and I use voice commands
almost exclusively to set alarms yeah
really fast yeah genuinely really fast
and it works basically all the time
setting reminders who knows what the
reminders gonna be for you know what I
hate about reminders it's such a gentle
nudge yes it's like yep and a lot of the
time the reminder won't even be the top
of things yeah
and if I'm standing next to it I wish
you know how when you're sitting at a
young reminder of some sort you can set
like oh I want a notification I want an
email there should be set an alarm off I
believe you can do that okay Google
sorry everyone set an alarm reminding me
to rotate the wash in ten minutes
no no more than 24 hours yeah nope I
think there's a way to I don't think you
can set an alarm for more than 24 hours
from now oh you might be right I think
there is a way to set an alarm with a
text thing though I can't remember how
to do it yeah but like I want every it's
a reminder I need to know like Jamie
yeah okay I had this thought the other
day that okay first of all SIM card
technology I wish was further than it is
now you should be able to have maybe I'm
totally off on this and just don't
nobody should feel they have more than
one phone number and I want a phone
number that I can have in my phone that
isn't my main phone number that's like
four floatplane stuff and if something
goes through that and I don't open that
text message or respond to that call my
phone needs to go nuclear just freak out
I don't care flash the light do tons of
noise vibrate like crazy and just don't
stop that's three four four hours if
anything that seems like the kind of
thing you could do with like if this
than that or something probably like I
just got a call on sim to then but like
I kind of went off the air there was a
way that I could like give you right one
of those phone numbers right so that you
could call the like this needs to get
frickin through phone number no is it
still a thing that you can make an
urgent call I don't know I know there
was a way to prioritize whether it was
text messages or calls I know there but
there wouldn't used to be a way to like
flag it I don't know if it was ever
widely supported I just know I'd seen it
on a couple of phones over the years
yeah I don't know but yeah I just wish
there was a way to like and I don't want
it to be overused so I would want it to
be a thing where like you have to give
someone access to this right whether
it's a phone number or whether it's
whatever
I wish there's a way that people as
higher priority contacts but the only
thing I think it affects is whether they
can punch through do not disturb and but
but that's and that's not enough that's
yeah and like I and I and I need you're
talking you want to wake up when you're
sleeping yes right and that's very I'm a
rather hard person to wake up and like
my freaking phone I hate this so much
you can't have your ringtone and your
notification tones on separate volume
levels really mine can don't quote me on
that though is that Samsung yeah yeah so
I believe Samson I can yeah and I think
there's some way to do it on non Samsung
devices but I don't I think there's way
to do it stock I think you have to root
or something right but that's just
ridiculous
and another part of the thing is most of
the phone
calls that I get are not important just
to be completely honor half of the ones
I get are span these days yeah exactly
so I don't actually want it to be super
annoying right
but right if someone has the special
like I don't know maybe call my phone
and then while it's ringing if you put
in a code be like nope this one's
important go through everything max
volume it go crazy it seems like the
kind of thing that should be possible
yeah speaking of possible so here's our
update are you interested in learning
about video creation think you can edit
an LTT video better than our team in an
hour we are actually doing this as a
booth so you can come to the editing den
booth show us your skills Taryn will be
on site to show you the ropes and help
answer your questions when you show up
there will be somewhere between 6 &amp;amp; 8
editing workstations loaded up with
Adobe Premiere and Photoshop yes you
have to edit with Adobe sorry along with
a roll footage and a combination of
b-roll Clips sound files and templates
will also be provided along with our ear
this way animated intro and end screen
and each station will have a timer
you'll have exactly one hour to put
together your wonderful creation will
record your name and contact info store
the video then review them about a week
after LTX is over to pick our winner the
winner will receive their very own video
editing workstation that's the birth
where I was like wow that's crazy
our TBD like to be clear it's not gonna
be like a Z on W 3175 X like so but
we're talking like an eight-core risin
you know 16 gives you like something
respectable it'll be something
respectable so that's gonna be pretty
cool if you're not all right if you
don't already have a ticket for LTX what
are you waiting for we announced some
new creators a snazzy Labs is coming now
yeah so like we're spending more money
fine
we're selling we're actually selling
enough tickets that it like actually
might be fine but no please buy more
tickets anyway yeah great it's a good
time then I think there was also one
more thing that I had wanted to alright
super chats okay I felt
so bad two weeks ago someone super
chatted $100 we got it last week - and
someone super chatted $100 again okay
well I felt bad two weeks ago I felt bad
last week well you were there two weeks
I was there on both streams so I just
wanted to jump in guys I did get in
touch with that person oh and did answer
their question okay even though I did
not catch them on stream hi just eaten
hi Robert Jr Nathan says there's
something on my shirt haha JK you guys
are just such a wonderful group so weird
oasis hi Zack hi David Cook hi it's fake
free Google money apparently thank you
for that and you want to do super chats
by the way if you don't have a
floatplane subscription you should do
that instead a higher percentage of it
actually makes it to us just so you know
well me not him but like because I
technically own well have ownership
stakes and both - Media Group and
floatplane it's pretty great like it's
it's better then you stripe cuz it's
just eaten yeah should we have talked
about PayPal being a bunch of butt heads
this week it's kind of a big topic I was
I was considering if we had the old
mixer here not the old mixer at the one
mixer we had that one with the square
button I was just gonna start the rant
and then get you to hold it for like two
or three minutes it has been a bad scene
and we were looking at seriously
de-emphasizing PayPal's presents
interesting site guess who's human
processor PayPal is now secondary for
weight I was are you gonna guess eBay
well I just couldn't remember who they
work the most closest like it was one of
those things on the tip my brain oh I
wanted to get it right I'm sorry but
maybe I'd have gotten it wrong anyway so
thank you for at least saving me the
embarrassment eBay though that's wow I
didn't know that
apparently this happened like a little
while ago huh I think this is
not actually super new news this was
sometime in 2018 but yeah one I don't
actually remember who sorry but one of
my guys brought it up in the meeting
today that never no BAE even
deprioritize PayPal like it's not that
it's still there but it's not their main
payment processor interesting wild
absolutely wild hi Jonathan Wade says
tech tips on top yeah sure
Ben says can you please talk about the
point pentathlon yeah there's been a
bunch of people talking about that in in
the full plain chat I was gonna bring it
up after the super chats but here yeah
let's keep going I'll bring this up
Landen says nice work you glorious
Kanaka stands yeah thank you
hi Jonathan Jung hi Jonathan Jung hi
Jonathan young Jonathan Young says are
y'all gonna make out or what Jake likes
tech says hey about the new rise of CPUs
I've had about three rise and chips in
the last year and a half and all of them
have had bad luck that's why I'm looking
to go Intel because they're better
chances I think you might mean with
respect to overclocking and it's not bad
luck and these current rise and chips
don't really overclock much yeah like
the lower tier ones will overclock to
like the same level as the higher tier
ones in a lot of cases but they don't
really go much further they have kind of
a hard wall intel has a hard wall to
it's just at a higher frequency because
that's intel's old got a little bit more
experience making decent CPUs right now
but Andy's catching up and bite more
experience I mean that is kind of an
underhanded jab at Intel to be very
clear to you guys to those of you who
put the forks in the spoon tray what I
mean is Intel hasn't like made a new CPU
architecture in four years so they've
had lots of time to tune it yeah Bambi
says fine this is thick that is gonna I
that is gonna be like my on going every
time I mentioned forks and spoons okay
yeah the people who watched this wine
show are gonna know what's up yeah Emily
says I'm the family IT girl I have
people I don't know coming to me to fix
their stuff
yeah I hear it Mikell says - you drink
his technology heck yeah it is
hey it's got a vacuum thing blah blah
blah LTTE store comm job ever you set
the alarm alarm I second okay Harold
asks is there zap replay prepay plan for
a year flow plane not yet we're working
on it you know and McCallum the pipe
just got the shirt
nice alright Oh Thomas says want to buy
floatplane forums again are we fixing
that sometime yeah so I have actually
posted that like you were aware like you
know but just getting the site ready for
other creators right now is a higher
priority because we've been losing money
for two and a half years yeah
so it's true we don't want to be like
motivated by money man you know like the
corporation's man but being negative is
also like that you have to get that sort
of pay people yeah and things so it in
don't worry it's fine that's there's
still money thank you thanks man but
also just like shit we should try to
hire more people Adsense so we can do
cool stuff
anyways the new transcript system is in
prod there's been some problems with it
but there's problems with everything
especially when it's something that's
been worked on for so long and it's
actually doing quite well and we're
patching it as it goes and we're
actually very happy with the new
transferring system and uploading system
in general so that's great that was one
of the big blocks that there was for
bringing on new creators a few things we
want to get into place since one of the
priorities that we have right now is
finishing the app which is very close to
completion like we've moved on to Apple
testing and are finishing off
notifications really we're kind of like
done cool there's there's more stuff
that's gonna be pretty high priority
once it's released
but it'll be pushed into a this is a
much better experience in the mobile app
kind of state the number one priority
probably after it's released will be
casting support but there was
technically ways that you can force it
yourself anyways yearly support a few
other cool payments updates and 4k
we'll all be things that are gonna be
coming relatively soon we're ready to
announce 4k okay okay
floatplane will be able to do 4k that's
where potentially having different tiers
will be a thing get a different pricing
tier to be honest with you guys the
reality of it is that hosting video
online is incredibly expensive there's a
reason that you can count on one hand
probably the profitable video platforms
on the internet like there's really not
many there's there's a lot more popping
up more recently especially with the
Disney thing and are they profitable
maybe not right yeah I mean the thing
with Disney is you could bacon would be
just a market share play they could make
the argument like its profitable because
like Star Wars is profitable and we use
some of that profits to make this online
streaming thing but that division is it
profitable yeah I have no idea but
anyways profitable I actually don't know
the last time I looked into it they were
losing but who knows and that could be
fun accounting anyways yes
so netflix is profitable cool good but
like I would wonder if Amazon Prime
video is profitable it seems kind of
hard for it to be given that it's just
included with your Prime members you
know they sent me physical mail telling
me to watch it cuz I like have a prime
account but I've never watched prime
video so they sent me a physical piece
of mail being like hey there's cool
shows you should watch it really that's
really weird guys lending you a DVD
catalog yeah this is pretty awkward but
anyways Columbia House anyway I think
we're done for the wine show for today
wait boink pentathlon 2019 I would
