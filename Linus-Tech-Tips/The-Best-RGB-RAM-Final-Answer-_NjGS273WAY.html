ed and you wear your RGB pride on your
sleeve
some of you our closet RGB lovers hiding
your secret passion under the blanket
some of you couldn't be more different
from those people some of you hate RGB
you call it pointless stupid cancer but
whether you're sitting there ready to
throw your wallet at your screen or your
pull mat your forehead there's one thing
you all have in common right now a
burning curiosity about who makes the
best RGB computer memory on the market
and I have the answer
synergy is the amazing software that
lets you share your mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers check it out
now at the link in the video description
for a company whose copy/paste game is
so weak that their website actually
contains references to cool channel
memory the marketing spin on Geils Evo X
is actually very good they boast that
their H ilm approach enables dynamic RGB
lighting without any performance or
stability penalty because it separates
the RGB lighting components from the
rest of the PCB and their use of a
standard 4 pin connector means across
the board
get it compatibility with software
lighting control across any cpu type
motherboard or even breakout control box
like the ones cable mod includes with
their cased lighting kits and they even
include four basic presets on a little
switch if you want to power it from the
other side of the module off a 9 volt or
a 12 volt fan header all of that makes a
lot of sense in my mind so I get hey
wait a minute this is just an RGB strip
taped to a normal Ram module I mean they
couldn't even get the thing to fit on
there straight and that ignores that you
will need power or 4 pin RGB leads
running to every individual module a
cable management nightmare
what the Evo X does have going for it is
that top to bottom deals line up passes
the Rd savings directly to the consumer
coming in by far the cheapest out of all
our RGB Ram with a wide range of
capacities and speeds available though
only a handful of them were in stock at
Newegg Corsairs Vengeance RGB ddr4
represents a significant
up in cost but in return you get a whole
lot more product development
they not only custom-built their modules
to allow the RGB lights to be powered
directly from the memory slot but they
actually built their RGB controller with
storage that allows you to change your
lighting effects through the OS the
memory section of link isn't especially
comprehensive but I'd say most of the
important bases are covered
breathing pulsing shifting and delay
adjustments for dim to dim animations
with brightness adjustments apparently
coming soon and Corsair gets credit for
learning from their experience launching
the k70 RGB keyboard it's really easy to
use this time another nice touch is that
Corsair allows you to flip your light
bar cover so that the logos are all
aligned on x99 boards overall
compatibility is pretty darn good with
both MSI mystic flare and gigabyte RGB
fusion working on Intel and supported in
beta on raiven though that doesn't fully
make up for the product lineup that's
limited to 8 gig module or the lack of
support for Asus RS Inc especially when
you consider the price parity with G
skills equivalent spec try to Z RGB kids
this stuff is banaynays they managed to
power the RGB lighting effects through
the dims lot just like Corsair
they worked evidently with a soos as far
as I can tell on their comprehensive RGB
lighting control software the interface
is nearly identical to ara and they
threw in individually addressable LEDs
to take their swagger to a whole other
level so you can run breathing pulsing
flashing rainbow effects and so much
more on individual dim
or synched up between multiple ones the
software is all still beta and
programming it is a little unintuitive
and tedious but it's pretty darn
rewarding as long as you've got a
compatible system Intel and AMD are
supported on a seuss with MSI as rock
and gigabyte support still pending but
to their credit they have a huge variety
of products available all the way up to
thirty six hundred megahertz high
density kits with sixteen gig dims that
is to say if you're willing to pay more
than twice what Geel charges for their
RGB kits on a per gig basis so bottom
line then GL solution while not much of
an engineering step up from gluing in
our gb strip to the top of your memory
module is inexpensive and boasts the
strongest compatibility with older
systems and off-the-shelf
lighting control kits g.skill is the
most feature-rich but relies on more
limited platform support for anything
but the stock rainbow wave animation and
Corsair strikes a fine balance between
broader compatibility and eliminating
cable clutter so the answer then to a
big question as usual is I guess it
depends do you need both a Mac and a PC
for the different tasks that you do or
do you have your own home computer and a
work assigned laptop that you need to
use at the same time well forget about
having two keyboards and two mice that's
stupid
synergy allows you to share one mouse
and keyboard between two or more
computers so you'll no longer get
confused about which keyboard or mouse
is for which and it even works across
multiple operating systems Windows Mac
and Linux there's a basic and a pro
version with one-time payment and
lifetime access to features like a
clipboard that shares between the
computers dragging and dropping files
between the computers the ability to set
up hotkeys and more you can use our link
