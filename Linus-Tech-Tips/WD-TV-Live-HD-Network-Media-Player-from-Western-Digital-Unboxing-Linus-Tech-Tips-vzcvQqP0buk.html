gonna be having a look at the WD TV live
and basically the only difference
between the WD TV live and the original
WD TV is that this one comes with
networking support so what that means is
you're going to be able to plug it in
via ethernet cable and stream media over
the network so let's have a look at the
supported formats you've got your normal
stuff here so it's supporting all of
your avi formats all of the important
stuff which would be things like MKV and
windows media all that good stuff now
they've added a couple other things
first of all you have support for DTS
2.0 digital output and I think you can
probably see all of the other pertinent
logos here we're not going to look too
closely at this let's get the unit
pulled out here so their marketing
basically says yeah you can turn any USB
Drive into an HD media player that
includes hard drive so let's break the
seals here and get this unboxing
underway so inside the box we will find
a fairly similar package I'm guessing to
what we saw with the original WD TV
which I did open at some point but I
didn't actually do an unboxing video on
so first of all here are the contact
numbers for your warranty so that's
bright orange so you can't possibly miss
it that's really good okay so then the
WD TV live media player so this is your
QuickStart guide so it unfolds into
about a poster size piece of paper here
shows you all the accessories that comes
with and how to plug in for standard
definition versus high definition also
what not to do okay so that's pretty
straightforward and see what's on the
back is a bunch of FCC kind of nonsense
but nobody will ever read but it's got
to be there so then we have the WD d WD
TV live CD insert into computer cd-rom
drive so that's should be pretty easy to
do this is the discovery software so
that's how the WD TV media player is
gonna actually find your software now
here we have the remote which is almost
identical to or might be identical to
the remote included with the original WD
TV it's a fairly basic remote but it's
got all the functionality that you
absolutely need
it's powered by a couple of triple-a
batteries
so make sure that you oh man I can't
believe that guy's starting his car he's
like about a hundred meters away from me
I swear right now that thing is so loud
I hope he doesn't drive past ok let's
get the WD TV itself oh let's just break
the seal there so it's a very very small
unit as per the original one now this is
a hardware solution so you're not doing
any kind of emulated junk this has got a
real HD decoding chipset on it here's
your first USB port so this is the
conveniently located one on the side so
you'd throw like a USB Drive or a hard
drive or whatever in there if you want
to use it on the fly now in the back you
can plug something in permanently and
that's a much better solution if you
have something you're gonna keep
attached to it all the time
here's your HDMI out as well as your
optical audio out and here not present
on the original WD TV is your Ethernet
port here we've got a vo and here is our
high-def RGB here's the power plug and
then let's have a look at the other side
you can see there's actually some
ventilation ports here that's gonna be
quite important for making sure that the
chipset stays nice and cool so there's
the unit itself now let's have a look at
the accessory as it comes with so first
of all you get some new leader triple-a
batteries to go with your remote that's
great then you get the power plug so
let's get this out of the box here and
it comes with some other piece of paper
in it
asian power that's that's kind of
ominous
oh no sorry my bad asian power devices
Inc so read the safety instructions you
might want to do that so it's just a
regular wall wart and it plugs into the
back of the unit where we saw four
cables that are included the first cable
we see here is the composite out so this
is just that plugs into the jack on the
back here the a/v out one don't use the
RGB out for that one there we go
and then for our other output option
really realistically you should be using
the HDMI out if you're buying this unit
anyway this is an HD device yes you can
use it for standard def but it's a
little bit overkill for that and I mean
that said it's pretty reasonably priced
so there's not much cheaper so there
is your component out so thank you for
