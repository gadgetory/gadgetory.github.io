whatsoever Samsung was recently here in
Richmond for the tech fair and they left
behind a couple of their notebooks so I
figured what the hey we might as well
have a look at them right here in front
of me I have the 530 you four and the
five thirty you three these are a 13.3
inch and 14 inch models respectively
from Samsung's three series of notebooks
so while this is not necessarily the
same kind of uber premium that you're
going to see on something like a samsung
9 series which we also did an unboxing
of their nine series ultrabook it's
still pretty respectable when it comes
to the form factor as well as the
battery life so let's start with d530
you for which is this guy right here
this guy has up to a one terabyte drive
depending on the configuration you go
with and what's cool about is it
includes a 16 gig hiya SSD that they're
using intel SRT technology in order to
accelerate the storage on I'm a huge fan
of SRT technology so I'm really glad to
see that included in terms of the
overall I oh oh right 14 inch screen
which is running at 1366 x 768
resolution in terms of I oh you got your
power you got your hinged Ethernet port
very cool two USB 3.0 ports vga hdmi and
a combo headphone microphone jack out
and on the other side you have an
optical drive which is tough in this
kind of a form factor USB 2 as well as
an SD card reader nothing really that
sort of special on the bottom of the
unit I don't know why I was expecting to
find anything there on the top you got
speakers your standard sort of chiclet
keyboard as well as a shirley large
trackpad we have dedicated left and
right buttons this piece right here is
actually made of aluminum which is kind
of nice because it means it's less prone
to wearing out and looking really gross
although not as not as good at that as
glass which we saw in one of the recent
HP Envy notebooks that we took a look at
got your webcam and that's pretty much
it so stepping down to the 530 you three
model this one doesn't have an optical
drive so you still see two USB 2.0 ports
an SD card reader on the other side you
got your hinged Ethernet power USB
three HDMI as well as a combo audio port
and one of those adapted vga ports
you'll have to buy the adapter if you
want to use that but at least you have
the option the u3 is actually a little
bit thinner than the you for now they
both have what samsung says is brighter
than normal screens so these are 300
knit screens and they're both using dual
core ulv processors oh another cool
thing now compared to most entry-level
notebooks these days which are using
glossy screens these are both using
matte finish screens now the the you for
comes with an HP 75 50m graphics card
whereas the u3 comes with intel
integrated HD graphics and it also
doesn't have the hybrid SSD hard drive
thing going on for it either let's just
see if there's anything sort of okay
yeah I don't know why I did that again
wasn't really expecting to find anything
there both of them have aluminum tops
that look quite nice and I think that
pretty much covers it so this is
basically what you would look like
carrying around oh oh you know what here
I should show you guys so it's in sleep
mode now this is uh is pretty cool it
wakes up really really fast I wonder if
the battery died who's actually give me
a second here guys so yeah my bad guys
this laptop is not set for whatever
reason um this was used in the trade
shows as possible someone was playing
around with it to come out of sleep when
you open the lid so i'm going to show
you guys how quickly it resumes from
sleep now there it takes that long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
