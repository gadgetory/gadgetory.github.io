triple 4k monitor gaming system they
showed off earlier this year at CES we
all heard the rumors that I stole it
from their booth during cleanup at the
show but I'm gonna let you guys in on a
little secret I didn't steal it
in fact I wouldn't even want it because
truth be told I've been working on my
own triple monitor portable
battlestation laptop concept for the
last 20 minutes that I call Ruiz our
project bullerby and I'm going to show
you guys exactly how it works
HP's new omen ex lineup comes equipped
with Intel seventh generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description alright so first
things first and I assure you that my
decision to use a razor blade Pro as the
basis of my pre jock has nothing to do
with the fact that razor also did the
same thing with their project so mines a
pre jock there's a project no similarity
whatsoever is to start with the razor
blade Perot as a basis it's already a
fairly portable battle station class
computer with a core i7 6700 k GT X 1080
graphics 32 gigs of RAM PCIe raid 0 SSDs
pretty much you how my finger is stuck
freaking name it I'm not a huge fan of
the keyboard but that's ok
ok so what was good about Project
Valerie it was self contained as a
single unit so you could just slide it
into your backpack as one piece I mean
sort of they didn't actually have any of
that stuff working yet when we were
there the like one that was supposed to
kind of like go out and then fold in
that was all fixed in place just as kind
of a of a mock-up and the number two is
it was truly portable so the idea was
that sure it was pretty thick but it
could be taken with you set up in the
local Starbucks and run in either single
monitor mode so without folding out the
additional displays or in triple monitor
mode without requiring being plugged
into the wall so my plan is actually to
use a solution that I brought up during
my show coverage of razors take on this
by using portable USB powered monitors I
mean sure I may give up some of the
elegance of not having everything fold
together but I have the advantage of not
needing to carry my two extra monitors
out with me when I don't intend to use
them okay we're gonna get started on
construction in a minute but first let's
have a look at the monitors we're using
so these are made by a company called G
chic we've actually covered one of their
products before but this is a new one
this is the on lap 1503 H and other than
being like portable it's basically a
monitor so you got your buttons on the
side you've got HDMI and VGA in
unfortunately using proprietary ports
but they did send me pretty much all the
cables I could possibly need as well as
their dock connector that goes on the
back for one of them so all of that
should be pretty straightforward for our
project and it's powered right with this
USB type-c connector right down here on
the bottom left now normally the idea
would be that you mount it using the
included metal stand and rubber magnet
thing on the back but of course we have
other plans okay so if everything seemed
really well planned out and structured
about this video up until now that's
because I had a plan this is the part
where for the first time I actually
attempt to to do this
I am so here we go in order to keep the
i/o on the side of the monitor out of
the way of my mounting strategy which I
have not yet determined what it will
actually be so these are like they're
pretty light but they definitely do have
some hefty to them and thank you maybe I
could take off this metal bracket see if
I can save a little bit of weight there
on one of them I'm going to be using
their dock connector so the one that
mounts on the right side of the monitor
kind of unfortunate how freaking long
the cables are on
this so you can see right there we don't
need to have any cables sticking out of
it so we can go like that like like like
that okay then on the other one I can
use the cables that were included in the
box because they only sent me one of
those dock adapters okay so cables
here we go so we plug in the proprietary
HDMI and our power in with the objective
then of running that puppy right there
yeah boy okay so what I can't do with
the bracket here is have these monitors
sit in front of the laptop so it looks
like these are going to have to go on
from the back and because of the length
of these cables I think I'm actually
going to be better off having the dock
adapter one on this side and then the
other one see what the cables coming off
here on the other side and wrapping them
around sort of maybe oh no problem no
problem we got this so all I need to
figure out now is what type of mounting
strategy I want to use we got tuck tape
we got gaff tape which I'm already
pretty sure isn't going to work we've
got double sided velcro tape and we've
got this badass 3m adhesive that we use
for our GoPros now this and tuck tape
have the disadvantage of not being very
removable how you saying so I'm gonna
try and make this work
with this velcro stuff let's see how it
goes
now obviously given that these monitors
actually have mounting points on them
like screw mounting points if Jake was
here I could have him whip up something
on the 3d printer or something but it's
me so double sided tape Fraser is going
to be super stoked on getting this
laptop back with like velcro all over it
this stuff leaves a wicked residue so
it's actually kind of moment of truth
time here what kind of angle do we want
let's go with that give me some guidance
here man okay actually here you know
what it's just there like that wah oh
boy okay here we go
so theoretically you need two USB plugs
for power for this sucker but I have had
them working with just one so let's see
if waiting for it yeah all right we got
one one monitor working now it's time to
apply what we learned which is nothing
of course to the other side okay
oh yeah I think it's gonna survive do
you even lift razor blade Pro yeah boy
yeah you do now we just kind of plug
this one in and do note that there's
still a USB port available on the left
side for your USB plugging needs you
know your mouse your thumb drive and the
second HDMI output provided by the
Fuengirola port because what project
wouldn't be complete without a dongle in
today's world so the Thunderbolt port
gives us our second HDMI and
come on where's my cursor the computer
just crashed oh yeah there it is
look at that working perfectly
DIY project Valerie the cursor moves
seamlessly from one to the next and we
have achieved the goals that we set out
to achieve so goal number one triple
monitors on a laptop and goal number two
the ability to Albee it with some
additional bulk take our completely
cable list solution no need to be
plugged into the wall and easily easily
easily oh did that panel just break oh
this one's fine mm-hmm easily take it
with us on the go in one compact package
so thanks for watching guys I hope you
enjoyed this fun little video on DIY
project Valerie now obviously I fully
understand that this is not a very
elegant solution but the point of this
video in much the same way that razors
video was more about the concept of
triple monitor laptops the point of this
video was the concept of portable multi
monitor solutions and where they could
go in the future what I'd like to see is
especially with USB type-c and its
incredible power delivery
characteristics I'd like to see a beefy
Thunderbolt port that could power two of
these monitors that are kind of daisy
together across the back off of a single
port or something like that I would be
super cool and as on you may remember
them from such incidents as kicking us
out of their associates program but
we're back and they're still awesome we
