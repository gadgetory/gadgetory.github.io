vendor to do a USB thumb drive review
and I'm like yeah but every once in a
while the product notes will say
something outlandish like SSD
performance now in convenient travel
size and I kind of go okay send it over
so here we are welcome to my video about
the Flash Voyager GTX from Corsair the
jazz mini phone and tablet stand from
coolermaster is now available in a
variety of cool colors from these great
retailers click now to learn more now
it's no secret than a USB thumb drive in
an SSD you're not fundamentally that
different there's an interface like SATA
or USB there's a controller chip and
there's NAND flash so why does comparing
the performance of an SSD to your
typical USB Drive feel about like
pitting Batman against a one-legged dog
in a cage match what are the actual
differences great question first up is
flash chip quality better NAND is faster
and lost four more right cycles but is
also much more expensive second is
parallelization SSDs have more flash
ships to read from and write to and
accessing more chips at the same time
within a drive is kind of like accessing
more drives at a time in raid zero
within a PC and third is controller
complexity SSD controllers are much
faster and use more advanced reading and
writing algorithms to coax the best
possible performance and longevity out
of the attached flash so that third
point is what course are changed they
went and put an SSD controller in this
thumb drives attractive metal housing
with a little cap on and stuff because
while capacities for these drives of
increased dramatically over the past few
years
this one's 256 gigs performance has it
scaled in quite the same fashion so that
massive amount of storage that you can
carry around in your back pocket becomes
impractical for large files anyway
because it takes so long to copy them
back and forth ok then so how does this
one perform than Linus well great
question again we did three different
real-world tests a single 6 gig file
transfer a one gig single file transfer
a multi file transfer above through two
thousand one megabyte photos and the
answer is about as expected for very
small files the better controller gives
the Voyager GTX a real edge on more
traditional drives in terms of write
speeds but makes less of a difference
for reads with our medium-sized single
file test we noticed that it's got this
weird fast bursting behavior that
allowed it to read a one gig file faster
than we could even start and stop the
timer and then write at pretty much the
same speed as our SSD leaving a more
traditional even performance oriented
USB 3 Drive behind and hanging right up
there with an SSD and finally in our
large file test the Voyager GTX landed
squarely between the other options for
writes and much closer to the SSD for
reads making the conclusion for this
drive actually very straightforward is
it as fast as an SSD no not exactly but
it's still super cool and if you want to
carry a bunch of data around with you in
a form factor that's more convenient
than an SSD on a dongle but less
convenient perhaps than a slim drive
that doesn't interfere with the
surrounding ports then the Voyager gtx
is your middle ground in terms of the
actual size and shape as well as in
terms of performance thanks for watching
guys like or dislike the video according
to your feelings as always the link to
the pricing for this product is in the
video description along with a link to
our forum where you can discuss it away
from the typical youtube comment
rigmarole and also in the video
description is a support link you can
buy a cool t-shirt like this one become
