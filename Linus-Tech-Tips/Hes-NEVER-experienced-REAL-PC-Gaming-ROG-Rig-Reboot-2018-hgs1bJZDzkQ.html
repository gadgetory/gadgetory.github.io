an interesting one
our final contestant for our G rigged
reboot 2018 or rather our final winner
Chris here had only one request through
this machine wireless internet that's it
that's the one special request well
hopefully Asus managed to send over a
board with Wi-Fi because tough series
boards didn't use to have it oh they did
cool well we're off to the races then
aren't we that's what the blow-up
what are you wearing
little TT hoodie and lt team t-shirt
actually Chris I forgot to show you the
best part of my ensemble today
everyone's been complaining about my
socks and sandals so I agreed finally to
switch to sandals and bare feet Oh
bare bare feet so have you ever built a
computer before yes really so this will
be easy-peasy go ahead and get started
do it okay I got the case open first
yeah I do not like my method panel do
the motherboard it's a free country no
it's a free country even though I'm
gonna make sure I got to be judgmental
right now how would you go back then I
don't know you don't seem like you care
you seem like you just want to forge
your own path and so far be it for me to
to interfere with whatever it is
whatever this is what kind of system you
built before I have some old like
Windows XP computers like early 2000s oh
wow okay so first of all never open
anything overtop of the socket just in
case you drop your board yeah so you
drop enough things you start to come up
with mitigation strategies yeah that's
good so what are we loading in here 9700
K how do you pull this off did he end up
with the best CPU
oh it's cuz he got to go last that's the
secret
yeah yeah hey eight core chip man nice
sorry you were having trouble getting
the Box open right okay I'm gonna show
you a secret technique for getting past
these seals that's been handed down by
my unboxing floor fathers
oh just so just go around it yeah like
if there's a detour you just drive
around yeah so you put it in the 2280
socket here or at least you try you just
scrape it around on the board for a bit
and then yeah go ahead yeah yeah yeah
grab grab a socket there find the right
size nope too small
ah so there we go we've got our MDOT to
drive we've got our CPU what would you
think comes next old-timey chapman we
put the motherboard into the computer
just like no foreplay graphics let's put
the graphics card on now and then just
put it in there with no power supply no
power supply the RAM yes let's look
around
okay so if I and ran blast so you know
what's cool you actually ended up with
the coolest lamb - this is the Trident z
royal heck yeah okay alright how does
RAM doing well normally there we go nice
he's done round before the Hat is kind
of blingy to the point of ridiculous and
it is like RG beat up the but what would
you like to do now I'm going off my
first impulse and say the power supply
so these are your custom individually
sleeved cable mod cables and once you
get those sorted out then we can plug
them into your power supply okay molex
cable ah that's what I think okay then
have you considered the possibility that
you're done Oh
done I got more cables oh you seem so
stressed out man don't it's expensive
nothing can go wrong okay put your
cables on first it's a lot easier to put
them on now than to try and find angle
them in in there what's facing up it
this would be the clothes I need to I oh
shoot we may have a small issue houston
all right Chris so there appears to be
to have been a small error in your favor
you were already getting basically the
bang inist gaming computer and it's just
gonna get a little bit more bangin
because we're gonna have to go with an
ROG motherboard here because your case
has one of these connectors so these are
designed for high data rates and high
power delivery such as is needed for USB
type-c ports so you know I'm just gonna
do a quick swap here for the components
that we have installed so far that's a
pretty nice upgrade yeah yeah right why
I've been installing Ram
since before I look born I'm gonna need
a minute oh but I dress older than you
so that's okay you gonna be alright
yeah I'm fine no I'm good okay now I
feel really old today Colt and think
you're only as old as you act how about
that where the chuffing hell is the i/o
shield for the oh it's one of the ones
with the built-in I okay it's fine
okay so now I really wish you hadn't
exploded the packaging for this
motherboard do we need like a clean-up
session like a montage no it's gonna be
fine because it's gonna be Colton's
problem oh and he's gone
there is not a lot of clearance here
yeah we are going to have to take the
fan out in order to install this
motherboard wow that's a tight fit it's
snug like a bug yeah okay it goes in but
the tolerances on this case could be
better you know what I'm just gonna do
these times faster I'll hand you screws
helpful that way one job Chris one job I
drop things almost as much as you do
nothing to be proud of you could be my
real bed all right so the motherboards
in I'm gonna say put the SSD into its
holster like a Texan this gonna be your
everyday carry SSD yeah but I can't take
it in to work not allowed are you sure
you don't have a knife
mmm see I thought those were fake no
real fake knives
you don't need regular and it real
knives when you got real thick knives
you got fake fruit there's no way that
you could do this any worse than our
last winner
it's is this a challenge and okay
okay I lied that it is possible for you
to be as bad at this is the other guy
and you know no doing amount it like
that after looking at I'm like oh I see
where I am just growing up that's
screwing it yeah that's good
I'll get there in the end it starts with
you know Lincoln Park yeah of course I
do
he knows Lincoln Park right maybe you
are an old soul Chuck no check my phone
you'd see a lot of old times on there
just call it an old song oh if it's if
it's from two people about to say if
it's from two thousand or earlier it was
old okay you're right this is what he
was about to say are you because that's
before he was born
it's instinct would you consider in sync
and old band I am actually going to see
the Backstreet Boys I am so excited
they're coming to Vancouver next summer
nice oh really yeah I got it
I'm not even ashamed I'm into it PSB BS
video this cooler is pretty cool so
aside from just being like ASA tech
built dual 120 millimeter blah blah blah
it has a screen on it mmm
the tell me of the temperatures it can
okay I can tell you whatever you want it
can curse at you if you'd like aw sweet
this is a little tricky and I don't
expect you to know the right way to do
it we just want to check our orientation
here to make sure that so that's gonna
be probably how we want to put that on
you know what I'm just gonna pop it on
there for you so what's the highest spec
Windows XP computer you've built it has
a GT 210
okay well that's a graphics card at
least the processor is a Pentium 4 de
3.0 by the time you have a pentium d in
the machine it doesn't matter how many
gigahertz it is really it's more of a
space heater to be honest yeah ok cool
is in looking good
what's next I guess that needs to be
turn around then for cable management in
the back mmm
would you like LT t hook and loop
fastener ties sure they're just like
regular cable ties except they say LT T
on them I'm just gonna replace those
built-in cable ties for you there it's a
nice decent quality LT t one's decent
quality more secure I'd say we're not
saying they're the best we're just
saying they're fine they're functional
wow this is coming together now ok yeah
we can do the graphics card if you want
alright this is it the scariest part
this is the RT x 2080 - what do you mean
scariest part this is fun yeah except
fastest gaming card known to man
OC edition 11 gigs of GDD are 6 memory
this is probably more GDD r 6 memory
than you have in your life of any kind
of memory well unless you cut my memory
drawer that's part bad this is as good
as it gets and your timing for this
build it just keeps getting better
battlefield 5 finally just dropped with
art CX enabled to type fixed bucks
oh thank you don't drop it I know that's
why I said this is the scariest part
this I don't have a replacement on hand
for and also this is more expensive than
any computer I've on leave it alone
so yep have a quick you can do here
don't you do that oh I got stuck okay
gonna bend that back for you there buddy
just take care of that there for you
right there
and oh and now it fits just for that I'm
gonna peel your graphics card no I'm not
gonna do that I'm not gonna do that
I wouldn't do that I wouldn't feel
another nice graphics cards go for it go
for it after all this practice awful oh
wow two-handed people well oh my
goodness this is I think this is the
worst level of chaos out of any of these
buildings is this Wireless nope also you
can decide if you want a braided cable
or a regular cable good because braided
cables I'm gonna go with regular because
braided are heavier and drag fascinating
so I had just said on our last our G rig
reboot why would anyone not choose the
braided cable because the braided cable
has more drag to it and it's a heavier
cable so looking good I'm liking the
old-timey hat with the brand-new that's
how I do things look Steven a home Emily
yeah have you ever owned a DisplayPort
anything I owned a 1080p monitor that
had a DisplayPort option but I never had
a display port on the computer
well this monitor has more than just
DisplayPort this thing is a hundred and
sixty five Hertz 2560 by 1440 resolution
g-sync and in the other corner nothing
that nothing stands against it okay yeah
no this is
basically as banging as it gets for
gaming I think you'll be able to tell
that it's really fast and really clear
have you ever experienced greater than
60 Hertz display miss the highest I have
seen is 70 something so I just enabled
overclocking for this monitor
so that'll get you from 144 to 165 Hertz
boom there it is but to stay on my
favorite game
- wicket oh the mouse you can mine sweep
like nobody ever minds but you can see
exactly when the clock changes its
number each of these only borders of one
so it's either here and here or it's
just one of these and it's both of these
no I'm gonna take 50:50 guess and go
with wait you don't have to I do I not
this one here yeah which means that's
clear which means that's clear - oh yes
alright that means these fear clear not
that one no one over that that and that
yep it's a real game I'll have you know
mmm ok ok so in typical Call of Duty
fashion people are running around on the
battlefield with swords each other
alright how are you liking it
how's it feel much better especially on
the graphics apartment I don't even
think I could play this game on my old
computer how's the smoothness very
smooth even though I'm not used to
sensitivity I'd smooth enough that I can
see and stop myself I can't see that I'd
be playing competitively but I'm a lot
of fun
no no no the dog stuff you got dogged
shot of like three times look I get such
a kick out of this or sinks like hey
you're playing Cod yeah it's always did
you just die yeah nice turns red when
you die
I'm a ragequit this is my first rate to
put on this computer I'm upset yeah wait
no how's your kill to death ratio
oh right quick it was a round one to one
ish I think you were a little bit below
but I don't blame me if you're not used
to the sensitivity you can get that
dialed in though that you has tons of
dpi adjustments and we're back to your
regular color scheme now that's that's
pretty cool so that's it guys if you
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like I
get subscribe leave a massive shadow to
ASUS ROG in the comments below because
without their support this would not
have happened this year we've now given
away a total of six top-of-the-line
gaming rings over the last couple of
years and I would love to keep it going
so give them lots of love in the
comments below and while you're down
there you can check out the video
description where we'll have links to
where to check out all this great ROG
gear until next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
