1300 / n900 dual band extreme
performance wireless router now when
Buffalo says extreme performance what
they mean by extreme performance is as
Extreme as it freaking gets when it
comes to wireless so this is a Wi-Fi
router it is 80 2.11 AC which is
completely different from 80 2.11 a 80
2.11 be g and n this is significantly
faster so this guy is capable of up to
1.3 gigabits per second remember
whenever we're talking wireless
performance we're talking theoretical
performance and the real world it'll be
less but this this theoretical
performance is definitely faster than
your old theoretical performance I can
tell you that much for sure so that is
with ultra-fast wireless 11ac 900
megabit per second simultaneous
dual-band wireless 11n so that means
dual concurrent 450 megabit per second
streams even if you're using older
wireless and equipment with it however
if you pair it up with newer wireless AC
equipment you will get screaming fast
theoretically gigabit wireless
connectivity which is up until now
completely unheard of when it comes to
the consumer space anyway so it comes
with a fairly 400 I love these Ethernet
cables I have we have one of these in
the tech tips room from when we did from
when we showcased a buffalo product in
the past these are like they're sexy
ribbon cable Ethernet cables very nice
those are the kinds of accessories that
I get excited about these days I guess I
mean I'm also excited about the you know
1.3 gigabit per second wireless
performance but okay let's cover more of
what buffalo has to say for themselves
before we move along so it's dual then
2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz gigabit
ethernet USB port for storage and it's
also multi-platform pc mac or mobile
devices are all supported and they darn
well better be okay operating and oh
right so AC is different for men it
doesn't operate on
2.4 gigahertz at all now in theory 5
gigahertz is a bit of a range impediment
compared to 2.4 gigahertz however the
advantage of it is that there is
significantly less interference on the 5
gigahertz band so while you bit from a
wireless n 5 gigahertz router you get
even more from a dedicated 5 gigahertz
Wireless AC router so moving right along
also right I mean better antenna
technology better transmission power is
also going to compensate somewhat for
the reduced range of the five gigahertz
band operating in ok transfer speeds up
to ideal and interrupt HD video
streaming concurrent engine access it's
amazing i mean i can't wait for 1300
megabit per second internet access yeah
yeah all right 24-7 tech support in USA
in canada only three year warranty on
this guy right here and we've got all of
the usual stuff right here including
what it concludes the wireless the wired
interface so of course it's gigabit
which it sort of better be if it's going
to be like yeah i mean if it's going to
be capable of gigabit on the wireless
side then it better be gigabit wired to
because that only reason alright so
let's see what they've included all it's
kind of a neat looking I mean looking
brighter casing okay hello so air
navigator is their connector CD I've
actually found in my experience I know I
usually say throw away the CD but I
found router connector sees can actually
be kind of useful if you're not techy
and knowledgeable so if you you know by
the router for someone you can tell them
to use it also comes with a colored
quick set-up guide shows you how to plug
the thing into the thing and the other
thing and switch the thing on as well as
up look at that a couple quick tips
about about setting up the SSID setting
up the key it's nice to have a handy
dandy reference sheet I would probably
take something like this and like tape
it to the unit because that's what i
usually do with the information that I
need connection guide for Android
devices oh look at that trying to be
very complete about things warranty
statement regulatory compliance and
supplemental information hmm fascinating
okay so let's have a look at what
they've got in terms of included
accessories screw brackets a couple
mounting pujas so it looks like these
guys going here like
mmm-hmm this would be my guess okay can
you still no I get it I get it I get it
okay yeah so these clip in right here if
you do want to stand the rotor up
there's little guides on the inside so
you can see that right there just like
that and then it will stand without
falling over so the unit itself has a
soft touch rubberized finish on it that
actually looks play nice you've got
Buffalo's Air Station branding right
about there on that side and right about
there on the other side they thought a
plastic piece that goes around the top
of it kind of like it looks kind of like
um like Macky you know like with the
sort of aluminum II metally looking
piece going around the outside of a
black thing like kind of like an iPad or
something it's my tablet the air station
on the front we've got our connectivity
indicators we've also got an illuminated
Buffalo logo and moving around to the
back we find our four gigabit lan our
internet jack as well as our let's kind
of neat our on/off switch so you don't
actually have to unplug it to power
cycle the router should you need to do
it as well as our power input our USB
USB port an eject button for the safe
ejection of it and a router button let's
figure out what that does give me sec
guys apparently on the entire internet
information does not exist about what
this button does but what I suspect it
does is this a hardware button to change
from router mode to just wireless access
points which mode which would be really
useful because then you can take your
existing setup plug this thing in hit
the button it's not going to create any
conflicting IP address assignments
anything like that it'll just get you
going as quickly as possible also we
found something cool here's a card in
the bottom of the unit that tells you
all your default information without
taping things to the side of it which is
pretty cool as well there's a reset
button on the bottom which if you want
to reset the unit you're going to want
to hold that down that'll reset it back
to factory defaults and in terms of
included accessories we've got our power
brick I think we already covered this
didn't we so I think that pretty much
wraps it up now right now there aren't
really any AC devices so what's the
point of an AC router it's a draft 2
point 0 standard at this point in time
so why do you need this gigabit wireless
speed well buffalo has
a companion product so this is the the
AC 1300 this is the dual band media
bridge so it has four gigabit ports and
then this guy right here is basically
like a huge network card think of it
that way like it's a huge external Wi-Fi
dongle so that means you can connect
just one device by gigabit ethernet to
this guy right here and then you're
going to get your 1.3 gigabit per second
theoretical between these two devices
and then full gigabit connectivity
between this guy and whatever computer
or device is connected to or up to four
devices at a time given that there
should be bandwidth to spare the router
itself includes all the usual features
into things like Kos so you can
prioritize certain things like media
streaming or gaming so that you don't
get any leg and I think that pretty much
covers it thank you for checking out our
unboxing and first look at their AC 1300
dual bed extreme performance wireless
router from Buffalo and don't forget to
