scientist bring it on Logan
okay that's okay I got it this time
come on oh hey um could I have like a
lunch break or something
I've been working for like 16 hours I
think so
yeah I'm honestly I'm dog-tired too I
mean it feels like I've been feels like
I've been reviewing this footage for
hours but you know what it's worth it if
we pull together we could do this we
just gotta hang in there yeah okay yeah
I'll get it done
Hey
yeah sorry about that yeah I'm back now
okay let's just get back into this no
I'm just kidding guys
I'm doing actual work I'm not just
playing games on the job I've been
coordinating this collaborative giveaway
with Logan from text into kids so we
have a gaming prize pack for you guys
and all you have to do for a chance to
win is comment on this video subscribe
to Linus tech tips comment on Logan's
video over on tech syndicate and
subscribe to tech syndicate
now I understand that we're asking you
to do an awful lot of things for a
chance to win this gaming prize pack so
what exactly are we giving away the
answer is oh you guys are gonna love
this a copy of battlefield 4 for Xbox
360 followed by the no I'm just kidding
it's a PC gaming prize pack guys so we
have a battle-tested Galaxy GeForce GTX
670 this is the one that was actually
used in our benchmarking so it was
fairly lightly used over the you know
year and whatever that we've had it
definitely fully functional we have also
got a Corsair Vengeance m90 Mouse and
Logan will be contributing a few
actually a few things so he's got an ax
860 power supply as
well as a vengeance 1500 headset and
finally a Vengeance k70 gaming keyboard
that he asked me to clarify is actually
the personal one that he's been using
he's taking it off his desk and shipping
it to the lucky winner which i think is
is pretty cool so to be clear guys these
are review items but what they also are
is a full pack of making your average PC
go from zero to hero in terms of gaming
capability you got a new graphics card
you got a power supply to make sure that
your system can run it and a full new
set of gaming peripherals to make your
gaming experience awesome
so in summary guys subscribe to me
subscribe to tech syndicate
comment on this video and comment on
Logan's video all of those links are
going to be annotated in the video or
available in the video description
for a chance to win our gaming PC
upgrade pack and I guess you could also
join the Linus tech tips forum or the
Tek syndicate forum but not both we
don't tolerate any kind of
cross-contamination now I'm just kidding
guys and then finally I guess Logan also
has an album that's available that was
just recently released about a week ago
I can't pronounce the name of it but you
can check it out on Bandcamp that link
will be in the video description as well
so peace out guys back to getting you

like owning Logan pretty hard here but I
think we all saw that that's not what's
happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
