2019 where a sous brought the CES show
to us this is the Zephyrus s GX 701 the
latest in their lineup of hyper thin and
yet super powerful gaming laptops you
might not be able to tell from the
outside or from its weight or even from
the inside unless you're like some kind
of electronics engineer and/or you know
this heat pipe design means anything to
you but this is gonna be one of the most
powerful gaming laptops out there we're
gonna show you all around it and our CES
coverage this year is brought to you by
D brand you can check out D brand's new
2nd gen grip case this is a drop proof
case we've got that link below as well
as their prism hammer proof screen
protector hit the links in the video
description at the links at the links
I'm standing
so from the outside the new Zephyrus
inherits a lot of the traits of it
15-inch predecessors it's super thin
you've got your exhaust ports here here
here and here because there is a lot of
heat to dissipate and you've got a
actually pretty ample selection of IO
with the one thing that's notably
missing being an rj45 jack because the
thing is quite honestly just too darn
thin to fit it but there are some really
cool new additions that are obvious
before we even open it up so while it
does have a power in Jack it can also
accept right there USB type-c power
up to 65 watts so that means you can
actually top this thing up on the go or
at the very least extend your gaming
time by a little bit another thing
that's really cool here is that they
have made some not too obvious changes
to the thermal design they're not
strictly speaking new to this generation
of Zephyrus but they're definitely worth
mentioning so these fans here are now
made using a liquid crystal polymer
which is presumably to make them like
super mega hyper thin and the shrouds
for them have been redesigned as well
so right here they've got like a dust
collection chamber so you won't gunk up
the fins of your heatsink and they've
added up a little pump to it let's just
say they've got a little lip on the
bottom that keeps here we go
typical Zephyrus fashion that keeps the
cool air that's being drawn in from this
flap that opens up at the bottom when
you open up the screens from mixing too
much with the hot air that's coming out
here and here because it wouldn't do you
a lot of good to exhaust the hot air if
you just sucked it right back in now
let's get it opened up and this is where
things get exciting these bezels are
hyper thin so even though it's a 17 inch
display the laptop itself is crazily
actually not that big and there's a
couple of options there's a 144 Hertz
1080p version and that
is gonna be obviously for the gamers out
there but even not quite because it's
Pantone certified so you could do some
light content creation on it and they're
gonna have a 400 nits peak brightness
HDR display with local dimming so that's
right 400 nits peep redness right so
yeah good try
now one disadvantage to this thin bezel
approach that you might have picked up
on is that I tried to launch the camera
happened oh wow it doesn't have a webcam
so a Seuss's rationale here is that most
gamers don't care about the webcam
anyway so they went so far as to not
even include a crappy one down here but
to rip it out entirely assuming that
anything you could build into a tiny
little bezel or anything like that
wouldn't be acceptable anyway and they
might as well just ship a standalone
webcam and it appears that it mounts
that's the standalone stand for it well
you know what I've had enough of your
crap
Jeff ah it goes like that oh look how
much of your screen it covers can it
kind of bite onto it like that okay so
it's an imperfect solution but it's
better than nothing you know which is
quite literally what you have if you
don't put this on I've been informed it
is at least 1080p 60fps so now let's
talk specs this little puppy is equipped
with a 6 core 8750 h our particular
model has 24 gigs of ram for some reason
and you can get it with either a GTX
tensa 2070 or 2018 max q did I say GTX
the first time damn it so this thing is
equipped with an RT X 27 T which I don't
know if it's equivalent to the desktop
version because Nvidia won't tell us a
damn thing about it
or a 28 Emacs Q which I also don't know
a damn thing about because Nvidia won't
tell us anything about it so I don't
know how neutered the 28 Emacs Q is
although presumably if Asus bothered to
do two SKUs it's either because Nvidia
their arm behind their back or because
even with the max-q variate the 20 80 is
still at least a little bit faster than
2017 either way what we know is that you
can turn our TX on and have glorious 40
to 55 FPS gaming on this machine and
there's a few other extras so the
keyboard backlight is now brighter than
ever this wheel right here adjusts the
volume and oh it has a 50% bigger
battery yes my friends Asus used a bunch
of the extra space they have down here
to put a 76 watt hour battery in this
thing so now you can gain for even a
little bit more over an hour on battery
fabuloso now in fairness to a soos it
does include the same GPU switch button
that'll actually trigger an entire
restart of the machine and switch
between g-sync discrete graphics mode
and optimist mode where you can't have G
sync but our testing on those FSM
yielded something like 54 minutes of
battery life in the PC mark battery test
even in optimist mode so I'm still not
expecting this to be like you know the
machine for meetings at the office or
whatever unless your office has very
very short meetings anyway what do
people expect it doesn't have
Thunderbolt
no no Thunderbolt I disapprove but I
approve of this message from D brand
without deep brand our trip to CES 2019
wouldn't even possible so big shout-out
to those guys go check out their new 2nd
gen grip at the link in the video
description
it's grippier than ever so no dropping
even for me and it's 65% thinner than
the first generation
it offers military-grade impact
protection along the full case and it's
easy to customize the backplate also you
can protect the front of your phone with
the brand now - with their prism screen
protector that you can literally smack
with a hammer and it won't break
obviously there are limits to this
technology we don't recommend trying it
at home but it's a heck of a lot better
than nothing and it's got a nice
glass-like feel even though it's an
impact resistant screen protector that's
pretty cool go check that out at the
link below as well so don't miss any of
our CES
nineteen content I think the rest of it
will actually be on the show floor so
the lake see you guys there I'm gonna
like warp in between this video and the
next one to Vegas and by subscribing
