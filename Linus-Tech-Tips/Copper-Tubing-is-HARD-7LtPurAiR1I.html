the years ranging from super jank DIY to
a iOS - all the way up to sub-zero
chiller units but there are still some
things that we've never messed with
until now going full hard mode with
copper rather than plastic tubing it's a
lot of work and the learning curve looks
a little something like this
but Boyle boys the end result ever shiny
Corsairs Vengeance RGB pro series
overclocked memory utilizes dynamic
multi zone RGB lighting to light up your
rig check it out at the link below
so the first question is why why would
we do something like this I mean it's
good to try new things but aside from
that is there any reason to use metal
tubing copper or otherwise truthfully
other than looks
no so if you're only worried about
cooling performance it's probably best
to stay with inexpensive soft plastic
tubing because as I demonstrated during
scrapyard bores to even a massive coil
of copper tubing doesn't dissipate much
heat so the relatively small runs in
your case won't make a measurable
difference so then with that other way
let's get started the case dictates a
lot of the other components that you
might choose for a build like this so
that came first
we chose the refreshed lelee PCL 11
dubbed the dynamic 4 it's all white
interior tempered glass side and front
panels and it's spacious trunk which
makes it perfect for hiding tubing and
cables next up is the actual gaming vids
for once here we're actually gonna take
a step back from insanity and just build
a respectable color-coordinated high-end
gaming machine that is without an
extreme edition CPU and Titan graphics
card so we opted for Intel's 8700 K one
of the best processors for gaming made
it to an Asus Z 370 a prime the widest
board in their lineup for this chip ran
then was an easy pick as the
best-looking weight RAM on the market
IMO is Corsairs vengeance RGB in white
of course for our graphics card we would
have loved to use the latest GTX RTX
excuse me RTX 2080 ti
but water blocks weren't quite available
yet when we started this build so we
went with the next best thing a 1080 TI
which is still a very powerful card and
significantly more affordable which man
if you told me a year ago I'd be calling
a 1080 TI more affordable Oh
anywho for storage we opted for a 512
gig samsung 960 pro is our boot drive
with a couple of iron wolf pros in the
PCL Elevens rear butt flap for storage
which brings us to water cooling where
things get a little more unusual now one
of the manufacturers that we featured in
our cheap Aliexpress water cooling video
Barrow actually makes some really cool
case specific water distribution /
reservoir blocks and they happened to
have one for the PCL 11 so that one
wasn't easy by then for the rest of the
system we requisitioned a bunch of
goodies from our friends over at ek
going for mostly their standard affair
stuff including their previous flagship
supremacy Evo CPU block a full cover
1080 Ti GPU block a couple of their slim
360 millimetre radiators and then a
metric boatload of fittings now sadly
while we were able to use their straight
16 millimeter hard line fittings these
are the same ones that you need for
plastic tubing by the way they still
don't have 90 degree fittings so we
needed to paint our own with everything
dry fitted the next step was sending the
fittings and radiators with a sanding
block for optimal paint adhesion oh and
before you guys head to the comments
below yes we masked off the radiator
fins an extra layer of paint isn't gonna
destroy your rad but it's not ideal for
thermals either now let's get back to
the star of the show the copper tubing
there are actually way more different
types of copper tubing and pipe than I
expected be it coiled
straight soft hard there whatever
combination of the four of them but you
actually don't need to worry about any
of that because we already went out and
spent the money to figure out which
one's best so that you don't have to
initially we thought that coiled tubing
would be our best bet this kind of
copper is pre and kneeled which means
that in the factory the pipe was heated
up red hot then cooled to soften the
metal now for materials like steel if
you quench the metal after heating it
actually hardens it making it great for
use in tools for example but with copper
heating then immediately cooling it
actually softens it making it perfect
for bending or so we thought in practice
you
with a fancy patented straightening tool
like this one from eastwood the tube
never ends up all that straight and it's
got little bumps and blemishes all over
it so coiled tubing wouldn't work for
the clean aesthetic that we wanted a
better choice ended up being straight
hard half inch diameter copper pipe
which is called half inch but it
actually has a 5/8 inch outer diameter
one really important note here though is
that you'll want to use the slightly
more expensive type a pipe its walls are
a little bit thicker which makes it
easier and cleaner to bend from here the
process is actually pretty similar to
regular hardline tubing each run starts
with roughly estimating the length of
the run with a little bit of extra on
each end and cutting a pipe with our
pipe cutter the one that you're looking
at now by the way will run from our cpu
block to the Barrow distribution block
then because we do still need to anneal
the copper before we commend it our tube
needs to be heated up for a minute or
two we used a matte gas torch now it's
really important here for the part that
you intend to bend to get visibly hot
and it should be noted that it actually
doesn't have to all be that same hot
color at the same time so once you see
it starting to get red you can begin to
work your way around once you're done
you can quench the pipe in a bucket of
water and then freak out a little over
the gross discoloration that you'll be
spending the next few hours dealing with
with a piece of sandpaper and some
polish now we didn't do it this way
hindsight is 20/20 as they say but we'd
recommend that you do the bulk of your
sanding before you bend the pipes
because it is a lot easier to send and
polish a straight pipe than a bent one
as they say anywho now it's bending time
since these are just single 90-degree
bends thanks to our fancy-pants
distribution block we don't really need
to mark out our Bend and we can just
kind of go for it I'd recommend for a
bender that you get something with a
fairly large radius like this one that
we got on eBay for 50 bucks smaller
radius benders can
you know give you a tighter Bend
obviously but they can also cause some
pretty severe crushing creating flat
spots on your Bend that will be very
noticeable especially if you go for a
smooth polished look on your pipes
we ended up initially filling our pipes
with sand to help them retain their
shape during the bend but it turned out
later that this wasn't necessary for us
though if you're having issues it might
be worth a try
the process was honestly pretty rinse
and repeat from here so I guess let's
watch a fancy time-lapse then of Jake
bending and fitting the pipes one more
pro tip here by the way if you already
sanded your pipes and you want to keep
them as scratch free as possible we'd
recommend putting some grease on the
mating surfaces of the bender at this
point all the painted parts were dry and
we could get into installation of the
finished parts first was our CPU block
with a white painted hold down plate and
RGB shroud then we installed our GPU
backplate our nicely painted white
radiators and the custom 3d printed pop
top for our DDC pump we actually didn't
have the appropriate oring for mounting
to the distribution block so this was
fun
we ended up making use of some high temp
silicone which work surprisingly well
Wow looking good all done right and no
because we were dumb and didn't press
and it it all has to come out again for
sanding and then polishing and I won't
bore you with every detail but the basic
process for us involved sending each
pipe with a fairly rough 400 grit
sandpaper then polishing with some brass
oh this gave us a pleasing brushed
finish that we really liked because the
high shine polished style tubing didn't
really fit the look we were going for or
the time frame that we were going for
for this build by the way we'd recommend
sealing the tubes with something like
brass lacquer when you're done as the
polish doesn't do much for preventing
tarnish now for final assembly we
mounted our tubes again ran our sexy
cable mod Pro cable kit made it to our
supremely reasonable RM 750 X power
supply and hoped for the best
eg lights on now good yeah there we go
once the radishes were resolved it
actually did end up working and the film
went pretty smooth with only one small
leak Jake forgot to put the o-ring back
on one of the CPU things bringing us
finally to the moment you've been
waiting for that sweet sweet minute of
jaw-dropping b-roll of what may be our
most beautiful system yet
and that's how you water cool with
copper pipe we're probably never gonna
do it again but if you want to go for it
