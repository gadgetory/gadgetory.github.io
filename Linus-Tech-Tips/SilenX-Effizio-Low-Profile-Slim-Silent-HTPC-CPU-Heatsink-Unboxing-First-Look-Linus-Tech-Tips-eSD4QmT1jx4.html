last in the new silent ex-officio series
of heat sinks this is their low profile
it is designed for use we have htpc
cases and other low profile cases it's
compatible with a wide variety of
sockets just like the rest of the
officio lineup here we can see that it
uses three six millimeter heat pipes so
even though it comes in a small box like
the compact it's actually going to be
more similar to the performance in terms
of well heat pipes okay it uses a Cylon
X fin
fan with optimized fan blades and it has
a universal mounting system compatible
with all these different kinds of CPUs
including K 8 a.m. 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 2 plus
LGA 775 LGA 1156 LGA 1366 and if you
want to read all that on your own you
could do it here and here are the specs
fairly lightweight which is what you'd
expect from an htpc optimized cooler so
let's have a look at the accessory
package which comes in a much smaller
box than the others already that pays
that much okay so okay that explains it
okay so we've got a fan speed controller
these are quite effective I've used them
before they're excellent it also
includes a double size Milk Protein here
you've got all metal fan mounting gear I
love that I hate plastics and for AMD
you've bought the same more of the same
more metal excellent it all feels
relatively sturdy as well and then you
have to worry about these going flying
off your socket or anything like that ok
so here is a fan this is a slim so this
is a low profile 100 millimeter fan this
only looks how thick is this thing hold
on a minute
24 decibel 54 CFM is what it's rated for
this is Ana physio series quiet sands
and I wish I could think of how thin
this is I mean it looks like ten
millimeter would be my guess but I'd
have to be 15 wouldn't it mom let's have
a look here yeah that's got to be 15
mils there it is next to a 25 millimeter
Cylon X fan so yeah it's got to be a 15
mil you know what why don't we plug this
in I'm kind of curious as to how loud it
is
that's not too bad it has a bit of an
airflow noise to it but it's not it's
not a distracting noise here I'll turn
it off and turn it back on again see it
takes a while to ramp up I guess because
of the small motor on it but here have a
listen to it ramping up now not bad at
all considering that it's a low-profile
fan and you can use the fan speed
controller on it of course so that'll
take it down to a much slower speed
alright here is the low profile cooler
that is low profile that's really
shortened okay not that I would call
anyone out on being short anyway here's
your Universal backplate with its
insulating cover on it so it doesn't
short out the back of your motherboard
and there is the heatsink itself so it
uses the preferred mounting system out
of the video series heat sinks I've seen
so I'm going to go ahead and pull out
these rubber grommets here unlike all of
the others from this series this
particular heat sink is not push-pull
compatible although I can't imagine any
reason why you would be trying to mount
a push-pull cooling system in an HTP see
I mean yeah you get more static pressure
but the whole point of this thing is low
profile you don't want to go and throw
two fans on it because you'd be far
better off to put more metal on it at
that point the whole purpose is just to
to get it as small as possible so one
thing that I mentioned or didn't mention
before is it's just a 100 millimeter fan
and this is kind of cool so check this
out okay hold on look pull these through
that go through already yeah okay so ah
- there we go number three trouble
getting my fingers on that one there we
are and the last one I am a little bit
on the OCD side I will need to put all
of these through in order to proceed
with the video and it is done so this is
kind of cool it also has manting holes
for what I'll presume
ninety-two millimeter so it's 100
millimeter fan it has 100 millimeter
holes which you can use to mount on this
particular heatsink but then you've also
got the 92 Mobile's if you wanted to use
it as a case then for whatever reason
although I wouldn't recommend that
so you've got three heat pipes these are
six millimeter heat pipes got a nice
flat base here with machine heat pipes
into it for a slightly better thermal
performance versus having a metal cover
and then the heat pipes embedded in that
I'll do the obligatory finger shot
you've got your universal mounting plate
and like all of the other physio series
heat sinks you have a little heatsink
right above the CPU core right here and
unlike all of the other ones this one
will improve performance in a way that
is meaningful because it actually has a
downward blowing fan the other ones are
going to get some incidental airflow but
they are tower heatsink so they're not
going to get a whole lot you can see
this is a tower heatsink and it has a
little cooler under it whereas this one
is actually gonna get direct airflow
right from the fin like all of the other
officio heat sinks this one does focus
all of its heat pipe cooling power right
under where the fan blades are going to
spin so I'm gonna go ahead and spin this
so you can see the heat pipes are one
two three on that side and one two three
on that side so they're lined up and
there we go right under where most of
the air flow from this heatsink is going
to happen now unlike the other physio
series this one does use a quite a loose
thin structure but I'm not going to
fault it for that because I think in
this particular application where you've
got a slim fan you're not going to be
able to generate a lot of static
pressure so it's gonna be all about
using a free-flowing airflow as
efficiently as possible and as quietly
as possible so you're not gonna go ahead
and put like a dense fin arrangement on
this and you're not gonna throw like a
beefy huge fan on it this is about
efficiency
this isn't about raw performance like
the other physios I can you're having
trouble hearing that I bet there you go
you've got that slight rip leanest to
the aluminum fins so that's gonna give
it slightly better cooling performance
than just a flat fin and you've also got
a bit of a wave shape to it which i
think looks cool maybe it does something
for performance maybe it doesn't I don't
really care and I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
this low profile cooler and let's see if
I can find something
to compare the overall height to hmm
just for fun why don't we compare it to
a to a knock to a NH d 14 there we go
so here's a height comparison for you
there's that cooler and there is the low
profile if is you the cooler is like
done before the fins even start thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
officio low-profile from silent X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
