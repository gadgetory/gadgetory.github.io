NCIX calm and today I'm going to talk to
you a little bit about how I found my
niche on YouTube i'm actually back at
one of the places that I originally
started really taking off with the whole
product unboxing thing this is a little
globe as well as behind me we've got a
little map of the world and I'm going to
take you on a tour of my world of
product unboxings product showcases as
well as short reviews so this next
little bit is about insight and search
so basically early on most of my traffic
was driven by the youtube search and i
was able to use insight to find out well
which topics are people interested in
and obviously the user views data
correlated with that and what I found
out is how to make my content more
interesting so actually on this very set
location which is an outdoor unboxing
location near our office i unboxed and
did a little product showcase of a raid
enclosure it was for the camera man's
video editing station it was totally not
like I wasn't that interested in it
personally and what I discovered is that
nobody cares whereas one of the other
videos that I did early on was actually
at a desk in a dimly lit office and it
was some hot new video card that I was
the first one to have an unboxing of and
you know I put all my tags and I
uploaded the video and to this day it is
one of my highest viewed videos so what
I discovered at that time was that for
me for product unboxings my big focuses
need to be about powerful keywords in
the search because raid enclosure I mean
what kind of technology enthusiast is
going to be searching for that there are
a few but it's not really a very
mainstream topic versus hot new
directx11 video card is going to
generate a lot more interest in terms of
search hits now back then everything
used to be searched driven I actually
do that many videos compared to what I
do now now YouTube's blog post which
I've read explains that if you have a
release schedule that's a great way to
allow your viewers to subscribe and know
when you're going to have new content
now I've personally never been
disciplined enough for that so my
solution to that problem has been just
releasing a ton of content over the last
six months or so I actually averaged
about 40 to 45 videos per month from my
Linus tech tips channel and what that
means is that a casual viewer is going
to happen across my videos quite often
they're going to find out that i'm
updating all the time and then they're
going to want to subscribe because that
means that whenever they sit down for
their nightly routine at their computer
they're going to have something to watch
on the linus tech tips channel and
that's how I've been able to drive more
subscribers to my channel so that means
that in contrast to the early days when
I was primarily search driven now I'm
actually primarily subscriber driven
with a lot of related videos and that's
tied into these subscribers who are
going to want to watch my videos after
they finish watching another one of my
videos and it's also related to the fact
I just have this huge content library
built up for my particular niche is a
product and boxer there's going to be a
lot of stuff that I've done in the past
that's very relevant to whatever i'm
looking at now so if I'm looking at the
latest video card people are going to
want to compare it to last generations
video card so that's where I'm able to
generate a ton of use by just talking
about the same sorts of things over
generations of product lines product
unboxings it's not a perfect art so you
upload a product unboxing you get a
bunch of views you don't know what
people were interested in you don't know
what they didn't care about did they
like the back of the box did they like
the inside of the box did they like the
when i turn the product around you can
see it from the back hard to say so hot
spots allows me to find out which parts
of the video my viewers are most
interested in so that in my future
unboxings maybe next time I do a
motherboard I can look more closely at
the things that people really wanted to
see the other thing that allows me to
monitor what I'm doing right what I'm
doing wrong is a subscriptions module so
on a more macro level when I
upload a video and I try something new I
can find out a couple days later well
hey did I lose a bunch of subscribers
did I gain a bunch of subscribers what
kind of an overall impact did it have on
my channel so thank you for checking out
my little video here for the YouTube
Partner Program that thank you to
youtube for making this possible and
