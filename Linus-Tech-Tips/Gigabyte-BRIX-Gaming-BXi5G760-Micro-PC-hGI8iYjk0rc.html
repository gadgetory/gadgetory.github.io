size and silence of ZOTAC CN 760 ZBOX
plus and by the fact that it has about
the gaming prowess of a playstation 4
well not to be outdone by ZOTAC a
gigabyte has sent us over there
unbelievable Brix gaming BXI 5g 760
ultra compact PC kit it's much smaller
actually more powerful can handle triple
displays out and it's just generally an
amazing piece of computer hardware the
Corsair Flash Voyager go is the easy way
to move photos music and videos between
your Android device and your PC click
now to learn more
the included accessory package is really
solid you get a vase amount so you can
mount it to the back here of TV or
monitor with ease you get a
three-and-a-half millimeter breakout
mini HDMI and DisplayPort to full sized
cables so you won't need any adapters to
hook the bricks up to all of your
existing gear and finally there's a
massive 180 watt power brick it's almost
as big as the unit itself speaking of
the PC itself the outside has a striking
glossy black and green color scheme that
does get covered in fingerprints quickly
but at least is easier to clean and more
difficult to scratch than some of the
other finishes that I've seen the top
has nothing but a power button and the
sides are entirely reserved for
ventilation on the front we've got a
microphone / headphone jack and 2 USB 3
ports then on the back we find 2 more
USB 3 ports can give it ethernet power
in a Kensington lock and the three
display outputs that I alluded to before
1 mini DisplayPort and 2 mini HDMI means
support for resolutions up to 2560 by
1600 at 60 Hertz or 4k 30 Hertz if
you're using it for movies on a TV
ballin but the outside of the hardware
isn't why you watch this show so let's
open this baby up it comes apart easily
just remove the four screws and lift the
little handle once inside we see that
it's a bare-bones unit so while it does
include a wireless AC and Bluetooth 4.0
card you will need to add your own ddr3
low-voltage Ram with
or both of the included slots and your
own storage drive or drives yes drives
uh this bad boy can handle an M SATA SSD
and a two and a half inch hard drive or
SSD at the same time it uses a single
pre cable managed connector soldered to
the board to enable this second drive
now the PCB were accessing here is
actually only one of two separate
stacked boards stuffed inside this cubed
form factor so that was the motherboard
and that's why it has all the expansion
and from this angle we can kind of see
the blazing-fast Core i5 4200 aged dual
core hyper threaded CPU mounted to the
other side and then this one this other
PCB is actually a discrete graphics card
so we can just barely make out the GPU
core and veer an oh and did I mention
that GPU is a desktop gtx 760 not a gtx
760 mm Wow did I mention it has six gigs
of gddr5 clocked at five gigahertz
anyway now that we're all calm again
it's time to install windows and take
her for a spin the first thing I noticed
when firing it up is that even at idle
it's not very quiet to get enough
airflow through the copper heatsinks for
the CPU and GPU those dual cooling fans
need to spin at a speed that makes this
little green gaming box easily audible
from ten feet away in a quiet room
that's a definite strike against the
Brooks gaming for me although not
everyone cares that much about noise and
for some folks the truly remarkable form
factor might make up for it all right
so the coolers on the loud side Linus
but how does it perform well just
because it says on the box that the CPU
and GPU run into a certain clock speed
doesn't mean that they will actually do
that in real life if they're running too
hot they will turn down their own
performance to protect themselves this
is known as thermal throttling and it's
a real concern with notebooks and small
form factor desktops so we need to see
how well the Brix holds up to some real
world
use to evaluate it schooling I started
out my benchmarking just kind of dinking
around with batman arkham origins
running with all the details cranked at
1080p and no anti-aliasing and I noticed
something almost immediately I was
humming along pinned against my vsync
limit of 60fps and then my framerate
started dropping until it reached around
42 fps tabbing out revealed that while
the CPU was still doing okay running at
3.2 gigahertz at 75 degrees mind you it
was only about 30 to 60 percent loaded
the GPU was running at 92 to 93 degrees
and throttling down to 405 megahertz and
even dipping to 203 megahertz depending
on the intensity of the scene it was
bouncing back and forth between those
power states I realized then that for my
benchmarking runs I couldn't make any
assumptions about how this Hardware was
going to perform and that I needed to
provide some points of reference for you
the viewer to give you a better idea of
how it will stack up against other
comparable devices so here's what I came
up with first I ran it against a Pentium
anniversary edition clocked at 3.2
gigahertz and a desktop reference 760 to
see how this class of hardware should
perform with no throttling at all then I
put it up against the zotac en 764 both
of the small form-factor machines I ran
each benchmark twice back-to-back and
took the second result because it's
quite a hot day about 30 degrees Celsius
inside this gives us a real worst-case
scenario for these tiny machines
compared to each other and to a properly
cooled desktop setup so that's it the
Brix gaming has impressive specs and if
you live in an igloo it's likely to be
the highest performance to volume ratio
gaming machine anywhere but while its
performance was actually still fairly
good 1080p and current games is very
playable in thermal throttling a boss
and ended up not performing as well as
the competing lower spec mini PC while
being significantly louder I'm all about
pushing the envelope in terms of PC form
factors but it looks like the world is
just
not quite ready for the size and gaming
gusto of this BRICS gaming machine maybe
if we give Intel Nvidia another
generation to refine things on the
processor side gigabyte can take another
crack at this and it will be absolutely
balls to the wall amazing but for now I
think that you might be better off just
building a bit of a bigger rig in
dealing with the extra size speaking of
taking a crack at things and track you
know what's addictive audible.com our
