and I heard a little story about how
that whole experience went down that I
thought was pretty funny and I think I'm
gonna share with the many thousands of
people who watch this show is it true
that you basically brought a picture of
Chris Evans to the barber and said like
this yeah I have a hard time picturing
you know you as like the guy who's like
this is the celebrity that I want my
hair to look bursary wasn't Chris Evans
it was I'm pretty sure that's his name
the Captain America yeah I watched
Captain America Winter Soldier yeah and
I was like that man has got it going on
I want my hair to look like that and I
went to the I went to the the
hairdresser and we had a little bit of a
language barrier I was trying to
describe his hair and it wasn't working
and after a bit I was just like just
give me like one moment and I pick up my
phone and I was like just get and she's
like okay and I just looked up Captain
America Winter Soldier and was like this
and she was like okay and it didn't end
up really looking like that no no but
like I was like okay that actually looks
pretty all right though and then I had
my own thing okay okay
you know what that's a bat that's fine
that's great so okay you got to tell me
how premeditated was this like have you
been growing into like scraggly man over
the last little bit because the
intention was to start with a a larger
Britt block of land from which to sculpt
in America okay so okay you guys don't
really know these sort of the kids I'm
gonna I'm gonna get even I'm gonna get
even more personal here because you also
like put on a bunch of weight yes what's
that the same plan
so you
Captain America absolutely so is there
some truth - because okay look like he
actually is far more serious about
working out than I am and the weight
that he had on now that this is not
necessarily true of like three years ago
but the weight that he had on like six
to twelve months ago I can make fun of
them about because it was intentional so
you were going for full beefcake yes is
much so is it easier to build big
muscles by building just a bunch of
weight first and then converting it well
I understand this correctly you do them
both so you eat an excess while working
out a ton and you build a lot of muscle
during that time okay and then you cut
down the fat and probably a little bit
of muscle but you try to retain as much
muscle as you can got it don't you don't
then reverse it to turn it into yeah you
you build up the muscle of the same got
it that's why remember I was doing those
like crazy like prison yes yes yeah yeah
that was when I was at my heaviest
weight okay so so so back to the
premeditation of the Chris okay so you
don't know the actual story then because
the Chris Neville okay was like 2014
okay this one was not a Chris
I brought my home picture of your
previous Chris Evans haircut okay well I
think I found your problem I mean I
think it looks fine right now yeah it
just doesn't look like Captain America
no but that's I gave up on that I don't
mind I don't care about that anymore
okay I just wanted what I had before
this whole idea was I'm not on camera as
much anymore right so I was like I'm
finally gonna do something I've wanted
to do for a while okay which was I
wanted to get viking beard viking hair
oh some more Chris Hemsworth
I guess store Chris - Chris and Marvel
characters named Chris yeah I guess that
was more the idea and then sure as of
now ish I'm like nah the hints not
working okay so this is probably gonna
go away - really probably you're gonna
ditch the beard you're not gonna go -
are you
I would like trimming back down to what
it was more like when I had hair more
like this got it okay so like this
double kind of style got it got it okay
all right so like you've had five oclock
shadows for three days kind of stuff I
mean the thing with you is like you
don't really need to make your chin line
like stronger like it's uh how do I say
this tactfully when Colton shaves his
[Laughter]
thankfully name okay it's not that it
makes it looked like he has a weak chin
it's just that his beard makes his
jawline and chin look stronger okay yeah
yeah I think Ryan almost does the
opposite effect because the hairs like
round around it yeah Perl around yeah so
I that my biggest problem has been that
it it likes to go in yeah so it's not
coming down yeah neck beard man yeah
that's and that's the hair even if I
shave all the way up to actually those
neck beard man thing it's like a
superhero called mr. Manning there's the
fedora guy there's like fedora guy meme
oh that guy yeah no yeah yeah that's a
that's a famous like me and picture okay
so is that one but this one's like yeah
but these are just this is neck beard
guys are just like men with neck beard
these are not like neck beard man to the
rescue
you know which I think I think could
could be very could be done yeah I mean
um so we actually yeah in the book
you're ready I just okay I actually I
wrote a few things really I did I did um
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bring them
up on screen okay but I think I can I
help you brand it okay are we beautiful
yeah how's your back okay so I actually
haven't decided whether or not to
include any of this but I did write a
few things down I have I have a fall
for my forward okay okay if I was a
total sellout I'd have structured this
book as an inspirational story about how
anyone can do it if they try hard enough
and a collection of tips to help you
achieve what I've achieved
yeah but then if I wasn't what did I say
but then if I wasn't interested in
making money I wouldn't bother writing a
book at all it's a pretty transparent
cash grab from my perspective so this is
the level of honesty that Elliott that
we're going for here I like it um I
don't I don't know if I'll include that
but I think I think it's I think it's
pretty funny those two points actually
we're not related they just ended up in
the same paragraph for no reason
that's why they don't really flow very
well look look we're talking like we're
talking like a couple of words on a page
when I'm talking like even like draft
stages right now yeah but I guess what I
would want it to be is something honest
I wouldn't want it to be like yeah you
know Disney Princess story you know
anyone can anyone can make it because
the cold hard truth if I'm being honest
with everyone including myself is that
in the current climate I don't know if I
would have made it and clearly I had the
stuff to make it if the time was exactly
right and the circumstances were exactly
right I firmly believed that any amount
of success is some proportion and I
couldn't tell you exactly what it is but
some proportion skill and another very
important proportion luck right place
right time look like effectively
everything in life is that yes of course
I mean with luck any worse I could have
been hit by a bus when I was six right
like yeah you never know yeah you know
that that dent in my head could have
gone all the way through and killed me
you know and there's crazy stuff like
that the whole way through
I think for me I don't know if this is
true for the audience you could have
died a lot of times oh yeah oh yeah oh
yeah yeah like actually yeah like yeah
like how like was it your first wind
show when you were like in a sling from
getting hit by a car yes yeah that was
the thing yeah I wasn't gonna say I it's
me I think it would be genuinely a lot
more interesting to hear about the
hardships right
I've even I probably know about a fair
amount of them but like I feel like as a
reader if they care they're gonna be
more interested in that I think I feel
like writing a self-help book like I'm
100 percent certain you could and I
think you'd be great but I don't think
it's the best thing you could do I also
think I could become like a
televangelist I don't I'd be excellent
at I'm sure you could that doesn't mean
that I think those people should have
the Jets that they fly yeah or that I
think that there's any moral ground to
stand on for and I'm not gonna say all
of them because maybe there's an
exceptional one yeah sure but you know
the the entire and I'm not I'm not
getting into my religious views here
because it actually doesn't matter
I could be Buddhist atheist Christian
like it actually just really doesn't
matter I have enough knowledge of
Christianity I will say that much to
know that the whole plant a seed of
money in hopes that it will come back to
you thing is nothing but horseshit and
it was it was never endorsed by any
figure in like you can you can go
looking hard enough in the Bible and you
can find validation for pretty much
anything it's like oh here's these four
words taken entirely out of context that
appear to back up the argument yeah
that's that's a bad that's that's that's
a bad scene it's a bad thing to do but I
forget where we were going with this oh
yeah I could write a probably be good
I'm a bit of a cynic and I take kind of
a cynical approach to self health books
I think that the most helpful thing you
can do for yourself is go out and start
helping yourself then again there's a
lot of people that have said you know I
read seven habits for Highly Effective
People or I read how to make friends and
influence people or I read this I read
that haven't read any of them so I can't
endure specifically endorse any of them
but life yeah yeah an interesting
observation have had about those things
sometimes you'll hear something a
million times from your your parents or
your friends or your partner or
something and you brush
and then you've read it on some random
book by someone who you're supposed to
listen to and you're like oh my goodness
it's so profound and it's the same damn
thing you've heard three million times
yeah like actually show up to work and
stuff like that which is like hey which
seems to be a problem in some cases
don't buy that crazy expensive car when
you shouldn't and then you read a
self-help like finance book and it's
like hey don't buy that super expensive
car and you're like whoa I never thought
about that like I don't know so
sometimes people might just need that
like little extra kick but who knows
so those are all only you have those we
don't know we're up on you oh wait we're
back okay I don't know what just
happened there okay what are we even
talking about today there's some weird
news it's not amazing news oh right
we're hiring yeah everyone is hiring
yeah we are actually hiring a total of
somewhere between six and more positions
like almost every department at both
companies yeah so there's gonna be a
dedicated video over on the Linus tech
tips channel because this is a pretty
big wave
but we're hiring between one and two
writers we're hiring a grip we're hiring
two shooter slash editors so that's the
LMG side you're hiring an infrastructure
DevOps person who specializes more on
the development side like building
automation tools for the infrastructure
team and a generalized JavaScript
developer and then in addition to that
and actually windchill is a perfect
place to discuss this on lmg is in a
really unusual sort of new and exciting
position where we have an opportunity
right now to invest in something totally
new and different where if someone were
to come to me like some like podunk
channel with you know 62 subscribers or
whatever else where they have like what
they think is a really amazing concept
but you know like I was alluding to
before in the current climate for
whatever reason they are
finding it challenging to to break out
because it's so hard to break out on
YouTube yeah you've got to convince the
audience you've got to convince other
creators like if you want to collab to
try to grow faster you've got to
convince the algorithm the almighty
elbow probably preys no no you know
you've got a you've got a you've got to
do all these things and so if someone
felt like they're really onto something
we would be but wait for the were hiring
video don't just like start messaging me
on Twitter yeah but we would be quite
interested in hearing from you and
trying something totally different
because as you might imagine there's a
lot of people in this building that have
passions that extend beyond technology
you know James was trying to pitch me
doing documentary you know brandon has
wanted to do more shorts and even a
feature at some point since before I
hired him he also wants to do more
commercial work just trying to think of
like individual people who have like
particular things they want to they want
to work on like you know I've wanted to
do like a really good toys channel since
well before yeah super fun yeah and
channel super fun morphed into not a toy
channel but you know maybe there's the
potential to bring back that original
concept and turn it into something new
so you know Colton is is actively
pursuing actually right now more of like
an agency role for Lynas Media Group
where we will take on in fact one of our
clients is sitting right here so where
we'll take on smaller influencers and
broker deals for them with larger brands
and we actually did something with Luke
who as you guys know doesn't work for -
Media Group anymore where he went to PAX
East was it switch car something
whatever so so that's something that
word that we're exploring so we're just
we're at sort of this bizarre point
where I find myself for the first
I'm since starting this company kind of
paralyzed like paralyzed by choices
because you we can do anything but not
everything so we have to make the right
choice because we're we're still a small
company in there yeah we can't just go
like oh let's start 20 new YouTube
channels and let's which never really
works out anyways let's let's start
building you know six different you know
physical products and see which ones
come to fruition like that's not really
our jam we're more about sort of doing a
few things and doing them as well as we
possibly can yeah yeah LTX is another
thing that's sort of like going crazy
right now and oh by the way we ran the
numbers you know that stupid spitball
number that I that I threw out last week
quarter-million dollars it actually is
like really close oh yeah that's about
how much it's gonna cost us now the good
news is we ran other numbers and if
everything goes absolutely perfectly
there is a chance we'll break even okay
so that's deep so that was exciting
so I suspect there will be some
additional costs and we'll just be like
a little bit below
yeah which I honestly is like the
perfect place to be like throw a great
big party for all of our supporters and
have a bunch of fun and you know like
Coursera pays for it you know like that
and that kind of thing to be clear we
actually don't know for sure of course I
was coming I was supposed to have a blog
post for you guys this week that was
going to be brands that have either
expressed interest or like are pretty
much coming for sure but we don't want
to lock any of that down quite yet one
thing I can tell you guys is very soon I
will have an update for you on when
ticket sales are going live it looks
like we've worked out most of the
wrinkles with how we're splitting
revenue with Dreamhack so like it's
gonna be exciting that's really good you
know what's interesting
have you noticed how challenging your
hairdo is for online video compression
to handle whoa
so let's go 1080p on YouTube over here
and especially when you look down you
can see it doesn't actually look that
great and then over on flow plane hey
actually looks a lot better doesn't it
pretty cool huh
damn alright that's cool hey hopefully
looks great also everyone that was
subscribed on the 31st got there two
three months
I was expensive but it's done so that's
cool how much did that cost us mmm oh
yeah I guess if we say that number then
people will know how many people are
subscribed to floatplane
people will know how many people are
subscribed on the new site which is
which is everything now no yeah which is
a little whore we lost some people in
the transition we're just not surprising
we knew that was gonna happen
it's actually not as much lower as I
thought it might have been really but it
also wasn't like as great retention as I
had hoped for that's why we're kind of
like in the middle you know I think it's
okay because the thing we still haven't
done it and it's crazy to think about it
Linus Media Group still hasn't done a
dedicated video driving people to
subscribe to flow plane that has never
happened no so I think once we're once
we're ready to rock are we ever gonna do
is the scrapyard course again I don't
know
secret shopper was kind of like yeah I
think it felt like it I got that sort of
like vague vibe it's serialized we're
gonna have like exploring something
there's some tension there's like more
or less a team more or less judgement if
the right deal came along where we could
do scrapyard wars in a way that was
really different from before
the problem is I think just shopping for
used computer hardware in Langley I feel
like is kind of played out for me like I
don't know what I would do that
differently like we've kind of yeah I
know I know the stuff we joked about in
the early seasons like well what if I
bought stuff and flipped it for our
profit and put that towards my budget
like that's become a norm
just like all started yeah and and we've
been to all like the the weird haunts
like I don't think there's gonna be that
many yeah like I'm not gonna find
another crack pipe in a computer and if
I did it would be like been there done
that yeah
whereas if if like other big sponsor
came along yeah there's yes we want to
fund scrapyard wars euro tour and we do
like a crazy challenge like we're over
there for two weeks and you have to
build an entire computer buying a
different component incurred by only one
component per country or something just
utterly stupid like that where this is
us like this is a season of a show yeah
you know and forget two weeks like we're
over there for six weeks or something
like that and we've got celebrity
entrants and we've got like we've like
what we want to do maybe one thing I've
wanted to do is we're neither you nor me
compete and we commentate but we like
commentate lives it would either be
great or horrible and I don't know which
one and we'd have invested a week of
everyone's time in it by the time we'd
find out probably more because we'd
probably have to edit the damn thing
before we'd find out so that's really
that's really tough that's at hard
that's a tough pill for me to swallow
because when we have a situation like
that we can't ask an outside party to
fund it I have to fund it yeah because I
don't know if it's gonna work what one
of the ideas that I had for that was and
I'm not saying this is better a big
warning is that it wasn't even really a
vaudeville we could maybe chop it up and
make them into vods but the idea would
be we like confiscate devices so you'd
want actually like many many hours like
watchable content live stream live and
we have people with like mobile live
streaming rigs which I've been doing a
lot of research on and are like not that
hard to build like actually really good
one yeah I built a terrible one once
though but cool but you
can build like that shut up actually
very your attitude and it would be fine
and you could like we could have cameras
following them throughout the whole day
and then just make sure that they're not
allowed watching each other's streams
they can't go into whatever so they
can't see what the other well everyone
would see you stream peeking
yeah and spawn stream yeah so like it's
you know unless you're like the bathroom
or something yeah it's like okay you'd
have to have rules around bathrooms like
look you got three minutes okay like
confiscating people's get in there and
get out yeah take their phones
yeah just mute your mic all right yeah
yeah I don't know it could be but then
again the same problem it might be eight
hours of just like boring trash which is
like honestly has been the problem with
Episode one of almost every season yeah
with it cut down yeah so like genuinely
eight hours of people be like man I'm
just really not find anything on
Craigslist really let's move all these
old IMAX does everyone in California
just use the iMac exactly so I don't
know I don't really know how to solve
the problem I was just thinking with
like that would be a nice every time we
do Scout card wars flow playing goes buh
yeah I know
every time um with that said it looks
like the virtual ticket which I was
asked not to talk about well it's too
late now
we're live the virtual ticket at LTX is
probably gonna have a strong floatplane
tie-in oh cool yeah so I would expect us
to have some fairly compelling content I
would expect us to work together haven't
talked to you about this yet but I'd
expect us to work together on a system
we're not just Linus Media Group but
other Creators we arm also present shows
and also on the floatplane platform
could also get a nice little subscriber
boost if people felt like supporting
them for virtual ticket instead of LMG
which of course we'd be totally cool
with because the way that I mean so a
float plane is actually legally a
completely separate entity and be Linus
Media Group and LTX I would actually
like for them to one day
be not separate but capable of operating
independently yeah LTX yeah that makes
sense it's kind of like the Penny Arcade
in packs it's like there's obvious
associations between that to put a
lawyer I have no intention of not
showing up anymore yeah yeah except for
during Backstreet Boys except for during
backs I am gonna go to that concert and
that's just gonna have to be but but
like I want it that way there's a
there's a ton there's a ton of people
that go to packs including myself that I
mean no offense to gaben Tyco but like
the only reason why I know their names
is because I've been going for so long
yeah never went because of them no
because their show is really cool they
did a great job with packaging and I
could see that becoming the future of
jobs as well
kopi asks how long does it take to get a
reply from the floatplane support team
pretty fast pretty fast but like we've
been a little bit behind but like pretty
fast I do know that as of last night
they zeroed out there was no tickets so
should be pretty quick Vic asks if the
price of floatplane will increase when
it's announced on the YouTube channel
absolutely
it will probably increase before that or
you know what maybe I don't know you
know well we'll have to see we'll decide
through we'll decide what makes sense
booboo asks why are we paying us to even
we're Canadian it's a great question
it's because like it or not the u.s.
dollar is kind of the currency of the
world it's also way more stable in
general and we a lot of our bills a lot
of floatplanes bills are in USD it's
also having one singular currency is
much easier when you're a smaller team
honestly the biggest reason is that
nobody knows what the hell a Canadian
dollar is so if we say hey it's five
Canadian dollars people like that a lot
if I can extrapolate his question I
think he's asking to pay in localize
currencies oh I see which like could be
a thing eventually but it's actually a
lot of work get a sign a lot of work on
multiple ends yeah all right why don't
we oh wow I was gonna say we should do
some topics but then we have to do
sponsor spots we have to go right at six
today because we are going to wait do
people know
allowed to say I don't know I know weird
like I'm gonna check with them okay so
we're going somewhere we ready to go to
tonight
yeah so our sponsors for today I
actually have no idea who they looked
you got pulse way palsy real-time remote
monitoring and management software
that's actually so easy to use that I
can do it you can manage and monitor
from one app it's compatible with
Windows Mac Linux and applications and
gets you access to real-time status
system resources logged in users network
performance Windows updates and more so
you can fix problems on the go by
sending commands from any mobile device
you can create and deploy custom scripts
to automate your IT tasks you can scan
install and update all your systems on
the go it's got remote desktop
functionality and my favorite thing is
like honestly one of the simplest thing
it does but it's it's made my life so
much better I get a ping everytime wanax
server is under 10 percent storage space
so that I can go hit ed delete the file
honestly though it has saved us so much
hassle with the like the camera guys
going to ingest something and it's full
or like they started and just overnight
come back in the morning it didn't
complete now we've got to do the whole
thing all over again that edit that was
supposed to start in the morning can't
start like yay pulse wave it's the very
real-world example to try it for free at
pulse wave dot-com right they're also
sponsoring today's episode private
Internet access we've actually been
working with pi/8 for almost a year and
a span Wow it has been a while and I
it's one of those sponsors that's great
because I haven't gotten a single person
saying no complaints not one no complain
it's affordable it works on Windows Mac
OS Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome
you can connect up to five devices at a
time on the same account which is
flippin sick and it's got all the VPN
and functionality that you could pretty
much ask for go check it out at LMG
GG / p IA when finally we have a bit of
an unusual sponsor I saw this Sunil
direct this right here this is really
cool and it's still wrapped dang it
jonno I'm assuming this with Jono so
these guys have all kinds of like
audio-video data connectivity solutions
everything you need for your next
project and one in particular is really
cool so this is their light link cable
and it is a 300 is that does that say
wait is that meter I thought it was 300
foot oh okay yeah so a hundred meter 300
foot HDMI cable it's an active cable so
you've got to go okay this one is
labeled for source and this one's
labeled for display but what so
basically it takes
so it's HDMI over fiber and utilizes a
converter in the head to turn electrical
signals into optical signals because it
uses fiber it can send the signal
instantaneously with no perceptible
latency at longer distances than regular
HDMI and this is without any need for
repeaters and you can check out this and
many many other AV solutions over at
Sewell direct.com
and you can save 20% on all their hdmi
cables using offer code Linus tech so
we'll have that linked below for you
there uh should we do should we do any
news Oh hold on I'm about to find out oh
ah nope he would prefer if we did not
especially on LAN show alright so we are
going to a party but we can't say why
yeah or what it's for or why it's really
exciting I'm really sorry you guys good
I'm sorry I brought it up in the first
this particular person on staff is quite
private actually they were the one that
showed me the the whole flag thing with
will Whedon you know you don't deal
about this you see this you heard about
this so will Whedon put up a flag I
forget what the flag was of an American
I don't know some kind of flag and it
was basically like like a silent movie
or oh no sorry um what the other guy the
general both Shia LaBeouf whatever they
both look the same to me yeah I know the
story that's great go keep going cuz
they should know yeah okay so anyway
Shia LaBeouf puts up
sorry not boo I was so confused I'm
sorry they're both just like living
internet memes I understand to be fair
like that's I think that's why I figure
out who was so quickly so Shia LaBeouf
put up this flag that was like some kind
of Trump protest or some people stand
together or something anyway and then it
was live streamed so it had a camera
pointed at it and it was supposed to be
impossible to find because it was just a
flag in a field and you couldn't really
see anything other than the sky behind
it he will not divide us sure yeah
yeah that's right thank you and then
basically 4chan put their collective
heads together and managed to determine
from the paths of aircraft flying behind
it because it was a live stream where
exactly it was and find it and replace
it with what did they replace it with I
thought it was a Pepe flag I don't I
don't know I don't know the point is
this particular member of our staff who
they definitely stole it yeah they
definitely stole a flake I don't know
yeah drew my attention to this and
basically said this is why you know I I
won't post any pictures on the internet
even if like my wall because given
enough time and enough people don't
remember the the old studio which old
studio the house yeah yeah when the
person recognized what house it was
based on the floor yeah cuz that weight
based on the floor wasn't it the floor I
might not remember this story properly
so we did have what within like days of
us moving into our old studio the the
house someone had looked up like real
estate listings for houses that were
recently sold in that area like the
detective work involved in this one
honestly isn't even that deep yeah cuz
they were able to look and then out of
actually I think there were several
houses
with the same floor plan because it's
one of those really say me subdivisions
they manage to determine which exact one
it was and I think they like left
something on the doorstep or something
so needless to say it was pretty creepy
for us at the time and actually was part
of the reason why I just gave up and
that's why our address for this studio
is on our website
- Media Group double-booked this falls
on Google because I like really ever
since we did that all the intrigue all
the exciting where do they film it's
just dead I've had people ask like where
do I send fan mail I've had random
people with just how do I ship you stuff
I'm like I'm just Google it super easy
no problem it's right there don't worry
about me sending you the answer because
you can look it up at any time on Google
Maps yep
and to be clear I'm not advocating this
solution for every creator no I mean
there's a lot of good idea for Gavin
from slow-mo guys had a gunman show up
at his house well so did a doctor
disrespects really two drive-bys on his
house bullets through the building when
did that happen this was fairly recently
Wow yeah like people suck so like maybe
not the greatest good news for us is we
make relatively uncontroversial content
yeah hey you like that computer stuff
[Laughter]
respect ever do to anyone
probably disrespected them now you
better applaud yourself because not
getting it from anybody else oh man I
was great nerd cubed apparently got a
crazy fan show up outside their
apartment door cuz they accidentally
showed the floor outside of his
apartment yeah yeah it's a thing people
suck but like if you if you removed some
of the the the mystique and the
potential intrigue it has worked great
for us for the last three and a half
year
no no ik yeah and it's been it's been
good I think overall actually our
community is sort of a cut above some of
the other ones though and I don't say
that to like try to kiss ass or whatever
else it's not about that it's just like
if you go into our comments section and
you go to any other video on the
internet and go to the comments section
like even on YouTube which is I an utter
cesspool YouTube comments section it's
it's it's horrendous
Horace is for the most part really
respectful generally yeah it's still not
like obviously it's not perfect any-any
comes better yeah everyone didn't want
to show too hard but like and any open
public forum yeah is going to have some
garbage some disagreement yeah yeah like
it's it's gonna happen but it's not bad
yeah um speaking of bad face times bug
this was originally posted on nine to
five Mac or at least our article that we
got the source from is here Oh from the
forum posted by suits on the forum and
their article that they're refreshing is
nine to five Mac calm a bug discovered
this week let's you call anyone with
FaceTime and immediately hear the audio
coming from their phone before the
person on the other end has accepted the
incoming call it's not technically
immediate you you add person to create a
group called then you add your own
number mhm so it's like it takes a
little step but like if they're not by
their phone you're gonna get it oh we're
still here
did someone just turn off the lights oh
wait oh I think it's fine no no that was
his light it's just it was bright look
we still look fine and that one oh this
one cool yeah Brandon just hit the like
Picasa seen everything off and that one
for some reason the blue ones on a cast
module but the red ones not so I'm not
sure what the deal is there exactly
that's fine
anyway Apple has temporarily disabled
group FaceTime calls giving themselves
time to fix the bug without breaking
other things and the bug was found by a
14-year old he and his mother tried to
report it for days before Apple
responded going as far as registering as
developers in the bug bounty program
Apple has apologized for the
again says affixes coming in the next
week have they committed to like give a
bunch of money to this kid yet they
should they probably should yeah uh in
other news as was posted by RC mihail on
the forum there was a big data breach
actually a bunch of big data breaches
mass um so we had collection one what
was this like last week something like
that I did very recently I don't know
exactly don't remember big data breach
now we've got collections two through
five something like that the biggest one
is collection two at 526 gigs of text
and the price for a lifetime access to
it is just $45 the hacker has access to
some four terabytes of password packages
which are less than a year old so if you
want to know if you've been poned check
have I been poned dot-com probably have
