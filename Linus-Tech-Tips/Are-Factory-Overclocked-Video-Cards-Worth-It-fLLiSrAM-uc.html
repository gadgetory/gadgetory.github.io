thereof and spending more on your
graphics card to get a higher factory
overclock or fancier cooler or bored
design when you're not going to be
overclocking sorry for not overclocking
we've covered that quite heavily in the
past and it just isn't the point here as
we're specifically trying to investigate
the worth of factory overclocks there
will also only be one manufacturer
included EVGA why because they have an
excessively high amount of gtx 980
models they have 10 that's insane
but wait why 980 you've made a billion
980 videos in the past and it's value
proposition isn't even that good anymore
good that's not the point I'm not trying
to tell you what card to buy I'm just
investigating the potential value in
factory overclocks this video is also
not sponsored
I contacted EVGA because they were a
prime example of totally creo mounts of
different card versions and they agreed
to send me 4 cards as long as I sent
them back there was no financial
exchange and we don't get to keep the
cards we gain nothing from this other
than a video and spoiler alert if you're
not overclocking don't buy the most
expensive version of a card but stay
tuned to find out why
Phoenix collections art or mechanical
keyboard comes complete with gold-plated
cherry MX brown switches an aluminium
coating and a full 104 key layout check
out the link in the video description to
learn more although many graphics card
manufacturers sell multiple cards with
the same GPU perhaps the most well-known
and excessive example of this is EVGA
which currently has 10 different
versions of the GTX 980 so we decided to
take four well-known models from this
product stack and see well how they
stack up today we've got the reference
the superclocked
the for the win addition or FTW edition
and classified editions of the GTX 980
all of these cards including the
reference model came with EVGA ACX 2.0
cooler except for the classified which
contains a larger version of the cooler
due to its larger PCB and more
aggressive power delivery so what
exactly do you get with these four
models the reference card sells for the
same amount as a card with a reference
cooler about 500 US dollars and is
essentially the same as a completely
reference designed card except for the a
CX 2.0 heatsink for 10 bucks more the
superclocked Edition features about a
150 mega Hertz higher boost clock but no
other significant upgrades another 10
dollars will score you the FTW Edition
which not only gets you another modest
clock bump but also a second BIOS chip
for further customization and a 6 plus
to power phase design for more
overclocking Headroom as opposed to the
4 plus 1 on the less expensive models
finally the classified serves close to a
no compromises card for extreme
overclockers it features a beefy 14 plus
3 power phase system and a third BIOS
chip including ln2 mode which we'll get
more into later you also get a small
increase in out-of-the-box clock speed
though this will all set you back a
whopping six hundred and thirty five
dollars far more than the other three
cards so how did we test all this well
we used our standard test bench however
to get a more accurate idea of the cards
thermal performance we put the entire
test bench into our cooler master master
case pro 5 obviously - the bench
self with its default fan configuration
instead of using an open-air test bench
we ran all of our components at stock
speeds also by the way the first thing
we want to check out was the performance
of GPU boost in our first video on the
topic which you can see out here we
found that there's a fair amount of
variation even among otherwise identical
cards but also that the advertised boost
clocks tend to be conservative estimates
of what you'll actually get in real
world gameplay with our EVGA stack we
mostly saw the same thing as the
reference superclocked and for the win
editions all saw load clocks that were
faster than what were advertised with
the reference and for the win additions
both exceeding the official
specification by over 35 megahertz
however the classified fell a little
short for whatever reason but as most
people who will buy this card will
probably be overclocking it's not a huge
concern but not good for me the way the
ACX 2.0 cooler did give us better
performance over the reference cooler
which lets Nvidia cards get up to 83
degrees Celsius before thermal
throttling the highest we saw on our
EVGA stack however was just under 75
degrees under load the classifieds
larger cooler didn't actually really
make it any cooler than the other cards
though it does have a much larger vrm to
cool down and if you were overclocking
more you might see a performance
difference there now let's have a look
at real-world performance in games the
out-of-the-box overclocks on the non
reference cards did give us some slight
performance gains in 4k with the
superclocked Edition adding 2 to 3 fps
and the for the win Edition adding
another 1 to 2 on top of that they
classified actually fared the worst of
the three overclocked cards again I
suspect most people in the market for
something like a classified won't be
running it at default speeds anyways and
could squeeze a bit more performance out
of it like we've seen in the past with
our classified reviews but still today
however we're looking at what card will
give you the best performance out of the
box and the for the win Edition walks
away the winner I'll be it by a very
small margin since the difference
between the for the win and the
reference a CX card is only twenty
dollars it may be worth it to spend the
extra on a higher clock out of the box
and more overclocking Headroom with
extra power phases
you can squeeze it into your budget and
even if you're not an overclocker
you may think it's well worth the 20
bucks to get a little bit more
performance out of the box without
having to play with anything so in
conclusion if you're trying to pick
between stepping up an entire class of
graphics card or just getting a better
cooler and overclocking solutions on
them maybe jump up an entire class of
graphics card that's what I would
recommend but if you've got 10 20 maybe
30 bucks lying around getting a better
slightly higher tuned or better cooled
or better power phase designed graphics
card can actually be kind of worth it an
interesting insight and unless you're
looking into overclocking just don't get
the top-end one just don't get like a
couple steps in unless you want it for
the looks I guess but that's on you man
