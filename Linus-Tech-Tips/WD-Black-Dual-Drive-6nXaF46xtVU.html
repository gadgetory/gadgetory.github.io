welcome to my unboxing an overview of an
extremely exciting product this is the
WD black squared dual drive which is to
say that when you open up the package
there is two drives inside and I'll show
you guys this check this out we got we
got inside okay well there's a USB drive
and then if you dig under the quick
install guide which is in about one
bajillion languages and the technical
support and limited warranty which is a
five-year warranty because this is a
Black Series Google Drive you find
another drive so there it is a USB Drive
and a hard drive the black squared no
that's not what it is at all okay I'm
sorry you guys this is just the software
that you need to take advantage of
Western Digital x' first consumer-grade
hybrid drive but when they call it a
dual drive it's a little bit different
from the kinds of hybrids that were
normally used to this is a nine and a
half millimeter form factor so double
check your notebook to make sure it
works it doesn't go down to seven
millimeter like many SSDs and even
high-capacity hard drives do these days
but there's a reason for that it has
both a one terabyte 5400 rpm notebook
drive inside and a 120 gig SSD okay
Linus but this isn't the first time
we've seen a hard drive at an SSD jammed
into a tuna half-inch enclosure the
first time we saw it was actually about
three years ago with the Seagate
momentous XT so this is basically the
same right the answer is no the Momentis
xt uses a regular notebook hard drive
just like this one does and it uses a
four gig for the original or 8 gig SSD
as a cache so that is to say that you
never actually see it it's working in
the background accelerating applications
bringing that hard drives performance
closer to SSD but not quite to the same
level as an SSD the black squared uses a
very different implementation so it
actually takes a dedicated 120g SSD and
lets you throw your operating
and your key games and applications on
it for lightning-fast pure SSD
performance which isn't to say that it's
the fastest SSD on the market or
anything like that but it is light-years
faster than a mechanical hard drive
especially if you're coming from our
drive you go to ss2 you're like well
holy crap they're faster anyway so it's
an actual dedicated SSD then it has a
completely separate 1 terabyte hard
drive that you can use as a dedicated
storage drive so it actually shows up to
your system as a C and D drive that you
will manage separately and there's a
little application that you install off
this clever USB Drive in order to get
all of that working so ok - I don't know
if that's the kind of thing that my mom
would find as user-friendly as this
Drive where you just plug in the one
drive and it shows up as one drive and
it's all works on the background and I
think WD knows that because look at the
branding on it it's black it's intended
for enthusiasts it's intended for the
folks who are able to see the value of
having to specialized solutions
installed in their computer within one
enclosure that are each good for a
different thing so that is the SSD for
small storage but fast and the hard
drive for large storage but not nearly
as fast and who is it actually form only
enthusiast well I would say the notebook
guys someone was a notebook that only
has a single tune a half inch pay please
bear in mind guys it is a nine and a
half millimeter drive so you're not
going to be installing this in every
single notebook out there double check
with your manufacturer for compatibility
but if you have a single two and a half
inch bay and you want the best of both
worlds without having to deal with
carrying around additional external
drives that my friends is who this is
for thank you for checking out this
unboxing an overview of the WD Black
squared dual drive now we understand the
name of it don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other computer videos it's been a
while since we've done this but yeah I
forgot something there's also a USB
transfer cable included so that's USB 3
which is handy nice and fast and it's
also included in the QuickStart guide
how to backup your old system to your
new black square drive and be pretty
much ready to rock pretty quickly there
so there you go say that in there and
then USB 3 there and I love this
auxiliary power right there
