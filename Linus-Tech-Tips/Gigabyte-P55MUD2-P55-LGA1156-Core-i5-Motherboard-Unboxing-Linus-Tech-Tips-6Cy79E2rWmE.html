that today we've got the gigabyte p 55 m
UD 2 so what you may have noticed by now
if you've watched all our P 55 gigabyte
unboxings is that there's a bit of a
pattern to the naming so M means we've
got another micro ATX board on our hands
three year warranty ultra durable three
but we're missing the crossfire Dolby
and SLI logo so let's get this board
open this is gigabytes entry-level micro
ATX p55 board so we've got our manual
here then we have our installation
driver and utility DVD then we have our
smart stick smart six MARSOC smart six
user guide we have the multilingual
installation guidebook so that's your
Quick Start Guide and then we have two
SATA cables and IDE cable and an i/o
shield there that's your accessories
this is an entry-level board in terms of
the overall accessory package so here we
go let's get this baby opened up and
we're going to be comparing it in a lot
of ways to the p55
and beauty for because that is a more
feature-rich board it's more fully
loaded so this one compared to that
board doesn't have the robust MOSFET
cooling solution it also doesn't have
support for SLI and crossfire this port
is only capable of running in 16x mode
and this one even though it physically
is a 16x port you can see the pins here
if you can see the pins here actually
are only 4 X so that means that this is
a 4 X pcie 2.0 slot but it runs off the
chipset rather than the PCI Express
Lanes built directly into the CPU that
means if you actually tried to run SLI
or crossfire on this board your
performance wouldn't be very good now
like all p55 boards you do have support
for dual channel ddr3 memory and I'm
glad to see even on an entry-level board
that we've got 4 slots for that that's
really good and then up at the top left
we've got our 8 pin power
the talk right on the edge we've got the
24-pin power exactly where they belong
and then I'm really happy to see this
actually we've got seven SATA ports even
on our lowest end board here so they've
actually got their optional gigabyte
SATA ii chipset here really good to see
we don't have some of the higher-end
features like onboard clear CMOS and
power buttons but that's what you expect
out of an entry-level product so now
let's have a look at the i/o panel on
the back so you've got wow it looks like
almost all of gigabytes boards have
about 10 USB ports this one actually has
11 Wow so then we've got a ps2 mouse USB
combo port digital audio here's one of
those USB eSATA combo ports and then
you've got a FireWire port Gigabit LAN
and 7.1 audio thank you for checking out
