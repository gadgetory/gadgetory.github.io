you can tell the whole place is a hub of
activity based on the amount of
background noise going on here so we've
redone something here you can see out
the front of the store so the entrance
will actually be right here you'll come
in this way it's an automatic door if it
that's not working for the moment anyway
you come in you go around this pillar
here and then you'll be greeted by lots
of cases and monitors and then if you
walk over here you'll be able to see the
cases that are on display if you walk a
little bit further you can see all the
monitors that are on display I don't
know if I showed any footage before of
the monitors that we have opened up and
for your viewing pleasure on the wall
here we've done quite a bit since the
last video that I uploaded we've got the
cable wall mostly done now so all the
cables accessories tools so naturally
that's near the service area which is
back there where all the swag is and
then we've also updated the speakers and
printers so there's a fair bit of stuff
going on over there here behind the back
counter we've got memory loaded up onto
the wall now and I don't think I've
actually shown where all the video cards
are so video cards are going to be
behind here these are actually going to
have glass on them shortly and then
motherboards will be sitting down in
this case and let's see what else have
we made progress on I've already showed
the gaming section here we've got lots
of pyramids set up near the front of the
store so don't look too closely at these
because they may or may not be door
crashers not that I'm giving any hint
we've got the TVs up you're working now
I believe they're running off of a sous
old place well you can see we have for
displays here above the counter
and here actually if you check out on
this side you can see sort of all the
way down all the video cards that are
stocked up behind the shelf so we have
some cases back here to some antec cases
so that's our progress as of right now
and I'll be updating as things sort of
progress one thing that I haven't shown
yet is a shot at the front of the store
so I figure I might as well come outside
so I'm in first marking place here right
now I'm just going to wait till that car
sort of acknowledges me and then I'll
cross the street so have a look behind
me at what the store is actually going
to look like so there it is so people
will be lining up out this door and then
they'll presumably be lining up all the
way around the other side of the
building and then depending how many
people there are it could get pretty
pretty chaotic but we are fully
expecting people to be lined up across
the front of the store at opening time
and potentially even all the way down
here around the back of the store</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
