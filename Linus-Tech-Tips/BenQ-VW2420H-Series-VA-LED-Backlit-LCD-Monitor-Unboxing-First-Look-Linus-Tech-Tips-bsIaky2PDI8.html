after product that has unique cool
features and yeah that seems like they
don't get a lot of attention for it so
today we're going to be having a look at
the VW to 20 for 20 h series LED monitor
and what makes this special is the fact
that it is an LED backlit LCD monitor
with a ba panel then Q is claiming me
178 degree viewing angle which will be
extending if it actually is because
that's a very very good and Bend Q's
whole thing is that they have all these
features they have all these high-end
technologies because wherever it can be
a fancy-pants monitor with LED this and
adjustable stand that and pivot but at
the end of the day if it's using a TN
panel it's only going to be as good as a
TN panel which means that you're going
to have kind of washed out looking
whites from some angles and then know
it's all dark from this angle so so in
terms of viewing angle in terms of color
reproduction TN panels are never going
to be while Kashyap say never I mean
technology does things that I don't
understand that it's probably not going
to be as good as a VA panel or an IPS
panel at any point in the near future so
here we go benq comes right out and they
say look this is a VA panel has a great
viewing angle what else did it have to
say for themselves on here so are any of
these English yes here we go it's black
the brightness is 215 it's the contrast
is three thousand to one al look at that
they read their monitor both in terms of
contrast and in terms of dynamic
contrast which they're saying is 20
million to one great agree response
times of 8 milliseconds and in terms of
inputs we've got vga DVI and hdmi on the
other side we find not a whole lot ok
let's go ahead and open up I already cut
it open just a second ago
okay so the first thing we find inside
is some foam foam is good foam protects
the products okay I'll go ahead remove
that we also have a base stand okay so
here appears the amount of foam that
will be protecting your product this is
important critical either because
especially if you're ordering from an
online retailer such as NCIX wow that's
then nice um it will have to ship
sometimes by camel other times by boat
other times by airplane or donkey it'll
have to reach you somehow and that
packing can be the difference between a
dead monitor when it arrives and a
working monitor when it arrives all
right here we have been q disk contents
user manual adobe reader thanks benq I
suppose okay next we have a power cord
which goes to a power brick which goes
to a DC plug on the back of the monitor
so you can tell right away by the size
of the power brick this is a very
efficient monitor and you can also see
why benq chose to do external power for
this monitor when you take a closer look
at it it only CLE includes a vga cable
so you're going to have to buy a DVI or
hdmi cable but check this out very very
slim very slick looking little panel
here so here I'll show you guys the
thickness comparison with the iphone 4
just because i figure everyone probably
knows about how thick and iphone 4 is so
there you go there is your monitor not
in that much thicker the world's first
VA LED monitor beautiful inside and out
so it's a 24 inch monitor this is going
to be 1080p so that is full HD and you
know what I'm going to need you guys to
give me a second here to peel all the
plastic protectors off it so that I can
show it to you properly so just for the
sake of letting you guys see the viewing
angle a little bit I've got 3d mark a
than running right now I'm gonna go
ahead just kind of trim this earth it's
actually really good so here you can
look at it from the side I'm going to
turn it sort of slowly back towards you
and you're even looking at it top down
right now which is less good than
looking at it straight on but it's still
doing a pretty impressive job I'm
actually going to go ahead and borrow
the camera from my assistant today here
and I'm going to go ahead and show you
guys sort of top-down really really good
I mean I'd say 178 degrees is a bit of
an exaggeration but here I'm just going
to tilt this all the way back but still
very very impressive I mean that's sort
of my expectation with a quality VA
panel anyway but it's just good to see
that they are living up to what they see
they're trying to do with this product
um stand is pretty pretty normal and say
it's a little bit unique in that there's
a gold benq normally the benq logo is
silver or white and then there's a gold
accent around the bottom of the monitor
looks kind of nice down here the
on-screen display or the on-screen
controls are all here so you get your
enter right left menu and auto how let's
go ahead look at the back of the monitor
so the back of the monitor not much to
say there's just your HDMI in your DVI
in which I haven't screwed incorrectly
oops your VGA in your headphone out so
if you're using HDMI in you can listen
on headphones and then your power in and
I think that's pretty much all I all the
comments I have on the VW 20 for 20 h
like I said I really don't think benq
gets enough credit for some of the cool
products they bring out because they're
one of the few manufacturers who's
actually going to come out and say we
are making this using this kind of panel
this is what you get when you buy this
product almost everyone else it's all
playing them playing around with you
know batch IDs and manufacturing dates
in order to find out what it is that
you're actually going to get depending
on who you're talking about so thank you
