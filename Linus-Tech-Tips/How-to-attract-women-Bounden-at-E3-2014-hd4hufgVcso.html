brought to you by HyperX fury series
high performance SSDs the Corsair
Vengeance k70 and k9t RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX comm are trusted
retailer for high performance gaming pcs
alright guys so this might not be as
traditional of a video game as you might
be expecting but what can you tell me
about bounden Bonin is a dancing game
for two players on your phone so I know
it sounds weird but the way it works is
you see a ball on the screen and there's
there's a crosshair and there's rings on
the ball and kind of neat to match those
and by moving the phone so while you're
actually trying to grab those rings
you're already dancing this isn't first
off this isn't pc compatibl i know you
guys are all piece of guys that
obviously is not as it kind of needs to
be on this small mobile device and you
are gonna have to find a partner and
actually dance with someone so can we
show how this works okay so you pair up
on each side and then it takes a second
to calibrate I'm a horrible dancer as we
can see
now we go up and these dances were
choreographed by who by the Dutch
National Ballet
so they they designed the dances they
made the choreography and we put them in
the game that's awesome yeah I can tell
that a lot of these had a lot of thought
go into them if you guys haven't if you
can't tell I've actually done this
before despite being completely terrible
okay we made it we made it alright
carrying it an interview while doing
this sort of a dance it's not
necessarily the easiest thing on the
planet but I think it's going ok so
there isn't really actually a ton to say
about this game there's no storyline any
of that kind of stuff but it doesn't
need it it's like the action is going on
outside of the screen right yeah it's
going on on the screen isn't that
interesting it's more about two people
moving weirdly like twister and if you
get better and then you're like doing
ballet yeah yeah exactly
and you guys are trying to find a way to
get your girlfriend into video games
this is probably gonna be very
successful form of doing that I think
that's about it we're gonna finish this
dance soon but there isn't really a ton
more to say other than that I'm very bad
at dancing and she's much better than me
so you definitely let me through that I
think that's supposed to be my job but I
failed oh well thank you for showing us
this game we're gonna check out the rest
of Nek thank you guys for watching if
you want to see all the rest of our e3
content be sure to subscribe to Linus
tech tips and as always thanks for ton
to HyperX Corsair and ncx for sending us
here this year without them we would not
be here I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
