have getting excited about a new machine
can be difficult to say the least like
take the latest Asus zephyrus the
engineering that went into making
something that powerful that slim is
seriously impressive and yet the Zephyrs
just doesn't turn me on but looking at
the new Alienware area 51 M I have an 85
percent IRR
now eight and a half pounds the area 51
M doesn't care about you your back your
ears or even your dog but all it cares
about is insane gaming performance but
can a laptop no matter how big really
tangle with the desktop let's find out
after you find about glasswire instantly
see your current and past network
activity detect malware and block badly
behaving apps on your PC or Android
device use offer code Linus to get 25%
off glasswire 2.0 at the link below with
our model coming in a $4,500 the
Alienware
area 51 m is one serious piece of kit
and it feels like it too the magnesium
chassis has to be one of the most rigid
I've ever felt like there's absolutely
no flex and opening the screen just it
just feels so good it also has a strong
assortment of i/o with the highlights
being Thunderbolt three multiple display
outs and my personal favorite a 2.5
Gigabit Ethernet port maybe the most
interesting hole though is the power
connector or should I say connectors
this power brick alone just this one
right here weighs a quarter pound more
than the service laptop itself and it's
not even the only one there's two power
bricks and together they pump out over
500 watts now why do we need all that
power
well Dell hasn't just put laptop parts
in here that's that's just garbage
they've put in a full fat desktop grade
until Core I $9.99 hundred K as paired
pleasantly with an NVIDIA RTX 20 80 32
gigabytes of RAM and 2 terabytes of
storage now all of this computing power
is delivered to your eyeballs through a
hundred and forty-four Hertz 1080p IPS
display with HDR and gsync there is a 60
Hertz version but just don't buy that
one because this one right here is
awesome - game on I do kind of wish they
had a 1440p version but they couldn't do
it with a smaller bezel so oh well and
it's not like the 1080p panel here is
hard to look at we also have damn-near
desktop level upgrade ability removing
the bottom gives you access to four
sodium's slots for the RAM the MDOT two
slots
and a 2.5 inch drive Bay delving deeper
UPS difficulty a bit but thankfully a
lemur has created videos showing how to
properly take this machine apart along
with convenient guidelines here on the
ribcage showing just how many screws
need to come out and hopefully go back
in after removing the battery the back
shroud thing and a couple of ribbon
cables we can see the real meat of the
beast like look at this cooling they've
got six massive heat pipes spreading the
load around four heat sinks all with
these two chunky fans just chunky mean
James put that in there apparently it's
cool we need all of that del wasn't
lying when they said this is a desktop
processor so if you didn't get the 9900
K from the factory you'll have no
problem just plopping one in and
assuming the standards don't change too
much the GPU should be upgradeable to
like to be clear this isn't a standard
desktop GPU it's kind of like a
spiritual successor to MXM developed
in-house by Dell but with any luck this
will be upgradable to an RT X 21 Series
or whatever Nvidia decides to call it
next but with all this desktop grade
hardware and such a small package like
relatively speaking compared to just a
desktop was Alienware able to bend the
laws of thermodynamics and really
deliver that full desktop performance
well not quite but they did get damn
close although the area 51 M just losing
basically every test that we threw out
it compared to the MSI Triton X it
didn't fall very far behind like it's
pretty much within the margin of error
and it absolutely destroys every laptop
we've ever tested in CPU tests the i9
9900 K absolutely shreds the Asus GX 701
and like even with that having a blowing
with Tron strapped to it and also
comfortably outpaces the AMD 2700 in the
Acer Helios 500 as for GPU performance
well we just published a video titled
the fastest gaming laptop we've ever
tested both the Zephyrus and the area 51
M is just whooping it like this thing is
a cell of 15 percent faster in 3d mark
and even better in games like the
processor holy crap this thing is fast
it's just like any frame yeah I know
it's really great ok we know it's
powerful but have you been telling the
viewers the whole story - yes so when
you got those test result
it's how hot exactly was the processor a
a hundred degrees uh-huh and how fast
were the fan spinning but at max all
right all right get out of here listen I
got something to say all right I'm gonna
tell you what the area 51 M is actually
like to live with so first of all going
anywhere with it is basically a fool's
errand like it's got not one but two
power brakes and like Alex said this one
here alone weighs a quarter pound more
than the surface laptop and you need
these bricks it does have a 90 watt hour
battery close to the maximum allowed on
a plane so they can't exactly make it
bigger but with power-hungry components
like we have here you'll be lucky to
stay away from the wall for more than
two and a half hours then there's the
performance mode which just literally
pins the fans all the time which is
great for performance but it's really
loud meaning you'll be regularly going
to the control center between tasks to
pick your poison lower performance or
super noisiness and speaking of noise
that's pretty much the only thing these
speakers make like they get loud but
above about 50% volume the whole thing
just becomes a muddled mess which is
particularly annoying since Alienware
has traditionally had awesome speakers
another thing that area 51 M boasts is
Toby eye-tracking a technology that
tracks where your eyes are looking on
the screen to occasionally do cool
things but mostly to do literally
nothing due to poor support in games and
to be clear I don't want to put down
having this as a feature but it's just
unfortunate that despite this laptop
having IR and eye tracking that it also
doesn't support Windows hello facial
recognition for faster unlocking or even
just a simple fingerprint scanner this
is the kind of thing that should just be
here on a laptop that's this expensive
and will make everyday use just that
much more smooth although at least they
did manage to fit it with a half decent
webcam unlike the trackpad which is just
a big load of suck not using windows
precision drivers gives it that
synaptics drunken driver feel
hmm and even despite its small size I've
still had some palm rejection issues I
do appreciate the two dedicated buttons
and the glass top feels nice but bad
scrolling mediocre
gesture support and subpar tracking all
mean a real mouse will definitely be
your friend while using the area 51 m
and the keyboard don't get me started
the lighting on these secondary keys
would not pass razors QA but I do have
to give Alienware some real credit for
this keyboard in general the strokes are
surprisingly long and although tactile
also very smooth of all the gaming
laptops on the market Alienware might
have the best keyboards easily beating
razer msi and even a soos exactly it is
awesome
not as a laptop maybe but as a desktop
replacement and that's what this
actually is so the real question is
should you buy one well honestly it was
my $4,500 as much as I think the area 51
M is really cool I just get a desktop
and a surface laptop but I say that
having the luxury of a good place to put
a desktop and lots of people just don't
maybe you're a co-op student who get
whisked off way to any city with little
notice or someone who travels a lot for
business or just generally don't have
the space or stability for a full
desktop setup so if that's you and you
have loads of cash to throw down and the
earth doin em is going to make you feel
like a badass every time you open it up
and speaking of a badass when you open
it up I fix it the new line of marlin
screwdrivers is fixed blade and features
an ergonomic knurled rubberized handle
with a swivel top plus a black oxide
coated tip so it hangs onto those tiny
screws with a steel grip the lid of the
set is held in place magnetically and
can be also used as a serving tray and
it's all manufactured in Germany and
backed by I fix its lifetime warranty
even using I fix it for years and it
just makes building pcs repairing
electronics taking apart this laptop
just a breeze so get the Marlin
screwdriver set for $24.99 at ifixit.com
4 slash Lynas today so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
