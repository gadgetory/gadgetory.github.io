before mass production here for what I
think are fairly obvious reasons so I'm
going to begin this video with a warning
that goes a little something like this
understand the risks involved in backing
crowdfunded or indie projects before
pre-ordering a century because I can
assure you that if you're a small
form-factor enthusiast it's going to be
pretty hard to resist the siren call of
doctors neighbors creation over here
let's get down to business
mass drop is featuring the sunjack light
stick with a maximum output of 350
lumens a 5200 milliamp hour internal
battery as well as an ip68 water
resistance rating check it out at the
link in the video description alright so
as disappointing as steamos ended up
being the box that valve sent out to the
press to demo it showed us that a
console sized full-fat gaming rig could
be done and served as the inspiration
for the case that i have in front of me
at 7 litres total volume the sentry is
still considerably larger than the
PlayStation 4 is four and a half litres
but it is actually a little bit smaller
than the original Xbox ones 7.22 litres
making it truly a console sized PC
chassis that punches way above its size
class' and punch it does
unlike other grassroots tiny case
projects that we've checked out the dann
case a for SFX an N case m1 come to mind
which are both built in lee and lee's
factory out of anodized aluminum the
sentry is built out of one millimeter
galvanized steel with structural powder
coating in black or white giving it
substantial weight considering its
diminutive size as well as an industrial
look that I can personally appreciate
but that might be a turn-off for some at
the front as a pair of USB 3 ports and a
power button with a colored LED ring the
top is vented the bottom is vented with
a couple extra holes here to secure the
regrettably non optional stand that
allows the power supply and CPU heatsink
to breathe when the Sentry is mounted
vertically the left panel is vented over
the graphics card and the right panel is
similar with the openings over the power
supply and CPU fan area around back is
where folks not familiar with the size
of the Xbox one will get their first
real feel for how tiny this thing is
that's your graphics card IO a
pass-through power cable and your
motherboard IO this case
couldn't really be any smaller without
sacrificing over height video card
compatibility let's get it open it
really is quite similar to the steam
machine prototype the ITX motherboard
goes here CPU heatsink height is
restricted to 47 millimeters or 37
millimeters depending on the layout of
your motherboard the video card mount
using this clever pressure retention
system for the PCIe slot extension that
is both easy to align and user
replaceable if you had another one that
you liked better or you're stopped
working very clever the power supply
goes here you can choose s FX or s FX L
depending on your two and a half inch
drive appetite and you know what I could
cover every scenario but the Sentry's
hardware compatibility is much easier to
represent with this awesome little
configuration tool on their website that
lets you try out your components ahead
of time and see how well they will all
fit together very cool the assembly
instructions are surprisingly
straightforward to follow and building
in the century only took me about 15
minutes I do have some comments though
the manual suggests flipping the grill
on your power supply if it interferes
with the side panel but I just removed
mine outright just make sure to keep
your fingers out of it after the fact or
you could literally die it also suggests
running cables after installing the
power supply but if you're using a
modular SFX L unit like I was you'll
find that this is about as much fun as
performing surgery with a butter knife
and you'll risk damaging the wires
connected to the front power button so I
would suggest plugging in ahead of time
and finally what is it with Europeans
and hex screws why are we using hex
screws particularly ones with such low
steel content as to make them basically
not magnetic I can live without Philips
head but please at least fix the
magnetism in the mass production units
if possible anyway you can use the
cables included with your power supply
make sure they're long enough to route
where needed and then bunch up the extra
length near the end of the video card
that worked pretty well but with that
said I quickly swapped those out for
custom length ones from cable
which made my life and cable management
a little bit easier something that's
particularly important for cases like
this one that have no built-in fans
whatsoever I mean where would they even
put them I actually wouldn't mind
spacing of the vent holes on the right
panel to allow me to squeeze a 40
millimeter fan in wherever I wanted like
if they just change the spacing so that
it kind of always lined up wherever you
go that would be kind of cool but that's
about it I can't find anywhere else and
besides does it need them well to find
out I loaded up the sentry with a 22
core 145 watt TDP Xeon CPU 64 gigs of
ram a GTX Titan XP a 1 terabyte 850 Pro
SSD and a 700 watt SF XL power supply
this is about as fully loaded
worst case scenario a configuration as
you can possibly get and to be very
clear will not be representative of what
most people will be running though I do
plan to follow this up with a more
realistic configuration compared to some
other small form-factor cases in the
future but let's start with a baseline
reading here for our torture
configuration so with the chassis
mounted vertically and the panels off to
represent how this Hardware should
behave on an open bench the CPU
throttles already it was pretty hot that
day but GPU boost clocks look pretty
good with the panels on GPU clock speeds
do fall and chassis temperatures are
very toasty especially around back where
the GPU exhaust is located bear in mind
that this is all on auto with
independent synthetic tests running on
the CPU and GPU so under a more gaming
like realistic load and with some tuning
of the GPUs fan profile allowing it to
ramp up higher than default I was
actually able to generate these results
pretty darn impressive if you can
control CPU heat dump and you don't mind
a little bit of noise it's actually not
that bad the Sentry can handle pretty
much whatever video card you can throw
at it flipping the chassis horizontally
does hamper its abilities somewhat
making the GPU fail
I'm work a little over 10% harder right
off the bat and I would strongly
recommend the vertical orientation with
the stand with high-end hardware which
is all fine and good for components that
have fans but what about the system
components that don't have their own
active cooling well here the story gets
a little bit less happy though not
impossible to solve my SSD ran at 62
degrees on the surface of the drive
mounted near the video card so I'd
strongly recommend using the alternate
mount that's next to the GPU intake that
was pointed out to me by the dr. Xavier
guys but more alarming than that my ram
chips and motherboard chipset were well
over 70 degrees each this isn't instant
death territory but it's hotter than I
think a lot of people would be
comfortable with so bottom line I
wouldn't recommend my configuration here
but a more sensible config with a flower
style CPU cooler like Intel's box cooler
would absolutely rock in this baby
because it would help the RAM and the
motherboard stay quite a bit cooler I
mean as long as you're not running
multiple synthetic loads you may still
be okay anyway even an open-air style
ACX
2.0 cooler 980ti generated better gaming
results surprisingly than a blower style
reference card at the cost of CPU temps
however and when not using the GPU and a
69 50 X 10 core managed to stator bowed
up encoding video full-bore an Adobe
Media encoder if I wasn't doing anything
with the GPU I think they're going to
sell a lot of these although it remains
to be seen what exactly the small
production run pricing is going to look
like
speaking of outlandish prices have you
ever looked at your cell phone bill and
gone I mean yeah there's a lot of stuff
included with this but I'm paying a lot
of money and I don't actually use half
of it well if you have then maybe check
out ting the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction
first you will not speak to a robot if
you call ting and the best part about it
is that you pay only for what you use
with the average ting bill coming in at
only
23 bucks a month per device but don't
take my word for it head over to linus
dot ting dot-com and check out their
savings calculator you enter your last
couple of bills you enter how much
you're paying and it spits out how much
you would save by switching to ting and
if you're stuck in a contract they'll
actually cover 25% of your cancellation
fee up to $75 and they've got new lower
mobile data rates across the board with
data at now only $10 per gigabyte beyond
the first gig so try it out and if you
sign up using our link you'll also get
25 bucks in service credit or towards a
new device we've got that link in the
video description all right so thanks
for watching guys that this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
totally join now that you're done doing
all that stuff you're probably wondering
