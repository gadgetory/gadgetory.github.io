touchscreen secured by router that this
is part of some technology in order to
achieve its retinas and its range of
tenderness so what they're going for
here is the most intuitive possible way
to configure it sorry I'll stop that now
the most intuitive possible way to
configure your settings without a PC or
Mac so yes the world's first wireless
touchscreen router and it's actually a
lot cooler than it even sounds and it
sounds pretty cool so I'll get him
tomorrow that later secure so you
benefit from pre-configured security
cool it's fast using three hundred
megabit per second 802.11 and MIMO
technology on the 2.4 gigahertz band
connect up to 50 is time cool stuff
elegant all your info is just a finger
tap away so let's open this up and touch
on some of the obvious and less obvious
advantages hello as a router it's more
for the less tech-savvy crowd I mean
that probably goes without saying
because I can't imagine you know like
the Cisco Networking certified dude
wanting to configure as router like this
that it is just not how it works that's
not how it's gonna happen however for
your grandma or your grandpa or your mom
and your dad this might be simpler than
trying to be on the phone for me like
can you please enter 192.168.0.1 in the
browser URL bar they're like what okay
if you'd like push the thing on the
thing that might be easy to explain I
mean I haven't used it yet so I can't
say for sure but I'm definitely going to
be trying this out included accessories
are your power cable okay your Ethernet
cable and we've also got a Quick Start
Guide so apparently I only needed like
one small piece of paper in order to
achieve that so almond does a router
okay do this about the evening it's only
four steps and it includes unplugging
your old thing
very thorough wait for one minute do
this wait for one minute do this and
follow the on-screen instructions on the
right because you can just follow
on-screen instructions as like a screen
right on it range extender okay so there
are some tips and tricks for where to oh
this is hilarious check this out so
there's the support number and then
under that it says coming soon he so
sorry sorry sorry so there's some tips
for where to locate it so even for tech
savvy people I can imagine something
like this being awesome for use as a
range extender because I don't know if
you guys have ever done it before but I
have whether it's a powerline range
extender or a wireless range extender
they're actually kind of a pain to set
up because you have to authenticate them
you have to follow like the wizard on
the disc or you have to figure out how
to manually configure it and you gotta
figure out a part of the security going
I couldn't even get the powerline one
working and I don't know if that was
because I'm not using similar powerline
gear on my network or if maybe I
completely misunderstood what the point
of the product was but now we've sort of
launched off onto a tangent this should
be very easy because you can actually
configure everything you need on the
touch screen itself when it comes to
setting up a range extender so the
outside shell of it is actually quite
slick it's follows sort of with the
general trend of routers which is to
make it glossy which is sort of a shame
but if it was matte then it would be
absolutely perfect in every way in terms
of aesthetic here's the cool thing as
well no I'll talk about that later
so ventilation is handled passively so
it has little feet that it stands on so
there's lots of room underneath for air
to come up through the unit and then be
not passively exhausted from the top
in terms of ports because of its small
size you've got your your LAN port your
internet port and then two LAN ports
that's fine don't worry about it you can
always break out to a switch and then
run cables to your individual pcs you
got your power in as well as your your
hardware reset button and then on what
would typically be the front there's
nothing and then on the real front there
is an LCD screen so what's cool about
the LCD screen is that truly that it has
the potential to do things like act as a
photo viewer now wait hold on see looks
giving me a look right now - that's
totally useless and normally I would say
yes that is totally useless however
think about
in this context what do you normally do
with your router you plug everything
into it you kind of bundle it all up and
then you might hide it under your desk
what does that do to your wireless
signal strength what if your router
looked nice and could sit up on your
desk in a better position for wireless
reception that would be a good thing
right so there you go
not totally crazy and you know I'm not
just totally crazy so let's get it boot
it up here just see what we can see so
you're gonna be exploring with us in
real time what this thing's all about
look at that four different languages
I'm gonna go with English please wait
applying language Wow responsive
touchscreen actually I was expecting to
have to like kind of mash on it but it's
not a super cheap touchscreen or
anything like that so they wanted me to
say that you know speeds and specs are
good but this is more for you know the
non tech savvy people you know so you
won't be bothered whenever our passwords
forgotten so you can you can give this
to someone knowing that you're not gonna
be harassed about it basically later ah
the wizard so um start missing stylus is
located at the bottom of your almond no
way it comes with a spy oh there it is
look at that even notice it's bad stylus
in case you need it
okay so we're gonna use it just for the
sake of yeah argument would need it okay
how do you want to use it I want to use
it as a range extender okay see how easy
this is okay so look at that that was
fast so here's all the available um so
you see why Wireless doesn't work in the
tech tips room guys because this is how
many stupid wireless things are in I
believe it's this one yeah this is how
many stupid wireless networks are within
range of here there's so much
interference that we can't get anything
done and I totally like leaked on the
screen there that's disgusting sorry my
bad so this one doesn't have any
security however I think we can
extrapolate based on how easy this
process was so far that it's probably
pretty similar let me just check my
other notes for this video make sure
that I'm not forget
anything cuz yes I do do notes you know
I can't always remember everything so
they're gonna have a weather app as well
just kind of cool that's coming so you
shouldn't feel the need to tuck it away
so where this is Internet's disconnected
so it gives me some little you know
information and whatnot I just click
finish and then from there okay cool so
you can configure stuff you can
oh whoops okay hold on you can do these
do apparently nothing okay there's a
browser no way oh no that's just the
thing with the Diagnostics web admin
screens he can time it oh you can turn
it off if you want you can put on a
screen lock to protect it web admin to
use the web interface point to your
browser
oh cool okay status neat Wow you can
actually do everything on here that's
cool let's see if there's more
connection statistics firmware upgrades
huh hold on sec guys
and I think we're kind of done here so
we're gonna be taking a closer look at
this on NCIX tech tips but there you go
it's the router that you can kind of put
somewhere it looks kind of nice and yeah
I'm sort of fascinated by it don't
