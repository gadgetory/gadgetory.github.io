would recommend this but uh all of us PC
building tech dudes already know about
thermal paste okay aka the hot stuff aka
the gray goo aka Grammys old sandwich
spread what but what if you're outta
thermal paste yeah you could just go
order more picks them up from NCI X or
you could make your own
- actually got an email from a fan
suggesting we do this so in this video
we are going back to chemistry class and
finding out whether any of these
materials can work as a thermal paste
substitute because Linus isn't here and
he can't stop us but I do have Alex here
to make sure that I don't blow up this
PC with Nutella because that that's a
real possibility what
the hex gears impulse mechanical
keyboard has RGB lighting a variety of
different key switches and IP 56 water
resistance so it can survive some of
your worst spills use offer code LTT to
save $10 at the link below as Alex could
tell you but I will instead there's two
main things fuck guys I'm not Linus till
we get there sadly okay so the main
purpose of thermal paste is to assist
the heat transfer between the CPU and
the heatsink when you put them together
because you put them together but
there's still a little bit of gaps in
between so what do we need thermal paste
to do what are the two main
qualifications we're looking for so I
guess the first one is that needs to be
really easily spreadable so like you
have all this little dips and stuff and
you want to just fill those in you don't
want to be creating like a layer between
your CPU and your heatsink right and the
other thing is that it has to be really
good thermally conductive so you don't
have just like a bunch of resistance
between the two hmm you want that heat
to be transferred yeah okay so with
those qualifications there are a large
number of materials that we could
potentially use with varying
efficiencies so what do we have here
okay so some of you might be familiar
with this toothpaste a lot of people
have tried it and we're not gonna try it
by itself today because it's been tried
a lot but it's actually a surprisingly
effective substitute the problem is that
it's got fluoride in it and that means
it's slightly corrosive and it also
tends to dry out very easily so what
we're gonna mix it with thanks to some
tips on the Internet is petroleum jelly
aka Vaseline but this is the no-name
brand you can really bad stuff why is
bad it's chunky oh that's true
but if we mix it together I don't know I
mean this is a smooth type of toothpaste
because the main thing when you're using
toothpaste you don't want the the gritty
kind with like the little beads in it or
whatever I'll just do it we just do it
yeah I wanted to do it okay you could oh
dear yes maybe
I feel like that's slightly dangerous
what you're a monster Alex what CPU is
this also
that's a 79 80 XE so maybe we don't want
to get toothpaste a like a $2,000
process you're supposed to rein me in
I'm not supposed to rein you in what are
we doing here ah I don't know it seems
to be working okay like I don't think
it's the way that you thought that we
are true well I think we're about good
like okay yeah you want to try it like
that yep the wrong way all right well
you've made your bed and now we're gonna
lie in it I guess so I'm guessing that
you've already done the testing I ran a
baseline with real thermal paste and I
also ran it
bareback as they say did you find a
board that doesn't have a power button
on it
no it has a power button ready whoa it's
on it works yes so we just got a boot it
up and then run I to 60 for a little bit
and stress test it and see whether the
computer will explode that's how we know
right yeah yeah all right I had a 64 um
where do we have the weight it should
come up automatically because I'm a
prime a programmer I'm a big big tech
hacker look at that oh jeez Oh fancy
see that's what the toothpaste does oh
that's pretty good
like 20 degrees idling very nice
what was our baseline head over to
documents they're back in baseline so
baseline we're looking at a max of about
65 degrees package go up to 70 hottest
for 65 bareback we are looking at
hundred and four degrees yep that's not
good yeah when I did the bareback it
just shot right up it past a hundred so
so let's see here toothpaste and
Vaseline
looking actually not bad with CPU
package is already at 68 hottest core
okay so we're at 65 already so we're not
beating thermal paste that is for sure
things go real slow in your stress test
in the CPU that's what I learned and
which I already know it's only like five
degrees over like actual thermal paste
those so it's a way better option than
just not having anything that's very
true so if you're like really in a bind
you're like I gotta get my old my dad's
old Dell from when I was a small child
up and running immediately right now not
bad not horrible one of them got up to
79 that's too hot
I wouldn't go outside if it was that hot
so that one was kind of a joke all right
guys but this next one actually might
work as a real substitute because what
we're using is silicon grease Thorne
Lube it's wet Oh ring Lube it's a ring
loop and that's not something dirty it's
just things that you use for o-rings
yeah yeah so we're actually combining
silicon grease with drum roll please
Diamond powder
cool I didn't even know that was a thing
but it is so we're basically using the
diamond as the thermal conductor and the
silicon grease as the medium for that
material we're not just throwing this on
okay we're gonna mix it properly this is
a science this is a science laboratory
and I won't stand for your nonsense so
before if you're gonna deal with diamond
powder at all guys we need masks alright
and I'm really glad that Alex brought
that up yeah let's do that I would have
remembered about the masks okay yeah
after you started coughing
so this is what 0 to 100
don't open it yet 0 to 1 micron diamond
powder I guess this is traditionally
used for like polishing mirrors no it's
25 carat 25 carat oh okay
so the ratio we're supposed to use is
around 60/40 whatever that means I'm
just gonna eyeball it them yep
papa Alex so is this kind of just like
making icy diamond like icy diamond has
diamonds in it right yeah and it kind of
looks like it - do you think we need
more grease in there yeah maybe a bit
should I be wearing gloves it's probably
got some icy diamond for comparison oh
wow that's dark yeah this is a lot
thicker than other thermal pastes
so how much did this diamond powder cost
for that package it was like 15 bucks or
something oh this is also a super weird
application well you're taking your mask
off yeah what are you doing the dust
isn't around anymore we're good oh no
science class is not in session anymore
well except for the science for doing
this yeah except for the except for this
yeah we do what we must because we can
that is a proverb and a half right there
all right so idle looking like 30
degrees that feels like it's higher than
what it was last time but uh the diamond
powder and the silicon grease is uh
there's a little bit more of a practical
alternative you're not just like trying
to get something up and running right
away you're like you know what screw the
system I'm making my own thermal paste
I'm growing my own tomatoes in my
backyard that's that's what that's who
this is for yeah but it's working really
bad this is like when you when you try
and make tomatoes in your backyard and
then you know the deers eat them and
yeah and it ends up that you weren't
even growing tomatoes the whole time
they were like you'll actually weed yeah
all right so this here is my idea I've
got some rapid tap you want to use rapid
tap instead of silicon grease yeah okay
well if the problem also could be that
our diamonds are just too big and we
need smaller ones
ever be too big did you imagine just
having a great big diamond I also don't
know if rapid tap is electrically
conductive it probably is so we
definitely will not want to be getting
this on anywhere that's not the CPU okay
I guess we're about good to go for this
thing cool for your your my Lou Beacon
culture this was not endorsed by my
internet sources so no guarantees that
it will perform as well as our homemade
diamond paste I think it's gonna be
better this is actually like how you
would use this normally you'd like
combine it with an oil and then spread
it out on like a surface plate and
polish something speaking of which do
you want to do that after I do what I'm
seeing 67 77 I think your diamond faces
like it's worse than toothpaste and
petroleum jelly by quite a bit yes good
so don't go up by in diamonds just use
your freaking toothpaste
you know diamonds are kind of useless
like they cost a lot and they don't
really do anything except look pretty I
thought this would be one functional
application bye see you later see you
later
I think mustard is going to destroy this
oh my gosh you know you put your faith
in something and then it just lets you
down yeah and then you go all the way
down hit rock bottom and try it mustard
there we go starting the test
I see 47 52 57 58 we're still living
better than the diamond at this point 63
so basically condiments are way better
than diamond powder well okay we just
had 74 but it's like this is usable this
is an 18 core processor you know what
this means we got to build a
liquid-cooled PC just using condiments
well it works so great with concrete so
yeah I think we can call that basically
a win for mustard all right well so it
seems like anything besides diamond
paste as far as last-minute things go
not the worst surprisingly okay let's
move on so the thing about Nutella it's
the only stuff here that I kind of want
to eat so that's actually not coming off
how do you get mustard off any nice soap
we've cooked the mustard on to the metal
now we're gonna now we're in a bit of a
pickle what okay well hold on hold on
hold on it's wet dude it's dripping yeah
exactly because we need to get it off
but what about this so let's just kind
of pack that around the CPU ah alex is
supposed to keep me in check for this
video I have find myself stress look if
we wreck this board it's your fault oh
that's fine I think it's all good it's
only like a little bit of water that's
around there now and it's basically all
gone so yes this is what we thought
would do better than mustard I'm not so
confident
anymore you know being a cameraman is
hard work I understand I here you go
David yeah yeah there you go
how's that that was weird
in a university while I was studying for
exams one time I just like downed a
whole bottle of Nutella much like I had
it there just like with the spoon and
then I'm threw up violently and I didn't
need Nutella for like six or so years
after that you do weird things
Nutella addiction is a scourge a skirt
it's no joke
let's see if Nutella is really gets
results that are just as nutty as it is
okay so we're looking already at 52
degrees up to 60 I see 63 65 71 okay
this is nothing he's good at custard so
I wasn't really joking when I said we
might blow up the PC with Nutella
no it might be worse than diamond paste
everything is terrible I guess sugar and
fat content isn't everything maybe we
should just put a frere roche just like
right in the middle there's the point
okay now actually I'm expecting this to
maybe do okay because it's 40% zinc
oxide is that good which is the main
ingredient in some thermal pastes and I
don't know why
zinc oxide would be helpful to baby bums
but it might be helpful to this baby bum
right here all right
okay
16900 not not worse than mustard mustard
we're one degree off from mustard though
I think that we might find out that
mustard is your best bet like mustard is
probably better than some budget thermal
pastes so this is officially worse than
mustard for like a few minutes for
diaper rash cream yeah true
it is diaper rash cream and it's not
gonna dry out we're only six degrees up
yeah six degrees isn't too bad I really
did not think any of this
Hey what is that you want to whoa that
right there is a lapping plate this is
so heavy
what are we gonna do with this oh let's
steal so take it right on top well what
like the whole point of thermal paste is
to fill in the gaps but what if there
were no gaps yeah much like should be
tender dates everywhere we are going to
just try and do it with no thermal paste
and I didn't say that quite right yeah
whenever I go on dates and they don't
have thermal paste man I'm just gone
yeah we need just a little bit of this
polishing compound polishing compound is
that like diamond powder
yeah diamond powder actually is a
polishing compound of sorts gonna just
throw some rapid tap in here
Kabam do a little stir yeah now we just
have to put it on lock and plate and go
him very rhythmic you're essentially
grinding down the surface of the
heatsink block yes so that it's smooth
as a baby's bottom
smooth air even if you want to get the
CPU uh-oh
so wait you're gonna drag the CPU across
that yep that's that's the plan I didn't
know that
adding Alex to this video would make it
more off the walls
Wow that's turning into just call for
now all of the protective coating is
just leaving so I'm going to need to
step up to a lower grip but higher
cutting power
I have never done CPU laughing before it
is a thing that lots of people do to
improve performance we aren't doing this
to improve performance but we're doing
it to prove that protection is for the
weak yeah people please don't have that
bigger takeaway here
I don't feel amazing about this
things weren't quite as flat as I
thought that they were at the beginning
so we've had to take off a lot more
material than I thought I'm afraid that
were still quite a ways off of being
flat so like you can see kind of like
here we haven't even touched it with the
surface plate yet and right there as
well
so that means that there are really big
high spots there and there so kind of
like around the edges here and in the
center was a lot higher than like
because we'll be contacting the silicon
around here and then read around the die
it was higher I'm a bit concerned about
how much crap I got all over the CPU we
run like these little resistors here I'm
not sure how I'm gonna get that out on
the other edge there's like it's just
kind of all over the place I'm not
totally sure what to do I think that
Riley brought me in so that things
wouldn't be dying like geez this is um
I'm not totally sure how many people
would recommend this but uh I certainly
we and we haven't even told Linus we're
doing this so hopefully the other thing
is that when you use water and you like
put it all over a processor the water
can kind of stick around so you want to
just dunk it in alcohol first and then
that that was shows it away and we
should be good to go
definitely do that I have no doubts that
this will work flawlessly good me too
some time to play with a $2,000
processor hopefully you didn't break it
here we go was this worth all the
killing the processor we we will find in
questionable for sure but wasn't worth
it for the views though if we get them
yeah everyone's gone we got into the
BIOS yep didn't kill it
excellent boo-boo so we're idling at
about twenty twenty eight degrees or so
which is about the same as last time so
we might be able to actually beat like
Nutella or diamond paste using though
being ATO that's that's climbing fast
right that's bombing really fast o beat
the diamond paste eighty nine we still
have a little bit of room still a little
bit ninety it's a really similar
trajectory to the diamond paste
ninety-three C but that's what's that's
so surprising like why was the diamond
paste so bad I don't know because this
is bareback and it's it's doing very
similar this is nothing and it's doing
very similarly so it's back down to like
ninety three degrees so okay flattening
it did help a bit it seems to be better
than the diamonds but uh so if you want
to keep under load you know you want to
keep it in a nice frosty ninety four
then flattening is yeah it's great good
to go but I guess if you actually want
to keep the cool toothpaste in petroleum
jelly excellent option yeah diaper rash
cream also pretty good if you have it
around not horrible
mustard surprising winner but also don't
toast it and surprisingly diamond powder
with anything not as good as we thought
so I see diamond must have some sort of
like secret you know secret recipe or
something yeah or it's just way finer
than what we had
I don't know at the end of the day you
know we found that some materials can
actually work for a hot minute or
minutes but on the whole you probably
want to use thermal paste so if you're
if you're really desperate you might
turn to something else but for the most
part just go to the store pick up some
thermal paste order some thermal paste
like 15 bucks on crime probably it's not
bad guys something else you might want
to pick up is the sound core infini Pro
buy anchor the infinii Pro is a 2.1
channel sound bar with Dolby Atmos an
immersive 3d audio technology that
doesn't just pump sound at you but above
and around you the infinite Pro uses two
built-in subwoofers with base up
technology to produce booming lows then
fills out the sound with two full range
speakers and two tweeters and with the
ability to pass 4k HDR signals through
to your TV and wirelessly stream audio
from your phone or tablet the infinite
Pro is one of the best value dolby atmos
speakers conceived by humankind so check
it out at the link in the description
alright guys that's it for this video
Alex has already given up and gone right
back to eating Nutella
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome hit that like
button get subscribed and click the link
in the video's description to check out
some of the things we've featured in
this video I guess yeah you can go buy
some toothpaste also linked down in the
