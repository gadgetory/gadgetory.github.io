another network media player we have the
seagate freeagent theater plus this is
an HD media player it is fully 1080p
ready basically it allows you to access
content from your home network much like
a lot of these other network media
accessories so first of all you've got
your list of what's in the box which
will be showing you soon enough so
there's no need to read that you've got
minimum system requirements which are
very very conservative 256 megs round is
pretty much it and a USB port okay so
that's not too bad it's got the
supported formats which does include
rmvb as well as MKV so some of the
pretty important ones are there subtitle
support and resolutions up to 1080p let
me see you can do jpeg photos if you
wanted to do that and supports both pal
and ntsc so let's get this thing open
and yeah there we go so first of all we
take off the plastic yeah oh yeah one of
the cool features while I'm unboxing
this thing if I could just get the
plastic started maybe something sharp
would be helpful is actually the ability
to dock a seagate external hard drive
into the so where a lot of these
media players have support for USB hard
drive on the outside or for an internal
hard drive like the popcorn hour this
one actually supports the use of an
external hard drive internally if you
catch my drift so let's take this open
and I'll show you exactly what I mean
first of all you're going to find a
quick start guide which based on how
stiff it is also include the CD so we'll
see what it says the CD is for in just a
moment so here's your Quick Start Guide
they want you to check and make sure you
have everything connecting HDMI
connection or something else connect to
ethernet and plug in the power at this
point you can also insert a free agent
go hard drive so that's a
two-and-a-half-inch external hard drive
and take advantage of that or you can
use an external USB port to any drive
enclosure here are some instructions for
how to use the media sync software and d
remote control okay so here's your free
agent theater plus HD media player
solution this is what you need to
install on the server computer then
you've got your warranty information
okay and then you have updated oh
they're telling you you want to update
your firmware as frequently as possible
but make sure that you get the latest
from Seagate's website okay here we go
so it's a little bit bigger than you
know what let's do the accessories first
actually I changed our minds okay first
you got your power brick pretty standard
thing they come with a plug on one end
and a different plug on the other end
okay that's good then you've got a
composite cable okay it looks like about
a six foot cable for you I probably and
then you have a component video cable
okay sounds great and oh it comes with
oh no it doesn't come with an hdmi cable
so that is a bit of a small knock
against it but it does come with kind of
a fancy-looking ethernet cable with
metal on the sides okay so there's an
ethernet cable and to triple-a batteries
for the remote actually the remote can
make or break these devices so this is
not nearly as advanced a remote as
something like the popcorn hours but
it's a little bit better than what comes
with the wdtv live so you just have kind
of your basic functionality it's a
little on the big side I guess
considering the buttons looks like
there's a lot of empty space but that's
going to give you pretty much what you
need to do to navigate the menus placed
off forward rewind mute etc okay so now
let's have a look at the unit itself Oh
something that we should probably
mention is you can see that this
packaging is green it is well not green
is brown but it's recycled recycled
materials so they are saving the
environment one package at a time so
take the plastic off the top it doesn't
come off in one piece because you can
see here on the right that's the hatch
for installing aha a two and a half inch
drive so you can see it's just a USB
connection at the back so that both
powers the drive and provides your data
transfer and you can remove or put on
this cover as needed it's quite a sleek
looking unit is quite a bit bigger than
the wdtv live but I really like the
front of it it's very clean-looking you
basically got one USB port and one is
that a power switch I think it's a power
switch can't tell it doesn't seem to
have much of a switch you feel to it but
that'll be in the instructions one way
or another okay so there's your AV out
there is your component out optical
audio hdmi
LAN USB and power there's a hard reset
switch on the back so that pretty much
covers our unboxing of the seagate
freeagent theater plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
