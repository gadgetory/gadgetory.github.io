like this you can see crazy Russian so
he wanted me to say that this is 0.85
gigahertz which it is this is the EVGA
GTX 580 FTW hydro copper - so it is for
the win which means that it is an e
BGA's highest tier of overclocked highly
binned chips okay so it's a for the win
it is hydro which means that it uses
liquid cooling it is copper which should
be fairly self-explanatory and it is -
so it must be the second one so the
first thing we see on the front of the
box is at EVGA is the number one seller
of Nvidia based products in the u.s.
they're very proud of that and so they
should be we have 3d vision surround
support physics direct 11 SLI CUDA a
bunch of stuff that's not on here maven
three-way and four-way SLI is supported
by this particular card let's see what
EVGA has to say for themselves on the
back it does support their precision
tool for overclocking as well as their
free OC scanner so this precision in
particular is a very very useful little
little feature we have full support for
3d vision including 3d vision surround
okay so I did mention that before I
didn't think I did but actually I had
already alright let's open this up and
we've got some feel to break here that
is something that I do like to do just
got that run in the background there
okay let's break the seal and have a
look at this very fast very expensive
graphics card so comes with its sleeve
this is more of a traditional older
style video card box alright
then a box which will contain nothing
there maybe this was here maybe this was
also here maybe these are supposed to be
here see let's try it like this and see
if that works better see what what if I
opened it like that okay that doesn't
really maybe that's why they didn't put
them in there all right
hose clamps and barbs are provided to
properly position the Barban stop
fittings follow the diagram below okay
I'll explain that in a minute
all right we got one of those posters
I've shown you guys this a number of
times but I guess I'll show you again oh
no wait that's the same old lunch
nevermind let's call it a go okay so
let's this close mr. skull back up here
and there we are okay the next thing we
find inside is a bunch of useless stuff
basically that's how to install a
graphics card in a PCIe slot and the
driver disk which you shouldn't use you
should download the latest Nvidia comm
next we have our mini HDMI to HDMI cable
this is great because it means that if
you plug in a full size HDMI cable you
will not interfere with the DVI swot
that is next over we have dual 6 pin PCI
e2 8 pin PCIe adapter and a dual molex
to 6-pin PCI II adapter just in case the
power supply does not have native
support for this card we've got a DVI to
VGA adapter seriously you should not be
using that VGA out on a card of this
caliber just buy yourself a new monitor
already okay next we have Barb's alright
so for those of you who aren't familiar
with water cooling we've got a few
different things here we have two 1/2
inch stubby fittings barb fittings okay
so what makes some stubby is that
they're shorter than a traditional
longer barb okay what makes them
half-inch is the outer diameter of the
flange here on the barb and they've got
a rings in here to make sure that they
don't leak these are G 1/4 threaded so
they will be compatible with this and
most other blocks on the market you've
also got 3/8 Barb's so these are four if
you are running a 3/8 tubing inside your
water cooling loop I actually used three
it's tubing so these are the ones that I
would use in theory but I would probably
upgrade them into compressions
instead of Barb's these are stop
fittings so stop fittings go everywhere
where you don't put a barb so let's
explain that diagram real quick here
okay so you can either put them in this
way so you see the stop fittings there
so the water flows in around the loop
bla bla bla and then comes out here or
you can go this way so it's in from the
top and then go and comes out this way
so basically the stop fittings have to
always go opposite wherever you put a
barb so that it doesn't just flow
straight through without passing through
the block to cool the GPU and the RAM
and everything because this is a full
cover block weighs about oh wow that's
heavy
they weren't kidding when they said it
was made of copper so full cover blocks
pool not only the GPU itself which used
to be how we did video card water
cooling but also the memory power
delivery all of that good stuff full
cover blocks are pretty much the shizzle
I'm a big fan of full cover blocks and I
do run one in my own system at home I
actually did a video where I showed you
guys how to install a full-timer block
it's a bit of a process
so there is definitely something to be
said for buying a card like this from
EVGA which is bent higher than most GTX
580 s and also comes equipped with a
water block right out of the box which
means you don't have to install it you
don't have to worry about any
complications with your warranty from
installing it not to say EVGA won't
warranty you if you install a different
card but you know if you break it and
it's your own fault it certainly won't
be able to help you right so here we go
we've got a nickel-plated proper base
this is made by Swift tech you can see
here powered by swift tech it has a
Delrin top now Delvin has the advantage
of being more durable than acrylic so
the acrylic and element are the two main
materials that you see used for the tops
of blocks it is a less liable to crack
where you insert the barb so here I'm
going to throw a 3/8 inch barb in there
okay oh one of the other things of note
about this card is it a single slot
check that out
so there's your mini HDMI there's your
DVI there's your DVI and there's your
custom single slot PCI bracket so that
is a pretty awesome thing which means
you could in theory I mean if you were
doing like a folding rig install as many
as what like what's the highest number
six would be like a classified SR to
60-69 slots seven seven okay it's a
double yes it was okay you can install a
whole lot of these in one system at a
time should you so desire although you'd
have to get some custom fittings these
ones wouldn't quite work if you were
putting cards right next to each other
let's have a look at the back so it does
include EVGA a back plate for the GTX
580 this is not a custom PCB 580 it's
just a very highly Bend one that has a
custom cooler and a custom backplate on
it so you can see we've got little holes
for ventilation here and it's also
making contact probably with some of the
key components on the back that do need
to be cooled or maybe it's just for
looks
Steven making contact with anything
maybe this just for looks I actually
don't know interesting oK we've got two
sli fingers with support for two-way
three-way and four-way SLI on the bottom
we find our standard PCIe 16x slot
interface and moving over back to the
front we can just kind of look at the
card somewhere because it's a very very
slick slim sexy looking card looks great
that's pretty much all there is to it
it's like awesome oh yeah eight pin and
6 pin PCI e power connectors are needed
for this particular board and just so
you guys know you will need water
cooling you will need a water cooling
setup in order to run this card you
can't just buy this if you don't already
have liquid cooling so you're gonna want
a pumper radiator a reservoir and some
fans in order to make this function I
think that's pretty much it thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the GTX
580 ftw hydro copper 2 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus Texas from our
unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
also when you are fastening your Barb's
don't overdo it they should be kind of
once it starts to get snug turn it maybe
another quarter to half of a turn and
that is pretty much it you don't want to
rip the threads oh just my little water
cooling tip for you guys for the day
point 85 gigahertz</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
