show there was an article on VentureBeat
titled VR adoption among Steam users has
crashed to a halt Linus was all like
what and I wasn't actually surprised and
I explained my theory as to why it was
happening but that doesn't mean I was
happy about it I speculated that it was
due to the marketing issues behind
explaining the experience to people that
were unable to try it for themselves the
total cost of ownership being very high
and finally that the inferior experience
of the gear VR which Samsung is
marketing like crazy has the potential
to leave people unsatisfied with the
gear VR and therefore uninterested in
other VR experiences in the car a couple
days later I heard a radio ad for the
Samsung gear VR this triggered some
trains of thought through my brain first
of which was concern for people that had
the type-c connector with their Galaxy
Note 7s and then going a little bit
deeper I began to question my original
rant on the LAN show who or what
actually killed VR Who am I supposed to
be mad at is it marketing is it cost is
it Samsung or is it oculus let's dig
deeper
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free in order to answer this
question we need to establish some data
points the main one of which being cost
of entry starting from nothing a gear vr
ranges from about four hundred and
seventy US dollars for a Galaxy S six
and a 2015 version of the gear VR to
about a thousand US dollars for a shiny
new note seven and a 2016 version of the
gear VR now one thing that hurts the
install base for gear VR is that it is
very unlikely that someone would buy a
phone solely for the purpose of playing
with their gear VR but in that same vein
especially with Apple's so-called
courageous abandonment of the headphone
jack this also helps them as it is very
likely that your next phone would be an
s6 and s6 edge and s6 edge plus a note
five a galaxy s7 and s7 edge or a note
seven all of which are compatible with
the new gear VR 2016 computers are
similar in this way but scaled up a bit
if you don't have a gaming PC yet you're
probably looking at about sixteen
hundred US dollars for a rig that meets
the recommended spec and an oculus rift
included slightly over three times the
from nothing cost of a gear VR and the
top-end well if you've ever watched any
of our videos I'm sure you know by now
when it comes to computers the sky isn't
the limit for cost it's more like
galaxies far far away on top of that
benchmarking VR is in its infancy so
choosing a VR computer is not only
prohibitively expensive but probably
also rather confusing for most people
now of course there are those of us with
computers fast enough to support VR
already but unfortunately that number
whatever it is is assuredly much much
lower than the number of people that
will already have a Samsung phone and
even a high-end one thanks to carrier
subsidies and even if the starting
install bases were equal that still
leaves desk
Villar at 600 to 800 dollars minimum for
a headset versus 70 to a hundred for a
gear VR now that we've established that
I need a couple people that aren't me or
anyone else at Linus Media Group
I need people with no experience with
desktop VR beyond the oculus development
kit one but who can appreciate
technology my plan was to have them try
a gear VR paired with an s7 edge with
darknet Temple Run and Eve Gun Jack give
their impressions to the camera and then
try an HTC vive with hollow-point audio
shield raw data and Google tilt brush
now there are a couple problems with
this test I could have changed the order
that they tried the headsets in instead
of having them go on a rising curve from
the gear VR up to the HTC vive I could
have had them go on a falling curve from
the vive down to the gear VR it's also
heavily app dependent I didn't show them
the oculus rift I didn't show them any
seated experience and the game
experiences aren't really apples to
apples as in I should have had them
demoed a Valkyrie considering they tried
gun jack
but worst of all my sample size it's
small and I should feel bad if this was
a proper study it would have probably
been a couple hundred people at least
but this wasn't a proper study and I
think we got our answer anyways it's
surprisingly simple money it's just too
damn expensive when all said and done
all the experience improvements and
health benefits mean nothing if people
just plain can't afford it after
everything when I asked them which one
they would choose between the two they
both chose to my utter dismay prefer the
gear I have to give it to the gear VR
neither of my subjects had VR ready P
C's also unsurprisingly they both had
Samsung phones compatible with the gear
VR 1600 plus US dollars is a hard pill
to swallow when you could just pass over
a hundred bucks and get part of the way
there even if I would argue that it's
not close at all in terms of quality of
experience it's also not that close in
terms of cost and your
are able to shed the cable allowing you
to take it with you on trips and stuff
as well though to be fair I did hear
from one of my test subjects that days
later he was still thinking about tilt
brush he even went as far as to say that
it left a fundamentally different
psychological imprint but that didn't
make him want to buy it that made him
want to try it again I still think the
lack of exposure for desktop VR and the
overexposure of mobile VR are relatively
large issues I still think the fact that
the industry is generally calling them
the same damn thing doesn't help matters
either but if my flawed study is to be
believed cost really is the root here
desktop VR isn't dead it just had a bit
of a false start here's hoping they can
turn things around soon Tunnel bear is

watching guys if this video sucked I
completely understand
I don't like saying negative things
about desktop VR either so hit the like
button also if you liked it hit the like
button too because why not
that'll it's I think I'm cheating here a
little bit but that's fine get
subscribed either way if you want to buy
something cool we'll check out Amazon we
talked about a number of things in this
video also in the description down below
we have shirts I don't think you can buy
this one anymore
ah get rekt but you can buy other ones
which would also be cool you can talk
about what I said in this video on the
community forum it's a fantastic site
check that out also watch this video
which is like my review of the oculus
rift and in there I talked about some
comparisons between the vive and yada
yada yada yada
anyways see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
