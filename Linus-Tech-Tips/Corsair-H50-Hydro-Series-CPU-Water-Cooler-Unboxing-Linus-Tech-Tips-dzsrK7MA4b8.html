series cpu cooler so this is the h 50 so
basically what you've got here actually
let's have a look at the picture on the
front you've got a 120 millimeter
radiator with a fan and then a couple of
quarter inch tubes running to a CPU
block and pump all in one sort of unit
now this is meant to be sort of a low
cost liquid cooling solution that's
meant to compete with the high end air
coolers and all the while maintaining
the ease of installation and the the
case compatibility of a high end air
cooler so if we can figure out oh I
think this is actually one of their
power supply boxes now that I look at it
it looks like they've they've redone the
artwork on a power supply box so that's
kind of clever
okay so let's we've got the unit open
here let's get going here so you take
off your first plastic cover take off
yet another plastic cover while I'm
totally not going to remember how this
goes back in okay so here we have it
this is the CPU block and pump unit
itself here so let's get this let's get
this protective packaging off so what
this prevents is it prevents the little
plastic cover which has the thermal
compound from coming off so you can see
here that's where the actual surface of
the CPU block is and then this housing
here actually contains the pump which
circulates the fluid into the radiator
so we can cover that back up here is our
Quick Start Guide so the QuickStart
guide shows you the basics of how to
install the radiator how to install the
retention ring in the backplate and yeah
basically gets you started pretty
quickly so what's next here is that in
other more different languages so we're
not really interested in that okay so
here's our LGA 775 backplate here's our
LGA 775 I think hold down now that might
be 1366 anyway okay it includes 1366 and
a 775 retention ring and backplate and
then I believe this ooh they're going to
be shipping with an 1156 retention ring
and back plate as well so here's the
four screws for installing your radiator
so why don't we actually pull out the
the fan and radiator here for a minute
so you can see there's a nice paper
protective sleeve on the radiator that
prevents these fragile fins from getting
damaged in transit so you want to be
very careful when you're handling the
radiator because you don't want to bend
these if you bend them you may not even
impact performance but what can happen
is you can create more turbulence when
the fans blowing air through and it can
make it a little bit louder so you've
got a nice leaved power connector here
this can actually plug into a fan header
on your motherboard which is really
convenient to see and then here is our
four pin pwm fan so the way corsair
recommends installing it is to actually
put the fan installed backwards in the
back of your case so you're drawing
fresh air from the outside of the case
attach the radiator either this way or
upside down the other way and then you
can run the CPU cooler over to your CPU
and use the backplate for installation
now you use these black screws they go
through the case through the fan and
then right into the threaded holes here
on the radiator so thank you for
checking out my blog video on the
corsair h 50 CPU cooler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
