welcome to my unboxing of something that
we saw for the first time at Computex
this is the fractal design arc mini not
to be confused with the arc mid D arc
mini r2 so this is an M ATX case that is
designed to be extremely compact and
accept a metric what ton of cooling here
and hard drives but not necessarily at
the same time so in terms of the packing
material we've got a hard foam which is
never particularly impressive but I
don't really mind it as much with
smaller cases because they tend to weigh
less and are therefore less likely to
damage the foam in transit due to their
weight although you can see that this
piece barely made it so you can see
there's hey this is why I don't like
hard foam soft foam wouldn't have had
that problem next up we've got the
user's manual which we are going to
promptly throw away because I have a
reviewers guide haha which is just as
good as a user's manual if not better
next up we've got a plastic sheathing
that covers it and in theory keeps it
safe in transit and that got boring so
let's pick up on the actual case so
starting on the outside we have that
typical clean Swedish design that we get
from fractal design which incidentally
happens to be a Sweden based company so
on the front we find two five and a
quarter inch base although the use of
these is incredibly optional as you're
going to find out once we open it up we
have this piece of plastic that holds
this front panel in place as well as the
removable fan filter that is to be
cleaned by running water over it you
know when you clean it anyway so it's
got foam okay anyway there's two 120
millimeter fans of which one of them is
included so that's their silent artoo
series fans and I actually really like
this implementation here with a nice
heavy fan filter it feels very robust
got a nice little fractal design logo
here and then just a simple front that
is very very clean very very simple and
all you got to do is put it a couple
screws to install a fan and you are done
on the top we find the usual suspects in
terms of IO we've got a reset switch a
microphone port a headphone jack a power
switch with a power led as well as two
USB 3.0 ports and an integrated fan
controller five seven and 12 volts are
all supported the right-hand side of the
case is completely plain as we'd expect
from practical design and the left-hand
side of the case
has a nice smoked window that I've
removed the outside layer of plastic off
but not the inside layer at the back of
the case we find another 120 millimeter
fan slot there's actually a total of
seven possible fan slots
I owe and a four plus one arrangement
for i/o I would have preferred to have
that fifth one below it but it would
have made the case that much taller so I
understand why they did this the way
they did you can put things like fans
bee controllers and stuff here you've
got a little padded bottom power supply
mount that also has padding on the
bottom here and then at the top just
like on previous Arc Series cases well I
wouldn't have been funny of that slipped
and fell alright let's go ahead and do
that you've got another removable
cleanable fan filter that comes off the
entire top of the case and this serves a
couple of purposes number one is
functional number two is aesthetic
because they've used an offset
configuration for the top fan holes so
you can see you can mount either a
triple 120 millimeter radiator and yes
it supports a thick triple 120
millimeter radiator because of the way
that it's offset so the motherboard is
actually over here so as long as you
don't have any tall components it can
sit right over top of the motherboard or
it can support a dual 140 millimeter
radiator in the top and it doesn't
really matter because of the gaps here
so you can see that because there's a
lot of space here it doesn't matter what
the spacing of your radiator happens to
be I did miss one thing about the
outside I'm sorry there was another fan
filter down here on the bottom
not my favorite implementation because
it is a longer fan filter but it serves
its purpose you know fairly effectively
so it does allow filtration of both the
power supply intake which is isolated
from the rest of the system's air flow
as well as this bottom 120 millimeter
fan mount that could also be equipped
with a radiator so let's go ahead and
pull the side panel off I like smoked
side panels I think they look good it's
you know your typical fractal design
solid build quality as far as the side
panel is concerned not an excessive
amount of flex by any stretch
I'll just give you guys that give you
guys a little demo of that considering
the fact that most of the side panel is
a window that's what I'd consider to be
acceptable and also has some weight to
it which isn't always the case these
days so inside this is where things
start to get really interesting so I
showed you how that radiator support
worked up there you can do see the way
that the five and a quarter inch pay is
cut out here and the way that it's
screwed in you can do the dual 140 s
without actually removing the five and a
quarter inch bays but if you want to you
know step up to the big leagues and you
want to move up to a three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator you will have
to pull out your five and a quarter inch
base but the good news is that you can
you can also take out your three and a
half inch base so you can see right here
that those front 120 millimeter fans
have easy access to be screwed into
radiators so I can show you guys how the
three and a half inch bays are removed
so you can mount as I said before up to
six three and a half inch drives and
those will go on these sleds right here
which have the usual fractal design
vibration reducing rubber grommets go
ahead and pop that out in fact you can
actually mount these different ways as
well so if you want to get a little bit
more airflow to your graphics card from
that front fan obviously more of air is
going to be able to make it through this
guy this way especially if you don't
have hard drives in there versus this
way or you can pull the whole thing out
entirely and then just have free-flowing
air going straight to your graphics card
if you only need a few fans if you do
want to pull that one out you actually
just flip it over on the bottom I love
construction of cases that is done with
screws versus rivets because it gives
you the flexibility to do what you want
to do with it it is more expensive to
implement this like let's be let's be
real clear every cent counts when it
comes to case manufacturing but I like
it when case manufacturers spend that
extra little bit to give us threaded
holes and screws rather than rivets so
there you go that's what it looks like
oh okay we got to pull out another
couple screws on the back because I
guess they're fractal they wanted it to
be you know Swedish Lee design so you
can see this one has quite a bit less
flex in the window one Swedish designed
and you know very solid and all that
stuff I remember their old cases never
used to have quite that much care given
to the solidity particularly in shipping
I remember the define r2 had a couple of
issues with that hard drive cage it
wasn't reinforced enough and I didn't
realize that when I did my original
video wasn't until I ordered a container
of them at NCIX and some of them started
getting damaged particularly when we
shipped them with a bunch of hard drives
in them in pre-built system so there you
go guys take things very seriously when
I talk about the packaging of products
because I actually do know all right
so there you go there's that there's
that cage oh so that gives us some idea
of just how open the inside can be so
you pull this bad boy out
you put a thick red here thick double
red here thick triple red up here you
can put another single 120 down here you
throw a single 120 in the back they've
actually got adequate spacing here for
radiators that are slightly wider than a
fan and you have a very capable water
cooling extravaganza of a case on a
fairly reasonable budget so I'm
impressed with this now in terms of the
standard case features its M ATX as I
mentioned before there's your four
expansion slots that use the standard
screws thumb screws for those it's got
all black internal cables which is nice
to see and you can also see here there
sorry I want to give you a better view
that you can see here that they come
pre-wired through the included cable
management grommets that Corsair made so
popular with the release of the 800 D
and then on the back we find two more
SSD mounts on the way they've
implemented this is much better than the
way they used to do SSD mounts on the
backup motherboard trays so they are
actually removable using two screws here
here and here
well here here here and here and then
you just mount the SSDs using the
mounting holes here and pull them off
and mount them as you see fit the way it
used to be was they were holes that pass
through the motherboard tray you
actually had to remove your motherboard
in order to mount s his T's on there
cases so that was a little bit
ridiculous there's ample cable
management room in the back of the case
so there's enough for a 24-pin connector
but not a whole lot more I wouldn't
expect to be passing anything over it
and you've got a CPU cutout tray or
cutout in the motherboard tray just the
way that you'd expect on any modern case
