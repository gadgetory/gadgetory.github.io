been pushing the limits of how much
power can be crammed into a small case
and cooled properly with their Trident
lineup now after making some truly small
systems MSI has given us the Trident X a
much larger version but also a darn
powerful one rocking a core I 999
hundred K and an RT X 2080
so let's crack it open and see if the
machine itself holds up to its
impressive spec sheet and today's video
is brought to you by huni huni is a free
web browser extension that will find you
the best promo codes on many shopping
websites like Amazon eBay and more get
it today join honeycomb /l TT it's free
from a distance the tried necks is a
good-looking machine
I appreciate the smaller size although
it is unfortunate that it can't be
placed on its side like previous Trident
models for integration into a home
theater setup after getting closer to
the tried necks though things get a
little less convincing like the front
USB ports and their lettering is in red
but then moving around to the GPU it has
green accents come on you guys how did
you not just swap these stickers for red
ones and moving over to the other side
things get even grimmer now I appreciate
that there is a tempered glass panel
here but how did this gap pass
inspection and behind it isn't even
painted also the CPU airflow cutout is
kind of wobbly and then back over to the
front these two RGB lights don't match
why is this light in the middle so much
brighter than the ones around it and why
is the base such a different color why
does this power button feel so mediocre
and why do I have to point all of these
things out now the tempered glass panel
can be swapped out for a metal one and
this is actually how the tribe necks
comes out of the box so it solves the
Tesla ask panel gap issue and also means
that you won't have to worry about your
side panel getting shattered when you're
going to a lens so the bottom line is
really this honestly the tribe mix is
not a bad looking machine at all
everything that I complained about was a
little icky picky
detail it's just the kind of thing that
the Corsair one would have done right
and I hope that MSI can fix these
problems in the future since none of
them are particularly big ones and
there's a lot of good stuff here so back
to the good stuff specs rocking an
NVIDIA r-tx 2080 core I $9.99 hundred K
32 gigs of RAM this thing is no slouch
and normally this is where I would say
but can they keep it cool in a case this
small the thing is though honestly I'm
not concerned because the design is
really solid first let's take a look at
the graphics card well okay it's just
that it's a full sized desktop graphics
card with a nice beefy cooler and lots
of access to fresh air
this also means that upgrading the GPU
in the future is relatively simple just
take the side panel and top panel off
undo a few more screws which might be
the hardest part since one of ours came
factory chowder's and you're good for
the next gen as for CPU cooling once
again before even testing it there are
no concerns here this heatsink is
massive and breathes in nice fresh air
and the motherboard that's included is
standard actually before we even get to
the performance I should talk about the
insides a little bit more
I do wish that MSI had given the outside
the same kind of attention to detail
that they did here despite cramming so
much Hardware in MSI has still somehow
allowed all of it to be easily accessed
upgraded repaired and with great cable
managing to boot need to upgrade the
storage well there's two two and a half
inch bays right here and the second one
even already has the power cabling done
for you making an upgrade pretty much
trivial need to change out the m-dot to
drive well just open the other side
panel to reveal this easily accessible
and extremely high performance Samsung
Drive the power supply is also a
standard modular affair either in 650
watts in this version or 454 the
twenty-seventh equipped model and
replacing it is entirely possible with
the only real bummer for upgradability
being the RAM which is underneath the
CPU heatsink now this does have the
benefit of providing the RAM with a
little bit of cooling but the real
reason they did this is probably just
that the standard 120 millimeter fan fit
best this way and removing the cooler is
actually still a pretty simple operation
it's just the only blemish that we could
find on an otherwise really
well-thought-out
internal layout so then performance as
expected under a full synthetic load ri9
9900 k8 core processor has no trouble
staying cool with temperatures peaking
at just around 80 degrees fantastic and
it stays well above base clock settling
in around 4.3 gigahertz sustained that's
even better than the corsair one and
that one was liquid cooled the GPU also
doesn't disappoint topping out at 60
and degrees and boosting to a sustained
eighteen seventy-five megahertz and
that's after half an hour of the 3dmark
portroyal benchmark these are really
strong numbers and even more
impressively it does this while
remaining very quiet like okay it isn't
quite Corsair one quiet that thing is
really quiet even under full load though
I was hard pressed to hear the tribe
necks over the HVAC in our office and I
doubt it's gonna be annoying to anyone
even if it's sitting next to you on your
desk like this one is running a
benchmark right now my mic is right here
so all this adds up to then the tribe
necks giving us well the expected
desktop levels of performance you want a
game expect heaps of frames you want to
render a video well don't expect it to
take very long basically you're getting
bombed Hardware in a smaller case and
you don't have to worry about building
it yourself which I guess brings us to
the make or break of any pre-built
computer the price since at the end of
the day hardware is hardware and there's
nothing particularly special about
what's going on in here now our
recommended config comes in at 2500 US
dollars which is a pretty good price
especially when you compare it to the
Corsair one but it's still actually
about $500 more expensive than building
it yourself which also gives you a
little more flexibility and could result
in you ending up with a system that
looks more to your liking so the answer
is as usual if you want to build a
computer yourself yeah you should you
should do that but if you don't want to
build a computer yourself maybe try
anyway it's pretty fun it's not actually
that hard oh no no no this way ha ha ha
ha and then if you're still not
convinced
well we actually really like the MS I
tried next this is a really good option
speaking of great options our sponsor
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction when you call ting you
don't speak to a robot you get put
through directly to a person and for
some reason that kind of customer
service doesn't cost extra
with ting you pay only for what you use
with the
vil coming in at just 23 bucks a month
per device if you're stuck in a contract
and you switch to ting they'll cover 25%
of your cancellation fee up to $75 and
they've got lower mobile data rates than
ever it's $10 per gig beyond the second
gigabyte and one of the ways they want
you guys to save money is to enter their
giveaway since you can win a Samsung
Note 9 and other great ting swag at
start ting calm so go check it out if
you want to lower your phone bill over
at Linus ting calm and by the way if you
go to that second link which will have
down below you will get $25 in ting
credit so thanks for watching guys if
