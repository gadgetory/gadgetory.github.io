this video from CES 2017 learn more
about their rise and processors at the
link in the video description so we
rolled into the Seagate booth where they
were showing off all kinds of stuff
including their 12 big from Lisi which
supports up to a hundred and twenty
terabytes of storage over thunderbolt
free with knock to a fans cooling it man
those guys have good taste then we kind
of went come on you guys show us the
really cool stuff so we rolled into the
big room where they're demoing all kinds
of stuff and I went straight for this
this my friends is the as-yet-unnamed to
my knowledge sixty terabyte SSD it's in
a three-and-a-half inch form factor and
exists sort of as mostly a technology
showcase to show how Seagate has been
investing in the r d-- to address this
many flash dies using some bridge chip
technology that they borrowed from SAS
pretty freakin cool so naturally of
course the first thing i wanted to do
was open it up and have a look inside
where i found that it's actually a dummy
unit I have told Seagate that I intend
to be the first media outlet to preview
this thing once I can get my hands on a
working one but unfortunately this is
not this is not that day so you might
ask yourself what's the anticipated use
case of a 60 terabyte SSD and I actually
got some pretty interesting answers
because it's still by the look of things
not going to be PCI Express based and so
they clearly don't expect it to be
really any faster than what you might
get from existing SATA or SAS technology
and the answer is well look because
there's no flash controller on the
market that has enough data paths to
address each of those NAND dies
individually or even you know a handful
of them at a time this Drive is going to
deal with more latency and less speed
than one of their high performance
drives like say for example this nitro
10 gigabyte per second drive that
reaches a capacity of 8 terabytes at the
moment
that one's going to be a real product
pretty soon no the use case here is
going to be somewhere in between massive
massive arrays of data and high-speed
PCI Express base SSD caches what this
will allow a company like oh say
Facebook for example to do is store
grandma's pictures that haven't been
accessed for over a year on facebook on
a storage medium that is fast enough for
people to be hitting them you know
randomly pulling up a few photos at a
time and high-capacity enough that it's
actually feasible to keep things like
grandma's photos on it so you don't have
to sit around and wait for a page to
load while a hard drive spins up but
Facebook doesn't have to be spending you
know four or five dollars per gig on the
storage that they're using to store it I
heard pricing numbers thrown around of
like fifty thousand dollars a drive but
what I'll say is this if you're the kind
of customer who wants one of these
you're the kind of customer who's not
just ordering one so if you bulk at that
price point then you're probably not the
intended market and pricing could be
highly variable depending on what kind
of NAND flash they're putting in the
drive which would basically be down to
the individual customer so at this point
in the video a fair question might be
Linus do we really need a 60 terabyte
SSD and the answer is while I think they
are planning to productize this this
year maybe not necessarily immediately
but the need is definitely coming so
Seagate projects that in 2019 one
zettabyte of data will be shipped in
that calendar year with 1.3 zettabytes
the following year I mean to put that
number in perspective if we take it back
down to gigabytes that's more gigabytes
than there are grains of sand on the
entire earth and this issue of more
content creation and needing more and
more storage is actually going to get
worse so in that same year in the 2019
2020 time frame they're expecting six
hundred zettabytes of data to be created
to go with that 1.3 zettabytes
of storage that will be shipped so the
answer is yes we do need it and much
sooner than you might probably think so
a huge shout out again to AMD for
sponsoring our coverage of CES 2017
check out the new Vega GPU architecture
which supports a high bandwidth cache at
the link in the video description but
we're going to make that easy for you
it's Vega ve dot G a and also be sure to
check out after the uprising on YouTube
which we're going to have linked in the
top right corner right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
