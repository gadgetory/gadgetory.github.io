when I reached out to Intel about
supporting us with some chips a
low-power Xeon to build the high speed
storage server for our new office that I
first showed off here then a pair of
their top-of-the-line 'if I've $26.99 v3
18 core Xeon processors to build a
network video rendering server also for
the new office well as it turns out they
couldn't send us the low-power chip for
the storage server so we bought our own
but whatever the reason was they were
able to honor our request for the pair
of $4,500 processors so it is with much
things to Intel along with Super Micro
who provided a dual socket motherboard
Kingston who provided 128 gigs of DDR
for ECC Ram and Norco Noctua and FSP who
provided our case cooling and redundant
power that we are able to bring you
these findings because you see the deal
was this send us the chips and we'll
make a video about how we're using them
which sort of puts a lot of pressure on
us to figure out not only if the concept
of network rendering also known as a
render farm works I mean that's been
pretty standard stuff for years
especially in animation but also to find
a way to efficiently use those resources
in our workflow so without further ado
thanks two weeks of work by Edsel and
much patience from the rest of the team
I am pleased to present our new editing
workflow it's fast it has built-in
redundancy for our files and to quote
Dimitri from Hardware canucks who has
already switched to it it brought the
joy back to 4k video editing for me so
here we go
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup check out the link in
the video description to learn more so
the most obvious bottleneck in a video
editors daily life is waiting around for
encoding tasks to complete outputting a
finished ready to upload h.264 video
file can take anywhere from 15 to 30
minutes for us with one pass VBR or even
over an hour with two passes so that was
the first thing we tried to tackle with
the 36 course server machine for
software Telestream episode and Sorenson
squeeze desktop were the frontrunners
initially Telestream was intriguing
thanks to its unique ability to split an
encoding project into pieces process
them across many course and then stitch
them back together at the end regardless
of the codec and Sorenson due to its
excellent handling of multiple
concurrent projects also a time-saver if
you have many processing cores and its
ability to utilize all course for a
single project with supported codecs so
episode is a great concept but we
abandoned it quickly due to stability
issues Sorenson on the other hand
impressed the snot out of us the
software worked their support staff was
professional and even as a trial
customer we were escalated to
engineering whenever we encountered more
complex issues outstanding so next we
tested a variety of different output
formats and found that thanks to
optimizations within Premiere Pro our
projects could be exported very quickly
by our editing work stations in DNxHD to
our server where Sorenson would utilize
all CPU cores to output in h.264 master
copy that was suitable for upload to
YouTube and other video sharing sites in
a fraction of the time that Adobe Media
encoder could do it and all of this
while leaving the video editors
computers free to work on other things
instead of just sitting there barely
usable while they encoded video so
mission accomplished then right well you
know how the rabbit hole
is the discoveries we made about how
dramatically a programs optimizations
around a given codec could affect
performance raised more questions than
they answered and while premier pros
claim to fame is that unlike competitors
like avid and Final Cut it allows any
video file you want to simply be plunked
on to the timeline and edited in real
time it made us consider the way that 4k
footage off our Panasonic gh4 camera
just seemed to chug as you scrub through
it on the timeline even on six CPU cores
and a 10 gigabit network connection
maybe there's some merit then to going
back to the old way so we devised a
workflow that would utilize our copious
amounts of CPU horsepower to transcode
footage from whatever format our various
cameras captured in natively - an
intermediary or mezzanine codec that was
compatible with all the programs in our
workflow so for a number of reasons avid
dnxhd was chosen and would you look at
that comparing prefetch latencies with
native gh4 footage the delay when moving
the playhead in premiere was reduced by
nearly 25 times at 4k depending which
program exactly was used for the
transcode so it was at that point that
the goal actually changed obviously we
could just have the individual video
editors convert all the footage off the
cameras to our mezzanine codec when
they're working but then we'd be right
back where we damn well left off with
highly-skilled video editors staring at
their barely functional computers
waiting for a big queue of videos to
transcode so now we needed a way to
avoid that by using our overpowered
hardware and the answer of course is to
do the transcode at the time of ingest
or when the footage is initially removed
from the camera and here's some bad and
some good news
while squeezed desktop Sorensen's
low-end offering can perform a task like
this across many cpu cores because we
dump so many video clips off our SD card
at a time it just wasn't stable enough
with our workload so we turned to their
server offering which operated much more
smoothly to automatically monitor our
video file dumping folders and transcode
everything we dropped in them so the
benchmark was a folder of 41 video files
totaling sixteen point seven gigs and by
prioritizing multiple tasks this could
be processed in about 14 minutes a small
price to pay even on a video that needed
to be edited immediately for the
improved timeline performance but
unfortunately time wasn't the only price
the server version requires a Windows
server operating system to run on top of
and costs $5,000 plus yearly maintenance
fees and furthermore despite the
assurance we received from Sorensen's
engineers that there shouldn't be any
gamma or color shifts using QuickTime as
a wrapper between squeezes DNxHD export
and premiers import it was there and
very difficult to compensate for so it
was back to the drawing board somewhat
which led us to a conversation with
Blackmagic Design where they said that
Sinha form could also be a great
mezzanine codec an option that had been
dismissed early on due to its limited
compatibility with most software
including Sorenson squeezed although
they had said they could add
compatibility with the next yearly
release so could we quickly transcode
our footage to sinha form it turns out
that yes even with only 30% CPU
utilization effectively ten and a half
of our 36 cores Adobe Media encoder yes
back to that again managed to kick
Sorensen's ass converting to Sena form
versus Sorenson converting to DNxHD and
all of this without a significant loss
in quality regardless of whether we're
working with native 4k footage for
better green-screen and punch in
performance or settling for upsampling
1080p footage for our finished project
by the way please see this video for
more details about the benefits and the
drawbacks of 4k so that's all
and good linus but does sinha form
deliver the answer again yes
while file sizes are significantly
larger especially at 4k then even the
source files timeline performance is
better than even DNxHD thanks to an
extraordinarily poorly documented
feature of sinha form its GPU
accelerated so even though DNxHD also
performs like a champ it can eat 50 to
60 percent of a 12 cores Aeon while
scrubbing through footage while sinha
form is using the fancy titan x graphics
cards that nvidia sent us for our
workstations to keep CPU usage much
lower so then here is the process that
we finally settled on we're using Adobe
prelude 2015 to ingest our footage
automatically dumping the raw files off
of the camera to a local storage array
on the machine in case of an emergency
and then queuing up transcode jobs for
each of those clips in media encoder
2015 to send to our network share we
then use media encoder 2014 which is
included with your Creative Cloud
license by the way to monitor the watch
folders that we export our finished jobs
into and turn those into h.264 files
ready for publishing on websites like
YouTube vessel yuku Billy Billy and
Facebook and while hitting both
instances of media encoder we've seen
CPU usage as high as 90% but that
doesn't mean that you need a
multi-thousand dollar Network render
machine to utilize this workflow all
we've demonstrated here is that it's
scalable to that kind of hardware for a
small team you could easily take
advantage of this on a smaller scale
with a low-power networked machine if
you just wanted to improve your timeline
performance and not sit around waiting
for exports on your main station while
something else works on that in the
background speaking of things that run
in the background
