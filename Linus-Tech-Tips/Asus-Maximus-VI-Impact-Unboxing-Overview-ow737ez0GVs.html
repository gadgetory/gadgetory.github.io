entered in the Intel dynamic ticket
giveaway for a chance to win great
prizes is it Intel Gaming promo comm to
learn more this you guys is the board
that people like me have been waiting
for ever since EVGA released their
nforce 4n ATX sli ready board the whole
concept of high performance fully
featured small motherboards is extremely
exciting to nerds like me who get
excited about small fully featured
motherboards so this is about look I
mean look how look how full to the brim
the accessory package is for the first M
ITX ROG motherboard so here we go let's
get into this because I'm pretty darn
stoked one of the big problems with mini
ITX systems is that you can only have
one expansion slot which means that if
you're a storage enthusiast you're fine
throw a raid card in there if you're a
graphics enthusiast you're fine throw a
graphics card in there if you're an
audio enthusiast you're fine for a great
odd sound card in there but what if you
happen to be enthusiastic about two of
those things now you're boned because
it's only got a single PCI Express 16x
lot even on high-end boards a soos has
addressed that in a very very meaningful
way so we'll start with the accessories
here so first up oh yeah
high-end networking enthusiasts don't
worry you'll be fine wireless AC that is
dual band 2.4 5 gigahertz wireless AC is
built into this board on their M PCIe
combo 2 module so this acts not only as
a wireless AC card but also as an NG F F
or M 2 expansion slot so you can put
upcoming SSDs in there as well so these
two go together just like previous
generation Intel X antennas you can
actually stick this to something that's
made of metal which I go figure don't
have here but anyway you can stick it to
the side of your case or whatever else
as long as it's not made of aluminum
alright next up we've got some SATA
cables so there's
four SATA cables two straight all
straight no right angle SATA cables this
board unlike the IEEE deluxe board only
has four SATA ports compared to six on
the other one because this is more of a
gaming centric board as opposed to a you
know storage or media center centric
build with that said it has a cool media
center feature I'll tell you about later
all right no I'm saving this one for
later
we've got a couple of different screws
for mounting various things to the board
such as the wireless module okay we've
got whatever the devil this is looks
like it whoops and I'm knocking the box
around who knows what he's gonna do next
oh this is way better they should
include this on all of their new boards
instead of the Q connector which I've
always felt as a very cleansin because
it dramatically increases the profile of
the front panel connectors as well as
like just you know not feeling very
sturdy and just being very wobbly this
right here is an expand or is an
extender for it so it plugs in has one
unit just like the Q connector and then
you can actually extend them somewhere
where it's more convenient to plug them
in that's great
Asus if you're watching and I know you
are this on every board get rid of Q
connector love it great idea all right
we've got an i/o shield and then finally
this my friends is where I start to geek
out this is the supreme FX impact this
is a sound card that is also intended to
be used at well as a sound card and can
be used without taking up your PCI
Express slot so remember guys you can
get 5.1 output by reconfiguring jacks so
that's that's a thing but you're going
to be probably mostly using this as kind
of your headphone out and microphone in
I mean what does this board design for
more like land use and if you really
wanted to run a whole bunch of speakers
off of it you're probably going to want
to use an external DAC and the optical
connector right here but this my friends
is what makes it possible to have a
truly
high-end machine from every perspective
that I can think of on an MIT X board so
what they've achieved here is probably
something similar to like Zeus is
telling me this is second only to the
Maximus vi formula in terms of the
supreme FX implementation so you have
there I forget what they call it but
it's a yes sonic radar feature which
allows you to see visually where sounds
are coming from but that's much less
important to me than the fact that
you've got a 115 decibel signal-to-noise
ratio and you've got a lot of the
technologies that we've come to expect
from zonar cards built into something
that comes with your motherboard and so
this is probably equivalent to somewhere
in the range of a thirty five to fifty
dollar dedicated audio solution and it
comes with your board it also is able to
drive up to 600 ohm headphones so that
is very very high impedance headphones
either off of the rear port or even off
of the front port so they have
configured it so that you're not going
to get necessarily a hugely deteriorated
audio experience off your front panel
port like you see with many audio
solutions that might otherwise be very
high-end so extremely exciting they've
also got one other cool media centric
feature that allows you to if you have
it configured correctly have the board
completely powered off as long as it
just has standby power and you can
actually plug something into the line-in
in the front of the case so that would
be a microphone jack is would probably
be coated on on the front and then have
that come out of the line out on the
back of the motherboard so you can
actually run content through the
speakers that are connected to it even
when the board is not powered up so
that's that's kind of neat as long as
they're amped speakers so let's move on
to the actual layout of the board itself
so right here this is impact power
compact dynamo of full scale power these
chokes can handle up to 60 amps of power
so it uses the same black-winged chokes
and 10k black metallic solid state
capacitors that are going to give you
better temperature tolerance cooler
operation much longer lifetime than
generic capacitors and all of this is on
an EM ITX board the first time we saw
this was with the PhD 77 Ida Lux which
was the MIT X board last generation so
this is an even higher end
implementation it
looks better looks better here's the
like huge solid metal connectors that
lead from the general PCB to the thing I
hope you guys can see that those like
massive think of it in terms of like you
know thicker thicker lines for
transmitting power means less loss and
more more stability for the current to
flow so there you go they're taking it
very seriously putting the vrm up here
alright let's move along to the valve
that looks up so good water cool this
but like a nice block they're dead sexy
anyway to ddr3 dual channel slot so you
can run up to 16 gigs with currently
available ddr3 modules the 8 pin and 24
pin connectors are right next to each
other this I've never really seen before
and that really depends on the EM ATX
case you use whether these are optimal
configurations for them but you
shouldn't have too much trouble on board
start as well as on board hopefully this
is reset but it's not actually labeled
so guys let me know if I'm wrong on that
one we've got an onboard USB 3 front
panel header as well as those four SATA
ports I was talking about before the M
PCIe combo 2 actually goes down here at
the bottom of the board as opposed to on
the larger desktop boards we're used to
seeing it up closer to the top you've
got four four pin fan connectors that
are all configurable from within fan
expert 2 so there's one here and then
three actually clustered up here in the
top left corner including their patent
pending one that detects and
automatically configures for three pin
or four pin fan control for your CPU
you've also got an LG 1150 socket I
guess that's important so you can run
the latest Haswell processors including
the 4770k
and then you can overclock the snot out
of it because you're on a very very sort
of desktop grade like Mini ITX board on
the back in terms of i/o we've got that
optical audio port that I talked about
before hdmi and displayport out as well
as their impact control and what the
impact control on the back here does is
it adds more functionality so you can
see it's a little PCB riser that would
normally be on the board itself but
there wasn't enough room so we've got a
post readout which is cool because you
can actually read it from outside the
case as well as the memo
and direct key BIOS flashback and ROG
connect which they no longer include the
cable for but the hardware
implementation is still there so as long
as you have a USB a to a cable you can
get that going no problem for USB 2.0
ports for USB 3.0 ports eSATA is
something we've started to see less of
but there it is it's on this board and
an Intel gigabit NIC supporting their
game first packet prioritization
technology through aces AI suite 2 now
they also include their usual value-add
software with rog board so that is
Kaspersky antivirus daemon tools as well
as their RAM disk software so I think
that pretty much covers it guys would I
recommend the Maximus 6 impact the
answer is yes if you want the very best
possible experience for gaming for an
MIT X build this is pretty much the way
to go they have a new generation I
deluxe if you want more SATA ports then
that one I guess looks pretty compelling
if you want their 4 way optimization
which is their EP you as well as CPU
clock speed the vrm control there's a
but there's a bunch of stuff that it
does to optimize your system for power
as well as performance that is not how
ROG boards overclock with their one
button overclocking whereas the other
one is like it's like dynamic and it
figures it out on its own these use CPU
level up so if you really want that
functionality then go for it otherwise I
really would prefer personally to go
with the ROG board and do it manually
because between this and the NV 6
formula like I can't think of another
board that I would necessarily buy don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos don't forget to like this video
if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave me a comment and let
me know what you think about this board
and I know you're considering not
leaving a comment James but you should
probably do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
