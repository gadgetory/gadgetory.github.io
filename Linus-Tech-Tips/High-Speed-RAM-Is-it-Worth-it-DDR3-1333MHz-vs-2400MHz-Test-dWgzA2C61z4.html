optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more I get asked so often
- what Ram should I get what speed ram
should I get what capacity Ram should I
get so capacity is pretty simple that's
how many things you can have going at
the same time so you look at your
current system how much RAM you have how
much your utilization is how much more
would you like to be able to utilize
there you go if you're not using
professional applications like you know
DaVinci Resolve and After Effects and
Premiere all at the same time you're
probably good with anywhere from 8 to 16
gigs of RAM for quite a while now when
it gets into speed things get quite a
bit more complicated because it's
phenomenally confusing for people who
don't know much about Ram speed there's
frequency which will go anywhere on ddr3
from around 1333 all the way up to 3000
megahertz and then there's Layton sees
which are different ok so frequency
predominantly affects the maximum band
widths so that's how much data can be
transferred to and from it at a time
whereas latency predominantly affects
how quickly it can respond to a request
so these two things can affect
performance in different applications in
different ways however how much they
affect things there you might be
surprised that it really isn't as much
as you might expect so what we decided
to do is we took some high-performance
ddr3 2.4 gigahertz memory so that's 20
400 megahertz memory and we ran it at
800 megahertz ok we run it at 1333 mega
Hertz 1600 megahertz at what I'd
consider to be a typical casa latency 9
2 CL 9 1600 at CL 8 so you tend to pay a
little bit of a premium for a CL 8 kit
versus a 1600 kit 1866 and then for good
measure at 2400 megahertz then what we
did is so we ran two games as well as
Cinebench just to give you some idea how
it runs in games versus synthetics so
here you can see the graph in front of
me which basically goes okay well if
you're looking at the same capacity Ram
running all these different applications
and different speeds you're looking at
not a whole lot of difference in
performer
because what often happens with higher
bandwidth so that is higher frequency
Ram is that it tends to sacrifice
latency and then as you tighten up
Layton sees you tend to sacrifice the
maximum frequency to the point where
they actually cancel each other out a
lot and you end up spending more money
for higher frequency Ram that might look
better on paper but doesn't really
deliver much in terms of a better
performance you know number in the real
world even our ddr3 800 which you can
actually can't really buy we couldn't
even find that even our ddr3 800 isn't
really so much slower that it's going to
make a difference so with that said
let's bring up the next graph which is
the amount the number of dollars you're
paying per FPS we took our gaming
benchmarks and we graphed how much it's
costing you per FPS because the frames
per second didn't really change the
performance didn't change much
suspending more was basically just
spending more and there are reasons why
you might want better memory so for
example if you like the aesthetic of a
particular Ram kit versus another one
that would be a reason to spend more
money on it or if it has like cool
lighting effects on it for example that
might be another reason to spend more
money but beyond that the way that I
personally shop for money for hump for
money yeah I shop for money the way I
personally shop for RAM is I look for a
brand that I trust so it should come
with a lifetime warranty if it's worth
its salt it should be something that you
know you can't find a whole lot of oh
yeah the stall all failed on me or
whatever else because most of the good
brands out there have pretty good
reputations these days there's been a
lot of consolidation a lot of the bad
run companies are just gone
and and that's really what I look for
and you know who has a special edition
round that like Bret matches my other
board really well stuff like that so
there you go guys that is my take on
memory yes there are situations where
more memory bandwidth is needed and you
can't possibly have enough most of these
exist more like in servers not really in
desktop environments leave a like on the
video if you liked it leave a dislike if
you disliked it and leave a comment if
the results were not something you were
expecting to see and as always don't
