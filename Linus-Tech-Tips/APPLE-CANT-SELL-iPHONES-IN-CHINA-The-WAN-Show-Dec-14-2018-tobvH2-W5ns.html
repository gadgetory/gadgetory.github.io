supposed to know this is literally quite
literally your department hey that's
kind of true but it wasn't supposed to
be supposed to be tournament we're live
on Twitch live on Twitch are we live on
you too oh wow oh my god we're live on
YouTube are we live on Flo plane hey
whoa okay it's not playing but that's
you know what yeah oh that's reassuring
Wow we are live on three platforms at
once how many Terms of Service are we
breaking right now one what are Flo
please just you know what I know we're
already half an hour late but darn it
and we're gonna cut this and we're gonna
do better we're gonna cut it yeah we're
gonna come back we're gonna break more
Terms of Service oh let's get a mixer
account actually that wouldn't mixer
lets you stream another still be only
one guys welcome to the LAN show for the
time simulcasting to flow plain YouTube
and twitch TV we have never done this
before pretty unreal floatplane just got
live streaming support it's sort of so
it's actually had live streaming
capabilities for a long time but now it
has a chat look at how ception is this
okay
so they got me in the corner like people
watching on YouTube they've got youtuber
Linus in the corner over here and then
there's like whatever there's the corner
of me and the corner of the floatplane
they're like they're like watching
through you could see the delay look at
that baby yeah anyway so it's got I
think what about like seven seven second
delay or is it's for most people I
expect it will be around ten seconds
plus or minus two but I do like I don't
know it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
any
anyway so huh do you want do you want to
tell us how much fun this was to get
going it actually wasn't even that bad
really we've had we've had the last room
apart working for a while take some wine
the kid that was not that was not full
plates problem that was not full Plains
problem you're just gonna pin it right
on Jake aren't ya
no it's it's so rtmp servers as far as
we can tell yeah don't like what is it
hold on wait stop hold that thought
look at this the video quality is great
I was just gonna share that with the
YouTube people who are enjoying YouTube
live streaming quality I enjoy that you
two people just dictate we love you
YouTube people mate mates over on
YouTube right now wait what are you
doing watching on YouTube bro wow wow
wow wow way to not support Luke yeah so
the guy that fixed it AJ thank you
actively playing beer pong because it's
like definitely after work just uh in
all capital letters and it's a good
thing I'm great at this game
super alright alright so we got a great
show for you guys today I think I don't
know I haven't actually looked at the
notes um Windows 10 if you check for
updates it's been downloading preview
patches oops what else we got here leaks
send the launch of the Galaxy S 10 not
to be confused with the galaxy s 9 my
friends this will be totally different
and two incredible things happen in
China iPhone sales were completely
halted and they banned fortnight and pub
G China you know why you got to be no
fun how are we supposed to play pop G on
our iPhones now let's roll the intro
anywhere without a kappa okay maybe
maybe I beat back but who's Manning the
floatplane oh that must be Nick probably
yeah that's not a mystery Nick all right
so why don't we jump right into our
first topic today Windows 10 you know
this has always driven me nuts have you
ever been driven nuts by clicking check
for updates in Windows and it being like
your computer's up-to-date and then
quite literally three minutes later
you'll get like a thing
downloading up wins yeah and it's like a
service pack and you're kind of sitting
there going I do not see that what
exactly is the purpose I wish I could
swear right now we don't really swear on
this show but no what is the purpose of
this button if it doesn't check for
updates well now they made it work too
good so according to Microsoft Windows
10 has B C and D updates and each is
released once per month these quality
updates are smaller than feature updates
like the October 2018 update that came
with all kinds of great features so it
was wonderful which are meant to be
released once every six months usually
in the spring and fall anyway it doesn't
matter so B is the biggest and comes out
on Patch Tuesday the second Tuesday of
the month these are the most important
updates featuring new security fixes and
they contain previously released
security fixes from prior B updates and
previously released bug fixes from prior
C and D updates Windows Update doesn't
automatically install C and D updates on
most pcs however it does when you check
for updates maybe
according to a recent Microsoft blog
post this makes you a seeker so just
because you're like hey I should have my
computer
I was pretty good I was pretty pale I
okay in the most recent which I think is
still only on flow plane the ass recent
PC manufacturers investigation video
that Joe Klein and then they put in the
credits for the joke what was the joke
line I don't even remember this I don't
remember what you said I said something
super punny okay super aggressively
punny and they like pause the whole
video and ran credits as if it was over
and it was like for joke writer Linus
like joke delivery Linus all this kind
of stuff and then like joke support Ivan
or something it was it was wonderful I
really enjoyed them I can say without
beyond a shadow of a doubt that must
have been edited by Pella that is a plus
1,000%
also I love it I enjoyed it a lot
anyways back back on topic the seeker
thing so literally just wanting your
computer to be up to date and like
secured and more stable which is
generally what you would hope that means
you get labeled as a seeker which is
basically a beta testing program like
what No so wait a beta testing Beta Beta
testing program for B updates
taking place on stable pcs they have
repeatedly said only advanced users
should click the check for updates
button accept what everyone has trained
everyone to do forever is like when
you're doing maintenance you just click
the check for updates so what if I click
this on like one of the servers because
I'm performing server maintenance on the
weekend and I want updates because it's
time to reboot them no no now I'm an
advanced using yes well you are but like
so you shouldn't be automatically oh
this is fun so this could explain why
Microsoft generated so much hate within
the tech community specifically like
like there it seemed like there was a
disproportional response to the whole
deleting files thing because normally
that kind of thing can happen but it'll
be among users who will like complain to
their sister over dinner that like
stupid laptop my files are going but it
was like enthusiasts shrieking about it
so apparently the people who had their
files deleted
by the faulty October update were users
who click the check for updates button
that's insane
it's actually insane Wow so that could
have easily happened to me because I was
like oh yeah you know I I haven't really
installed any updates bla bla bla
lately but I do click that button when
I'm ready to install an update you know
it's interesting fascinating I noticed I
haven't talked about this on web show I
guess I don't think so but I'm running
mint right now yes not on show ok yeah I
did know this so I'm running mint right
now
I was running these Linux by the way
yeah for the uninitiated yeah I was
running 8.1 embedded systems I loved
heard it's mint I loved it but embedded
systems it's not automatically
downloading updates
I had it flag to not automatically
download updates what made it so I had
to switch to mint was I ran Windows
updates and then my computer restarted
black screen nothing worked I could see
my mouse but couldn't do anything
anything at all try to recover the OS
nothing not gonna work set it error in
every single time Bad Bad News Bears
I switched to mint to recover it oh I
did mint live CD to recover my stuff
that worked I got all my files sounds
good installed windows again did updates
again black screen again ok did mint
more permanently this time maybe it's
cuz I checked updates this is talking
Windows 10 specifically but I did notice
when I checked the like optional updates
thing yeah I looked at it there was
preview Oh interest I didn't put that
together until literally right now the
crazy thing about this is they have the
insider program yeah like they actually
have a welcome I think well communicated
formal program for this floatplane
stream quality seems to be all over the
place in case you were just curious so
some users are getting literally like 23
someone wrote they're getting 23
megabits a second down which is pretty
dumb for a live stream if your
connection can take it yeah then enjoy
but others are saying they have they
have good connections and it's like
looking pretty Pinner and mine in fact
is
not is looking a little soft right now
so it was looking a really sharp before
I think AJ's in the chat he's he's
hanging out some people really get that
look look look okay you click the check
for updates button when you join flow
plane that's basically a big check for
updates button this it's its beta its
beta its alpha its alpha its very alpha
it's very weird that people are getting
like monstrous mega bit down but it's
it's it's a mixture of things that right
now there's no manual quality settings
so there's a mixture of things that
determine what quality you're getting
including mine just sharpened definitely
bleeding viewport size and a few other
things as well oh really okay
interesting someone just said they
peaked at 32 megabits a second that is
ridiculous I have no idea what's doing
that but AJ's AJ's here yeah AJ is the
hero full hero mode anyway I haven't
experienced that before on any of the
test either what are you getting yeah
I'm way I'm lander I'm like way way less
than that like I'm receiving anywhere as
low as like two 6-4 yeah it's a little
better now
anyway why don't we move on to our next
next news topic for the day leaks and
launch the Galaxy S 10 is coming and I
am having a real hard time getting
interested in another phone right now
yeah cuz they're all really boring well
I just had a whole slew of them not just
boring gal Samsung was sort of my last
hope for someone to not jump on this
like weird cutouts and holes in the
display bandwagon like I don't know
about you but when I first got a webcam
so this was quite a long time ago when I
first got a webcam the mounting system
for the particular one that I bought was
not very good and what happened was it
kind of hung down a little bit in front
of my screen giving me well effectively
a knotch
I thought it was stupid then
I think it's stupid now now I have seen
some relatively tasteful applications of
the knotch have you seen the oneplus 60
yeah and the like little swoop I think
it's a lot better yeah but I am NOT a
fan of the infinity Oh display that is
rumored to be coming in the s10 I can't
I can't River who said this but some
who'd someone wants to get you know we
we nicknamed the thingy a notch I don't
know who said this but they said this
should be called the pimple and I think
that's kind of cool here oh yeah that
doesn't look good at all especially the
s10 plus like what the heck so I can get
it there's two things there but like
even if they made it like yeah I don't
know it's just weird and useless and I
don't like it like they could have just
made the chin bar smaller again and just
just I don't know I just know yours
might not be a very popular opinion but
you actually spent some time with a
pixel three XL and you had your own
experience with a pretty ridiculous
knotch
I didn't really mind it please do
elaborate that's honestly pretty much it
I didn't really care it pretty much
never bought oh why do you care because
it doesn't have to be that way what's
wrong with the note 9 Samsung already
nailed it they already nailed it it's
fine it's fine exactly I don't think
it's a good thing I'm not saying it's a
positive thing I don't wish it was on
all my devices
it just doesn't really bother me if they
have to go that low and honestly pixel
devices while I have enjoyed them very
much because I really like stock Android
I've never really been other than their
camera I've never really been like the
bleeding edge of what can happen with a
phone fair enough you know what I mean
software wise sure hardware wise yeah no
the bleeding edge is this my phone
including a selfie remote
that that is the bleeding edge that is
literally the only thing I use this
pencil that's pretty funny actually also
that one tweet that I sent where I put a
bunch of question marks on it all right
well why don't we walk through what's
what's shakin with these phones here I
mean there's some cool stuff so there's
gonna be three versions the s10 the s10
light and the s10 plus so the 10 and the
10 plus are rumored to be curved
they are wait is this even like rumored
is this consider yeah these are these
are maybe leaks I don't know whatever it
doesn't matter
sure let's call them rumors so the s10
is gonna have 128 or 512 gigs of storage
that is a lot of phone storage making in
my opinion microSD expansion slot
basically irrelevant so if we can move
past needing to put SIM cards in our
phones like a bunch of chimps from you
know 1998 at some point then we can do
away with a tray that slides out of our
phones increasing their water resistance
it's gonna be $7.99 or $9.99 this is in
pounds so I don't know how that
translates usually the Europeans just
kind of get fleeced on that conversion
so it'll probably be equivalent in US
dollars even though the pound last time
I checked I paid attention to the whole
like brexit thing going on and what
that's done to the currency but last I
checked it was worth more than the USD
the s10 plus is going to be 0.3 inches
bigger and we'll have a one terabyte
version along with 128 replacing these
along with the 128 and 512 and go for as
much as 13 99 pounds and then the s10
light will have a non curved display 128
gigs in it'll be cheaper at 669 so still
pretty pricey but by the time you buy it
on a 2 or 3 year contract or whatever
your carriers offer you can have it
pretty darn subsidized you could
probably get it for like a couple
hundred bucks they are supposed to
include headphone jacks an in screen
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner no iris
scanner anymore they're doing away with
that the iris scanner it was cool but
it's like it's obviously a stepping
stone like that wasn't gonna be the way
forward unless they could figure out how
to make a super fisheye lens on the
on the front of the phone high
resolution enough to read your iris from
anywhere and that's I don't know maybe
someday but it's not realistic right now
yeah the ability to wirelessly charge
other devices is something they're
calling power share okay have you seen
this have you seen this how they want to
do this no it's like put up your phone
we're sharing power now friend I'm not
even kidding what is the point of that
you see this is literally the thing in
my life that most often needs to be
topped up why exactly do it so you have
to like NFC photo share power now it's
the greatest feature I've ever okay to
be fair yeah didn't add to the cost
which like it's gonna add to the cost
but if it didn't add to the cost the
ability to like kind of jumpstart
someone sure kind of cool sure I guess I
would probably have a battery bank on me
sure but sure yeah but it's good add to
the cost so like whatever I don't know
um you know it's really interesting my I
have not run out of phone battery ever
since I got a car with Android auto
because there's such a good reason to
plug in my phone when I'm driving and
with not not even fast charged I don't
even use fast charge I think it's like a
two amp charger something like nothing
special but even with that with how
quickly phones charge these days it's
like kind of amazing actually because if
I'm at you know 20% or whatever and I
just drive somewhere for ten minutes
it'll be at thirty five forty and boom
I'm good for like a significant amount
of the rest good little pop ups and it's
nice because that can actually extend
the overall life of your of your phone
as well I'm saying that to the stream so
random little flow point update while
you do that we're out over 350 people
live right now really the average viewer
is getting 4.4 megabit per second the
reason why people are seeing like some
low end stuff is because they're getting
bursts god gotcha
yeah and actually four point four isn't
that low for a stream for the average
viewer got it
alright so most people don't watch it
source we do need to have manual
selections though so that people can
choose to be higher that would be
I'll be good when you're gonna get hired
she'd be a choice all right
I thought I'm tired like because this
week was tiring or yeah it has been it
has been a tiring week I like I've
hardly even seen this guy we're like
kind of back to that thing where like
the entire week went by and I didn't
even see you yeah
what is exciting in Luke land in Luke
land like the place where Luke lives my
snowboard showed up nice yeah that's
cool we gotta go snowboarding yep
definitely mine super old like when I
was a teenager was I even a teenager yet
I think I got it before I moved in with
my mom so I was I didn't get much taller
I was just gonna say I still actually
have my snowboard I was around then too
and it just doesn't work for me anymore
the boots don't fit it's not tall enough
you keep it just in case I need
something necessarily talk about some of
the stuff I guess I can't say floatplane
things yeah because because the rest of
its like my grandpa stuff I just told
the floatplane stuff is uh no that's
still I guess I can talk about the
problems sure okay so I'm trying to get
a place I'm living in Basin Street for a
long time I've been trying to buy an
accommodation of my own
pretty nice basement suite yes yes but
it's it's an accommodation of my own so
right oh it's going down all right
that's not great anyways and my problem
right now is Shaw is the only isp
available at the place that I want to go
to you and Shaw's maximum commercial up
or residential upload if I remember
correctly
he's like 15 or 20 megabit per second up
and I don't want to deal with that
because I want a stream and stuff
Shaw has shown time and time again that
they're not interested over the last
many years they're not interested in
increasing that has to do with their
infrastructure being more TV based in
whatever whatever so like it will never
go up they just doubled their download
speed for everyone almost everyone but
the upload didn't go up at all yeah so
you can get a connection that I think is
what six hundred megabits down and like
ten up I'm pretty sure it's six hundred
down 15 up 15 up oh oh sorry 15 you know
it's funny because I have been on our
commercial connection here so give it up
gigabit down for so long like it has
been so we got fiber at the old office
that would have been we've been in this
building for three plus years now so
that would have been like four and a
half years ago and that fiber was 151
feet 150 150 so it had been almost half
a decade since I had uploaded a video to
YouTube from a cable modem okay so
before I got fiber at my house I have
three hundred three hundred fiber at my
house anyway before I got the fiber in
at my house for some reason I had to
like transcode a wine show or something
like the stream broke in the middle or
something I had to choose I had to
splice it together and then upload it
and I took it home to do it and I
clicked upload and then I like sat there
and I expected to just sit at my
computer and finish babysitting it and
making sure that it went live and then I
checked the the timer for it and it was
like yeah come back in two and a half
hours like what it's like you go back
quite a few years in terms of Internet
and I was on there three hundred down
connection which is now the 600 down so
I must have been 15 megabit up cuz that
50 mega that's one and a half megabytes
a second so to upload 90 megabytes is a
minute so nine hundred megabytes would
be
ten minutes so then something like the
wine show which is now I think a six and
a half or eight gigabyte file or
something stupid like that okay fine
maybe it wasn't two hours maybe was a
hard 1/2 doesn't matter the point is
that sucks it's bad and then you're
gonna have some fluctuations and that
and Shaw is somewhat shared in terms of
their performance so if you were trying
to do that in a high time primetime
gonna be slower so anyways I'm not down
I'm not down at all with Shaw connection
I might know especially if that's the
only option uh uh not gonna do it and
apparently Shaw in this building was
like oh we're gonna give five years free
Internet 30 and basic cable so tell us
was like I use were just not I'm not
gonna go in there no potential customers
so I'm trying to talk to tell us right
now be like hey there's some potential
customers like these connections do
whatever just come on would you do it
sure would you hold on a minute cuz like
my internet goes over 100 bucks a month
yeah okay so the reason why I said sure
right away
yes I've literally thought about this
scenario already okay okay so you would
pay like two hundred and fifty bucks a
month it'll be a little it'll be less
than that but it's it's still about two
hundred bucks a month okay you would pay
two hundred bucks a month if they were
like you know you need and find six
people okay and you could only find five
you'd buy two to get a fiber into the
building yes because would you buy three
that were probably getting to a no at
that point because what I'm doing you
have nine hundred megabits it you could
get like almost because Isaac you know
but you could do so remember that video
we did okay sorry I know I interrupted
hold that phone oh this is this is cool
this is crazy because we're getting the
10 gig connection here you remember that
video we did when I tells bonding
service you could bond your connection
through a VPN to the office you could
bond the connections you're so close
physically this way that the latency hit
wouldn't be that bad you'd eat like
three milliseconds probably oh my god
that would be hilarious would you pay
if you could bond the connections for
free because I wouldn't charge you to
put something serve room I don't care
that'd be hilarious about it what do I
care you wouldn't even be using it half
the time if that was okay if it was just
like for funsies no but if it was like
to get tell us into the building
yeah sure you'd do it yeah all right
interesting
mainly because that contract would have
a time gate on it and I would be able to
not that's at some point yeah because
okay my issue is right now that place is
actually a really good deal yeah so that
increased monthly would still
technically make that place worth it
sure God makes sense that's the
reasoning behind it
guy got it if I had to get the other
place I'm looking at I would not do that
regardless got it got it got it
ah I'm having fun I'm having fun but all
good things must come to a pause not an
end the show is not opens they're still
good things
let's tell you guys about Maus backpacks
this is the new one is it yeah this is
the previous one this was my briefing
and then this this is the slightly even
more older version of this one but this
is the one that I actually daily drives
so that makes it easier I guess no
that's the Oh this is the old grande
wait is this bigger than mine is that do
you have a grande I don't know no I
don't know if you do I don't have a
grande I have a smaller one okay shut up
anyways this is updated December 2018
this is the new Grande okay it's the
previous condom put that one away
apparently it was so we can compare
differences but like no we aren't gonna
do that okay you can't buy the old one
anymore anyway so there's a pocket fact
there's a pocket there
I use this pocket for my screwdriver and
I use this pocket for when I
accidentally forget to take my
microphone and my teleprompter out of my
pocket at the end of the day and I put
it here so everyone knows all the
shooters know if - - I can't find it
check there it's a fantastic pocket to
have like dedicated to that one thing I
want to point out I point this out every
single time but its case you haven't
seen the show before the orange the
orange is amazing the orange makes it so
that you like shiny reflective bright
orange you can easily see into the
bottom of here I put my if I put my
wallet in there you can easily see that
the wallet is there yeah your old of
urkki bag was orange on the inside and
that's like that's that's it's really
helpful with finding speaking of key I
keep my USB keys in this zippered pocket
in mine
Oh me except I don't have these ones I
don't think so that's cool I guess I
keep a mouse in here but this one has
the power feature so you can plug in
which is actually what do you want John
Oh more third well you know what Moss is
cool they don't care okay you can say
25% using offer code Linus tech 25 which
is the same as the percentage that
you're saving this other sides for but
it's kind of like plasticy so maybe it's
supposed to be for a water bottle in
case you get a little leak I think so
and then finally you've got boom a
built-in battery bank slash charger
doodad with type C and type A ports and
mine has all this stuff but frankly I
ripped it out because I don't really
charge stuff in my bag but you can do
that sir some people love that function
oh yeah I just I don't really care it's
fine so you can use offer code lines
tech 25 atmoss organizer calm until
Christmas oh it's 25 because it's 25%
off and Christmas is December 25th Oh
so get this get this sorry I'm gonna
move our sponsor stuff away cuz this is
gonna get a little bit political oh okay
apparently there's a school in Vancouver
that is banning candy canes because the
red symbol and the J symbolize the blood
of Jesus okay so I don't normally like
get real is that even bad when you when
you go to church don't you like well the
point is that it's upsetting to people
who don't go to church not people who do
oh yeah no no yes that's sort of like
one of the fundamental you know blood of
the Christ and the flesh of the all of
that all of that kind of so other people
can't so other people are mad
because candy canes are in the SKU and
if anyone who's involved in this
decision is watching I think you're an
idiot I just want to throw that out
there there's nothing wrong with wearing
turbans there's nothing wrong with
eating candy canes yep because it
doesn't matter if you disagree you're
actually stupid all right
why don't you move on to our next book
so this is something we can all agree on
savage jerky is delicious it is I'm
gonna have some teriyaki you want
actually you know what I'm gonna go with
some habanero buffalo sauce on I don't
see that either that's been opened so
someone got into it Colton was probably
like what is this probably cold or Jonah
savage jerky is made with high-quality
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with the goal of creating
a snack that's full of flavor and spice
but that isn't bad for you they've got
13 different flavors of jerky all right
this is a hot one it's pretty hot like
they're sriracha bacon and maple buffalo
bacon that's my favorite they make
barbecue sauces hot sauces and the spice
rub and their Carolina Reaper hot sauces
is one of the hottest peppers in the
world the Carolina Reaper you can use
offer go to ltte to save 10% at Savage
jerky boom that one's good
actually it's not that hot I like it
it's just hot yeah that's actually a
really good overdo it if you like if you
like spice but no I feel like to taste
things yeah I think it's at a really
good spot for that that's really because
it's really you've got the heat but like
it's fine I don't think I've tried this
one before I definitely have it hmm
buffalo sauce anything with buffalo
sauce have you ever tasted anything with
buffalo sauce on it that's not good
actually yes unfortunately what was it
it was a rack of ribs
you had Buffalo ribs that sucked
yeah not in our house no no no those
were wonderful they were Buffalo but
they were good wherever they were they
were fantastic I just yeah no that was
not there
a completely different thing Wow who
decided wasn't these either good I saw
that one coming yeah I know well no
these are clearly not ribs I think I
don't think anyone just making sure I
don't think any people wanted to ban
candy canes proper oh lordy okay private
Internet access private access supports
a variety of VPN protocols and types of
encryption and authentication allowing
you to dial in the exact level privacy
protection that you need
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome what
more do you want and you can connect up
to five devices at the same time on a
single account so I don't know if this
is against their Terms of Service but
like when my in-laws went to China I was
like yo use my account
bippity Boppity sign in on both their
phones and drop them off at the airport
cool beautiful yeah done didn't work the
whole time while they were over there
China's constantly in like this sort of
arms race with VPN providers but they
were able to actually like check their
email periodically which is better than
nothing
yeah their apps include DNS leak
protection and ipv6 leak protection they
have an internet kill switch that will
block all traffic if the VPN becomes
disconnected and you can check it out
today at LM GGG /p i a when or also like
this thing which is even worse yeah yeah
we should we really still like it's
possible he even set up the shortener
now we should just shortener that
ourselves we should well it's just the
graphic that's been okay all right
iPhone sales speaking of China halted in
China a Chinese Court this is originally
posted by diehard on the forum and the
original article is from Reuters
a Chinese cry I thought that was Reuters
until like two years ago
I had never heard anyone say Reuters
it's Reiter's
you said Reuters I thought that was
literally a different website that I
hadn't necessarily seen nope okay no I
just only seen it in text like I'd read
any of it but I never I've heard it but
I thought it was just a different
website I don't really listen to video
and I don't have a cable subscription so
I don't watch like TV news I have to
explain people all the time that I
don't want shows very often like I'm
usually gonna do something instead and
that's apparently super weird but all
right well even me I'll like make like a
family guy references something from
like back in the first few season when
it was really good and like everyone was
watching it I don't know if it was that
good it seemed good at the time let's
just it was pretty big then it was it
was big at least big yeah and I'm like
and you're like I don't know
so I take so much flak for talking like
a valley girl do you even notice what
okay on our on our typical videos okay
where it's sort of mostly our
subscribers watching there's nothing
there's nothing about the earrings
there's nothing about he's probably gay
there's nothing about valley girl speak
but when our videos get picked up by the
algorithm and they start to spread yeah
yeah a great example was the the
stealing tampons on go from the Amazon
go story so it was hilarious because all
of a sudden it was like going back ten
years and I'm like yeah - when I first
started uploading videos and the
comments section was super predictable
he said his voice is annoying yeah um my
hair wasn't as bad Ben so there weren't
as many comments about that it's worse
now and anyway so there was there was
one that recently that kind of managed
to go outside our usual sphere of
viewers that watch it and it was the
Walmart gaming PC and I had wanted to
ask do you even notice
not even remotely huh I have never
thought that at any point in time and I
brought it up because just before I
brought it up the reason that I thought
of it was I said like probably at least
every third word over a span of about 15
words myself doing it I was like huh I
know I've never
but you got to also consider like our
age group said like a lot we did it was
like a thing that wasn't jut Jesus
Christ that wasn't just a sorry it
wasn't just a valley girl level thing
that was a like a popular thing to do at
that point in time regardless of being
valley girl or not someone said you
don't seem valley girl but you do seem
Western Canada I'm like well yeah yeah
for sure I was like Paul yeah maybe the
problem is I do too okay remember when I
used to edit your videos yes and you
would comment like sorry you have to
listen to my voice so I was like I don't
get it I don't care yeah like I never
I've never noticed any of that yeah I
don't even think your voice is
particularly high but apparently I'm
just objectively wrong about that so
like it's pretty bad I don't know you
know I experimented for a while hosting
videos and this slightly lower register
so it came from one that I hosted when I
was sick yeah yeah and what I did was I
experimented with delivering a little
bit more like this like Italy I don't
like it a bit more bass
I don't like and a lot of people noticed
and some of them said wow this is an
amazing improvement all of a sudden I
can actually listen to these videos but
the majority of the people who commented
on it we're actually upset they're like
no I like you I like to my outline is
like what it's it's it feels very
disingenuous to me it people said it
felt really sterile yeah more like I was
a presenter reading the script that had
been provided to me as though I didn't
fully understand it you sound almost
radio yeah maybe maybe a little bit more
I mean I still don't think I have a
radio voice but you know face maybe boys
know ah let's move on we wanted to talk
about the whole like Chinese thing right
iPhone sales halted so a Chinese Court
has ordered a sales ban
of select iPhone models in China for
violating two patents of the chip maker
Qualcomm Inc though intellectual
property lawyer said enforcement of the
band was still likely a distant threat
the case is part of a global patent
dispute between Apple and Qualcomm that
includes dozens of lawsuits Apple said
it's filed a request for reconsideration
with the court the first step in a long
appeal process the fugu Intermediate
People's Court found Apple infringed to
Qualcomm patents and ordered an
immediate ban on sales of iPhone models
from the 6s through to the 10 China Hong
Kong and Taiwan or Apple's third largest
market accounting for about one-fifth of
their total 265 and a half I'm sorry
billion in sales in the most recent
fiscal year so there's a little bit of
commentary here that this could be a
political play because Apple is a direct
competitor to some of the biggest
companies in China whereas Qualcomm as a
supplier so you can see them siding with
them there but I mean frankly I wouldn't
be surprised if this just ends up being
kind of an attempt to waste time more
than anything else like I don't really
understand the purpose of this kind of
thing yeah - already it's from the 6s 3
to the 10 the appeal process will take I
mean I don't know if the Chinese courts
are as slow as the ones over here but I
suspect they probably are very long I
don't know then again I did watch the
Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies man
but pretty efficient to me but you never
you never know so if they take anywhere
near as long as it is here by the time
Apple were ever to have to actually pay
anything or a sales ban were to actually
go in effect those models would probably
be eol and therefore completely
irrelevant so I mean we saw a really
similar thing happened with some of the
early galaxy models where by the time
Apple managed to force Samsung to stop
selling them in North America they were
outdated and replaced by newer ones
anyway I mean that's the that's sort of
it's just one of the ways in which the
patent system has failed us
due to the pace of modern technology
there are many ways if you didn't
understand that illusion because you
don't like Kenny Gaines
I don't even like candy canes I mean I'm
not even defending candy canes till I
like them I think they're stupid and
they're not very good and when I first
heard that candy canes were being banned
in the school I actually agreed I was
like oh it's probably a danger thing
like between either sharpening up the
one end and like stabbing someone with
it or taking the you end putting it in a
fist and like really messing someone up
because that could be done you know you
punched some soft tissue with that like
even if it didn't stay completely sharp
you could definitely do some damage I
was like oh yeah that makes sense and
then I was I was talking about wife
about it and she's like no no it's
because it's like a religious symbol I'm
just saying I never even put that
together well pretty much everything
Christmas I know but like the J and the
like whoa that may not even what do you
what it is but that just might be why
people are mad about it
sure okay why no no what I'm gonna
Google this Oh someone on floatplane
chat just asked where do I buy that
shirt I know I've been wearing this
shirt for literally months know where to
buy it no we have a huge shipment you've
seen Nick's office right yes it's full
of boxes and boxes and boxes of these
shirts we're gonna have a new store it's
gonna be on LT t store com we've been
hard at work on this for a very very
long time it has taken too long but
that's a whole other conversation but
pretty much what happened was we weren't
happy with either the speed of delivery
or the quality of the printing or the
service or whatever else from any of the
merch providers that we've dealt with
for one reason or another we have ended
up switching every time and so we
finally went you know what this is gonna
be a lot of work and it has been a lot
of work but we're just going to find a
way to do merch fulfillment ourselves so
over on LT t store calm right now you
can pre-order the scam USB Drive which
is actually 32 gigs
it's from Kingston but says
terabyte on it because we're funny so we
lose it to this in one of our recent
videos this is just kind of like a
collector's item so you can you can get
one if you want or you can not get one
if you don't want it's a pre-order just
please note but it's like it's a
Kingston USB Drive you know exactly what
you're getting
apparently someone in chat oh really all
right and very soon and Nick is standing
there presumably with an update you will
be able to buy this shirt that's not why
you're here
shirts TVD what what is not DVD are they
up oh yeah so also coming is cable ties
do you want to bring that kit there's a
cable tie here okay
so we're gonna have packs of 10 they're
packs of 20 sorry they're LTT you can't
see these at all I'm sorry whatever you
still can't see them this alt T on the
end Adams gonna bring them to the camera
really super autofocus yeah honestly
honestly they're nothing super amazing
they're just nice cable ties they look
clean so you guys know it's it's a white
box with LTT in it never was oh is it
orange printing like like the yeah okay
so oh okay we don't have many of those
oh are they like supposed to be limited
edition or we just didn't think they'd
sell as well alright apparently we
played it safe on the orange ones who
would want you know orange ones actually
I think I think I was in on that
decision okay yes so if I don't like
them I have only myself to blame and
Nick and Lloyd what can I do for you
okay yeah yeah yeah we're like in the
middle wind chill yeah we started super
late we're streaming on floatplane oh
yeah
Oh China bands fortnight and pub G a
panel of sensors set up to vet mobile
video games in China
has assessed the first 20 titles that it
did refusing nine of my permission to go
on sale including fortnight and pub Jean
developers of the other 11 have been
told that they need to make adjustments
to remove controversial content everyone
was either banned or had go back to your
game ANDed the alert E's have voiced
concerns about the violent nature of
some titles as well as expressed worries
about the activity being addictive so in
fairness to China should fortnight be
banned
no the so President Xi Jinping has also
called our kids more to be done to
tackle a rise in nearsightedness among
the young something that the children
trees Ministry of Education has linked
to children playing video games at the
cost of spending time on outdoor
pastimes okay parent your kids and what
does the Chinese government mean exactly
by in harmonious chatroom they wouldn't
like twitch is twitch no twitch isn't
over there right the chemical no yeah I
mean anything with live chat it's pretty
tough over there and it's got to be
pretty banned
yeah pretty censored and stuff like
Excel spreadsheet oh yeah surprise okay
it looks there's an edit on reddit that
says it has been brought to the original
posters attention that Blizzard posted
an announcement on their official Weibo
denying that they've received notice for
action needed on their games but that
has since been deleted the Chinese
community has been somewhat divided with
some accepting this list as believable
and others saying it's probably fake
since anyone could make it yeah it's
it's just like you were saying it's not
even it's just it's just a table
actually be really bad for blizzard in a
lot of ways because it's set in there
Diablo was because of like in harmonious
chat no no it was game missions include
fraud fascinating immortal was like
specifically for China and they just
also happen to include America because
they're like an you might like it too
apparently no and not at all but that's
like how that went down oh my goodness
razor has an app that uses your GPU to
mine crypto and apparently keeps the
coins by cinnabar sonar on the forum
do you like Razer points or something so
the app is called soft miner a desktop
app that utilizes the idle GPU
processing power of gamers battle
stations to solve complex blockchain
based puzzles on the back end Razer
rewards the owner of the PC running the
app with Razer silver which can only be
used to buy digital goods from razor
razor says in their soft minor FAQ Razer
silver is not a crypto currency it is a
loyalty rewards program we work with
crypto mining technology to harness your
computer's GPU and in turn we award you
with silver giving you access to razor's
ecosystem and suite of rewards possibly
controversial who cares really what who
cares don't run it what if you don't
realize like what if you how do you not
realize that because you're against
candy canes you're against candy cane
it's very realistic to think that there
are many people who do not understand
crypto well enough to know that Razer is
taking their money and then giving them
Razer bucks but you could mean that
isn't that basically the whole crypto
thing you could like these all the white
ones oh these are the orange ones oh you
got orange ones yeah
oh you dumped you on the table yeah so
the orange one looks like that there's a
like orange thing on the end and it says
LTTE and then the white one is more
likely to go with your RGB system
because it's just white
that's true but especially if your kale
imagining behind the back I think would
be really cool to have the orange one we
actually went through quite a few like
it's amazing how hard it is to get
something done with time in China like
it's cheap yeah like it's affordable but
there's a lot of time that you end up
spending just to get something printed
that's quality and looks acceptable and
arrives on time and is like packaged
reasonably nicely and like all this kind
of stuff so we're expecting these to go
live in the next few days they can't
really hear you very well to give
context and I think we tried working
with like or we got samples from four
different factories yeah some of them
were pretty garbage actually not usable
than these ones I wouldn't call them the
best cable ties I've ever used but I
can't think of anything that's better
like they're good so we were we were
comfortable putting the brand on them
and they look pretty nice so yeah yeah I
like the orange ones I would try to get
those if I were you guys the orange ones
are dope you're making it hard for us to
sell 90% of our inventory Luke
way to go I'm just trying to make people
go fast speaking of way to go good
either way to go you guys for watching
oh no we don't have a there's no no
viewer counter plain real high is it
it's kind of flirtin with the potential
limit of that port so what's the speed
of that port not the speed the maximum
connections thanks for coming out all
right thanks guys
oh we didn't do like any super chats or
like floatplane chat oh lordy okay Stu i
speaking of Samsung what do you guys
think of recent news the Samsung Galaxy
gold being priced at ATS more
specifically what I should say I think
it's a matter of time before the actual
smartphone manufacturer is the Sam
and apples of the world I think it's a
matter of time before they clue in that
third parties are already reselling
their phones for six thousand dollars
with goofy skins built into them and
just do it themselves yes this is this
is happening
Jake asks new tech showdown I don't
think so I don't think yeah I don't
don't know mate says Merry Saturday
because he's Australian New Zealand New
Zealand yeah don't say that names cool
they don't like that hi Thomas bear hi
musical pumpkin please make a
compensator 3.0 we don't even know what
we would put in it it's they they kind
of that's not really like a thing
anymore really first of all our average
video is basically compensator 17 every
time these days and then which is like
it's great but then also the idea of
compensator doesn't really makes sense
because they nerfed the heck out of SLI
so like it's the yeah it's a different
concept it's it's great I like the new
concept it's just the original concept
of compensator doesn't relieve we were
basically trying to show that it's
really stupid to put four graphics cards
in your system and now it's like you can
but they won't really work that way
Heineken SD Ackman how's our gamers the
amount of like is so damn high lol thank
you from the bottom of my heart for
saying how stupid the candy cane ban is
you spent 15 bucks for being mad about
candy canes getting banned I can get mad
about all kinds of stuff if you guys
will pay me well it's not so much
getting mad about them as just like you
know what you want to open up these
floodgates cuz like I think Nick and
Luke can tell you I can get real mad
about an awful lot of stuff oh yeah oh
yeah alright I think that's pretty much
it everyone thank you guys for tuning in
and we will see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
thanks j-rock
is that the one who posted in floatplane
shot that some people have multiple tabs
open just like guys do whatever no
problem I'm just gonna go put the fire
out it's hot it's all good
no problem
I'm sorry Nick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
