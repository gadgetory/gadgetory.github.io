product this is the Strider Series 1500
watt power supply from silverstone and
what makes this unique is the fact that
it is a 80 plus Silver certified and B
it is one of the highest wattage power
supplies available on the market it is
also a 100% modular design and I will
show you what that means in a moment but
why don't I get the cameraman to take a
quick look at the actual specs for this
unit so you can see it is an 8 rail
power supply so that means it has eight
12-volt rails each Specht up to a max of
25 amps each okay
so it uses probably yeah 135 millimeters
silent fan and they're saying that the
noise level is as low as 19 decibels so
that's incredibly silent and that is
again one of the things they've called
out right on the front this is a low
noise power supply now let's get this
thing open okay here we've got a summary
of all the connectors on it too so you
have a 24-pin connector an EPS 8 pin
connector which is also a 4 plus 4 and
then you have an EPS 8 pin just native
connector for floppy connectors that's a
lot of those actually for 6 pin PCI
Express for 6 pin 6 plus 2 pin PCI
Express then you have 12 molex and 12
SATA so lets you can connect pretty much
whatever you could possibly want to this
power supply as many as wow I guess you
could do four graphics cards depending
on how they've configured the modular
cable design which we won't have a look
at in just a woman here if I can get the
Box open it seems to be ok power supply
this power supply is capable of drawing
a very high amount of current and
electricity be attentive to use only the
power cord included with the power
supply and do not use an extension cable
or a power strip with this power supply
1500 was is a lot of juice folks so this
is the dream PSU for computer
enthusiasts ok awesome
and remember too that if your pull if
you're powering your PC with 1500 watts
you're actually
more than that from the wall because
even though it's 80 plus it should be
around 80 86 to 87 percent efficiency
you're actually drawing that extra few
percent from the wall even though you're
not able to use it so this is power
power supply interesting okay so this is
your manual it's available in a bunch of
different languages how to install a
bunch of basic information on the power
supply itself including the pin outs for
all the different connectors okay great
let's take this foam out
okay you know let's do the rest of the
accessories first so inside here what I
think we're going to find is a power
cord and that is what we're going to
find but we're also going to find like a
pouch to hold your extra modular cables
in okay and then here's like a super
thick power supply cable and it actually
uses a non-standard configuration so
this is designed to be used only with
this power supply and I think I've seen
a couple others before that are like
that okay we got a couple adapters here
so this is six plus two PCIe and it
takes two six pins at the back okay so
it's an adapter I don't like to see
adapters like this on a fully modular
power supply it seems kind of
unnecessary we've got some velcro cable
management ties as well as some thumb
screws as well as the regular zip ties
for cable management and then here we go
this is a long power supply Wow
this thing is absolutely gianormous as
if that's a word there you go so that is
a 135 millimeter fan and even so you've
got large strips of unused area on
either side of this unit I mean this
thing is huge
so there's your general specs again on
the side as well as I you're cautioning
blah blah blah okay I've got a silver
stone stamp on the top you've got a
regular honeycomb grille with your
special power supply cord input on the
side and then nothing over here now at
this side of the power supply we're
gonna find what is one of the coolest
features of this unit the 100% modular
interface that it has so you can plug in
up to for purpose let me see I'm gonna
make sure I'm right here before I say
this up to four peripherals so this is
molex or SATA and then the bottom ones
are up to six one two three four yeah
six PCI Express connectors along the
bottom and then you even the 24 pin ATX
connector is modular on this power
supply so that's very cool I mean
there's no reason you wouldn't have that
plugged in oh I'm sorry okay no it is
for PCI Express and then these two on
over here are the two eight pin EPS
connectors sorry sorry okay so why don't
we have a look at which connector
silverstone deems necessary to include
by default with this unit okay bye yeah
PCI Express we've got oh okay so they're
using actual actually like two PCI
Express connectors per plug at the back
so by default it comes with two 6 plus
twos three four six plus two connectors
and then four additional six pin
connectors so eight PCI Express
connectors just right out right out of
the gate and then it also includes those
adapters to turn your other six pins
into an additional two six plus two pins
so that's six six plus two pin
connectors that's ridiculous Wow okay so
there's your ApS and you're ATX four pin
four plus four and then they've also
included
dudududududududu yeah two molex and two
SATA attached by default and then you've
got the additional ones here so you can
switch to whichever cable configuration
you would like cuz it's a modular power
supply
