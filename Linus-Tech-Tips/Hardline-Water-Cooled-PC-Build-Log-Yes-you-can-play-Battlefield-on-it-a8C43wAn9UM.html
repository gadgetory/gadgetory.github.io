deja vu moment are you yeah a little bit
so guys welcome to the hardline build
log that was doomed for failure from the
very start between you event a little
bit too far bent a little too far it got
misshapen and you know when that happens
at the wrong moment trust me
awkwardness and pain can ensue so let's
go ahead and do a quick introduction to
the project I'll show you guys the tools
we'll be using to do your very own hard
line system so basically we're running
an Intel Core i7 59 60 X octa-core CPU
we've got that running on an X 99 deluxe
motherboard from a seuss graphics cards
we got two 980 s which are both hard
piped into the system as well and
water-cooled with a couple of blocks
from ek water blocks they actually
provided all of the water cooling we're
powering this sucker with an ax 1500 I
power supply because overkill we know
it's overkill we could have used
something half that capacity that would
have been just fine I'm speaking of half
that capacity would have been just fine
we've got 32 gigs of DDR 4 memory in
there that's Dominator Platinum's what
else have we completely overdone massive
reservoir but I actually like the fact
that we have a massive reservoir because
topping this thing off is gonna suck and
oh right of course all the hard line
tubing tools so it starts with the hard
line tubing and hard line tubing is
important because compared to flexible
tubing you want one of these or you want
one of those that's awful really good
but yeah one of these uh ptg yes so
that's important because PE TG is more
is less fragile so it's less prone to
breakage and cracking it allows for more
reattempt at bends and is just generally
much easier to work with it's less
likely to lose its shape when you're
bending it with this fuel line stuff
that we'll be using what else we got
here Oh compression fittings these are
special hard line compression fittings
that we'll be using throughout the build
they're from primo chill they actually
sent us a couple different styles we
like the knurled black ones clubs are
actually surprisingly important
because while you're bending the the
tubing the PPG tubing is probably going
to be really hot so you're going to want
some kind of gloves you don't need to be
too crazy and we got this baby to do the
bender yep
do the bender so this is the this is the
bend of the rigid bender from primo
chill the last thing is I guess we've
got a saw and an a heat gun also really
important how did I forget the heat gun
because you also have to heat up the PDG
that's why you need the gloves so you
can bend it around the bender and maybe
ties it with so guys this is going to be
an absolute blast I is gonna kind of
start in the middle yeah it was a blast
cuz we're done and we've lost some
footage so we're redoing our intro enjoy
fractal design listens and the define
are five case was made with feedback
from you the PC community so click
wherever you want to learn more how
about here and here and then it's like
step to continued remove the rest of
them like okay why don't I just remove
them all sleeping the screws part one a
yeah sounds like a - media group video
cause any encoded bits of information in
brass for metal you think ek includes
enough thermal pads to basically do this
twice so you achieved a hole in a piece
of metal in the last you know 20 minutes
here's what I did about 20 moves I did I
done better cool you're not though dick
never got the whole angelina jolie thing
I don't know if I've ever said that on
camera before I'm sure it will
oh yeah incite riots yeah talented yes
attractive no all right and then it's
like I had kind of a panic moment
because ek sent two of the CPU blocks
two different kinds and I kind of went
oh they sent to GPU blocks wow I really
hope when I asked for two GPU blocks
they knew that I meant I wanted matching
ones and they were going in the same
system they're okay though they're the
same so we're getting close to starting
okay there is something that we do still
have to do though we have to get this
radiator mounted so that means we have
to decide like how that's how that's
working exactly so the pump wait till
the pump is going to take from here oh
yeah we got to drill the holes to mount
the reservoir as well okay so we're not
we're not that closer to starting and
the problem is that that radiator
actually has a variety of different
holes it can mount to none of which it
can access because you see how this
radiator is actually a touch wider than
a 120mm fan most rads are flush with the
fan so I actually can't quite get over
far enough this way and quite can't
quite get over far enough that way to
hit these mounting holes how about right
there you're supposed to see like the
alignment and stuff
you're that like is it super awful or is
it like it's not directly mine yeah I
don't know if we're gonna get that
without just doing new holes and like
having some places where the where the
grill is just there you can screw it in
because it's not like it's gonna feed
directly from that we might have some
but it would be there wouldn't be any
kind of organized system to them okay so
all those spots I marked basically the
holes that are there need to be widened
okay so I got a ghetto drill or find a
bit that's good for it if I'm ghetto
drilling no on a bit that's good for it
I think forget it really then don't film
it okay you remember how our genius plan
was to fill it from the top there's a
radiator so no good yeah unless the this
is oh no that wasn't the hole we were
planning to go through that's I think
that's too small I think it was oh
that's not what I was crying did you
it's okay it definitely wasn't over here
we can come in here though and just go
I'm just getting discarnate sure yeah I
think I think it'll be fine um but I
believe I believe I could fly wow this
is never been open I believe I can touch
the sky about it ever done yeah I think
this is gonna work but this will come
out at a bit of an angle but it might be
okay because it's gonna come out at this
angle and then go up to the CPU so I
think we should be golden as long as
there are no clearance issues with the
graphics cards where are they oh but
then we were doing our test fit with um
freaking the air coolers on there's a
drill bit here my OCD is uh really angry
I legitimately went and bought a whole
new set of that after whole room water
cooling because people lost a couple of
the pieces from it so that is now
officially the lmg set with it's missing
pieces that will make me crazy if I have
to look at them normally hold it for me
sure
can Brandon watch like I guess that so
he's into that okay we should do this
outside though I think cuz you gotta
take it out to do those um the devil
thing anyway
yeah it's like a disaster down there
well I was given a cutting it I know
that why - media group push forward with
no regard for the consequences these are
just grabbing the edge if I was gonna do
this somewhat properly I definitely put
washers on them because it's been a
little beat really dusty my board well
what happens when it sits on the test
bench I guess so interference issues
gone alright alright I'm feeling good
yeah I learned the power supply go I'm
gonna put in the power supply I was
thinking maybe I would but if it oh yeah
push push push yeah okay good
our final our decision you want to do
black and white or clear there would
work pretty well and the res is going to
be clear we can't color it so the res is
gonna look kind of out of place these
don't look the same okay now I'm a
little worried is one of these like UV
blue or something you know what let's go
for let's go for the home run swing
because the black and white thing is
gonna either look really cool or super
dumb yeah let's go for the home run
swing ah hold still you bastard
whoa put that up against there and oh I
don't
90 degrees it show okay that's not quite
so then you just hold it until it
hardens our very first bed well here
I'll I'll chat with you so we are deeply
worried about having enough tubing
because primo chill bless their hearts
sent us one stick of each color maybe
they intended to send it to us just as a
sample so we could then tell them what
color we wanted to do this project and
they could send us a whack of it because
we have zero room for error if we have
enough tubing at all and we're not sure
which of those is the answer right now
so we're thinking we're thinking a white
run here which is going to be like half
or more of the rest of our white oops
okay so like kind of there too there
then we're thinking ah this is going to
have to go to here and that'll have to
be black this one will be white which
will use up pretty much the rest of our
white not a whole lot of room for error
and then this one will be black down to
here and then this one over here will be
black as well and I think we're gonna
just make it let's put that in you clean
off the marks with isopropyl first if
you don't mind that's alcohol it was not
taking it off hmmm that came off these
came off it's the heat
oh crap and now I don't have my damn
marks oh oh my goodness I just went the
wrong way on it holy crap that was close
okay can you just hey Wow
I am like No
I didn't put the thing in see how the my
pressure from the bend is really makes
it really flat here yeah I figured out
how to do it more like that oh so what
you got to do is you got to heat up the
rest of it so that's the least soft part
so then when you press it against it
burns more holes that make sense yeah
and it doesn't dent into it so much
oh no it's ugly it's hideous
ah come on I'm gonna chop it off I don't
think so
I cut it already in right away great
yeah people are gonna see this video and
they're gonna be like well these idiots
can do it maybe that's the point of -
tech tips all right should we fill this
sucker yeah man all right so we've got
our fitting up there no no everything's
okay I think I thought I saw something
drew I've got some 1/2 inch tubing up
here that's going to take a while so you
take a really long time so what's cool -
about this hard pipe tubing is that its
inner diameter is very small so the
actual amount of liquid in the loop is
not very much a total volume yeah it's
gonna be like radiators and the
reservoir basically
stop okay that's not that bad
we did all right yeah hold on okay you
got the weight no memory
kind of like bearish there we go and got
it
that was fun that was really fun that
was actually that was really fun were
you learning a lot
oh I think thing number one that I
learned is that to two things of piping
is like no no no margin for error in a
case this size if you guys are gonna do
a hard line build because lift like long
runs in a big case I think if you got a
single color get three yeah yeah and
then if you want to do a two-tone thing
like us then like four yeah I'd probably
say form one of each two of each color
sorry
I mean Jeffy made it but Jeffy we
probably would have put them down
if we'd have the option to redo Jeffy we
probably would have so so that's
something that you want to build into
your your bill of materials the other
thing I think I took away from this is
that I wouldn't recommend a hard line
tubing system for your first
water-cooled build software softer
tubing is way easier to work with like
you just kind of add a belt like that
and you're a little if it's too long
it's fine so so there's a lot more room
for error even for people who are
experienced water coolers I still
wouldn't do this personally like because
for me I can do a graphics card swap on
my liquid-cooled build in like 10
minutes
this you are definitely draining most of
your loop if not all of it
you are definitely redoing some bends
it's it's a lot more work but I think
the result justifies it it looks
absolutely stunning so if you were
someone who maybe you're not even
building for yourself where you're going
to get frequent upgrades or something
yeah I think it makes the production
values of the system look way better
just I mean this isn't that this is
definitely one of my favorite builds
that I've ever done or been involved in
like what would be better
the only ones like together I'd say the
mineral oil bill
it's my handle I really like that build
yep but like for a more standard
computer this right probably my favorite
or if not my second I think that my
overkill build guide that red one I did
in the 900 I was like five radiators and
all the Noctua fans and like all that
stuff I think that still takes it where
as but this one even though it's not
like it's almost as high-end costs way
less yeah and actually looks cleaner
yeah looks cleaner overall that one I
just loved for the just sheer because
over done this I can't even move red I
couldn't even move it five radiators so
um yeah great build lots of fun I hope
you guys enjoyed it as much as we did
but I am like super hungry so if we've
been ads all day how are we got this
total nine hours from oh yeah must have
been just as painful for whoever was
shooting it thanks thanks by the way
yeah anything it's gonna be a nightmare
so guys thanks for watching like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it just plain suck leave a
comment on the forum which is linked in
the video description if you want to
chat with our community or with us about
this build blog and all that good stuff
as always also linked in the video
description is a place for you buy a
cool t-shirt like this one like for once
could you wear a line Aztec to t-shirt I
told them all he has to do is order them
I'll reimburse it for them it doesn't
order the t-shirts there weren't packs
that's what you did do that also linked
in the video description is a place
where you can give us monthly
contribution if you love our work you
can also change your Amazon bookmarks
one with our affiliate code that costs
you absolutely nothing but we get a
small kickback whenever you buy fans or
shirts or whatever it is you buy on
Amazon I think that pretty much wraps it
up guys don't forget to subscribe and
follow on all that good stuff if you
haven't already
