the test bench that is the brand
spanking new GeForce GT s 450 from
Nvidia this is the cyclone OC that is
overclocked edition from MSI has one gig
of ram so you can see I have the box for
it here along with a couple cards that
I'm going to be comparing it against
today so first of all we want to compare
it against the GTX 460 so you can see I
have a cyclone OC 1 gig card from MSI
for that comparison point here's the box
for the GTS 450 which is the one on the
test bench right now and because it's
one of the closest price competitors on
the ATI side although slightly more
expensive at launch the 5770 will also
be included in the comparison today
we're just going to run some simple
numbers and yeah let's see how it goes
both from a performance standpoint as
well as from a there's my energy meter
power consumption standpoint the test
platform why don't we go through that
really quick you can see I have like
ghetto plastic in between these to keep
them from touching it's because I left
my test bench and I don't really have
one to use up a moment but that's
neither here nor there we have a four
point one five gigahertz core i7 nine
ATX under a cooler here we have 12 gigs
of ocz special edition ddr3 ram a
BIGBANG X power MSI motherboard and we
have a 90 plus percent efficient fanless
power supply actually running the whole
thing so that's going to give us a
really good idea of how much power is
actually being drawn the hard drive is
going to be an ocz vertex le 200 gig
drive and I guess that pretty much
covers the test platform
all right well our Vantage run is
complete so you can see the GTS 450
scored eleven thousand four hundred and
thirty one 3d marks we have 292 hundred
of those almost ninety three hundred
being on the GPU score now I want to
just point something out this benchmark
is not particularly useful for comparing
the 450 to the 57
but when you're looking at two cards
within the same architecture family so
these are both fermi based derivatives
okay so if we compare it against the 460
it on the same platform it should give
us at least a fairly good indication of
how the power of these cards compares to
each other speaking of power before 50
maxed out at 337 watts during our
vintage test so let's bear that number
in mind for it later
next benchmark is Crysis so this is
running it 10 well 1680 by 1050 that's
the word I was looking for it is running
at you can see our last run was 61
frames per second that was the first run
out of the bench though so usually that
one goes a little bit slower so you can
see the average FPS for this particular
run-through is about 66 frames per
second like I said I'm running at 1680
by 1050
there you go sixty five point five five
is what it scored on that one I am
running with all details medium because
really we're looking at cards that are
in the 149 sort of price range for the
most part I mean this one goes up to
around 249 but you can't really expect
at all most HD resolution to be you know
turning up the details to Mac's unless
you're starting to invest in more
expensive cards like for example over
here we've got a 460 Lightning and we've
got a GTX 480 I mean if you're an
enthusiast you want to run at HD Plus
resolutions all high details
anti-aliasing etc speaking of which I'm
not using anti-aliasing those over there
are going to be the cards for you but
you can see the GTS 450 does post very
respectable numbers and I mean crisis at
medium it still looks great so that is
how that went
okay the mafia 2 run is going to be a
little bit different first of all I want
you to know that the in-game benchmark
does not actually present a very
accurate real-world scenario it runs
quite a bit slower than you'd actually I
expect from the game in the real world
so here are all the settings I'm running
and of note is the fact that again
anti-aliasing is off it's a high-end
game it's mid-range graphics card
anti-aliasing does not provide in my
opinion enough of a gameplay benefit to
sacrifice things like shadows and other
details for it okay and I have trained
physics on because unlike the other
titles we've been looking at mafia 2 is
all about the physics support if you
have an Nvidia card you better be
running it with physics on because
that's how you're going to get the best
gameplay experience alright we're just
finishing up the benchmark run here you
can see we've got an average of 33
frames per second so that's a little bit
on the low side of what I would consider
playable but yeah it gives us a point of
comparison against the other cards that
we are going to be looking at today so
here you go the performance is not
optimal rank D as I mentioned before the
actual in-game benchmark is a little bit
on the slower side compared to what you
would experience playing the game
alright these are my Arkham Asylum
options in the control panel this is
another Nvidia physics ready game so
I've gone ahead and left hardware
accelerated physics on it's set to
normal because we don't mean they
recommend really a dedicated physics
card for the high setting vsync is off
everything else is as you see here
Batman
Arkham Asylum are ready to run
doing one more round of mafia to one
small change is that the apex physics
are set to medium because I am not
running with GPU physics anymore I just
wanted to do an apples-to-apples
comparison against the 5770 just so that
we have one more point of reference here
it really is plain to see that this game
is not nearly as cool without the
physics on high I just thought I'd do a
quick clip here just to say my thoughts
on it with the with the physics on
medium running on the CPU you know the
outdoor scene in particular you can't
really notice it much in here but not
nearly as many persistent particles are
not nearly as much damage and things
like the building just way way less
interesting to to watch so besides the
less than stellar physics performance
with it on medium running on the CPU the
frame rate was quite a bit lower
you
so in conclusion I give it about a
c-plus that is my video review not the
card itself I think I might just stick
to the whole unboxings product showcases
gameplay videos simpler things like that
because stringing together a complete
review seems to be too complicated for
me for whatever reason but anyway let's
talk a little bit about the conclusions
about this card first of all this is the
cyclone cooler card I'm gonna have some
separate videos coming up in the next
little while where I'm going to show
some overclocking numbers I'm going to
show some acoustic numbers well not
really numbers but some acoustic
characteristics of it because really the
test bench I had was far too loud for
you to appreciate how quiet the card is
so I have to put together a silent test
bench so I can kind of do my hole here
I'm gonna hold the camera close to the
card you can see how quiet it is thing
so that should be fine as far as the
performance versus the price goes power
consumption is slightly improved over
the 460 Series card and the price to
performance ratio still looks quite good
now it's not white 57 70 or 57 50 killer
but I mean knowing in video we're gonna
see mi RS from their partners we're
gonna probably see some IRS come into
effect and I think that it will become a
very very strong contender especially
when you consider that it has features
that you don't necessarily find on
competing products I mean mafia 2 is a
great example of a game that you really
can enjoy on a GTS 450 I mean yeah not
to the same level as with a 460 but you
can have a good experience with it at
sub HD resolutions and with physics you
really do get a better gameplay
experience so I mean that's something to
really bear in mind about a card like
this thank you for checking out my I
guess first attempt at a real video
review and don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips that was pretty much it
oh no one more thing yes if you want to
get the best performance possible
don't forget use the latest version of
After Burner from msi 2.0 that will give
you all of the voltage adjustments that
you can do on this card and also use the
latest drivers from Nvidia their new 260
Series drivers that'll give you better
performance on this as well as many
other Fermi based cards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
