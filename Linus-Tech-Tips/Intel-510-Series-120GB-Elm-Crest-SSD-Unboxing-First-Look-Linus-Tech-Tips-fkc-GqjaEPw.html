exciting product this is the second to
market say 236 gigabit per second SSD so
this is the Intel 510 series this is a
120 gigabyte superfast according to
Intel and I believe them superfast hard
drive replacement drive it is high
performance it is for desktop and mobile
systems so this is a two-and-a-half-inch
drive and it includes a desktop
installation kit that is how they
achieve that so here we find Intel's
product information so you can see here
this is a 510 series 120 gig capacity
drive okay there's not a whole lot else
on here other than the pack date which
is january twenty eight twenty eleven so
intel being ready for launches as they
always are has these boxed up fully
retail ready to go well before launch
this box includes well we'll get to that
once we actually open it and let's see
what else intelius to say for themselves
do more weight less superfast hard drive
alternative rugged silence solid say 26
gigabit per second and three gigabit per
second compatible now Intel with their
usual tradition is providing or in line
with their usual tradition is providing
a three year warranty on this product
and look at this top sealed okay this
side is sealed let's break the seal just
because that's part of what I enjoy
doing there we go aah open this baby up
I'm actually really excited about this
so the first state of 36 gave it per
second SSD on the market was the crucial
c300 and here we are we finally have an
answer from Intel one of the big players
in the SSD market they really shook
things up and they released the original
x25-m so there's the SSD itself let's go
a little bit further in and see what
else we got ooh I love stickers I
actually I actually really love stickers
so this is a pretty nice sticker I would
actually be pretty content to put this
on something speed demon look at barcode
alright just in case until needs to
track their sticker inventory intel SATA
solid-state drive here's a little thing
thank you for purchasing in a wide
variety of different languages basically
thank you for purchasing okay next we've
got one of those little mini CDs that I
think are adorable nut up what's this
okay installation guide and warranty all
on disk nice okay next we've got more
environmentally friendly packaging hey
look at that it comes with a SATA cable
it's high class not a very nice data
cable mind you that's a very thin thin
SATA cable I'm going to get your own
SATA cable but my assumption is that
this is in spite of its thinness and
flexible you know you could argue that
thin and flexible is an advantage for
SATA cable it's got to be rated for say
26 gigabit per second because it does
come with a say 26 gigabit per second
drive if I could get it to focus we
could see what it's called here there it
is what is that amphenol cool I think
we've also got a molex to SATA power
adapter included in the packaging look
at that a locking say to power adapter
higher connector I haven't actually seen
one of those before interesting we've
got some screws there's case screws they
include an extra one just in case and
then here screws for the SSD itself to
bolt to the tuna half inch to three and
a half inch adapter and they include an
extra one of those just in case as well
nice little touch from Intel here's the
adapter so you mount one drive on there
you mount this in your three and a half
inch and then you're good to go nice
solid steel adapted okay now we get to
the goods here so we've got a careful
observed precautions for handling this
device and that is a lot you can we
break that sticker once you can see it
leaves behind an ugly residue okay then
we have
we have some do not eat and the SSD
itself so here is the Intel SSD 510
series it uses a silver housing unlike
you know what I think the first SSD
sample I ever got was this one right
here so that is my intel x25-m 80 gig
and it was black and it had kind of a
little plastic rich thing on it so it
could be installed in varying
thicknesses of notebook mounting
mechanisms so this is actually the next
intel SSD sample I've received so it'll
be interesting to see in terms of
aesthetics and in terms of performance
how far they have come so we've got some
specs here there's the six gigabit SATA
SSD so remember to guys that say 26
gigabit per second is physically
identical to say 23 gigabit per second
as well stay 2 1 150 megabit per second
so you don't have to worry about any
backwards compatibility issues
physically now some older chipsets like
maybe say 21 chipsets might have trouble
with this a 26 drive although there's no
reason to believe they would necessarily
but just something to bear in mind Intel
does specifically say though that it is
compatible with say 236 gave it per
second and say 223 gigabit per second so
it's got its usual mounting holes on the
sides usual interface at the back usual
mounting holes on the bottom and ooh
this is interesting ok ok it looks like
we're going to looks like we're going to
be doing a longer video than I had
originally thought here because you can
just dig into my backpack here find a
screwdriver there are no warranty void
if remove stickers on this dry so we're
going to be opening this guy up and
finding out what there is what mysteries
it holds inside so there's one screw
sorry guys I apologize because it's a
six-minute unboxing of a drive already
but oh yeah performance why don't I talk
about
moments while we do this so intel spec
this drive for up to four hundred and
seventy megabytes per second read and up
to three hundred and fifty megabytes per
second write speeds so what that means
is that this is fully justified in using
a say 236 gigabit per second interface
now there are some say 236 gigabit per
second hard drives out there that really
don't even begin to approach needing
that kind of sorry these are really hard
to remove needing that kind of bandwidth
for the amount of data that they can
actually read and write sequentially now
this drive also uses actual okay I'm not
going to spell that surprised but in
terms of its spec its spec for up to
20,000 4k random reads per second and
fifty thousand 4k random writes per
second okay uses here we go intel flash
this is 34 nanometer flash and a marvel
controller let's go ahead and take this
PCB out of here so it's double-sided ok
so we've got eight chips on the one side
ate chips as well as what appears to be
a cache so we've got a controller a
cache and then a 16 chip solution intel
also saw calls out that it's
specifically compatible if there's six
series chipsets although it'll work just
fine probably with any other say 236
gigabit per second controller and it is
available in two capacities the 120 gig
that we are looking at here today and at
launch it is also available in a 250 gig
configuration do not take your drive
apart the way that i have i don't
recommend it that is not what tech tips
is all about it's about me doing it so
you don't have to but other than that

this drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
