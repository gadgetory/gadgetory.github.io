pocket cinema camera I didn't think the
camera could get any smaller to my
surprise black magic has done it again
with their micro cinema camera line is
tech tips coverage of NAB 2015 is
brought to you by sennheiser kingston SD
cards and Linda calm the sensor on the
micro Cinema Camera is a super 16
millimeter sensor with a claimed rating
of 13 stops of dynamic range the sensor
also has both a global and rolling
shutter similarly to the newly announced
Ursa mini for the lens mount of black
magic has continued using the active
micro four thirds lens mode just like on
the pocket cinema camera moving on to
physical aspects the camera controls are
now on the front of the camera initially
this decision might seem odd but if you
look past it it makes a lot of sense
black magic has designed this camera to
be used on small to medium sized drones
with the controls on the front you'll be
able to easily access all you need on
the camera without having to reach
around awkwardly not knowing if you're
pushing the correct button moving on to
i/o on the camera on the right side it
has a full-size HDMI black magics new
expansion port which can be used to make
specialized cables that can control the
settings of the camera one example they
had was rigging it to work with an RC
remote for wireless control of all of
the settings on the left side of the
camera we find an SD card slot and
microphone input for when you want to
attach an external mic the micro camera
is capable of raw recording as well as
many flavors of Apple ProRes for power
black magic has gone with the widely
used canon l pe6 battery which many
shooters will already have plenty of
from using Canon DSLRs black magic also
announced a second variation on the
micro camera which has an ever so
slightly larger sensor that is 4k
capable this version of the camera is
geared more towards broadcast production
trading its internal SD card recording
slot for a6 gsci in and out while not a
direct competitor to say an action
camera this camera is a good alternative
if you need a high quality image that
records to a more robust codec than
others in the market I can see this
camera being used as a crash cam or a
high quality way to get shots that you
wouldn't be able to fit a traditional
camera in at a price point of 995
dollars for the standard version and
1295 for the 4k version black magic has
continued their trend of bringing
affordable quality to the masses thank
