pocket Cinema Camera I didn't think the
camera could get any smaller
to my surprise Blackmagic has done it
again with their Micro Cinema Camera
line is tech tips coverage of NAB 2015
is brought to you by Sennheiser kingston
SD cards and lynda.com the sensor on the
micro Cinema Camera is a super 16
millimeter sensor with a claimed rating
of 13 stops of dynamic range the sensor
also has both a global and rolling
shutter similarly to the newly announced
Ursa mini for the lens mount Blackmagic
has continued using the active Micro
Four Thirds lens mount just like on the
pocket Cinema Camera
moving on to physical specs the camera
controls are now on the front of the
camera initially this decision might
seem odd but if you look past it it
makes a lot of sense Blackmagic has
designed this camera to be used on small
to medium sized drones with the controls
on the front you'll be able to easily
access all you need on the camera
without having to reach around awkwardly
not knowing if you're pushing the
correct button
moving on to IO on the camera on the
right side it has a full size HDMI black
magics new expansion port which can be
used to make specialized cables that can
control the settings of the camera one
example they had was rigging it to work
with an RC remote for wireless control
of all of the settings on the left side
of the camera we find an SD card slot
and microphone input for when you want
to attach an external mic the micro
camera is capable of raw recording as
well as many flavors of Apple ProRes for
power Blackmagic has gone with the
widely used Canon LP e6 battery which
many shooters will already have plenty
up from using Canon DSLRs
Blackmagic also announced a second
variation on the micro camera which has
an ever so slightly larger sensor that
is 4k capable this version of the camera
is geared more towards broadcast
production trading its internal SD card
recording slot for a 6g SDI in and out
while not a direct competitor to say an
action camera this camera is a good
alternative if you need a high quality
image that records to a more robust
codec than others in the market I can
see this camera being used as a crash
cam or a high-quality way to get shots
that you wouldn't be able to fit a
traditional camera in at a price point
of 995 dollars for the standard version
and 1295 for the 4k version Blackmagic
has continued their trend of bringing
affordable quality to the masses thank
