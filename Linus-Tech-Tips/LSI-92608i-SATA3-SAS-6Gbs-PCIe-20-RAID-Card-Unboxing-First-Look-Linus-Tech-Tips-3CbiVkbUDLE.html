excited to do for a while this is an LSI
mega raid SAS 9268 eye raid controller
card so this is exciting because it is a
six gigabit per second eight port SAS
and SATA raid card so what that means is
you've actually got full support for
either SAS or SATA drives and either
three gigabit per second or six gigabit
per second so it's one of the most
flexible raid cards out there today now
the difference between SAS and SATA I've
actually been asked this before SAS are
basically enterprise level drives and
SATA our consumer level drives you can
run a SATA Drive on a SAS interface card
but you cannot run a SAS drive on a SATA
interface like what you would find built
into a motherboard so there that is the
difference here we're going to find the
product specifications in brief so I'm
going to go ahead and scan these for you
so you can read them if you really want
it supports all the usual raid levels
and all the usual monitoring etc things
that you might need you've got support
for all the latest operating systems and
you can always of course haha how often
do I say this download the latest
drivers from the manufacturer website
Thank You LSI for mentioning that you've
got theirs calling out that they are the
most trusted raid for critical data okay
they've also got advanced trade
management software and they're just
talking a little bit about that on the
box but what I am most interested in
about this particular product is coming
up shortly that was a teaser
that's a something that I use from time
to time to get people to keep watching
the video even when it's a product that
probably doesn't have a whole lot of
implications for the average consumer
maybe you'll learn a little bit of
something about raid during this video
probably not I do have some more raid
themed videos upcoming everyone's been
bothering me about that and they are
coming trust me
it's just been it's been a little bit
hectic and there's there's a lot that I
want to do with those particular videos
so the first thing we find inside is
what appears to be a quick installation
guide checkout it I'm Pat step one on
pack the RAID controller nice okay step
two prepare the computer by turning it
off unplugging the power step three
review the jumpers and connectors and
how much further does this go Wow quite
a few steps so this is quite detailed it
includes some picture diagrams it
includes a whole bunch of steps and hey
look at that it talks about raid so if
you want to know what raid is you could
freeze the video right now and read that
otherwise you can stay tuned for when
I'll be doing a video shortly all right
you've got a technical support number on
the back and there's some more raid
levels in case you were wondering about
that there we go okay next we have
replacing the full profile bracket with
low profile brackets how to do it okay
next we have a reduction of hazardous
substances report saying that this one
is okay so it is RoHS compliant we've
got the card itself we'll have a look at
that in a moment and then underneath it
looks like we have a cable kit so not
all raid controllers come with cable
kits you got to check the part number to
see if it's a bare card or one that
comes with cables it doesn't actually
matter because you can buy cables
usually for about the same price as it
would cost to buy a drive with a cable
kit so then it's up to you which route
you want to go okay so in terms of
accessories we have the low profile
adapter as you can see it comes with the
full height adapter so that's if you're
installing it in a 1u chassis or
anything else that would require a
low-profile adapter we've got a couple
of adapters eyeglass SFF 8087 I believe
is what this connector is called
although feel free to correct me if I'm
wrong and then that goes to four
discreet SATA / SAS cables on the other
side so we have two of those because
this is an eight port card next we have
a drivers utilities and documentation
DVD so you might not want to throw this
particular DVD away because it does have
some documentation on it probably how to
use their software and a bunch of stuff
along those lines next we have the card
itself here we have it so these
interfaces are actually in a rather
peculiar place on this card so they plug
in right here
one two and then out of there you're
going to be able to plug into eight
drives directly or you can actually use
splitters in order to plug this
particular card into up to shoot I don't
know if it says that on the box but up
to 32 SAS or SATA devices there you go
so you can split each one so we've got
eight lines 32 so you can split each one
of these connectors four ways if you're
using magnetic drives that probably
makes a lot of sense but if you're going
to be doing what I'm going to be doing
with this card it probably doesn't make
much sense because we're going to be
trying to find the absolute limit in
thorough put for this card with some
rule eight SSD drive so the onyx series
SSD drive that I unboxed recently I have
eight of these and I'm going to be
hooking them all up to this particular
RAID controller to see what kind of
numbers we can pull through it I also
have a battery backup unit so battery
backups actually here this is going to
be a little lesson on rate battery
backups are extremely important because
the RAID controller actually uses
onboard memory in this case 512 Meg's of
onboard memory so you can see those
modules are here and there are none on
the back to to as a cache so with a
normal drive cache any data that's being
held in the cache if the system is
powered off or basically if the system
loses power for any reason is
potentially lost if it's waiting to be
written to the drives and because these
dedicated raid controllers have such
enormous caches compared to a typical
hard drive where you might see a 32 to
64 Meg cache being done pretty much on
the high end of what you'd see well it's
it's a lot more dangerous to have so
much more data just sitting in a cache
waiting to be written when the system is
powered off so what a battery backup
does is it actually provides power to
the caches in the event that the system
loses power and what that does is it
allows the data to stay there until it
can be written to the drives when the
system is powered back on this is
especially in
or for anything that is mission-critical
which is typically where you'd be
looking at using something like a
high-end raid card like this well thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the LSI mega raid SAS 9268
I and hopefully I will have some very
cool videos for you shortly showing off
the SSD capabilities of this particular
card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
