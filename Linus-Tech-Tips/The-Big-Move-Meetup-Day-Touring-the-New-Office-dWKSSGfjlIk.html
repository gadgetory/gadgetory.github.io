so we did a straw poll trying to find
out exactly how many people are going to
be here today and apparently like 500
people replied we're a little bit
worried about battle though we did get
sort of more people than I was
necessarily hoping for you guys are all
awesome thank you for being here
so for those of you who could not see
the signs on the front of the buildings
Luke and I are doing tours of the new
office over there this is the garage
sale lineup and someone want Krispy
Kremes that's super awesome we have a
keep on digging t-shirt for you yeah
we're gonna we're going to get the tour
start at the base gonna be open to the
second and thank you all for coming
we'll be kind of coming out in and kind
of hanging out and all that kind of
stuff and yes sorry we wish we were more
organized but you guys knew this coming
into this I hope oh yeah there's gonna
be a couple cool things today I'm going
to try and do one right away we're going
to be doing to live on boxing's neither
of which I know what is inside the box
so one of them is a mystery item from
Intel one of them is a mystery
ultra-wide Heroes thing from LG and a
special thank you to everyone who drew
overflow to be here you guys are
unbelievable the ones who want whatever
okay so we're gonna go get tour started
thanks guys
intel is bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check the link in the
video description to learn more
Wow there's bar appear to be expected
Karen you want a nametag sure so so
these people shut up for the tour and
the garage sale has a lot bigger all
right all this people is just sitting
here
oh you're right okay sign my thing sure
what is it
it's my gear this is the shortest line
the shortest line with the smartest mine
lines I'm gonna film this to order
everyone can have the experience of a
tour hello Hey alright okay everyone
come on monotone I apologize for the
paint smell this uh lady was literally
painted this morning um so yeah this
this was done this morning this is kind
of what we want people to see when they
first walk in the rest of it kind of
looks more normal come on it
on the right are our storage closet and
the line of sanity closet the sanity
closet contains anything - never ever
wants to see so if you guys have ever
seen our previous video tour you guys
will know that our old office was not
very organized and extraordinarily messy
and there was like just be too much
stuff everywhere I spent about three
hours finding this you want to know
what's special about it it will fit high
profile ram extended ATX motherboard
this one does standard with Ram install
but it was like 60 bucks I was like well
you gotta be kidding me
you know what the problem is it's a
school supply item so they just expect
it's a bunch of government funding these
are the carts these are for anything
that is being worked on right now so the
solution to graphics card storage ended
up being a shoe rack
everyone's workstation is using an up
desk so what's great about these is it's
better for Organ omits like we couldn't
afford this kind of stuff in the early
days of life media creator blades trade
up they have a smoother action finer
control and they have presets so we
absolutely love these these are op desk
oh yeah we also upgraded all of our
chairs so everyone this was actually
provided by max anomic and up desk those
guys are awesome so they gave us one
super comfy racing chair for everyone in
the company so there are definitely
cookies come on Otis is warehouse guys
this is going to be the workshop so this
will be anything like ah hey we're doing
like a weird mod or we're building a PC
or we're competing to see who can bike
mod best PC they built some variation of
scrapyard Wars pcs yes exactly
scrapyard Wars please Brad yard Wars so
we're going to actually equip it with
actual tools cover our pegboard and get
your oppressive the stuff like was my
idea by the way
Thank You Taryn yes here honest I want
to be able to work on actual stuff at
work over here is going to be the LAN
show so I believe these metal sheets are
going to be part of the painstakingly
crafted reclaimed avoid backdrop here so
these pallets were all hand disassembled
with the nails pen removed by not other
than Justin who is here somewhere they
were slapped up onto the wall by our
carpenter and this is going to be the
LAN show from now on this is our new
green-screen Claudia how many of you are
like building guys or camera guys or
anything like that but are any of you
feel for camera guys I am so someone
tell me what's important for getting a
good key on a green screen yes yes it
has to be flat both in terms of its
flatness and in terms of the finish of
the surface so we're going to be using
Rosco green screen and paint which
actually manages the bounce light and
scatters it in a very predictable way
what else is important this distance hey
that's the big one so yeah
our old green screen setup was this
about how much distance we had between
the shooter and cameras in front of you
mind you the subject and the screen very
difficult to get the third important
thing about a green screen even
illumination so you want to light it
evenly you want to have a flat surface
and you want to have distance between
your subject and the green screen
because what happens but to tell the guy
you're gonna get
you yes you know that that godly halo
that I have around me and all of our
fastest possible videos it's not on
purpose we don't want that
it's from the green light bouncing off
of the screen onto the edges of me from
behind so the way we'll be shooting on
this is I'm going to be standing way the
crap out here we're going to have a
camera set up about at that rack next to
Harry Potter's closet under the stairs
you're going to be able to do full body
height being screening because we have
this fancy pants / built into the bottom
here that's my idea and we're gonna
paint the three of you as well thank you
Taryn so we will be able to do anything
with our fancy new green-screen
yes PD the lightest and the reason film
a ik is for a couple of reasons number
one it is constructed of modular panels
it's just in a in a space like this who
knows we might want to completely you
know reconfigure what it looks like the
other reason it's huge is because this
gives us a few different looks depending
on what kind of product it is so let's
say it's a more consumer electronics
product maybe I have like a couch a TV
in the background we shoot this way
maybe it's something else and keep this
football ideas
so brendan has been begging way to cart
around well this is an empty one so it's
less of a good example but to cart
around his sea stance which hold things
like light reflectors and all that crap
that he makes me spend way too much
money on I mean what light diffusers
wasted light is what I call it and this
is the flag cart this is funny we have
to see stand carts because our carpenter
accidentally built two of these instead
of one so now we have an extra we're
still not sure I could hang on there you
go this is Brandon's special place yeah
so he has been asking me for a dedicated
place to shoot b roll of products since
he started two years ago originally my
solution was Luke's workbench back in
the garage days and then our second
solution was front room with like the
shells in the wall and Neverland there
was no space this is big enough that
we'll be able to take big items like
computer cases or 3d printers and we'll
be able to install a gym the filming
guys probably know what that is but
basically it's a big long arm with a
camera at the end of it if you like
like crazy shots with it so Brandon
actually has his new gym ordered it is
here and he is ready to start playing
around a little bit as soon as I know
exactly he's meeting this one Allina
sebastian custom walk oh that thing no
ever seen you on the box yeah yeah yeah
give me the box there you go the kind of
box alright okay so I'm gonna actually
going to switch sides on you guys not
quite done yet this is the super-fun
shelf so pretty much everything you've
seen on channel one is here there's also
some just kind of sentimental value
relics this keyboard reminds me of the
time that I was more angry at Brandon
than any other time in the history of
our while almost three-year relationship
now I told him for this shoot I needed a
metal reinforced keyboard I gave him
weeks to come up with a solution the
night before our shoot at about 8:00
p.m. he brings me a spray-painted
keyboard I say where's the metal
reinforcement you have the metal
reinforcement right he goes no it's
painted like metallic silver I go are
you kidding me the script
specifically calls it's been approved by
the client it's been it's good old mer
metal reinforced keyboard we don't have
one I gave you weeks weeks to do this so
I went to princess auto I obtained I
forget what it was I don't even know
what this is and so I use my angle
grinder to score it bent it and we had
our metal reinforced keyboard but I
don't remember where I'm going with the
story there's some sentimental value
stuff here so there's our channel
Superfund 100,000 subscriber plaque from
YouTube we've actually got all three of
the silver plaques here okay so this
over here is going to be - is special
quarter the 1 million subscriber plaque
so they're really big it turns out I did
not know that I don't know where YouTube
expects people to put these things on
the wall
yeah on the wall that's just
we got we got a joker on the tour this
time you got a smart guy but yes we'll
put humble so yeah this is where I'm
gonna work on stuff whatever it doesn't
come in my office which may happen from
time to time okay so this is a server
room so up here this is a forty thousand
dollar piece of equipment from Telus we
don't pay for that
it's just leased to us so that's for our
dedicated fiber line this is our router
for or tension fiber lines although
we're going to be operating this on
sometime early next week
these are switches gigabit 10 gig for
all the editing workstations this is our
surveillance server and dedicated switch
for that UPS for that this is our 24 Bay
SSD storage server for video editing it
can do it on 10 gigabytes per second of
sequential reads and sequential writes
so this is where legitimately pretty
much all of the magic happens this is
the editing gun so all these
workstations are pretty much
state-of-the-art 49 60 X 6 quarters 32
gigs of ram except eddie special again
64 gigs for some reason we ended up
actually using the capabilities of the
tied max by accident so our new editing
workflow has us converting everything to
a codec called sinha form before editing
so what that enables people to do is
when they're scrubbing through the video
editing timeline
it's near-instantaneous really cool
turns out that it's GPU accelerating so
everyone's got more up desks everyone's
got new peripherals everyone's got a
microphone on their station now for
doing things like you know goofy
voiceover while they're editing and
stuff like that 4k monitors courtesy of
an LG can't say enough about these guys
they actually provided 12 of them
awesome last thing is upstairs this is
our old janky green screen this is what
we've been using in the meantime while
pizza okay so basically be buddy baked
it from her old place I don't know if
any of you with a folder on social media
but that's how it went down we were
operating a business out of a
residential property in the city tower
Township of Langley booted us the crap
out so we actually had to move into this
place before our final inspection was
done and before all the construction was
done
so behind the curtains um if you guys
care this is what makes the whole place
tick actually so this is where our sales
team sits none of this happens without
the the hard work and dedication few
people who want to get on the phone with
Squarespace or Dollar Shave Club or
whoever else and make sure that all of
this actually gets paid for all the
salaries of the people who work very
hard here get paid so this is where Nick
sits and this is actually our newest
member of the team Colton something
really cool happened quite some time ago
a lot of people don't understand like
how time-consuming and how expensive it
is all I'll come out there for this how
time-consuming and how expensive it is
to make video well quality yeah how
time-consuming and expensive it is to
start a team around you to make video
let's get a look at this but the
important thing to notice on this graph
is this is views per day okay so I'll
show everyone is that there's a trend
here it's your classic hockey stick
actually this this so what happened was
I hired Nick light that day um it
allowed me to spend my time making
better videos it allowed me to work more
closely with the video making team to
help us grow the actual viewership and
then that allowed me to not think about
money so that's that's why we have so
many sponsorship spots and why we do
what we do it's not because I just want
to you know sit and relax all day
because there's a lot of one-man shows
on YouTube that that do great it's just
because for me to do what I do best
I need fewer distractions I didn't want
to think about money anymore so this is
the conference room it's got bench
seating so the table goes kind of here
also making storage
come on guys you got to give me the
reaction okay my office is to the left
and then that pretty much complete the
tour right now full of random people
like I said is all very temporary
there's our bunch ever in there with
Sony fs700 now I say cameras aren't
expensive I meant in the context of
running a business I didn't either not
expensive that puppy is worth about 12
grand with all the accessories attached
to it that's I think the single most
expensive piece of equipment we've ever
bought and was the first thing that I
bought as a new company we it has been
upgraded either through firmware or
through third party accessories to shoot
4k 60fps and it can do sustained 1080p
slow-mo at 240 frames per second so that
camera has actually grown in capability
as we have grown as a company it's a
huge workhorse I'd really enjoy that
camera we be heart that camera so very
much a lot of other things Sony dad is
not a big fan I'm glad we investment any
- indoors something that the building
inspector
system that we have instead of a fire
pole okay
good news about it is that if we were to
slice off all of these guards
we could probably repurpose it as a fire
poles okay so I'm going to take my group
through oh wow the tourists are oh my
goodness okay I know the lineup for
tours is bananas right now so as a
consolation prize we are going to be
doing a live unboxing here in the
parking lot you're not used to being
filmed are you yeah actually when you're
doing the filming lots of it you know I
gotta see money I've seen luck you're
good I can about like thank you I'm
getting old my hair is pretty please
give me five minutes
in five minutes I will return to this
spot okay so guys I just ate of the year
it's hard being the boss
all right
what am i doing right now right I'm
awesome yes yes it is a core i7 6700 Sun
urine - face almost have everybody there
you go in a branded we're the same
height I know this
of the dark so going
hi figuratively and literally because
it's very sunny outside and as you can
see we've emptied out quite a bit of our
stuff
and I am hot right you big fight on that
dick but no that's not something I would
do if you can I just put the hashtag
full sign this you got to put your faces
on the top of the frame oh yeah like
that see there you go yeah that's how
