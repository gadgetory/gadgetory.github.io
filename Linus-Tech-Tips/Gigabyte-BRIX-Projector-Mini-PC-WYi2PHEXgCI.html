delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more welcome to a video about one of the
most bizarre products that I've
encountered in quite some time the
gigabyte brick series in general uses
the low power consumption and heat
output of fourth generation Intel Core
series processors to achieve a
stunningly tiny form factor without
compromising performance to nearly the
extent we would have seen in the past
they've got everything from extremely
slim bricks to the big fat bricks max
that could accept for two and a half
inch hard drives to bricks Pro which can
be outfitted with intel iris pro
graphics to deliver a pretty darn
satisfying gameplay experience at 720p
in modern games making it kind of
perfect as a home theater PC that can
handle some light gaming or as a steam
machine but today we don't have any of
those bricks we have the Brix projector
which uses a similar sized chassis to
the Brix pro but instead of using that
extra space for powerful hardware and
the beefy heatsink it actually crams a
90 lumen LED backlit WVGA that's 854 by
480 projector with 1.4 watt stereo
speakers inside the casing so let's take
a quick tour of the device on the front
we've got two USB 3 ports and a
headphone or optical audio out jack as
well as the lens for the projector on
the sides not a whole lot other than the
speaker grills and an intake ventilation
hole for the projector component that
lives inside the top of the unit then at
the back we find the main affair in
terms of i/o with HDMI out mini
DisplayPort out Gigabit Ethernet 2 more
USB 3 port power in a Kensington lock
and finally a discreet input for the
projector itself that's mini HDMI giving
it the flexibility to allow it to be
used with any other device that supports
HDMI such as a notebook or like a PC
within a boardroom or something like
that
gigabyte conveniently includes an HD
my two mini HDMI cables since most
people won't have one of those lying
around which i think is a nice little
inclusion all right thanks for watching
guys I think ah gotcha now we're not
done yet let's crack this baby open
removing the four screws from the bottom
and using the little handle we can pull
off the bottom then remove one more
screw to completely open up the brick's
projector the 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
Core i3 for t10 you processor with its
HD 4400 graphics is soldered so we won't
be changing that but once we're inside
we can upgrade the included n Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth 4.0 mini PCIe module and we
can add up to 16 gigs of ddr3 l sodium
memory and an M SATA SSD it should be
noted that this is a bare-bones unit so
RAM and storage are not included by
default the internal guts also give us a
look at how this bad boy is being cooled
the projector lamp is cooled by that
fresh air intake that I showed you guys
on the side with a copper heatsink
attached by thermal pads then the air
exhausted from that heatsink goes
directly into the intake for the CPU
cooler which has a larger fan on it that
uses a blower design to pump the air
through a shrouded aluminum heat thing
then right out of the chassis everything
else inside is passively cooled alright
so back to the outside the integrated
projector it's really nothing special
it's got no Keystone adjustments or
other projector like settings so you
just have to fuss with it to get the
image right and without a very dark room
you aren't going to be getting a usable
image much bigger than 35 to the low 40s
in terms of diagonal inch sizes but it
should be noted that a sirs entry-level
pico projector the C 120 is 200 bucks
and that gets you 10 extra lumens but is
otherwise pretty much the same in terms
of raw spec if you really want to get
something better in a compact projector
you're probably looking at something
more like a GP series from BenQ those
perform much better but they're around
500 dollars so while the Brix series is
supposed to sell based on compactness in
general gigabyte has a model that is
available for 250 dollars less than this
one with exact
actly the same specs as this one that's
half the size of this one but does not
include the projector so the big selling
point for this particular Brix is
obviously the versatility of it it could
live in an office boardroom and save the
hassle of having a separate projector or
operate as a PC in a dorm with a normal
monitor hooked up most of the time via
those normal outputs but with the
ability to chuck it on the included
little bendy tripod which is a $5 value
you can get them for five bucks and then
point it at the wall with the lights off
when you want to watch a movie or
something like that so with that in mind
I would love to see you guys comment on
this video and let me know what you
would use a mini PC with a built-in
projector for or tell me if you think
it's crazy and you wouldn't use the
thing at all guys like and share this
