product for my unboxing it's oh yeah you
can't really tell what it is from that
side in fact you can't really tell what
it is from many sides but Bam's ocz okay
so this is an SSD mounting adapter now I
actually did an unboxing of of a
silverstone adapter that's pretty cool
because it holds two SSDs in one adapter
but this one is a little bit different
and the reason that they've gone with a
different approach is that this SSD
adapter is designed to allow the ports
on your SSD to line up with where
they're supposed to be say for example
if your case has has Drive rails that
have like a backplane and you need to be
able to slide them in and have the ports
actually line up so that it'll so that
it'll plug in like if you're not using
conventional cables or something like
that which is why I actually bought this
okay so in terms of accessories it
doesn't come with a whole lot
it comes with one set of screws to screw
the drive into the adapter plate which
is here and then it comes with another
set of screws to mount the adapter plate
into your case using any of the
conventional three and a half inch drive
mounting holes which are conveniently
located here now I kind of wish I had an
SSD on me but you're gonna have to kind
of visualize here with me so basically
the SSD is mounted to this drive plate
using the four screws screw holes here
so you use the bottom mount on the SSD
and then from there you can actually
mount it to your case using the three
holes that are along the sides so that's
a pretty straightforward thing and I
just thought since I have it anyway I
might as long box it thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the OCZ
two-and-a-half inch to three and a half
inch drive adapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
