the wine show when show that is or the
the naam the NA show na na
what news and analysis weekly news
analysis weekly baby it actually totally
works
na it kind of does that's a double yeah
that wins yeah yeah all right Wade show
welcome to it we're doing some news
stuff there's the GP P is no longer a
thing news which I'm sure every single
person in the tech community is gonna be
talking about a lot
boom because there's not a ton else
going on so you know wolf we'll take
whatever we can feels like a win to but
who actually knows we're gonna get into
that also t-mobile and Sprint are trying
to China to become one again hug each
other a little bit more than they did in
the past you know they tried it before
yeah I'll try it again yeah also D Ram
price-fixing we've all kind of known
it's been kind of ridiculous for a while
it's weird
how expensive this stuff is so weird
you're pricing out a computer and they
be like whoa that was unexpected anyways
I'm looking at the analytics lately it's
bad it's bad yeah that plus Facebook
stuff yeah all that more on the NA show
of an option I'm chomping at the bit
here who thought of that clenched thing
I don't know area originally we're gonna
have a new one of these like every week
and then I think we've made one which
ones you cuz I used to always wear that
same sweater the shorter one in the same
shirt looks Thank You PIAA yeah I
appreciate your stuff yeah Squarespace
thank you very much my hair changes
depending on the season what season are
you a redhead weird oh my that would be
great jinda be it we're gonna start off
the show with a folding and Boyd
community showed out we have one of
those things wrong yeah I didn't even
know what
oh I had no idea I got hurt I've heard
of distributed oh I thought you just
didn't know what our team was I had no
idea what the folding thing was I got a
message from one of the members of the
our folding team was like give us a
shout out and I was like what are you
what is polluting slash boink what and
then I was checking it out I was like oh
this is amazing I want to do this I
think I might set it up yeah so we have
a community on the forum dedicated
folding in boink folding and butt
boink is more like point can be a lot of
things I know what that is
it's Friday baby falling at home is a
distributed computing project for
Disease Research that simulates protein
folding which is why it's called folding
at home because your folding proteins
digitally at home and computational drug
design and other types of molecular
dynamics it's this really cool thing and
boink can do stuff similar to that or
sorta not and this kind of research
takes a lot of computing power so that's
why it's distributed so you can help out
and actually chip away at cancer
research or Alzheimer's research just by
using your spare compute cycles on your
piece-of-crap PC that's in your storage
room like I planned to do or you know
those mining machines
you could you could repurpose those to
help in cancer if you wanted to or you
could not you know whatever whatever
folds your boat there are foldable both
sensible chuckles you plate a boat and
then you fold it into the shape of a
protein anyways moving on to light a
second these guys alright these people
on the folding team yes you can do this
at any point right like you can turn on
you can yeah but they also do these like
like bursts yeah these weeks where they
all try really hard to to devote as much
of their computing power as they can to
do and sometimes it'll be like a
competition kind of set up where there's
like leaderboards for what different
teams are doing yeah yeah so though
they'll be like oh like who can make the
most of this week or whatever and we're
like in the top twenty all right we do
we do pretty good and I have contribute
nothing to this let's get it let's get
it speaking of getting something no
longer are you going to get
NVIDIA GP I thought you'd get screwed by
Mike you might still get screwed by GBP
okay so just to catch up the people who
don't know the nvidia geforce partner
program was it was basically like if
you're a partner of nvidia like you're a
oh no this guy what are your thoughts
quick for you you want victory is ours
you're behind the mike
congratulations are in order
we did we did win but again back to what
it actually is in case you didn't know
yeah yeah have you read they're they're
terrible
yeah yeah anyways he doesn't get to talk
about it we do so continue haha let's
say you are asus and you're you sign up
for the nvidia ki PP if if you wanted to
sell an nvidia graphics card with your
special like rog branding cuz you're
aces yeah you couldn't sell any other
graphics cards with that branding i
don't think that the it stipulates that
like hey your existing branding rog
you've got to use that for nvidia i
think it's up to a Zeus to decide what
branding they use in theory they could
have been like you know what india we're
gonna use our awesome rog browning on
the Radeon cards and we're gonna make
new branding for you that would so from
a company's perspective though that
would generally be bad because the
majority of the market is Nvidia
purchasers exactly want to use your
stronger brand for that because you'll
make more money
exactly so they're totally cutting out
and this mindshare really matters right
because what they're forcing and what
did actually occur when this program
rolled out yes you've got to make new
product lines new you've got a fork your
branding basically and so they made Ares
the this comes out a considerable
expense by the way oh yeah they've got a
branding marketing they've got a design
it they've got a iterate on that then
they've got to actually print boxes get
these boxes in the shelves and
presumably at this point these companies
have already done all of that so now
that the partner program is cancelled
everybody's wondering if Ares is going
to continue to be a thing or if they're
just gonna switch back
the one hand they have this sunk cost on
the other hand that brand means nothing
to anybody yet yeah so it's better to
lean on your existing brand what we
don't know is if NVIDIA has remunerated
these companies like let's say you sunk
billion our millions on rebranding or at
least hundreds of thousands is Nvidia
like did the lawyer set up anything for
this particular case we're in videos
anything okay so you guys probably
didn't hear that what happened was it
that teleprompter glass I would go help
him are you all right
dennis is dead everyone so a glass fell
and shattered into a lot of pieces as we
were able to hear from here I guess yeah
you guys definitely can hear that we
just heard shattering and then Dennis
going oh oh yeah I was very audible yeah
anyway sorry we're gonna continue here
but yeah it's it's unclear at this time
whether brands are going to survive not
not as in like whether Isis will survive
but it's unclear whether or not Ares
will survive whether or not Nvidia will
be compensating these brands for the
work that they did related to GPP I
didn't be like who knows how accurate it
was leaks that we got I didn't see any
provisions for that because I don't
think in video was expecting to have to
pull back out but I guess we didn't see
the other side of the agreement either
well it would have been what those
particular companies lawyers came up
with exactly what the other side
wouldn't be in the original TOS another
interesting thing was how they framed
the their cancellation so we learned
about it through a blog post that in
video yeah and they did not they didn't
like Facebook it
they didn't go on an apology tour they
didn't own what they did no instead
they're like they framed it thusly you
know there's all these rumors and
conjecture and myths mistruths around
about the nvidia GP so rather than
spending our energy m'god leaning any of
battling misinformation we're just gonna
cancel the program so we can focus on
what's important like billing the new
technology like as if the GP p and all
the backlash was like draining their
resources
all the technical people at India were
quick working on marketing
yeah like the engineers really I got
focused cuz everyone hates us PR
nightmare this is so brutal
yeah it's that that part is so brutal
because a lot of the reason why this is
all come to light was because of people
named right now but from the the guy
from hard OCP that that like pushed all
this kind of stuff and the rest of the
media not just us at all we we probably
had a relatively small involvement
because I think we just talked about it
during when there's other creator sort
of made dedicated videos and all this
kind of stuff when when all the NA show
yeah a lot of confusion around the name
but there's been a Radeon graphics each
each each week we have half an hour for
weigh in half an hour from no sorry yeah
so it's just all this stuff was brought
to light there was basically nothing
from Nvidia explaining what was going on
they're complaining of getting all the
rumors conjecture mistruths go far
beyond its intent well maybe better
explain its intent I know there was one
post talking about it but it was so
whimsical and didn't properly go through
what's actually happened yes total BS
they keep focusing on the fact that this
is all about transparency for the
consumer so the consumer knows what
they're buying they know that they're
getting an Nvidia card and that's the
best thing you can get they want to make
sure and it's very obvious and
transparent on the packaging that that's
what they're getting if that's what it's
about then why even rely on these other
brands like ROG why don't you just
stipulate that they have a big fat green
banner that says in video on it if it's
really just about branding they kind of
do like I've never I've heard a lot of
complaints from new system builders I've
helped a lot of people get into building
the computers and one of my big things
when I would help friends or family or
whoever build a computer was always that
I'll be there is like the guiding hand
but I want them to do it I want them to
pick the parts I would want them to
build the computer but I could help them
with anything and answer whatever
questions et cetera setting snacks yeah
getting free pop because
they would supply supplies for the
regular chips and pop that I'm in there
will be two crummy to help you I was one
buddy of mine that I've built two
computers for and every time we do he
brings a case of vanilla coke mmm I like
this deal it's worked out quite well but
it's I've never had a single person be
like I don't understand I'm buying ROG
why is it a AMD thing or whatever like
I've never had that confusion everyone
seems to get it
so all this hubbub over that seems
unlikely it feels like they just wanted
to muscle them out of the good brands
yeah exactly they know that their market
position is such that they're gonna be
the ones awarded the ROG the incumbent
existing branding and that AMD is gonna
be the one suffering under the new
branding so nice try NVIDIA yeah some
Evan 33 is is spamming contrast in the
chat so much that I'm super surprised
that he's not banned from the chat by
the bots yet I don't know if he's
talking about contrast in terms of like
what this picture look looks like or if
he's talking about between the boxes but
in my experience it's pretty it's this
probably isn't even what he's talking
about but in my experience it's pretty
easy to differentiate between which one
is an nvidia card which one is an AMD
card he's definitely talking with the
visuals of this we don't care yeah man
we're gonna make it about graphics cards
it's an attentional dude this is the new
style yeah low or high contrast or
whatever the opposite of whatever you're
complaining about we don't understand it
but whatever so yeah I'm not like and I
know that a lot of people are in vidya
and I'm sure they're paying attention to
a lot of the press stuff around this so
they might see this section of the show
at some point in time guys you got to
figure out your public communication you
make great graphics cards you have the
market share the giant market share that
no you're very happy about that but
people are kind of pissed off and I know
it's very easy for the community I know
you guys know this it's very easy for
the community to go after the company
that has the Lions market share the
lion's share of the market it's it's
very easy for that to happen
definitely a non insignificant amount of
what's going on but especially around
GPP the communication was bad you have
to understand that communication was bad
and this didn't help with everyone
needing to dive in and dig and glean and
fight for every little tiny bit of
information that they could and for you
to come back at it by saying oh yeah
there's so many rumors conjecture
mistruths are going around everywhere
clarify better that's on you man and I
know like it got leaked or whatever and
that sucks as a company I completely
understand that that's super frustrating
but at that point in time throwing at
other people for that is not gonna help
you to try to win everyone else onto
your side you need to be open to the
community and try to explain what was
going on in a not so whimsical and were
just fairies on the breeze kind of way
because that's obviously know what's
going on give me your opinion on this
part a lot of people think that them
canceling the program doesn't really
amount to much because the damage is
already done
there's some some there's some costs
there's these new brands what it could
be back like back alley or what do you
call them back of the deals back end
deals back end back end the deals could
continue to exist right now just not
public can even name it something else
whatever you because a lot of these big
players they sign these agreements so
they might just carry forward with them
yeah we'll have to will have to see how
it goes well we'll have to pay close
attention to Ares I guess specifically
see what Isis does with that maybe see
how Isis communicates or around it I
just yeah this line of communication was
very in my opinion sassy seriously
though it was sassy and it was just it
was not what are you talking about their
blog post capitulation blog post yeah no
sassy yeah and it's it's like yes the
community wanted GBP to be Paul
but I think even more than that at the
core I think people wanted to know what
the heck was going on and I don't think
anyone got that because now it's just
gone and we still don't even really know
what it like actually was what the
actual rules were were being told that
everything that we knew was rumors
conjecture mistruths so we didn't know
anything then so what's the truth we
still don't know they're saying like oh
it was just to like make things more
clear okay but we need more like we have
a someone showing us like basically a
contract in very clear terms and then
you're being like everyone's just
supposed to be happy yeah and by the way
thank you or even that in no way makes
it more clear for everybody that makes
it way way way harder to go by a
graphics card if I rock up and there's
like okay there's gaming there's Oris
there's rog there's all that times two
for each different one that's way harder
that's way harder to figure out the tier
of the graphics card I guess none of
those words like really mean anything
no yeah be way better if they if I think
it'd be better a better business case
for them just to say hey a giant banner
that says nvidia gtx 1070 well okay
that's people want right let's I'm gonna
get to the page first but let's go to
amazon.com no that's good in a new bag
I switched because of like Purchase
History and related items and stuff did
you get a beanie Vick don't worry about
it boy let's go to Luke's screen what is
that now spoil okay in video search you
don't even see boxes
[Laughter]
well I mean the name already has and
like everything has GeForce init GeForce
GTX the branding is there so that's like
the text equivalent of the like put the
banner yeah that's right at the
beginning of all of them well that's
another point as as to why this GP
didn't even need to exist because it's
already it's already in the name so I
don't buy this whole transparency angle
yeah I don't buy it I wish they would
just own it hey we try to make a lot of
money we try to make more money we got
caught it wasn't you can even be like we
thought this was a good idea clearly
everyone didn't work in a bit yeah I was
like that means do that yeah you should
have shut down all your stores for an
afternoon it has some kind of training
for all your employees oh man okay
anyways I think we've beat this topic
down and left it in a ditch so we can
move on to the t-mobile / Sprint merger
so you know more about this than I do
but they've tried to do this before I
know nothing uh I know was it the FTC
that blocked it in the past yeah is it
all FTC's FTC stuff so I believe the FTC
was like we think there's room for four
players so no yes that's correct so that
would have been under the Obama
administration I mean they thought okay
there's the market in the US could
support four major cellular provider
services or companies so they thought
more is better so it's more competition
so we're not gonna let you guys merge
that was then things have changed not
only is it just a change of
administration and they think that the
Trump administration would be more
favorable to this murder I thought of it
has to do with 5g actually and the u.s.
ended and the administration is very
serious about 5g yeah remember that it
was the Trump like I don't know I want
to say util unilaterally but he did that
little sick we should have one more
little signature thingy to say that
Broadcom and Qualcomm shouldn't merge
right and there's like rationale for
that because like Qualcomm is
instrumental in advancing 5g
there's a big global race to be the
country that pioneers 5g the most right
now and China and South Korea are
winning and the US wants to win because
you get lots of benefits from pioneering
the technology in the standards lots of
job creation IP it was really good for
the u.s. to have developed 4G and they
want to keep that going and there I
think that with this the new merged
company will have a greater ability to
pioneer 5g it's a it's I think there's
an opportunity for t-mobile and Sprint
to make a really cool name when they
merge mobile sprint that's a little
motion here but they're just gonna be
called t-mobile still miss top ok missed
opportunity so they're merging but
essentially t-mobile is taking over
spring is that kind of a deal I know
they're just being called t-mobile I
don't think the name like I don't
necessarily think just because the name
is still t-mobile that indicates that
they're the big winners but I don't know
maybe I think public eye it might come
across that way even if it's not
actually that way is it everyone's
calling it t-mobile now well I don't
know enough about it I can't well it's
they're not they've just said that
they're committed to merging they plan
to merge but it's not up to them they
still have to the courts still need to
approve this yeah and that's gonna take
a couple months I think even though I'm
not from the states I generally like
t-mobile
I've liked how they've done a lot of
their campaigns I like the kind of moves
that they've done in the market over the
last while so it sounds clears a
theoretical question every good
capitalist likes competition right yeah
my question is does more players mean
more competition not necessary because
right now you've got for t-mobile and
Sprint our numbers three and four
they're way smaller than AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon should they merge they'll be
about the same size so do do you think
they actually have more of an ability is
there more competition when there's
three equally sized sized players then I
kind of think probably maybe because I
think where the market probably needs
more competition is with the big guys so
I would rather there be a fight between
three big
and please no less than three because we
have enough of that problem in our in
our own space with AMD and Intel and AMD
and NVIDIA but so please no less than
three but I like the idea of taking
three and four and making them an actual
real yeah exactly against the other two
big guys that seems like a good idea to
me and even if you can make a fourth as
long as all four the same kind of size
when you have four and you have to kind
of smaller ones and two kind of bigger
ones there is good competition there
because there is competition for the
smaller markets and competition for the
bigger markets but I don't feel like
t-mobile and Sprint are gonna abandon
their places sure so I think it'll be
okay I don't have more funds to move up
market though yeah speaking of collusion
cuz uh three player oligopolies suck
DRAM price-fixing yeah good call so the
law firm Hagens Berman has filed a class
action lawsuit against Samsung micron
and hynek's I love how every law firm is
so obviously a law firm just by the name
I wish that was one person's full name
awesome
- there's a lot of people with two first
names but not enough of two last names
so according to the firm's investigation
the three DRAM manufacturers conspired
to limit the supply of DRAM chips
between 2016 and 2017 with the purpose
of course of inflating their prices and
we've all seen that happen DRM saw a
forty seven percent price increased
during 2017 the largest jump ever in the
last thirty years and probably ever
because before thirty years ago did you
probably had a B and C RAM but like oh
yeah ancient stuff so the complaint has
been put forward on behalf of anyone who
in the u.s. purchased something
containing DRM from one of these three
companies from July 1st 2016 through
February 1st 2018 the suit claims that
after a global decline in the price of
RAM chips the three companies began in
June of 2016 to deliberately limit their
output of
DRM storage chips but did they have to
if they're okay if they're colluding and
they want the prices to go up and set it
down did they have to do it so hard I
mean it's kind of like yeah well because
pre previously shown obvious that's that
yeah you think you try to be slightly
subtle let's just get them to climb
gradually but depending on the detail
then I want like four hundred new cars
well okay it's critical a lot they're
also even trying to get away with it and
maybe what it takes to get away with it
is to be like we literally don't have
the capacity to make more so then they
had to not build a factory and then they
don't have this Factory or they have the
a lot of us who they're processed note
you have to so because they're not
scaling how they should and they're like
publicly saying to each other that
they're not going to go for scale
they're gonna go for price per item and
whatnot well I hope they get found
guilty they'll be interesting that would
be pretty well to be more interesting to
me be kind of fun if you if you could
charge someone guilty for like you're
jerks at running a company oh yeah be
like you only really have the money to
build another factory there's clearly
the market to build another factory
you're not doing it just because you
want to be whatever and charge an insane
amount of money per chip so you guys
suck here's a fine yeah this is kind of
where capitalism breaks down where it's
like yeah theory if they're doing that
then there should be room for them for a
new entrant in the market but the
barriers to entry are so damn so
insanely high the investments so large
and the talent pool is not big enough
that yeah they own it
so oligopoly I wouldn't be surprised if
these guys were caught it like actually
guilty because from 1998 to 2002 hynix
Samsung and micron were among a group of
vendors who would ultimately end up
paying a settlement to end complaints
that they conspired to rigged the price
of DRAM chips so that's not even the
first time this happened all so yeah
thank you twitch chat for pointing out
the resolution problem I don't know what
was going on there I had it set to
default resolution and it must have been
on like 64 by 64 not actually but it was
pretty freakin bad so I changed it and
we seem to be good now as I put it that
way actually cuz I have
is it thanks Luke yeah get owned now it
is there for the world see no it was the
the resolution of this screen ah so it
didn't even have anything to they can
already see my sense yeah yeah it's okay
air for the world to see speaking of for
the world to see let's do sponsor spots
sponsor sponsor yes get money for the
world not to see your private in for
infinite your your private Internet
access information that nation oh and I
mentioned that your private information
but I tripped like 18 times trying to
get there but anyways P ia if you need a
VPN like my dad did to access his own
web site at school that was pretty
insane with the IPOP hell both ways yeah
okay he's a he's a instructor and the IT
department at school had no idea why he
couldn't access the website mmm so I was
like just you know do that thing and it
worked what's his website can we all go
to it right now
that'll probably bring it down but
Luke's dad calm yeah let's not I'm
actually not gonna tell the domain name
because I actually I'm gonna go to
Luke's dad calm just this is their
website they've probably owned but not
you might want a VPN behind okay yes
someone's gonna own that it's parked for
free courtesy of GoDaddy it's gonna take
almost no time until that's going yeah
your dad's watching this and he's
probably buying up right out anyways you
can connect up to five devices on to
your P ia account at a time they have
apps for for Android and iOS if you need
it there's apps for Windows Mac OS
literally the notes on here say Linus
but I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be
Linux but that's that's wonderful and
Google Chrome so you can have a plug-in
specifically for it so you don't have to
have the app installed on the computer
if you want it's kind of easy to do it
that way it has an internet kill switch
that will block all traffic if they beat
if the VPN becomes disconnected
unexpectedly that's quite cool not all
VPNs have that so if your VPN
disconnects for whatever reason
and starts flowing and yeah yeah not VPN
and that's not super great that's such a
fail check it out today at the link
that's like below here if you're on
twitch I guess just type that out it's
not that complicated or if you are on
YouTube or SoundCloud
I guess does that anyone listen some
people do in the description of this
thing whether it's an audio thing or a
video thing we'll have a link to PIAA
check it out it's awesome it's great it
does good things and speaking of things
that are awesome great and do good
things fresh books but if you're if
you're trying to run a company and you
need to invoice people for whatever
reason you can do that super fast super
simple no big deal invoices to your
customer you can check to see if they
have seen that set invoice so you can
bug them about it and that green you can
collect your money you can also do
expenses through the app which is super
cool it keeps track of who owes you what
it keeps track of how much you've spent
on different things which is really cool
we used it in a scrapyard horse and it
was actually quite helpful if you have
any questions you can reach out to an
actual person there's no escalations
there's no return calls they just pick
up and solve your problem there isn't
even a phone tree you're just like hey
what's up I need help and they're like
yeah I got you no problem it's pretty
simple I have I'm sure that's exactly
how they do it and next up we have
Squarespace Squarespace is a website
that you use to make other websites it's
it's like website ception it's wonderful
it has a replicator it's twelve bucks a
month if you subscribed for a year you
get a domain with it because that kind
of makes sense so you can go to one
place get a domain and a website you can
build your website really easily even if
you have no idea of what building a
website even means you can do it no
problem on Squarespace because they give
you this like beautiful template you
just put in like words and pictures and
it's like oh if you think building sorry
you're not gonna sweat there's no manual
labor yeah no I mean it's manual in the
sense that you need to use your hands
you need to type and click that might be
semi problematic you use a voice yeah
do clicking things some other way like
echolocate your computer well ok sir is
the most control with your mouth whoa
yeah for if you're like partially
disabled in someone you can scroll the
tongue I'm not sure how it work in
middle-click there was a kid in my
school and he showed me how his worked
and it was actually really cool but that
was a long time ago and I'm sure it's
advanced since then so yeah anyways you
can use offer code alt get a
squarespace.com /l TT and use offer code
L DT to get 10% off your first purchase
so you have a website and domain and all
that fun stuff
what if someone followed your advice
right then went to Squarespace and the
free domain they got was Luke's dad calm
and they made all of this tonight do it
you could that's kind of the cool thing
it's so fast you could actually have it
done for tonight Oh usually it was
pretty neato and then I don't have a
lower banner for this but also check out
LTX 2018 at LTX expo calm and I realize
that the X in LT X stands for expo and
then we also say Expo so just don't
worry about that too much
LT X Expo Calm check it out no it means
exploration like SpaceX Oh Linus tech
exploration explorers come and explore
so it's gonna be you'll it this year I
got some things up my sleeve oh my I'm
just gonna be there I guess getting to
be Bonanza not not too crazy
also check out float plane that's like
what I do and stuff it's pretty cool I
like it it's it's like neato and slow
plane I'm gonna get us logged in so we
can see what's going on - dude - dude
you hold on there we go
we have like creators Oh wrong one we
have creators on the platform and stuff
so you can check out - tech tips who's
apparently uploaded a whole bunch of
videos including keyboard history good
job anyway
who did that one who did that one I
didn't call my video that what
that well that--okay history of the
computer keyboard is that a tech quickie
who works yeah that might be a tech wiki
maybe we'll see not now though there's
also other stuff online SEC tips there's
stuff from bit wit ultra if you
subscribe to him there's stuff from tech
deals if you subscribe to them it's cool
it's a platform that has different
people that you can subscribe to see
their videos
that's a try it's a tech cookie nice we
have we have a con from Angie Dennis and
you can watch their videos in glorious
really high bitrate and really nice
sound quality and a private nice little
comment section so you don't have to
deal with the drivel that's on you yeah
and it has a thumbs down button it does
so you can be like in the comments your
dumb other humans get used to it the
real world virtually don't say this out
loud but look at that I'm gonna buy that
I love that I'm gonna make it into
something cool you know you know one of
my favorite domains that we have that we
have to do something with but we don't
know what yet adequate video service
calm about using it for like our
back-end or something but yeah just a
funny funny little joke don't worry
about too much use that for April Fool's
maybe that'll be funny like redirecting
the whole thing warranty void stickers
we have an update that's exciting
I've been excited by this for a little
while I'm you know I think I was on your
last time we talked about it like two or
three weeks ago that we talked about and
at the time one quick thing someone
asked is there a full plate free trial
there will be there isn't yet mmm we're
currently in like still like an alpha II
kind of stage so once we properly
release there will be the day there's
the free trials the day I use it for the
first time that's not true I'm just on
there today I was like you have to so
okay per US law no warranty or product
sold for over five bucks can put any
restrictions on repairs who does the
repairing you can't have a sticker on
your product that says if you break this
sticker or your void you you're going to
use ward
happened last time one of us said you're
going to use ward last time anyway it's
still true today your pointy will be
Ward you use a third-party repair
service at least that's what they say
but that's actually illegal in the US
and what we learned last time when the
news broke is that is it the FTC they
issued yes it is
they issued letters to six big companies
we didn't know who the companies were
but they they were like look guys you
know this has been illegal since the 70s
we're about to crack the whip crack down
on it yeah and guess what now we know
who those companies were Hinduism Luke
Sony Microsoft Nintendo Wow
what competition it's like all the
console people it's interesting also I
don't understand the $5 thing why are
you allowed to put restrictions on
repairs for things under $5 so we think
it's um it's probably a bundle like this
one sentence that we're clause that were
focused on in the context of this
article is a part of a larger bundle and
to attribute that whole bundle to items
that are cheaper than five bucks would
just be too much work and it would
probably like inhibit people from
starting
cheapy little businesses okay sure
that's my speculation why not it's just
such a weird like what's even under five
dollars that you would take to a repair
shop
hey just there grease that puppy out of
this doesn't spam or a quarter turns all
I get and say this needs some wd-40 but
I don't want to spray it on myself
[Laughter]
that's about into that story honestly
yeah the companies have 30 days to
revise there's been online you can see a
kind of a more generic version of the
letter but each company did receive a
customized tailored letter specifically
outlining the praat the offending
product so in the case of Microsoft it
was the Xbox consoles that had these
these stickers on them and they're not
just it's not just what repairs it also
says something about third party
like accessories as well Oh interesting
yes it's it's Microsoft's actually get a
pretty good spot for that because while
their surface notebooks have like
notoriously been terrifying to try to
work on because like the Terra Cotta and
like all this other kind of stuff
the Xbox one X you're talking about
you're talking when you said Terra Cotta
you're talking with that like yeah well
something air cotta is like that's way
that's yeah okay so what is that called
I don't know I think it's a terrorist
something it has a weird name what is it
Alcantara there we go Alcantara yeah
yeah thank you now that people are cars
can stop so you ever gonna listen to a
podcast while you're driving you're just
like yeah so is that is that is that
what the like the soldiers are made out
of the like huge amount of Terracotta
Army yeah ah yeah yes so that's where I
played too much Civ apparently um
anyways where am I going with this the
Xbox one X is actually kind of
wonderfully easy to take apart and put
back together
terracotta yeah it's a type of
earthenware where you're wet where your
earthenware yeah yeah you're who knows
where all right that's where the show is
going so yeah this this is good I'm very
happy about this we'll have to see what
actually comes of it hopefully it means
that my switch is still good to go even
though I have turned it into a purple
thing instead of a black thing so that's
cool
moving on the other thing what thing
this topic
no-oh-oh on is sort of actually
Microsoft was an expert witness no I
don't read that part what it was like
click on the click on the forum link
that came to us from Gemini jo1
three oh man this is this is long and I
can't share it on my screen cuz I'm
logged into the thing Wow let's just
give it all you found of this guy are
you fan not particularly do you want to
talk about that we can i I'm not I've
read it but
I don't really know the guy it's gonna
you know what we're gonna go let's
cruise right into faith sure yeah
there's two Facebook ish things today
number one at f8 which is their
developer conference which is happening
right around now they announced that
they plan to create a clear history tool
so this feature will enable you to see
the websites and apps that send Facebook
information when you use them it'll
enable you to delete this information
from your account and turn off
Facebook's ability to store that
information associated with your account
going forward they will still provide
apps and websites with aggregated
analytics that's anonymized nomina man
eyes
no no minima no minimum and this tool
won't be launching for a few months they
gotta build it and test it apparently
they're there sitting down having town
hall meetings with security experts
around the u.s. and all that kind of
stuff do you think this would be a cool
tool that you would use do you even use
Facebook uh I have one the only things I
usually want to say once once I've fully
deleted my account like four times
I uh I also didn't create make a
facebook status before don't deletion be
like hey guys again ah Facebook I just
disappeared into the ether without
telling anybody every single time I
didn't even create my original Facebook
account
one of my friends apparently I guess
Thank you Thank You Jesse by the way a
real name created a Facebook account
under my name and then gave me the login
and was like start using this and I was
like okay hook everything up to it yeah
your data is gone goodbye yeah so I've
never been a huge fan of it now I use it
for the messenger portion because
basically everyone's on there so if you
need to contact someone it's usually
order an Android thing to do
yeah basically yeah I do the same and
then I use groups a little bit I've got
two groups on there that I'm fairly
active in one for sharing music and one
for talking about nerdy things with my
high school friends you care about music
yeah yeah talk about this later okay
yeah I can just invite you to the group
yeah we're all plebs he's above us
see you can't yeah you can't can't join
the music sharing group so yeah I don't
know that's cool there's been other
stuff that's come out of WAF 8 f8 makes
way more sense 8 wow that's fantastic
but apparently they're gonna do a dating
app I don't know if I don't think we
talked about that last week oh I haven't
heard that book dating app yeah let me
let me just google this live on the show
dating app interesting first met no
Facebook dating looks a lot like hinge
Facebook is taking on tinder with new
dating features I wonder if they'll cut
off tinder from their login with face hi
I'm not I couldn't kind of doubt it they
couldn't yeah Facebook as an integral
part of tinder yeah so yeah new dating
app amid all of the crazy privacy stuff
they are directly planning on making a
dating app and it's interesting because
they're they've straight-up called out
that it will not be designed around
hookups at all that's not for you to
decide yeah I know but they're they're
pushing it to not be that way it will
not ever connect you with a friend
Facebook friend yes okay so a part of
the idea is that it pushes you to new
people that's cool and it will like keep
even the idea that you're on it away
from your friends Oh interesting so it
supposed to be private away from your
friends that you're on this thing
give us your data and we'll give you a
date yeah yeah and a big part of it is
this section they're talking about
conversation starters so though they'll
try to have like events that are
happening around you and they'll try to
use groups and things that you're both
interested in to try to come up with
something for you guys to do mmm that is
hopefully interesting yeah that's cool
one problem with the way particularly
tinder works is like you know the first
stage of tinder is like hey you think
I'm hot I think you're hot so we got
that so like boom that mystery solved
but then now you're just an empty chat
you're like what do we talk about yeah
you where do you start
so that actually might this actually
might help with that
I mean I'm dating so you know a long
time but I just having something that's
like hey we're both interested in this
thing but without having to go through
the monotony of like reading through a
basically resume yeah giant profile yeah
we need something in the middle here
yeah that's a that's an interesting idea
it's just kind of funny that they're
bringing this up at the time while
they're having all these privacy issues
but at the same time despite all the
privacy issues basically no one's
leaving Facebook mm-hmm so it's probably
fine related to that because of the
privacy things Facebook is revisiting
the possibility of having a subscription
model not it we need an option it's an
option okay okay I just want to say this
loud and clear Facebook's not gonna be
like hey want to keep your Facebook
account five more five more months fifty
bucks a month
yeah oh ad-free okay it would be an
ad-free subscription model and i-i think
it means you're gonna be giving up a lot
less data to so they looked into this in
the past and then internally basically
everyone's like I don't think that's
gonna work so they didn't bother doing
it but now they think the climb has
changed enough that enough people who
are who are considering leaving Facebook
because of data and ads might say well
it's worth it to me just to stay if they
get rid of ads and they don't scrape I
could be interested in this see I don't
know might even use Facebook for really
this is really interesting to me because
one of the questions here is like would
would the spur more people to join hell
no in my opinion no not a chance
I don't think all it would do is retain
existing customers yeah I don't think
there's gonna be anyone who's like well
whit its subscription model now I'm in I
think technically there will technically
be some of those people but I think
it'll be such an insignificant amount
that it just won't matter
it'll be the same number of people who
like want to pay with gold doubloons
instead of US dollars yeah like it's
gonna be there at all it's a really
small amount of people but I think it
will definitely increase again a very
small percentage of people but probably
a bigger one than what we were just
talking about people like me to use it a
little bit more
I don't like ads but I also don't like
running ad blocker because kind of you
know
we do a thing on the internet and when
you do things on the Internet
ad blocker has potential of taking away
all of your money it doesn't for us
obviously but I do feel like I don't
know I don't want to give it the
AdBlocker thing because the entire
Internet just gets super pissed if you
ever talk about it but anyways I don't
run an ad blocker so I prefer neither do
I I prefer to you can do whatever you
want I'm not if you do whatever you want
unless you want to be cool but and
people are like yeah I haven't gotten
around to I'm just lazy but yeah I would
rather pay a website and not have to see
ads I liked that about twitch you could
get twitch turbo now just everyone's
Amazon Prime I would have called it to
worry about twere Bo then you could have
a little like mascot for it it's war Bo
that's actually pretty cute the twerking
robot okay
not cute that's just G Bo no we're just
wait you're going this is the nacho it's
a parallel universe okay so two topics
left which one you like let's do both we
have why not both 12 minutes they're
both kind of an HP printer firmware
breaches Australian Consumer Law I have
no idea what's going on take it away
hahaha okay so I'll join you in a moment
I think this began yeah in the fall of
2016
HP sold a bunch of printers or updated a
bunch of existing printers in Australia
without telling consumers that there are
software in these in these printers or
in the firmware that is gonna limit you
from using third-party ink cartridges
and that's illegal in Australia so cool
now they're in trouble and get this HP
is offering consumers who were prevented
from using a non HP cartridge
compensation of $50 if you more than
2000 customers suffered under this under
the software and if they each get their
$50 that's gonna cost HP hold on to your
tits $100,000 HP's like wait how much Oh
great it's like that scene in Austin
Powers where he's like a million dollars
and they all start laughing yeah yeah
yeah I was worth a shot no problem it
probably got way more sales on ink than
that hundred thousand dollars yeah
that's that's really not a lot
especially because not all the consumers
are gonna even claim this know the late
laziness will prevail in a lot of these
kind of situations it's like it's like
the idea behind like why are there still
mail-in rebates why isn't it just
automatically taken off at the til
efforts you're probably not gonna mail
it in heck you know especially now God
even in the even when snail mail was
just called mail I wouldn't do that
yeah yeah and most people wouldn't so
the the discount actually becomes when
you when you do the math on your end
it's not ten dollars off every single
item that you sell
it's ten dollars off like actually a
pretty small portion but you will
probably send sell more because you can
post the price as being lower because
you're like it's lowered because of mail
and rebate but then no one does it
anyways stupid stuff but genius yeah
so there it's not anything to be close
to how to tell us how much isn't a new
like proprietary HP ink cartridge I
don't know a lot of bucks let's I think
it really depends on I wish I had the
model number the printer here 25 36
that's the thing it really depends on
what printer it is because like this HP
61 thing and like this one but then like
the LaserJet ones more but they said ink
cartridge so it's not that okay I don't
know it really depends on what a treat
it is well all you're gonna say is even
if like half the people effected just
bought ink then they've already paid for
the whole scandal so in Australia about
60 bucks a cartridge apparently 60
Australian yeah that'll be like I think
it's stronger than Canadian peso but
like not as strong as the US so we'll
just gave me the price per pallet that's
that's cool but no exact of you not
particularly helpful at the moment well
topic yeah okay let's move on mining
it was hard and now it's gonna be harder
new bit main asic miners or easier I
approach it yeah it's harder for the
average drill
yeah easier to actually get done harder
for your average fifteen bit mean ASIC -
and it are able to mine equi hash and
it's it smashes GPU performance we've
got crypto mining Hardware blah blah for
$2000 it can perform as well as 1510
atti
GPUs at a mere 300 watts equi hash is
the algorithm used by Z caches n cache
Bitcoin gold coins e Bitcoin private
Komodos e classic and I believe
potentially even more so what this means
is that it's so much more efficient to
use this what they call an ASIC and
application-specific integrated circuit
a specialized computer it's so much more
efficient to use that than just use a
regular off-the-shelf GPU that it brings
a concern about how decentralized and
free the cryptocurrency is now because
in the utopian world that we enthusiasts
dream about anyone can can support the
network anyone can be a node in the
network because you can just use an
off-the-shelf GPU that you probably have
in your computer anyway once there is a
specialized machine that's sold by one
company then there's then it's
centralized basically it's not and the
thing is with these it's like you've got
a Fed then like--but main ASIC miners
and stuff it's like you're not gonna get
one they sell out so fast and their
supply is not high enough that a huge
percentage of it is people reselling it
or kind of more like back-end deals but
at that temp is that temporary by the
time it becomes easy enough for you to
buy one they'll be close enough to the
next one that you probably shouldn't
that's good that's sort of been the
pattern for a long time but I mean for
the industry in the future won't there
be competition there could be two or
three people producing these things
we'll see I think a lot of companies are
kind of scared about jumping in because
it's such an incredibly volatile market
mm-hmm that's why it's our future
yeah like has a stabilized first we'll
see yeah it'll be interesting and like
Bitcoin is slightly going back up sort
of maybe so I don't know who knows we'll
see I'm into the ether price that's what
I look at every day here we go damn it's
almost 800 us again yes almost at half
of what it was what is what does Jake
feel about all this yeah yeah no one can
hear you get in the show get in the show
so what he's saying is there is other
companies and like yeah I know we've
talked about them on on wine show before
and but there's a lot of like what he's
saying is by the time these things hit
market even bit Maine has been mining on
them themselves or a long time so like I
don't know the mining space is so it's
it's very it's very messy you have to be
like really into it to to probably stay
on top of the thing is though like this
algorithm equi hash was meant to it was
like designed to prevent centralization
of the mining process and there's been
other cryptocurrencies about this
happened to and then after these Asics
come out they just like alter the
algorithm so that it it kind of
nullifies the lead that those Asics give
it themselves yeah
so maybe people right now people don't
know if a crash will do the same thing
and then GPUs will still be relevant
fork but either way we won't know until
the future and speaking of the future
that's where you'll have to be to see
the next wine show or to see any more of
the wine show cuz we're gonna leave yes
yeah there's a parallel universe there's
a many worlds hypothesis here where
there's a ranch or Ananas show yeah well
so if you want to see either one of
those come back here in seven days minus
one hour and you'll be good to go well
probably not even the minus one
we were on time today yeah seven days -
like 20 minutes anyways guys good bye
play the intro Oh
okay we're gonna clench yeah okay which
one am i this one I'm the couch yes
perfect I'm not little companion cube on
the couch that lies just yay Squarespace
no private access and you wanna do it
again no I thought I'd missed it that's
why I did it okay there we go
fresh bucks thank you very much we'll
see you next time LaShawn slash north</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
