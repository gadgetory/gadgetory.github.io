not the moment per se but the systems
have all arrived so we get to go through
and look at exactly what came out of
those cluster phone calls and evaluate
both the packaging the shipping and of
course the physical build unboxing
experience so come along for the ride oh
by the way Alienware is going first
disco cool
with glasswire you can instantly see
your current and past network activity
you can detect malware and you can block
badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Lynas to
get 25% off at the link below okay ah no
I actually don't have a knife on me yes
so first up is delay lien we're thanks
alright so this is our Alienware
something-or-other
ah here we go our Alienware Aurora
system with one x MDOT to nvme clearly
these guys are new to retail packaging
that is going to mean so much to the
average consumer so Dells total was 20
days from the time of ordering to the
time of the system arriving and that is
20 real calendar days not 20 business
days so about 2/3 of a month now the
invoice they sent us was a really weird
aspect of the Aurora system because it
was full of a bunch of like jargony
things and there wasn't really we didn't
have a clear idea of exactly what was
coming or we wouldn't have if they
hadn't walked us through it on the phone
in terms of accessories did you know
this thing comes with like nothing like
look at this so we get a warranty safety
and regulatory information pamphlet we
get a Quick Start Guide which basically
says connect the keyboard and mouse
which is not present if you see connect
the network cable optional connect the
display connect the power cable and
press the power button ok and we get a
power cable is that really it well did
you try selling us a $10 keyboard and
mouse I guess it's better to not include
it and not have to pay for it then to
pay for stuff you don't need
in terms of the quality of the packaging
job that they've done here there's
already something that I've noticed yeah
it is not a good thing to have a system
loosely packed inside a box you want
everything closed up as tightly as
possible so there's still a fairly good
chance that our system is just fine
because at least Dell is using a very
high quality closed cell foam here so
you can see that it's it's strong but
it's also not gonna crumble and crack if
the whole box gets impacted by anything
so that allows it to stay strong and it
has some it has some give to it which is
really important when it's sitting you
know vibrating on the back of a truck or
whatever else I actually haven't seen an
Aurora system in a very long time it's
got some heft to it that's probably as
much to do with it being a steel case as
anything else I guess we need a
screwdriver hey screw me that's good all
right I don't really have any complaints
about the plastics I mean Dells done a
pretty good job of these kinds of things
for a long time now get some of that
peel action going on here Oh interesting
it's perfect it's perforated just in
case you're like one of those horrible
people who leads the plastic on your
electronics it's still gonna die that's
awesome
it's like actually an idiot proofing
measure cuz it's the same thing here at
the back - it's all cheese grater that
is freaking hilarious terms of Io not
bad USB 3 USB 3.1 type C another USB 3
Osseo can't take headphone jacks for
granted these days
there we go so our side panel does
actually make use of the chassis
intrusion detection so we're probably
going to get a notification about that
there's our RGB PCB for the lighting in
this sort of triangular do that they got
going on here we actually can't see a
lot about the internals of this machine
so we've got a 120 millimeter cooling
fan sucking air in from the front here
we've got a very oh em great looking gtx
1060 that's with a rear blower design
plastic shroud so it's not like a like a
high quality like founders edition metal
shroud or anything like that but at this
price point I wouldn't have expected
that this is nice to see so we've got
card support so even though there was
some extra space in the box the chances
of this card coming out of that slot or
breaking it off I've seen that very slim
I got a kick out of this
yep a swing out I think so so I think
you unlock these and then yeah oh that's
kind of cool so all the cabling stays in
place for our SATA power our PCI Express
all that good stuff and this gets us our
first look at our motherboard so having
reviewed a high-end Alienware desktop a
little while ago back when am do you
launch there thread Ripper processor I'm
not surprised by any of this but they
are using a proprietary motherboard this
is the IPC FL - SC it's got that little
alien silk-screened on it so this is
definitely specific to Alienware it's
got a mere four pin power connector for
what ended up being a this is an 8700 k
processor they want a faster remember
ten times faster very important to
remember that this is the exhilarating
power to it and then this no this is GPU
power Oh so that's weird
hey actually there's small weird stuff
in here
so look at this they use an adapter here
instead of just plugging their 24-pin
connector directly into the board and I
have to assume that it's because they're
actually using a proprietary
wire layout for this and you can you can
actually see they are so orange drawings
black red orange real ugly no black red
black black red black grey purple yes
wait white orange yeah but can yellow
does might just be whites what is going
on here what are you doing that's so
weird
what so just so you can't use a normal
power supply we should find out if the
system runs will help this plugged in
because I'd be willing to bet that it
does also notable down here is our nice
robust thick cooling fan
Wow actually that's really nice on our
AIO cooler and our 120 millimeter
radiators right up here in the top where
it's got clean access to exhaust there's
actually this is a lot more open than it
actually looks like so I would expect
cooling on the system to be quite strong
but check it out DS arnott cooled that's
true and then as usual Dells using just
generic green PCB Dems like you would
get from all direct from micron overall
I am less disappointed than I was
expecting as long as you have compatible
components and right now the motherboard
and the power supply our big question
marks this is a standard ATX if
motherboard standard ATX power supply
and it is easily user serviceable if you
wanted to add a hard drive or whatever
the case may be
so the HP ordering experience was a
little bit unique the invoice still
didn't have a full spec list it looks
like yeah it looks like it is actually
written on the side of the box though so
we're gonna get a better idea of what
we're dealing with here very shortly but
was what was really interesting as they
put themselves at a disadvantage by
canceling our order five days after we
placed it and letting us know that the
issue was that we used hangouts to call
and so the number didn't match our
credit card after we resolved it though
the system was shipped the next day and
so they still even with the five day
head start that they gave everybody else
still managed to deliver the gaming
system to
door ready to be gamed on first alright
we get a keyboard a mouse
I follow the packing job they do
definitely gets extra points versus Dell
because while the quality of this
material is slightly lower like it's
still a nice flexible foam rather than
the brittle kind it's packed in tight so
once you close the flaps there's no room
for it to move around one plug to push
button
so our final spec 8th gen core i7 8700
non K so it's gonna be about one-tenth
the speed of the Dell then 16 gigs ram
256 gig nvme SSD a 2 terabyte hard drive
2x2 Wi-Fi and holy crap HP is putting
themselves in a pretty good position
here to run away with this this is
equipped with a gtx 1070 now the 1060
versus the 1070 is not a small step up
that K series processor that Dell upsold
is going to have to have some serious
performance benefits in order to
outweigh the improvement in GPU that we
get with our omen here
that's nice carbon-fiber replica
actually I'm liking their industrial
design a little bit better as well too
so I don't know what the deal is with
the O's optical drive includes an
optical drive did the Dell even include
an optical drive nope if we're not
making other compromises it's better to
have it than to not have it this is a
really interesting window too they've
got like this really dark tinting on the
window
and I can actually just see through it I
think we're gonna get some nice
illumination effects there you can also
see there's a couple of little extra
steps they've taken with the chassis
here so powder coating now powder
coating doesn't cost a lot but you can
tell HP spent the extra couple of bucks
to make sure that even the back of their
system which you wouldn't normally look
at is all black including the power
supply IO is another strong point we've
got an SD card reader to type C's and to
Taipei's along with our audio ooh
the inside of the system looks a lot
better too much more standard though so
there's no swing out and gain access to
key components for upgrades or anything
like that and one place where HP is
clearly behind Dell here is the case
cooling configuration and CPU cooling so
rather than using a 120 millimeter
exhaust to balance out the 120
millimeter intake at the front HP is
just using a mere 92 millimeter exhaust
and what's really weird about that is
that it looks like it actually has space
for a 120 mil here they're using an
adapter bracket so that's a case of kind
of spending 30 cents to save a dollar
from my experience because the 120 mil
can doesn't cost that much more what if
they're going for positive case pressure
on purpose that's possible but they
could also just order a case fan with a
lower rpm that would solve the same
problem not weird hey mounting the
adapter then mounting a 92 mm fan to it
I've notice that their graphics card
while still an HP specific SKU goodnight
an HP sticker here HP part number there
these put a little bit of extra into
making it more stylized so if you were
to ever open up your case you've got
this graphic on the shroud you've got
this sort of like Chrome's GeForce GTX
logo here and it uses a matte black PCB
which I'm always in favor of another
interesting note is that the VRMs again
have nice big heat sinks on them and in
this case it's across all of them above
and to the side of the CPU socket still
16 gigs of ram and bears are nvme
see down there that looks like another
HP specific model it starts with an M
and IC SEC somewhere in there so I'm
guessing that's a Samsung yeah it's a
Samsung model of some sort and then
there's our hard drive right there yeah
check that out we've got hot swap cages
here so you just well somehow presumably
really you guys just slide it very cool
that's nice
here there's your easy upgrades this is
just bonus dang HP this is a good omen
but get it for the videos to come okay
so this next either divert power yeah
very funny okay yeah so cyber power they
wouldn't recommend a system so they were
booted from the running which means I
know who's next it's gonna be I by power
now this box looks like it went through
hell to get here this side really does
look like someone gave it a good quality
sidekick now did you notice that nobody
asked us like what kind of case we
wanted I don't think I actually had
options door well normally isn't that
kind of like I buy power and CyberPower
stick well in this case guy actually
found the best system for the budget and
he'd never really asked about stylist
because she didn't specify either so the
double-edged sword of having such a wide
variety of configs to offer your
customers is that you have selection but
the disadvantage is that it's harder to
make a cohesive package out of your
systems so we've just got the box for
the system in like a master carton that
quite frankly probably isn't giving it a
much better chance of arriving intact
than if it was just shipped without it
cuz assuming that the shipper adheres to
the this side up sticker which you can
see is right there then yes this is
actually quite a firm sort of eggshell
carton style foam and it would help with
impact significantly but there's so much
room for it to bang around from side to
side and I mean come on we've all seen
the videos let's see how our system did
so we got as you see two gaming mouse
and an Aries II one gaming keyboard with
spill resistant structure you've got a
customer service line we can call and a
Quick Start Guide well they already lied
package includes a desktop Tower and
gaming keyboard gaming mouse nice high
quality foam here though really soft but
really strong so our modular clearly
EVGA power supply that was included gets
all the extra cables bundled up nicely
for us and a handy resealable bag little
touches like that make a difference when
you're trying to upgrade your system
three years down the line oh where do I
put all that stuff so we've clearly
gotten Asus graphics card MSI
motherboard EVGA power supply they're
all gonna be brands that you recognize
again this is one of the challenges with
having any number of different case
designs is you can't have custom
packaging and you can't have custom
brackets to hold everything together in
shipping so what they've done is they've
included this foam packaging material
inside to prevent your system from
getting damaged in shipping you'll also
notice that these instructions are for
this like ancient I think that's a raid
Maxx case from like 15 years ago
yeah they don't correspond to the way
that you would actually open this
chassis it doesn't have screws at the
back and you don't need a screw driver
that's something that I really think
they could do a better job of for new
users to their credit though we actually
looked into using these at NCIX in the
past and I had wanted to do it like if I
recall correctly these cost a couple
bucks each for 50 there you go so that
adds a significant amount to the cost of
a system but it's all about getting it
there in one piece for the buyer wow
that is a very bare-bones
looking system compared to our
our HP omen there so just like our alien
where we've got better cooling for the
CPU but we've compromised on our cooling
floor of the CPUs VRM which may or may
not matter because what CPU is actually
even in here this is actually a 9600 I
9600 will check whether it's kilo note
and a member they sold it to us before
it was launched so we're honor ordered
it that would probably explain why even
though this is a fairly simple build
they still took what about 20 days to
deliver the final system now the thing
is what happened in the middle is that
the PSU were usually ordered was out of
stock so they gave us a free upgrade
with a 750 grammes really yeah that's
pretty good
speaking of the power supply they've
done a better job at the back of making
sure that you use the correct video port
so Alienware had onboard video but
didn't specify in their QuickStart guide
where you should plug your monitor into
these guys say hey don't plug it in here
and they've got a sticker on the back to
make sure that you don't plug in your
system and run it before you remove the
foam insert because I've talked to sis
before it's like a big problem people
just turning the system on and letting
it cook
foam taking up the entire inside in
spite of the kind of bareness looking of
it it's obviously modular and easily
upgradable because it uses all standard
off-the-shelf components and they're all
free quality brands that I would trust
so we've got MSI motherboard a Zeus gtx
1070 graphics card to go with that 9
series cpu a day to ram
looks like 16 gigs of it corsair liquid
cooler EVGA power supply and we've got a
toshiba one terabyte drive for the back
this thing is gonna shred when it comes
to gaming performance and a processor is
the cake
the only drawback here is gonna be that
this is a SATA SSD rather than an nvme
SSD and that might affect system
responsiveness but from my experience
not much I buy power is looking pretty
good here
yeah that's a pretty poor application of
that sticker yeah they could have put a
little more effort into that I think it
was origin before main gear right yes
its origin okay
so far the unboxing experience feels
pretty special but based on what I'm
expecting about the specs of this
machine it had better be really special
so they include what seems like a
reasonable quality mouse mat that's kind
of nice to see did they ask for shirt
size yeah you get to pick you told them
XL Oh Janice thanks Janice so they
actually benchmark the system somewhat
since in the bench yeah so they're
assembled on one day QA the next burning
and ship on the third day the
interesting 450 watt Silverstone power
supply again recognizable brand names
and the sy motherboard and this is
interesting it's a core i5 8400 so what
happened here was we've got an 8400
which they up sold us telling us it
would be a lot better which of course it
would be but it didn't technically fit
in our budget so we resolved to
benchmark this system both ways with
what they up sold us and with what they
would have originally shipped and
honestly given that it they did send it
with a GTX 1050 Ti
I'm not expecting it to improve much
remember this is a 1500 US dollar system
and this poster and what else you got
over there
scums team code a Star Trek Vanguard
starter pack and shroud of the avatar
steam code along with call of duty black
ops for still these better be some
amazing games on that 1050 Ti very high
quality foam credit to them for that and
it was all packed tightly within the
outer box and credit to origin there
Chronos is a sexy little machine
a sexy little machine that probably
should have had some plastic filled
stuff on the front see that oh boy
origin PC the thing with someone like
origin is that we are paying a fair bit
extra for the custom chassis and it has
some cool features of the Kronos which
we've actually featured before has these
magnetic feet as well you got to do is
move them and then you can have it in a
tower configuration or a desktop
configuration and it is extremely
compact so this is the smallest of the
systems that we've looked at today it
looks like it has managed to stay in
position and because they're using a PCI
Express riser to install the graphics
card it doesn't seem to have come out
yet but given enough time this would
cause a problem please tell me at least
have 16 gigs around all right
so cooling we've got an 80 ml on the
front that goes directly over these
perforated two and a half inch cages for
our solid-state drive remember that is a
mere 120 gig solid-state drive quality
components you got a silverstone sfx
power supply here eeda graphics MSI
motherboard Kingston or HyperX memory
with Origin co-branding on it so this is
again your motherboard accessories your
power cord your extra power supply
cables and any documentation that came
with your parts
also they throw in a USB Drive that's
actually they recover a USB I believe
okay that's a nice touch that is a nice
touch and it's 16 gigs and then you've
got their own a i/o cooler it's an ASA
tech based unit though so it sits just
fine to me the big disappointment was
that our unboxing experience was marred
by these these handprints on our system
and that it seems like Origen gave up a
lot to have their custom chassis with
their fancy motherboard and ended up
with a bit of a miss SPECT system like I
would I wouldn't recommend this to
someone who's purely after gaming
performance this brings us finally to
main gear PC these guys were also right
in that
funniest day range and they did a really
excellent job of keeping us updated on
the status of our order throughout so
after placing the order they said hey
you know we've got your order hey now
your systems being kitted you know
here's all the parts that are picked hey
its assembled hey it's shipped and
bippity Boppity here's our system so
right now
this is kind of main gears competition
to lose because they definitely did the
best job of the pre-sales experience and
honestly so far the packaging and
feeling pretty good about as well as is
a nice high quality phone it's all packs
nice and snugly within the outer carton
and there's a second internal carton I
think the odds of this getting damaged
in shipping a quite slim okay more solid
packing materials really nice phone Wow
these guys go all out so they have also
invested the what do you say it was
about four dollars into foaming up the
inside of the system it's dangerous to
go alone take this cute
you can tell they actually use the
actual system that I mean not the exact
one but the same configuration for their
startup guide also in here our invoice
windows recovery documents and
accessories resealable very nice that's
another board table case screws in case
you have any want to upgrade and you got
a pen and some sticker the keychain
coaster I'd say that's a b-minus
mousepad it doesn't have a stitched edge
so it's gonna frame more than the other
one you can see plus they write you a
little note on the inside of your box
enjoying Yvonne alright before powering
on you must first remove the packing
foam inside your computer no real
instructions on how to do it though
that's something that I think I buy
power for all the deficiencies in their
instructions did a better job of making
clear so this seems mostly designed to
prevent the graphics card from moving
around like clearly they don't think the
radiators gonna come off or anything
like that so our config in here is an
interesting one
we've got the best cooling for the CPU
out of any of our systems here we've got
an overclockable CPU so that's a rising
520 600 X we've got 16 gigs of ram
non-expandable unfortunately but then
we've got a dt x 1060 intel SSD and then
we've also got a Seagate Barracuda 1
terabyte drive for our games down in the
bottom I'm expecting the system to
perform decently but any points that
main gear gained during the ordering
process they are probably going to end
up losing in gaming performance nothing
against AMD but this CPU is not going to
perform as well as our Intel based
machines in that particular application
and our GTX 1060 well let's just say we
probably would have been better off
spending our dual radiator money on a
1070 and putting a stock cooler on it
maybe the benchmarks will tell the whole
story so that's it then ordering process
and initial impressions complete let us
know in the comments below who you think
is going to be coming out ahead and our
secret shopper showdown next up is going
to be customer support how do they
handle it if the system doesn't work a
