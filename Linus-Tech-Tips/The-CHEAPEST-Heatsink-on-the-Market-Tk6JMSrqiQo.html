that we bought on eBay possibly be how
do you even make a computer cooler for
five dollars ship to our door
five dollars well we're going to find
out on the cheap and heat sink on the
market and yes my friends we are
starting another series the treatments
on the market and it's going to be
flippin awesome
HP's new omen X lineup comes equipped
with Intel 7th generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description the brand is XY CP
and this is the whatever that is CPU
cooler 65 watt maybe that says 3-year
warranty and also have support for core
i7 and 12 something ok let's get it open
so that my friends holy crap it's like
feather-light that is five dollars worth
if you think I mean look at this when
they were designing the the flower heat
sinks in arrangement like this just
looks like a you know someone
accidentally you know bumped it on the
assembly line see this hook kind of came
off their CV no problem no problem you
just put that baby back together no big
deal but but look at this there were
like wasn't room for the for them frame
for the fan so they're just like no
problem we'll just bend it no big deal
no problem that's where the that's where
the wire comes out okay so we're looking
at an 80 millimeter fan they're
somewhere in between like 75 millimeter
fan feet that's 80 milk oh man this
stuff this stuff looks quality and see
there mmm that's a good stuff that's a
good stuff right there Luke really runny
actually that doesn't look especially
quality look at this please
like this is like another thermal
volcano warning remove before
installation warning have your head
checked before installation all right so
you can see what they've done here the
construction method is pretty actually
very very basic so they've got these
these pieces right here that are
basically running all the way through
and compressing so they've got all these
fins coming in you can actually follow
the lines it's quite cheaply made this
is a very old old construction method
they've got these four pieces of
aluminum on that either side that extend
the base and that are basically used to
crush all the fins together then they
machine the bottom as flat as they can
in a couple of minutes there and ship it
off now let's put this thing up against
its main competitor so the stock Intel
heatsink was the fan and the mounting
hardware is a hundred and eighty grams
this bad boy comes in 157 can it
possibly hold up so first things first
we've got to clean off our CPU with
alcohol so the most fair possible
comparison we're using a 7700 K then
I've got a brand new Intel stock cooler
and go ahead and throw that bad boy on
there so I'm using the included thermal
compound we're not introducing extra
variables in our test so we're going to
hit this baby with an eye 264 stress
test here we go
utilization 100% CPU temp well we'll
give them a minute
I'm just taking in the sound will just
absolutely
okay so you can probably hear the way
that the fan is
here that ramping up and ramping down so
our temperatures and our turbo speed
actually reasonable so we're hanging in
here at 4.45 gigahertz on our 7700 K all
the way up to 4.5 so this thing's turbo
lling up to of a max at a hundred
percent load and we're sitting at about
85 degrees on the CPU package ideal
perhaps not but certainly not going to
damage it but what we also hear is that
that fan is working really hard to keep
it there so let's lock that sound in our
minds and try out our five dollar
heatsink all right so with it clean now
we can put on our thermal lava here oh
look at that that oh shoot oh okay well
Oh quality Oh beautiful okay okay now
I'm ready with my mounting hardware you
basically put these little clear plastic
inserts into the hole that corresponds
to the socket you want so at 775 or 1150
whatever then we just put this on here
oh you got tell me this is not going to
align oh man oh you hear that crunching
oh shoot I definitely don't know it's
going to fit that way oh how am I going
to get this out now maybe if I can push
out oh crap shoot up on there real good
now
well maybe I can get this side I don't
know how I'm gonna remove this after
Oh
I gotta get to begin card off here right
okay well there are some creature
comforts that definitely some with using
a more modern design but if we put it on
this way I think you might actually be
okay here
shoot it's going to interfere with the
RAM before I can press it all the way
down to take the RAM out here we go I'm
gonna make it open up yes okay
we have a mount but can I get the RAM
back in now
that is the question I'm sorry do still
I'm sorry to subject your memory to this
ah there we go look at that it's like
it's designed for it it's it's like
right there yeah yeah boyee all right
let's turn this thing on all right so
it's got this like you know
orange spinning dial to you know what it
actually looks pretty cool right I
legitimately think it looks cooler than
the stock heatsink just because of that
that orange fan systems booted so we
clearly haven't outright broken anything
oh boy I don't think this is a good sign
I already heard it ramped up for a
second there but let's fire this up
okay here we go oh oh dang
a hundred and one degrees on the CPU
packet ah it's painful look at the
throttling look at the throttling 19
percent thermal throttling oh the
humanity
ah we've already fallen from four point
five to four point two four gigahertz it
just can't keep up ah so if the question
was could a $5 you think be worse than a
free he'd think the answer is in fact
yes my friend but doesn't performance
hold up to what I would expect for a $5
product given that if you try and buy
one of these on eBay it'll actually cost
you about $15 then yes yes it holds up
to what I would expect I am shocked that
we got anything for $5 even something as
ineffective as this remember it's rated
for 65 watts not the 95 Watts we threw
at it we were just wondering if hey you
know maybe it was you know under-promise
over-deliver and that's not what
happened not what happened today
