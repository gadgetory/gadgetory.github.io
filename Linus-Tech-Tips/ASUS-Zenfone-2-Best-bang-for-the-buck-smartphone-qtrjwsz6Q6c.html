Seuss's PR materials for the zenfone 2
but I think perfectly captures my
biggest gripe with this product I'm
sorry available for purchase one yes the
most annoying thing about the zenfone 2
was the fact that it took so very long
for Asus to deliver the 200 dollar
smartphone that they showed off at CES
this year but is the delay a big deal
has the competitive landscape really
changed so much in three month that it's
significantly less market shaking I
guess we'll find out strap in folks
the coarser HX 1200 eye power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power and coarser link
digital for advanced monitoring and
control click right here to learn more
Oh a soos I love those guys dearly but
they really are a PC company at heart
and it really shows through sometimes
the zenfone 2 actually comes in two
flavors a 16 gig storage version with
two gigs of LP ddr3 RAM and an atom's
e35 60 for $200 and a 64 gig storage
version with four gigs of LP ddr3 RAM in
an atom z3580 for $300 I mean RAM and
storage we've seen before but changing
out the CPU who do does that with phones
anyway other than those core speeds and
feeds both models of the phone are the
same starting at the front we've got a
5-megapixel selfie camera a 5.5 inch
1080p IPS display covered in Gorilla
Glass 3 fixed off-screen buttons above a
circular finished metal chin then around
the bottom a microUSB port and
microphone on the sides a whole lot of
nothing at the top second mic for noise
cancellation a three-and-a-half
millimeter audio jack and the quite
disappointing lock button the position
makes it kind of hard to press without
really mushing the phone into your
finger and the tactile response is
marshmallow like to put it kindly around
the back we've got a two-tone flash next
to the 13 megapixel rear camera volume
up and down buttons that can also be
used for the camera shutter and a
rear-facing speaker that I would
describe as functional but it's under
the brushed finished plastic backing
where things actually start to get
pretty interesting microSD expansion is
one feature that's been trending towards
extinction in the industry but asus has
gone ahead and included and dual
micro-sim slots
something pretty uncommon here in North
America are also present back here very
nice oh and we can't really show this
but if you were to dig in further you'd
find wireless AC and LTE chipsets as
well as the sorry it's not user
replaceable and it doesn't charge
wirelessly but it does support Qualcomm
quick charge 3000 milliamp hour battery
so those are some pretty impressive
specs am i right but what's it like to
actually hold the thing well the screen
isn't the best or brightest IPS display
I've ever seen and I'm not a huge fan of
the five and a half inch form factor but
I've got to give it to Asus it handles
pretty well their reviewers guide
however one-sided its representation of
the facts might be makes a point that
I've made multiple times about the
awkwardness of a flat-backed versus a
curved back device and other than that
physically Wow I guess there's really
not much to say it's a Pho any phone
depending on who it is you ask so let's
talk the make or break of any Android
device the Android 5 lollipop based Zen
UI skin and this is going to be a tough
one here folks because then you eye does
some things very right and something's
very wrong and some in-between so let's
start with the former responsiveness is
solid although it should be given that
the zenfone 2 m CPU performs similarly
to a Snapdragon 801 according to this
Tom's article quick settings are
customizable and available for pretty
much any phone setting you could
possibly want and on the subject of
settings there is some fan bit elite
astok stuff buried in the settings menu
separate user profiles including a kid
mode that allows time limits and locks
down certain apps some super smart do
not disturb settings like ignoring a
call from someone the first time then
accepting it the second since it's
presumably urgent automatic phone call
recording although you'll want to check
on the legality of this in your area
before activating it the auto start
manager that lets you force apps to wait
for your permission to launch and do
anything in the background customizable
gestures like DoubleTap to wake and
sleep and double volume tap to wake to
camera and even the ability to tweak the
saturation and color temperature of your
display or save your screenshots as a
PNG instead of a JPEG I mean to even
things of that but
every in there is a yang for every up
there is a down and for all the positive
things I found about Zen UI there were
definitely some others that urged me
first up in real talk Thai masseuse what
is up with the incredible number of
pre-installed apps it's some of them
like flashlight I guess we need but
everyone else just does this through the
quick toggle directly so I don't get why
it needs to launch an app on the zenfone
2 and some of these things are just
inexcusable what the chuffing hell is
Zen circle are you a social network
company now a soos why is the fact that
it comes with Trend Micro nonsense on it
considered a selling point in the
reviewers guide even Samsung has finally
figured this out if a feature is useless
to 99% of your users make it an optional
download don't pack your device full of
junk
that nobody cares about which leads to
complaint number two the overall polish
the asus launcher wasn't configured with
notification access by default causing
my lock screen to never display my new
alerts the app that lets you use your
phone on the desktop actually super
handy very cool but also kind of janky
the phone actually locked up outright
twice on me during the time I was using
it including a startling full power off
while I was writing an email with 15
percent battery showing on the meter and
then when I went to turn it back on and
told me the battery was dead and on the
subject of battery life I've confirmed
with a soos that I'm running the latest
firmware but I haven't been able to get
past 8 p.m. without topping up the
battery now in their defense I am a bit
of a power user all the radios on all
the time is my policy I got like
smartwatches and stuff but with a 3000
milliamp hour battery capacity I should
be easily making it through the day so I
suspect software whether it's one of my
usual apps that disagrees with Zen UI or
some of the stupid bloke that asu's
pre-loaded I think there's something
stealthily draining battery in the
background but unfortunately my usual
battery meter apps are not picking up on
it so I'll try and post in the video
description when and if I figure out
what it is which leads to the other
make-or-break smartphone feet
these days the camera I'm torn on this
one too on the one hand the manual mode
is great for camera geeks and using the
super resolution like multi exposure
merging mode and the low-light for
pixels acting as one for higher
sensitivity modes result in some
shockingly good photos Albee it with a
higher processing time cost and/or a
lower resolution cost in both ideally
lit and poorly lit situations on the
other hand while the Toshiba sensor
behind the F 2.0 lens might be okay it's
not very feature-rich with a max video
resolution of 1080p and no slo-mo
support whatsoever
it lacks optical image stabilization the
camera launches quite slowly and the
auto photo mode the one most people will
usually use is just not very good with
smeary noise reduction processing
artifacts eliminating a lot of the
detail from even photos that are taken
under pretty good conditions but this is
a $200 smartphone off contract for the
base model and even for the $300 one you
get more than a token increase in
storage with CPU and RAM upgrades being
thrown in along with a perdu poleng of
your storage not to mention that asus
has committed to allowing bootloader
unlocking and that they even includes a
quick charger something HTC couldn't be
bothered to do on a smart phone that
costs over twice as much so here's the
conclusion while it's not perfect at the
price the bottom line is a soos you're
going to have a lot of to clean up when
the zenfone 2 is done picking all the
ass it's going to kick out there in the
market and you can quote that on the box
if you want to speaking of kicking a lot
of ass crunchyroll is the site created
