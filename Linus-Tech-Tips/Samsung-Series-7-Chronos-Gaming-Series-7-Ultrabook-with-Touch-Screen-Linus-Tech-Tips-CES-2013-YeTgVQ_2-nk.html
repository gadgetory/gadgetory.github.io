start with the Siri seven Chronos
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner so
this is an update to their existing
series seven funnels that adds
touchscreen functionality as well as an
updated spec you can get this guy with
up to 100 byte of storage 16 gigs of ram
a core i7 it is significantly thinner
than the old one but even more important
than any of that is the fact that it
ships as a Radeon 88 70 graphics card
with two gigs of RAM so while this looks
like a professional machine that you
could actually not look out of place at
a business meeting with it is a
reasonably capable gaming machine to say
the least in terms of i/o you've got
your power in you've got this innovative
little Ethernet jack that pops down
because the profile the notebook is
actually too slim for a full size
Ethernet jack VGA out again makes it
suitable for business travel but also
gaming HDMI out to super speed USB 3
ports a headphone microphone combo port
I want to just show you guys the
thinness of the unit with my trademark
iPhone comparison there you go nice big
touchpad love to see that especially if
these wide format monitors it drives me
crazy it drives me crazy when you have a
small touchpad however that's not really
where this guy shines it has a 10-point
multi-touch touchscreen the biggest
difference between this and the older
Chronos on the other side we find s the
expansion 2 USB 2.0 ports as well as a
Kensington logs we couldn't see this too
well in the last shot but I've turned on
the backlit keyboard so the back light
shines through both the letters and
around the outside of the keys please
feel overall very solid and actually
that Wow look at that check this out
guys so I'm gonna do one of my trademark
flex tests so I'm putting fair amount of
pressure on the notebook itself there's
almost no flex to the unit whatsoever so
that really does show the build quality
that goes into something like this
beyond
just the actual specs that it runs one
thing I missed on that last one guys is
the JBL audio that's integrated I'm glad
to see all manufactured pretty much
everyone stepping up and improving the
audio experience that you have with your
notebook right here we have their series
7 Ultrabook and this addresses every
complaint I could have had about their
last generation series 7 Ultrabook one
thing is it adds the 10-point
multi-touch the next thing is this is
not a TN panel anymore this is a pls
panel which means that the viewing
angles are outstanding look at this
orange right here okay that's not gonna
work if I do it that way look at this
orange I'm gonna tilt this you're gonna
see it still looks orange so that is why
you're going to have just a totally
premium experience with this mod with
this with this model I hate seeing TN
panels on high-end notebooks this is a
truly high-end notebook it has an 85 70
oh crap I think I screwed that one up 85
70 Samsung's upgraded series 7 ultra
book has pretty much everything I could
have asked for they've added dedicated
graphics with an 85 70 Radeon graphics
processor with one gig of memory it's
configurable with a core i5 or Core i7
you can configure it with up to 256 gigs
of SSD storage and last but not least up
to 8 gigs of memory but it's not all
just about that so yes it's extremely
slim and that's all fine and good and
all that so we'll do our traditional
iPhone comparison for thickness here I'm
actually going to fold down the screen
just because it should wake up instantly
because it has an SSD inside it
there you go extremely slim let's show
the i/o so we've got one of those
folding gigabit ethernet ports love
seeing full-size Gigabit Ethernet on an
ultrabook HDMI super speed USB 3
headphone microphone combo VGA out with
an adapter which makes it perfect for
business 2 USB ports Kensington lock and
SD expansion ok so yes gaming on the go
yes Ultrabook touchscreen now so they've
added a full multi-touch touchscreen and
more important than anything else about
it in my personal opinion is the fact
that they are no longer using a TN panel
on their series 7 Ultrabook this is a
pls panel which means that when they say
178 degree viewing angle they actually
mean it have a look at how the screen
looks from here
I'm gonna tilt it like this it looks the
same except for reflection your colors
are not going to distort whether you
change the angle horizontally or
vertically you can still see the color
on the screen love high-end screens love
dedicated GPUs and I love touchscreen
when it comes to Windows 8 machines so
this looks pretty good stay tuned for
