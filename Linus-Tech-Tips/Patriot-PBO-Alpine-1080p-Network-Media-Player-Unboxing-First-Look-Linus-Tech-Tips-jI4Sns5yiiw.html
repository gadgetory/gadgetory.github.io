the PBO Alpine so this is the successor
to the immensely popular Patriot box
office so you can see here up in the
corner it is powered by Android 2.2
although it should be you got a bear in
mind that you can't necessarily install
you know Angry Birds on it or anything
like that but it is still compatible
with apps whether developed by Patriot
or whether developed by end users who
want to enable more functionality on the
device so you can use apps but not
necessarily the entire you know
marketplace like you can use on your
phone because most of the apps require
are touchscreen which is obviously not
present so this is a full HD media
player yes it is compatible with 1080p
it better be at this point does YouTube
HD mind has DTS as well as Dolby Digital
let's go ahead and flip it around so him
full HD all-in-one media player built
over the Android 2.2 OS freezer digital
media library from the constraints of a
PC and bridges digital media to your
home and entertainment system brings
your entire media library to the comfort
of your living room now one of the
things that was so great about Patriot
box office was the huge compatibility
with file formats and we've seen a
continuation of that with the PBO Alpine
and that's one of the things that
Patriot will continue to work on in
order to make it as useful as possible
compatible with a variety of different
video formats different containers
images audio and you can see there's a
little bit of information about the
hardware here so it has an arm CPU up to
500 megahertz 2 USB 2.0 ports works with
a keyboard and mouse which is kind of
neat as well as hdmi 1.3 b output so you
can't do native 3d it's just something
to remember guys optional Wi-Fi with a
USB adapter that is sold separately so
let's go ahead and open it up and see
what we can see one of the things you'll
notice about it compared to the original
box office that is very very small which
is fantastic if you want to use it for
something like digital signage for
example so you can just mount it
somewhere discreet and out of the way
without worrying about anyone walking
off with it it's also good if you just
want an overall clean
looking media PC area so you don't have
to our media piece and TV area so you
don't have to have like some huge clunky
box cluttering things up now the
drawback of that is that it isn't
unfortunately compatible with adding an
internal hard drive but for the smaller
size I guess we'll have to live with
that so inside the box we have an AC
adapter an HDMI cable a user manual on
disk as well as a remote so the remote
has all of your basic functionality
navigation enter play stop forward back
of a more different forward back menu
info subtitles and audio power volume
and that pretty much does it now in
terms of interface Patriots actually
taking a fairly unique approach with
this where they have kind of a stock
more basic firmware that is going to be
designed for if your grandma wants to
watch like Korean soaps and you don't
want to like be dealing with it every
other day going over there and helping
her figure it out you just give her the
stock firmware here you go grandma
enjoy you know you set up the network
share once for her because she probably
is gonna have trouble with that and it
can actually yes this diagram is useful
it can pull media from a variety of
different sources whether it's wired or
over wireless whether it's you know
mobile or a UPnP or DLNA compatible
device or even a PC right so they have
the easy firmware for Grandma and then
if you want Patriots also developing in
parallel a more enthusiast friendly
streamer they're going to be reaching
out to the community and finding out
what they want out of this because again
that was one of the things that was
great about the box office was that they
continued to update the functionality
over time so if you're an enthusiast
that's the one you're gonna want to go
for now on the outside we see not a
whole lot because this is a very very
small device so you've got a few little
logos there you've got your SD card as
well as your USB remember you can play
media directly off of something plugged
into the PBO Alpine you don't
necessarily have to play over the
network also got indicator here on the
back we've got our ad out so you'll need
an adapter for that guy
USB HDMI out most like 99.9% of people
are probably going to be using this
Ethernet as well as power in so that's
pretty much covers it that's our basic
over that's our basic overview it's
pretty simple to use and its stock
configuration here's their entire quick
install guide connect HDMI plug in power
connect to you know something and don't
forget to enjoy don't forget to enjoy
this video and if you enjoyed it don't
forget to subscribe thank you for
checking out my unboxing your first look
