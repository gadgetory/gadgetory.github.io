the pvo Alpine so this is the successor
to the immensely popular Patriot box
office so you can see here up in the
corner it is powered by Android 2.2
although it should be you got a bear in
mind that you can't necessarily install
you know Angry Birds on it or anything
like that but it is still compatible
with apps whether developed by patriot
or whether developed by end users who
want to enable more functionality on the
device so you can use apps but not
necessarily the entire you know
marketplace like you can use on your
phone because most of the apps require
touchscreen which is obviously not
present so this is a full HD media
player yes it is compatible of 1080p it
better be at this point does YouTube HTM
ID has DTS as well as Dolby Digital
let's go ahead and flip it around so
ahem full HD all-in-one media player
built over the android 2.2 OS freeze
your digital media library from the
constraints of a pc and bridges digital
media to your home and entertainment
system brings your entire media library
to the comfort of your living room now
one of the things that was so great
about patriot box office was the huge
compatibility with file formats and
we've seen a continuation of that with
the PBO alpine and that's one of the
things that patriot will continue to
work on in order to make it as useful as
possible compatible with a variety of
different video formats different
containers images audio and you can see
there's a little bit of information
about the hardware here so it has an arm
CPU up to 500 megahertz two USB 2.0
ports works with the keyboard mouse
which is kind of neat as well as hdmi
1.3 b outputs so you can't do native 3d
just something to remember guys optional
Wi-Fi with a USB adapter that is sold
separately so let's go ahead and open it
up and see what we can see one of the
things you'll notice about it compared
to the original box office that is very
very small which is fantastic if you
want to use it for something like
digital signage for example so you can
just mount it somewhere discreet and out
of the way without worrying about anyone
walking off with it it's also good if
you just want an overall clean
looking media pc area so you don't have
to our media peace and TV area so you
don't have to have like some huge
plunging box cluttering things up now
the drawback of that is that it isn't
unfortunately compatible with adding an
internal hard drive but for the smaller
size I guess we'll have to live with
that so inside the box we have an AC
adapter an hdmi cable a user manual on
disk as well as a remote so the remote
has all of your basic functionality
navigation enter play stop forward back
of a more different forward back menu
info subtitles and audio power volume
and that pretty much does it now in
terms of interface Patriots actually
taking a fairly unique approach with
this where they have kind of a stock um
more basic firmware that is going to be
designed for if your grandma wants to
watch like Korean soaps and you don't
want to like be dealing with it every
other day going over there and helping
her figure it out you just give her the
stock firmware here you go grandma enjoy
you know you set up the network share
once for her because she probably is
going to have trouble with that and it
can actually ah yes this diagram is
useful it can pull media from a variety
of different sources whether it's wired
or over wireless whether it's you know
mobile or a upnp or DLNA compatible
device or even a PC sorry where was I
going with that right so they have the
easy firmware for Grandma and then if
you want Patriots also developing in
parallel a more enthusiast friendly
stream where they're going to be
reaching out to the community and
finding out what they want out of this
because again that was one of the things
that was great about the box office was
that they continue to update the
functionality over time so if you're an
enthusiast that's the one you're going
to want to go for now on the outside we
see not a whole lot because this is a
very very small device so you've got a
few little logos there you got your SD
card as well as your USB remember you
can play media directly off of something
plugged into the PBO alpine you don't
necessarily have to play over the
network also got indicator here on the
back we've got our ad out so you'll need
an adapter for that guy
USB HDMI out most like ninety-nine point
nine percent of people are probably
going to be using this Ethernet as well
as power in so that pretty much covers
it that's our basic / that's our basic
overview it's pretty simple to use and
install configuration here's their
entire quick install guide connect hdmi
plug in power connect to you know
something and don't forget to enjoy
don't forget to enjoy this video and if
