Computex this year and allowing me to
sit with this cow they have a cool
lapdog product check it out in video
description down below also thank you to
MSI their graphics card is actually in
this round up so basically everyone's
aftermarket custom GT X 1080 was leaked
before Computex so now that we're here
in Taipei there wasn't a ton to cover
especially because almost none of them
actually released clock speeds talking
about graphics cards without being able
to talk about how fast they are is
rather boring so what we're going to do
is like a graphics card gauntlet we're
going to go through every single
manufacturer that I could find at
Computex that had a custom GTX 1080 and
cover what I found to be their main card
I'm not going to do things that are 2
and 1/2 slots I'm not gonna do things
that are three slots just going to focus
on their main specifically to slot card
so let's go so the first card we're
going to check out is the asus rog Strix
this is an RGB card so it is compatible
with the ora system of Asus products so
you can have it match the different
colors of all the different components
in your system which is pretty sweet it
features a direct cu3 cooler other than
obviously the RGB changes and it has a
boost clock of nineteen hundred and
thirty six megahertz for the core and a
10,000 megahertz clock for the memory it
has one eight pin PCIe power connector
and one 6 pin PCI a power connector and
a really cool new feature on the end of
the card which is 2 4 pin fan headers so
you can plug system fans into this thing
and have the system fans react based on
the graphics cards temperature instead
of traditionally the CPUs temperature
which is actually probably a lot more
helpful considering how people use
all-in-one colors and stuff nowadays as
expected windforce has returned in the
form of a g1 gaming graphics card from
kicka byte but it doesn't say windforce
anywhere on it never fear it's still a
win force card there's just been some
branding changes the g1 gaming has RGB
LEDs on it sixteen point eight million
colors but it does have some orange
accents although they are under the card
in an area that most people won't see so
it might be okay in your case there was
also a bold move taken by only putting
one eight pin power connector where a
lot of the other guys are putting -
we'll have to see later on if that
actually makes a difference in
overclocking we'll see with
see scanner and stuff it might stay
tuned for a video on overclocking gtx
1080s
other than that it is a little bit more
reserved in some of the other cars we've
seen at the show but that might be fine
that might be what you're going for next
up is Emma size gaming xhg it features a
twin frozer six cooler which has some
differences in terms of the heat pipes
it has one eight millimeter heat pipe
and five six millimeter heat pipes that
feature a new flat off square design
near the block so that it should have
more surface area connection there and
it has new fins which are slightly more
curved as they go out on half of them
this card is clocked on the core at
eighteen forty seven megahertz and on
the memory at ten thousand one hundred
and eight for zotac I went with their
amp Edition graphics card it has their
spectra RGB lighting on the front of the
card it features a really good very
clean looking backplate in terms of fans
there are two of them for heat pipes you
have two eight millimeter heat pipes and
three six millimeter heat pipes for a
total of five overall and a standard
connectivity configuration of three
DisplayPort 1.4 ports one DVID port and
one HDMI 2.0 port but I don't know
anything about its clock speeds
unfortunately as those will be announced
until after the show then we have
colorful a brand that you may not be
familiar with but in certain parts of
the world is freaking huge their card is
the ex top 8g GT x 1080 it has a turbo
when you engage the button that is on
the i/o plate of up to eighteen hundred
and forty-seven megahertz and other than
that has RGB lighting a triple fan
cooler and a pretty cool looking back
point below those fans is a one
millimeter copper plate to transfer heat
from the GPU up into the heat pipes in
terms of power there's two eight pin
PCIe power connectors giving you a total
of 300 watts for the card next up is gal
axe with their EXO CGT X 1080 it has two
fans both of which are 100 millimeters
it has RGB lighting just like it
seemingly everybody else it has a metal
backplate but we actually can't see it
because both of their cards are
plastered against a wall and that back
plate will be user upgradeable to an RGB
backplate down the line in terms of
power there's one 8 pin and one 6 pin
PCI e power with a 6 plus 2 power phase
design there
two eight millimeter and two six
millimeter heat pipes and then in terms
of clock speeds I have no idea there's
no reported GPU clock speed or memory
clock speed hopefully you guys be able
to find out the next coming weeks as
these cards are coming up pretty soon
alright guys thanks for watching
hopefully that roundup wasn't too crazy
it was pretty rapid-fire so if I skimmed
over something too much like say a last
generation cooler that's on a new GT X
1080 just check out the review of that
card from the previous generation we
should cover the cooler quite a bit it
should give you a good representation of
it we should be getting more in-depth
coverage of these cards as they show up
in the office including clock speeds and
performance and all that kind of stuff
so stay tuned for that thank you to
Coursera for bringing us here to
Computex check out their lap dog in the
video description down below it lets you
use a full-size keyboard and mouse to
play games on the couch on your TV
pretty cool setup also thank you to MSI
they've got their aigis X desktop and
their own GG X 1080 which was in this
video if you want to see all the rest of
our compute X coverage or any video that
doesn't include me sitting with a cow
