this is a 2.1 speaker system put the
twist okay so let's start with the
outside of the box and then I'll get
into a little bit more detail about what
is unique about the raucous so here we
actually find absolutely no information
whatsoever okay moving around to the
other side we will find absolutely no
information whatsoever except for a
small sticker that says it is the sound
science raucous I'm going to go ahead
get my knife out here and let's get this
baby open and show you guys what is
going down and play in a cardboard box
town and last one here we are ah we have
a retail box in there I could have
actually started the unboxing with the
proper retail box rather than this well
I didn't know ever been doing that look
like how was I supposed to know okay
there we go now we're learning about
features and basically what it looks
like so it's a speaker sister okay 2.1
didn't give that away before then you
might as well unsubscribe to the channel
now because there's no hope for you
specifications here we go to point 1 5.7
inch satellite speakers we've got a 13
point 8 inch subwoofer oh no hold on
13.8 inch height subwoofer with a 6.5
inch diameter sub woofer driver okay
we've got a total weight of 8.5
kilograms output is 150 watts that is 25
watts each to the satellites and 100
watts to the sub and what all do we have
here okay here's some specs in terms of
how you hook it up so it actually
features optical audio input as well as
3.5 millimeter and RCA so it has digital
audio input these are digital speakers
it's pretty cool here we've got some
little buttons so we got 3d mode oh I
gave I gave away the twist okay we'll
talk more about 3d mode later don't look
at that yet okay then we've got the
remote control to switch between 3d and
music ah we're talking about 3d again
okay music mode is for high fidelity
music and 3d mode is for 3d technologies
for movies and
that's what they're saying okay we'll
talk about it more late more later here
let's start getting this opened up every
man can go amuse himself by looking at
that while I break the seals on this
side of the box and get closer to the
actual meat and potatoes of this
unboxing that is the part where we
remove the box camera man says stop
talking did I break it oh no it's okay
that was close ok guys so when you are
opening the raucous be very careful we
appreciate very much sound Sciences
method of packing the raucous with
starved nice thick styrofoam so when you
drop your subwoofer by accident it will
actually land on a perfectly shaped
piece of styrofoam that will prevent it
from being damaged so the first thing we
find inside the box is the subwoofer
itself so we're going to go ahead and
open this guy up there we are oh no you
got another there we are so it has a
pretty typical sort of speaker finish on
it that is it's very matte black
actually feels quite nice and looks very
very durable ok it's going to flip this
over so you guys can see it better so
it's not a very huge subwoofer by any
stretch of the imagination and it looks
like it actually has a little
instruction sheet attached to it how to
use the sound science rocket speaker
system so it shows you how to turn it on
how to do some troubleshooting stuff how
to connect the optical device okay here
it comes with okay so there's a
connector for the control pod okay so
you'll plug that in here you've also got
a three-position switch for a base level
there is your digital optical audio
input sorry about that guys then we
brought our analog connectors both RCA
as well as 3.5 auxiliary then we have
our connectors to the speaker so it
looks like we're using standard speaker
wire but there's only one
find out for sure and then we've got an
on-off switch as well as a power cord
that is a built-in power cord so then
let's have a look at what we've got in
terms of accessories so here we have RCA
cables so those are RCA to speaker wire
cables really okay okay well we'll have
a closer look at that in a minute okay
then we have RCA to headphone jack okay
next we have just headphone jack to
headphones so this is the one that
you're likely to use to connect to your
pc okay then we have the satellite
speakers themselves so we're just going
to take out one of them to show you guys
actually we take the little okay so
there you go comes with protective film
on the front of the seeker because they
are quite shiny and eat there we are
very neat a very different shape for
these speakers but haven't seen anything
like that before them very
stylish-looking okay so there's the only
and then we've got our little control
pod so this is how we can switch to
between 3d mode music mode okay we've
also got a volume control as well as a
mute control okay and it looks like that
is it for what is included inside the
box so the speakers are connected to the
back of the subwoofer right here via
this cable so we actually use an RCA
connection at the back of the speaker's
themselves see and then we use speaker
wire to connect into the subwoofer so
you can see here we've got sorry guys
with big items it's always challenging
to do a quick unboxing because we are
they're okay so here we've got this
labeled white so that'll go ahead and go
into the own really okay well I guess
there's no particular rhyme or reason to
the labels so you just plug these in and
then you go ahead and plug them into
wherever it is that you happen to have
them position so that can do the left
one okay so that's our left speaker and
then we also have any right speaker and
that want to plug in like that and go
into the other side instead okay and
then all you have to do is plug in your
control pod now here make sure those are
in there and I sink it then you plug in
your control pod plug in your selected
audio input turn it on and enjoy the
sound so the 3d mode I've actually seen
a demo of it it is pretty cool the way
it works is it uses the subtle
differences in timing of the delivery of
the sound to create a 3d sounding effect
out of two speakers so it's kind of
similar to how some of the some of the
headphones that have virtual 3d modes
work except this is a desktop speaker
that features that technology so that's
pretty much it for the raucous 3d thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
don't forget to subscribe to lie this
tech tips I've actually got one more
thing these speakers are made of
anodized aluminum and the subwoofer is
an active subwoofer with a passive
radiator so there's no annoying fan
sound coming out of the sub woofer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
