said to not be possible to fit a
computer into the bomb that comes with
the fallout anthology but with
determination and a really good 3d
printer we're gonna make it work
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description down below to learn more
alright so this isn't a normal build log
as you can probably tell this isn't a
normal case with a normal case you can
check what its compatible with and just
order things that it's compatible with
and put them in everything's fine
this is obviously not naturally
compatible with anything so there had to
be some feasibility testing already kind
of planned out the parts I've got a
Maximus impact 8 I've got a tiny little
SFX power supply from silver so this is
the 300 watt kind of gate at 450
what about that later I've got an r9
Fury nano I have some low profile
vengeance lpx I've got an SS the riser
cable we'll talk about that stuff later
I've done some planning but one problem
is part of that planning involves being
like well damn this thing is definitely
too small if you look at it the usable
space is tiny not that big and a lot of
its curves which are not that usable for
computer parts which are very much boxy
so it needed to be extended I worked
with Taryn and we 3d modelled some stuff
so we did some test things first
surprisingly and awesomely Tarin's first
one actually fit quite well we did some
minor changes to the fit and added some
fitting tabs for these fake-o screws
that are on the side also worked quite
well so we moved on to the Jumbo the big
guy
this one actually makes it tall enough
that I can fit all of my stuff now when
looking at this it maybe doesn't look
the greatest you might be like but Luke
it's lime-green the rest of its not it's
okay we'll get more to that later I'm
going to try to get some color coated
spray bombs which actually like match
the green and the brown speckle that's
already on here so we'll touch up the
aesthetic there but for the rest of the
build there's some plans but not all of
them is planned and you guys don't have
to come along with me for that
so with this bill there has to be a
balance between badassery and
functionality and one of the most
important things in my opinion with this
bill to do with badassery is this button
when you press this button right now
awesome super quality that's great but I
want this button to also turn on the
computer I could have hooked it in in
parallel on to the power switch thing
using this and stuff but there's some
voltage problems or something I'm not
super great with electronics so I'm
gonna solder in another switch how this
thing works is it's a big plate that
presses down onto another plate which
has a button mounted in it so what I'm
going to try to do is add another button
so that this plate press down actually
presses two buttons now I don't actually
have another one of these spare switches
that's where this hunkajunk comes in so
this guy up at the top I found has very
usable little tiny switch so I'm going
to drill the rivets out rip this thing
out separate it from these wires cut
that off tear it out mount it into that
plate solder it into the thing and then
hopefully it works I might just break it
oh yes I will just break it so it's
actually just this module right here
that I need
it's okay you're probably editing this
okay I think that open it up for me
there we go
well I'm salvaging this computer case
I'm ripping out its switch and I'm using
it for something else
so if that's not fall out I don't know
what is I just need two of the wires and
I only need the ones that go to the
actual switch itself one thing that's
really cool that I got for this build is
this tiny little low-profile SATA cable
although the SATA connections on this
board are right next to the RAM so it's
kind of a problem but if I put it in the
bottom slot down here and just kind of
work the cable around the bottom of the
RAM but above the PCI Express slot I can
kind of make it come out just fine
so this will work for my SSD okay so I'm
just testing to make sure that the
system actually works so this is the
massive components that I have to get
inside of the bomb got postcode nope
there we go okay so I don't have a
keyboard or anything installed but as
you guys can see on the monitor honestly
that's good enough the system works so
moving on I need to turn this off then I
need to wrap my switches things around
these poles maybe I can't wrap it around
can I get a helper go hey hey okay
so now I need to solder this in place so
it's not just held by me thank you
helper colton you can go back to doing
whatever you do and we're good to go
theoretically it works so now as long as
I don't massively screw up everything by
my terrible soldering job we're good
okay so my horrible horrible horrible
horrible horrible soldering job is done
and turn the power spy on doesn't
automatically turn on that's a good
thing press the button yes okay
the button works I need to find a way to
mount this little box on the plastic
plate that is already in there and
already has one switch seem to add
another one god I'm happy that it worked
this one has a lot more travel time than
this one does this one's a very shallow
press also the button swivels on a fixed
point on the bottom
I would like to mount this as high as
possible but there's stuff blocking a
tall mount in here's the ideal location
is where this random kind of plus symbol
post is gonna have to try to remove that
and then drill through it and see if I
can mount something right there might
not want to show that it's like not a
proper way to use a drill just so Taryn
knows I'm just going to hold my switch
in the hole that I cut for it this
represents if I like hot glued it in or
something okay that did not work so if
it works if you press like super deep
need to make the hole bigger there is
not that much time between now and when
fallout 4 comes out if anything goes
wrong I'm screwed I'm doing a lot of
things in this build that could
completely screw the entire build over
I hope this switch works all right guys
we're back in the office now one of the
problems with painting this is that the
surface is very different than the
surface of the bomb the service of the
bomb is super smooth this guy has flat
walls because it's a 3d printer and it
was printing kind of with some foot
walls so I need to sand that down so
it's a little bit more smooth this is
going to take a little while so super
speed time-lapse engage I'm just gonna
tie a shirt on my face okay so it's
largely sanded down
this is filler primer so hopefully that
will help kind of fill in some of the
grooves that are still existing and we
can get going one of the problems is is
that the clearances on these things are
actually pretty tight so I'm gonna try
to tape them off and then we'll be good
to start spray
I've never spray primered anything
before let's hope I don't super suck
that would be a huge waste of time
what do you think any problems
that's a lot smoother I can already tell
so we're gonna bring this in to try
again then we might do it one more time
so through the combined efforts of my
triangle file and my large flat file I
was able to open up that circular hole
that I had drilled and make a square
hole and the switch fit through I need
to secure it got some hot glue that
should be fine but there is one problem
that remains it has to be so far out
that I can't actually slide it in
because it will interfere with the rim
of the bomb so I have to actually take
it out and then put the switch plate
back in all the way and then fit it in
why this is a problem is I have to hot
glue it in a position that I can't take
it out and that sucks that's super
sketchy but anyways let's give it a shot
don't touch it yeah
that's pretty fast though thankfully
okay so everything's put together if it
doesn't work I'm gonna pull my freaking
hair out let's try it it made the noise
the computer turned on we're good to go
moving on to other things alright guys
this is primer coat number three it's
starting to come along we might do one
or two more
another problem to be solved the power
supply of this rig will be going into
the top of the bomb up here I need you
to be able to plug into it into the
bottom of the bomb so I need to create
an extension so I needed a right angle
connector with a favorable inlet so what
I did was I got a right angle cable and
I cut it in half without the camera
being turned on and then the plan is to
strip off the end of this splice out the
wire solder the wires into this guy
mount this guy into the bottom of the
case plug this into the power supply and
voila so here we go okay so connection
one is done just like my other jobs a
little sloppy but it'll do Wow that one
was like probably my best one okay so
electrical taped up my little thingy
that I soldered together here so
hopefully that looks better for one and
hopefully it works
that's what we're going to test now and
with a whole lot of hope and it works
a little worried what uh okay okay okay
okay moving on
all right all right this is our fourth
and final coat of primer then we have to
do a layer of black
so I spray-painted a bug onto the primer
okay so it's all primed we're ready to
start painting as with basically
everything else in this project I have
no idea what I'm doing but we're going
to start with black so this guy is black
I believe lioness does know what he's
doing when it comes to the paint stuff
but and he was supposed to show me but
he had to leave important business of
some sort or something or other whatever
so yeah he's not here so we're just
gonna wing it that's probably way more
black paint that I need but as I have no
idea we're going to go with that
now Linus said to roll down on this
thing towards the paint after dipping it
in the paint for two minutes but I'm
kind of assuming that he was
exaggerating a little bit because he
thought I would naturally do it I'm just
going to go for like a while
okay you have to look at things so I
just shoved two round B batteries inside
of the thing so that it wouldn't move
when I press pain on it and they fit
perfectly but so I think the two minutes
of squeezing the pain out of it was a
huge exaggeration oh my god why is this
so bad
and what is that pattern when you take
all the pain oh the brush you need a lot
of pressure behind it apparently so
that's why I didn't work right away
logitech has been in the headphone game
for a really long time and it shows with
the g6 33 Artemus spectrum headset the
g6 33 is equipped with Logitech's 40
millimeter Pro G oo D Oh drivers 7.1
Dolby surround sound with Logitech
Gaming software a cardioid boom mic
which hides away very nicely actually
fully adjustable RGB lighting and custom
tags they're available from a variety of
retailers now including Amazon will be a
great holiday gift for your PC Xbox or
ps4 gamers or just a great pickup for
yourself if you're looking for a new
headset check them out in the length of
video description down below ok so our
first coat of black is done honestly it
looks pretty ok there's definitely
definitely areas where it needs more
paint so we will definitely definitely
have to do another coat but for now
we're gonna let it dry so I'm going to
take it inside so there's a little bit
of a warmer climate at this time of
night in the unheated warehouse it's
like borderline too cold to even be
painting so I need to take it into the
office that I can actually kind of warm
up so that I can dry
okay
