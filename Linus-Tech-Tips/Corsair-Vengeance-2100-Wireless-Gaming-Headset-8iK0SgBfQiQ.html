more welcome to an unboxing and review
this is part 2 of our series of wireless
gaming headsets so this will be part 3
and this one right here is part 1 the a
50 from astro this is the Corsair
Vengeance 2100 now normally I don't
review gaming headsets because frankly I
don't really care about them
generally speaking from more of an
audiophile brand you can get something
for cheaper that sounds better and will
have comparable or better comfort and
build quality this is just a fact but
when we move into wireless products that
fact starts to change a little bit
because audiophile grade wireless
headphones are very very expensive so I
wanted to check out the wireless options
that are available there if nothing else
so the Vengeance 2100 from Corsair comes
with a USB receiver transmitter dongle
rather that can plug directly into a
port or it can plug into the little base
station that has an extension cable on
it and it comes with a USB two micro B
connector that is for charging the
headset itself in terms of the
construction and looks I really like the
idea of Corsairs headsets the industrial
design it feels quite solid and is a big
improvement in the solidity Department
over the previous generation Vengeance
mm things like the hinges have been
reinforced significantly in terms of the
weight it comes in at around 325 grams
making it almost exactly the same weight
as the SteelSeries H Wireless it does
feature dolby headphone virtual surround
and that is pretty much it you can
either have stereo over USB or you can
have Dolby over USB because there's no
base station there's no optical input or
anything like that so it's PC and Mac
and that's it so there's no consoles or
anything like that it has an integrated
non user replaceable battery so you just
plug that in and charge it just like
that and it does also have an integrated
volume wheel which I quite like it's got
a nice
old finish on it in terms of comfort the
weight is a little bit further out than
I would then I would necessarily like so
I find it jiggles a little bit and
unfortunately it doesn't fit me
particularly well it has okay clamping
force and in terms of the construction I
mean the foams a little bit on the hard
side but once it breaks in I would
expect it to be nice and comfortable for
me the problem is that at my head width
they don't angle in enough and I don't
quite get a seal at the bottom so so
they leak which is which is really
important for optimal fit as well as
optimal sound quality now with all of
that said with a longer break-in period
I would expect these to improve in a way
that I wouldn't expect from the astro a
50s as well as the SteelSeries age
Wireless because both of those come with
softer foam out of the box which I guess
is sort of one of the well do you want
the one that feels better out of the box
or the one that might wear out slower or
it's up to you
anyway for the range test I did my usual
range test which is from the office
having the base station installed I
stayed within the same room pass I went
to the other side of the wall about
eight feet away that was okay I went
down the hallway about 15 feet away that
was okay and then the 2100 s failed when
I went down to the stair landing so I
was quite far away and a wall as well as
in the bathroom in the basement so I
tried in five different locations the
max volume of the vengence 2100 sigh I
was noticeably discomfortable
discomfortable uncomfortable caused
discomfort I wouldn't want to listen to
them like that I actually found that 20
to 30% was plenty for day-to-day music
listening or casual gaming but what's
great about the 2100 s compared to the a
50s is that once I reached the maximum
volume on the my there's no distortion
they seem to be capped internally so
that you don't go so far that they sound
bad they always sounded good noise
isolation was a weak point of this
headset for me because they don't seal
correctly on my head but when I manually
adjust them I'd say they're about
they're about average for a closed back
headphone and that's about the best that
they can do because they do use a cloth
your cup a pleather ear cup will tend to
will tend to isolate better than cloth
although the benefit of cloth is of
course that
is a sweat absorption as opposed to
sweat causing the battery life is about
10 hours but the good news is you can
run while you're connected to a charger
so just like the 50s unfortunately
unlike the H wireless it doesn't have a
swappable battery so you can pretty much
go continuously the Vengeance 1500s are
fully driverless I was up and running in
about 15 seconds which is great there is
sort of rudimentary software thing that
you can install it's it's not fancy but
it's functional so you can control
surround as well as volume you can set
your mic listen functionality and you
can control your graphical EQ from
within there and that's pretty much all
there is to it the volume wheel is well
integrated into Windows and actually
controls your system volume as opposed
to just controlling an independent
volume on here whether you prefer that
or not is up to you I liked that the H
Wireless controlled its own volume
separately because they didn't really
get that loud so being able to play
around with the software and crank them
a little higher would be kind of nice
worse with the 2100 it doesn't matter
because they can get as loud as you
would definitely want pretty much now
when we move on to listening tests they
were all tested the same way that is to
say on both of the ones that accept
analog inputs I did use digital input so
I used usb on a PC for all three of them
and just for the best apples to apples
comparison and about the menus 2100 side
say that bass was actually pretty tight
without being overpowering it was quite
nice to listen to and they felt fairly
fairly flat a lot of gaming headsets
will tend to have pumped-up bass the a
50s we're guilty of this a little bit
and actually my personal favorite
example of expensive gaming headphones
that amp up the bass a lot the Razer
Kraken forged a lot of gaming headsets
tend to do that the Vengeance 2100 s
didn't I did find the highs were a bit
harsh to my ears at high volume but this
is normal for me with with reference
flat headphones so your mileage may vary
on that one and the mids were well
controlled as well overall I was pretty
impressed with the 2100 s especially
given that very 150 dollar wireless
headset for the mic I actually wasn't
that impressed with
this was the first one that I tried
though so once I tried the H Wireless
and the Astro a 50s high I consider it a
strong performer now I'll let you guys
listen now and make your own judgement
call here this is my test of the Corsair
Vengeance 2100 microphone I hope that
you have enjoyed it thoroughly with a
wireless headset a replacement mic
solution like a clip-on or a desktop
microphone is really not much of an
option so the built-in has to be
adequate and although I hate boom mics
and I really find them hard to position
just right and I feel like retractable
is the way to go
I got a give course there are full marks
especially now that I've more carefully
evaluated the competition for the
microphone solution on the Vengeance
2100 so whether or not this guy makes
sense it's going to come down to pretty
much one or two things so number one is
price it costs half as much as the other
two headsets in this round up half as
much at one hundred and fifty dollars
it's still quite expensive but at least
it sounds good and it costs half as much
as the other options but it lacks the
features of the other ones so the HP
Wireless has their sexy little base
station control thing with live mixing
between your chat volume and your game
volume it's got better comfort better
sound quality it has better range it has
console compatibility the 850 also has
console compatibility its God so I would
argue better comfort it's also it
doesn't have as good of a mic but it's
got the included stand and stuff like
that so these I would consider the
bare-bones value option for the strictly
PC gamer thank you for checking out this
review of the Corsair Vengeance 2100
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it I'd love to hear
from vengeance 2100 owners what do you
guys think of your headphone do you
think that it'll be the big winner in
this series of reviews or are you
