for any sort of extended period of time
you probably know that I'm a bit of an
audio geek so this is something that I
am extremely excited about this is the
brand new SP 2500 from Corsair it is
from their gaming audio series which
normally I would sort of turn my nose up
to and I'd say blog gaming audio that
just means it's not very good and so
they marketed to gamers who don't know
better no offense to any of our gamers
in the audience but Corsair has taken a
completely different approach to this
particular set of gaming audio speakers
this is a 2.1 set up and they have aimed
to build the best overall speaker setup
that they can in the price range that
gamers can still afford so why don't we
find one side of this box or other that
has some specifications on it that I can
show you and we'll go through what
course there has to say for themselves
about this setup so first thing over
here we see that Corsair has a 2 year
warranty on it
of course there's warranty is legendary
in this industry so you can pretty much
believe that they're going to stand
behind it for as long as they say
all right specifications frequency
responses from 35 Hertz to 20 kilohertz
plus or minus 3 decibels okay 220 watts
total power that is measured via FTC RMS
so that what is that root means squared
or something along those lines which
means that it can do this for days at a
time your speaker system not the one
that they've submitted for rating ok not
for two minutes at a time not for one
musical note at a time can do it for
days at a time
every single one all right subwoofer
dimensions satellite dimensions you can
read those if you want the subwoofer is
an 8-inch 120 watt subwoofer with
durable rubber surround okay so it's a
bridged dual 60 watt classic you have
bridge okay
so dual amplifier so this speaker system
actually uses a dual amp design which
means that you have one amp that drives
the larger speaker on your satellite and
then you have one amp that drives the
tweeter on
your satellites so I'll show you guys
that when I actually take it out of the
box you've got an ultra-efficient
integral power supply with universal
input so imagine that Corsair building
something with a good quality power
supply in it go figure
satellites are by amplified as I
mentioned before two-way design with
detachable audio cables 3-inch
40 watt mid-range drivers and one-inch
40 watt ferrofluid cooled silk diaphragm
tweeters so those are the ones that I
was mentioning before are independently
amplified 50 watts per satellite
measured via this method the reviewers
guide for this actually mentions this a
lot it is incredibly important because
you can build a 1,000 watt speaker setup
that basically just sounds like noise
because it's not because all the sound
is just being corrupted ok so PC input
on the subwoofer do ok you can read all
this if you want I suppose oh oh this is
kind of actually we'll talk about
headphone mouna devoted a bit mod X
theatrical audio processing for blu-ray
and DVD audio that recreates the theater
experience that's kind of neat ok so why
don't we go ahead and start getting this
out of the box and I am going to refer
to my cheat sheet here because the
reviewers guide is that long and it's
actually chock full of good information
I have read through it a couple times
but I cannot necessarily be expected to
remember every little thing every time I
am human sorry guys
ok so here in terms of included audio
cables we have one little headphone jack
straight pass-through okay then we have
two power cables so those are using
imagine that a PC company goes and uses
4 pin CPU power connectors ok and then
we have an RCA cable just like that ok
we have a power cord standard PC power
cord no it isn't look at that it's a 2
prong one so there's no ground on this
guy I guess you probably could use a
grounded cable it just wouldn't be good
to be grounding out via that third prong
so we're packed using environmentally
friendly how environmentally friendly
cardboard packaging love to see that I'm
just going to
start taking this stuff out here and
that is the subwoofer for that thing's
big oh here we go those documentation so
let's see what we have in terms of
documents that course they are going to
tell us how to use it so stop do not
return this to the store this is a
QuickStart guide so the QuickStart guide
is like this thick hopefully there are a
few different languages in there so they
show us what's in the box how to use the
desktop controller how to make all the
necessary connections here's some tips
for the best sound there's tip number
one use a high-quality sound card BAM so
yes please please do not forget to use a
high-quality sound card and there you go
that's the English part so it looks like
it's probably in about eight languages
or so some safety information which you
should read but I'm not going to because
I'm actually not plugging it in just yet
got some more packaging materials here
file that behind me something in here
okay this is what unboxing is all about
right guys having this experience so
here I've got a couple of speaker stands
I think is what these are but there's
only one way to find out for sure and
that is to just try things until
something fits okay so these have little
rubber feet on them so we'll go ahead
and put those aside for now and then we
have our control pod I'm a big fan of
control pods for desktop PC speaker
systems generally gives you a lot of
control this one actually has a bunch of
different modes that you can use in
order to optimize it for the kind of
content you're listening to you can turn
on the mod X mode which is great for
some movies etc you can actually turn on
a headphone mode which is optimized for
action believe it or not it's optimized
for low quality headphones because
Corsair like myself recognizes that most
of the gaming audio products out there
are just code name for low quality so
their headphone mode on their speakers
is actually designed to compensate for
low quality gaming headphones so check
that up
everything on this one so we'll go ahead
and take out one of the satellites here
I'll show you guys this there we are so
it's pretty heavy actually not like
super heavy like my caps at home but
feels feels built anyway it's a very
very plane look what we've pretty much
come to expect from Corsair so here we
are there's your power for the tweeter
your power for the mid-range and they
show you that this is the left speaker
so there's your power input and then
around on the other side we find not a
whole lot to speak of down on the bottom
we see four rubber feet and I'm let me
just see what these are difficult like
this that doesn't make any sense there's
the picture huh we'll figure these out
in a bit okay so there's one of the
tweeters or rotten one of the tweeters
one of the satellites rather so here
we'll grab the other one and then we'll
pull out all of this packing material so
we can get access to the stuff over I'll
never be able to pack this back together
thankfully I don't have to okay so
here's the sub and we'll go ahead and
move box make the camera net
and once I've got the whole thing on box
I'm actually going to take a little bit
of time and I'm going to go through my
cheat sheet with you guys and tell you
some of the more interesting things that
I learned about this speaker setup when
I was reading through it this is
different I had kind of expected this to
go from front to back a long way okay so
here is the front of our subwoofer you
can see you've got a nice little coarser
logo here you've got your port here okay
the overall finish is the like the the
rubberized sort of texture that we saw
before camera man's gone ahead and
putting his iPhone 4 on the subwoofer
for scale so that's how large the sub is
and actually why don't I go ahead and
put one of the satellites on there as
well just so you can see for comparison
what it will look like on your desk okay
so there's the iPhone so let's go ahead
and move around to the side go ahead and
show you guys what it looks like from
this side so very very very plain what
you'd expect from a quality piece of
audio equipment it shouldn't really
stand out it should be all about the
sound it makes not the appearance of it
so here you can see we've got our power
input over here on the left along with a
bunch of warnings and certifications and
all that good stuff then we have course
there's part number here and then we've
got all the business ends side of things
so we have our remote so that's the here
we go the control pod just plugs in like
this okay that's pretty straightforward
next we have our satellites power okay
so those plug in just like that they are
color-coded and it looks like yep they
only go in one way
so there's your right and then your left
goes in much the same way all right the
other connectivity we have down here is
our line in so you can see we have our
left and right and then an auxilary
input so that's pretty straightforward
and you can see that we have not only
the auxilary one here but we also have
our auxilary two input
the back of the control pod as well as a
USB connection so I'll be back in just a
minute so I'm totally going to cheat a
little bit because it's an awful lot to
remember there's lots of charts and
diagrams so we'll go through some of
this together but I'm going to show you
some of the stuff that Corsair has to
say for themselves in their reviewers
guide so I already mentioned the bio
amplified satellite speakers oh we did
find out what these are for so these are
stands you do want to ensure for the
best possible stereo experience that the
satellites are mostly pointed at you so
that means if you're sitting at a desk
and your desk is kind of below you you
would want to position these under the
front two feet of the speakers in order
to have them pointed more at your ears
and rather than at your chest so that is
the reason that they've gone ahead and
included that okay studio quality
digital crossovers so this is a good
thing to talk about a little bit I'll
let cameraman sort of check out the
speakers while I drone on over here oh
actually no first thing this has a 1.8
inch TFT colour display readable in
daylight or at night so I'll go ahead
and make sure that you rub so I'll go
ahead and make sure that I show you guys
what this looks like
and one of my follow up videos for this
the speaker set okay ah studio quality
digital crossovers so you know what I'd
really recommend going ahead and reading
one of the online reviews about this if
you want to read all of this but
basically what it means is that you are
going to have a more you're going to
have a much finer control over what part
of your audio signal gets played through
the subwoofer what part gets played
through the mid speakers and what part
gets played through the tweeters that's
pretty much what it means okay technical
overview they're basically saying that
their subwoofer uses a fourth-order
bandpass design rather than a simpler
ported bass reflex
did I say bass no I said bandpass good
rather than a simpler ported bass reflex
subwoofer so these two diagrams you know
what I'm not an audio engineer I don't
know the benefits of that design but
it's definitely worth mentioning to you
guys in case you do know the difference
they talked about
I don't know if they can see that so
they talk an awful lot about why using
the FTC standard for power output
matters and I'm going to summarize a
couple pages in the reviewers guide as
well it means that it can provide that
power over an extended period of time it
also means that that power is going to
be balanced between the different parts
of the speaker system because you could
buy a 500 watt speaker system that has a
450 watt subwoofer in 225 watt
satellites and it's going to provide a
very unsatisfactory listening experience
if you're doing anything other than
listening to explosions so that's why
that is important you have a late night
mode which I should have mentioned
before but what it does is it just
adjust the prosper crossover point so
that the satellites are going to play
more of your base than the subwoofer
which means that you're not going to
bother your neighbors late at night
headphone processing mode I mentioned
before the mod X processing is for
making it sound more like a theater and
courser really recommends there they're
not going to go ahead and say that yeah
this is the be-all and end-all it's that
simple they're just saying you have this
option you can try it out if you like it
great it'll sound great with certain
movies bad with others but that's fine
that's life they've given you a lot of
different modes to play with it also has
a karaoke mode which applies processing
that attempts to remove or significantly
reduce the vocals which is pretty neat
maybe I'll do like a karaoke video these
speakers to show off that particular
little feature and they've got a bunch
of other equalizer presets as well pop
jazz FPS app so let's talk about what
the SP 2500 is designed for it is
designed to be listened to a close range
so it's not really for your living room
it's for computer okay that's one thing
second of all it is designed to be used
with a sweet spot so if you have
multiple listeners this is not marketed
as you know a 360-degree field of
listening or anything like that it has a
sweet spot which really any speaker
system does and that is designed to be
right where your head is so that's why
they include the stands that's why they
include two speakers you aim them at
your head you want to create a sweet
spot you've got to play around a little
bit to find out where it is I won't
think the next
here is why doesn't it have a digital
input well it's completely unnecessary
so I think that covers pretty much
everything I want to save up the SP 2500
