We're hiring again!
Somehow, Colton talked me
not just out of firing him
but into hiring someone to help him!
Yes! We need another account manager over here at Linus Media Group.
This person needs to be able to make sales,
help manage brand relationships,
talk to people, assist the production team,
put up with me - that's probably the most difficult part - and just
generally be super organized
and freaking awesome to work with.
AND, yes, we actually need two people.
-Go!
-We are looking for primarily on the shooting side
preferably with side interests in lighting
- that one is priority number one -
and/or sound as some of you may or may not have noticed our sound is
not THE GREATEST.
-R.I.P headphone users.
Um, if they have any editing experience, that's a bonus too, we're always looking for unicorns.
So, both candidates have to have relevant experience
and be able to work in a fast-paced environment,
they need to possess strong communication skills
- you know all those things that are usually on job postings -
and they need to be able to multitask.
If you're applying, you must live in Canada or have a Canadian Work Permit
and you must be able to work out at our office in Surrey British Coumbia.
If you're interested, and you think you're the right fit,
please fill out the appropriate Google Form.
We're gonna have that linked below
Now I'm going to take this call because it's my wife and I am
half an hour late for where I'm supposed to be.
*Gasps*
I'm late for badminton! I totally forgot about it! I gotta go.
See? That's why we need more people.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
