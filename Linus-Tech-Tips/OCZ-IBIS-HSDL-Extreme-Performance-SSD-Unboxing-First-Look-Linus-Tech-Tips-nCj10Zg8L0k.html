like it's kind of like this product in
that respect it changes everything again
SSD technology is moving so fast that
it's almost impossible to keep up with
it so we started out with simple SSDs
two and a half inch drives I don't
honestly you know what performance
wasn't great it wasn't even really in a
lot of situations as good as a
traditional mechanical hard drive so
that's where we started then we got high
performance SSDs when intel released
their x.25 series in the links released
their bare foot controller and all of a
sudden SSD is whoa now they're
affordable now their way faster than a
hard drive then from there we got even
higher performance SSDs and now with the
San force controller the Intel gentoo
controller as well as crucial latest
controller we're running into the limits
of the say 23 gigabit per second
interface now crucial doesn't worry
about that so much because their SSD
actually uses seen a six gigabit per
second but say the six gigabit per
second isn't even really mainstream yet
and not everybody has a controller for
that so some companies are coming out
with some innovative solutions including
ocz but there r evo dr series of drum of
SSDs where they actually use a pci
express interface to plug in SSD
directly into your motherboard but
there's also another way so check this
out this is the ibis or in this i
actually don't know how to say it i'm
not going to worry too much about it
because the name is not the cool thing
the cool thing is this card right here
because the SSD isn't even polity but
it's not quite that neat and this is
what's important about it right there so
satyam there you go so stata is what are
they saying 1.5 no they're saying it's
13 gigabit per second ok and then SAS
SAS is up to about 6 gigabit per second
right now hsd L so that is I think it
stands for high speed data link or
something like that anyway this is
capable of almost 20 20 gigabit per
second so that means that we can take
four sandforce controllers remember
sandforce controller is
most able to max out a sada three
gigabit per second connection we can
take up to four of those at a time plug
them in with the HS dl cable directly
into our HS dl card and we can get just
unheard of performance so let's go ahead
and open up the box on OCC's
cutting-edge high-speed data link hey I
got it right interface and it is the
answer to the Santa bottleneck and the
driving force behind the Ibis SSD so the
SSD runs off of internal raid 0 so
that's how they're able to take 4
controllers so that is force and force
controllers they put them all together
just see if I can get this opened up
here my SSD is faster than your hard
drive darn right it is this SSD is
faster than a good number of hard drives
together I'll tell you that much so
there it is that is the Ibis HS DL three
and a half inch solid state drive so you
can see on the side we have your
standard three and a half inch mounting
holes this is your standard three and a
half inch form factor we have your
standard three and a half inch mounting
holes on the back on the bottom rather
standard three and a half inch mounting
holes on the other side we have a QC
pass so that means that it did pass the
QC and on the back we have a step oh we
have a standard bloody well nothing
actually no we do actually we have a
standard say to say to power okay so you
can actually power this with your normal
power supply and then we have an H sdl
connection right there so it actually
looks kind of like an sss 8087 cable in
fact I think it uses one but that's
definitely like not a that's a
non-standard pin out for sure okay so
you plug that baby right in there that's
nice and that is the equivalent of
several SATA 6 gigabit per second
connections so you go ahead you comes
with a nice little sleeved cable here
you can see the individual wires inside
there they're kind of silvery and look
all nice okay and then you go ahead and
plug that
I into this little card right here and
this is where the magic happens because
this card is a controller card now you
can buy an ide controller you can buy a
SATA controller you can buy a SAS
controller or if you want to oh I
dropped it Wow okay or if you want to
have the most cutting edge performance
possible you can buy this controller so
here it is it looks real simple doesn't
it basically what they're doing is
they're taking a PCI Express 4x
interface they're using the simplest
possible card as you can clearly see to
deliver as much of that performance as
possible directly into your SSD Drive so
you just go ahead remove the little
stopper right there the stopper the you
unplug the top of the bottom that
unleashes the power the power so you go
ahead use one of your PCI Express 4x or
higher remember you can plug this into
an 8x or a 16 X connector on your
motherboard plug that in like that run
that drive wherever the heck you feel
like it and boom you have performance
that is untouchable with any other
solution on the market at this time and
probably for a while although the hook
the way SSD / the way SSD performance is
increasing like every time stop and take
a breath who knows when is coming down
the line now I just want to see the
overall specs and nice so max
performances reads up to seven hundred
and forty megabytes per second with
writes up to 690 megabytes per second
and with up to 100,000 4k random right I
ops holy smokes thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the OC
see if this ibis hopefully someone can
correct me on that as well as their HS
dl interface card don't forget to
