the Isuzu play air so this air version
the biggest most obvious upgrade they've
made to it is where the air name comes
from and that is that they have added
wireless support to the older isuzu play
so that let's have a quick look at the
Box here you can see right there they've
called it on the front wireless that is
the big feature okay but let's have a
look at the features that they list on
the side so if I can get the cameraman
to have a look you can see where we've
got full support for most of your
important HD movie film formats you have
support for photos now as well as a
bunch of different audio and subtitle
formats okay they have a look at the
unit itself multiple format support blah
blah blah eSATA is present it now has a
card reader which is another cool
feature and then here we've got easy
wireless file sharing complete card
reader support to share photos on TV
large screen with your family and
friends as well as Oh photo picture
manager to organize your pictures by
date folder okay so let's open up the
box it's on here oh okay there goes a
liner piece so you got a slick black box
and let's just take out the Oh play air
itself and have a look at the
accessories first so you can see we've
got a pretty good accessory package
let's see what we've got
first of all you will find a media
remote that looks kind of like a short
and if you've seen the OEM Microsoft
remote it looks kind of like a shortened
version of that with no number pad so
that is here it will play remote and
they've been kind enough to include a
couple of triple-a batteries for you
awesome okay then we have composite
cable alright if you're using an HD
player they'll try to avoid using this
because yeah you're not gonna get the
best you're not gonna better get the
best possible quality out of it then
you've got a power cord a power brick as
well as an oak play HD media player user
manual as well as the O link network
connection utility okay and then inside
we have an O play HD media player Quick
Start Guide so this is going to give you
a general overview of what all of the
different connections are as well as the
remote control button and Wow then they
basically show you how to plug it into
your TV so the setup better be
easy otherwise people are going to have
trouble with that so let's take out the
old plate air itself and have a quick
look at the box okay so it's not
particularly large by these mediaplayer
standards a little bit bigger than a WD
TV or WD TV live but it's obviously much
smaller than a popcorn hour so let's
just take this plastic cover off you can
see it's got a very nice glossy finish
to the go away to the asou slow go on
the top and then the rest is on that
like a matte black that will fit in very
nicely with other media devices and then
the front is a glossy black finish as
well as the side and the other side you
can see a little air ventilation holes
up at the top here because I mean you're
you've got a 1080p video processing unit
inside so you are going to need a little
bit of ventilation for it so this side
is where you'll find the card reader so
you can see we've got support for
contact flash SD as well as memory stick
and memory stick duo
and then on the other side we have
support for USB as well as eSATA and
that's where you'll find a little
hardware reset switch should you need to
reset the device if it locks up and then
on the back that's where we'll find most
of the guts so you can see all we've got
here is composite so if you're using
analog you're using composite period and
then we have HDMI as well as optical
audio out so that is your digital
connection so they haven't given a whole
lot of connection options but this
should service most of the people out
there then you've got a LAN port if you
don't want to use the wireless as well
as a power plug the bottom of the unit
has four little rubber feet and thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
product overview overview of the asou so
play air</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
