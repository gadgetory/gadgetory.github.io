the Intel Sandy Bridge did I say Sandy
Bridge because what I meant to say was
Ivy Bridge line up so I don't have the
whole line up here today but let's go
over the general information about all
of them first so at launch these are all
77 watt TDB processors what that means
is that they actually produce less heat
in terms of their spec at stock speeds
then the last generation Sandy Bridge
processors which were all 95 watt TDP
processors what is also cool about these
guys is the fact that they are all using
Intel's new 22 nanometer manufacturing
process that means more transistors in
less space which basically means two
things either cost savings for Intel
which isn't of much concern to consumers
what do we care what Intel saves their
cost on but number two but wait there's
more is and on the flipside of cost
savings is that they can also not save
the cost but jamming more performance so
this is a small upgrade to the
architecture so they haven't jammed in
too much more CPU performance although
they've jammed in a heck of a lot more
integrated graphics performance but they
have put in a little bit more
performance and they're not charging any
more for it and they do run cooler and
yeah pretty much it's Ivy Bridge so
let's go over the general line up before
we unbox one so these are apparently in
some kind of an order are they already
ok but I would put them like this way to
go slick ok and let's start over here so
this is an i-5 that means it is still
quad-core ok so back in the back in the
Linfield days i-5 pretty much meant
dual-core if I recall correctly
no it didn't I'm wrong nevermind I
didn't go there ok so this is the i-5
which means it does not have hyper
threading so it is 4 cores and four
cores only it's a 34 50 so the 34
indicates like lower general frequency
performance and the 50 means that it has
Intel HD graphics 2500 from my testing
HD graphics 2500 are approximately
equivalent to the last generation Sandy
Bridge HD 3000 so
is the higher end graphics from the last
generation is now equivalent to the
lower end graphics okay we have turbo
boost technology 2.0 which basically
means that if you're using fewer threads
that is you're running a game that's
only single or dual threaded and you got
four quarters in here it will go ahead
and wrap up the frequency as long as
you're cooling and and your power
limitations think it's up basically it's
okay it'll do it supports dual channel
ddr3 memory through your warranty
integrated memory controller and smart
cache technology okay most of those are
not that relevant beyond just it goes
like really fast that's what all of that
means okay next we've got the i-5 35 70
K so 35 means it's like better than a 34
and then an i-5 means it like also
doesn't have hyper threading and the K
that's where oh no hold on the seventy
means it has HD 4000 graphics which are
significantly faster than 3000 and 2500
graphics but still not as fast as AMD's
apu so it's something like a 38 70 K
when it comes to DirectX 11 games
although it is DirectX 11 ready and
there is a benefit benefit okay so HD
4000 graphics the benefit it has over
2500 and basically anything else is that
it just destroys every other method of
quickly transcoding videos so if you
want to take like a folder full of
videos that you ripped off of your DVD
that you bought of some show that you
like like you know Grey's Anatomy for
example what you do is you just queue up
oh don't give me that look you queue up
all the videos to and to convert them to
a format that is more acceptable for
your given device so for example if you
have an iPhone all you do is you use
arcsoft media converter seven you say
output to iPhone and then you give it a
folder down put to and you click go and
then you tell it to use Intel's Smart
Response technology no that's the sorry
that's the other one of the SSDs quick
sync use Intel Quick Sync and what it
does is it does it in like half of the
time of any other solution so using all
four dedicated CPU cores is still slower
than using that integrated graphics okay
so Indy's apu does not do that but it it
does sort of beat it in DirectX 11
gaming but
this to me anyway is sort of more useful
because I don't really use onboard
graphics anywho right so this is uh
everything's all out of order now this
was over here right over here okay so
the cake ah the cake
means it's unlocked unlocked and
unleashed that means you basically
overclock it as much as you want most
accurate processors from their stock
frequencies of around three point and
change are good up to in excess of 4.5
gigahertz however when you overclock an
Ivy Bridge processor what you will
notice is that it gets pretty hot so
you're gonna want a pretty beefy cooler
to go with your Ivy Bridge processor
let's go ahead and move along so this is
nice seven thirty seven seventy which
means it has beefy graphics it's like
more better than this one cuz it's 37 is
235 and is nice seven that means it has
hyper-threading so that means it has 4
physical cores and 8 virtual overall
course including 4 virtual cores a for
physical for virtual for eight total
threads on this particular processor
this is not a K which means you
basically can overclock it which means I
mean in my personal opinion as an
overclocker pretty much don't waste your
money spend an extra couple bucks and go
with this guy so this is the king of the
castle when it comes to Ivy Bridge it's
an i7 hyper-threading it's a 37 which
means like more of the better than
everything else it is a 70 which means
you have fast video encoding and it is a
K which means you can overclock it quite
easily to an excess of 4.6 gigahertz
which is what I'm running on my test
bench it also has that house 8 Meg's a
cache cool I didn't even realize the I
fives only have 6 makes of cache
you learn something every day don't you
look at that stuff right on the box each
makes of cache 6 makes of cache cope so
why don't we do for our unboxing the
3770k since that is the hot skew that
everyone and their dog is like super
interested in ok it doesn't come with a
plaster of Paris heatsink in the box and
no CPU at all
wink wink if you guys know what I'm not
but I'm referring to
I'm sure it won't because this one came
from NCIX where most of the CPUs that
they sell our real CPUs and not native
yeah plaster ok
inside we find a CPU this has 1155 pads
on the back which correspond to 1155
pins and your z77 z68 or even p67
motherboard assuming your motherboard
manufacturer goes ahead and updates the
bios for you it comes with a sticker
with shiny as well as a three year
limited warranty Intel logo and
installation instructions guide booklet
front opens
basically pretty dry and it comes with a
stock cooler which I would pretty much
recommend that you hold on do we have a
garbage can that I can like totally go
for like an epic jump shot into okay
whatever especially if you're
overclocking I would definitely
recommend something more along these
lines or like these lines there's like
bolts and stuff okay these lines this is
intel's cooler which is pretty beastly
and pretty cool and yeah because Ivy
Bridge does get pretty toasty and does
does draw more power once you've
overclocked it so I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for checking
out my Ivy Bridge unboxing however late
it may have been and don't forget to
