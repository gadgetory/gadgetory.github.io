for quite a while and the the babies
have started to really shoot up so
they're playing on their homemade cat
tree still or at least one of them is
they only sort of have names at this
point so this one because he doesn't
have a stripe right here on his body
that's rocket ok Oh just tripped over
Rumble so named because he is incredibly
loud when he's purring and it's it
doesn't take much to get him going so
you can see from the stripe on his body
right here that is Rumble he also has a
nicer it has nicer stripes on his tail
which makes them easy to recognize from
the back
I haven't actually showed any close-up
videos of these guys I only showed a
couple videos of them sort of scrapping
with each other which it looks like
they're about to do now as soon as they
get attention they just sort of get
wired and go nuts they're like kids
hey you oh now he's attacking the camera
so he's got these beautiful spots on his
belly which I would love to show you if
he wasn't busy attacking my arm which
never takes long after I after I touch
it
ok so now you're up now what are you
gonna do now what are you gonna do well
you're going to keep attacking what you
go up there make a baby ok so maybe I
can get them going with the laser
pointer here yeah that's not that
difficult you're going to jump
their egos you're going to go chase it
inside Oh find a different way so now
maybe I'll get him to go out on the
Dalton here there he goes and chase it
down there you go now his brother wants
to get involved in the chase and chase
stop see if we can get him to go they
like the red laser pointer a lot more
than they like the green one even though
the green one was actually the expensive
one when I when I bought them for lunch
see if I can get him to climb up to the
top to demonstrate his exceptional
climbing skills they've aah both got a
very unique cooing purr that I don't
know if you've heard throughout the
video or not but it's very very
different okay well oh and I apologize
for getting their litter box involved in
the shot here that's their backup litter
box they're visiting me in the computer
room right now okay well I think that
pretty much does it for the cat video so
when I just get one more close for these
guys hey babies</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
