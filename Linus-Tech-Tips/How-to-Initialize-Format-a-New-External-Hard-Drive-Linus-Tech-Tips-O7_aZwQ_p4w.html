inspired to make because one of my
friends bought a standalone hard drive
and then an enclosure for it and unlike
the pre-done external hard drives like
you know the ones from WD that looked
like this over here unlike those these
drives when you buy a bear drive it
doesn't necessarily come formatted so
rather than walking through it on the
phone I decided to just make a video
about how to initialize a brand new
drive on your computer once you've
plugged it in so I've taken a bear drive
here and yes that is not the most static
safe way to do this but I've done it so
I plugged it in via SATA or power and
SATA data and I'm powering it up with
this power supply that's jumpered
totally ghetto set up but whatever and
I'm gonna show you guys the steps that
are required in order to get your new
hard drive recognized by your computer
so the first thing you're gonna do is go
to my computer and not only on your
desktop if you're running Windows XP and
you're gonna go to properties then
you're gonna go to the device manager
and scan for hardware changes so when
you scan for hardware changes I've
already done this but it'll it'll bring
up your drive so in this case we're
running a CA 2 terabyte ata device ok so
that's done the next thing you have to
do is right-click on computer and click
on manage so when you manage the
computer you want to go to the disk
management in particular and you're
going to then see aha this message now
if this message doesn't show up then
you're gonna want to scan down down down
until you find a not initialized Drive
you right click on the unallocated space
or rather you right-click on the not
initialize to drive and you click
initialize disk select disk ok Master
Boot Record is correct so ok it takes
just a moment to initialize the disk but
you're going to see that in my computer
that 2 terabyte drive is still not
showing up so what I have to do now is I
take that unallocated
space and I create a new simple volume
next I want all of it I'm going to
assign the drive letter X for extreme
and then I don't want a label because
the label is annoying
and next finish so that'll take just a
moment to format and then the computer
will detect the drive local disk x2
terabytes and we are done and now now
that I've initialized the disk and
formatted it
remember these come initialized and
formatted so that's this only applies to
a bare disk I can actually unplug it but
I'm going to do okay so I've unplugged
it now if i refresh this it goes away
eventually hold on I can make it go away
device manager action scan for hardware
changes
okay well then either way I just showed
you how to initialize and format your
new Drive aha there disappeared okay
we're good we're good so it disappeared
now and then when I take it and I plug
it back in you don't have to watch this
part it's okay it will not need me to
perform this process again now this
applies for USB drives firewire drives
eSATA drives internal SATA drives etc
etc etc although US drives are
automatically plug in place so you won't
need to do that device manager bit there
you go it's here it's ready to go thank
