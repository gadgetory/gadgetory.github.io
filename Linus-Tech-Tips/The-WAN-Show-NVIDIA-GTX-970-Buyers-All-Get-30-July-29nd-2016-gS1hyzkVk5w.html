now lawsuit the lawsuit show yeah
there's gonna be some lawsuit topics
today no one is suing us for being laid
all the time you know no false
advertisers gonna say is that how long
we're when we're gonna go live it's at
false advertising if you're just
actually a failure um I don't know I
mean this is starting to sound like sort
of Kickstarter territory but can you get
sued for being terrible at life maybe it
depends not a clear answer um however
you can get sued for saying a graphics
card has four gigs of memory if it does
indeed have four gigs of memory but in
fact an eighth of it runs at a lower
speed so NVIDIA has settled the graphics
card false advertising class action
Microsoft also faces two new lawsuits
over their aggressive Windows 10 upgrade
tactics are you're gonna do two of them
or am I gonna do no more I'll do two
more
Verizon buys Yahoo for four point eight
three billion it's too bad they spent so
much on it because I was gonna make a
play for Yahoo a with my you know maybe
forty bucks yeah that I got in my wallet
that might not be worth it that I was
gonna be a tough call but without that
forty bucks how would I go play
badminton tonight that or you could buy
20 cans of pop and 20 talking bears and
I could feel really terrible in the next
day which is about how I'd feel if I
bought Yahoo also using a VPN in the
United Arab Emirates could get you find
it could make you feel pretty bad
speaking of feeling bad out I almost
missed that segue I could get you find
up to five hundred and forty five
thousand US dollars so let's run the
intro which is the only thing that I
wasn't a hundred percent sure if it was
going to work today
see are you good I'm not sure
gosh a club okay
Oh oh I forgot to do one thing I forgot
to do a there boom now it'll work next
time okay nice oh yeah oh oh there's an
option to reset the scene every time you
left it uh no that that that is oh well
like we said all the scene oh you could
save what the scene was like every time
it would be very specifically useful for
us for that one scene I don't know that
xsplit will implement that but we've
asked for features before and they've
done it so yes alright so guys with it
is with a glad a glad heart that I can
reveal that I have finally resolved all
the issues that I had with the streaming
setup here we are using the razor siren
Pro which for whatever you guys always
complain that the audio was too quiet
and I think part of the problem is that
we're using microphones with a cardioid
pickup pattern as two people and so we
couldn't turn them up high enough
without introducing distortion siren Pro
works well for some reason in this
application I don't know why the other
thing is that we had a mishmash of
capture cards from El Gato avermedia and
Blackmagic including cards from their
deck link as well as their intensity
lineup it seemed like from week to week
one or the other could be responsible
for everything being completely bummed
up we are now consolidated we are using
all Epiphone capture cards a combination
of them and we actually have more input
devices now so I can do this with
Linus's screen or I can do this with
lick screen so we can both screen share
now also this is a really funny bug that
I hey we can prove that we're watching
the show now oh yeah that's cuz people
will see the chat on my screen um ah so
this is a really funny bug that I was
having with the elgato card was where it
would take like eight seconds to switch
scenes so I would bring out the I would
bring up the article that we were
talking about and it would be sitting
there and I wouldn't be able to change
to my notes on it and I would always
just have to kind of kill ten seconds
after I clicked
yeah so uh yeah this is a pretty
interesting article that I'm planning to
talk to you about but I don't have any
my exact notes here's some kind of you
know a thing that I okay yeah blah blah
blah here's what's going on yeah so
we're pretty much solved as far as
issues go I'm super thrilled and yes I
got a sunburn thank you for making that
observation I also got a spray tan yeah
on the same day that I went out and got
a sudden are you sunburned on your face
oh yeah oh my face is like wicked burnt
like yeah I don't think my face is great
well you were wearing a bucket yeah yeah
I did everything I could possibly do to
not get sunburned and I'm playing a
bucket on my head and like putting my
shirt on every opportunity I have I
don't even know how much of this is
spray tan Oh burn it's so hard to figure
it out or burned yeah I actually and
this was really hard but I went home had
a shower and like scrubbed because I was
trying to get spray tan off so I
scrubbed a sunburn when I got home from
the shoot yesterday should we just give
it a little bit but I'm not burnt as bad
should we tell them what we were
shooting and why your beard is shaved
why I have a thumb how long till it's
gonna be coming out that's gonna be at
least two or three weeks but should we
should we tease it anyway maybe we
should tease it anyway I think so I kind
of think can we show the original I
think we should tease it anyway I don't
want to show the original and get the
monetization pulled off when show
because that'll probably happen okay but
we did as close as we could a
shot-for-shot reenactment of the
volleyball scene from Top Gun now mind
you none of us are shredded enough for
it except for maybe Linus but okay the
funny thing about okay so we're talking
body fat percentage yeah when you say
sort of shredded in there isn't that
what that means no because I'm I'm not
like I'm not bulky enough but you look
shredded that's what it's all is that
what you could be jacked as but
have too high of a body fat percentage
to not look shredded oh I see okay well
so okay fine I might be shredded enough
but I'm just not bulky enough
like in the pictures he is tankers
bulkier there he's bulkier there for
sure I kind of wanna I kind of want to
tweet this right now or something so
that I saw there's a picture of me with
okay I'll just op even Terran okay
there's a picture of me with all three
of the other guys that are that are
doing the volleyball game and I look
tiny
I look like even though even again like
even though my body fat percentage is
quite low
I look like the Pinterest dude next to
Burkle who I'm pretty sure has four arms
bigger than my biceps I think well yeah
because I think my forearm might be
bigger than your vice yeah I think so
and so between the two versions like
massive yeah Merkel's chest is like huge
probably benchpress like by itself yeah
if you give it a probably bench with his
pecs yeah my entire body weight but like
not using his arms and Terran in the
time I've known him has it completely
changed has like he was like the
stereotypical don't take this the wrong
way but he still has no athletic
athletic ability so he can't use history
he's quite strong now but he was like
the stereotypical vegetarian and I don't
I don't mean that rudely in any way you
know vegetarian guys are super Jack
hitters there are lots of jack
vegetarians but it's like the vegetarian
from like the Dilbert comic like the
caricature of a vegetarian super like to
the T stereotypical one yeah like the
stereotypical vegetarian the guy was
like you know six or seven inches taller
than me and weighed about the same as I
did it was bad he's been very
intentionally putting on weight yeah and
very intentionally working he looks good
he looks good anyway so so I play Tom
Cruise maverick some of you have
probably seen Terrans picture on social
media where he shaved oh man the pedo
stache is far too real actually I'm
gonna pull this up it's gone now and
that's probably a good thing it's gone
now yeah you shaved you off oh oh he
shaved the pedo stach oh yeah yeah yeah
that's fine no I thought you meant his
no no that's cool no I'm pretty sure I'm
pretty sure you tweeted a picture here
where's where's
- where's Petros - no I don't see it I
don't see no maybe you didn't matter to
you maybe he tweeted on the ltte handle
I didn't put mine on the LTTE one
because it's a CSF thing it's not yeah
that's the same reason I didn't tweet
anything yesterday okay oh I can't find
ah ah I feel like terrible right now
like I really wanna okay whatever you
guys no no it's okay it's ridiculous so
Terrence goose okay so what's your
character's name Iceman
Iceman Iceman berkel is is it slider
something no I don't remember anyway
Luke and Burkle are like the like mean
rivals and then Taryn and I play Tom
Cruise and and goose and it's just bad
the twist is that we use an inflatable
volleyball that's like this big it
should be good it should be good stay
tuned stay tuned I'm not making it sound
very good but maybe okay I think his
name is either stinger Viper gesture or
Merlin I'm not sure which one I am
Iceman your Iceman all right I said
goose and maverick were crows all right
so let's move on to some actual news
topics here shall we the original
article here is from top class actions
dot-com and Vidya settles graphics card
false advertising class action so
they've agreed to a preliminary
settlement that will resolve claims in a
group of proposed class-action lawsuits
that center around allegations that the
company misled consumers about the
performance and quote unquote storage
capabilities of its product though it
should be noted that I wouldn't call
vram storage I already I posted that I
wouldn't call vram storage and sort of
the strictest sense of the word NVIDIA
says then that it will pay every buyer
of a GTX 970 $30 and they will pay 1.3
million dollars in additional and
additional I
additional attorneys fees so there you
go we had talked about this at the time
we had said we felt like a class action
was going to be pointless what are you
gonna get five bucks you know what
thirty dollars is decent thirty dollars
buys you a nappy and an entree but not a
drink at a restaurant and I just order
waters yeah I drink water - that's a
good like big probably gonna take some
home meal yeah that's right nice that's
right that's gonna be your dinner in
your midnight snack yeah while you're
gaming
yeah and your GTX 970 which is still a
very good card yep
so you know I weave again I don't want
to beat this dead horse any more than we
already have
you know like pure ghost loads out of
that horse at this point but the 970 is
still a good card they shouldn't have
done that
no I think they deserved this yeah
definitely yeah I don't think it's gonna
work because I thought they were gonna
get away with in the legal court like
there's technically four there and there
are like and there are that's the funny
thing about it is they it is misleading
I deserve it I can't imagine they saved
a lot of money building the card this
way I don't I don't feel like it would
be 30 bucks a card it because they did
put four gigs of RAM on it like they big
they bought the memory think they put it
on there so they actually had to pay for
the memory and then they had to pay on
crap payout to their customers as though
they didn't so now yeah I don't know
lesson learned right don't don't screw
with the Internet
so the overall settlement amount was not
publicly disclosed within the court
papers table couldn't be a lot but
Nvidia did say that there would be no
cap on the total amount it would pay and
they would pay all consumers who
purchased a 970 graphics card I guess I
don't count because minor review samples
that'd be pretty sick though if we could
turn our 970 for 30 bucks go get some
dinner smadi's
pretty sweet I mean with the amount that
we had you good I think we had that many
nine seventies at least - yeah we had
and it's US dollars so like oh dang yeah
yeah $600
that is pretty sweet though and I'm
happy that it happened this quickly I
know some people are gonna be like Oh
like this happened forever ago but these
things sometimes take like what was it
ddr2 or something there was some like
$15 rebate or $20 rebate on ddr2
purchases
oh I don't and it happened like 10 years
later yes there was an Intel one that it
was like six or seven years down the
line everyone got 15 bucks or ten but
yeah thirty bucks is I feel a pretty
good amount of money and it happened
relatively recently afterwards I was
think it was the right thing for Nvidia
to just settle it cuz that's why it got
done so quickly was that they settled it
rather than dragging this out into a
really long court battle I mean to be
clear I don't think they'd have settled
it if they thought they could win it
back yeah I write there's no form up yet
to like apply to get your thirty dollars
just in case anyone's like scrambling
trying to get their money
I think this top class actions website
is gonna post something about it once
it's up so they're trying to get you to
sign up for their newsletter I would
probably just come back to this website
instead of signing up for the newsletter
so basically there were a total of 15
consumer class-action lawsuits that were
consolidated in Northern California
Nvidia denied all allegations of
wrongdoing and then entered into the
settlement terms and and agreed to the
terms of the settlement and then the $30
is not arbitrary it's calculated to
represent a portion of the cost of the
storage and performance capabilities the
consumer thought it was the consumers
thought they were obtaining when they
purchased the card which what that's
like around like 11 percent of the car
something like that so pretty pretty
more than fair is what I would call that
cool
speaking of although there's something
to be said for like you think you buy a
product and you don't get that and it
wasn't even necessarily as much about
the money right so you should probably
get more than the difference which is
probably what happened but I don't think
that's usually how these things work I
no idea so nope alright let's move on to
our next topic here another lawsuit
topic the original article here is from
extreme tech I'm gonna pull this up you
wanna post it yeah all right Microsoft
slapped with class-action lawsuits over
Windows 10 upgrade practice good job so
they're facing two more lawsuits over
company over there questionable upgrade
tactics both suits are seeking
class-action status the first one was
filed in the US District Court of
Florida and alleges that the Microsoft
Windows 10 upgrade prompts violated laws
governing unsolicited electronic
advertisements which is a really
interesting way of tackling it because
you could sort of make the argument that
this is this is kind of getting into a
pretty fuzzy area here you could sort of
make the argument that let's say Apple
putting in iTunes update notification in
the bottom of your screen all the time
is like is like advertising impressions
because they're showing you that Apple
name and the iTunes name and and and
their or like if they had like a logo or
something in there like you could you
could almost take it one step further
and go but then it's like ting within a
brand name on something is that
advertising then if it's unsolicited
because the Windows 10 one was an entire
window that popped up on yours it wasn't
like a notification in the corner it was
like hey upgrade to Windows 10 and it
did it all the time and would do it
forcefully okay but hold on a second so
so I so yes
they basically put a billboard on your
computer that is different yeah but they
weren't trying to sell you anything
however in this day and age so much
software is free to play that
is there really a difference between an
ad for installing the Twitter app for
example and an ad for installing Windows
10 if Microsoft was making the argument
that Windows 10 was Windows 8.1 Service
Pack 4 or something like if they just
kind of said okay ah yes it's a service
pack that makes everything look the same
and oh by the way we're gonna call it
Windows 10 now like if they weren't
calling it a different product they
might have gotten away with this not
being called advertising but if they are
effectively trying to get you to
download and install a product from what
you have then I actually I kind of see
that holding water yeah and the length
to how I grow they went about it mm-hmm
all right so the second suit this is
more along the lines of what I expected
from Windows 10 class-action lawsuits so
this one alleges that Microsoft
installed Windows 10 on users computers
without consent and they've already paid
out ten thousand dollars in a previous
u.s. suit over similar circumstances and
this is a case where because it's a
Windows operating system and not part of
video memory that still functioned but
just like wasn't what I thought I was
getting this one I can see people
getting significant payouts for being
put out by this situation where their
computer doesn't work or their computer
doesn't work the way they expect it I
mean which I hope that happens because
I'd like to receive some money for the
like half a day that I lost because of
that I mean and it could be a lot worse
than that it could be you know I know
but it's only not worse than that
because it was me yeah like if I was my
system is set up that it's not that big
of a deal like if it's your you know I'm
not gonna say your mom cuz your mom's
fairly tech savvy if I recall correctly
she's like she wouldn't not be able to
find the control panel because you
changed the version of Windows would she
or like not able to find her programs
would know to look for the control pack
okay like would she not be able to find
her place to find her or like her
Internet Explorer yeah so let's talk
about if it's someone who legitimately
wouldn't be able to use their computer
even if the upgrade works correctly
there's gonna be people saying I think
my mom would be fine yeah there's gonna
be people out there though that would
have not been able to use their computer
for potentially weeks I guarantee my mom
would call me and be like everything
looks different I'm scared and on top of
that would have had to take it to a shop
to have it restored to pre Windows 10
upgrade they could be paying a lot of
money per instance in the case of that
$10,000 when they ended up buying her a
new computer if I recall correctly it
was a new laptop which i think is
unjustified personally but I think
they're very much just trying to get it
to go in but with that said the
paperwork involved in having a computer
serviced by some shop somewhere like
building us a service network
countrywide and remember people could
have been getting Windows 10 upgrades in
the middle of Timbuk freaking to
Kentucky like it could be easier to just
ship them a computer from delcom yeah
which is kind of terrifying all right so
I'm upset about that kind of stuff and I
wish that like I don't know it's it's
frustrating and frustrating that it will
also wasn't easier because like I'm
trying to build some land rigs right now
but like I don't have enough cases and
I'm trying to like get cases essentially
for free so there's been like delays on
it and whatnot so I haven't built all of
them yet I've got the couple of them but
that means there's a few of them that I
haven't done operating system installs
on yet so I guess they're just gonna
stay on Windows 7 because I have keys
for that I don't have keys for Windows
10 and I don't really want to buy more
operating system keys for land rigs that
don't need it right everyone can run
dx11
that's fine because dx12 is kind of
booked at the moment anyways yeah you're
working on a video about that right
trying to yes trying to you believe it
that there are certain reasons why I am
NOT currently able to complete it
they're making me frustrated but I'll
stay away from that I should
I think I'm getting the rest of the
information that I want on August 4th
but that I'm leaving for a while on
August 5th so it's probably gonna be a
bit yeah but yes there's a video on
Vulcan the current state of Vulcan and
dx12 that is all the way so Microsoft
told The Seattle Times that it believes
these suits won't succeed although I
mean they have to say that what else are
they gonna say it one quick thing that I
want to interject so when the chat said
and Vulcan succeeds you won't need
Windows 10 or DX 12 that's a good point
Vulcan works on like everything Android
Linux that's true assuming that it gates
there's only four games that more
supports right now yeah one of them is
dota so doesn't matter no but let no
dota is a very important game but it's
very easy to run and you don't need like
oh I thought you meant specific no no no
dota is a very important game I didn't
mean dota doesn't matter I mean it like
it being featured in DotA
the cool part of that mean it means that
it's very like you can play it on
whatever you want that part is cool cuz
Vulcan is on everything right okay
context of that got a little weird sorry
I was like wow so much hate no no so
much salt it did not mean that at all so
it is important game they've done a
really good thing for eSports
I like how they do their tournaments I
just realized that the only the most
loyal of our viewers are watching right
now oh you didn't because it didn't it
didn't push oh my oh that's okay
there's a couple more things on that
topic Microsoft getting rekt yeah yeah
basically then what their statement it's
still over Microsoft stated Microsoft's
marketing scheme falls short of certain
protections which must be afforded wait
what okay I was okay so basically
they said that upgrades to Windows 10
are a choice not a requirement which is
one way of putting it I guess and that
they offer free customer support to
those that run into trouble have you
ever tried to contact Microsoft customer
sorry the worst I don't actually think
I've had a worse customer support thing
from anyone they say people who update
to Windows 10 can roll back their prior
system for 31 days which doesn't help
people who are not tech savvy and whose
upgrades don't complete successful yeah
or if it fails like mine did yep yeah so
basically the lawyer that filed the
Florida lawsuit said that Microsoft's
marketing scheme he calls it falls short
of certain protections which must be
afforded and then claims that the
damages owed to consumers who have
struggled with the new software may
total tens of millions of dollars wreck
and I'm kind of leaning towards I hate
to do this but I might have to agree
with a lawyer because I'm sorry John
yeah because I am leaning towards him
being more correct about it so I think
he's right then I think it's gonna cost
them tens of millions of dollars yeah
one percent what no no it's all good
John don't worry everything's fine all
right speaking of everything being good
you and I had some more experience than
usual yeah with Dollar Shave Club razors
each so I don't think I've clean-shaven
since 2012 I think in the first wine
show I was in I think I'm clean-shaven
Ned yeah it sounds about right
I think yeah so it's like weird and I
didn't realize how like spiky it is if
you're trying to let it grow back yeah
so like this morning I woke up and was
like my hand stuck like a paper yeah
holy crap anyways I did use Dollar Shave
Club razors to do it yep and I used
Dollar Shave Club razor to shave my
chest for the first time I didn't show a
nipples so is that average I'm not I've
never heard I'm ever
yeah I've never shaved my chest I've
never really felt the need I just have
kind of like this weird tuft in the
middle like I don't have a lot yeah is
it enough that like if you wear DP it's
just like no cuz they grow down
yeah like it's just kind of like this
weird like things I got you're going on
and then it's kind of weird like all
over the rest of like my shoulders desk
I have like these individual random like
it's bizarre but I shaved my chest for
the first time I used I believe it was
the four blade I I actually borrowed
Luke's Fiorenza we were at the spray-tan
place and I was like shaving my chest in
the bathroom it was the executive very
strange experience was it no no it's not
the executive that's a six blade one oh
yeah you have the one you have the
stepdance
anyway so dollarshaveclub.com I don't we
actually talk about their their offer it
has a special offer for new members who
joined today you get a free month of the
executive razor that's their top tier
when you buy a tube of dr. Carver shave
butter which by the way I also used for
my chest shaving experience because you
do not want to shave blind over a nipple
no nope that's not a thing you would
want to do so being able to see what
you're doing shape shave butter goes on
clear is definitely a plus it's trippy
because back when I did used to clean
shave I had foam stuff so I'm used to
like oh you can see it when it's ready
but no you just you can still see your
face perfectly yeah it's actually kind
of handy yeah um so yeah basically
that's the offer right now all you got
to do is go to dollarshaveclub.com slash
Linus if you live in Canada the United
States or Australia and you can be a
member of the club enjoying all the
great benefits like razors and other
bathroom supplies including the shea
butter their aftershave and their one
wipe Charlies delivered directly to your
door once a month so you can use a fresh
razor blade all the time and always feel
good and always get a nice clean shave
and you can save money compared to going
to be you know pharmacy or chemist or
whatever it is they call it in the
various countries around the world the
chemists apakah theory but yep yeah
apothecary is that how the is that yeah
I think that is right yeah apathy curry
patta
apothecary anyway the point is you save
money it gets delivered right to your
door you don't have to leave the house
to look like you leave the house and
yeah don't
we've ever gotten a complaint from our
viewers about Dollar Shave Club which is
about the strongest indoor event that I
can do for anyone I always get comments
of people being like cool you have a
beard
how can you advertise don't you take
club one I shave it down here all the
time too otherwise you'd have a neck
beard yeah it goes down to like here
it's really bad so I shave it hey all
right so more more windows10 crap the
original article here is from PC gamer
dot-com Tim Sweeney thinks Microsoft
will make steam progressively worse with
Windows 10 patches this is sorry share
my screen and then do you think Oh share
your screen and then oh I could do that
did you post it into a shutter I did so
for those of you who don't know who Tim
Sweeney is the co-founder of epic games
and created the Unreal Engine and stuff
you know and stuff so like sort of a big
freaky reveal like he's right up there
with your Carmack's and your Newell's
definitely an important guy believes
that Microsoft will work to make steam
progressively worse in order to force
developers onto the universal Windows
platform with the endgame goal of
essentially closing the open PC gaming
ecosystem a funny thing about this kind
of I'd love to call it tinfoil hat nests
but he's a really smart guy and a savvy
guy and they are not the same thing he's
a smart guy he's a well-connected guy
he's a savvy guy and he's saying that he
thinks that's the direction it's going
so you know how we were giving Microsoft
high-fives for bringing PC Xbox games to
the PC pub for Kara seeming like they
cared about PC gamers we might have
gotten ahead of ourselves because we
wanted to not care they might be trying
to turn PC gamers into Xbox gamers we
might have the exact right amount of
caring a few months ago yeah so one of
the one of the things that is directly
directly worries me and this is one of
the last lines in the actual are
if my laptop stops freezing I will get
there it says it wrists when turning
Windows into a closed platform risks
neutering new breakthrough such as VR
and that is before they had a chance to
flourish and that is actually a pretty
good point
steam for all the shortfalls of things
like green light steam is not perfect no
no there's tons of problems in the VR
section on steam there's so many entire
pages worth of just terrible useless
pieces of trash and it's kind of a
problem for VR right now but at the same
time someone who creates something can
get on Steam surprisingly without that
much difficulty and that can also be
relatively important for VR right now
because the second someone tries
something that's purely innovative and
is amazing and works really well for the
platform it can push out quickly and
they don't have to jump through hoops
and it's not a closed ecosystem this is
great big tea 1971 asks if the wind show
is sponsored by fake tan this week kind
of no but the tan is definitely fake or
the fake tan is real look at this side
of my arm yeah compared to Linus his
face here you go this part didn't get
that much spray tan like can you imagine
trying to play VR games without valve
and oculus just basically
stepping up and creating their own
entire ecosystem yeah for them and like
I'm gonna take a very quick aside I
promise won't talk about it for too long
for all the flak people gave me in the
oculus rift review from the vive
community even though it was a negative
oculus rift review which still confuses
me about oculus supporting developers
and how I should have talked about it
more even though I did say that they
were only supporting timed exclusives
without a time they just wanted them to
release on rift first anyways oculus has
deeply funded like 70 games or something
at this point and that's actually pretty
cool
so I mean we're giving Microsoft kudos
for basically removing horrible things
that they had before but they've
actually done very little to help VR
compared to what companies like valve
and oculus are expected to do completely
on their own and they're not completely
on their own and valve has their own
just to be clear so valve has their own
VR funding stuff that they are doing so
like both of those companies are doing
awesome things in terms of helping VR
stuff so anyway it's to summarize sort
of that this was actually in an
interview with edge magazine so to
summarize Sweeney's comments he
basically goes okay look every PC game
for the last few decades has used win32
and it's been responsible for the
vibrant software market we have now but
also for malware any program can be a
virus and Universal Windows platform is
seen as an ante and as an antidote to
that it's sandbox it's much more locked
down but the risk is that if Microsoft
convinces everybody to use it then they
phase out win32 apps and if they can
succeed in doing that then it's a small
leap to forcing all apps and games to be
distributed through the Windows Store
which as we've seen already has it just
doesn't work with higher framerate
doesn't work with anything like just
crappy it's like oh yeah every game runs
fullscreen windowed mode now why how
about not how about not that I mean how
are we supposed to do things like oh I
don't know benchmark a game using an
application like fraps that jumps in in
between the program and the driver and
the output and overlays things like this
sounds like the kind of stuff that is
not going to work very well if you lock
it down and you go look okay every game
runs at 60fps 1080p and 4k like it
wouldn't even surprise me and I've seen
games that don't support certain
resolutions just because we just didn't
think of it like I like it wouldn't
surprise me if you had a 4096 by 2160
monitor which is 4k by the way 38 60 by
21 or 30 60 by 38 40
2160 is uhd they're not the same thing
if you had a 4k monitor like it wouldn't
surprise me if it didn't work properly
because that standard kind of took a
couple flaps of it's gigantic wings and
then face-planted into the sand cuz no
one cared and I've seen stuff like that
before
where weirdo resolutions like 1440 by
900 just aren't supported for some
reason I don't know I hate it I hate the
idea he's been around forever I think if
they try to do this though they're gonna
run into crazy anti-competitive problems
let's help in terms of legality
especially because steam has already
been established for so long yeah I
don't think they're gonna fight it
that's what his thing is like if over
the years they force patch windows10 to
make steam buggier then people will
welcome the Windows Store with open arms
because they'll blame valve I mean
blaming valve is a very popular thing to
do they'll blame valve for steam being
crap when ultimately it had nothing to
do with evolve but worship Newell yeah
yeah that's kind of how is it all right
again more summer than I thought but it
scratched my arm and it's like really
burning now mm-hmm okay
Verizon the original article hears from
CBC News Verizon confirms four point
eight three billion dollar takeover of
Yahoo's core business this does not
include Yahoo's shares in Alibaba which
are worth a lot by the way or Yahoo
Japan which counter-intuitively is a
separate company and actually has very
little to do with normal Yahoo so it
includes their advertising content
search and mobile activities
apparently Yahoo owned thirty four
percent of Yahoo Japan as lawyers yeah
go figure right
like did Yahoo have content and search
like this anyone search on Yahoo I guess
Verizon must think so
I think they also owned a lot of other
things even though it wasn't Alibaba
well they just bought eol yeah which
they acquired just over
a year ago this is great oh sorry sorry
Verizon owns AOL so Verizon seems to be
collecting like this these defunct web
companies like web 1.0 companies yeah so
just a year ago we acquired AOL to
enhance our strategy of providing a
cross screen connection for consumers
creators and advertisers whatever that
means and this is great this is the rest
of the statement from Verizon the
acquisition of Yahoo will put Verizon in
a highly competitive position as a top
global mobile media company and help
accelerate our revenue stream in digital
advertising so Yahoo will be integrated
with AOL I guess maybe I'm missing
something here but but every time we
talk about Yahoo we we we don't
understand it yeah maybe we just kind of
have because okay legs even the farm net
people I don't know anyone that's on
Yahoo specifically early sorry al
yeah no I mean that's an ISP I think AOL
is pretty much gone I mean maybe twitch
chat I mean I don't think anyone
watching videos on twitch it's gonna be
on any well but maybe people watching
the archive at 240p or 144p are gonna
let us know that they're on yeah yeah
Yahoo Answers okay okay sure I encounter
Yahoo Answers in time to time although
not as much as I used to yeah not as
much as I used to these days Korra calm
comes up a lot it's like a pay site how
are they getting submissions like do
they pay the people who answer the
questions I don't maybe get it maybe
that could be a good if so that's kind
of brilliant cuz the answers on there
are really good but if you want to click
anything else from an answer page it
prompts you to buy a membership but if
you look at the name of that question
page that you want to read and you go
back and google it then you can go read
that one for hahaha so it's actually
just the right amount of being
accessible to everyone but putting a
barricade in your way if you don't pay I
don't know I think I think it's a really
interesting yahoo mail is apparently
very popular
according to rim my mom who whose
parents probably use yahoo mail so they
bought Engadget yeah that's part of it
okay sure yeah who sports okay okay so
there's some content there okay all
right moving on this is pretty scary
interests and I guess they like bought
all the people that are technically out
of touch right cuz I don't even know who
gets their sports news from Yahoo Sports
or like people that use Yahoo Mail but
it still exists and people do use it
yeah and we know one like I'm pretty
sure you Vaughn's parents use Yahoo Mail
okay but like so they bought it one over
50 technically out of touch yeah yeah
okay all right this is some scary
business right here if you get caught
using a VPN in the UAE you could face
fines up to five hundred and forty five
thousand US dollars Wow
so they introduced a federal law banning
the use of VPNs to try to avoid paying
for expensive voice over IP services
which is a very interesting reason to
care about people using VPNs it's a
royal edict from the president making it
illegal for anyone in the country to use
a VPN or secure proxy server that's such
a weird reason you could face jail time
by the way and fines of between five
hundred thousand to two million you AE
dirham it was announced this week by the
UAE president and because this is just
like an edict like I think this
basically got sprung on people I had not
heard any rumblings of this I had no
idea maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong the
wording is apparently ambiguous and
technologically illiterate but it
basically seems like you're not allowed
to use systems that hide the fact that
you're committing a crime or covering
one up and if you are routing network
traffic you could be evading the eyes of
the state while breaking the law
Wow so there's a tweaked law taken from
the site Emirates 24/7 that says whoever
uses a fraudulent computer network
Protocol address or IP address by using
a false address or a third-party address
by any other names for the purpose of
committing a crime or preventing its
discovery shall be punished by temporary
imprisonment and a fine of no less than
500,000 during and either of these two
penalties Wow that's awesome so let's
understand even through reading the
article I don't understand like like
this section right here void
over-the-top apps have been a thorn in
the side of telecom operators around the
world because customers no longer need
to pay international calling rates to
speak to their beloved ones they can
just speak to them on Skype whatsapp
Facebook message or viber or snapchat or
whatever the hell else and so on and so
on
yeah but UAE is one of the first
governments in the world to actually
regulate on behalf of so can you not use
those because you don't need a VPN to
use Skype whatsapp Facebook message or
fiber or snapchat no but the problem is
that in the UAE they have pretty crappy
filtering systems in place okay yeah so
that like they're filtering the internet
there people are using VPNs to get
around or already restricted internet
access so this is really interesting in
fact from our notes here less than 15%
of the kingdom's inhabitants are locals
with the rest of the population made up
of expatriates so many of those people
probably want access to private
corporate networks and the internet
without being limited by that filtering
system and it looks like I mean I'd like
to say that I can't imagine them
actually enforcing this because it seems
insane but if they were insane enough to
implement this law in the first place
maybe they're insane enough to enforce
it I personally wouldn't install a VPN
because I wouldn't be the one to take
that bullet just to find out right
that's kind of ridiculous unless some
VPN steps up and goes like we're
untrackable will pay your fine yeah but
Vicky they can imprison you well yeah
you call I don't wanna go to prison you
freakin
yes all right 7-eleven this article's
from the verge calm just made the first
commercial delivery by drone I mean can
you the the marketing for this just
writes itself look up to the heavens for
7-eleven you know would be kind of great
if you're like out playing soccer or
something you just have like a Slurpee
delivery to you I know right so it took
place on July 11th actually and they
partnered with drones startup flirty to
make the delivery to a private residence
in Reno Nevada they delivered a chicken
sandwich Donuts coffee candy and
Slurpees is the goods were packaged into
two containers each separately flown to
the home and the drone flew autonomously
from the store to the household using
GPS to navigate Wow
so they've selected a store from which
to deliver and surveyed customers within
a one-mile radius to see if they'd be
willing to take part this is not the
first delivery that flirty has made but
it appears to be the first that a
customer had placed as an order with the
store and then okay had it delivered
like the first sort of proper transit
yeah 7-eleven said it plans to continue
working with the drone company but
didn't lay out a timeline for rolling
out the service to a wider region right
pretty cool eh yeah I mean we in our in
in my like still functional somewhat you
know a we're adult lifetime I could live
to see a world where a self-driving car
picks me up in the morning I'm like
hungry or whatever and I go okay yeah I
want like a Subway sandwich here's my
specs deliver it to my work I arrive at
work in my self-driving car having been
on my phone the whole time because by
then I guess that law won't be in place
anymore unless you're driving it in
which case has never been in place but I
could step out of my car have a drone
and basically drop a frickin sandwich in
my hand I could walk in set up my desk
eat my sandwich my car could be running
a
carting other people around making me
money very obviously in your lifetime
you might not have to go to work
tell telecommuting is like a huge
research section yeah I don't know about
it for this cuz I was kind of still
planning to do this okay you're wanting
to be hosting when your careers ending
when my careers I know I was thinking
this could happen in like the next five
to ten years yeah but you were just
talking like survivable lifespan oh no I
mean before I reach the point where I'm
like all decotis what's going on yeah
like while I'm still about as functional
as I am today give or take okay yeah
yeah that's pretty crazy
loving it I'm sorry sponsors we already
did it Dollar Shave oh yeah yeah we did
it early yeah no we didn't know
drastically up late yeah okay
there's ami-nee notebook air is now
official and according to the windows
central.com headline anyway you will
want to buy one so they're going after
the 13.3 inch MacBook Air and they it's
apparently 13 percent thinner I've
actually looked at this 13-point percent
thinner and 11 percent smaller while
managing to offer a similar sized screen
their laptop is called the notebook air
they couldn't like be even slightly
creative are they gonna get sued for
that they should call it the notebook
oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide mix yes
Jerry yeah I kind of feel like they
should get sued for that so features a
brushed aluminum body laminated 13.3
inch full HD display edge to edge glass
6th generation Core i5 and an Nvidia 940
MX card so it actually has a dedicated
GPU which by the way you won't be using
to game on but you could be using it to
accelerate things like Adobe Premiere
with a you know cinah form Kodak video
content I'm something that we have shown
off in an Asus Zenbook in the past
though that Zenbook is not thinner than
a MacBook Air so that's pretty cool it's
got 2 USB 3 ports an HDMI one
three-and-a-half millimeter jack and a
u.s. piece
a port and there's no xiaomi branding at
the front but you can customize the
front of the notebook with these
stickers yeah very cool so here's kind
of a cool look at like starry night as
like a skin on it
there's a lot of in this article there's
a lot of like you might need to be sued
for that China's like wild wild Orient
yeah but are they going to sell this in
other places yeah so yeah they can get
sued for that no no yeah that's not my
problem no but like so no mentions as of
now regarding availability outside of
China there you go
okay so Vizio
acquired by Chinese tech company Lee Co
let you go for two billion this is one
of the sketchiest and sponsor deals that
we have ever turned down by the way you
don't know about this but I actually I
am at the point now where I don't even
want to know who they were or why they
cared but someone approached us about
doing a sponsored tweet speculating that
Vizio might be acquired like by a large
tech company and then putting like
Google question mark Apple question mark
and we were like well which one is it
and they're like we can't tell you and
we're like that's stupid we're not doing
that yeah we don't know what your agenda
is but we don't like it don't talk to us
anymore
and basically it would end like to be
clear guys actually this is something we
almost never talked about we almost
never talk about sponsor deals that we
turned down but it happens a lot because
there's a lot of sketchy crap out there
and it's really it's really interesting
for us because we have that insider's
perspective seeing who took the deals
after because
you know like we'll see a tweet that
doesn't have a sponsored hashtag on it
or like it's the exact copy from whoever
yeah yeah so it's really interesting for
us seeing who's on the take and being
upfront about it and who's not
unfortunately I'm not getting involved
in that kind of stuff publicly I'm sorry
I'm sure the twitch chat is already full
of people saying wool why don't you guys
say no not going to happen just not
interested in in being like the next
sort of whatever drama channel but yeah
I'm really glad we didn't we didn't take
we didn't take this one because I just I
had a bad feeling about it and I'm glad
that I trusted myself yeah and who the
hell even is the Eco there they're
pretty they're huge they're like a big
deal right there or the Google or Apple
no they're not Google they're not out
including their Chinese and there's a
pretty misleading tweet then yep so
Vizio founder and CEO William Wang will
continue to all own 51% and Louie Co
will own 49% of inscape blah blah blah
blah blah blah physically operate as an
independent subsidiary this Vizio still
really like a thing and that's physios
data business by the way oh yeah this he
was a thing as far as I know last time I
checked they were the number one TV
maker in the US okay yeah they're not
they're not really as much of a thing in
Canada okay I don't know that they're
still number one but they were at one
point maybe that's my problem
that's I don't shop for TVs yeah the
last TV I got I traded a friend an H 100
and some Dominator RAM for it and the TV
before that doesn't exist so that's my
shopping for TVs experience alright yeah
I don't really have much else to say
about that are we are we is that it is
that the show is that everything the
interesting that happens no Apple sold
its billionth iPhone so like good for
them I guess
good job
32 released full VR spectators
terrifying actually like one iPhone for
every seven people on earth
well not mmm the weird way to look at it
because huh a lot of people would have
just been replacing I know I know I
don't mean one out of every seven people
on their phones an iPhone I just mean
yeah like if you walk if you were like
walk down the street one out of every
seven of like like as you just like walk
and look at people like every time you
walk by seven people like an iPhone
rolls off of a factory line like that's
kind of the visual that I had in my head
that make sense oh this is interesting
so the original article here is from
overclocked 3d net invidious Pascal
Titan X will not feature faster FP 64 or
FP 16 performance so this was one of the
marks of the original Titan was that it
could handle double precision I think
not quite as well as a Quadro but better
than a g-force if I recall correctly and
so it was popular for CUDA programmers
it was it was for more than just gaming
but the new Titan X will be much like
its Maxwell predecessor and it will not
have that feature it is just an ultra
powerful gaming GPU and nothing more
pretty much all I have to say at this
point it's been kind of a tiring week I
have finished like nothing this week but
I have a lot of stuff on the go I've got
my USB type-c versus micro be
head-to-head real world
how many plugs comparison I've got a
really cool idea for reducing the size
and weight of the tether on the HTC vive
so I've got that rolling right now I've
got the predator g1 desktop from Acer
I've got the gigabyte Aero 14 laptop
I've got I'm sure there's other stuff
that I've got on the go right now but
like this week has just been frustrating
because I've worked on so much but
finished
nothing I've got what CPU should I buy
I'm finally I've I can't believe I never
did it before but I'm finally doing what
CPU should I buy so I've compiled this
ginormous like comparative database that
I can use to kind of go this one mm-hmm
if you're this person this one and like
have that be like a really good final
answer I I got mostly scripted on three
videos and then reached out for a
comment from a particular company and
they pushed it back and then I pushed
for that meeting and then they pushed it
back again so I just like wasn't able to
do those three videos which were like
two reviews and then one like what the
hell is going on with this thing video
so I lost like all my videos for this
week so that's cool although that means
there will be easy videos later
yeah but work isn't wasted yeah which is
nice I guess there's another really
there's another really frustrating one
for me the pin my wife is owed to
basically that call that I had just
before we started the show that was
actually one of the reasons the show was
a little late today that call that I had
confirmed that the problem is Telus
really once again in my life Telus has
managed to screw me yep so the the
wirings sorry what is it basically the
problems that he was having with the
system were not related to my system
that I put in with help from ubiquity
that's running great but his internet
keeps bugging out because and they've
even replaced his modem at this point
but because the like wiring is bad and
there's a technician coming tomorrow
which is a Saturday which means that
whatever is wrong with it must be super
wrong with it because Telus normally
does not come out on a Saturday yeah
that I'm aware of
yeah all right oh also someone in the
chat speculated that what I was talking
about was a Titan XP it is not I also
got completely dodged on that
and at this point I think they're just
not giving us one oh really yeah
last three times I think no response oh
okay so it's like available in like
three days or something isn't it
August 2nd yeah okay so I don't know
well thanks for tuning in guys we'll see
you again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel I gotta say it was pretty
refreshing not having any technical
issues on the show huge shout out to
epifanio guys can get used to hearing
this over the next little bit cuz they
didn't do like a formal sponsorship but
they did provide us with the capture
equipment and I did say that I would
definitely be giving them a shout out
we're actually planning still to rebuild
the when streaming PC so that's still
gonna be a thing that happens and I'm
gonna give you guys more details once
we've been through a number of seamless
shows on the new capture cards that are
just working properly I'll give you guys
all the full details about what we're
using for the setup here so yeah there
you go guys apparently the audio is
messed up now well we're asking for
after-party I will be doing mine like I
normally do and I will be going home
because I'm tired it's really hot yeah
it's like super sunburns make you really
tired
alright wonder what the like science is
biology
yeah yeah the ytyt
