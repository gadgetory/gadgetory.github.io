evolved some of the components have
become much more sophisticated like the
controllers on board that have gone from
rudimentary single-core Affairs to
multi-core processors with huge amounts
of RAM and complex algorithms built into
their firmware but the foundation of
nearly every SSD the NAND flash memory
that actually stores your data has
actually gotten progressively worse in
some big ways we went from high speed
and super reliable SLC flash which
stores only a single one or zero to each
cell to dual er mlc to Triple A or TLC
two finally today this is the Intel 660
P the first consumer SSD with qlc flash
which is notable for its ability to
store four bits per cell that means 16
separate voltage levels this gives it
fantastic affordability especially for
an nvme SSD but my mama always told me
if it seems too good to be true it
probably is so let's take a look at the
pros and cons
for today only you can pick up PC
building simulator on chrono GG for $15
us so check it and all of chrono GG's
games out at the link in the video
description let's start with the bad
stuff first up is that QL cement has
lower endurance than PLC which means
that all other things being equal it
doesn't last for as long why well I'm
glad you asked because it's science time
with pictures this is really important
every time a cell gets written to a
voltage pulse is sent through the
control gate which creates an electric
field which agitates the electrons
causing them to move through the silicon
dioxide layer towards the floating gate
that their layer wears out a tiny bit
every time a program erase command is
sent to the cell causing some of these
shifting electrons to get stuck inside
of it which means that it will have and
more importantly continue accumulating a
progressively more negative charge now
this gets compensated for by applying
ever slightly higher positive voltage to
the cell to get it to the desired
voltage state now at some point the
voltage levels start bordering those
required by the adjacent states to the
point where it takes too long to
distinguish what's what and that block
will get taken out behind the barn old
yeller style now the fewer layers that
there are inside of a cell the wider the
spare voltages in between the states so
then as you can imagine with qlc the
point of cannot deal with this anymore
GD cell come sooner than with TLC and
especially mlc or SLC much sooner second
bad stuffs qlc is also slower which like
wait a second
why why is that denser processor
transistors are better increasing the
areal density of a hard drive platter is
better shouldn't more data density and
NAND flash be better
unfortunately no it's actually the
opposite you see with hard drives
cramming more data into the same surface
area increases the read and the write
speeds because the platter rotates at a
constant speed usually 5400 to 7200 rpm
or so which means that the more densely
the bits are packed the more of them
pass under the head in a given amount of
time more bits is more data so denser in
this case is better that is as long as
you can keep your read error rate under
control but that's a little separate
discussion back to SSDs for now when an
SSD cell is accessed a distinction
between the multiple voltage levels
needs to be made and the number of
states that you need to sift through
goes up exponentially with the number of
layers that it holds so the more layers
the more states and the longer it takes
to get a reading for example it takes 25
microseconds to read for SLC 54 MLC 75
for TLC and a hundred for qlc and it's
the same story with writes except the
performance drop off is even worse
finally big problem number three here
we're getting into this drive
specifically the advertised write speeds
are kind of hax because there isn't
really a right way to do it you see this
drive treats part of its qlc cells as
SLC flash as a kind of cache so remember
SLC that's the fastest kind and the
exact size of this cache scales
depending on how much you've filled up
your drive so so then by this point in
the video you're probably thinking all
right well then qlc has a severe case of
the no bueno x' and this here 660 P
Drive is a no me gusta but know
everything that we just said was in
theory now it's time for a little bit of
reality so to put those hacks right
numbers to the test and see just how bad
the whole SLC cache with slower qlc
behind it deal affects things we hit
this drive with a full range right
through HD tune Pro and guess what
halfway through the performance
plummeted to below that of a hard drive
and then stayed there for consecutive
runs after a brief spike on each run but
then we observed this behavior only
after more than half of the drives
capacity was written to something that
was supposed to happen earlier on in the
test which got us thinking maybe the
caching algorithm was actually working
in the background
shuffling data over to the slower key OC
cells so we tried running the cache
flusher utility from Intel's SSD toolbox
during the test and observed its
progress bar actually going backwards
while our benchmark was showing
throughput spikes when we ran the cache
flush after doing a full capacity right
it took about 20 minutes total and then
restored the drive to its full write
speed now when we tested Intel's own
higher tier and noticeably more
expensive 760 P we also saw write
performance drop during the first run
after it ran at a cache and dropped
further on consecutive runs but as you'd
expect it remained much faster in the
same scenarios than its lesser sibling
okay so that's synthetic tests but what
about a real life but edge case let's
copy a 250 gig steam folder over to the
660 P there we go same thing
it starts off fast then it dips dip dips
and plummets like OCC stock before their
bankruptcy in 2013 when compared to a
similarly priced 840 Evo that they
managed to maintain a steady 485
megabytes per second and completed the
copy in only 8 minutes and 45 seconds
this thing took a staggering 23 and a
half minutes remember when I said qlc is
slow without a cache
well behold the worst case scenario
slower than a hard drive meanwhile the
TLC equipped 7 6 DP after starting off
strong dropped to a more stable 560
megabytes per second and then maintained
that completing the same transfer in 8
minutes
20 seconds now let's get more realistic
all of the theory crafting we've done so
far failed to have any tangible effect
on our other tests game load times were
about the same between all three drives
and when we ran the PC market storage
subsystem bench we had to double check
that we didn't accidentally test the
same drive twice
so a typical LTT video takes up about 24
gigs for a seven and a half minutes
which takes about 20 minutes to render
so just over one gigabyte per second of
right so we wouldn't have any
performance drop unless we were filling
up our 660 P to the brim leaving no room
for SLC caching which by the way we
don't recommend filling up any SSD also
keep in mind that during normal usage
your SSD is idle the vast majority of
the time so that cache flush algorithm
will have all the time it needs to
quietly restore your SSD in the
background so now that we've covered the
worst case for qlc performance and how
the SLC cache can give it boosts of
higher performance
let's talk longevity when compared to
intel's own TLC 760 p drive this thing
is rated for 1/3 the longevity but
looking closer
this actually assumes about a hundred
gigabytes of writes per day that is
basically equivalent to rendering out a
couple of LTT videos and installing doom
on your computer every day it's not a
realistic use case for the average
consumer so to sum things up if you were
to install a 660 p SSD in your system
unless you're using it for something
that it wasn't designed for like as a
cache for your nas or your hard drive
all things considered you would save a
few bucks since this is Intel we're
talking about they're not generally
known for their aggressive pricing this
thing out competes other nvme drives on
price and you'd probably never notice
that you're running qlc because of the
SLC cache and you'd have a five-year
warranty to give you peace of mind
unless of course the drive hits its
total drive rights limit before that
five years run zone
so the enthusiast in me has some serious
misgivings about this move for the nand
storage industry
but this product wasn't made for me
that's opting and I haven't seen
anything about this drive to suggest
that it won't do a good job for its
intended audience thanks to the firmware
and controller trickery that we alluded
to earlier I guess that's okay even if
it makes me uncomfortable do you need to
