the Asus Ares 2 you can see I have an
entire master carton of Ares 2's which
is 5 cards
hence the size of this enormous box on
the table in front of me actually I lied
we do not have a master carton of Ares
two's every Ares 2 comes in a box this
big so we're going to strip off the
outer carton and we will be back in just
a moment now I was expecting some random
foam around a box but no the Ares 2 is
actually the entire size of the inside
of this outer packing carton in fact it
I guess it's possible that a Seuss
doesn't even intend for retailers to put
this this shipping box on the Shelf it's
probably more intended to be displayed
like this and that's just to protect the
box from scuffs in transit so let's go
ahead and have a look at what a soos has
to say for themselves really briefly the
asus 2 features a custom cooler with
liquid dissipation and air cooling so
we'll show you this once we open it up
13 percent faster than gtx 690 130
percent faster than HD 7970 and we'll
explain why that would be and one card
six displays with six gigabytes of gddr5
and a three-year limited warranty on
this guy alright let's go ahead and yeah
supports AMD crossfire so yes you could
actually install two of them for a quad
GPU set up if you wanted so that would
be 12 gigs of GPU memory in your system
alright general specs so they are both
7970 gigahertz Edition GPUs it is a dual
GPU card
they are clocked at 10 50 megahertz base
so that's over 1 gigahertz base and they
boost at one point one gigahertz memory
clock is six thousand six hundred
megahertz memory interface is 768 bit ok
ok Asus you don't actually get to do
that the memory interface is going to be
half of that so they're doubling it
because there's two GPUs but maximum
digital resolution 2560 okay none of
this is relevant anymore let's go ahead
and open this bad boy up a suit doesn't
act
they seal the box so I guess that
there's probably a reason for that so
let's go ahead and okay yet another box
inside so give us a moment this is like
one of those Russian dolls with the box
inside the box inside see look you can
stack them all like this and then we're
going to find something even crazier and
even more impressive inside this guy so
this looks like a very high-end sort of
you know casing for what might be like a
really cool you know gun inside I mean
it's kind of a weapon
you know weapon for gaming or whatever
else you want to do it's here's your
hinges on the back it's got feet on the
bottom so you could transport the card
around outside of your system if you
really wanted to it does lock so at the
very least this case will be reusable
for you once you are finished installing
the ares 2 in your system feels like a
collector's item and is packaged like a
collector's item I cannot I cannot
overstate how expensive every last
detail of this card is down to things
like this packing foam getting a custom
foam like this this is hand assembled I
hope you guys realize that I know I harp
on packaging a lot but look at this
these pieces are actually glued together
by hand and cut to the exact shape to
match the Ares 2 graphics card that is
how this happens it's not magic there's
no machine that produces these that is
the only way to produce custom foam like
this ok so inside you find an additional
fan for the radiator so we're going to
talk more about the hybrid cooling
solution soon you find mounting screws
for the radiator okay so those bolt
through the fan through your case and
into the rat we find ah
the numbered card telling you exactly
which areas you get this document sort
of certifies that the limited edition is
a unique order art designed by the
aluminum plate is individually laser
carved and sequentially numbered to
certify the limited edition status
making it a collector's item and then
the card itself you know what yeah here
we go
so this probably looks pretty familiar
guys here I'm just going to flip this
bad boy up a little bit the back is
protected okay there we go so put it
down there so this probably looks
familiar this looks an awful lot like an
ace attack LC LC with a thick 120
millimeter radiator so as long as your
case has support for a single 120 mil
rad you can install the Ares 2 assuming
you don't already have a radiator
mounted to that point it comes with a
push-pull fan design so it is looks like
it is set up by default to be installed
in your case this way so as an exhaust
so you would hook up that additional fan
here and plug both fans into the card
directly where it can actually be
controlled using Asus GPU tweak software
see right there there's a harness that
has one of the fans plugged in already
and the other fan is ready to be plugged
in and that gives you control over
overclocking fan profiles as well as any
other Diagnostics you'd need to have
about the cards such as the temperatures
which I can tell you right now will be
surprisingly low for a dual GPU card
okay inside we also find sort of you
know whatever who cares drivers and all
that that you should download the latest
of all so all the accessories that you'd
expect including a crossfire bridge DVI
to HDMI adapter an asus rog case badge
very very cool
silica gel do not eat 300 dual 6 pin PCI
e2 8 pin PCIe adapters and we'll show
you why you need that in just a moment
here and finally the card itself the
Ares 2
so these liquid cooling tubes these
quarter inch tubes actually cool the
GPUs so there are two here we go two
GPUs on the card one of them is here the
other one is here those are both 79 full
7970 gigahertz editions unlike regular
dual GPU cards they are not down clocked
or under volted in any way they're just
Bend for extreme performance and lower
power consumption and they are
used on this PCB it has a unique 20
phase power design which brings me to
why there is still an 80 millimeter
cooling fan on the card itself because
the water so you can actually see into
the cooler very well but the water cools
the GPUs and this is responsible just
for cooling the vrm assembly as well as
the memory itself so it is you can
actually kind of see it there so it's
vented throughout the card so that it is
going to be pushing air down the
channels where it's actually needed see
so pushing air out here down to the PCB
of your motherboard out over here where
it can go through wherever it needs to
go at least I think yeah yeah so out
this way over here
cooling everything that it needs to on
the actual PCB so it requires 3/8 pin
power connectors which is actually not
unprecedented we've seen cards that do
this before so if you wanted to install
to Ares 2 cards you would need to make
sure that you have to 120 millimeter
mounting points in range of your GPU
slots of your PCI Express slots you need
to make sure you have six PCI Express 8
pin connectors this is a pcie 3.0 16 X
card as you'd probably expect in order
to get the bandwidth it needs out of the
slot up here you find one crossfire
finger so that gives you the ability to
install up to two of these in a system
because you can have up to four GPU
crossfire so there's two GPUs here and
then there'd be two on the other one so
hence the one crossfire bridge the yes
here we go I don't want like I don't
want to put fingerprints on it or
anything so I'm going to be careful to
you know we'll be back in a moment
so other things about this card that
make it cost an absolute fortune to make
the tooling and the design the machine
work that goes into a building a like
massive cooler like this I mean this
this plate of aluminum at the time of
starting to cut into it with the machine
had to be about this thick in order to
get the design that Asus was going for
you see the angles that everything is
cut at like you see how that that mark
goes in at an angle and then on the
other side there's straight cuts and
then
cuts that go in at an angle as well that
is just absolutely precision
manufactured and when you're only
building a thousand of these cards it's
not like you're going to make the it's
not like you're going to make the money
back in the volume that you're selling
or anything like that so the custom PCB
the design that actually goes into
building something like this I mean ACR
AMD tried to build a 79 70 X 2 you know
dual dual GPU card and wasn't able to
pull it off
so like it's and that would have been to
sell a lot more than a thousand units so
a sous put all that work into it just to
sell a thousand plus again the custom
PCB the custom cooler the custom sort of
everything that goes into it I didn't
want to take the cover off the backplate
because it is brushed aluminum so what
I'd really recommend that folks who buy
these do is install it in your system
then take the protective cover off
because as soon as you touch that
aluminum it's going to leave
fingerprints on it and it could
potentially stain it and slick saying
something yeah or use gloves to install
it making sure of course that they're
like not staticky gloves or anything
like that so yeah remove before use oh
the sheer the sheer size of this card
let's go retrieve something else ah yes
here's a 79 70 so it's hard to tell
without another card for so this is
already a big graphics card there it is
for comparison with an Ares 2 so the
Ares 2 is a full inch taller a full inch
longer than a single 7970 but the most
impressive thing about it perhaps is the
fact that it is still only a dual slot
card so you don't need three slots this
is the first Mars or Ares card that
hasn't required three empty slots for
case compatibility alright we're going
to wrap up with one more thing and that
is the i/o at the back so we sue says
native six outputs and they mean it
because you don't need any air exhaust
in order to cool the card because it's
mostly liquid cooled Asus can have a
full IO shield with four DisplayPort
outs and two dual link DVI outputs thank
