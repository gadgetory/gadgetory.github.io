was a place in the market for pre-built
compact gaming PCs like the digital
storm bolt 3 and I guess given the rise
of machines like the Corsair one and
MSI's Trident well it's safe to say that
yes yes there is
so when digital storm called us up and
offered to ship us their new bolt X for
an exclusive early look how could we say
no cooler masters 25th anniversary
edition cosmos 2 features a unique dual
curved tempered glass side panel check
it out now at the link below from the
outside the bolt X is pretty similar to
the bolt 3 we reviewed back in 2015 it
retains the clear edge to edge acrylic
side panel the strange placement of
ventilation holes on the other side
panel and the separate upper panel where
the 240 millimeter cooling radiator
hides like the bolt 3 the bolt X is
available in both the brushed aluminum
fingerprint magnet finish of our older
unit and the shiny exotic paint finish
of our bolt X digital storm also listed
up the base of the case providing a
little bit more clearance for air intake
on the bottom one odd thing that you
might have noticed by now is that there
is no front i/o not even a power switch
to accompany the RGB Front logo no
digital storm instead opted to put it on
the side aesthetically this clean look
works really well for us but the option
for a front optical drive is also gone
and whether cables sticking out the
front or out the side is best really
depends on your desk layout but enough
boring stuff let's get inside it's
impossible to miss the immaculately run
custom sleeves power K
and all hardline water cooling setup
with red dyed liquid to match the
exterior our unit has both the GPU and
video card water cooled which ended up
giving us a bit of a surprise when we
fired up our benchmarks more on that
later but it's also available in a less
expensive CPU only config there is no
question that hardline looks great mwah
but as a tinkerer if I was buying a bull
Tex
I might not configure it this way for a
couple of reasons flexible tubing
doesn't look as good I know but it gives
you quick and easy access for
troubleshooting or upgrades while
hardline requires you to dismantle the
whole loop in order to get at virtually
anything other than the ran and drives
one saving grace with this particular
machine though is that as long as you're
careful about it you actually could
probably pull the whole assembly out
through the top panel so unlike the main
gear Omen X with hardline you could swap
a failed component like a motherboard
without a plumbing certificate from the
local community college but we still
think that the happy medium is hardline
for the CPU only for easy graphics card
upgrades in the future or soft tubing
all around if you want the extra
performance and on that subject there's
plenty of that our asus rog Strix v2 7
TI gaming is equipped with an intel core
i7 7700 k and 32 gigs of DDR for 3,000
ram and as for the GPU well that's my
friends is what a water-cooled GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti looks like and the whole
thing is running off alien Lee 750 watt
80 + Platinum modular power supply fill
then it should come as no surprise that
even without the 5 gigahertz factory
overclock option our bull fax killed our
1080p gaming test suite but what might
be surprising is just how well it killed
it we gathered all of these
jobs at stock speeds for both the CPU
and GPU meaning that the performance
difference over our testbench here was
purely driven by the efficiency of
digital storms hydraluxe water cooling
loop no part of our system ever dropped
from max turbo which was totally why I
should have named my son max turbo
anyway sorry
even synthetic tests including a
combined load of fur mark and i-264
didn't manage to make it throttle which
is great result in a doomsday scenario
for any unified cooler and it doesn't
really get terribly loud while gaming
either with the fan spinning up to a
light bush under normal loads and only
really ramping up higher when under
those synthetic loads I mentioned before
we wanted to give you accurate numbers
for the noise levels but unfortunately
the studio is presently a construction
zone so yeah that's nuts not happening
the bottom line is it worth the price
tag well it's tough to say not because
we don't have the results or because
we're waffling on making a
recommendation it's actually because we
don't have a price tag yet digital storm
won't be releasing the bull text to the
public for another couple of months and
while the preliminary pricing that
they've given us says it will be
starting at fifteen hundred US dollars
they are starting configuration for the
bolt three at that price suggest that a
bolt X as shown here will cost a pretty
penny more than that but maybe that's
the point what you'll be getting what
the bull techs is a machine that
absolutely crushes it in terms of
performance and with Headroom for some
overclocking thanks to its excellent
cooling setup it is far from the
smallest gaming rig we've ever seen it's
even bigger than the last generation
bolt but it's still not unreasonable so
if you've got the cash and you want a
water-cooled gaming rig done right I
think the bull tax has got you covered
