school look like well we're here at
yumping vocational high school in talian
City Taiwan where they are currently
accepting applicants for the brand-new
gaming program that will officially open
its doors in September of 2018 so I
guess we're gonna find out after this
message from our sponsor private
Internet access
it's the VPN that's entirely
self-explanatory
it makes your access to the internet
more private
look at the link in the video
description to learn more
it's been a long time since I've had to
go to the principal's office and it was
never voluntarily but as a parent I've
got a lot of questions walking into
something like this but while I might
have started out thinking excuse me
gaming school I learned a lot during my
meeting with the principal
first of all young ping is one of 400
vocational schools in Taiwan and is now
ranked in the top ten with around 6,000
students so they do a lot more than just
gaming and I also learned that at this
time there isn't a full-time gaming
track any of the 100 or so students who
will be accepted into the gaming program
will be expected to pick another of the
vocations they offer like automotive
repair food graphic design or tourism as
sort of like a double major so to make
the obvious joke it is not all fun and
games and the gaming program will be
very demanding to ensure that students
have the right mindset not only are the
administrators and coaches going to be
looking at traditional acceptance
requirements like grades on Taiwan's
standardized tests but they're also
going to be interviewing applicants and
even yes you knew this one was coming
conducting tryouts with their gaming
coaches to evaluate their skills and
that is skills with a Zed now the school
already has an extracurricular eSports
team with a coaching staff of retired
players and they're building
partnerships we have affiliated local
teams like J team and MS that will allow
students to apply for eSports
internships but to make the experience
more school like they're gonna have to
think outside the box a little bit and
beef up their staff to cover not just
how to play video games but also a broad
range of gaming industry related
subjects so as a private school they
have the luxury to build their
curriculum so
we'll learn to build and troubleshoot
their pcs they'll study the different PC
components and their effects on gaming
performance they will learn principles
of game streaming on platforms like
twitch and even attend classes for less
obvious things like the history of
eSports and gaming and some PR and
marketing fundamentals so inside here is
one of their regular classrooms where
gaming program students will learn
traditional core subjects like Chinese
math English and history and also where
for example a tourism double major
student would study Japanese but that is
not to say that they won't also have a
real bona fide overwatch class where
they'll cover math analysis character
pro's and con's
individual strategies and techniques and
the teamwork and communication
principles that are necessary for
success in the highly competitive
eSports scene along with yes actual
homework assignments like achieve and
maintain gold rank and overwatch as you
can imagine it would probably be
beneficial to have sessions in a
computer lab to practice the techniques
that are being presented by the
instructor and I don't mean a computer
lab like this one I'm talking about one
like this this room cost three hundred
thousand dollars to build and they'll be
adding another one just like it before
the students arrive in the fall and then
this kind of computer lab would have
been my dream in high school there are
about 25 gaming machines in here
equipped with core i5 processors and gtx
1066 gig video cards they've got a vr
gaming space right smack dab in the
middle of the room and they've got a
fantastic streaming setup in here
including RGB tout gaming themes Dacor
pan tilt zoom cameras for the players
and the commentators and a quad TV setup
down at the end for spectating in person
like these guys do not mess around
they've got like 75 Hertz monitors
Cherry MX blue gaming keyboards pretty
much
freaking works but as cool as it all is
I wouldn't be surprised if the majority
of you still think video game high
school makes more sense as a web video
series than as an actual thing for you
I've got a challenge why don't you try
thinking about it a slightly different
way so in the same way but not everyone
who enrolls in a cooking vocational
program will become a world-famous chef
not everyone who enrolls in this gaming
program will become a champion eSports
player and that's okay because there's a
lot more to the gaming industry as a
whole than just playing games
competitively these days gaming bars are
growing in popularity gaming and food
program anyone gaming hotels are
starting to spring up gaming and tourism
sounds like a great background for that
kind of work and the gaming
organizations that used to subsist on
scraps are now playing tournaments in
major sports arenas with organizations
like Epic Games committing a hundred
million dollars of funding in prize
money towards their games it's crazy
even within the computer hardware
industry remember these are the
companies that make gaming gear I have
personally experienced a huge need for
representatives who actually understand
gaming and gamers to help their
companies address the growing market
that they represent you can learn about
gaming after you enter the workforce but
if you know that that's what you want to
do with your life then this whole thing
here starts to make a lot more sense and
I still haven't even mentioned the
connections element this is a huge and
often undervalued part of choosing the
right school attending a vocational
school means that you graduate with a
large cohort of passionate people with
similar aspirations who can work
together to get into the careers that
they want and support each other as they
enter the workforce so I walked into
here a skeptic
and I still have my doubts I'm sure
there's a lot of work to be done but it
makes far more sense to me walking out
than it did walking in so I guess I got
taken to school today
