codename Broadwell EP based eons I mean
these things are bananas the
top-of-the-line one has 22 cores 45
Meg's of cash a quad channel ddr4 memory
controller and best of all did I mention
that we've already got one no I didn't
because that would be a lie we have to

description now as impressive as the e5
$26.99 v4 might be under the hood CPUs
are never really much to look at
physically but that won't stop us from
investigating some of the differences
between this and the older has well
based the three processors so first of
all they've redesigned the heat spreader
I don't know exactly what the
engineering reason for these little
flanges that come out into the corners
are but if I had to guess I would say it
would be to transfer the contact
pressure of the CPU heatsink onto the
pads and the pins in the socket below
more evenly and then the other thing
that they've changed is it no longer
overhangs the socket and it's actually
closer to the size of a desktop chip
then the previous leon's were with these
like ultra super mega wide heat
spreaders on them now there are some
similarities here and this will be good
news for high end desktop enthusiast
users or workstation users who are not
necessarily going to drop I think this
one's like 4500 US dollars on a 22 core
model but might be interested in a hike
or count model and that is that it uses
the same 2011 contact pads on the bottom
and is therefore socket compatible with
LGA 2011 3 meaning that as long as your
motherboard maker provides a BIOS update
this will be a drop-in replacement for
the older VIII's and
even desktop processors assuming you've
got a board that will support it so
naturally then the first thing I'm going
to do is throw it on my gaming desktop
test bench and see how it goes but
before we do that I want to get some bit
oh did I just die that was quick anyway
before we do that I want to get some
baseline numbers on a 59 60 X Extreme
Edition desktop processor so we have
something to compare this brand-new
top-of-the-line 22 core against
benchmark wise I'll be doing a very very
limited set so we'll be running Crysis 3
to represent gaming will be running
Cinebench as well as w prime so with our
baseline numbers run all that's left to
do is find out if our motherboard has a
BIOS update we can't tell because a
Suisun for everyone for that matters
BIOS update release notes are
notoriously terrible so all we can do
now is update to the latest one tear the
system apart and give it a shot all
right moment of truth
yeah this is not looking like it is
going to work we're getting a postcode
53 maybe it will change and no but
that's okay because this is just a minor
setback Broadwell e the enthusiast
desktop equivalent for Broadwell EP is
not set to land for however long I
actually have no idea so it makes sense
I guess that some of the more desktop
oriented boards would not have Broadwell
EP support but that's okay because we
have a system that definitely does this
is eight gamers one CPU the Michael Bay
style sequel to seven gamers one CPU
it's bigger it's better it's better and
it's also deceptively named because in
addition to actually running two CPUs
because come on quite frankly if you've
got a workload that can benefit from 22
cores and 44 threads as I mentioned that
cqs hyper threading then you've probably
got a workload that can benefit from 44
cores and 88 threads so we're going to
be using this bad boy to deceptively put
two CPUs in and also deceptively run up
to ten gaming VMs but it's going to be a
little bit different because this
chassis supports and you'll see here
hopefully there we go supports eight
video cards and it's sort of advertised
configuration but thanks to its 11 PCIe
16x slots onboard 10 gigabit networking
dual 10 gigabit networking I am planning
to put an additional two cards in here
to hopefully get 10 gaming VMs running
and streaming using steam in-home
streaming to 10 different clients all
over the building
instead of having everyone tethered to
the system this time so what we've got
to do then is apply the latest BIOS
update and throw the CPUs in here for
our testing
but before we put the 22 quarters in
that machine I actually had to pull out
the 8 ZOTAC gtx 980ti amps and replace
them with just one tight next so I could
get an apples-to-apples comparison
against my top-of-the-line desktop 59 60
X the cool thing here is that this is
2:18 course the previous flagship before
that the flagship e5 was a 12 core we
actually have one of those in Ed's
machine maybe let me know in the
comments if you'd like to see a
generation by generation comparison
there and so we've gone from 12 to 18 to
now 22 cores but and this is really
interesting
the $26.99 v4 that we have actually has
24 physical cores on it meaning that if
they were to create an additional 24
course key when yields improve or
whatever they potentially could which is
pretty cool so we ran through the same
benchmarks Christ a3 Center bench and W
prime but it should be noted at this
time that W prime no matter how many
threads I set it to isn't really scaling
so I might just leave that out so with
that out of the way then alright let's
put some 22 core CPUs in here this lock
and load
here we go 44 oh dang it doesn't matter
how experienced I get at this stuff
still forget to plug in the power supply
sometimes okay try that again
lock and load
44 cores
hilariously that's not nearly as loud as
it was when we have the default fans in
here I actually posted a periscope
stream of me turning it on for the first
time it was deafening
please turn on
oh hello hey wow that was the longest
post I've ever seen in my life
oh okay then let's get into the BIOS
here what the hell was that like they
want me to have a freaking heart attack
forty-four core machine not turning on
cheese why is it that my stress is your
entertainment hey where's my BIOS screen
okay so that's it
video card is still detected all good in
the hood
Wow
that my friends is what 44 cores
88 threads looks like just like that
stock speed of this puppy actually not
much higher than the previous one in
fact I think it's a touch lower but you
do get architectural improvements from
going from Haswell to Broadwell for the
microarchitecture of the CPU itself um
and let's see what that translates to so
we'll fire up
let's do Cinebench as our first run here
because I guarantee you none if our
almost none if any of you have ever seen
a Cinebench run that looks like this
and done over 5,000 points 5214
unfreaking real I certainly have never
seen anything like it let's run it again
just cuz hey it doesn't take very long
right so CPU usage a hundred percent
across forty four cores eighty eight
threads yeah whatever no big deal but
kind of run Crysis only one way to find
out okay so while I haven't run the
benchmark yet I think I can say with a
fair degree of certainty that yes yes it
can because all tabbing out reveals that
Crysis 3 is utilizing 5.6 percent of the
CPU 6 ok whole sorry six point six point
four is what we peaked at there oh ha ha
well whoa how is that even possible ok
it's actually using it reasonable doubt
of it you can see most of its on this
one random core right here but there are
some other other course oh and then it
fell back down again alright so let's do
this let's run the bench can't it run
Crysis
I don't know what prices threes music
sounds like this thing I can't screw up
my junk there that's okay boom so all
that's left now is a bit of a wrap up
yes it can play crisis is a silly
question of course it can it's got about
the power of multiples of our highest
end desktop processor in it but it's
only really truly utilized in more
multi-threaded workloads like for
example Cinebench that is high in 3d
rendering or in a heavily virtualized
environment like what I have planned for
it in terms of power consumption and
temperatures once again I'm impressed in
spite of the 22 cores under the hood our
total system power consumption at idle
is around 200 watts
remember that includes those beefy fans
over there and our low power consumption
is around 500 watts with i-264
running full tilt in the background
let's go ahead and pull that up our load
temperatures even with these goofy
coolers I mean they're good coolers but
they're not amazing is under 50 degrees
it does help to be able to spread out
the cores when you've got lots and lots
of course you have a larger heat source
so it's a little bit easier for the heat
to transfer so I think that pretty much
wraps it up what was the point of this
video well point number one is holy shit
that's cool point number two is that
while this is not something you're going
to be running in your desktop you know
now the thing to note about these kinds
of Technology showcases is that all this
stuff eventually does trickle down I
mean remember 12 core like two and a
half years ago was the top of the line
for servers and now the rumor is that
Broadwell II the desktop version of this
is going to have a 10 core Extreme
Edition so there you go it's a sight of
what's to come if nothing else
Tinh is an unusual mobile carrier one
that's focused on customer service and
customer satisfaction first
when you call them about to blow your
mind you do not speak to a robot
it was pretty disconcerting the first
time I did it I called someone's like
hello and I was like what wizardry is
this you actually get put through
directly to a person who asks you what
you want and takes care of you and you
don't actually have to pay a whack ton
of extra monthly fees for that service
in fact the average tingle is only $24
per month per device hold on a second -
why would it be like an average bill why
wouldn't they just have like contract
rates because that's not the way ting
works it's all about using what you use
and paying for exactly what you use so
in order to find out if ting would be
better for you all you need to do is
head over to linus ENCOM linked in the
video description and try out their
savings calculator you enter your last 3
bills and how much you paid for them and
then your actual usage and boom ting
shows you how much you would be saving
if you're stuck in a contract and you
switch to ting we'll cover 25% of your
cancellation if you up to 75 bucks and
if you sign up using our link you'll
also get $25 in service credit or
towards a new device so thanks for
