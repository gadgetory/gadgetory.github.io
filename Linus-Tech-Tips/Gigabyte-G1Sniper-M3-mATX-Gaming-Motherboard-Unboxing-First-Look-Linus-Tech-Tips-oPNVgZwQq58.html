a product that is actually very exciting
now the whole performance micro ATX
motherboard thing I guess I'd have to
say was really started by EVGA back in
the socket nine three nine days so they
have their sli motherboard which was
using shoot what chipset was that wow
that fails me at this point but whatever
okay so they they had a truly
performance oriented micro ATX
motherboard which was later sort of the
concept of which was later copied by dfi
and then and then asus got on board with
their gene series of motherboards and
now finally gigabyte has a truly
legitimate high-end em ATX board so this
has all the usual features so we'll
start with what they got on the front
here so this is a z77 board which means
we do have support for virtue MVP third
generation intel core series processors
i3 s i5 and i7 s including support for
pci express 3.0 it is SLI and CrossFireX
ready meaning if you're running a 7970
which i happen to have one of over there
or a gtx 680 which i happen to have one
of over there those are PCI Express 3.0
ready graphics cards that will run in
SLI and crossfire with double the usual
bandwidth so PCIe 3/8 X and 8 x will be
equivalent to pcie 2.0 16 X 16 X we've
also got their patent-pending 3d power
as well as 3d bios so that's their dual
UEFI BIOS so that's two independent
chips and then their 3d power is they're
all digital power delivery system that
they're using on this board what else we
got here SuperSpeed so we're using intel
Gigabit Ethernet
we have SATA 3 USB 3 and 3x power this
has been a popular marketing scheme for
gigabyte since they introduced it and I
think it's awesome because yeah it means
you got all the highest speed interfaces
and the 3 times power thing is cool
because it means that you can deliver up
to 3
the amount of power through a single
port as you can with a standard port
which allows you to run more devices off
of a single part which is cool okay
super hearing creative sound core 3d so
they do have a dedicated section of the
PCB for their for their headphone
amplified sound what else we got here
super shield so for smart fan connectors
multiple GPU support listed virtue lucid
virtu MVP so virtual MVP is the upgraded
version of lucid virtu that comes with
these e77 platforms so you've got the
virtual vsync as well as some
performance improvements and less of a
performance hit when using virtue versus
just using a dedicated graphics card
compared to previous generation products
all right we've got suicides you got the
poster I showed you here's some you know
stickers that I guess you might think
are cool all right here's a user's
manual as well as an installation DVD
which you can not use and download
latest off the DB by website it's fine
as well as finally a multilingual
installation guidebook we've got six
SATA cables three right angle and three
straight
we have black flexible SLI cable the
very best kind and we have an i/o shield
with everything conveniently labeled
next we have the motherboard itself
gigabyte has done a fantasy really like
build gigabyte is just out of sight out
of mind for me at this point because the
new gigabyte which seems to be all about
wicked awesome color schemes great
aesthetics as well as their stable high
quality design is just yeah way very
much improved and I love it so check out
this board it looks fantastic we've got
a stylish looking heatsink no guns no
bullets just a sleek overall look four
pin power connector up here now some
people have in our assembly department
actually commented on the four pin power
connector in spite of this being a
performance board to which I said come
on guys the platform the highest TDP CPU
on it is a 95 watt TDP CPU we're not
talking you know high power consumption
here
and I thought it was silly back when we
were putting do lay pins on 11:55 boards
anyway a four pin is going to be just
fine don't worry about it
alright so there is your digital power
delivery your four pin power as well as
your four dims supporting dual channel
memory so remember guys with z77 as well
as third-generation core series
processors we do find it easier to
overclock the memory and get high
frequencies out of your memory so if you
wanted to invest in a higher end memory
kit I guess now's as good a time as any
your 24 pin connectors in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge and
your front USB 3.0 headers right about
here remember guys this is running off
the dedicated Intel USB 3 that is built
in to the Intel chipset these are no
longer running off of third-party
chipsets here we have to say 2 3 6
gigabit per second ports running off the
Intel chipset as well as 3 SATA 2 3
gigabit per second ports also running
off the Intel chipset the sixth one
running off the chipset is right there
on the back panel and yeah ok ah well
cover the fan headers later here's your
front panel connectors as well as your
increased power front USB 2 header so
you want to plug that into your front
USB 2 as opposed to the other ones here
because it'll allow you to quickly
charge even a high draw device such as
an iPad here are two regular USB 2 front
panel headers as well as the trusted
platform module and front panel audio
you can see the dedicated section of the
PCB is right over here which is good
ok PCI Express slot leo so this is a 16
X slot this is and you gotta be kidding
me really well that's a very strange
layout okay well this is a PCIe 16x slot
that is only wired for 4x so this is
going to be the one that is not
preferable to use especially if you
aren't running a third generation
processor this one is wired for 8 X so
if you're running crossfire or SLI these
two are going to give you the ideal
bandwidth split this guy is running at
PCIe 1x I never actually covered the
socket so whether you're running Sandy
Bridge Ivy Bridge or even yeah Sandy
Bridge or Ivy Bridge this will have full
support in
looting the onboard GPU which brings us
around to the back of the board where
we've got one two three four USB 2.0
ports a ps2 port I still do like to see
this VGA DVI display port as well as
HDMI output so you have the full range
of outputs remember the the IGP on the
third generation core processors
actually supports three monitors out
which is very very cool eSATA two more
USB 3.0 ports provided by the Intel
chipset an Intel Gigabit Ethernet as
well as 7.1 audio out including optical
audio out on the back of the board we
find your typical back plate and that is
a matte black PCB I know I've stopped
commenting on it as much these days but
that doesn't mean I like it any less
matte black PCB is still the way to go
aha the fan header so we've got one two
three four four pin pwm fan headers and
I think that pretty much covers it so if
you're putting together an EM ATX
performance rig with the new Ivy Bridge
CPU and some kind of combination of
high-end graphics and an SSD and all
kinds alright Intel SRT technology if
you don't want to run a dedicated SSD
for your boot drive you can still use
your SSD as a cache that is supported as
part of the z77 platform and I don't
even see anything about it on the box oh
yeah there it is see easy Smart Response
gigabytes way of setting up Smart
Response is actually easier than anyone
elses by a longshot it's basically like
a OneTouch setup to get everything
running so thank you for checking out
