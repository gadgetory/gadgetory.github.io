the DP 700 from Samsung this is their 7
Series multi-touch gesture capable high
resolution all in one featuring Windows
8 I know I sent a lot of stuff just now
and maybe not all of it necessarily sunk
in but I'll cover it in more depth as we
go along so check this out
that is some fine packaging we got going
on there soft foam keeps this thing very
safe in transit I mean it's got like 2
inches temp like 6 inches of soft foam
around it at every possible angle which
is amazing I mean look how much look how
much foam is between the actual unit and
the edge of the box and this is this is
very awkward what I'm doing right now so
I'm going to go ahead and dump this out
on the floor because that'll be less
awkward and hopefully not break it oh if
I broke it it would be really bad I
think there's actually very few of these
in Canada right now so so yes it would
be incredibly incredibly bad so what we
find in accessory box number one is an
included mouse and keyboard these are
wireless there you go actually oh wow
very solid built in build quality for
what I would normally expect to be
pretty shoddy keyboards and mice
included with you know just this little
nice little touch like that aluminum
piece right here that's actual metal and
gives it a bit of a nice feel to it the
mouse is well okay the mouse is more
like what I'd expect to see included
with an all-in-one but realistically if
you're buying yourself a really nice
all-in-one like this you'd probably want
to invest in a proper wireless keyboard
and mouse from someone like a logitech
okay check this out I mean look at this
packaging this thing wouldn't break I
swear if you dropped it off a two-story
building like seriously alright next
accessory box we've got a power brick
and that is a brick but I mean remember
guys this is a desktop PC not a notebook
so it's not like it's going anywhere you
go ahead and plug that in there
that's going to power your all-in-one
experience all right
next thing we've got is the all-in-one
PC itself it's like the sword in the
stone if you can remove it from the
packing material then you can use it oh
that is absolutely gorgeous give me a
sec to get all the plastic off it and
number ready to go here one cool thing
that Samsung does include with this
all-in-one and one of the first things I
wanted to play with when I opened it up
is their gesture capabilities just like
they have on their Smart TVs so I was
trying to see if I could get it to
recognize my cat's hand as a palm so
that I could see if whoa I think it did
recognize something there good job
Rumble okay so let's put him down
gorgeous video yeah right so gestures so
there's a variety of different gestures
I'm going to totally cheat here because
there's a lot of stuff to remember so
you click like this you can close
programs by going like this you can
increase volume up and down they're
going like oh sorry like this and then
you can go to Windows Home and then you
can swipe left and right so that's kind
of cool it still acts it's still a
little bit quirky but I mean I wouldn't
worry too much about it because overall
the machine is so beautiful I mean I
have no validation of this bike here
come in and get like a really really
sharp angle on this this must be a pls
panel 2560 by 1440 HD plus pls panel
absolutely beautiful it is edge to edge
glass here so what that means is if you
swipe in from the edge you are going to
be able to take advantage of all the
different gestures that Windows 8
enables the overall I mean keep this
handy and keep like a rag handy because
it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet but
I go as far as to say that it's like
kind of worth it actually it's very
gorgeous very clean looking the metal
stand down here I think is a really nice
touch I've seen a lot of different bases
for all in ones some of them are kind of
quirky some of them look really nice
this one looks really nice it said it's
just a plastic finish here that's not
actually made of metal but it looks
metallic and it looks really really good
in terms of angles you can get a little
bit more than upright and then you can
angle it back like this which would be
appropriate for sort of like
lower desk and using it from above
touchscreen feels very responsive it is
a 10-point multi-touch so again fully
capable of all the different gestures
that you would want to play around with
in something like Windows 8 you can see
just like the colors it looks so good
but some let's actually take a closer
look at the physicality of the unit so
it's very slim this is one of the
slimmer all-in-ones that I've seen
especially considering it doesn't have
any apparent like uber cooling fans
going on it or anything like that it has
a 78 weight I have my spec sheet handy
has a 37 70 T so that's a low-power
processor because that's what you pretty
much have to use for something like an
all-in-one it looks like this is doesn't
have a button so you're going to eject
that with the operating system this
particular model has a 7850 with one gig
of dedicated ram which is important for
all of the elbe video acceleration of
everything that goes on in Windows 8 I'm
just going to let diesel sort of look at
the unit while I figure out the rest of
it
dual 14 watt speakers with tweeters so
those are Dolby certified as much as
that may or may not mean to you eight
gigs around included and that pretty
much does it for ok Gigabit LAN
Bluetooth Wi-Fi 720p front webcam and I
think that that's pretty much it so we
had the optical drive on that one side
let's go around to the other side and
see what we find there I'm expecting to
see some inputs and whatnot there we go
alright so we've got an SD card reader 2
USB 3.0 ports microphone and headphone
out jacks let's go ahead and tilt it
down here so you can see everything else
it has up display port out HDMI in which
is great which means five years from now
when you no longer care about you know
an all-in-one that's a five year old
spec you can go ahead and just continue
using it as a monitor USB oh they're
probably USB 2 would be my guess yep
three USB 2.0 ports one of which has the
wireless receiver for the keyboard notes
that are included HDMI out for a
secondary display Gigabit Ethernet
antenna in that one's blank on this one
Kensington lock is included here and
cooling is done through a variety of
they're speakers okay there you go
that's neat cooling is done with a
variety of vents in the bottom and up
here in the top although the fan is
quite quiet especially from the front of
the machine so you shouldn't have any
sort of difficulty with those aspects
because I'm not connected to the
internet right now I'm not able to take
advantage of that let's go ahead and pop
back to the Windows 8 Start menu
actually give me a moment here guys so
just an example of you know potential
usage model for a PC like this is you
know I'm cooking you know checking if my
banana bread is done I didn't make the
banana bread I'm incapable my wife made
it but I'm pretending that I don't have
a cook so that I can give an example of
how you might use the included
jamieoliver app which again because I'm
not connected to the network on this one
seems to be a bit of an issue that's
also good because it's a demo unit this
is pre-production but it includes a
Jamie Oliver cooking app that you can
use your gestures to kind of navigate
through recipes and stuff like that
because especially when your hands are
dirty you might think that it's sort of
handy to be able to just gesture at the
screen instead of getting your super
greasy hands all over it now there are
Samsung exclusive is being clean there
it is
okay sorry 5,400 of RPM one terabyte
driving here so intense the sort of the
first thing I'd probably do after I buy
something like this is throwing SSD in
it but yeah Samsung exclusive start menu
so does that look familiar to all of you
guys yeah it's the Start menu in Windows
8 which is not necessarily available
with everyone there's also some built-in
touchscreen controls here including mute
eject oh that's how you eject it or
maybe it's here oh there it goes Hey
eject for the optical drive it's a DVD
Drive although I believe it's available
in some regions with blu-ray menu
brightness hop volume up brightness down
volume down you can change the source
and you can turn this all that's handy
you can turn the display right off we're
turn it back on very nice thank you for
