going to turn into a segment but I'll
cover that in a moment
first off right now today we're going to
be looking at really high wattage power
supplies actually use more power than a
power supply that's tuned for your
computer that means power from the wall
so what we have is a 450 watt power
supply a 750 watt power supply a 1200
watt power supply and a 1500 watt power
supply we're going to run our 59 30 K
and a 980ti
through some stress tests using i-264
system stability test and fir mark just
to get the wattage up there and then
test each power supply read the wires
from the wall figure out what's going on
it's a very straightforward answer the
question style video and that's what the
workshop is going to turn into I've been
kind of grappling with what I wanted
this to be over the last few videos that
I've done in the workshop that being and
you can check these out up here the
where should case fans be or how many
case fans do you need video and does
your cable management actually affect
your thermals throughout your case video
there's gonna be more of these there's
already one on the schedule coming up
soon if you guys have ones that you
might want me to cover live testing
things in front of you guys on the
workshop set in the future hit me up on
Twitter or comment in the comment
section down below
my twitter should be on screen but just
in case it's at Luke underscore la Fr
I'd love to answer whatever crazy things
you'd like me to try to figure
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more
hello everyone this is future Luke this
is Luke from further on in the video and
I'm wondering right now if you guys
would be interested in the little
experiment there's me a strawpoll link
somewhere and I want you guys to vote
before you see the rest of the video
which power supply you think is going to
win which one is going to use the least
wattage from the wall to power this
computer in this scenario let me know
I'm interested what do you think so
we're gonna start off with the power
supply that was already in this test rig
this is my standard graphics card test
rig this is way too much wattage
potentially on the power supply so this
is a little bit overshooting it so after
that what I think I'm probably going to
do is step it down a little bit go to
the 750 then the 450 then do the 1500 I
after that we're gonna wait a few
minutes just to make sure that the power
stabilizes maybe three to five minutes
and then we will read the power wattage
reader from the wall that's plugged in
back here so I decided to change what
test we were using and went back to my
old school tried-and-true Crysis 3
skybox test because using i-264 system
stability test and fir mark gave me
variations of about 374 to about 405 I'm
going to continue onwards this is 350
one plus or minus three seems to be
pretty accurate within that range next
up is the 450 watt power supply let's
see it's it's within range I'm just
wondering how much watts it's going to
use how many watts it's going to use
English
well shooting video huh oh so the
monitors power was unplugged that almost
freaked me out all right here we go time
to load up Crysis 3 again do the skybox
test get our second set of numbers so
the variance on the 450 watt was 364
plus or minus 4 so a little bit more of
a variance window there and more wattage
but there's another interesting thing to
look at here when you step up in power
supplies your 80 plus rating almost
always goes up our 450 watt power supply
is bronze this next one I'm going to
test the 750 watt is gold the 1200 eye
is platinum the 1500 eye is titanium 80
plus rating they're more efficient we'll
get more into the efficiency talk a
little bit later on but for now time to
step up to the 750 alright our test with
the V 750 are done and the results were
345 watts plus or minus 1 that's our
lowest wattage amount yet but not our
highest 80-plus efficiency rating on the
power supply because just the rating is
not the only thing that matters let's
try the 1500 I that's the titanium rated
80 plus power spool just look at it it
requires a proprietary cable it's all
about efficiency curves we're probably
not gonna land on the right spot one of
the cool things about these videos is if
you watch it and you're like oh my
goodness you did this one specific thing
in a way that I don't think is right for
this test
cool tell me in the comments I'll do a
video and we'll see if it matters this
whole series is about like answering
questions that people might have or
exploring different things
alright so our last power supply is
installed the X 1500 is set up and good
to go if you guys thought I was rough on
it check out one of these videos where
we massively abused Corsair ax power
supplies not because we disliked them
it's mainly because they can take
alright let's run our last guy box test
so the 1500 I came down to 340 watts
plus or minus three at one in terms of
their positions the 450 watt was in last
place than the 1200 I then the 750 watt
then the 1500 I a little bit confusing
why you might ask it comes down to
efficiency charts which is actually
listed on all of these power supplies
which is great because it makes it
really easy for visuals the titanium
rated 1500 I it's peak efficiency on
American plug so 115 is at about 94
percent for instance if we move down to
that bronze rated one its peak
efficiency on North American plugs is
around eighty five percent it limits
things it doesn't mean that you can't be
very efficient on a say bronze rated
power supply it just means that to be
very efficient you're going to need to
be right on the sweet spot of the curve
and something like a titanium power
supply you're pretty much always going
to be pretty damn efficient but it will
be better if you got the sweet spot of
the curve and then that 750 watt had a
little bit of an irregular curve it was
a little bit earlier on where it peaked
where most of them were peaking right
around 50 percent so efficiency matters
eighty plus is a rating of efficiency
but you want to know where you are on
the curve that also matters find the
sweet spot for the power supply that
you're buying and try to make sure that
you're in it to save money on your power
bill but ultimately do higher wattage
power supplies use more power know that
no they don't crunchyroll is a site
