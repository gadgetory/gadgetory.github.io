to hawk these things netbooks these were
a big push from Intel and their partners
with the idea being that they were tiny
little laptops with really long battery
life and enough performance for net-like
tasks like web browsing one small
problem ok let's do another take only
one small problem
they were mostly so bringing us into the
current year it is 2017 and there is one
company that believes they can bring the
netbook back to its former glory GPD and
this is the pocket which smashed its
IndieGoGo crowdfunding goal raising over
three million dollars but does the
netbook really have a place in the
modern day
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise insulation and
optimization for different liquid cooled
radiator configurations learn more at
the link below
alright so rewinding everything you get
in the box for your four hundred and
fifty nine dollars if you buy it on
IndieGoGo or 599 six hundred US dollars
if you buy it retail is right here you
get a USB type-c cable you get a wall
wart with a Type C plug and you get the
GPD pocket itself in many respects this
is actually quite similar to their last
crowdfunded device the GPD win which was
more of like a more of like a kind of
handheld keyboard e thing with game pads
on it it was kind of like a gaming
device this one though it has similar
specs so it's got an atom x7z 8750 so
that is the top-of-the-line ultra
portable 2 watt cpu it's got 8 gigs of
ram this time 128 gigs of emmc
solid-state storage and it's got support
for both Windows 10 and Ubuntu now don't
expect the world's most amazing
performance but it can run Cinebench and
I mean lots of other day-to-day stuff I
mean here let's fire up a Chrome browser
that didn't feel too bad
fire up Netflix I mean it's quad core
processor 8 gigs of ram it's it's
actually fairly usable and they've made
a lot of other improvements since the
spiritual predecessor as well notably in
terms of build quality and display so
that's what a netbook felt like these
were like plastic cheap toys and this
one does cost a fair bit more but and
this doesn't seem to have been
unintentional here you get like this
unibody aluminum style construction with
the with the screws closing it in on the
bottom there and you get this really
rigid feeling screen the thing feels
really nice in the hand and for the
display instead of a low resolution
tn man if these come a long way you get
a 1080p IPS 7-inch display so that's a
pixel density it looks really good I
turned it down to a hundred and fifty
percent scaling because I found that was
kind of my sweet spot but it is very
very usable even at this size compared
to how much stuff you could put on
before seven thousand milliamp power
battery meant that our PC mark battery
life test came in at over five hours
which is a really impressive result for
running basically Full Tilt all the time
meaning that this thing and last but not
least with all those improvements plus
the fact that they've made it truly
pocket-sized is a really different kind
of device but there's always a but isn't
there there are some things that time
couldn't change and that's the size of
human hands the interface could be
better so some people will be thrilled
to see the nipple return from the IBM
ThinkPads of your but this split left
and right click and having them so close
with this Ridge here makes for not the
most ergonomic experience unless you are
really good at you know this kind of
this kind of work if you uh if you catch
my drift there also the keyboard
I don't know how anyone managed to make
a keyboard worse than a netbook their
previous device actually felt better
because it was intended to be used with
just your thumbs
whereas this sits in that awkward middle
ground where it's hard to use with
thumbs but almost impossible to get your
hands on they've made some very weird
changes I didn't realize just how off it
was until I tried to play a game and I
put my fingers on WASD and figured out
that W was way the crap over there like
I have some suggestions get rid of caps
lock why do we need a caps lock button
move backspace up so that I don't keep
hitting delete instead of backspace
that's very unnatural : really needs to
be here but then where do you put enter
I mean in some ways I do have ideas but
in other ways I just don't know how you
can fix this
and typing without a lot of specific
training on this device is going to be a
real challenge okay so next I want to
take a look at gaming performance but
while we wait for Windows Live or
whatever to install we decided to open
it up and have a look at the inside this
thing is like 60% battery so here's our
here's our Wi-Fi so there's our two
antennas there's our two watt CPU here's
our eight gigs of ram always love
opening this stuff up oh and actually I
guess now's a good time to check out i/o
so we've got a full sized USB 3
SuperSpeed we've got a headphone jack I
mean you can't take that for granted
these days my friends we've got a micro
HDMI I'm not a huge fan of this
connector but it's better than mini at
least in terms of fragility and more
importantly this is really cool we've
got a USB type C so that is used for
charging but it can also be used for a
dongle so something like this where you
can adapt that single port to multiple
USB HDMI gigabit networking I've
actually done it and I've also tested
this you can plug your dongle if you've
got one of those ones that's made for
the MacBook into the wall and the whole
thing will charge it'll power the dongle
your devices and the laptop if you have
a powerful enough wall board which is
pretty frickin sick so let's go ahead
and fire up Batman Arkham Asylum shall
we come on you rat bastard okay so
obviously the point of this isn't that
torchlight is the most difficult game in
the world to run but rather that for
basic games you actually can run them
directly on the device itself you can
see it medium to high settings we're
actually getting about you know 15 to 25
FPS which is yeah playable but not
really something that I would recommend
what I'm more into for a device like
this is thanks to its use of a decent AC
Wi-Fi chips
this is what I'm more interested in so
I'm using steam in-home streaming on a
gaming computer elsewhere in the office
and getting an utterly seamless 1080p
game streaming experience on this little
portable device hit the buddy know I
miss the buddy
and actually the audio experience on the
built-in speaker speakers they seem to
be a little confused themselves about
they call it a stereo speaker but last I
checked you need to physical speakers
for stereo audio some yeah it sounds
like it's coming out of one part of the
keyboard
the point is it's actually reasonably
loud and up to about 6065 percent volume
it's pretty distortion free it's a very
good experience which I guess leads us
to content consumption and we're going
from strength to strength here
1080p Netflix is looking really really
sharp on this little tiny display and
plays back with no dropped frames
whatsoever and it's actually it's nice
at the hinge folds back this far it's a
little bit inconvenient that it's kind
of hard to access the touch controls at
the very bottom like the windows taskbar
but in terms of like kind of sitting and
watching a movie on it honestly it's a
it's a pretty darn good experience and
1080p YouTube same thing so you're
looking at about 50% CPU usage if you're
watching like a reasonably fast-paced
video at Full HD but for me a lot of
those use cases are not that dissimilar
from what you could do with you know a
windows-based tablet so it becomes sort
of a question of form factor and i/o
this keyboard is going to require a lot
of adjustment but the pocket ability
kind of gave me a different idea for for
how I see this as something where out of
desperation you might actually use it
like this when you're sitting on a plane
or on a or on a train or something like
that but normally it's more about like
taking the vast majority of the local
storage you actually need like
128 gigs 8 gigs around like it's a
decent little machine and being able to
really carry it around with you and plug
it in with a single cable solution to a
desktop type display now it's running
older Intel HD graphics so it's like
DisplayPort 1.1 so at native resolution
on this ultra wide we're running it 30
Hertz or something like that and then
using an HDMI adapter here I think we
were only even able to get up to 1080p
but it is still the ability to just take
it plug it in and be using your computer
wherever you go that is very appealing
to me and enabled by USB type-c so I
guess the real question that is is would
you spend four hundred and fifty nine US
dollars on indiegogo or $5.99 retail on
it I guess it depends on the kind of
consumer you are if you were waiting for
a modern netbook I think they've done a
fantastic job but if you think the
netbook should have been buried put in
the trash can you do it again oh there's
no garbage can there this time well then

was awkward
